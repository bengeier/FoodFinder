{"text":"Looking to have a great tasting meal, fresh squeezed juice, or protein shake? G&P is the place for you.  They have gluten-free choices, a lot of organic choices and it's very affordable.  They even sell DNA Life Bars! Check them out after your next workout or just to have a fun lunch or breakfast with friends or even the kids!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite healthy places to eat in Las Vegas. I always get a Wellness Drink and a Broccoli and Cheddar soup. The food always comes out fast and consistently very good. I just wish there'e was more than 2 locations in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here after my workouts to \"treat\" myself. Their pizzas are all amazing, each 10\"s and each low in cals (250-300ish). Also try their tofu fries! Very tasty and also super low in calories. If you're trying to watch your waist but still crave some comfort type foods (and more), this place is the place to go!

(Also gluten free, vegetarian/vegan/raw friendly - major plus!)"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank the manager (or maybe it was the owner - anyway I'll just call him War Beard) who treated me really well. Ordered their chicken sausage pizza and took a seat. 

After a few minutes, War Beard approached my table and said \"the pizza is taking a little longer than expected. Would you like a complimentary drink while you wait?\" 

To be honest it wasn't that long a wait (it's never a dull moment when you have a Smartphone!) but I said \"sure, what would you recommend?\" He said \"How about a Wellness drink?\" And I said, \"go for it!\" 

Their Wellness drink is more of a juice than a smoothie and it's pretty darn good. Later I looked at the menu to see how much this complimentary drink normally costs - $7.50. That's not the cheapest drink around and yeah, lucky me, I got it comped, just because War Beard cares about his customers. 

I guess the point I want to make is that War Beard - whether he's the manager or owner - really knows the meaning of Customer Satisfaction. I don't normally write reviews on Yelp, but the service at this Eastern/215 Greens and Proteins convinced me to spend a little time writing this review."}
{"text":"Place to go for low calorie meals. I ordered from make your own menu which incorporates protein, greens and grains..They have nice variety of foods, stuff I haven't even tried before. 
Important thing is; food is very delicious and still very healthy for you.
Juices are very popular and absolutely delicious, 100% natural and packed with nutrients."}
{"text":"It is SO hard to find healthy food in Vegas! Normally I would probably give this place 4 stars but because it is so hard to find a healthy place to eat out they get 5 stars! Order the protein pancakes, turkey burger, or fruit juices! All delicious!"}
{"text":"EVERY single employee is so polite and informative. No matter who you talk to. I just experienced a customer being so rude to Chris and Memo and I just cannot believe how people can be so unfairly demanding even when the staff is bending over backwards for you!!! We eat here everyday and see all the cashiers, eat all the different chef's creations, and it is nothing but consistent and delicious and healthy and fresh every single time. We are forever loyal to this place thank you so much guys!!!"}
{"text":"Great menu choices, healthy ones at that! The Wellness Drink is the best greens drink I ever had but all of the drinks are great. The build-your-own with bison patty and spicy peanut sauce is my favorite but the seared ahi is also excellent."}
{"text":"I've mostly had the juices here, wellness juice is my usual. Most juices and smoothies have a fair amount of sweetness although most of the staff is open to slight adjustments to the recipe. The most vegetable based juice is V9, it's great though. Juices are made with a Vitamix. Restaurant has a laid back atmosphere.  You order your food at the counter and wait for your food at the table. Free wifi. Bright green decor makes me happy. Can order ahead, but don't call too far in advance, a juice sitting around too long thickens."}
{"text":"The food is great. The employees are great. I just call or walk in and they already know and remember my order. Food brought to you and tabled cleared for you. Yes it is pricier than most, but it is healthy, tasty food. Owner is involved and there in the mix bring food to tables. Liz is great. Right next to gym so after a great workout a great meal. Clean and pleasing atmosphere. Try it. Greg and his staff do it right every time. Like another lady said, it is my second kitchen."}
{"text":"Finding a healthy alternative to normal restaurants without sacrificing the actual taste of the food seems to be getting increasingly more difficult. Greens and proteins has finally mastered this problem and given people conscious of how they eat a place they can really enjoy. Lettuce cups are the best!"}
{"text":"First time for lunch at this location and I'm impressed with the friendliness, professionalism and service excellence of the staff. It's difficult to find a great vegan place to eat that doesn't contain salt, oil and sweeteners. They knocked it out of the park here!"}
{"text":"I love the fresh and crunchy sweet potato fries along with the green shake. Staff is very friendly... I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not sure what all of the fuss is about. Overpriced foods that I can make at home. The only thing I would actually pay for again is the green smoothie. Oh and the jicama fries are terrible."}
{"text":"Green Shake and Tofu fries are the only items worth getting. Both are exceptional!! However, the rest of the menu is 2/5 (and we've tried about 50% of it). Healthy food with very little flavor. Go here for a huge yummy superfood shake and eat real food at Lyfe Kithen instead."}
{"text":"Dinner here left me wishing that we had gone somewhere else. Their friendly service was about the only redeeming factor, and I'm still wondering if it could be the smoothies that bring people back here and keep it packed. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this, because I didn't try one. 

I had the build your own plate with basmati rice, \"marinated\" tofu, broccoli, and to my dismay, lemon vinegrette.
I began to order it with teriyaki sauce in mind, but when I inquired about the peanut sauce just to see, I was informed that the only two vegan sauces were lemon vinegrette or a balsamic reduction. Caught off guard I went for lemon, which turned out to be straight up lemon juice and olive oil. The tofu was far from marinated, and I smothered my food in hot sauce to make it a little more edible. The broccoli was just fine, but even a decent steamed vegetable doesn't have the power to save bland tofu and dry rice.

The tofu \"French fries\" were the only thing I tasted that I would even consider paying money for... But that won't happen since I won't be giving this place a second chance.
Perhaps it's a just a hit or miss kind of place, but if that's the case, then I would like to know what that hit is. I sure didn't get lucky."}
{"text":"Ordered food and a carrot juice drink some how didn't get the juice on the bill when the food was brought manager was awesome and didn't mind giving us the drink even though we were willing  to pay it he didn't charge us for it efrim is a good dude and has an awesome personality and food is always perfect. Rec everyone check them out!"}
{"text":"It was my first time & I did not like the acai bowl. The random pineapple and berries didn't taste good with the acai mixture. The acai itself was like icy not smooth and tasted odd."}
{"text":"I really love the food and juices here but there is always a problem. Today I called in an order 10 minutes before I arrived and came in and paid. I waited about 30 minutes inside before I asked someone about my order. They brought it out and said they forgot to bring it out and it was cold. THEN I looked inside and everything I ordered was wrong. It gets better. They then brought out my new order which was also wrong. So I've been waiting 45 minutes for 1 turkey burger and I'm quite disappointed"}
{"text":"Wow great food, very healthy & perfect after a good as work out. Very friendly customer service.  YOU GUYS DESERVE 5 start :)"}
{"text":"Unique blend of healthy and tasty all in one location.  Try it... You'll like it!"}
{"text":"Order the bison cheesesteak and the acai smoothie!
Chris and Justin gave excellent service with yummy suggestions :)"}
{"text":"Very clean, kinda pricey but you pay for quality food. Will be going back great experience."}
{"text":"I have been going the G&P for several years and it has been my go to restaurant for a clean and healthy meal.  I would not recommend the Decatur location because of the lower quality service and meals.  My last three visits have included a wrong take out order, over cooked meat in both wraps, and undercooked tofu fries."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is scrumptious!  The vegan pizza is delicious.  I love the cucumber water and the amazing juices.  I like to go here for lunch, and that is one of the only drawbacks.  It is insanely busy sometimes and hard to find a table, especially when people sit and chat at length after they have finished eating.  A lot of day working people use this as a lunch destination, so it's a bit annoying at times. The service is great, though.  Even at the busiest times, they are timely with the food.  The other detail I'm not crazy about is the kale salad.  Since it's mature kale, it's a bit tough, and it would be nice if they used baby kale or chopped it up a bit more.  Also, sometimes the dressing is a bit lip-pursing and sour."}
{"text":"First time trying out this place ordered a breakfast burrito but I never had a burrito come in all wet and how are you suppose to hold and eat when it's all wet? Little disappointed."}
{"text":"Foods good. Downside is the wait, but at least the food is always fresh and hot when served! Pretty packed at this location (the times I've gone). Good service as well! In for some healthy food, try this place out or better yet create your own protein style with sides meal"}
{"text":"I love this place. The breakfast is so yummy I questioned if it was really good for you but it is. Love the Bison Burger as well as all of their soups. The staff is beyond amazing and helpful! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If your a 110 lbs women or not very hungry this might be the place for you , if you don't mind paying $12 for a sub mediocre salad leaving hungry ,this might be the place for you as well .  I'm not either .  I went there after working out and I was starving, i figured I'd have a nice healthy salad. I ordered the large Albacore Salad , the guy at the front said it was good ,  when I opened it I almost peed my pants , it was 5 pieces of bibb lettuce , 2 cherry tomato's , a scoop of canned tuna and Dijon mustard (not mustard dressing) this was the large too , 
Generally I like to go to a place more then once to give an open minded review, but I'm not sure if I could bring myself back to give it another chance. The Daily Wellness is a much better place !"}
{"text":"I was skeptical before coming here today but I was extremely presently surprised!!  My party ordered a few items and shared -- the hummus appetizer, greek pizza, bison burger with jicama fries, a veggie wrap and apple pie smoothie.  We were very happy and satisfied! The service was fast, attentive, the quality was great and the food was cooked just as specified. I'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Glad to c another restaurant with some raw food options.  Would be nice if they had some fresh pressed green juices and some raw salad options."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins is a great option if you are looking for something quick, yet healthy.  The skinny chef salad is a favorite of mine!  You can also get 1/2 salad, which is nice if you are not too hungry.  I would go there just for the free cucumber/lemon water!!  It is so delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"Great healthy  food. I usually go after my morning  workout.  Friendly staff , clean tables, TV"}
{"text":"The wellness drink is fab, and the wraps are wonderful. A little on the pricey side but the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Love Greens & Proteins. I eat at this location quite often and the staff is really nice. Great location right off the 215 and tucked in with Starbucks. They are in the same plaza as a breakfast place so they cannot serve some of the breakfast dishes here. Example: they don't have the Greens and Proteins breakfast burrito. 
Tip: You can call in an order or Yelp an order and pick it up here; very convenient."}
{"text":"Truly one of the best restaurants we've ever been to, the vegan raw cashew chicken lettuce wraps were incredible, so fully satisfying and the service was impeccable. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is aswome, great casual spot with really healthy and tasty food!  Great vibe--one of the proprietors, Jeff, even visited our table to see how we were doing and regaled us with interesting stories of his youth."}
{"text":"So fresh!  I love this place.  I only give it a 4 star because it's a bit pricey.  I love the fact that they have ostrich!  Hard to find.  There's so much on the menu that I have to try.
Tasty, healthy food, what more cold you ask for?  Don't forget to try their cucumber water.  So refreshing on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"They have some of my favorites- the greek scramble is my absolute favorite breakfast item on Earth. I also get the low-carb caesar salad on the regular! However I recently had the 7 cheese vegetable broccoli soup and I was pretty disappointed. It was extremely bland. So food-wise, I would say they are kind of hit and miss.

The staff are always very kind and polite. They get busy in the afternoon, so I usually place an order on the phone and then pick it up to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! The bison cheese steak is A+++ I wanted to try other menu item,but I'm hooked. It's a good portion size for the price. I usually bring one half home for later. I highly recommend the antioxidant chiller as well it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast here with a Groupon. I had a smoothie and the breakfast burrito - both were delish, and the tofu fries were too!  It is pricey though!"}
{"text":"Awful experience here today.  I work in the Las Vegas service industry so I am fully aware of service standards. When I walked in at 4:30pm there was no one in line.  I knew what I wanted to order so I went straight to the register to place my order (1 Apple Pie Smoothie).  The two female employees prepping ingredients continued to chit chat with themselves, not acknowledging my presence for a full minute of standing at the register.  Finally one came over and took my order, my name, and payment.  The other employee started working on my smoothie.  I watched her pour in almond milk and then dump at least a CUP of nutmeg in my smoothie and gasp 'Oh my God' to the other employee.  (A little sprinkle of nutmeg goes a long way).  The two of them decided it best her her to  scoop the nutmeg out with her gloved hands.  Unsuccessfully, she decided to start my smoothie over (thankfully, as I watched her like a hawk, regretting having just paid $8 for a smoothie).  Meanwhile the other employee helped the two customers behind me as I watched employee 1 take her sweet a$$ time re-making my smoothie.  The other employee managed to make FOUR other smoothies (for customers behind me) in the time it took employee 1 to make one smoothie.  This all took about approx 10 minutes.  Then, employee 1 tried to give my smoothie away to another customer behind me.  I finally walked up and said, \"that's for (my name), right?\" \"Oh oops, here you go!\" was her response to me.  No 'sorry about the 10 minute wait'.  Sorry Greens & Proteins, no matter how hungry I am and how hard it is to get a healthy snack when I'm all the way across town, I will faithfully use my own Blendtec at home and make better, cheaper smoothies.  And I\"ll make sure to tell my friends."}
{"text":"Incredible!! My fiancé & I are doing a show on the strip & it's a must that we have our Greens & Proteins. So much so that we have the shows runner make the daily run for aftershow food. We love Tyler. -It's known for it's incredible seasoning. I love the bison cheesesteak wrap."}
{"text":"Really great place with tons of options. The service is always very prompt and I love that you can get some clean items so you don't feel guilty when eating out. I had the salmon with a walnut pesto sauce that came on the side but I added it on my salmon and it was delicious! It came with two side choices and I did quinoa and grilled asparagus. Minimal to no seasoning which I like as it's better that way. 
Their juices are all so delicious too! Really good sizes and they are nice and thick that you almost feel like you are drinking a smoothie.
Whenever I come to visit the area to see family I come here at least once and I'm always happy!"}
{"text":"Had the teriyaki chicken wrap but made it vegan with tofu and lettuce wrap.  What a waste of $10.99!  

Lettuce (romaine I think) was very tough and hard, simply wrapped around a bunch of tofu (looked like the tofu fries before being breaded and cooked).  Not wrapped at all so all the filling fell out as soon as I picked it up.  The tofu was supposed to be marianated, but it certainly wasn't.   When I marinate tofu in teriyaki sauce, it absorbs the marinade and turns brown.  G&P's tofu was still white and flavorless.  Supposed to include cukes and something else.  Nothing but a lettuce leaf, flavorless tofu and sauce (which dripped all over the plate).   When I went back to the counter to talk to the manager, I was told they weren't in!

This place blew it.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went into the Decatur location and there was not one guest. There were two girls folding pizza boxes who instead of greeting me or helping me clearly wanted to make me feel uncomfortable and giggle. Another employee thankfully helped me while they continued to make me feel uncomfortable. The next guest was greeted by them and helped. Not sure what's so important for them to make someone who helps pay their check by bringing business uncomfortable or why folding pizza boxes has priority over helping a guest. I wish I could give the guy working a separate review because he was kind and helpful."}
{"text":"This place has really good smoothies. The food wasn't bad but I'm just not into healthy eating. My health conscious bf loved it though."}
{"text":"First time coming here and we fell in love with this place,their Bison wrap is the best,this is our new favorite for healthy food!!!"}
{"text":"I love the wellness drink! The owner has been studying nutrition for years and really plans everything in the menu with the best possible nutrients.  Everything is amazingly fresh down to the cucumber lemon water.  I can not wait until they start catering!"}
{"text":"So far, I have only come in here for breakfast, but I have loved everything I'ved tried! This place is right by the gym so the location is very convenient. I've gotten the oatmeal with bananas, cinnamon, raisins. The mulitgrain protein pancakes and granola french toast have to be my favorites. I loved the turkey sausage and egg whites. The portions are pretty big, which I like because I can share with someone or take the rest home. I love the Berry Blast smoothie which is nice when I'm on the go and can't sit down to eat. I can stop in and just grab a smoothie. I have been here quite a few times and I notice that sometimes the food can take about 15-20 minutes to come out, even when I only have one entree for myself. Other than that, the staff is very nice, the place is clean, and the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times right when it opened, so maybe my opinion isn't the best one to go off of.  Regardless, I had a couple different veggie smoothies, and I liked them both.  The Wellness Smoothie is just what the doctor ordered, and then I had a one time creation from Shane, with watermelon rind in it, which I also loved.  I haven't tried the food yet, but am actually excited to see what they have to offer.  This is a great place if you are looking to add some fiber to your juice routine, which sometimes, I am!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite health food places in Vegas real food real tasty!! The ostrich patty is excellent and the smoothies are delicious especially the \"wellness\" drink. Pricey but most healthy places seems to be."}
{"text":"What an interesting place!  The feel of the restaurant is young and hip and the vibrant green of the decor makes the place feel fun and eclectic.  This is my first time here even though I often go next door and hit up Starbucks.  The menu is rather large and it will take you minute to read everything over.  They are gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, and low-carb friendly place that offers a nice selection of soups, salads, burgers, 9\" pizzas, smoothies, sandwiches/wraps and a choice to even create your own meal.  After pondering what to eat I decided on a burger.  What is more classic than a burger and if they could make it right then I would be encouraged to try more off the menu. 

I ordered the buffalo burger done to a medium (they also have ostrich which I have never had) and tofu fries.  There is also an option for the jicama fries.  I was told the jicama fries are fry-shaped pieces of jicama tossed in a dressing.  I shied away from the jicama because I have not had it before personally but I did hear they are good.  The tofu fries are firm tofu tossed in rice flow and fried.  They are delicious!  The burger can come on a wheat or gluten-free bun or as a wrap. I chose the wheat bun and got Swiss cheese on my burger.  The burger itself is massive stacked with a thick patty, lettuce, tomato and onion!  I can barely fit it in my mouth!  The bread to meat ratio for the burger is perfect.  I took a bite and the burger is done exactly right (medium), juicy and tender.  

For my buffalo burger, tofu fries, pickle and a soda cost me a little over $14 including tax.  A good price for a nice buffalo burger.  Also their soda machine dispenses small ice pellets.  This is an important point to make for my fellow ice munchers! 

The place is WiFi ready but you will have to ask for the passkey to access the network. When I asked the staff about power access they did not know but I was able to speak to Jeff, one of the owners, and he was able to show me where to plug in.  For those needing a place to work there are a TON of plugs (long power strips) under the bench along the back wall of the restaurant. Just a little looking and you will see them.       

If you are looking for a nice place to grab a healthy bite to eat (even with your GF, Vegan or Uber-health conscious friends)  then look no further than the Greens and Proteins!"}
{"text":"The Bison burger is delicious. The chicken quinoa salad was cool, fresh and tasty. Add avocado to everything because it's yummy. Add banana to the watermelon strawberry smoothie to make it a little creamier. The place is well decorated for a good atmosphere and well maintained. Bathrooms are clean too. Would love to have one of these in California."}
{"text":"Not a juice bar. They do not serve juices. What they do serve is smoothies. All drinks are blended and contain fiber. That is not a juice. If you want fresh cold pressed juice I suggest you try one of the many other legitimate juice bars in the area."}
{"text":"First time here, and can't wait to come back! 
The wellness dink is absolutely amazing! And my mom and I shared the raw macho nachos, and half an order of that was so filling! I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"The cashier was very helpful even though she had not tasted alot of the Vegan food but that is exceptional. The smoothie was very fresh tasting.Im not a big fan of vegan cheese but this pizza was actually taste."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go check out Greens & Proteins after I hit the gym for months now. I finally did this weekend and was pleasantly surprised with their GREEN SHAKE. I'm glad I chose to use almond milk rather than soy milk in the shake because I think the sweetness helped, but it was still tastier than what I expected for a shake that is mixed with spinach, collard greens and kale! After this first run I know I'll be back to try a few more smoothie options."}
{"text":"Delicious....... Don't hesitate. Just go!

Very cute inside. Nice, clean, classy. Makes me happy."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eatin at G&P so I thought i'de check check out their location just outside of my new hood- mountains edge. I needed a meal to take to work so I called my order in.  I was in the mood for something healthy and satisfying and the dude on the phone recommended the bison cheesesteak wrap.  Got there about 10 minutes after ordering and my food was ready to go. The wrap held up nice during my commute to work. When I finally got to eat the thing I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of meat with the perfect proportion of veggies and low fat cheese, and the spinach wrap added a nice touch. I had it with the sweet potato fries, because hey, we all need to cheat on our diets once in a while. They were bomb too! Will definitely keep this place in mind for quick healthy food options. Very convinient and delicious. Looking forward to trying out their other menu items. I already have the Cajun steak sandwich in mind!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites. I usually get the bbq chicken pizza on lavash. It tastes great and is low calorie. Service is always good despite having to wait in line sometimes (that means that it is good). My only complaint is that their wraps and burgers come with a choice of tofu fries or jicama fries as a side. I am not a fan of either and think sweet potato fries would be a great alternative."}
{"text":"Always love coming to this location. Terrible experinences at Flamingo location. Came in late night after a 12 hour day and Julie was polite, kind, and brought my food out with a good conversation. Shes two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with fresh eats and yummy shakes, this is it.  I really liked it, it seems unique and has really great \"healthy\" food.  Located near LVAC, it attracts that healthier, fit crowd; but I went for the shakes.  I do try to watch what I eat, and this place does not offer greasy and heavy food.  It's fresh and well proportioned.  Friendly, inshape (lol) staff and patrons as well."}
{"text":"You have to ask for the veggie burger to be prepared \"vegan\" style.  They delivered it to me with non vegan spread. So be careful if you are vegan as they do not cater to vegans. Also your burger will be cooked on the same grill that a ostrich or bison burger was cooked just previously with the grill merely wiped off before your vegan burger is cooked. The food is good, but not certified vegan. The wellness drink is good, but not organic. I would skip this place if those things are important to you."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, and still not impressed.

The customer service and staff are excellent, which is why I gave them two stars.
However, I have not had anything there that I liked yet. I am a huge smoothie fan, but there's aren't up to par. Have had much better in this area of town."}
{"text":"Im hooked! I keep coming back to this place for my healthy meals. The food is great my favorite is the breakfast, I enjoy eating the multi grain pancakes. I really appreciate the staff and chef ceasar for the excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I had a green shake and left pleasantly surprised. Slightly on the high side for prices, but fresh and good. I will return"}
{"text":"Some of their drinks are an acquired taste, but it's fun to be adventurous in the name of \"good for you.\" Food items haven't failed me yet. Only downer is the prices are slightly higher than seems fair.

Healthy and tasty, free wifi, and great customer service, too."}
{"text":"Manager Greg and staff took good care of me... my smoothie is delicious and I will definitely be back for more, if U're looking for healthy food that taste good and good for you, this is the place!! Oh did I mention the Chocolate Peanut Smoothie is my new drink, it's soo delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite health food places in Vegas! I'm really big in to health and fitness, and this place definitely meets the needs of health freaks, while also giving some more indulgent options as well. No matter what I always order the Wellness Drink every time I go. SO AMAZING and packed with fresh delicious ingredients. If you're a green juice person, this is the drink for you! I also usually always order their barbecue chicken pizza. The crust is amazing, the thin crust and the gluten free, I've had both, and the sauce and flavor is just incredible and the pizza only has 320 cals! How awesome. I have also had one of their wraps, forget the name but it's packed with a ton of vegetables and comes with tofu fries. So delicious, except I would say that the asparagus in the wrap was just a little too crunchy for me and kind of threw off the texture of the rest of it. I also have been to the Henderson location many times, and I must say this location just does it was better! The shape of their pizza is better and the taste of their smoothie was amazing.. but overall.. LOVEEE greens and proteins! definitely go if you have the chance! you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Daniel, the general manager, is such a delightful person. He was extremely patient and helpful with explaining and recommending options on the menu. It was my first time at Greens & Proteins, and the food is fantastic. I ordered the green shake and a BBQ chicken pizza (square) - super thin crust and vegan cheese. I highly recommend this place. I wish there was a location in Irvine or Los Angeles, CA. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"After about a dozen orders, mostly carryouts, the service and quality have declined steadily. My first several visits easily merited five stars. However, the always cheerful welcome has been gone for a while, and tonight's carryout meal was a disappointment. The salmon was good, but the avocado portion was small and so full of brown spots that I wouldn't eat it. The watery mashed sweet potatoes were not tasty. Furthermore, the cashier closed the cash drawer with a hasty thanks and goodbye but without the change I was due. Until I see a string of favorable reviews I'm taking my smoothie business to the nearby smoothie restaurant, and my healthy meal business to the nearby protein restaurant. I'll be back at some point, with the hope of providing a more positive review."}
{"text":"I must say I am not the healthiest person buuuut I finally got the chance to go in and check out this place that many of my co-workers would speak of. I had the bison burger and it's by far my all time favorite burger!! Everything is fresh and the meat is just perfect. I also enjoy the wellness green juice. Every now and then I call and schedule it to pick up. The guy that's usually there is a young man named Raul that always takes good care of us and makes sure that our food and juices are top notch. Excellent customer service by him and the rest of the greens and proteins team. By the way get the sweet potatoes fries!!!! You go g&p!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and smoothies here. Usually get great customer service but today not so much. Cashier kept looking into the kitchen talking to a co worker after each question she asked me. Had to repeat myself multiple times due to her not listing to me. Then she went on to drink her drink infront of me as i tried to order. The cashier needs some basic customer service training."}
{"text":"Healthy AND delicious! The jicama fries were awesome. Really nice environment and surprisingly easy parking for Downtown Las Vegas. I will be back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"It actually makes me very sad that I'm writing this because I was so looking forward to finding a good healthy place to eat. Everyone was really friendly, from the cashier to the manager, and their customer service was excellent. I can't say the same about the food. First off, I ordered the \"wellness juice\" which isn't a juice at all, I watched the girl prepare it throw vegetables into a blender and it was this disgusting, warm slush of liquid-y vegetables. I'm a green juice hound, and I don't know why they market their drinks as \"juices\" if they're more like slushed-up smoothies? The smoothie-thing had a horrible aftertaste like the vegetables had gone bad, and I only took one sip before throwing it in the trash. Secondly, I ordered an albacore salad which was literally a lump of canned tuna thrown on top of a bed of lettuce. I don't know who decided to call this thing a salad but it's definitely not what most people would consider to be a salad. The lump of canned tuna and lettuce bed was horribly tasteless and the lettuce was wilted and soggy. It makes me so sad that I didn't find what I was so hopeful to find in greens and protein. I was really excited to find my new favorite healthy cafe. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the employees were really friendly & helpful. But unfortunately, the horrible food was a dealbreaker for me, and I won't be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times in the past and I never got the chance to review this place. Greens and Proteins never dissatisfied my visit, all of their food and smoothies are great. My favourite is the Chocolate Veggiechino, the best stuff to get through your morning in a good mood! Also the Tofu Fries are a must-have too!
This time I decided to order the Granola French Toast, which is fantastic and don't be fooled by the small portions. After 4 small toasts it really filled you up."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!! I eat here often, and once I forgot to replace the regular cheese in a salad with Goat cheese and the girl taking my order remembered and reminded me!  Now that's Service!"}
{"text":"Good Smoothies and Juices but ehh on the salads and over priced.

I guess if you stick a healthy label on a restaurant you would always expect to pay high prices. 

What I do like are the juices and smoothies as their made from real fresh ingredients. The last time we were here we ordered the \"Green Shake\"; \"Green Ginger Limeade\" and the \"Albacore Tuna Salad\"

The \"Green Shake\" comes with Banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Sounds like they put the kitchen sink in this shake but you can taste hints of every ingredient. You get a dose of fruits and vegetables and an added extra protein burst with the almonds. You can substitute this for a meal as it's very filling. 

The \"Green Ginger Limeade\" comes with Green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, agave nectar. Its a very refreshing drink and its not filled with a bunch of sugars. One of the things I love about this drink is the ginger. It does not overpower the drink as it adds a unique sweetness. 

The \"Albacore Tuna Salad\" comes with Tomatoes, celery, cucumbers and bibb lettuce, Dijon dressing. Now this was such a big disappointment. My thoughts ordering this was I was going to get seared tuna on top of greens but to my surprise it was canned tuna and the large size was priced at 9.99. I felt like I just got ripped off. The dressing was also a little too strong with the Dijon but at least it killed the taste of the canned tuna. 

I would definitely come back for the Juices and Smoothies but would hesitate to order another salad. There are other selections available on the menu like pizzas and burgers that I might try next time."}
{"text":"The best I can say is that the food was edible. That's the good part. 

The place caters to paleo and vegan type people, so it's going to be more expensive, but it substantially so. They are a food and smoothie shop with an open kitchen, but do not have enclosed blenders, so there is a huge amount of noise. Also, they do not appear to have run cycles on the blenders, so someone will turn one on, and walk away to do something else, and leave it running. One was left going for 5 minutes non stop. 

The food: to say that it was worth it would be an overstatement. One entree was the shrimp, cous cous and asparagus. For 13 dollars, there were literally 5 shrimp. My cheese steak was greasy to a level that was borderline inedible (It's a cheese steak, so that's par for the course.) The jicama fries tasted like nothing and overall everything was bland and boring.  The food had all of the outward appearances of a place that isn't trying all that hard.  

You can get some veggies and protein there that's about as interesting as a subway salad."}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious food, washed down with tasty juices and smoothies is what I was looking for when I first stepped into Greens and Proteins. And they did not disappoint!

I ordered the turkey and bacon wrap with tofu fries, and I could not believe something this good was really healthy! I was a little hesitant about the tofu fries, but upon first bite this place has me hooked! The wellness drink is great, and I order it every visit. It has the perfect blend of fruits and veggies, getting your daily dose of vitamin needs. 

My only complaint is in the wellness drink. Kale is very good for you and wished they put more than just the few pieces they use. It feels like they use just enough to say that kale is in the drink.

Still love this place and will be here many many times!"}
{"text":"First time here! Menu looks yum but the cashier was hella rude! We will see if the taste of the food can override the rudeness!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I am currently on a strict dieting regiment that requires counting all my nutrient intake and they're always willing to go out of their way for me.  I was helped by Cassie and she was very accommodating in making my order perfect.  Can't complain about anything here."}
{"text":"Love eating here write after working out at LVAC. A quick fix for my protein needs. Gotta step my greens game up though."}
{"text":"This place has a variety of healthy good foods including pizza!! Everything here is good so don't be afraid to order but if you an unhealthy person and don't like health food this is not your place I did say pizza but it ain't no Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"My husband is obsessed with this place, and I do love it too. Every Sunday after church we have to come and I always talk about how I need to give this place a rating! I think we tried just about everything on the menu! We love everything, except for those jicama fries. If they were cooked, I think I'd enjoy them! However, everything else is DELICIOUS. we LOVE it all. Our favorite is the Veggie burger and the Margherita pizza on vegan lavash."}
{"text":"I saw this place by chance when I went to breakfast yesterday nearby, and the name -- and Yelp reviews -- convinced me I had to check it out.  My post-workout lunch today was amazing: I started with the Green Ginger Limeade, and then put together a build-your-own plate of turkey breast, kale, caramelized onions and a side of sweet potato mash.  The meal was lightly but perfectly seasoned; it didn't even need the balsamic reduction sauce (but that was pretty tasty, too).  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Frequent visitor. Friendly staff!! Always bring out-of-town guest here to try the delicious and healthy food! BBQ pizza is the absolute BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"Get their green ginger limeade!!! Amazing!
I can even get my kids to drink it.
Their wellness drink is also very filling"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I got out of m routine of stopping by but will be making it a priority to get healthy in 2014."}
{"text":"While this place is fine and technically proficient, I was not wowed or amazed by my meal, and for the price, I would not come back here again.  I did the make your own meal where you pick a protein, a \"green\", a \"grain\" and a sauce.  The chicken was done well and was juicy, the quinoa was a bit on the al dente side for me, but again was fine, and avocado is avocado.  What I did not care for was how they served it.  It was on a large plate, with everything separate and not touching.  I felt like someone who had OCD fixed the plate.  I would've preferred a bowl where I could mix the things together with the sauce, since quinoa isn't exactly easy to get on a fork with chicken and avocado already on it.  Quinoa is also rather bland by itself.

I also got the Thai Ginger soup, which was more like a thick yellow curry with nothing in it.  I love ginger, and couldn't really taste it in this soup, which was disappointing to me, as it's the reason I ordered it.

I would honestly give this place 2.5 stars, more on the lines of \"meh\" than A-ok, and that's mainly because the service here was decent and the people working behind the counter were nice and helpful.  I would honestly rather go to the Sweet Tomatoes down the street as it's about the same cost depending on what you order."}
{"text":"Fun little place.  As someone that has recently been introduced to juicing, I found this place really cool.  The combination of both a \"juice bar\" which is why I went there and having a lot of traditional food choices fun to salivate to."}
{"text":"Glad they are on South rainbow.  Same menu and half of the time to wait after you order.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of coming in during the lunch rush. It was my intent to treat a colleague with very specific tastes to lunch. When we arrived, the line was twelve people deep, so our assumption was the food was worth the wait.

As we waited we noticed the manager or owner take a person out of line and personally take and expedite her order. At first, I thought he was trying to speed service. The woman in front of us commented, \"if I were in tight spandex maybe I'd skip to the front of the line too.\" Sure enough, the helpful employee did not take anyone else out of line to take their order and stayed chatting with the young woman until her smoothie came.

Meanwhile, my associate noted prices were higher than she really wanted to pay for a smoothie or lunch. Since we were already waiting and the lunch hour was winding away, I reminded her I was treating.

Adventurous, I ordered the ostrich burger with tofu fries. My companion ordered a smoothie and a make your own meal with salmon and rice. By the time we paid, the helpful manager had long since seen his prey leave with her smoothie and was sitting alone at her table on his phone texting or maybe yelping. 

We waited to take our food to go. As we waited, we both cringed hearing the cook at the grill sneezing. This is incidental as I'm sure he was sanitary about the sneeze, but it's still not something you want to hear as your food's being prepared, and it bolstered a so far unsatisfactory experience.

We eventually received our order and rushed back to our office to eat.

My coworker's first comment in the car? \"This smoothie is terrible. I can get a better one a Whole Foods for half the price.\" 

We waited till the office to start in on the rest. My ostrich burger wasn't bad. This was my second ostrich burger ever and it ranked top two. The tofu fries were actually pretty tasty. 

Unfortunately, my coworker's meal wasn't as tasty. Already unhappy with the smoothie she asked me to taste her rice. The rice was still uncooked. The fish on the other hand was overcooked. For the rest of the day all I heard her say was, \"that smoothie was not worth nine dollars\" and \"how hard is it to cook rice?\""}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat, the most healthy and delicious food.  It's open late and the customer service is the best! Always take care of my and know what I want."}
{"text":"I am currently a vegan and thought this place would be a great place to grab a healthy 'juice'. So I come here with my dad and he orders a parfait and I order a green 'juice' and the total comes to about $16 dollars with tip. I thought that was a tad on the expensive side but I know the prices of juice are very expensive because of the amount of vegetables and fruits that go into a juice (I worked at a juice bar for about two years so I understand juice pricing). So my 'juice' comes out and it's a smoothie? I do not know how they can call these smoothies juices?! It was frozen and it was really sweet for something that was considered a green juice. I was very disappointed and felt very mislead. My dad did not like his parfait either (too sugary). As a health nut and a biochemist I would not consider this place to be healthy at all. Albeit I have not tried any other items but i will assure you that I will not be coming back to try anything else. The only time that any one should go sugar load there is after a very High intensity work out. The only reason I have this place two stars is because the service was lovely. 

A note for the greens and proteins owners: 
I would recommend rewording the menu so it is not so misleading. I know you mean well and have a great idea but for people educated on health and wellness it is very misleading."}
{"text":"I stopped at the one on Flamingo for the first time yesterday and took forever to decide what I wanted.  I asked the gal at the counter for suggestions and one of hers was the summer salad.  I ordered a small one with chicken and it was absolutely delicious and very large portion.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy food for the health nuts and macro-conscious!

I'm in Henderson for a business conference but I didn't want to break my healthy eating habits. I love the variety in protein options, the green options without the extra added oils and spices, just simple and delicious! Bonus: complimentary cucumber/lemon water. So good!"}
{"text":"I wish I could do my meal prep like this! Clean quality and taste great. It's worth the price for the quality."}
{"text":"I love going to Greens & Protiens post work out and it's real convienant due to it's location near the N. Decatur LVAC. I love the frittatas, they have vegan options galore and will accommodate you. The staff is always very friendly and the cook will often bring out the food himself. I usually get mine to go, so I haven't had that pleasure yet. The place is clean and good for a meal anytime of day."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The portion sizes were just a little small for the price. I left feeling unsatisfied. 
If your on a diet and don't want to over eat, this is your spot. You will never need a to go box. 
Fellas, if your over 200lbs and aren't trying to lose weight, eat a snack before you come."}
{"text":"It was good my sandwich was tasty and healthy. My wife's gluten free pizza with Low fat cheese was also tasty."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Very healthy.  The staff is top notch, can't think of a friendlier staff.  I wish Las Vegas had more restaurants like this one."}
{"text":"Little pricey, but love their options. If you are going for breakfast, you really should get those Walnut pancakes! They are so good! Smoothies are awesome and organic ingredients! Yep, I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Great service! Great food and even better staff! If your lucky enough to meet Ceasar he will surely put a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"I try to eat very healthy 90% of the times. I lead an active life style and am always looking for good healthy/organic nutritional places to eat. I came across this place and became stoked because it was so close to my house. Yesterday I decided to stop by with my boyfriend; first of all, HOLY EXPENSIVE! I don't mind spending money on food specially if it's good quality but it wasn't. I ordered a Greek pizza w out cheese on a vegan crust and it was so dry! The hummus looked old and I was burping it up two hours later. My boyfriend ordered a chicken wrap (which was not bad according to him) however he felt extremely bloated afterwards. Lastly I had an acai bowl and I was so extremely disappointed, the granola was chewy and old tasting, the fruits were alright but the acai was off in color. It wasn't a rich purple it was more of a raspberry pink. Seriously do not recommend. A myriad of people love it but I just want to share my experience."}
{"text":"Had to dock them one star for my recent order.  I ordered two orders of pancakes and was told they would be ready in 15 minutes.  I waited about 30  minutes. The server even apologized. Also,  when I got home I realized they didn't give us the agave syrup it was supposed to come with.  The house was empty from moving so I didn't have any syrup in the fridge. It's kind of like eating a huge chocolate moist brownie without any milk.  That's just wrong. Next time I'll look at my order before leaving which I should've done instead of grabbing the bag and driving away."}
{"text":"On my way to workout at LVAC I happened to see this restaurant and I happened to be craving a smoothie. After my workout I went in and ordered the Wellness Smoothie. If you enjoy green smoothies, it was delicious! I loved it! Then I saw that there was also bison and ostrich on the menu which are unique menu items. I can't wait to return and try it out!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Been here twice on a Groupon.  The first time the sausage was grotesquely cold, but they took care of it.  Didn't care for the greek scramble or the scrambled egg whites with housemade [cold] turkey sausage.  The berry parfait and Greens & Proteins Breakfast Burrito are good.  The Green Leaf Berry Blast was yummy and not too sweet, just super spendy after the tip. Won't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"YUM!!!

When you walk in..it doesn't look that special. The decor is nice but the menu was deceiving. What I got was MUCH better than I had expected. I had the veggie wrap..and oh my! So delicious and healthy. I had the tofu fries with it.. and i LOVE tofu. They were very light and also did not taste fattening. The staff was very friendly! 

I wish we had a place like this in the North Bay!"}
{"text":"The best place to hit after a workout! So convenient and most importantly AMAZING! I love their wellness drink and the build your own menu. While on contest prep I was able to grab a quick, healthy bite here and they are always willing to customize your order (no added salt, oil, etc.) Everyone is really nice and helpful, but Mariah makes the best drinks in town! She always has a genuine smile, friendly attitude, and seems stress-free---even with a line out the door! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place due to it's glowing reviews from several friends. I saw a Groupon for their breakfast and figured it would be the perfect opportunity. 

We ordered the G&P breakfast burrito, egg whites with sausage, and the whole grain pancakes. The burrito lacked any kind of flavor and was very wet. It was literally laying in a pool of liquid. I didn't try the sausage for the eggs but my stepson didn't care for them at all...once again no flavor.
The pancakes were the best out of the three, but were kind of on the dry side. I didn't mind but my significant other doused them on extra syrup.

I will try this place again, just not for breakfast. Maybe come back around lunch time bc that menu looked great."}
{"text":"Found them through Groupon. 

It's about 5 miles from the Strip but boy is it worth it!

My husband and I both ordered the southwest tofu and soyrizo burrito. Mind you my husband is a full on beefaterian, while I'm a vegetarian. It came with house salsa (amazing), and tofu house fries (bombtastic). The burrito had the right amount of heat but not too overwhelming. I also ordered a strawberry watermelon shake, it was so refreshing. They also offer complimentary cucumber lemon water, we couldn't get enough!

They offer a breakfast and lunch menu. They also have different types of proteins, such as bison and ostrich meat. Another reason to come here is their juices and shakes! 

A must try!"}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place, if you are a vegetarian/vegan or just like clean healthy food you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Been here for a while and I liked it when I first started going but then the customer service just went down. They definitely don't really care to listen for anything else but what you ordered. I think they're understaffed because I always have a wait time when there was only one person in front of me and everyone else in the place got their order. Recently had a take out order and three people behind me got their take out order before me and they ordered more than me. Not sure where their Priorities with orders are. The food is good but it was over priced for what the wait time and average customer service here."}
{"text":"I want to support this place because there are few easy healthy options in the area, but when it takes 15-20 minutes for $5 oatmeal in the morning and are late for work because of it, I can't justify coming back. I don't fully blame the guy working because he might have been understaffed,  but everyone else seemed to get their food on time. Oh well."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I love the healthy atmosphere this place has and how they create such delicious entrees that are good for you! The bison Philly cheese wrap is delicious and the bison burger as well! 

The chocolate peanut butter banana shake is so decadent and it's a little pricey (7.50) but the portion size is huge! So it's definitely worth it. 

The people there are really nice too! They cooked my moms steak well done and she wanted medium rare and so they made her another one and there was no attitude or anything. 

Definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"I would like to thank the wonderful staff at G&P! I have been coming to this location for the last couple of months and today they were even more amazing than ever!

I ordered my normal breakfast to be picked up on my way into the office this morning. Well...that pickup turned into a cancel because I drove right by the exit, yup I didn't even think about exiting (I guess my autopilot kicked in ha!) 

I went ahead and called over to give them the courtesy call that I would not be able to make it and they can do what they please with the food. Becca (I believe her name was) answered the phone and had her supervisor jump on the line. 

Priscilla assured me that it was alright and that they would re-make it when I could come by later in the day, all I needed was to give them a 10-15 minute window. Sure enough, when I called Priscilla answered and she knew right away and said it was no problem and that they would have it ready. I was elated!

I know this a bit lengthy, but I would like to express my gratitude to G&P staff! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Superb customer service and always delicious food!"}
{"text":"I hope the owners are reading this. Please listen to other customers' reviews that discuss poor customer service (ie Latoya & Natalie G). This is one of the reasons we will wean ourselves off of this G&P location. 

I try to eat pretty strict, and every single time I've inquired about ingredients in particular sauces, nobody (except Julie) knows. An employee tried to ask a chef, to which he replied \"we can't share that with customers.\" After approaching him in person, he said he was only following protocol.

So why does the G&P website state \"We also provide an experience for our guests where they can feel free to ask any question about our menu items, recipes or obtain basic nutritional facts to help them on their way to health, happiness and success\"  ?

The employees don't want to learn how to accomplish this. No management, poor work ethic, horrible service...during slower afternoon hours all they do is stand around. They don't take initiative to wipe down tables, ask the few customers inside how their meals are, or clean the drink station.

Julie is the saving grace of this location and should be promoted. God Bless her. She has shown more customer service, more kindness, more motivation and work ethic than anyone else."}
{"text":"Food in general is excellent, even though yes, it is a bit pricy. For this particular location, the employees have always been nice. My only qualm was sometimes they forgot things or for example whenever I'd order \"sautéed kale,\" for the most part, it was never done and came out plain. Other than that, their bison burger and salmon are on point!"}
{"text":"Ok I don't know what I am gonna do when I leave Vegas for the Basketball season! I am going to miss this place! I pre order my drink via phone and I order it do much they know my voice what customer service! RC and my main man Kevin are amazing! My favorite drink is the wellness little grapes, no agave &extra greens! A must try!"}
{"text":"Well thought out restaurant. Amazing, healthy food at a great price for the quality you are getting.  Ostrich burger is fantastic."}
{"text":"Weak to say the least! Nobody knows what's going on! Ask about the H G C diet, they have no clue! Vegan!!! Haha! Cooked on same grill as chicken plus! Wish I could give a negative 5"}
{"text":"The white turkey chili is a party on your pallet. Packed with flavor and delicious pita chips on the side. I highly recommend it! 

As for service, everyone was super nice and helpful. The cashier offered suggestions which I really appreciate being that it was my first visit. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"1.5 star for today. Patrick so unfriendly during my encounter with him while his processing my transaction. It's a first time I got treated like this here. He's tall and I think he's of the manager. He better change that attitude or else customer like me will be so disappointed and stop coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm health conscious, so I'm always looking for a good place to eat out that is still healthy.  Love the juices and I always get a vegan pizza when I'm there.  I guess the only reason I wouldn't give it a full five stars is because it gets too crowded sometimes.  This is probably because it's next to the LVAC."}
{"text":"Clean, bright, and nice. I will return to enjoy the healthy variety. You can chose from many of the menu protein drinks or create your own. This restaurant is a great place to eat that won't give you indigestion or undermine good health."}
{"text":"I asked for angus wrap with out blue cheese and he gave me a phillysteak wrap. I ordered avocado to be added to my meal and he put it on the side.

Only thing that was right about my order was the sweet potato fries. 

Mind you i did not specify it was the cajun angus wrap but when he told my philly angus wrap i told he thats not the one. He stated it was the only angus wrap. I even asked is it the one with blue cheese and he said no. I then stated thats not the one. He was adamant it was the only angus wrap. I said on trusting he would be knowledgeable.

I have now written my wrap down to prevent this."}
{"text":"The smoothies and juices here are fresh, healthy, and tasty! Great for the hot Vegas weather! I go out of my way to come here for their juices...mostly because it seems one of a kind, but also because they're that good! I wouldn't say their tofu fries are healthy, but they're definitely delicious too."}
{"text":"First time here, and I'm impressed by the menu size. They have anything a health-conscious citizen could ever want. Coming from a late night gym session, I stopped by here to please my appetite. I ordered a Bison Cheese Steak. It was fat and juicy enough to make my taste buds dance. It wasn't by no means a tango but more like a waltz, softly making you go hmmm.. that's interesting. Nevertheless it was delicious in its own respect. Tofu fries was great as well. I had a smoothie I can't remember but it was decent. I will return for a second opinion on the other items. I recommend this location to anyone enthusiastic to care enough about this review."}
{"text":"I don't understand the \"portion size\" issue.....First time in , I had the bison cheesesteak wrap with tofu fries....the wrap is huge, actually perfect for having a half of one and saving the other half for later (or sharing)...the salads looked substantial also. Second time in, I had the Greek Pizza on gluten-free thin crust...247 calories...and I seriously do not understand how they do it. It may look smallish; but eat the whole pie...I dare you to tell me that you are still hungry. Great flavor concentration also. I am not into the healthy shake stuff and do not work out at the gym; but \"eating clean\" is a great way to feel better about yourself and the carbs and proteins here are a perfect part of that plan."}
{"text":"Love the unique and clever healthy options-including jicama fries! I wish all the juices weren't blended though, some actually juiced veggies was what I was looking for, not a smoothie. Still we are eager to return and try new stuff!"}
{"text":"What incredible service! All the staff was very friendly and head chef Cesar was most accommodating. 
I came with my entire family and we all left happy and satisfied. The food is well made and great for a healthy alternative when eating out."}
{"text":"The lunch choices are really good and the jicama fries are delish. I dont like the small amount of breakfast items they carry but everything can't be great, right? For the people who are calorie counting, the calories they put on the menu are not very accurate so beware."}
{"text":"Tons of options The food actually tasted like food, which is a lot more than I can say for Rachel's Kitchen. Also the green drink is good, looks weird though"}
{"text":"Love their healthy beast options great value for your money especially after a workout!!!"}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins provided a meal for our crew and cast of 70 on a short film last week.  Our shoot was hard to say the least, it was so hot at least for those of us not from Vegas and we were shooting nights.  Green and Proteins came in and made everything a whole lot better.  So often on set we have the same old meals, over salted and too heavy.  Greens and Proteins gave us plenty of fresh and wholesome food that tasted fabulous and got us through the rest of the night.  I can not recommend them highly enough for you catering needs.  I am a big fan :)"}
{"text":"Food was great, need to have a lesson in customer service. Asking people to leave because it was after closing time was very rude."}
{"text":"Had an issue and yelped about it previously. The owners fixed the problem immediately and were super friendly.  I LOVED the gluten free vegan pizza, hard to find and it was delish. Place was spotless and relaxing. YUM."}
{"text":"If you go get the chicken, asparagus and sweet potato mash it was my first time and I feel great! And Marc was great and very helpful. He gave suggestions and checked back to see how we were doing it was like a sit down restaurant with a less formal feel!"}
{"text":"Love this place love the clean meals right after my gym workouts great service.
Love the smoothies the oatmeal's amazing amazing.
If you're looking for a clean meal for a reasonable price definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Vegan is hard to do. They did it!

Got the veggie burger with seasoned tofu fries. GF got the Cali Chicken wrap. Pumpkin spice tea and Chocolate veggieccino."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but I usually get the wellness drink which is delicious, but a bit pricey. 

I finally tried food. Turkey Burger with Jimica(?) fries.. I was not a fan of those fries they are served cold and the texture reminded me of an apple. 

I went again today and hap the BBQ Chicken pizza and wow! So good. SOOOO GOOD! I want another one! Lol 

I also really like the atmosphere since I am usually finishing a run or workout when I visit I don't always look my best. The staff is always friendly. And there's always others in workout clothes too. I don't feel out of place here. Also an okay place to visit solo"}
{"text":"Hearing so many great things about this place, I decided to check it out for myself. I've never left a bad review in my life until now.  Although the food was great I could only give one star because their staff was terrible.  Being in the service industry, I am really big on customer service.  It took forever for the cashier to acknowledge me because she and another staff member were texting and talking on their cell phones.  Very unprofessional, poor customer service, unfriendly.  I will probably eat there again only because I was pleased with the food, but some of the staff members could use a course or two on customer service."}
{"text":"The service was lovely and the restaurant is clean. Big points there. I've been wanting to try them out for ages because I love tofu and they have tofu fries. What more in life do you need, right? Well...I guess I was just a bit disappointed. I ordered the veggie burger and unfortunately, I was not impressed. If you're a homemade veggie burger fanatic like I am, here are the things that I found lacking. 

1. WAY too thick. It was an inch thick. That with fixings, plus bun = too large!

2. Super dry. I mean, like bad falafel dry (I would say the texture was similar to falafel as well...kind of unusual for a veggie burger).

3. Bland. I could have gotten past #1, and maybe sauced it up to help #2 a little bit, but the lack of flavor made the burger taste like what non-vegetarians think of when they think of vegetarian food. 

It reminded me of vegetarian food from the 80s. We've come a long way since then. Maybe Greens and Proteins didn't get the memo. 

The tofu fries were good. Nothing to write home about, but I would probably buy them again when I'm craving tofu. Oddly enough, the veggie burger at Cheesecake Factory blows this one out of the water. I love supporting local, rather than chains...so I am super bummed. 

BUT...if they ever rethink that veggie burger recipe, I'd be more than happy to give them another shot. The place was clean and everyone was friendly. I'm still rooting for them."}
{"text":"I love the vegan burger and the tofu fries (extra crispy!).  If you tired it when they first opened, it's time to go back.  Everything I have tried recently has been delicious, prices are reasonable (especially considering what you're buying) and the staff is friendly.  It gets pretty busy during lunch, so  I usually call ahead for carry out.  I may have to go back there tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is changing, and not for the better. The prices are the same, but they're cutting back in other ways; $8 for an acai bowl that has less than 8 oz of acai sorbet; which barely tastes like acai anymore. We asked for a kid's burger with sweet potato fries, but they forgot the fries and said it only comes with a fruit cup, yet they forgot that too. Avocado is extra charge...but guess what my chicken wrap was missing. So 2 out of 5 stars for getting 2 of my 5 items correct. This place was great, and I'd hate to watch it go downhill.

The manager did refund me for the acai bowl, and they eventually brought out the fries, twice. But I was already home before I realized the chicken wrap was lacking avocado."}
{"text":"The young man who took my order obviously did NOT know the menu. Told me the small salad was \"huge\" its was actually about the size of a small side salad. It shouldnt take more than 5 minutes to get a smoothie and a small salad with just lettuce and tomatoes and 3 tiny cucumbers. Took 9 minutes and I watched as my drink sat on the counter as 4 people ignored the fact that someone ordered a togo drink. I would NEVER pay 15 dollars for what i got EVER again. Horrible service, small portions for an expensive price."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and ordered an all raw meal. The jicama fries are plain out bad. There is nothing special about them. The raw pizza had an unusually thin crust like a chip and the flavor was not good either. My friend got the nachos and was also not impressed. Hate to give such a thumbs down but gotta be honest."}
{"text":"Great healthy food, has so many GF options and different chains. However it is pretty pricey and a long wait time"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great surprise. Excellent, very creative quick meals. Fresh Ahi Tacos were great."}
{"text":"Love the margharita pizza here!! Will try more dishes next time I go! Maybe after the gym, lol."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Ive tried about half the menu and everything has been superb. The service is fast and friendly as well.  The grilled buffalo chicken strips are the BEST!   The other things I'd recommend are the pizzas (Margerita and Chicken are my fav), the bison burger and the breakfast wrap."}
{"text":"I write this review with tears of gratitude in my eyes. I'm visiting friends in LV for a week, and I'm wicked broken. You think gluten free would be hard, try being gf, dairy, soy, canola, rice, and potato free (amongst others) due to sensitivities. It's rough. 
After carefully reading their menu for about 8 minutes, the wonderful cashier helped me out with a few specifics. I ordered the bison patty with kale and sweet potato mash, and the lump crab and avocado lettuce cups. I watched as they made sure EVERYONE in the kitchen was alerted to the specifics of the ticket, consulted the recipe book just in case, and made sure they had my back as they prepared my food. 
It was all great, clean food. I couldn't ask for more. Thank you so so much. Recommended to every person around."}
{"text":"VERY accommodating. Great customer service! I had a VERY unusual request during today's lunch visit. I had just had my teeth professionally whitened and was told I could not eat any foods or beverages with color, what so ever. Only white or clear foods would be allowed for the next 48 hours. I expressed this \"odd situation\" when it was my turn to order. Next thing I knew Mark (the cashier at the time) and I had concocted an egg white with feta cheese omelet and a side of straight up, plain Jane jicama fries. Though it may not have been the most delicious culinary outtake you have ever heard of, it was a creative and accommodating dish that served up well in my time of need. And it tasted pretty good in the big scheme of things. Thank you again for the great attitude and customer service experience it required to solve my colorless food dilemma."}
{"text":"This place is convenient when you need to choose a restaurant for healthy meal options. I've ordered from Greens and Proteins a few times and was pretty satisfied.. I like that they show what the macros nutrients and calories on their menu. My only suggestion is that they should offer sweet potato fries or something similar to go with their burgers. I tried the jicama \"fries\" and really was disappointed with the texture and taste of them. I would describe them as cold turnips or tasteless apples formed as fries."}
{"text":"Very good food.  I normally get the Bison Cheese steak with a spinach wrap when  I go.  I have also had the Ostrich Burger and a few other things as well.  I have had most of their Juices and Shakes as well.  All of the food has been very good.  

It's always been good service as well."}
{"text":"Bison Burger, side of Sweet Potato fries with a Watermelon /Strawberry Smoothie . We'll be back! Kudos , quite clean in here!"}
{"text":"My favorite healthy place to eat! i love the greek pizza and the green shake is the best smoothie! :)"}
{"text":"really love this place. they have great juices and really awesome options for everyone from the raw diet to the meat diet. Had 1 bad experience here when I ordered a gluten free pizza and they brought me one that was not gluten free and only caught it after I had eaten a slice. The waiter just blew it off as an \"oops\" but for me it is an intolerance not a diet choice so it was not a little \"oops\" to me. I was a bit taken aback by his flippancy. I didn't make a huge thing about it, maybe i should have but i was just disappointed. If you are celiac definitely double and triple check everything...Other than that, i have never had a bad meal there. It is a favorite post yoga and post airport treat"}
{"text":"First time here.  The suggestion for breakfast was spot on.  Love having a healthy option for eating out that also taste great."}
{"text":"For once I was not feeling guilty about eating out. They have a good selection and really live up to their name. 

I had the california chicken wrap and chose a lettuce wrap instead of wheat. The dipping sauce it came with was very good. I do think that the wrap could have been seasoned better. For the side, the choice was between tofu fries and jicama sticks. I chose the tofu fries and quite liked them. Also tasted the jicama a friend had chosen and it was good too.
And their water is infused with cucumber and lemon and is YUM!

Everyone liked their food. I believe the 'wellness' drink was great and tasted amazing.
Everything from salmon to greek pizza looked so healthy and tasted great."}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat.  Plenty of hot chicks that work there, and a lot of tail coming in and out all day.  Way overpriced though.  $8.00 for a smoothie ?"}
{"text":"While attending a  training in the area I fell in love with this place..  I ate there every day ... and later was bring others from the class.  I love organic and healthy choices, juices, smoothies, vegetarian and vegan options.... and this was a perfect place for me. Thank you ."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was in LV on a business trip. Heard about Greens and Proteins, it didn't disappoint. You have to try the bison burger with tofu fries, great combo. Washed it all down with a chocolate peanut butter banana shake. yum!"}
{"text":"Look we all have to eat and in the fasted pace world we live in it is too easy to eat things that are yummy but NOT healthy.  We believe in moderation in all things. A little self control is required!  I promise, you will eat again so keep the splurging to a meal or two a week. Luckily in Vegas there are lots of healthy places to stop and eat and not feel guilty. I mean I can think of 4 or 5 just on Eastern!  Greens and Proteins can fill your stomach with some high quality fuel and make your taste buds jump for joy all while making sure you look good for the pool party season. 

The salads are awesome and you can add really good salmon for a protein boost. The lettuce wraps are always a light healthy meal. Their juices are good but for me I ask them to leave some of the fruit out as I don't want as much sugar.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  You can get in and out quickly for breakfast, lunch or dinner or you can also choose to sit and enjoy a great meal and conversation. I love sitting outside and feeling the wonderful Vegas warmth in the evenings. Enjoy a glass of the complimentary cucumber water that is ice cold and plentiful. 

We all love to eat but we all also want to be healthy and look great. We all like convenience and most of us don't have time or desires to cook three meals a day.  This place can help you live the life you want while eating healthy and enjoying your food. 

Eat to live, but live to experience life.

{"text":"I will never eat here again! The cheese and broccoli soup was very running and hand little flavor. The hummus was worst very bland and no flavor. It tasted like an old rag. The cost was pricy. I get that you are paying for health but it would be far cheaper to buy some chicken , brown rice, and kale, put nothing on it and cook it! This is a fad but an expensive one!"}
{"text":"My brother ordered several pizzas (BBQ chicken and Margerhita) for me and my parents.  After trying these pizzas, I exclaimed, \"Oh my god!! They are sooo good and healthy!!\"  These pizzas have just 300 calories.  For Vegan lovers, this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Acai bowl outside of Acai to the T. I saw that G & P had one on the menu and decided to try it out. 

When the bowl came it was very small and I was surprised to see that instead of an acai berry smoothie mix, it was an acai flavored sorbet with some generic granola and cut up fruit on top. Most places to above and beyond to included honey or agave syrup and some sweet fruit. 

Overall I was just disappointed with this type of take on the bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Fresh, healthy, tasty, and fast. Really enjoyed their selection of craft fountain soda and vegetables. I wish there were more restaurants like this. I ordered the grilled chicken with sauteed broccoli and sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"The food there is unique and pretty true to fact on it's healthy portions and calorie intake I like the location because it's near the gym so if I want a protein drink afterwards that's not from LVAC I can always go there. I do wish they would do something about their AC though the last time the heat was like a little higher then the outside."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in Vegas! So healthy and everything is so full of flavor. Their salads are great and I love the pizza. Loved the acai bowls are to die for. Employees are so friendly and fun. I'm a huge fan of the complimentary fruit infused water."}
{"text":"Vegan review. I ordered the buffalo chicken strips and a smoothie. The strips were tasty, it came with a few strips of carrots and celery; I wasn't a fan of the vegan ranch. The smoothie was good enough. I'd recommend giving it a shot. The girl working register, Kayla, was helpful in informing me about all the vegan options."}
{"text":"Great food.  Pricey, but organic and healthy food is always pricey. Hot girls in this place all the time too"}
{"text":"The food is good for a health food place but customer service is awful. Do not order delivey because they will mess up order."}
{"text":"Super healthy food and very clean restaurant! The bison burger was so good and I did not feel weighted down after eating it. Many veggie and vegan options as well as regular diet to choose from. I am not a fan of jicama but the seasoning on the jicama fries complements it well. I would go back to try to beverages they offer."}
{"text":"I will not be returning due to the terrible customer service I just received. Just spoke with the woman who said she is the to go manager about me being dissatisfied with my order and she proceeded to argue with me rather than just listen and see how she could help me. There was turkey in my salad, I am vegetarian and even called and verified my alterations over the phone - my smoothies were melted by the time I got there and horrible. I will NOT be returning. Terrible terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I selected Greens and Proteins (G&P) because I wanted a tasty, wholesome breakfast with no animal protein.  In short, I was not impressed with this establishment and its offerings. It seems to me that they are offering a watered down version of \"healthy\" food.

EXPERIENCE: I struggled with their juice menu first. I juice and drink fresh juices from other establishments on a regular basis so I felt comfortable picking out a quick juice to start my meal. Unfortunately, agave nectar and honey were featured in all but one drink.   I can get added sugar anywhere in town, I was surprised that a place that calls itself a \"healthy kitchen and juice bar\" offered no pure juices. And that what they were presenting as juice was laden with a sweetener more processed than high fructose syrup (agave). 

Needless to say, I chose the V9 juice since it offered some vegetable and contained no added sugar.  I asked for more greens (spinach and kale) in the juice with regular tomatoes rather than the sun dried tomatoes usually in the drink. The addition of vegetable stock to the juice was confusing for me. I saw them add a processed vegetable broth, not a stock, but that didn't bother me too much. I have never seen a juice offering with vegetable \"stock\", but I was willing to try it.  The \"juice\" was more of a blended concoction.  It was cold and thickish.  Especially as I got the end. What is was not, was tasty.  There was no bite from the lime or garlic and the \"stock\" watered down the taste of the vegetables. The texture and flavor were off putting, but I'd spent the $6.99 for 24 oz. (8oz of that are the vegetable broth) so I drank it. Most of it.

My mother ordered the Greek scramble with a side of the homemade turkey bacon. I ordered the \"Real Deal Oatmeal\" with some of the additions (raisins, bananas, and \"sucant\", which is sugar) on the side. The menu lists \"sucant\" as an ingredient in the oatmeal, but I believe G & P has misspelled the word Sucanat on their menu. Sucanat is a whole, unrefined cane sugar made by \"crushing sugar cane, extracting the juice, heating it, and dehydrating it into granules.\" It's still sugar, but many people consider it a healthier option because it contains less sucrose and \"retains the natural molasses and trace nutrients like iron, calcium, potassium, and B vitamins.\"

I've ordered oatmeal at dozens of establishments in this town--most not presenting the image of a health conscious establishment---and I've never heard what I heard from G&P.  After ordering, the cashier had to come over and find me to tell me that they could not put the sugar (Sucanat) on the side.  \"Why\" I asked. She explained that the sugar is mixed in with the oatmeal. What??? I clarified in case I had misheard her.  I asked incredulously, \"The sugar is already mixed in with the oatmeal? So I can't get oatmeal without sugar?\" Correct.  She informed me that they pre-mix the sugar in the oatmeal.  To put this issue in context, a person can order rolled oats oatmeal at McDonald's without sugar.  How do they know how much sugar (Sucanat) I want in my oatmeal?   I imagine they err on the side of \"a lot.\" 

All of the other breakfast options included animal protein or sugar except for the Berry Parfait. I ordered it without the strawberry yogurt since I assumed that it had more sugar than I would like. I asked for plain yogurt in the parfait. The chef happened to be out on the floor and the cashier (misunderstanding my request?) asked the chef what was in the strawberry yogurt. He stated that it was plain yogurt with strawberries and sweeteners added.  I don't eat pre-sweetened yogurt and figured the strawberries and sweetened granola would add enough sugar to the meal. He said they had plain yogurt in the back and that they could accommodate me. 

The parfait was fine--lots of large strawberries and sweet crunchy granola.  I tasted one of Mom's tofu fries and it was crunchy and well seasoned. She enjoyed her egg white scramble and turkey sausage side.

I understand everyone visiting G & P will not share my expectations. If people are looking for a place with some vegetables and some healthier options, this place is solid.  I love that they have a raw section on their menu. I also appreciate the lean meats on their menu that are not easy to find elsewhere: bison and ostrich. 

SERVICE: Great service. They did a fantastic job of accommodating me.

SUMMARY: Greens and Proteins seems a decent option for those on a plant-based diet looking for restaurant options, those seeking non-certified gluten free options,  or those looking for more generally healthy food options. 

It was not a good place for me. When I patronize a \"healthy\" establishment, I am seeking whole foods, less refined sugars and grains, great taste, few if any processed foods, and greater raw (and cooked) vegetable options. I do not think I will return to Greens and Proteins."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place!  Just moved to LV and was looking for some healthy dining experiences.  Me and a friend both ordered the bison burger in a lettuce wrap with tofu fries and I also ordered a Green Ginger limeaid.  The green drink showed up quick and was sooooo good!  A+ and about 10ish minutes later our food arrived....The burgers had the bun on them instead of the lettuce wrap but the waiter was really great and brought the lettuce out promptly!  The burger was delicious!  There was some sort of yummy sauce that came with it too.  The tofu fries were ok...they weren't hot :(  probably would have been great if they were hot, but I ate them anyways bc they were still good.  Next time I will order the jicama fries.  Cant wait to come back to G & P and try everything else out!"}
{"text":"We tried Greens & Proteins again and was really impressed with the service and food quality... I can see why it's a favorite of so many people... The food was fresh & healthy and the juice was fresh pressed. So happy they have menus you can look at rather than having them taped to the counter like they used to be... Will definitely be enjoying this again soon!"}
{"text":"I had the wellness juice and the turkey wrap and was surprised at how delicious it was! Very flavorful appetizing and delicious, but healthy as well. A win win!"}
{"text":"If you want cheap , go somewhere else . If you want to eat clean and bomb food at that , this is the spot . So far everything I had here is awesome"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Perfect spot to get a healthy meal after working out at LVAC. Their juices and smoothies are great and I love their breakfast. A bit overpriced thus the minus one star but other than that my new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Very friendly and efficient staff. Very fresh, healthy and proportioned menu with lots of choices for all diets."}
{"text":"First visit to Greens & Proteins, so glad Julie was there! She introduced me to the menu and recommended the tri tip tacos! OMG, the best. Also let me taste one of the juices, so refreshing! Thanks Julie for a great experience! I will be back...soon!"}
{"text":"Lots of vegan and gluten free options.  The veggie burger didn't have vegan mayo as advertised, but was tasty anyway.  Decent service."}
{"text":"Healthy doesn't have to be Bland.....


Greens and Proteins is just waiting to explode into locations all over the place.  It is as marketable as a snow day when you're ten, and healthier than a visit to the gym (with less no-neck tools grunting too)

The interior is serene and beautiful, with waterfalls on the walls, grass-green accents around the room, and a few big screens; Greens and Proteins is a smoothie made of Whitman's Leaves of Grass poetry, modern chic, and conscious eating.  

Trying to stay on your diet plan for that summer body?  The items on the menu have their calorie count posted, so you can tell just how many miles it would take to burn off lunch.  If you don't care about that sort of thing, the food is still quite delicious.

I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken wrap w/ jicama \"fries,\"  and a smoothie that had pretty much everything in the garden in it.  I can't recall the name, but it was green and wonderful.  


I live pretty far from here, but luckily the nice woman at the register told me that a new location could be opening in Summerlin sometime soon.  In the meantime, I'll make the trek for something nourishing, tasty, and satisfying, it's certainly worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great place to have healthy food the best egg whites turkey sausage with goat cheese on the eggs and half avocado and green ice tea services also great"}
{"text":"First experience and last. Most painful order experience. I asked what the restaurant was about. The girl couldn't and answer me just stared blankly. I asked her what the * meant next to lean angus burger and she had no idea what I was taking about. I should have turned and walked out and gone to the other protein place across the parking lot. I then asked about the Salads and then portion size. I made sizes with my hands. Again a blank stare. It was pulling teeth to get anything out of her. I will never go back again because of that experience. She was clueless, lazy, and did not want to work. I'm in sales and I work for my money. I expect others to as well."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Food is awesome and they alter items easily to fit dietary restrictions. 
Cute and clean inside. Friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I come here twice a week and every time I walk in the employees are very rude in taking my order.  They seem to be talking in the back before coming to take my order or texting on there phones. Also all the tables are very nasty and disgusting and one time it was so nasty I got up and left . Food on the floor and tables and dirty water cups. This place want see me again in the future. Rude customer service and it's nasty from the eating area to the bathrooms. Who would want to come eat and the tables and floors are disgusting . This place needs to learn to treat people with some respect and learn to clean there establishment!!! Disgusting"}
{"text":"My partner & I are from out of town & we both watch what we eat. This place is AHMAZING due to the fact that they have the amount of protein, fats & carbs per menu item written alongside the descriptions! It's a dream come true for people who log their food in diet apps such as MyFitnessPal. I wish we could get a place like this in Australia :(

We didn't have ANY issues with the speed of the service or the quality of the food. Very very bloody delicious"}
{"text":"5 Stars - Staff was very friendly and accommodating.

5 Stars - Veggie Quinoa burger was great. Do not like buns, so they put it in a spinach wrap for me. Had Jicama fries on the side (raw with seasoning sprinkled on) and those were great.

5 Stars - Thai Ginger Soup was very good.

1 Star - Chicken Satay was horrible. The chicken was so tough that I could not eat it and actually had to return it the next day (as I had already taken my food home and was not close by)

I would def return to this place as they have lots of wonderful choices but I think I would eat the food there, in case there were any issues. 

Parking is not all that easy around this place, you may have to find a place and walk a bit to get here but it is nice to have this type of healthy food available to us."}
{"text":"Great Healthy food very trendy atmosphere lots of beautiful women in gym clothes and great service. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is it's pretty expensive"}
{"text":"Since Greens and Proteins opened, the gf and i eat here at least once every other week.  It's one of several dining options within walking distance of LVAC and it's definitely our fav especially when we are faking it trying to eat nutritiously.  About the only thing we haven't tried are the various smoothies, shakes, veggie blends, etc.

Our fav item on the menu is the make your own meal - a protein, a veggie and a starch with a sauce.  The cost ranges from $9 to about $18.  I generally go for the pork loin or turkey ( the cheaper selections ) with the veggie choice of either mushroom, asparagus or spinach and the brown rice with the pesto sauce.  they have about 8 choices in each category.


Also like the tofu fries, the chicken fingers and the caesar salad.  The pizzas are also decent but suggest you ask them to make the crust crisp since at times i felt the crust was \" limp\"

Good service and they have a several flat screen TV's for sports watching."}
{"text":"Food is great!!!  Service was fast. I have been to G&P over five times now. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and the service is always friendly! I have a ridiculous amount of food allergies to watch for, and they're always willing to check labels for me or answer any questions. I like the build your own meal option, but it can be a little pricey depending on what you order. Usually, I order the Angus burger wrapped in lettuce with vegan cheese. Comes out to about $12 with tax, which is reasonable considering the quality of the beef. Also, I love being able to use those substitutes!! The only bummer is the sides they have to choose from ..no soy allowed, so I can't  have tofu fries, and the jicama fries taste like raw potato to me.  Only other option is a vegetable, but honestly? Broccoli with a burger isn't the best. Still giving them a good rating because of the staff, though. Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"I am forever on the hunt for a fast casual restaurant with healthy food that can rival those on the East Coast. Greens and Proteins was the next stop on my list.

I ordered the Caesar Salad. I know it wasn't a particularly exciting choice, but I can't say I want any tofu fries...

The salad was just okay. The dressing was super light and lacked a lot of flavor. I wish there had been more. I liked the addition of the Parmesan.

Overall, this was not a salad worth the price. I'll go elsewhere. Maybe, some of the other food is better. I'd be willing to try something else.

The service is quick and friendly enough. Overall, it's a decent place if you need something fast and healthy."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit and I Was very happy with my meal.  I got the G&P breakfast burrito.  I'm still new to the healtier eating lifestyle.  Initially the taste was not as rich as a normal burrito, but I liked that I wasnt eating 2000 val in the burrito. I put a little salt and burrito tasted great. I am definitely going back."}

{"text":"Best healthy fast food in Vegas! I only wish there was one by my work so I could have if for every meal!!"}
{"text":"Perfect post-workout nutrition to fuel your body right after a hard training session. They have a wide variety of healthy options including anything from a hearty protein shake, grilled chicken salad or even a gluten-free vegan pizza which lately has been my absolute favorite. 


+ Conveniently located within walking distance to the gym
+ Large variety of options, so there's something for everyone
+ They have gluten-free vegan options 
+ Outdoor seating patio options 

- I typically go when it's busy so there's usually a wait
- A little pricey. My friend and I ordered a gluten-free vegan pizza with a large rough-cut roma salad (no meat) to split and it was about $30 - yikes!  

Overall, yes I would definitely recommend this place as I go here at least once a week. Their wellness green drink is super refreshing and as I mentioned before I'm a fan of their gluten-free vegan pizza; however, you can't really go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"Love this Place!!! I have been going here for about two years but just recently started posting here again. Their food and drinks are GREAT.A huge variety, nice service, good location, but can be a little crowded at times. The prices are a little high too as it will cost about 50.00 for two. They offer delicious protein shakes and you can have them ADD things such as blue berries, celery etc...
I like the Turkey burger and tofu fries. Check it out and I am sure you will go back over and over."}
{"text":"After a morning of errands I was starving...but also sick of eating heavy processed food! A quick yelp research lead me to this place. 

We really liked this place overall. Love the fact that the company has lots of meatless options and healthy earth conscious meats.

We got three smoothies and drinks 
1. Tofu and banana split (no agave can't stand it) 5/5
2. Wellness drink so good, green with a hint of nirmeg 5/5
3. Green-leaf berry blast. Not that good weird off flavors all 3 of us tried and didn't like it 2/5
4. G&p breakfast burrito-delicious with turkey and home fries made of tofu 5/5"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with this place. Great way to eat out and eat healthy. The staff is attentive and personable. The food always comes out amazing. Very fresh, flavorful and completely healthy. I eat here almost every meal. Lol  I can't stay away. Like I said I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"Love this place, eat here at least once a week. Bison Cheese Steak and Chicken Sausage Pizza are amazing. Just got the Bison Burger. Sooo good. Healthy food that tastes good is hard to find and they are definitely the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Healthy food. Slightly on the pricier end. Food is bland. I built my own mean. Bison patty, quinoa, and avacado with walnut pesto sauce on the side. I liked the under salted patty, but I eat a low salt diet. Most folks will taste the difference. Quinoa was over saturated, as in totally soggy and tasted like tap water. I got one of the protein cookies on a whim. I'd skip the prepackaged baked goods."}
{"text":"I love this place. Especially the angus burger with tofu fries and the bbq chicken pizza. Delicious everytime."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab breakfast. The wellness juice is delicious. The customer service was awesome and I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I Love Greens and Proteins. The wellness drink is the best! Everything is so good and super healthy for you. Great place to hit after the gym!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place so even after a bad first experience, I came back for a second try.  The concept is good- we need places that serve good food.  But what i had was not very good.  First time i had the tuna salad and it was exceptionally small and dry - just did not taste good.  The second time i came i had a Coffee-Chocolate-Veggie Shake (720 calories) and mediocre with a LARGE chicken Cesar salad: small quantity limp romaine lettuce, some stale tortilla chip broken up, a little bit parmesan cheese thrown on the bottom --- the dressing was like a flavored mayonnaise on the side.  Really weird taste on the tortilla chips almost like cheetos and the rest was dry.  The chicken itself, while not grilled, as at least passable.  Not the sterling experience I had hoped for."}
{"text":"Everything thing I've tried here has been delicious... The greek scramble, french toast, bison wrap, & now the turkey club with avocado added to it. It's all delicious this place should be on every corner around the city."}
{"text":"I'm always happy when I can find gluten free food. They have healthy food and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is just on the basis of the madness of how they made an $8 smoothie: they added a heap of ice, which, you know is basically just filler. Then they ended up making too much, filled my cup and dumped the extra --- all of those wonderful fruits and vegetables --- down the sink. So frustrating to pay nearly ten bucks for some diluted smoothie, the rest of which is wasted, flowing down the drain."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian or vegan, this probably isn't a post you'll want to read... because this place has made me fall in love with bison! Referred to as America's \"original red meat,\" bison (or buffalo) is not only richer in flavor compared to cow beef, but it has lower saturated fat & is a great source of nutrients (zinc, niacin, iron, B6, selenium, etc). What is this -- a sales pitch to eat bison or a review for Greens & Proteins? Lol, seriously though. I'm hyped on this!

FOR HER: 
- I ordered the BISON BURGER ($10.99). Grilled bison meat with low-fat cheese, lettuce, tomatoes & onions. Very tender, I ordered medium well & on a whole wheat bun. For $1.00 more, you can add two strips of turkey bacon (which complimented well!) and for $0.75, you can add avocado. Also comes with your choice of fries, I tried the TOFU FRIES -- which are 6 thick strips of fried tofu (not a fan of tofu at all, but these were surprisingly good!) that comes with a dipping sauce & a pickle. 
FOR HIM:
- He ordered the BISON CHEESE STEAK ($10.99). On a wheat hoagie bun topped with red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce & tomato. He also opted for the tofu fries (he actually is the one who recommended them to me to begin with). A generous amount of meat, lots of flavor & very filling! Instead of bread, you can also choose to have on savoy cabbage, wheat wrap, spinach wrap or a whole wheat bun -- but I think the hoagie gives it that necessary cheese steak vibe you need!

Prices are reasonable for what you get. If you're expecting dollar menu prices, you belong at a fast food joint then. Always been a fan of Greens & Proteins, but it was a long literal 20 mile drive from home -- so to have this location open up only 2 miles away is extremely exciting for us! Located near the new LVAC on 215 & north decatur, I imagine this place doing well since that is such a big up & coming area right now... and we definitely WILL be back often! :)

PRO TIP: As of 5/7/16, there is a Groupon for 12$ worth of food for only $6! GET ON IT NOW!"}
{"text":"I liked this place! Just don't get the cold \"fries\" that start with a J...

I live really close and thought it was part of the supplement store that is next door, but as I was driving to Del Taco I noticed it was a cafe.

The food tastes great for the most part, the service was superb and the place was very clean. I didn't see too many people there, probably because it is so new and people don't know about it. I got a smoothie as well that was really good! The downside is that it is more expensive than going to most other fast food places, and the wait is a little long. I suggest the sweet potato fries and the ostrich burger."}
{"text":"Obviously a healthy place to eat but jeeeeeeez -us, like waiting for dial up internet connection waiting on the food"}
{"text":"I am in Vegas weekly for work, and I struggle to not visit Greens and Proteins multiple times during each trip. It's amazing, the food is great, fresh and after eating I always feel satisfied, not grossly full. If you are looking for a quick, easy and amazing meal when in the desert, get here."}
{"text":"This spot was just OK for me. I am hoping it was just what I ordered, which seemed a little bland. Maybe I really had a hankering for something savory at the time - just trying to give them the benefit of the doubt!

The restaurant was definitely clean and service was friendly. Although it was lunchtime during a weekday and it was busy, I thought they were serving customers in an efficient way. 

I will be happy to give them another chance and update my rating as necessary but for now... meh!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Finding a healthy spot w/ good food at a reasonable price is tough to find at times. Def check this place out if you're having the same problem I've had in search of healthy tasty food. I got my breakfast & lunch fix today here, that's how good it is.

Breakfast - real deal oatmeal (Irish steel cut oats, flax, cinnamon, sucant, & almond milk w/ bananas & raisins (335 cal)) - a good healthy portion of it. They don't skimp here. Even included half of a sliced banana

Lunch - Wellness drink (Green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed, agave (286 cal)) - Very tasty & refreshing
California Grilled Chicken (Turkey bacon, L,T,O, and extra virgin mayo (494 cal)) - the meat was tender & every bite was just as good as the last.

For their wraps they do offer a spinach wrap as an alternative. In additional you can just between a few options of fries.

They have quite the selection & the best part is you can order breakfast or lunch at anytime."}
{"text":"My husband came here and picked up some food for us to go. He ordered me the California Grilled Chicken Wrap with tofu fries. He got the Bison burger with the raw jicama fries (I think that's what they were?). Mine was so yummy and that was the first time I ever tried tofu fries. They were seasoned so well. The wrap was delicious as well. It was a little bit dry but overall it had great flavor. 

My husband's bison burger was probably the best thing out of both of ours. It was so yummy and juicy. I wish I got his burger instead, lol. I wasn't a fan of the raw jicama fries. They had a good seasoning on them but I did not care for them. 

I cannot comment on how the service was or what the decor looked like because he took it to go. We will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place to eat healthy for breakfast lunch or dinner. Smoothies are a little pricey but otherwise everything else is amazing."}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast. Burrito was pretty good but asked for a side of fruit and they gave me literally the smallest side of fruit. Not even enough for a kid. Guess times are tough."}
{"text":"Quick and healthy! My kind of place.
So far I liked everything I've ordered.
Favorite thing on the menu- Bison on spinach wrap.
Super healthy, super yummy!

Easy order, easy pick up on the way to work or football practice."}
{"text":"The staff couldn't be sweeter and in a better mood. From the busser/food runner to the register people they're all good at what they do. The outside seating is always nice too. Great place!"}
{"text":"Im updating to 5 stars because they have added to the menu and in all the times I have been there (alot) they have not disappointed. Kudos here. And they just opened a new location at Rainbow & 215, which is great for me. 

I love this place, the food is great for healthy living. Quality is great and ppl are nice, the owner does his best for his customers. I am absolutely addicted to the wellness drink. The reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because its a lil pricey for what you get and i wish they had more variety on the menu and daily specials. Perhaps they could use an executive chef that puts a bit more flavor in the mix."}
{"text":"Cool easy vibe. 
Fast, fresh food.
AC forever on blast. 

Favorites (in no particular order)...
Acai Bowl
Chichen Quinoa Salad
Vegetable Fritatta (comes with watermelon/feta salad. sounds weird, tastes great!)
Ahi Tostadas

Bring my laptop? No problem.
Fill my giant hydroflask? No problem.
No pressure.
No drama.
Employees: Pleasant, thorough and concise.
Eat and go. Eat and chill. 
Consistent."}
{"text":"Very vegan friendly! Whole foods! Clean eating! Healthy! Raw options. Great service. Great food."}
{"text":"Had big exceptions on this place because I've heard a lot of good of it. When my wrap came it was watery, no taste at all. I couldn't be more disappointed, my teriyaki chicken didn't even have a flavor.. so unfortunate."}
{"text":"AMAZING. And I'm far from a health nut (I like to pretend I am sometimes.)

Sometimes you just want something that's gonna make you FEEL good during and after you eat/drink it without sacrificing taste entirely. 

I had the green shake and it's incredibly tasty!

I think I've found my first spot to stake residency in. 

YUM!"}
{"text":"So I've been here about 5 times now and every single time it is GREAT! THE STAFF IS ALWAYS SO HELPFUL! The chef Caesar makes excellent food and even comes out sometimes to make sure everything is tasting good. The options are so healthy and there is something for every eating plan. I always stop here after my workouts and even bring home food for my bf who isn't dieting and he loves it too. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"great vegan breakfast burrito.  great juices.  I used a groupon here.  Lady at register was very friendly.  I enjoy these style restaurants more than traditional sit down.  Pay up front and they still bring it to you.  little bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"The title on the front: \"Healthy Kitchen\", that alone should be the warning. If a business has to advertise that, they are trying too hard.

Maybe we have high standards because we are from California where we know what good, clean Vegan food actually is. When we walked in the manager/server (?) jumped up and said \"Hello, Welcome\", then went back to leaning over the front counter with his phone in his face. Everything seemed okay while ordering at the counter. The realization that I was in a gross place started when I went to pour water. Tap water from the Coke machine. What \"health\" oriented  business has anything to do with the Coca-Cola company (FYI: corrupt evil corporation). Any truly healthful food restaurant knows what clean/pure water is. Not this place.

When my Veggie Burger arrived the GF bun was SO DRY and starchy it was like eating stale duck feed. And it's not just my bun, my husband had a standard wheat bun with his veggie burger. I went to the sidebar to check out the condiments like ketchup and mustard: SYSCO. If the basic condiments are SYSCO with high fructose corn syrup, just imagine the rest of the ingredients in the kitchen, and their source. Some of the reviews here say \"I'm glad they use high-quality ingredients\", that is not possible if their main supplier is SYSCO. We asked for another ketchup or condiment option that did not have High Fructose Corn Syrup from the server/mangaer. He said that was all they had. Lame.
The Veggie patty was bland beans. The Tofu \"fries\" were so fried there was no tofu left in the middle, shriveled and soaking in oil. Gross.
The Thai ginger soup I got was like a think gloppy pudding. I tried putting it on my burger like a condiment to make it more edible. Didn't help. 
My son got the GF Veggie pizza, the only thing flavorful on the table, because it was drenched in oil. 
If you have HEALTH standards, are Vegan or Gluten-Free, I would NOT recommend this place. It is a cheap chain, with rip-off prices. 
Unfortunately, we left half of our food on the plate uneaten, walked out highly disappointed and feeling sick and gross from the quality of food."}
{"text":"I'm trying to eat & they are painting the restaurant during dining hours! Nothing like the fumes & scent of paint in a health food restaurant."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served here. Each of these meals are healthy, clean, and tasty. The prices are not cheap but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Very healthy,  get your Greens and your pic of protein.   Lots of choices, beef,  chicken,  ahi tuna, tofu. Sandwiches ,  salads,  smoothies, and your fill of complementary Cucumber water."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant. The veggie burger and sweet potato fries are great. You'll get full from earring at this restaurant. The customer service is also excellent."}
{"text":"This place has really great veggie options but also have different meat options as well. I enjoy their green smoothies. The only downfall is that you have to pay for parking unless there's a place to park that I don't know about. For my green cravings, this is where I go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My favorite place in vegas. The wellness drink is a must have! If you want to eat healthy but not sacrifice flavor!"}
{"text":"Love that you can build your own meal! I had grilled turkey breast, spaghetti squash, and avocado, with lemon vinaigrette. It was great! 
I shared the summer berry salad (per the guy behind the counters recommendation) with my boyfriend (without the cheese), and it was delicious!
We also shared a green smoothie, and it was fantastic!
My boyfriend ordered the bison burger with jicama \"fries.\" He said it was wonderful!
I tried the jicama fries (jicama and cayenne powder) and they were good!
Overall great stop on our road trip! We got our food quickly and the staff were friendly! I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place offers something for everyone, but it is especially vegetarian heaven in a city where meaty buffets run supreme! Or it's a perfect if you are feeling guilty after a few days of indulging. I was in Vegas on business and found this place a few miles from where I was staying. Now, I would say not to come here if you are ravenous because the portions are just right to be filling, but definitely aren't huge. The menu is a mixture of smoothies, juices, burgers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and custom plates. I got a custom plate with tofu, asparagus, spaghetti squash, and peanut sauce. It was pretty good and the price was reasonable. They don't flavor the vegetables at all and put the sauce on the side, so you are free to do what you want. On the plate, it looks kind of small but I left with a full, happy belly! And the employees were super friendly,  which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"A coworker recommended this place to me so I decided to give it a try today, definitely worth the trip! Had a small rough cut with chicken, yummy! Perfect size, too! Will be a normal lunch spot from now on. Try it, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"CAME IN FOR THE ~V9 (carrot,celery,sun dried tomato,scallions,cabbage,garlic,yellow squash,zucchini,orange,lime and vegetable stock=279 cal) The place was clean friendly folks working here and helpful! My juice was tasty and very earthy in flavor and not bad! Hey If you want a break from juicing at home come here hangout you can pick the strong wifi from the Starbucks next door... also they have 3 big screen TV's! The place is very chill...."}
{"text":"WOW......this place has an incredible menu !   Unique items not found anywhere else!    A little on the pricey side, but not when you realize how healthy the eats are !  I decided it was well worth the money !  I am now totally addicted to their ginger lime-aid -- like nothing I have ever had !!!   Totally addicted for good !"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken quinoa salad. I can't believe the calorie count they cite because this salad was AMAZING and too big to finish! So many things on this menu looked fantastic. I was craving a salad after work and wanted something quick and easy but also high quality. This place exceeded all expectations. The salad was one of best ever, parking and access was easy even during rush hour, and the wait was less than ten minutes."}
{"text":"Turkey burger with sweet potato fries at least once a week! We've tried a few other items, and all were good too. Service is always quick and employees are always smiling :)"}
{"text":"Get the Protein Pancakes! I split them. They're delicious but make you full, so I get one order to share and my own smoothie or juice. Order ahead!! They're packed."}
{"text":"Tasty food and great customer service from all the crew! This will be my go to spot for lunch now"}
{"text":"Great food! Okay prices.Food is fresh and delicious! Great for when I need a break from cooking! No cheating on my diet there!  They have everything you need!"}
{"text":"Good food. Mediocre service. I go here pretty frequently because I work about three minutes away.. 
Last night I ordered a bison Burger cooked medium rare and an acai sorbet bowl.  The Burger was cooked perfectly medium rare and my acai bowl was fully packed - Everything proportionate to each other. I prefer to get my acai bowl here because unlike everywhere else, I can eat my bowl with everything and I'm not left with a whole bunch of the acai mix on the bottom without any toppings. However, I got my acai bowl again this morning around 7:30am, once I got to work, only half of my Togo cup filled, half of the granola I got from the night before, and only couple of pieces of each fruit was on top. Their consistency with the portions are not always the same."}
{"text":"I ordered a broccoli and cheddar soup today and it was horrible. My stomach instantly got upset by the soup and it wasn't tasty at all. And to top it off they only gave me three chips with a big cup I'm so disappointed in what I purchased today. I feel like it was absolute waste of my money."}
{"text":"The best! I love eating there and the staff is super helpful if I need to change something in my order a bit! They are also very educated on the Menu and are able to give you explanation for all things!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm over the crappy service here. Been on the G&P wagon for years. This is very high priced \"healthy food\". I get the concept and I'm ok paying the extra money for quality and service. But they just simply do not staff enough people. We know you are a profitable business (New locations opening). Spend the money and staff your restaurant. 40 min wait for simple wraps is stupid. This happens to me on a weekly basis. I owe a business right down the street and will no longer allow any of my staff to eat here because the wait time is too much. Ive given too many chances to fix the issues including internal complaints to management. You might as well go sit down for a nice leSurely meal at Archis next door at the price and wait time it cost to eat here. No more G&P. I'm sorry but I've had enough...."}
{"text":"This place has done such a good job with my groups! They are always on top of it! The food selection is so vast-from Raw Vegan food to a Grass Fed choice Felit for less than $20!! The wellness juice drink is a great way for me start the day love it!"}
{"text":"Greens & Proteins has my Favorite #Vegan #Burger made from #Scratch #Organic #NON-GMO ingredients! Very clean restaurant great staff very friendly, they've added new menu items, #ProteinBowls, #Streettacos. Great concept!"}
{"text":"Love G&P-they offer so many choices, they have great juices! The food is full service quality at fast casual prices!! They even have spaghetti squash!! Love the #vegan options!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not my favorite & the prices are a bit on the high side for the amount of food you get. Taste wasn't exceptional either but the smoothie was delish, although at almost $8, I'll just make my own food & make my own smoothie. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I was completely ignored, as the staff talked to themselves, so I gave them a couple minutes while I stood there. Eventually, I left and went to another business. Normally I would give a new business the benefit of the doubt, but I was the only customer there and didn't even get a friendly hello. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Took my kid here . First the good news . I ordered steak tacos . Delicious!!! Now the bad news . I was asked if I wanted to ' add ' avocado, I said yes . I never saw avocado so ........?  My kid had one of the wraps and did not enjoy it . 
When you enter a restaurant I believe you should not complain about pricing. So just be forewarned that two people could enter for a casual lunch and walk out having spent close to $ 40 .00 . 
But I will finish by saying the staff were polite and helpful. My food was delicious and everyone has their own taste so someone could enjoy the wrap my son ate . And I DO recommend to try this restaurant. I will be bringing my kid back to try different items ."}
{"text":"Ordered acai bowl and this really a joke!!
See my photos you will realize that you are paying for nothing! It cost 8$ for less the 3 slices of strawberry 1 blue berry and 4-5 slices of bananas!!
It's not even organic ! Why $8???!? The acai is sorbet and not real 100% acai- you can tell because the sorbet is sweet so they added sweetener into it,
If you ever tested real acai fruit you probably know that's it's not sweet.
Literally there is nothing here that worth more then a $1.50!!!
Beside that I don't understand what is all about how all the items in the menu can be healthy if they NOT ORGANIC?!!?!?"}
{"text":"Love this place, staff is amazing and they always give great suggestions for new drinks."}
{"text":"This location needs to go get customer service training from the Rainbow location. The service at this location from the self proclaimed supervisor is so sub-par, although the server who delivered our food was very nice. The lettuce in the Caesar salad had hints of green but was mostly white. Charging $2 to substitute cucumber slices for pita bread is very irresponsible & counterproductive for a \"healthy\" restaurant. I will only be going to the Rainbow location from now on."}
{"text":"I admit I've probably driven past this place a billion times but finally paid attention to it when I was on Groupon and saw they had a $12 for $6 deal and had to try it. Came in during lunch time and it wasn't too busy. I was told I had to make sure I spent at least $12 for the Groupon deal so I went ahead and ordered an Acai Smoothie which wasn't amazing compared to other Acai smoothies I've ordered but still drink worthy. For a meal I ordered the Turkey Burger with Jicama Fries as I've never had Jicama before and well, the turkey burger was excellent but Jicama, I am NOT a fan of you and should have gone with the Tofu instead. There was a little bit of a wait especially in between my smoothie and meal, like I literally was almost done with my smoothie by the time my food was ready but all staff members had a smile on their face, very friendly and even with some slow service I still got in and out of there in a decent amount of time during the lunch hour. I'll definitely be back to try more especially as they serve healthy menu items for a fair price compared to others!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for healthy eating options, and post workout refueling! Pizzas are delisH on lavash crust. I've also had the breakfast burrito and burgers which are also yummo! Love the atmosphere,  staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Hard to find a good spot for healthy food in this part of Vegas. Everything was very fresh. Great smoothie / juice bar. Excellent staff! Went 3x in a 2 day span after finding it."}
{"text":"Eating while on the go in just a nightmare that I try to avoid. Eating at Greens and Proteins however is a breeze! I don't struggle to find food that won't hurt me and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Came here one day for lunch with a friend (actually come to think of it, it was before the Brooklyn Bowl event) XD 

Margherita Pizza (Low-fat mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted garlic, and basil) - To my surprise, i didn't know there was roasted garlic in this. If anything, all i noticed was the huge amount of mozzarella cheese on the pizza. They have different crusts you can pick. thin pizza crust (normal), lavash (a persian? flat bread?), and something else. Not sure what lavash was or the other one (and this was my friends pizza anyway but i was ordering/paying) so i decided to get the normal thin pizza crust. Flavor overall, like a normal margherita pizza. Only thing was i hope they can amp up the roasted garlic flavor (or maybe i can request for more/additional roasted garlic... XD garlic lover om nom nom) and the crust, maybe they can bake it longer. It was a little soft for my taste. The edge crust, it was nice and crispy, but anything under the toppings, was a little, floppy =X

Bison Cheese Steak Wrap (Red onions, peppers, low-fat mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato) - this order was for me. I thought it was quite interesting and ive never had bison before. something new to try for me. Comes with either a side of tofu fries or jicama fries and a pickle. The pickle was a normal pickle spear (yum). I opted for the tofu fries (curious but definitely not a stranger to tofu). Nicely fried. A little underseasoned but still tasted yummy (i like tofu anyway). As for the wrap, you get a choice of either a savoy cabbage wrap, wheat wrap, spinach wrap, or whole wheat bun. I opted for the spinach wrap. Overall, it looked decent and yummy. While i ate it, it was dripping a lot of juices/oil. Almost made it seem like this wrap was heavier/fattier than it really was. First experience in trying bison? uhm if i wasnt told it was bison, id almost call it beef. Overall, flavored well but a bit messy to eat (drippy drippy ....) Im not sure how healthy this wrap was but after eating it, i didnt feel so healthy. LOL  

Overall, nice place. A bit on the pricey side. These two items added up to i believe around $24? I guess a price to pay for fresh/organic? ingredients. May try other things next time since i think i picked the fattiest item on the menu."}
{"text":"If you want awful disgusting food, then this is the place to go.  We ordered the raw nachos, lettuce wraps, hummus, soup, and raw pizza. Not a single thing was appetizing. It all tasted like last weeks left overs.  

The food was over priced and our order was botched.  We asked for no avocado...food had avocado, asked for no olives....food had olives. Ordered the tortilla soup....but instead got this goo which i think was the thai ginger soup.  

Final word for my experience:  gross"}
{"text":"First time customer. As soon as I walked in it was busy. I was greeted by a friendly cashier and she help me order. Especially asking if I wanted avocado like she read my mind. I ended up ordering up the buffalo wrap which I devoured once I arrived home. Everything fresh. Good customer service and such an upbeat atmosphere. I will go here again."}
{"text":"Great food,  unbelievable salads.  A little pricey for what you get,  but any health food fanatic will be found eating their.  Not only does the food look and taste great the patrons are lookers too."}
{"text":"Been here only 3 times and I love it. I love eating here and not feeling guilty! Everything here is fresh and (organic I'm assuming) but def healthy! They put the calories and macros right on the menu to help u choose. My personal favorite so far is the California Grilled Chicken wrap! I order it with tofu fries (which I had for the first time here at this restaurant) and the combination is delicious!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy restaurant that is also delicious? Greens and proteins is where you want to be. They have delicious pizza and their bison cheese steak is the best thing to me."}
{"text":"I am somewhat of a fitness enthusiast so I was looking for a place that sold healthy food and drinks. I came across Greens and Proteins while driving along eastern avenue. Now I'm used to cooking and making my own healthy greens and protein foods, so I have a bit higher standard for places like this. First of all, they are relatively expensive but this is understandable considering the healthy ingredients which tend to be natural or organic. 

My friend ordered one of the actual meals while I ordered one of the green drinks, I believe it was the one with chocolate flavor. Anyways, my drink tasted horrible. Maybe it was too healthy but I couldn't swallow it. If you are into this type of thing, maybe its for you. My friend ordered something I believe with the eggs and it was ok.

The environment is very nice. When we went the place was booming so I have no complaints there. The staff is friendly and it gives off a healthy, clean, fitness vibe. I think you just have to be into this type of food. It's a different taste which I don't like but many health buffs will like. Maybe I will try a different food so I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I will update this review once I try something different and will take pictures of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Another Green's and Proteins!

I usually get a grilled veggie wrap and tofu fries. Actually I try to try something different each time I visit a location. 

Got a berry smoothie today and can say that this location put out the same quality as the other two locations I have been to.

G&P's favors opening locations by LVAC's and this is no exception. Right at N. Decatur and Rice.

Anyway I'm usually not in this area but ran an errand this morning and popped in for a custom smoothie and am happy the quality is staying consistent.

These places are not Go Raw but they always put out a fast and healthy choice when needed :)

Happy to see another location and good luck!"}
{"text":"I respect the hell out of any proprietor that wants to improve their business. After having the owners contact me I decided to give it another try and met the GF for lunch.

This time around it was by far a much more pleasant experience.  Upon making entry we were greeted and offered to have the menu explained to us.  I went with buffalo burger wrapped in lettuce. I ordered up a side of jicama fries, which I discovered I really did not care for. I really enjoyed the GF's tofu fries. For a beverage I chose carrot juice with a bunch of other ingredients  added to it.  Surprisingly, I was full all day and very much on a nutrient buzz.

Sure it's a tad on the pricey side but so is just about everything else out there and this is healthy for you."}
{"text":"I did wait a while for my food however the employees were very sincere for the wait, they kept coming and apologizing. The food was definitely worth the wait though I enjoyed their protein pancakes very much (:"}
{"text":"\"Healthy Food\" is such a trend so I feel most places just make anything healthy and it'll be popular. The food is very bland, the hummus is horrible. So dry and flavorless please avoid. The chicken satay is yummy \"the peanut sauce\" on it is healthy and good. As for everything else I don't think healthy has to mean lacking flavor, and spice. This place is alright wouldn't recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  Been here to many times to count and never leave un happy.  Wellness drink and veg burger are my go to's.  Light and refreshing! Enough said!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is my new favorite place!! I can't get over how fresh and amazing the food is at an extremely reasonable price for being MADE TO ORDER!! Yes, it takes some time, but it's more than worth the wait. I've had the chicken wrap and the build your own plate with chicken, edamame, and sweet mash!! Wow so good!!! After consuming both of these meals, I enjoyed the berry parfait....  It was pure heaven!! I have a hard time believing it was only 185 calories because it was so god darn delicious.  The next day all I was craving was the place. That is a great sign of a great establishment. Kiddos to you and the staff! Speaking of staff, Savannah is so friendly and patient when taking my order. What a great person to have greeting the customers and interacting with them! Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" place when I'm looking for a quick, healthy meal. I've been here for breakfast (totally hooked on their frittatas), lunch (love the bison burger on butter lettuce) and dinner tonight for the salmon.  I love that I can build my own plate that allows me to eat Paleo. Tonight's meal did not disappoint.... And now I'm hooked on their sweet potato mash!!"}
{"text":"What I love: The Veggie wrap on spinach with tofu fries and a banana tofu smoothie. I have been squeezing in a trip to this location after yoga and it is perfect every time. This is a meal that is enjoyable without fail time and time again. If money grew on trees I would probably eat here every day."}
{"text":"Food is good cashier is really nice great service nice hospitality menu very healthy worth every dime you spend"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD, DRINKS, and the FRIENDLIEST STAFF. My new place to go right after a hard workout and to stay healthy and fit"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes are what I get every visit. So delicious! Management must be really good because out of all locations I've visited, never had anything other than fun, happy, and professional dealings with employees!"}
{"text":"Quick smoothie instead of a meal.  Gets the job done.  $7.50 for 255 calories.  Kinda pricey but convenient.  Service is quick and staff is knowledgable.  Grilled Buffalo chicken strips. Excellent and just the right amount of spice.   

Breakfast is the best thing they do here in my opinion.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Where can I start?  We used to live in Vegas and our BIGGEST complaint over that 3 year period was always the same thing... There are 0 healthy/organic/clean food options in Vegas off the strip!  So, as it goes, within 1 month of moving back to Miami, G&P opens their first location, lol.  
1.  BOTH locations are super clean, great seatin in&outside
2.  Breakfast options at all good, healthy but not boring
3. Lunch options are just as awesome, the quality of their products shines through in all their dishes. Very unique! 
4.  Lastly is the star of the show... The JUICES!! OMG! Seriously, I'm not even a juice guy, but they make them so different and enjoyable, you don't even know it's healthy.  The wellness that everyone raves about is all that.... 7 or 8 diff green fruits & leafy's with a touch of agave and your Good to go!

Way to go G&P!  You hit the nail on the head.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This by far my FAVORITE place to eat! I had lost around 189lbs a year or so ago before moving to Vegas and finding a HEALTHY restaurant that does not cost fortunes prices difficult. This place is the exception!!! The food is a REALLY good quality and the atmosphere is fresh/inviting! The best of all is the prices are not astronomical which for clean eating is extremely hard to find. I will certainly be coming back here soon and look forward to trying everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"great food, great smoothies, I would also recommend breakfast there...tofu served like country potatoes is quite taste.  Only does side would be the prices. $$$"}
{"text":"Giving them 3 stars simply because finding a healthy option in Vegas is nearly impossible. However, maybe it's me but does get by mean bland? If so then I guess this place is good??? Atmosphere in restaurant was nice and their drink selection was decent, but the food itself was wholly miserable. It took FOREVER for the food to come out, not sure if they cool everything to order or what. Also the processes astronomical. For 3 ppl two wraps a meal and 3 drinks it was $54. Say WHAT??????  Would honestly never go back but my husband's a health nut and after a week of binging in Vegas I reckon he'll drag me back to this place."}
{"text":"So seriously, why is everyone so obsessed with this place? I get it's healthy and nutritious, blah blah but it's overpriced and the food itself is just meh. But maybe I'm the one with weird taste bc I do enjoy me some Protein House and I get sad that Protein House is only in Henderson. 

I've tried different things at Greens from their juices, to the burgers, to the fake pizza, spaghetti squash, and everything was simply not memorable. The only good thing, that I actually enjoy eating, is probably the tofu fries. Those deserve 4 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great options. Food wasn't fantastic, I built my own and husband got the bison wrap. The sweet potato fries were the star, we are hoping to try other items next time."}
{"text":"Awkward service. Weird vibe. Made me feel very uncomfortable to linger.  Decent food, certainly, but massively overpriced...and bland (tofu fries; veggie frittata). Unfortunate that this place just can't meet expectations after having been there several times, given that I live in the building."}
{"text":"Service awful. Young muscle head cashier never said hello, never smiled, never thanked me after tipping him cash. He served me my ostrich burger it is was dried out completely and the sweet potato fries were stone cold. Took forever to get it in the first place. Not even busy. Just think they were lazy and not really paying attention. Will never eat here again. It used to be much better when it first opened up several years ago. Now it just sucks! They could do without the attitude for sure!"}
{"text":"First time at this location. The dining area seems a lot more spacious and clean than the location on 215/eastern. There was only one couple that ordered ahead of us (and maybe only one other group of people who already had food) in the restaurant. The food took ~20 minutes to come out! I NEVER waited that long at the other location and it was much busier. The food was really good but wait time ruined it, might as well go to a full service restaurant. The build your own meal is the way to go, the sauce options are awesome - especially the pesto! It is pricey but \"healthier\" than most."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Loved that I could go and pick my own food. It was so good and so healthy! Absolutely will come back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm new in town and found this place next to the gym. Asked the pretty lady working there what she recommended. I ordered the bison cheesesteak after a work out. Wow. Couldn't finish it although I gave it my all. The tofu fries were something else. Take out service was speedy. We need more places like Greens and Proteins."}
{"text":"A great spot to grab lunch/dinner with your friends who are looking for healthy options. I've been here twice and really enjoyed it. First time I ordered the bison cheese steak and the second time I ordered the bison burger. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. Their tofu fries reminded me of a tofu dish you can get at any Chinese restaurants, which I really liked. They serve cucumber water and often walk around with smoothie samples for customers to try. Their customer service is excellent and I will be back to try their other options such as salads and create-your-own-meal dishes!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  Kept it simple and ordered a turkey burger with avocado and opted for the tofu fries. My coworker ordered the veggie burger with gluten free bun and jicama fries.
       The food was decent, nothing spectacular, nothing terrible. 

The staff was very kind and courteous. 

Bottom line....  Nice healthy eats with a premium price attached."}
{"text":"This place is hugely popular with people leaving the gym next door. It has a huge healthy menu and I tried the salmon with avocado and quinoa. $12. Pretty good but pricy I thought. Hard as a first timer to read and figure out their menu. Not enough pictures. Looks like lots of other things to try."}
{"text":"I go in here specifically for MANBAKE bars which are so so good! I love the double chocolate and cookie dough! They have a bunch of flavors right at the register when you walk in. Make sure you check the expiration date because they are all different ;)"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times since it opened. Today is the last tho. It's happens to me three times now so I don't know why I'm surprised but I ordered egg whites and sausage and also protein pancakes. Turkey sausage was raw and like jello when I chewed it so I immediately spit it out and go to eat the pancakes and they are still batter inside. Smh. Like I said last time I ever eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in at 9:40 after a long flight. We expected to be rushed since they closed at ten, but the customer service was on point. The food was amazing, and they were incredibly welcoming. There was no rushing at all. We were still out by ten, but the fact that they didn't shoot attitude or rush us was a pleasant surprise. We will definitely be back. 

**i highly recommend the bison cheesesteak - it's awesome!"}
{"text":"***If the owner or manager is reading this, I'd like to know how you can prevent this unpleasant experience from happening again in the future.***

This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have EVER encountered before. 

I called Greens and Proteins about a month ago, to see if they could take a reservation for a large party of about 15-20 people. My team was planning an outing in the area, so I thought it would be a great idea for a healthy lunch. The girl I spoke with checked with her manager, who said it wouldn't be a problem, and to call back closer to the date.

A fellow team mate of mine called and spoke with the manager a few days in advance, who confirmed the date, time, and number of people. 

I called the morning of the event, and spoke with Elizabeth. She was totally unprofessional in both her tone and handling of the situation. She put me on hold to check with a manager, and came back to tell me there would be no guarantee that they could accommodate us. The time we would be visiting was a busy time, and she stated that they could not promise to reserve tables for us. So I asked if we could be seated at separate tables, to which she repeated her original statement: she could not promise us that we could be accommodated. This was extremely frustrating, as we were told in advance that we could make reservations, and it would NOT be an issue, and now I had a team of 18 people with out a place to eat.

My fellow team mate that originally made the reservations called, and spoke with a different girl this time - and she had no record of the reservation made under her name, days before. The girl assured us that she would have the manager call us back, but we never received a phone call. This resulted in us having to find a different place to go to, an hour before our event was supposed to occur. 

Why would management originally say YES, you can take a reservation for a large party, only to go back on your word, and put myself and my team in a difficult situation. We were told that our reservations were set, and when the day came, no one had any idea of what we were talking about. WHY would you make promises that you cannot keep? That is a huge customer service no-no.

As for Elizabeth, she was had NO empathy, did not offer ANY solutions for me, and was so unprofessional. Customer service is the most important aspect of a business. For this reason alone, I will not be back again."}
{"text":"great green smoothie(forgot the name)
ok chicken quinoa salad (special) needed some flavor kinda bland but looked healthy
will come again"}
{"text":"well deserved 5 star, healthy menu, easy to read, great prices, food is served to order, so it is fresh, friendly staff and super clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good.  I had the albacore tuna salad and the white turkey chili, both of which added together are less than 600 calories and both are insanely good.  I will definitely be back the food and service rocks!"}
{"text":"You might think that a $15 meal would be given to you hot. That was not the case for my last visit just a few minutes ago. I ordered my food on line and the app said it would be ready at 12:36. I arrived at 12:34 and picked up my meal. When I opened it and began eating it the Angus wrap and sweet potato  fries were stone cold as if th ed y had been sitting a while. Not happy and It will hinder any decision to return."}
{"text":"I love to see what people can do in the health food/vegan food industry and I've been blessed to try a lot of establishments that take the idea that healthy food can be delicious to the next level! That being said, I really wanted to love Greens and Proteins, but after ordering from them twice I'm feeling pretty lukewarm about them. Heres why.

The roasted vegetable wrap: Ok, good assortment of veggies in here but VERY VERY greasy. So greasy that it was inedible the next day. Even though it has some pesto in there it REALLY lacks flavor. I think they need to pair it with some kind of creamy dipping sauce, put some seasoning on those veggies, and for the love of god: tone down the oil! Then it would be perfect.

Hummus platter: Very unimpressive and tastes unusual? The hummus was very gritty and dry and has a flavor unlike any hummus I've had before (and I've had a lot of hummus!). A decent hummus is extremely easy to make so I'm really not sure what happened here *shrug*

Fries: Their options are tofu fries, jicama fries, and sweet potato fries for extra $. I'm sorry, but the only sensible option here seems to be the sweet potato fries. I could be wrong but the other two options just sounded bizarre. So I ordered the sweet potato fries twice. The first time I just tossed them out because they were so bland and under cooked. However, the second time somebody in the kitchen wisened up and crisped those guys up and added a bit of salt. Ate the whole thing! Yum.

Ahi Tuna Salad: I got without the hard boiled egg. Probably the best thing I ordered. Pretty straightforward. Kudos.

Wellness Juice: Excellent. I love the large size, flavor, and it was definitely fresh!

So yeah, being that I have a lot of dietary restrictions I was pretty much limited to only a few items + plus the juices/smoothies. Which is fine, as long as they are delicious and prepared correctly. Clearly there need to be some improvements! I hope Greens and Proteins reads this!"}
{"text":"This place was very cute and the food was delicious, I ordered the tortilla soup which was a bit too rich for me but it was filling. I'm glad we stopped in on our long drive back home."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is like a cafe sit down area with open windows. Choose between a large selection of healthy breakast items , lunch or dinner. I went at breakfast loved the greek scramble, a bit bummed on just black coffee no creamer or substitute for creamer but they have a nice selection of special caffeine and non caffeine drinks. My husband got the burrito and enjoyed it with a peanut butter bananna smoothie shocker he couldent taste the kale or spinach in it thats a bonus for him. My daughter enjoyed a turkey burger. Overall great food will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love their smoothies but I swear every time I come here it takes 20 minutes for them to make me ONE"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place often and then received amazing customer service, however my most recent experience was one of the worst customer service I have ever received. I ordered a burger for pick up on April 8th around 4pm. As I picked it up I asked to get it cut it in half because I was on the go and wasn't sure if I would have a knife. I then heard the cook in the back say in a rude tone \"she can't do that herself? She can just open her mouth wide...\" I found this very offensive especially at the fact I can clearly hear her. Very sad that one of my favorite places quickly became one of the worst."}
{"text":"Amazing place to come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I love their menu and fast service."}
{"text":"Very fresh, great menu selection and variety. A little pricey but worth it. Good customer service."}
{"text":"We had two shakes from there and they were pretty good. I'm happy with my purchase and I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Concept is good, quality is good, but not good enough to give more stars. Particularly for the price I would expect something better.

To be fair, I only tried their smoothies, so I might have a different opinion when I have other items."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy breakfast since I have been feeling under the weather. Turns out this is the perfect place with the perfect drinks. I highly recommend the Wellness Drink"}
{"text":"It was a good experience. The tofu fries are surprisingly good and the food is wholesome, but it didn't really blow us away. Customer service was friendly."}
{"text":"This location will never get my money again. First off the customer service I received today from the young lady at the cashier was so unprofessional. From the time you walk into a place of business/ restaurant. The individual at that front counter will be the person who sets the tone. 

The protein pancakes I received were nothing like the pancakes I received before. I didn't even bother eating them on top of the fact that I was already displeased when I walked in. So I ask for a refund & this same young lady that I first encountered at the cashier. Decides to practically throw my money in my hand. As if it wasn't enough that she was rude from the moment I walked in. 

Great food chain, but when you have someone like this young lady working at the front counter. Who knows nothing about good customer service. That type of attitude will definitely drive customers away."}
{"text":"This was a good salad that I enjoyed. The lettuce was fresh and nice size helping since its hard to fill up on lettuce I got some chicken as well. The chicken was decent and I think I'd go back against for another salad but I don't think I'd get the same thing. Gotta switch it up and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"This place is located near my house so it is a  plus having a place you can grab \"fast food\" when you're not feeling like cooking, and not having to worry about plaque building up in your arteries as you are consuming your oh so delicious lard. 

The place is located in a very high traffic plaza and it can get pretty packed during lunch. Inside of the restaurant is very well done. The interior has a very sleek, modern and clean look. The menu is fairly simple, and the calories are added next to each item on the menu (major bonus). The staff was fairly friendly albeit a bit rushed even though it was not very busy on that particular day. 

I opted for the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken wrap with a side of Jicama fries. Everything was very delicious.  The less calories conscious boyfriend opted for Turkey BLT wrap with tofu fries. The wrap was just ok. It needed some sort of a light sauce or marinade  to infuse the exceedingly dry turkey. This would be a forgivable,  if this wrap was not $10.99. He ended up finishing my wrap of which he was a huge fan. I absolutely LOVED the tofu fries. SO good! The lunch was not cheap, but that is expected at a place that serves healthier options, and by nature of the business incur higher direct and indirect costs. Also, by choosing this particular location to open shop, the business has found its niche. Let's hope for the best. I will be back for sure, just not sure when or how frequently."}
{"text":"Review 6/4/17: This used to be my go-to establishment for smoothies. I'll chalk today up to short-staffed. They're now adding ice to the smoothies ... I don't remember them doing this before. The drink was watery with chunks of ice left in. The person taking our orders totally blew it with one ... leaving out the peanuts and honey. I'll go back, but be more careful about ordering.

Review 11/4/17: We've tried a few more times since my last review (which somehow never got posted). They've changed menus several times (with price increases accordingly). Today we ordered 2 more smoothies specifying \"no ice\" and \"no honey\". They were both so sicky-sweet we had to trash them after a few sips. Apparently (and confirmed by the server), the sugar comes from the \"chocolate chips). Really? They used to include Stevia, honey, and the banana as the sugar sources. My conclusion is they switched to a cheaper sweetened chocolate. Sigh! Another establishment starts up with ideals and slips into mediocrity as economic reality sets in (I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that profit margins are not the drivers here)."}
{"text":"This is SOO good. It's their vegan Impossible Burger Cheesesteak...I've had it 3 times this week! I want to try some other things off their 'make it Vegan' menu but this is so good I keep ordering it lol anyways I love the variety for vegetarians and vegans they offer and my omnivore husband can come here too. Love this place! I ate the other half before I had a chance to take a pic"}
{"text":"If you want to eat healty - quickly and at a resonable price, this place is great. It's self service and the decor is nothing special, but it provides exactly what the names says."}
{"text":"Great place to go for healthy drinks and food. I tried the wellness drink and the vegan pizza and both were great. The place is a little pricey, but way worth it."}
{"text":"I greatly love this place wonderful food and I love the drinks all that stuff but for the price is super hard here I love them but I I can eat all I can eat Shabu or sushi for the price for just a smoothie and food there I think they should come out with combo meals one day so I can enjoy them more."}
{"text":"Extremely happy they are finally on this side of town! I was able to go the other day and got the G & P breakfast burrito with tofu fries and it was amazing! I also love the banana split smoothie! So much flavor and extremely heathy!!"}
{"text":"love this place! great healthy food. breakfast burrito is amazing here. :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. Don't waste your time it's too expensive and they don't deliver on the food descriptions.They should  stick to smoothies."}
{"text":"Today is Monday, March 21, 2016 and I have NEVER left a yelp review positive or NEGATIVE however, the chain events that I went through at this one Greens and Proteins I felt compelled to. I called from the parking lot, using my bluetooth, to place a to-go order, I was at the Lifetime fitness on Charleston and just finished my workout (11:45 am). Immediately I was asked if it was okay to put me on a brief hold. I was on hold for over 10 minutes, and by the time they picked up again I was standing right in front of the cashier. She seem annoyed at ME, which is ridiculous because it should be the other way around, and she said, \"our phones are not working properly.\" I placed my tuna salad and chicken quinoa salad and the cashier said in a condescending tone, \"well at least you do not have to wait long for your order because you are ordering salads.\" $19.00 + dollars and on top of it I tipped them 2.00 (which I should have not had I known what other crap I had to endure). Had it not been for the Seven magazine I was reading to occupy my time, I realized 15 minutes had passed and those who ordered after me were already eating or have left. I looked into the kitchen and the two cashiers were talking and \"looking busy.\" I see my salad order just sitting on the counter in the kitchen. I loudly say, \"Is that my salad order I have been waiting for?\" They looked at me as if I am the one being rude and look at the order like it appeared there magically. Since my husband had already had lunch he said he would eat the quinoa salad for dinner. I just got a call from him at 7:30 pm and he said there was GLASS in his salad. I called to inform this location what we had been through. Of course it is not the evening shifts fault and Priscilla, the supervisor I spoke to apologized and offered to buy us new meals but that is not what I want because I am NEVER going to this place again. The Greens and Proteins on Rainbow is closer to me and I usually go there. This was my second and LAST time going to the Flamingo location. If you decide to patronize this venue, be aware and cautious."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a bit pricey. However, the food is fresh and tastes wonderful. I only review places I have been to at least a few times...and I have had a good experience at G&P every time I went. The Wellness drink with protein always makse my body feel wonderful. I drink it after I workout on days I feel a bit under the weather, and it always makes me feel much better. The Ostrich burger they have is so good and low calorie as well."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a clean meal that's actually delicious, this is the spot for you! I would definitely recommend Greens and Proteins to my Real Estate clients!"}
{"text":"This my jam.

This is one of my favorite spots in my area. 

The juices are awesome and creative. They taste great. They aren't cheap (7 bucks or so), but at least you get fresh ingredients. That's what counts right?

Food is quite good too. The Bison cheesesteak is delicious. So are all of the flatbreads.

Most Vegas locals know about this spot, but if you are unfamiliar, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in North Las Vegas! I love everything here so much that I order atleast once a week!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The first time I found something on my burger and when I told the manager he took care of me. I appreciated the good customer service. Their pizza is good and so is the angus burger. Smoothies are healthy and a nice size, but overall the food is expensive. I'm ok with paying for good quality if the ingredients are healthy, just can't come here too often. I appreciate them showing the calorie count!!"}
{"text":"I love Greens and Proteins. There are so many delicious healthy options. I have eaten at this location twice, and neither times was it is good as the food at their n Eastern location (tofu fries were way over seasoned and they forgot my sauce that goes with it). I also do not like the layout/vibes of this one as much. The staff was very friendly though. With so few healthy options compared to fast food chains it is great to see places like greens and proteins spreading. Overall, this is a nice place to grab a healthy bite."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bison Burger to go. Definitely an interesting healthy menu I'd like to come try again, especially the Ostrich Burger, even though it's pretty heavy on your wallet, $14.99. But I heard ostrich is pricey.

Jicama fries that comes with the burgers are very interesting. Not french fries, far from it. It's more like seasoned radish slices. That's definitely a healthy substitute... definitely not as yummy as french fries. A+ for effort, though. Many items for people who are on that HCG diet, too.

Free Wi-Fi inside and the decor is very modern and hip. The place looked very clean and orderly. There were lots of take-out orders going out, so lots of people seem to like this place. Always a good sign...

I'll definitely come back here. I think you get a check-in discount on their smoothies, so I'll come back for those and more healthy eats!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day and did a \"create your own\" meal.. I got the bison patty, whole wheat pasta, and sautéed spinach. My girlfriend got the ahi tuna, edamame, and quinoa. Both meals were very good, and we left feeling full and good about ourselves. Definitely can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great when you want to eat out, but still want to eat right! Just went with some clients and I'm sure happy we decided to go here. The tofu fries are a great choice, but anyting in thus menu is great. Make sure to try one of their green drinks!!"}
{"text":"Always clean restaurant and their food is amazing! A lot of different options and everything I have tried is good! Their staff is friendly as well and there is tons of seating! The bison cheesesteak wrap with sweet potato fries is my fave!"}
{"text":"This place was great,good healthy food,fast drrvice,everything was very clean,l will keep going back"}
{"text":"I always love Greens and Proteins except for the times, like today, when I am missing half of my order (ordered through Postmates so I couldn't check myself). I wouldn't mind if it was cheaper food, but for the fact that this is more expensive than other options and to still not receive what I ordered is annoying and I paid for something I didn't receive. Just some advice for Greens and Proteins, double check orders before checkout so someone isn't leaving a bad yelp review."}
{"text":"Greens and Protein is the place.  Looking for healthy food? You gotta check this place out. I've lost almost 25 lbs since they opened the downtown facility.  The staff is always cheerful and positive and eager to please you. The restaurant has a uniqie vibe to it; if I ever walk in in a bad mood I always walk out in a good mood.    If everybody ate here they would put shrinks out of business.   Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"This place is the best place in Vegas for living a healthy lifestyle. Food is great and customer service awesome"}
{"text":"The best place to eat clean in Las Vegas. I wish there was a location in Los Angeles... My favorite part is that they cater to HCG dieters. \"Awesome sauce!\""}
{"text":"When we arrived we were second in line. We ordered a wrap, 2 wellness drinks and a child's pasta. Our drinks came out fast but it was over a half hour for our food. The food was ok but they messed up our order, we were charged 1.50 for avocado that they forgot to put in the wrap. Overall the food was good but overpriced. Their smoothies are $8-$10 and service is slow. 

The girl who took our order was rude and very short with us. Sad to say it this will be my last trip here."}
{"text":"Wellness drink is the BEST!!!!!! I haven't had much food here, except for the hummus, salad and wellness drink. Everything was absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for awhile.  They rock!  If your unhappy about something tell management and they will bend over backwards to make you happy.  Highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good meal that is healthy."}
{"text":"Visited on Aug.20 at 7:45pm. I've been a customer for 3 yrs & never before had a negative experience however last night was a disappointment! I have laryngitis otherwise I would have requested a do over in the store. The lady that took my order for a green ginger limeade was wearing plastic gloves that she handled my money with. I then witnessed her sweeping the floor with the same gloves on & then delivering a meal with the same gloves. That customer sent his meal back for more rice. She made my drink with the same gloves on & I think she was having a rough night as my drink was devoid of any ginger or lime & was watered down. Just as I got my drink another customer came back in to complain & have their green ginger limeade remade as it was waterey. Please have your employees change their gloves as the above is very unhygienic. I should have also asked for a redo on my drink."}
{"text":"Food here is good the buffalo chicken pizza and the bison philly are my two favorites. I really don't need to explain why this place is soooo good just go and try for your self you won't be disappointed. But seriously the bison Philly was almost if not just as good as a Philadelphia Philly"}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly Great place to eat healthy.  The staff is friendly! It's a clean place bonus for me. You can sit outside as well."}
{"text":"Great place to get an after workout juice or smoothie!  You all are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been looking for a new spot to eat healthy at and I found it. Ir had the create your own with chicken, brown rice, broccoli ad get the lemon vinaigrette dressing and put it all over everything. Love that dressing, seriously wish they would bottle it and let me take it home! I've also had the veggie pizza and chef salad here too which are both really good and light. All in all this place is phenomenal and all the staff are really nice!"}
{"text":"Inside the place is nice and colorful, makes you feel fresh. The menu is a little steep but reasonable for being healthy. I ordered the bison wrap and tortilla soup. The wrap was amazing. Not sure if the soup was even what I ordered. Just seemed like a cream of something, no chunks of anything in it. The taste was fine, but I don't think it was what I ordered. The complimentary \"cucumber lemon\" water was way too cucumber-y and there was absolutely zero lemon in it. False advertising. If the soup was right and the water was more to what I expected this would have made five stars. I will go back again to try other wraps and their burgers. A great healthy alternative."}
{"text":"Greens and proteins is a decent restaurant with healthy offerings but at the end of the day, there's not enough offerings and variety for us to be regulars.  

I ordered the angus burger with lettuce pocket (instead of bun) with tofu fries.  Angus burger was fine, not salty which is good.  The tofu fries were salty because of the seasoning.  So healthwise, its kind of a wash with the tofu fries lol.

My wife ordered the build your own with angus patty, kale, and sweet potato mash.  She seemed to enjoy it because the kale was steamed and not sodium bombed.  She also ordered a ginger limeade which was too sweet for her taste.

The price was surprisingly high as all the above came out to 35 bucks (with tip).  So although we feel the food is relatively healthy, the price and distance from our home is a small obstacle for consistent repeat business.."}
{"text":"The cool thing about this location is that is open till 10pm for all those healthy late snack meals.

They have bison burgers, and other cool healthy foods. 

The place is open and has outdoor seating. 

They can accommodate any meal plan and if you call ahead they can have it waiting for you. 

All the cool vibe of a hip food restaurant without the guilt."}
{"text":"This is the place if you are getting fit and still want a place to feel like a restaurant. 

They cover several meal plans like Paleo, HGC, Vegetarian, bla bla they even have ala cart so you can pick your poison or health kick :) 

There is calorie information listed so you can plan your meal accordingly. 

But even if your not in a diet or meal plan, they got a cool diverse menu."}
{"text":"I enjoyed proteins and greens. I ordered the wellness drink and hummus. The drink was delicious!!! The hummus was decent, served with pita bread and chips. 

What a great spot for a healthy drink, snack or meal. Staff was very nice!!"}
{"text":"I had a large lunch order for work that I had to deliver by 11:30 and the Downtown Greens and Proteins totally took care of me.  It was ready on-time, each item was labeled with the person's name, so no one had to wonder who got what, and they helped me haul it all to my car.  Great experience, looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Update on my last review. The owner Patrick replied to my review and invited me back in to make it right and discuss my visit. He was super nice and knowledgeable! The employees were really nice this time around! Food and smoothies  tasted awesome and super healthy for you! My son and I each had the build your own with chicken and broccoli and he got rice and I got quinoa. He had teriyaki sauce and I had 1 teriyaki
1 spicy peanut and 1 pesto. They were all great!
My daughter being a teenager had the buffalo chicken lol! She enjoyed it! Me & my son split the juice called the Malibu breeze it was yummy & full of nutritious things our body needs! Great experience this time around! We will be back! Patrick is awesome! If only all business owners could work there business all day lol!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time this weekend one word YUM! ordered the protein pancakes came with fresh banana slices and pecan slices in top oh and agave syrup on the side A PERFECT 10! Not to mention large portions. Hubby had the burger with turkey bacon and sweet potato fries and ordered the little one a pizza and BOY was it big two kids could have eaten from it. $30 for the meal but Groupon has a coupon you can purchase now so jump on it! Lastly the service was fantastic and both the restaurant and bathrooms were squeaky clean!"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing.. The burgers, shakes, wraps.. Everything! I love the quality of the food, it's always fresh, the staff is always friendly and happy."}
{"text":"The food was great but the staff were a little lacking in personality and engagement."}
{"text":"I checked this place out a few days ago.  Ample seating and an outdoor sitting area-dogs welcome.  They have a wide selection and I chose to make my meal. You select a protein, vegetable, and carb.  I went with the chicken breast, asparagus, and mashed sweet potatoes (a little less than.  Everything tastes so good!  The chicken was sliced, juicy and well seasoned.  The asparagus was great dipped in the lemon vinaigrette I selected and of course the mashed sweet potatoes were good!  Seemed a bit pricy or the meal but that is what you will get if you are striving for grass-fed antibiotic free meat."}
{"text":"THis has been on my list for a while but rarely do I get to this side of town. I liked it! I'll be back, let's break it down

Atmosphere: Clean, well lighted,,, I felt healthy walking in. Smells fresh.  Basic seating set up.  I went at 11:30 Saturday and it was not too crowded,, people there but not too much.

Food: That's what you're here for right? The best description again is,,, clean.  Seems to me that it's all natural organic type food.  I've had burgers, Avocado/Crab cups, and some of the drinks.  Burgers are surprisingly juicy, and I'm looking to try some of the salads next time.

Drink: Note the smoothies are like a meal so you probably don't want that AND a full meal unless you are splitting.   The juices are all very nice and clean.  Favourite is the Wellness drink.

Price: For what it is,,  a little expensive,, a juice and any meal will be twenty.  One of the other Yelpers claimed it was the Whole Foods of restaurants and I think its a great comparison.

Miscellaneous: One of the few places I can think of that put calorie counts."}
{"text":"want food poisoning ? my burger was not even cooked unacceptable it was red raw on the inside 
leaving 5 stars so everyone sees this!!!!!!!
Photos attached!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost every day. It's such a great healthy option and it's very close to my gym. My favorite drinks are the wellness juice and the green smoothie. Watermelon is great, too! The bison cheese steak is delicious in a spinach wrap! And the make your own option keeps you mixing and matching every visit. The teriyaki sauce makes any of them taste good. You HAVE to try the sweet potato mash. The service is wonderful, as well. Y'all are always so friendly : )"}
{"text":"G & P gets better all the time. Varied menu selections make this a favorite place.  What impresses me as much as the food quality is the fact that if something is not to your liking (and no place is perfect) just explain that to them & they will eagerly make it right.  This is a quality, healthy, & well run restaurant with freshly prepared smoothies & food that will please you."}
{"text":"Very little flavor for the $47 +tip I spent.  My girlfriend and I decided to try a \"healthy\" spot for the first time. Chicken cheese wrap was juicy but had no taste. The buffalo chicken wrap was the better of the two and actually had flavor.  for fries they offered hicama, sweet potato and tofu. So i choose the hicama because I've tried it fried, and i know its good. They gave me raw hicama, and said that's how they always serve it. I also purchased ahi tuna tacos,  they also lacked flavor and were served on what tasted like an unheated corn tortilla. Best flavor was the replacement sweet potato fries i was up-charged for."}
{"text":"Best selection and a favorite every time I'm in vegas. The menu caters to all....diet, vegan, whatever. ...it's all good. The chocolate peanut butter Nanna shake rocks....."}
{"text":"Amazing place...healthy shouldn't taste this good! The staff was very friendly and explained all the small details I needed to make the best dining choice I have made in a while...keeper!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Really good, healthy, guilt-free food that doesn't feel healthy or guilty-free. The food is delicious and light. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or and early dinner. The juices and smoothies are fantastic as well. Made from scratch right in front of you from whole fruits and veggies.

Veggie Flatbread: Really tasty. They use unconventional veggies that normal wouldn't be on a veggie pizza. Artichoke hearts, Greek and black olives, spinach, orange bell peppers and classic red onions.  

Buffalo Chicken Flatbread: Right up my man's alley. Although there isn't a ton of buffalo sauce flavor, it's more of a BBQ chicken pizza, it's still scrumptious. Make sure you ask for ranch. It's a Greek yogurt ranch but it's so good. And guilt-free. 

Ginger Limeade Juice: I get this every time I go there. It's so light and refreshing. And a green drink so who can complain?  

I'll be frequenting this place often and definitely adding to my review with different menu items. Also I'd like to add that the restaurant was super accommodating to my dog on the patio. They gave him water in a cup and everything. So nice!"}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times for a guilt-free post-workout meal. I love the various options that make eating low carb easy. The proteins (chicken, salmon, etc.) always seemed to be well seasoned and tasty. But I recommend you ask about the preparation of your sides if you get a plate - sometimes they are not seasoned and you need to order a sauce that will compliment them well. 

Also - dog friendly. It has outdoor seating (in the shade) where they will bring you your food after you order at the counter."}
{"text":"I always get the wellness drink & the veggie pizza. They are delicious... Well everything I have tried always is. But why I love this place so much is their amazing customer service... It's the best."}
{"text":"Would be a 5 star but no employee knew the price for an extra ostrich patty, after a discussion the cook said between 5-8, a girl whispered to the cashier just do 8 thinking im deaf. No set price so charge as much as you can. Nice ethics"}
{"text":"Angus Burger 5/5
Tofu Fries 5/5 
Jicama Fries...cold sticks with seasoning that look like fries 5/5
Watermelon, Raspberry, and Strawberry Juice 4/5

Recommend and we will return"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!!!!  I came in with expectations of plain food and a \"granola\" crowd. Wow were my expectations wrong!!  The food was amazing, I built my own meal, with the turkey breast which was pretty amazing!  The servers were very friendly and appeared to enjoy their time at work. Overall the experience was excellent and I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor of greens and proteins just because they list their macros and it's good on the go. However today I went to dine in since I had extra time on my hands. I get there around 1:00-1:30 pm and it seems as they just cooled down from lunch hour. Anyways so I order a chicken teriyaki sandwich with cheese and grilled onions added. I usually pay around 13$ for this. This time they charged me almost 15$ I was shocked but I rolled with it and requested the receipt. Later when I looked at the receipt I saw they charged me $2.00 for some grilled onions rather than the usually $0.50. So I'm sure it was a mistake so I take it up to the cashier and she fixes the issue for me and refunds me the difference. So here I am now waiting on my food for almost twenty minutes which also wasn't a big deal because I wasn't in a rush. However once I receive my food it's just disappointment. I got a cold chicken sandwich with no cheese and no grilled onions. (What I paid extra for) and to top it off my sweet potato fries were cold and barely edible. Overall it was an upsetting meal."}
{"text":"Im used to going to they're Henderson location. I happen to find out online there was one rainbow which is close to my house. It sounds silly but I got terribly lost and called to find out where they were and I was just told by a Starbucks and a dispenseray. I asked if they were in the arroyo crossing market (where I was) and he wasn't sure. On the website and on the phone he said 215 and rainbow. They are actually not on the 215 and rainbow they are located on rainbow and sunset!! I finally found it. When I got there my food was cold so I asked if they could reheat it I was kind of in a rush though and they just made me a new wraps they said. I guess it didn't take that long but still. I wish they could've given me better directions at least now I know where it is I still love the food. I just don't love the prices or the fact that they couldn't tell me exactly where the location was."}
{"text":"I have since gone back to greens and proteins and ordered as suggested the impossible burger medium cooked. It is significantly better cooked that way. However, I ordered it to go with sweet potato fries and instead got tofu fries. I do recommend going to Greens and Proteins but I also recommend you making sure you get what you ordered before leaving. Of course by the time I discovered that I had the Tofu fries I was already home."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Very inconsistent. We get the angus burgers and they are amazing sometimes and sometimes horrible. Sweet potato fries are usually not cooked properly. I love the food on a good day and on a bad day it just tastes like dirty grill and old oil. I wish it was more consistent."}
{"text":"I just moved near this location and have been here 4 times in a week, with the hopes of making this my daily breakfast spot. That hope has been dashed each and every visit for a number of reasons. 

1. Slow service. I ordered a salad and a wrap on two separate occasions at 3 in the afternoon (not busy) and it took upwards of 25minutes. That's excessive. 

2. Order accuracy. Out of my 4 orders, they have forgotten an item altogether twice and gave me the wrong smoothie a third time. 

3. No desire to make things right. When an establishment continues to make mistakes, a simple \"sorry\" doesn't cut it. They should be fixing their problems, and they obviously aren't. 

I may be foolish, but i may give them one more chance to turn things around. We'll see.."}
{"text":"Very happy with this place. As far as healthy food places go, this would be one of the top. They have burgers, wraps and smoothies. I had the bison burger and it was great! They have \"tofu fries\" which I had not encountered yet, basically crispy tofu strips that they serve with a tasty dipping sauce. Seriously, you need to try this place if you are trying to eat a certain way or just want a more health conscious option. They break down menu items nutrition info, which is helpful to those on a diet. Staff are cool...I guess I'm gonna give it a five star review now, I didn't really write anything bad....well bowled Greens and Protein."}
{"text":"I was skeptical as I perused the menu today which on yelp has 4 items very strangely lumped together. My bf and I go eat brunch maybe once a week usually the same place, but were trying to be healthier so this seemed cool however far from our house. 

  The staff is incredible. Polite over achievers, really happy smiling bunch. Giving us samples as we waiting for the previous family decide their order. 

Green ginger lime juice was delicious. And a huge size compared to other similar joints. I got the turkey burger on wheat. Huge fresh patty grilled bun vegan cheese heirloom tomato not your average turkey burger. Tofu fries are very seasoned looking but not overwhelmingly spicy. Quite mild Could stand to bump up the heat a little even. Comes on a triangle plate which was fun. 

Bf got the chicken satay. Delicious good size portion excellent plating. Complimentary cucumber water probably was the highlight of it all for me. Id come back just for that. Stiff uninviting tables when you dine in but they're surpringly comfortable."}
{"text":"Came here for morning greens smoothie and the lady at front counter was very nice and accommodating to my orders. Smoothies tasted like how I made at home so I was happy. I would definitely go here again"}
{"text":"Acai Berry smooth is bomb....excellent....chef Calvin recommend a wellness drink so we shall see.......yep delicious"}
{"text":"I have been here everyday since they opened. The juices and smoothies are amazing. And the tofu fries are addicting. Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I go to greens and proteins 2-3x a week on the Decatur. Location. So since I was working in this area today  I thought to myself let me just grab some lunch from greens and proteins since I know what I like already. So I order my usual which is a teriyaki sandwich and sweet potato fries. I open it in the car cause I was starving and their sweet potato fries are usually so hot,crispy, and delish but this time I grab one and its just wet and soggy and limp.   Anyways I have hope and I'm like maybe it's a one off situation but nope when I get to my desk 5 mins later  and open my food all my fries are wet and soggy and my sandwich was broken and a mushy mess. (Mind you I didn't even pick it up still and this never happened at the Decatur location.) this was super disappointing especially since I spend a few extra bucks for quality. If it wasn't about health and quality I would just give my business elsewhere. Therefore as of now I'll stick to eating here when I'm around the Decatur location because I have been their consistently and have not had a bad experience."}
{"text":"So glad that this has opened up near our house. We used to go to the other locations a few times but they were a bit far away. Now that this has opened, we are visiting at least once a week, to work our way through the menu. The tofu fries are the best, and the salads are huge!! Perfect for hungry people like me and my husband!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. We originally were going to the sunrise cafe next door but they had a long wait and the place was packed so we decided to try this place out. 

The layout is not bad and it has a clean feel. They have a good selection on the menu. Customer service was not bad but not that great either. The girl at the counter wasn't too friendly but wasn't rude either. 

I decided to have the breakfast burrito and my girlfriend ordered the Acai bowl. 

The burrito was pretty good. Not too big but enough to be filling. I was not a fan of the  tofu potatoes that came on the side. But that's not a deal breaker.

Here is the part that knocks off a couple stars. The acai bowl was almost completely frozen still. It had possibly the worst texture and consistency I've seen in an acai bowl. It was topped with granola and fruit which is nice but no honey or agave which left a lot of flavor to be desired. If I'm going to pay 8$ for a bowl, at least make sure to take the time to finish blending the acai instead of sending the bowl out half frozen. 

So this place isn't terrible but could use some friendlier customer service, and I recommend shying away from the acai bowl."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate. Because the food is uniquely healthy. But and it's a big but. The customer service was very bad. The young man with the buffe hair cut must of been related to the owner because there is no way his smug kurt unapologetic way of non helping with ordering could be accepted anywhere else. He got the order wrong and the girl made us prove that we ordered and paid for water. The only thing I can say is reverse racist comes to mind. People keep that in mind when eating there. Otherwise food was good."}
{"text":"I ordered talapia, wakame salad, and white beans through door dash. I got the food quickly but the talapia was fishy and unseasoned. Pretty boring."}
{"text":"So after multiple check ins I finally decided to write a review. . .yeah yeah. . .we can all get lazy sometimes.  LOL

This last check in. . .I actaully tried their food for the first time.  Every other time that I have gone, I got smoothies.  More on them later. . .

I got their daily special of Turkey chili with cannellini beans.  TBH, I got it cuz it was warm and I was actually cold that day. . .LOL  But I gotta give them props. . .if you had not told me that it was \"healthy\" I would never had thought that it was.  It was freaking delicious!  The mouth feel was just like a meaty chili, flavor had just the small amount of heat that just made you want to take another bite.  It came with some lavash which added some great crunch to the dish.  I would go back just for this dish.  It was that good!!  And to think that it was acutally healthy for me. . .*gasp*  LOL  (5/5)

The second dish was kind of a fail for me.  I love chicken lettuce wraps and I order their \"RAW cashew\" chicken lettucs wraps.  The look of it was cute.  They served it on little butter lettuce leaves with a little micro greens on top.  The flavor was NOT like a chicken lettuce wrap.  The Texture was NOT like a chicken lettuce wrap. . .and like a dummy I didn't realize until that I bit into that it was a \"RAW\" food which meant that nothing was heated.  So it was a cold mealy scoop of cashews mixed with something on a lettuce cup.  I DO NOT reccomend.  Unless you are totally into RAW foods. . .I am guessing if I was that I might have liked it??  I honestly don't know what I was expecting BUT I was thinking with the words chicken lettuce wrap in it that it would feel like chicken and taste like a traditional lettuce wrap in my mouth?? (1/5)

Service. . .ALWAYS impeccable!  (5/5)

Smoothies. . .including the veggiechino. . .yes u read that right. . .a vegetable smoothie with espresso in it. . .OMG DELICIOUS!!!  (5/5)

Overall, heck yeah I am going back. . .BUT next time I will definitely skip the RAW foods section. . .lesson learned!  =)"}
{"text":"This location is no bueno! I'll start off by mentioning we go to the location on Rainbow and we are always satisfied.  Why a bad review? I'll preface with our experience the one time we came in about 30 min before closing... we try not to do this because we understand we \"hate\" the customers that come in right before closing. On that visit, we understood why our food might of seemed rushed (wrap was wrapped loosely, pizza was not as yummy, etc). 

Today, we came in around 5pm. Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and a wrap. I'm not exaggerating... it seemed like they forgot the BBQ on the \"BBQ chicken pizza!!!\" There were only BBQ on 2 of the 8 slices!!! I don't quite understand how that can happen.  Next, We ordered \"add avocado\" on the wrap.  I'm not sh!tting you... a small single slice was added to one side/corner of the \"cut in half\" wrap.  Last, the wrap was not properly wrapped as it just fell apart.  As a reminder... we go to the location on rainbow often and order the same items. We are definitely going to stop going to this location as every visit is disappointing.  I haven't checked if they are franchised/independently owned between these 2 locations but hopefully they can have more consistency. Until then I'll go elsewhere when around the Flamingo location."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food: It is healthy and very very good which is damn near impossible to find. So yea! 5 stars for food. Although if they got organic meat that would be freak-en amazing but whatev its still tasty & healthy that magical combination. 

I have been here at least 10 times so 3 Stars for counter help. They are not to friendly or helpful and I was charged more than what the menu states on a couple of occasions."}
{"text":"The customer service was so extraordinary, I am updating my review to reflect my experience. Both the owners responded to me. Whether they do or not is not personal for me - it's business. And they both care for their customers and their business. 
I got the Green Wellness Smoothie- tastes good AND I get my vegeys and fruits. Even my carnivorous buddy's getting a smoothie here. I love the concept. And the staff is friendly and helpful. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"As I sit here at your restaurant, I'm in disbelief at how horrible the service is. I was super excited to try this place. First my bill came up to $37.87 and all I had was $100 dollar bill so per your supervisor or employee he said he could not take the hundred because they are getting to many fake $100 dollar bills, so I really felt he was insinuating my money was fake! So I said okay went to Starbucks and got change I still wanted to try this place despite one red flag. I asked what was in the Veggie Burger he said it's right there on the menu read it, I thought that was very rude as this was my first time here I thought he could tell me. Then I order a Smoothie when I got the smoothie it had a very bad taste and I asked if he could change it to another one as I only took one sip. He said no, so then I asked for a refund he said no. So now I have no drink as it's behind the counter and no refund I've never been to a restaurant where if something wasn't to the customers liking they wouldn't remake it or give a refund. I was very disappointed at the service here and had very high hopes for this place!"}
{"text":"Had to stop into a place that holds two of my most prominent diet words in it's name. I really wish I had more time to try more of the menu, but, very limited amount of time in Vegas.

That said, the breakfast that was served to the table next to me looked amazing and I can't wait to try it.

This go around though, hammered down on the \"build my own\" with ostrich (check another animal off my \"got ya bitch\" list of animals consumed!), sketti squash and some mashed sweet taters. Also got an antioxidant blast smoothie (berry mix).

So, the chow.
Ostrich - very lean, and decent. Tried it without the citrus bbq sauce first, and it was ok. Was hoping for a bit of seasoning or something, but, it was just cooked meat and no seasoning help. With the citrus bbq, not bad at all and solid chunk of meat. Texture was and cooked temp were not bad either. All in all, a solid slab of lean meat.

Sketti squash - tasteless and didn't seem to be cooked enough. Was very disappointed in this one. I'm usually a huge fan of this and make it my own quite a bit (gives me something to do when my madre delivers 12 giant squashes from her garden). But, a little citrus bbq made it tolerable to wolf down like a desert coyote.

Mashed sweet taters - very good. Was really happy to see this on the menu as a carb option. I hadn't had them in a while, and was pleasantly surprised to have a solid plate of mashed sweets. Perfectly fluffy, not stringy (which sweet taters can be when mashed thanks to the fibers), and solid flavor. Only thing missing was a chance to throw some cinnamon on them. If you've  never done that before, give it a go. Fantastic. I promise.

Antioxidant smoothie - Great flavor, miss on the texture. I knew it'd be a bit think and chunky thanks to the apples (without an amazing juicer, apples are a prick to deal with). But, was hoping this place would have a juicer that'd take that away. Not so. 

In any event, smoothie and food rang up over $24. Considering the ingredients and if I were to order something similar elsewhere, I'm sure it'd be close to that too. So, not overly fussy with the price."}
{"text":"The chocolate penutbutter banana  smoothie is so delicious definitely my favorite, also best ahi protein salad. Love this place right after the gym."}
{"text":"The acai bowl is tasty, but really overpriced. They're lucky I ordered from postmates, if I had seen the small cup they were charging $8 for I would have gone and gotten twice as much for the same price somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place! Hands down one of the healthiest places to eat in Vegas! I do the lettuce cups. MMMMM...."}
{"text":"I get it, the food is fresh and healthy. And yes it is tasty, but it shouldn't take 30 minutes to make a wrap (to go)especially when the place isn't that busy.  I was starting to wonder if I was ever going to get my food at all. And then no apology for taking forever. Immediately regret tipping up front."}
{"text":"Best place ever in Vegas they have the best smoothies the best wraps the best burgers everything the people here are so nice it's so clean"}
{"text":"Healthy options if you don't feel like cooking after leaving the gym!

I used to come here a lot after my workouts since it is in the same shopping center as LVAC. Everything has the calories listed for the health conscious people.  The food is good and a little pricey which I don't mind since it is a lot healthier than Mickey D's."}
{"text":"We always get the Green Leaf Berry Blast which has only 255 calories.  Refreshing, filling and just the right amount of sweetness. Gave it 4 stars because at $7.50, I feel it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"I had already written a review but this one is for one of the workers. Daniel gives phenomenal service! Haven't received service like that in a while. He greeted me right when I walked in and even tho I didn't read need help, he engaged with guiding me through options and was just very kind. I didn't even tell him my name or anything, plus I paid in cash, and he called me by my name because he noticed my tiny keychain I had in my keys. I am just very impressed I needed to make this known, great job!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, clean and healthy, lots of choices!  Very busy most times. Very casual, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Healthy, real food. A perfect alternative from the strip or freemont. Personally I needed a healthy juice after a night out so we'll say it's good for hangovers too 

Smoothies ($7.50) are large and yummy and have almond and soy milk as additives. The cold brew ($4.5) is actually like a pre workout because it has added supplements and caffeine.

I reduced my stars because this was nothing fancy and the shop was supposed to open at 7:00am and the staff didn't even show up until 7:15. :/"}
{"text":"The wellness drink is the only green drink I have ever been able to drink... and actually enjoy! It just tastes like apples to me, and they sneak in a ton of healthy other stuff like kale etc. All of their food has been pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Had the tofu fries-perfectly done with great dipping sauce. Also had the banana chocolate smoothie-incredibly delicious! Love this place. Definite stop on every work trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had worse service. 

Came to enjoy a nice meal with my family after a workout class. Took over an hour until we got all of our food and nothing was correct.

First, we were brought 1 salad (which was the wrong salad) and the server left before we could even let her know. It then sat on our table for 20 minutes, untouched until the server came back. We then watched the serve bring this same exact salad that already sat on our table to a table two tables away.

When we finally started getting more of the food which was 20 minutes after this, nothing came out at the same time. Everything we ordered came out incorrect. 
Salads, did not have dressing on the side, 
Ahi was terribly was over cooked, there were tomatoes when we asked three times for them not to be included on the wrap and then when the wrap was brought back again, it was evident that the tomatoes were just scraped out as there was still tomatoes in the wrap. They also forgot about the French toast, only the easiest thing on the freaking menu.

We asked for the manager to come out half way through this dilemma of everything not working correctly and we waited for over 40 minutes before we were even addressed.

There was no real resolution, service sucks at this location and is a real let down for a brand which we all previously enjoyed. Way to not put the customer first."}
{"text":"Always my favorite spot to eat with in Vegas. I'm from Southern California and a picky eater. I can definitely appreciate healthy CLEAN food. This place delivers perfectly. Staff is always friends. Highly recommended place for healthy clean food. Bodybuilders, fitness enthusiasts and competitors can still stay on their diet here. Everything is measure and calories are given."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming, this clean and organized store is light and spacious, and the staff are really polite and friendly. I also love how they have quite a few local business cards and promo materials at the pickup counter where you get your drinks- shows that they are involved in the local community, which I really like to see.

That being said, their smoothies and wraps are each around $8, which sounds about on par with other similar businesses- and for the smoothies I would say it's about right.
But I was not impressed with my tofu/chorizo breakfast wrap- I asked for it in a spinach wrap, which I use frequently at home to make my own wraps, and this one was not particularly full. Most bites had more overlapping layers of tortilla than filling or veggies. On top of that, the menu lists the wrap as coming with \"a side of tofu homefries\"- this sounded really cool to me and I was excited to check it out.
Imagine my surprise when I open my take out box in my car and realize that a \"side\" consists of exactly THREE crouton-sized pieces of tofu. They were tasty, but considering I spent $8 on my meal and my take out box was half empty, I'm not pleased. I genuinely don't know if someone was in a hurry and forgot my side, or if three pieces really constitutes a portion- it doesn't to me.

I might come back, but it won't be for food- which is really disappointing, because everything sounds great.

Side note: If you check in on Yelp, you get a dollar off of a juice or smoothie, which helps a bit with the pricing."}
{"text":"Super tasty and very healthy. The interior was appealing and the staff where really nice. My only few negatives is I wish there were more options on green Smoothies and the staff was a bit unorganized."}
{"text":"I am really not sure what the fuss is all about with this place. The service is abhorrently slow, they aren't particularly customer-centric and the prices for what you get are super high.

I've been in several times, don't know why I'm just now writing this, but I get the same thing generally every time.

This time walked up and was just asking a generic question, but was definitely ready to order when the guy in front of me picked up the phone and spent 3-4 minutes taking someone's order that was calling in. I just stood there and stared until he was done. Super rude.

Ordered the vegetable parm and it came with a small side of spinach. I was under the impression that I was getting a side of spaghetti squash, but it was actually UNDER the parm. Weird. This small plate of absolutely nothing cost me $10. Not happy. 

I've had pizza here before as well and while it had a nice taste to it, it again wasn't worth what I paid for it.

I get the concept here and I'm sure it looks cool when you hang out a place that touts itself as so healthy, but it really is a ripoff and the food isn't that great; it's just OKAY. 

Save some money and do it yourself, really."}
{"text":"Very good. Wellness drink is refreshing and French toast is hearty, sweet, and delicious. Big portion. Definitely not \"fast food\" meaning your gonna wait 10 minutes for food. Could use another location in Highlands Ranch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Green shake, wraps, chopped salad, sweet potato fries. Love them all!!!"}
{"text":"During the fall, I will go slightly out of my way to step on a crunchy-looking leaf. Similarly, when I'm looking for healthy eats, I will go out of my way to come to this G&P location over the one by 215 and Flamingo- better product and service all the way around, totally redeemed the brand after my dismal visits to the other location!

Menu is packed with healthy options and every single item has the macros listed: calories, carbs, fats, and proteins, making my life so much easier. Standout items include any/all of the salads (particularly the ahi), and my guy digs the ostrich burger (don't forget the bbq sauce!). Love how you can customize everything, whether adding products to the shakes or ingredients to the salads (the tofu is perfect) or opting for a gluten free bun or cabbage wrap for your burgers/sandwiches. 

Location never seems to get too busy but is conveniently located. Staff are attentive, outgoing, and genuinely nice guys happy to make recommendations. Going to try the protein pancakes next!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I ate at this place... I wanna say over a year? I've had nothing, but good experiences whenever I was here! They offer a good variety of meals for people who are watching their diet. They offer salads, burgers, sandwiches, bowls, smoothies, and juices. 
 
I came here for dinner with my girlfriend today and was pleased at how clean it still is after being around for couple years. The staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had regarding the menu. I ordered the bison burger and my girlfriend ordered the bison cheesesteak. Definitely not the healthiest things, but we were hungry... GAINZ. One thing I love about them is that they always have the cucumber water and it tastes so refreshing! We sat outside because the weather was nice and our meals did not take too long to make as well. The server brought it out to us and made sure we had everything that we needed. The bison burger was amazing! I got it medium rare and glad I did because you can feel the juices with every bite! They cooked it perfectly and it definitely tasted a lot cleaner than your usual burger. My girlfriend enjoyed her cheesesteak and took half of it home because the other half got her full. We got tofu fries as our side and I suggest anyone to get it! It's so good! The price range for the two items is around $10-$12 each I believe. Couldn't remember the exact price. Overall I prefer this over protein source as they have better tasting food! Price is about the same."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a great option for people trying to eat healthy. They even have pizza! All the calories are displayed and the staff has always been super friendly towards me. I went there for lunch yesterday and waited for about 20 minutes for my food, which is unusual there. I went up to the counter just to check where I was in line and they already knew I had waited too long and gave me a $15 gift card for the trouble. That's great customer service!"}
{"text":"I have yet to actually sit down for a meal here but it always smells good. I go in for wellness drinks and they always taste consistently delicious. The service can't be beat - swift and with a smile. I usually go on my way to work so I don't have time for the full blown meal but think I should soon considering the amazing reviews of items that I would like to experience."}
{"text":"My first time here! The hummus is freshly made. The salad is a decent size and the dressing was delicious. Everything I need to change the way I eat.  Will definetly be back"}
{"text":"My gf and I love this place, they are so friendly and offer a wide variety of healthy food options. So conveniently placed next to a HUGE gym. Lol."}
{"text":"This place is great! Service has always been top notch. I go once or twice a week always to find something new and delicious. Chicken Tacos, BBQ chicken pizza, Steak salad, cheese steak wrap w/ spinach tortilla and Bison burger have been excellent. Food is always fresh and cooked to order. Great cook on the meats and seasoned properly. I cook a lot at home and when I don't this is one place I look forward to frequenting."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. Bought a watermelon juice $6. Didn't like it. Sister got a smoothie that was better then my drink for $7.50. Decor was modern. Lots of people were there who looked like they just left the gym. Probably good for people who are super healthy.  I didn't find it very welcoming."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up here. I love coming to eat here but it's a little ways away as I live in the centennial area vs. Aliante. This place is so yummy and you don't have the guilt of eating here. Even hubby enjoys coming here. I'm not a fan of their jicama fries as they are cold, but the tofu fries are yummy! The bbq pizza is great and so are the bison burgers and Philly wraps. There are more options to make it healthier and gluten free. It's slightly pricey. I just wish America had more affordable places to eat healthier. But I think it's worth the price cause this is what you're putting into your body. Now if only they delivered ! ;)"}
{"text":"Good price for food. But not much flavor in my opinion. Good for price though. Ambiance is done well. Looked like people loved the smoothies though. I'll try that next time if I go."}
{"text":"My first visit today and I ordered the buffalo wrap. The flavor was on point. So good I cannot even put it into words. I think I found .y new favorite spot. The only drawback..no paper menu to look at...had to ask about ingredients on several items before finally ordering."}
{"text":"What can I say except for healthy can be good! It's about time I try to get a hold on my health and Protein and Greens provide a great variety of food and drinks to help you on your journey. 

Menu item are kinda pricey as expected but it's not cheap to feel and look good. But you can either pay now for healthy food option or later with your health. 

Regardless if you do try them out you won't be disappointed. I order the Cali Wrap with spinach tortilla and no added avocado but the whole meal with tofu fries was under 300 cal. What? Unheard of. The wrap was big filled with yummy grilled chick a bit dry but flavorful. Tofu fries was crispy and on point I didn't miss the potato. I got the green shake with almond milk which was good and creamy. They also have awesome cucumber lemon water which was refreshing. 

All that was $19.99 like I said a bit pricey for one meal but worth every penny.  The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was uber hip. I'm a new fan and will come back for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey burger and asked for the turkey not to be overcooked, guess what I think they over cook it on purpose, heard negative comments from staff. I know turkey is not eaten raw, but it shouldn't be dry either.  I remember when they first opened and it was the best place, now... not so much."}
{"text":"If you're looking to indulge without feeling any guilt, Greens and Proteins is the perfect spot to stop by.

The Greek Pizza is ridiculously good and leaves you feeling absolutely satisfied.  It consists of house made hummus, tomatoes, cucumbers, calamata olives, basil, mozzarella, and crumbled feta cheese. Eat the whole thing. It's not difficult, I promise.

My friend opted for the California Grilled Chicken Wrap which was just as good. It has lettuce, tomatoes, turkey bacon, and extra virgin mayo.

Give this place a try if you're looking for a light lunch or a quick bite without the remorse."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes they have a lot of healthy and tasty options from sandwiches to salads to tacos, smoothies, and juices. However, My experience wasn't that pleasant. There was only one gal around on the register and the phone, understandably taking a big order so I patiently waited. Someone else came out who let me know I would be helped in one moment and as soon a the gal got off the phone she didn't acknowledge me and walked away. I ended up being helped and he was polite and guided my through the menu but the same woman dropped off my food and again wouldn't acknowledge me when I said, \"thank you.\" To top it off, the sweet potato fries were only slightly warm. 

I understand that sometimes things get a little hectic but it really made my experience unpleasant."}
{"text":"I love the other greens and protein. I even gave the one on Eastern 5 stars for their amazing customer service and food. I went to the new one on rainbow yesterday and it was weird. The server was very nice, but was having difficulty using their new system. Even the other person working seemed to find it confusing. It was pretty dead inside which is unusual for a Greens and Protein, but our food took forever. We didn't even get an acknowledgement or an apology for it taking so long. I believe the other people that were there might have known the owners or managers because kids of theirs were running around and going in and out of the back room. Also, a dog was barking. We couldn't tell if it was from the back office or kitchen, but we're hoping it wasn't the kitchen. The food was still great, but everything else made me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Drinks are not consistent some have more then then at other times. Sometimes just foam at top. Other than that, it tasted great."}
{"text":"Omg i love this place. The food and drinks are always on point. People are very nice. I usually go around lunch and its pretty packed so it may take a while to get your food, but the food always makes up for it. I like to venture out and try new things here from the menu! So far I have likes everything I've tried."}
{"text":"Cesar was so nice! I think he's the head chef. 
We eat here all the time. There was a mistake with a dish, and he went above and beyond to remedy it. Great place with great survive! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I love everything I've drank and eaten at this place! Fresh, clean, healthy!"}
{"text":"My friend Andie and I both love this place. Perfect post workout meal. The sweet potato fries and wraps are really good choices"}
{"text":"For healthy low calorie food, it is delicious! The customer service from employees is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple time's great fresh tasting food and very healthy.
the Low Carb Caesar Salad With Grilled Chicken Breast is the best salad i've ever had."}
{"text":"Tofu fries! The yummiest snack! Especially while I'm studying! Also their wellness drinks are amazing especially after a good workout"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. You can leave here feeling full and not guilty for having just eaten  that. The food is not only healthy but tastes amazing. It's top notch in my book.  I've tried pretty much everthing  on the menu from there burgers to there wraps and I'm quite impressed.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Came in here for a pick up order, food was amazing! Had the angus burger with potatoe fries."}
{"text":"I still come here just for the food because there is nothing else close that offers healthY options. The staff is standoffish. I don't know if it's because it's 7a and they don't want to be there or what. But if you can, go to the Eastern location. Everyone there is so much more friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had the wellness drink, ginger limeade, the veggie pizza and veggie burger. The variety of health food choices they have is very broad and it's a great spot for anyone with specific dietary needs. Easy slot for picky health eaters as well. Food tastes great!"}
{"text":"Great options, fairly priced. Got an apple pie smoothie, was good texture, wish it was just a bit sweeter"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had the veggie burger and was blown away. Helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a physique competitor so I usually cook my own food during a contest prep. However, my wife and I were out looking for a place to grab something that fit my dietary needs and it came down to Protein House or Greens and Proteins. We went into Protein House and looked at their menu but nothing jumped out to us. Further, I didn't like that they don't have macronutrient  information on their menu at Protein House. 

So we headed to Greens and Proteins and were pleased as always. Prepared how I would prepare it at home but it's cooked by someone else so it's better! . The food really is delicious so I highly recommend that if you haven't been there, you go!"}
{"text":"Delicious but I want more vegan options. It's really disappointing and kind of frustrating when the place is marketed as a vegan restaurant but there's only one or two things that I can actually order. I would love to have more options"}
{"text":"short and sweet this place is awesome! the wellness drink is great and the tofu fries were a nice surprise! if I had one of these places close to home I would come here every day!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat healthy meals and the smoothies are delicious. They have, electrical outlets and you can sit outside which is nice. The atmosphere is cool and management is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wellness drink my absolute fav!!! I tried the veggie burger & although it is made fresh...it was a little dry. Needs some hummus or some type of cilantro pesto something....overall I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I had the Albacore Salad, it was good but the Ginger Limeade is wonderful. Packed with spinach, ginger, and sweetened with frozen green grapes. I was very surprised with the juice flavor combinations here. My order was not complicated but they staff was fast and very nice. It is a bit pricey for a quick lunch but I would treat myself again and maybe try a burger."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about going here because I thought it would be flavorless since its so healthy... This place is REALLY GOOD!! I havent had anything that wasnt good yet, I would go here more often if it was closer.  I really like the Bison Wrap and the Margarita Pizza but the pizza to get is the BBQ Chicken Pizza!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place finally because of all the great Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately I wasn't excited when I finally went and checked out the prices.  You get what you pay for, right? Eh.

This was a stop after yoga - I thought it would be nice to have a low-calorie fruit smoothie to come back to reality before going home and cooking/cleaning.  I ordered the Loaded Antioxidant Chiller - green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, agave nectar (188 cal).

The lady at the cash register seemed pretty indifferent, so I can't say if it was good or bad service. Indifferent service? Sure. It was a bit of a wait for JUST a smoothie when there were only 2 or 3 people ahead of me.  The atmosphere is nice at least - I do enjoy the indoor waterfall wall and natural tables.

Got my smoothie and left.  The taste was good - nothing to really OMG over - but I don't think it was almost $6 something good - and that was with my $1 off Yelp check-in!

I dunno, maybe I need to order food but the prices are a HUGE turn-off.  The yummy pictures of tofu fries may bring me back.  Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place! I am new to Vegas and was looking to try a few places like this in the area. 

There's a similar establishment across the parking lot. However, I went there and enjoyed the food but the staff was rude. 

Greens and Protein had both delicious, nutrient dense food and extremely friendly and helpful staff. I was sitting outside and a manager was leaving to go home. He said goodbye to all three tables on his way out. Small things like that earn my business back every time!

I also love that the menu includes caloric values which is helpful to me on a contest prep diet. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a 2 star rating but i have to do that now , we stopped coming here because of customer service being a little rude when we asked why they are out of items and constantly (95%) of the time being \"out\" of an item , always out of the various soups that are now no longer on the menu , out of shake/smoothie items , out of various other items as well that honestly made it very difficult to order something. We stopped coming here for about 6 months or more and finally wanted to give it another try and we came back , same basic problems, new items out this time there new \"thai chicken bowl\" which was actually recommended over the phone they were out . 

I understand this is a problem with dealing with some types of items but it honestly makes it annoying to have to call in and check if half the menu is available before i come in . 

I will say the managers are typically really nice and one girl who we see all the time working is also nice so that's good for sure but not sure we will be returning."}
{"text":"Does this look like an açaí bowl to you? Worst bowl I've had from anywhere. There weren't any strawberries the granola was soggy and they even put raisins in it! Who puts raisins and pineapple in an açaí bowl? I don't even know what the slush at the bottom was."}
{"text":"This is place is the best!! Generally I'm never looking to be out of town for work and having to find cool and healthy place to eat but someone recommended Greens and Proteins to me and that's the best food recommendations i heard in a long long time! When i looked at the menu it took me 5 minutes to decide what i wanted cause everything looked so good and i could eat here every meal for 2 weeks without having to eat twice the same thing so i could try everything that looks good! And not only it looks good on the menu but the food is equally amazing!! If you're looking for healthy food that taste amazing look no further, this is it! You can thank me later! On top of that the staff is super friendly and the place is squeaky clean! My only regret is that they're only Vegas based so far, please, please Greens and Proteins needs to open some locations in LA (Woodland Hills maybe lol) cause people would love it there! If you like Whole Foods you're gonna love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Happy to have found this place! Everything on the menu is great but my favorite is the seared tuna salad. Their juices are super yummy and the berry one is my favorite. 

It's hard to find a great health spot around here that doesn't just sell smoothies. Oh and hello they have bowls and metal utensils!! Love it.

Staff is all super friendly and they have great suggestions. Especially about the smoothies. I haven't tried the Bison yet but oh it's going to happen. 

Only downfall is the atmosphere is kinda quite and cold. A little uninviting maybe? Idk honestly it could have been the time of day I go. But I will keep coming back to this place regardless because their food is super good and super good for you!"}
{"text":"Honestly everything I have had in here has been delicious; I really like the menu and I love their wraps and salads.  It's just good food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good & fresh food!! Salmon & sautéed broccoli. Their sweet potato fries is also so good. Not to mention their juices are so fresh & satisfying. I'm always craving one!"}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and the cashier didn't explain that the juices were not \"juiced\" but broken down by a masticating machine. So we had a full on conversation about posting that information up. Gave this place a 2 because the owner was somewhat accommodating. I didn't enjoy my juice at all, so they have me a bottled water. So, I basically bought a $5 bottle of water and some egg whites and ground turkey sausages that took 15 minutes to make. Mind you, I was one out of two customers."}
{"text":"Would have given a 4 or 5 star rating but for the one big issue I had. I ordered the Bison Wrap and specifically requested \"NO GREEN PEPPERS\"!!!
I get my wrap and the first thin I see is that it's full of green peppers... SMH
Sent it back and they made me a new one. It was yummy."}
{"text":"I figured it's about time I write a review! I come to greens about everyday sometimes twice a day.. to the point that the staff on every shift know who I am by name,  there is not one thing I have tried on the menu I didn't love. And I've tried breakfast, lunch, small pickings, salads pretty much everything. My favorites on the menu are,  pancakes, scrambled egg and turkey sausage, turkey breast, bell peppers and their sweet potato fries are life!!!! They have all the macros for the food so it's really easy to fit into your day. And the owner and staff are amazing! If you haven't already go.  You won't regret it"}
{"text":"yummy! I love this place! Sadly, my husband is not into it as much as I am so I can only go there by myself...or when I force him to go with me :) Yeah some of the stuff are not as tasty as others. Learn what you like from the menu and then you will be just fine."}
{"text":"Not much more can add to reviews with Greens and Proteins...right? Oh but there one thing that stands out BIG time that must give out  yelp love. The main reason got bumped up to five star! I have been the other location on my side of town. Wow! The food am sure just as good (on this visit only came in for recovery smoothie aka went with Green Leaf Berry Blast) as the other location. I have always been fan of with the healthy choices. The prices can be pricey but in this case your getting the quality you pay for and they have nice diversity of options. The WOW factor for me. The interior design was SOOOOO much more pleasant then the other location. Maybe its because I believe this is the mother ship or the first one in Vegas. So the interior design is totally pimped out with personality and makes you want too come back rather then the bland blah interior of the other location. Here so many things that stands out soon as walked in. The fake waterfall coming down on the wall, the green chairs, couple wide screens places next to the waterfalls, and everywhere look love the interior design. The fountain area with the cucumber water dispenser adds nice touch then your normal fountain station area. The customer service is fabulous. I jus wished they could have flip flop the interior design to the one closer my side of town then I would be duke. Lol!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all!! This healthy food chain is pretty fantastic. It is super clean, service is friendly, and the food is good. They have their calorie counts clearly listed, and tons of options! I was actually pretty overwhelmed by all of the choices. Most items average close to $10, so this isn't the cheapest lunch spot, but all things considered (including the refreshing-and free- cucumber water), I can't gripe about spending a few extra dollars."}
{"text":"Would have gotten 5 stars if the guy at the register didn't mess up my meal. He charged me twice for a build your own meal. I called and noticed the charge, and he told me to come in next time so he can take care of it. When I came in, I asked to have my meal he said he was gna take care of, and I added a 6 dollar soup. He charged me for my whole meal and told me soup was taken care of. No you moron, as a courtesy of good customer service for messing up my meal before, you should take care of my 12 dollar meal. And I'll pay for my 6 dollar soup separately. Idiot."}
{"text":"Ok...so sorry it's been a while. Just noticed the owner is REALLY on top of things. (I'm just now seeing a old response). The location on Rainbow is amazing. I never used the coupon but don't need to. I've found my spot & I will continue to go there. I have to get my tofu fries! Yum! Thank you to the owner once again for being so passionate about his business!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  The Eastern location is difficult to get in and out of especially in rush hour traffic.  But, well worth it!"}
{"text":"I eat at Greens and Proteins two or three times a week.  My favorite is the Margharita Pizza on lavash.   It is awesome!!!  Great pizza with very little calories (I think they said 300!!!!). 

Looking for a nice healthy drink from their juice bar? The Green Shake with almond milk is ridiculous!!!  If you want more of a pure juice there's nothing better than the Wellness Drink...

They just started doing breakfast and their Tofu and chicken sausage wrap is awesome.  I don't ever eat Tofu but the chef made me a deal. He said if the Tofu in the wrap was not as good or better than egg whites he would give me my money back.  I'm hooked!!!  Healthy AND good breakfast???  Saweeeeet!"}
{"text":"Really really love this place!!! I'm busy and don't have a lot of time to cook but like to eat healthy! This place is not only healthy it's delicious...I eat here a few times a week and I alway get the best service and a great meal quickly. Can't wait until they open more locations...like right by my office ;)"}
{"text":"I just placed an order for the teriyaki bowl, vegan style (no meat) and I got home to find it full of chicken. I asked the person I ordered from if it could be vegan style and she said yes.  I had to throw the whole bowl away."}
{"text":"Well... I seem to have forgotten that healthy things don't taste as good as deep fried not healthy things.  

I stopped by on my lunch because I wanted a smoothie to sip on throughout the afternoon at work.  When I walked in, I immediately liked the environment.  Everything was open and clean.  There was only one person in front of me, who was finishing paying.  She and the man behind the register were having a friendly conversation... that continued for quite some time and in to the time where she was waiting for her food.  I was only slightly annoyed since I was on a time constraint.

I ended up ordering the Green Leaf Berry Blast with soy because it sounded both delicious and tasty.  Upon receiving it, I was surprised at its brownish color (which later understandably turned green due to the veggies in it).   My first sip was a shocker... I was not a fan.  I drink soy milk all the time in replacement of regular milk.  There was just a taste that reminded me of liquid Maalox.  I honestly think that my choice on the menu was just a poor one and I would have been better off with a juice.  Next time, I will definitely opt for one of those.  I feel bad that I wasted over $8, but I've definitely learned my lesson!"}
{"text":"First visit: caffeinated smoothie. TERRIBLE. You think it'd be good, combining two of my favorite things. Think again! 

Second visit: berry smoothie. Still not a good flavor. Plus, my friend order a small cheese pizza for her four year old (no kids menu options). Pizza came out wrong. They were nice and quickly fixed the situation after minor pushback. 

Overall- overpriced and overrated. I wish we had better smoothie place options in this area for post gym snacks!"}
{"text":"Delicious and way healthy for what I'm used to! I guess that's a good thing after having giving birth to a baby boy and slacking off on the workout. It kinda makes me want to go back to the  gym. Had the granola French toast and wellness drink. Hubby got the p&g breakfast burrito..yum! All tastey and good, but way too pricey for my drink and toast was a bit soggy. Thank god for groupons!!!"}
{"text":"so good - and as long as you eat within reason, its great for those who are keeping to a clean diet. I also like how they have all the calorie counts on everything so you know exactly what you're going to ingest. :)"}
{"text":"I love that Greens and Proteins is a health-conscious restaurant that offers vegetarian/vegan options! . 

The food is amazing and the customer service is excellent! I love the G&P veggie burger, tofu fries, grilled vegetable wrap, hummus and pita, the build your own meal, (with tofu, edamame, sweet potato mash and aged balsamic reduction) acai bowl, granola crusted french toast, pancakes, and the banana bread, made with walnuts and chocolate chips! ANNOUNCEMENT: They are now serving sweet potato fries - yum! I LOVE that they do not fry any meat or fish, which prevents cross contamination for those who have dietary concerns. 

My meat-eating fiance likes the mini Ahi tostadas, Ahi protein salad, the California grilled chicken wrap and all of the above! He has yet to try a burger but they have only been open for a couple of weeks. We still have more to try!

I have been trying to eat healthier and be more aware of my portions, especially with the wedding around the corner. It is extremely helpful to have an idea of how many calories I am consuming per meal. However, I have let them know they should add the calorie count for the tofu fries - for consistency, of course. No joke, but I have been losing some weight after working out, along with eating a couple of meals here per week.

It is safe to say, I am a bit obsessed. Enjoy!

*New location in North Las Vegas. Please see my review."}
{"text":"Finally, there is a nearby, health-conscious restaurant that offers vegetarian/vegan options! The location is a bit tricky, as it is located across from Del Taco and not within the direct LVAC parking lot as stated on menus found at other locations, along with their own. I would highly suggest a \"Grand Opening\" sign if at all possible to help gain more customers.

{"text":"The foods great and It's great to see vegan options on the menu, but recently when I called in my order of a veggiechino smoothie (delicious!) I was told it would be ready in 5 mins, when I got there to pick up my order it wasn't ready and I ended up waiting 20 mins before I left smoothie-less and disappointed. The foods really really great, they just need a little work on their customer service."}
{"text":"I went back to the restaurant to give it another chance , this time I went there with my boyfriend the service was great and the food this time was EXCELLENT I loved my salad & my boyfriend loved the burger & the humus we will absolutely come back yum."}
{"text":"Got the bbq pizza and it was great! But I hope they don't cLose that earLy 'cause a Lot of peopLe are stiLL coming in and got turned down. Got there 15mins before cLosing and they said they stiLL accept orders but aLL the chairs are aLready up. and you can teLL the cooks are upset."}
{"text":"Great service, coffee is good and hot, breakfast is amazing AND healthy.  Do yourself a favor in Vegas and take a break from the buffets - come to Greens and Proteins at one of their 5 locations.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed.  Clean, healthy and delicious food.  The owner is friendly, as well as the staff.  A little pricey, but a nice treat  for every once in a while....ahem, week.  Oh, and I love the decor.  Feels open and bright."}
{"text":"I like the idea of healthy food as an alternative to the usual fast food fair, but they always take so long and the food is just not that good. I like the menu but I feel like they could add a bit more flavor. The healthy food I make at home tastes good, their food is quite bland."}
{"text":"I love this place great food, great empolyees I come in regularly and they are nice enough to remember my name and greet me with a smile. They never fail to make me feel welcomed thank you guys! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way home to California and I fell in love!
They have a fantastic menu full of good for you food!
I wanted to badly to eat something, but I had eaten about an hour before I went but we did want juice.
I got a ginger limeade and it was fantastic! 
Only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is that it's a bit pricey, but with what they use I get it.
Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Really savory food, great customer service and overall we were all pleasantly surprised. We ordered 2 kids burgers, a salmon plate and the cheese stake sandwich. Oh' also ordered the hummus plate, not my favorite.

Portions were fantastic, great tasting food and portions were pretty satisfying.

Keep it rolling guys. We'll definetly come back!"}
{"text":"Yummy, healthy and clean tasting food. It is so nice to have a place like Greens and Proteins near my office! Online ordering was fast, easy and my food was ready to go when I arrived. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite place for healthy eats. I have never been disappointed and I eat here a couple times a month. Although I am not a vegetarian, their black bean burger is amazing. I really like the bison wrap as well and their turkey chili. Eating healthy for the average person isn't typically fun, but this place changes things! Try the sweet potato fries as your side with any order, they're my favorite!"}
{"text":"Cool Premise, very trendy, free wifi.  

I enjoyed the premise of the place.... Greens... and ... wait for it... Proteins...   

I really enjoyed their tea sampling, unsweetened of course.  

I had the bison burger wrap, which was delicious.  I had the tofu fries, which I did not care for.  I should have went with the alternative, yucca fries.  

The atmosphere is cool, friendly people working, healthy people eating, and then me..  who typically goes for taco bell, but was slumming it for a day with the healthy people leaving LVAC.  

Overall, a cool place with great offerings and free wifi."}
{"text":"Food is always great, but called order for SALAD 30 minutes ago and it's still not ready."}
{"text":"My favorite spot when we're looking to eat clean. Normally get the angus burger in a lettuce wrap (they always cook it at the right temp as ordered).  Get the chicken satay for starters (that all natural peanut sauce is amazing).  I've pretty much tried all the pizzas there and they are all very light and satisfying.  Highly recommend the protein pancakes when you're bulking up."}
{"text":"Greens is my everyday lunch spot. There are so many options. I never get bored. Tofu fries, extra crispy, the bison wrap or the low calorie Caesar salad with salmon are to die for. Never thought eating healthy could be so yummy and addicting. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the quality, taste, and portion size of their Bison wrap sandwich. (Excited to try the Ostrich wrap next time.) The Tofu Fries were a fun and tasty alternative to french fried potatoes. Again, really generous portion. Every juice and smoothie I've had has been really good - I would suggest asking the juice-maker on staff which one she/he recommends based on your likes and dislikes. They will suggest one and dial it in for you. 

The food may be a dollar or two more than a comparable cafe-style restaurant, but you truly get it back in terms of portion size and quality. It takes one visit to realize this.

And, the staff actually looks healthy here. That says a lot!

Wish I lived closer. Will definitely eat here next time I'm at Eastern/215 for the Cars & Coffee car meetup on Saturdays.

FYI, there seem to be 'green' health cafe imitators popping up around the Valley. Try Greens and Proteins first - this place is the real deal. Greens and Proteins reminds me of R Thomas in Atlanta (a 24hr health food cafe) and that is a compliment. 

Also, there is free Wi-fi here, and I noticed power outlets all along the back booths (like over 40 outlets in a row) so this would be a great alternative to a coffee shop if you need to hunker down and get some laptop work done."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! We got the BBQ pizza and chicken sausage pizza. Sooo good! Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Got the green leaf berry smoothie. It was horrible. Didn't say anything until a worker asked how it was. I bluntly said, \"This tastes like sh*t.\" Which it did because the worker said it doesn't even look the right color. He then asked if he could make it right. I asked if he could make me a peanut butter banana instead. He came back with a better tasting concoction. Way to do service recovery. Thumbs up to Kevin (the worker who saved the night.)

Update: All I drank after the gym was the shakes. I ended up tasting them again...Something in those drinks just didn't agree with me. My girlfriend has the chorizo wrap and didn't have any issues. She enjoyed it and didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but if you like bland smoothies, you're at the right spot.  We ordered ginger lemonade and watermelon raspberry and we tasted was ice.  Not worth the money for something so tasteless."}
{"text":"So excited they serve the vegan impossible burger meat here. We tried it in their vegan cheese steak and it's freaking incredible. It's a must try. 

Also had the vegan BBQ chick'n pizza which was super tasty.

Thank you for offering more vegan options. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great location here in the same plaza as LVAC. The food is average pricing, but I think the drinks are a bit pricey (over $8 for a juice drink)... but I guess with the quality ingredients, it can be expensive to be healthy, right? Got the Wellness drink (can't remember the exact name) and at first I wasn't a fan, but it tasted better with each sip, plus super healthy. They do have a good menu with drinks, breakfast options, and wraps/sandwiches/etc."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the one in Henderson in Eastern, but since changing jobs I decided to check out the Summerlin location. It was fairly easy to find, though my GPS tried to steer me through a gated community and out a non-existent exit. The place was clean and had a decent crowd at lunch time. We didn't have to wait long for our food. They forgot to give my friend her number for her food, so we did have to ask about that. Also, I always think they are pricey. The food is good though, I never have any complaints there. We had tacos, chicken and steak, and my favorite hummus plate. I keep coming back and paying because it is consistently good. I'm glad I found a new location by my new offices."}
{"text":"The Wellness Juice is by far the best juice I've ever had in my life! My toddlers went crazy for it and drank so much of it! I love that you can get a pizza, or a healthy salad, all in one location. I've never tasted anything from here that I didn't absolutely love."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Super fresh but a bit pricey (you get what you pay for). Ordered their turkey burger with a side of tofu fries. Burger had A LOT of meat and tofu was cooked/seasoned perfectly. Definitely want to try out some of their fresh juices next time!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly, and I love the atmosphere! 

You have to try the tofu fries and any of the pizzas!!

They also have exotic meets like ostrich and bison burgers! 

Mm mm try the cucumber lemon water."}
{"text":"I have been meaning too get this off my bookmark tonight finally did. I always heard about the location on the opposite end of world for me. Once learned about there newest location excited about chance too get my Greens and Proteins on. I no means hardcore comes too healthy eating but generally try all my meals healthy. Truly is no place better in Vegas comes too healthy menu. Literally they breakdown the calories on just about every menu item. Offer Build Your Own Custom Meal pick your proteins, greens, grains, and sauces. Again they have everything broken down too calories. It was my first time daunting too pick choose as my first taste. I kind of in the mood of burger so went with the Ostrich Burger and try so got the 7 Vegetable Broccoli Cheese Soup. 

The soup was good. It nothing Wow factor but overall solid soup. It nice creamy base soup but had nice thickness and full body with the cheese (assume cheddar they use. The color really nice. Times order any vegetable soup not have that vibrant or look like vegetable. Soup was right on. Nice HOT!!

The Ostrich Burger was delicious. I believe one first times having it. It lean meat. So thinking might be dried out but still moist and had nice flavor. The garnishes of lettuce and tomatoes really fresh looking added too my burger. The sides lot too choose from but went with the fried tofu. I scared at first. I enjoy tofu but not seasoned right just bland. The fried tofu was hit for me. It had nice seasonings on the outside and enjoy the aioli dipping sauce for them. They also offer Bison as protein. I see that in my future...

They cook everything too order so takes time but very much worth the wait. The only thing not fan of is the interior is REALLY boring. I understand still relatively new but plain white walls all around and not much of vibe inside. It loses appeal waiting but once you get your food more then MAKES up for it. It kind of pricey menu. Still not going too hold me back try more of the menu."}
{"text":"What can I say about Greens and Proteins?? I can tell you always been fan and this marks the third location in Vegas. I can tell you that every location the food has been spot on. They have a nice diversity of healthy options, whole create your own menu section, options for smoothies really enjoy, and never had bad meal. I ended up getting the Turkey Club Wrap with tofu fries. I think might have been the first time getting wrap. The best parts about it was instead of the normal wrap went with the spinach wrap. Talk about giving the wrap not only different flavor and look! I thought was prefect compliment for the whole dish. It had ample amount of turkey and love the dressing mixed in with the greens some fresh tomato. It nice size wrap one that filling. The tofu fries. Fried tofu especially hard tofu. Beautiful thing. It not only healthier but taste better then fries, Not at all greasy. It crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I could order whole basket of fries if I cold. The seasoning they out on the tofu is addicting.

You can tell not only from the sign that just opened plus get first review. LOL! It feels new, smells new, and things that tradition with the signage and logo. I believe this is the only location that the menu its electronic. I know the smoothies looked even more tasty. It rolls over couple times or least once. Each time keep showing different smoothie on the menu. It making me thirsty waiting or thinking about what am going order for lunch. I like the menu. They sell different nutrition bars Q-West bars to couple other brands. The cucumber water nice touch. Me not really fan of but hear it not only healthy but not many places that offer it. I would say probably about the same size as the other two locations. 

The service nothing but five stars for me. They greeted us right after entering, offered help with the menu if needed it, friendly, and love the positive vibes. The best part about third location is super close to the house. So now truly if ever need Greens and Proteins fix literally bike down the street or five min drive. Nice option too have in life!! =))))"}
{"text":"Their food and smoothies are great to have after a good workout!! Their fruits/veggies are fresh not frozen!! :) I actually had to ask them to remake my smoothie because it was kind of runny - but the second one they remade for me was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I had the vegan burger and I'm not normally a fan of anything vegan but this burger hit the spot. The prices are little bit pricey but not to bad. The atmosphere is pretty hip and trendy. I definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Out with my vegan food companion so options were limited. I assumed we were going to munch sugary lettuce, force down processed fake meats and cheeses and maybe power through weird dense bread. Being in this mindset, Greens and Proteins was a pleasant surprise. Nicely decorated yet still casual. Warning: watering system for the wall plants make a startling sound.

Parking is a piece of cake. It's in the same plaza as the athletic club and starbucks.

The ordering system is like Jason's Deli. Order/pay then they give you a number. Then they bring your food to you. They bus the tables too so don't awkwardly stand holding your refuse while darting your eyes around like I did.

I ordered a small caesar salad. It was huge. I couldn't finish it. It was standard taste. Also had a green ginger limeade. It was a whopping $5.99. It was dense, flavorful, refreshing and pleasant. But the thing I have to come back for are the \"tofu fries.\" They were thick, fried strips of tofu. Not caked in batter. Not oily. Just dusted in spice. 

The only downsides were weird meathead customers and it's a little expensive. You should try it!"}
{"text":"Told about this place from fellow gym mates...turns out they were right. Excellent food and good service. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good healthy food, fast friendly service,and right by the gym, what else do you want?"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go if you're looking for something healthy and relatively quick. I had the emu burger, and it was awesome, and the juices were really outstanding. I really like that they post all of the calories on the menu so you know what's in your food. The con, it's really quite pricey, 6+ $ for smoothies/drinks, and sandwiches start at about 10$. It would be easy to have a 25$ lunch by yourself here. Noticed they are however vegan, vegetarian and HCG diet friendly."}
{"text":"Ok here's my review after 4 times eating here....the owner was genius for putting it in a place where after a workout....its this or Starbucks....and giving that extra closing time for late night snacks after strength training....BUT HOWEVER....that's how I got caught here more than I would like to.i give 3 stars for location,hours,menu,and decor....I DO NOT GIVE more stars for the over priced UNDER flavored meals I've had...Tofu fries....PERFECTO'....juices & smoothies...nothing special and go raw cafe bears them with drinks by a long shot....the food costs way too much money to have to go home and re flavor. Rumor has it....don't quote me....they cook vegan dishes on the same equipment as meat dishes without cleaning....I DO NOT KNOW if this is 100% true,but I've heard and read about it too much to not mention. I'm trying the veggie burger right now and hopeful it stands up to its price range. I really want to love this image....the harvest kale salad was a joke,veggie pizza (vegan) decent,but over priced. Please owner.....step your game up...I want to be yur fav customer....I need you lol"}
{"text":"First time here today as we just moved up north and after running many errands for the house, needed some food. The menu is a bit intimidating for first timers, but the girls at the register were extremely helpful!  BF ordered the chicken tortilla soup and a cheese quesadilla. I had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries with a watermelon strawberry juice. Everything was delicious and filling. So much so that I did not have dinner and we ate about 2pm.  We will definitely be back as there are sooooo many other things I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Heaven for health fanatics who are also food enthusiasts! Conveniently located next to the LVAC and off 215, Greens & Proteins has delicious drinks, snacks, and meals for any time of the day. This casual restaurant is fitting for dine-in or take-out. 

There's so many options here that cater to ALL of your dietary needs and preferences-- you name it, they [probably] can do it! I LOVE their BBQ Chicken Pizza and also like their chicken cheese steak wrap and turkey burger with jicama or sweet potato fries. There's a good selection of smoothies and the Green Shake is another one of my favorites.

This location has indoor and patio seating available. Indoor usually is more quiet (I sometimes even do work here) and the patio is next to Starbucks' patio which is a bit loud but still adds to the atmosphere. If you're unable to make it out to this location, don't worry, there's other locations sprinkled all around Las Vegas valley area!"}
{"text":"delicious healthy food.  worth a try if you're coming from lvac and don't want to ruin your whole workout!"}
{"text":"As an update, the manager did call and spoke with me about it. He seemed sincere in trying to resolve the issue. We did order last week online again without issue, in fact, they gave us 'extra' on the drink since we added protein and it wouldn't all fit in the glass. Have ordered protein everytime and have never had that happen, it was a nice surprise. Changed my rating here to three stars for overall experience seemingly getting better."}
{"text":"Love their food. Can't go wrong there for any food fan & healthy eating. I like the fact their selection can be a part of my breakfast lunch or dinner. Now they have convenient locations. Making it even easy to dine there!"}
{"text":"We eat at this location pretty often, the service is always fast and friendly. The clientele for the most part seems to be people coming after a work out at the LVAC across the way so the dress code is super casual. 
The build your own protein plate is the way to go for us. The salmon is always cooked perfect but the sizes of the pieces of salmon can vary a lot! I always get sliced avocado and mashed sweet potato as my sides with the balsamic dressing. Highly recommend!
For breakfast, the French toast is a favorite with my kids... they are crusted with granola. Yum!
I have tried a few of their smoothies and have enjoyed them all. 
The only downside is the prices. Be prepared to pay the price to eat healthier!"}
{"text":"Lots of menu options and they give you a good filling amount of food.  Wraps, burgers, soups even lots of breakfast options and so many healthy and vegan options.  Great place I hope more locations open up."}
{"text":"Courteous staff and an owner who \"loves\" food.  Food that is both delicious and nutritious"}
{"text":"Great food, just wish the prices were a little better. Maybe im cheap?? 

The cheesesteak cabbage wrap is a fav and we also like the build your own meals."}
{"text":"Kayla was extremely helpful and i was not sure on what i wanted to get and she walked me through not only her favorite meals but meals that would benefit my health. Definitely 5 stars from me and i will be coming more often"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this location to open up since the announcement earlier this year! I was so thrilled when they finally opened because it is near my work. I was unaware of the opening and luckily my coworker called to ask to see when they opened and luckily enough, it just happened to be the day when they had the soft opening.

I have been working in the food and beverage industry for a few years and I know how things work when a restaurant opens up. It has only been a couple of weeks since this location opened up and I have to say that they have been doing a great job accommodating to the clientele, This location is near a business center where major companies are located including: William Hill, Hakkassan and multiple law firms and physician firms. This location is busy! It may not be near a gym unlike the other two locations, but it is still pretty busy. I am impressed with the way the staff is working so hard to maintain great service for a new spot that has barely opened for less than a month. I have to give a shout out to Daniel and the rest of the team who constantly give their best to making a great dining experience!

I have been to the other locations and I have to say that the serving size in the location seems more than the other two. I feel like I am actually getting my money's worth here! I love building my own menu or ordering the food from the menu. The service, the food and the quality is consistent from the other two locations. There has never been a bad experience with me from the food or service. I am very happy that there is finally a location near where I live and where I work!

So far, this location is working very hard for a business to open up less than a month. Service is great, food tastes delicious and is consistent throughout. I know I will continuously go here!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Just great healthy food for a very good price. Most of the juice drinks are great and the bison patties are awesome!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today to have a nice lunch since a week in Vegas never really lends to healthy eating.  The decor and atmosphere of the place was quite nice.  I had a buffalo strip meal and my wife had the Asian chicken wrap on lettuce.  She really enjoyed the wrap but the buffalo strips were extremely small in portion and did not have much seasoning.  The price was extremely high for the amount of food that was given.  All and all, a nice place for a quick and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Place is really good and pretty healthy! They are really friendly here and extremely efficient. This is definitely one of my go to spots! Tyler is the man here!

Some of my favorites:

* Bison Cheesesteak Wrap (Spinach wrap) - My Favorite
* Chicken/Turkey Bacon/Avocado wrap - so good
* Green Shake - Really Good
* Salmon here is really good too"}
{"text":"Their green vegie drink was amazing!  The atmosphere is was awesome with free wifi and lots of outlets!"}
{"text":"My absolute new favorite place to go.  This is even better than Rachel's Kitchen (sorry - I still adore you).  Ingredients are clearly fresh and there is even a bit of love put into the sandwiches.

Big thumbs up for the calorie counts and online ordering.

I first thought this was a national chain as their branding and menu is spot on.  Wouldn't surprise me at all if Greens and Proteins takes over the world!"}
{"text":"Greens n Proteins W. Flamingo & Grand Canyon  

After coming here a few times & not being disappointed 
I feel like it's the least I can do is to leave a review. 
Following along with the rest of the health nut community I've decided to start counting those  calories & macros. In my pursuit of this fun filled journey of Greens n Proteins I've found that when i can combine healthy food with flavor I become happy. From Juices to shakes . Wraps to bison cheese steaks potato fries to Quinoa Salads. Its definitely a place I leave feeling satisfied and not disgusted with myself! Their service has been great the 4-5 times I've been there. It can get busy at times and waiting for your food for 15 mins  can definitely be a possibility.

{"text":"After days of gorging on Vegas buffets and other unhealthy foods, we were craving something  healthy after a workout. We stumbled across this place and were delighted. They have four different kinds of pizza crust--we opted for thin crust with BBQ chicken. We also got a wellness shake, which was very good."}
{"text":"I went with my family, My dad found a piece of metal in his food. He could choke and something horrible could happen. First, the incompetent assistant manager answered me that it is normal to find a piece of metal in the food.What kind of place is this!!! And second, she lied saying that she was the manager trying to cover up what happen. Be aware about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Paid my first visit to Greens and Proteins for a healthy bite to eat after a not so healthy day of eating. I ordered an order of the chicken satay and had managed to snag a few bites of my man's teriyaki chicken wrap. I wanted to try their smoothies or juices, but I convinced myself to settle with their complimentary cucumber water to drink. Frankly, I couldn't justify paying more for juice than I paid for my entrée. (Huge cheapo moment). 

I enjoyed my satay as it was a good amount of skewers and actually tasted like I had ordered them from a Thai restaurant. The wrap was okay... lacked a little flavor as I couldn't taste any sauce, but it wasn't bad. I liked the tofu fries I ordered along with it. 

One of the best parts was seeing all the pre/post workout LVAC members who entered and exited as we ate. This not only gave me more motivation to get my booty in the gym, but also showed that this business was thriving and providing great, healthy options for those in town. I love seeing a place with active \"regulars.\" 

On my next visit, I hope not to be too cheap to not try the juices and smoothies. :)"}
{"text":"My smoothie was good but the sandwich I ordered wasn't seasoned well and neither were the tofu fries. However, I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Newer restaurant to the area, I had to try since their motto is \"Healthy\". 
I had the skinny chef salad with Ranch dressing - good salad for lunch. I got the small portion, I can only imagine how large the large portion is, so really impressed with the sizes. I'll definitely be going back to try more of the food and the juices. 
I do like the fact that instead of sugar, the sweetener choice for the juices is Agave Nectar. Not quite paleo, but a better option than sugar. 
My only comment is I wish they had a grass-fed burger and organic veggie options."}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious! Customer service is good and the food is passable. Although, my boyfriend ordered the Buffalo Chicken Strips and the sauce was a little too spicy. I also preferred more berries on the Summer Berry Salad I ordered. (But), regardless of our personal preference on the food, it was well worth the money we spent. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Healthy never tasted so good! I'm still not sure I didn't consume 1000 calories it was so delicious. The ingredients are so fresh, totally chill atmosphere, and the prices were great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and consistent. Will continue to go again & again. Anything bison here is on point lol"}
{"text":"GAINZ HEAVEN! So jealous of Las Vegas for having this little gem, and especially jealous of LVAC members for having this place in the same center! If only my own gym had a nearby spot that offered even HALF of what Green & Proteins offers, I would be happy. The menu is outstanding, carrying more options than a girl can handle. Each item lists the nutritional facts of the meal, ensuring you know exactly what you are feeding your body! I couldn't ask for more. My muscles are happy and my tastebuds are definitely not complaining!"}
{"text":"I had high expectation traveled 10 minutes in taxi there n back $30 round trip wasn't worth it at all- staff were nice smoothies good food disgusting left feeling yuck.
Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I must say, This place is BETTER than Waba Grill!!! Service here is fast no wait at all! Wish there was one out here in California. Tried this place thanks to a friend and I fell in love with bison cheesesteak wrap! Definitely worth more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a healthy meal and know that I put something good in my body.  Bison burger with tofu is what I usually order , it's a bit pricy tho ."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with an amazing concept fusing super healthy organic with a medium type /Upper class-fast food Service. They have multiple locations however I have found the flamingo location the most consistent when it comes accurate meal preparation. The majority of the menu is set up so that you can pick your own protein greens and carbs individually and is very nice for people that like food cooked their particular way. You can tell when the owner is not at the store location-However if you bring it to their attention that they messed up on your order they give you a wonderful attitude and often replace the meal/but always try to make good."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins overall is always great, but the Flamingo location is really excellent.  The staff is always very nice, friendly and helpful with the menu.  The dining area is clean, stocked and well kept.  The chairs are a little uncomfortable, but that's only because I'd prefer to lay on a couch after my workouts."}
{"text":"Went to Greens and protein last night wanted a protein Burger lettuce wrap they were out of lettuce last time they were out of avocado they were out of ingredients on pizzas that they served no cilantro for the barbecue chicken pizza they change pizza crust it's terrible I got the build your meal with the bison burger they destroyed it$16 wow"}
{"text":"You come here for a reason...lifestyle food that is not available at most places.  It is no coincidence that it is located next to LVAC.  Greens and Proteins has lots of high protein meats, low-fat options, vegetarian options, vegan options, good grains, and gluten free options to fit several lifestyle diets.

I am a fan of their buffalo meat steak & cheese wrap and their green shake specifically, but if you're looking for the types of food offered here it is easy to find something on the menu.  They also provide caloric and fat content info on their menu.

Don't come here if you are not into lifestyle food.  It will most likely disappoint.  There are plenty of tasty items for all types of eater, but you're paying a little more here because of the type of food.  Also, several of the healthy options are a bit bland...ie jicama fries.  It is still a solid place that is filling a niche and doing it pretty well."}
{"text":"LOVE this location!! Amanda and her team are fantastic. The food is always awesome and prompt, the place is always clean and customers always look happy! Wish this place was in California, but it's a perk of coming to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the options here! 

The food quality and flavor is really amazing! The only think I need to mention is that some of the time I order there my orders are not always right. Even so, I will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"Delicious spot for lunch - lots of healthy options with easy modifications to get it just how you like it.  Perfect for those of us who are careful or picky about what we eat and often annoy servers with special requests. Everything I tried (from both my order and my husbands) was fantastic! Don't skip the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Always a good choice if you're looking for a healthier meal option. I got the buffalo chicken wrap and it was delicious! I get their smoothies as well and they are great."}
{"text":"Service was slow, eggs not crispy at edges and firm in center when ordering over hard.  I love oatmeal and this place charged more for it than starbucks next door.   Next doors starbucks had better tasting n consistency oatmeal at half the price.  The plates are large, but the food rather bland.   I just can't see eating here again.  I can see eating next door at Starbucks again.  Also, don't check in on yelp here.  The service are oblivious to the discount.  Overpriced place with bad food and a nice name.  I think it would have been healthier to not eat than eat here, despite the nice healthy name."}
{"text":"Awesome place for healthy and flavorful food. I usually get the Wellness or the Green Ginger Limeade drinks. There food is a bit pricy, but worth it. I'm so glad they finally came to the northwest!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love to hit this place up after a workout. Food is clean and I don't feel heavy even after a burger. Love the tofu fries and complimentary cucumber water. Food does take a while, especially take out."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place long prior to actually eating there as I'm a foodie and when I learned my brother was to be moving to Vegas, I immediately did a restaurant search cause I need to know places to eat when I visit, right?! Ha!

Any who... When I did in fact visit, my brother said \"I have a great lunch spot I know you will like... Greens & Proteins!\" - I pretended to act like I didn't know what the place was all about but let's be real, I ALREADY KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING TO ORDER! 

Sadly, when we got there, I learned they didn't have ostrich on the menu anymore (I was looking at an old menu on yelp), and their bison is no grass-finished so I mixed that option and went for my staple, salmon. As for sides, I got asparagus, sweet potatoes and added on avocado! 

Our food arrived maybe 12 minutes later, and looks amazing.... Granted I thought my Salmon portion looked a little small (but I didn't say anything). My brother and his fiancé got bison burgers and my husband got the Cali Chicken Wrap. No one had any problems with their Food. I was initially a bit concerned for my husband because he pretty much hates everything he eats unless it's chick fil a but he did not complain at all and ACTUALLY ADMITTED to the wrap being good! He also got a peanut butter shake (that he was initially very skeptical of because when it arrived to him it looked slightly green), and sucked that baby dry!

If and when we visit my brother again, this spot will definitely be on the list of places to eat at, for a quick and lighter lunch (depending on what you order) as I am a huge fan of \"build your own plate\" restaurants!"}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins.... So many great things to say about this company in general. They have a versatile menu, full of smart, clean eating food, AND they cook/prepare it all accurately. None of that over cooked broccoli or dried out chicken. The location on rainbow actually is my favorite bc the staff there is SO friendly, but this location has pretty quick service most the time. And I think their infused water is so awesome. Like icing on the cake, lol."}
{"text":"I just love this place! It's within walking distance of my office, which makes it super convenient, so naturally, I am here quite a bit. Without fail, Daniel always welcomes me with the happiest most genuine attitude. Today, Maria took my order and it was not the standard order, in fact I just needed salad dressing because I packed a salad for lunch today and forgot the dressing. (Stupid Monday's!)
Anyway, I told Maria to just charge me whatever I needed to be charged and I guess because I'm such a regular here they were just going to give me the dressing for free. Of course, I do not like to take anything for free so I purchased a fabulous ginger green limeade:)))) mmmmm!!!! 
So then... As I was leaving, I started typing this review and oblivious me, I left my wallet on one of the tables! The staff (John and Daniel) knew the company I worked for and they went completely out of their way to call me!!! 
Just amazing people all around and I can't say enough good things about them!!"}
{"text":"Alright my first review from my phone! First off thanks yelp, makes it so much easier. Anyways back to the review. One of my favorite things about the Henderson area is the amount of amazing different dining options. I literally could grub off Eastern for a month straight and not get bored. Greens and Proteins is a unique healthier fresh option of just about anything you normally eat. They offer fresh juices and smoothies with everything from kale, to watermelon, pineapple and wheat grass. They also have elk and ostrich burgers and bison cheesesteaks. My personal favorites are the wellness drink (a veggie/fruit mixture) and the berry parfait. That comes with yogurt, house made granola, dried and fresh fruit. There are breakfast lunch and dinner options available, and they come with sides like jicama or tofu fries. This place has made eating healthy so much easier. The staff is polite and educated in the foods they offer. There is also a \"spa water\" which is a cucumber lemon infused water. YUM. Honestly, I plan on being the duchess to this place very soon. 
Extra: check in on yelp for a $1 off :)"}
{"text":"Menu descriptions are poorly written and inaccurate.  Case in point Jicama Fries are just strips of raw jicama.  We ordered extra as it sounded like something new and worth a try.  Cold jicama strips did not come close to meeting expectations."}
{"text":"Okay so I came back to Greens and Proteins. Not much has changed which is a good thing. The staff were again friendly and informative. They do really try to have the answers to their food. I kind of stumped them today but it doesn't take away at all from how I feel about this establishment. The only thing they didn't know was whether or not there soy products are organic. I think as a health restaurant that should be something that should be known. But other than that people were great. The food came out hot for the hot food and cold for the cold food. It was cooked to the right temperature. The food does taste fresh. The food is always good. The restaurant is clean. Even the bathroom is clean. I kind of use the bathroom as a way to make sure the entire place is clean. If they keep their bathroom clean they for damn sure will keep their restaurant clean. The only reason I don't give them a five star is because they aren't the best food I have ever had. But damn it they are good! I would recommend this place to everyone. Specifically the one on Grand Canyon and Flamingo. That's the only one I've been to. Keep up the good work Greens and Proteins! You always satisfy me!"}
{"text":"Ostrich burger was amazing! I highly recommend it, notwithstanding its price. The sweet potato fries are well worth the upgrade! I particularly like how they wrap the pickle in baggie so it doesn't get the burger's bun or any of the fries soggy. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Paid $20 for a GMO soy breakfast wrap (only vegan option for breakfast) and a non-organic cup of juice. Pretty disappointing for a place call GREENS & Proteins. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was good. 

Friendly staff, good location, easy parking. 

I ordered the burger, I'm not 100% it's grass fed beef but it was good. 

Daughter had hummus with pita bread, good as well. 

Husband ordered salmon, he said it was ok, and a green healthy smoothie, as good as a green smoothie can be. 


Been here a few times and always satisfied with what we ordered and the service. 

Thank you greens and proteins."}
{"text":"Wellness drink was delicious. I also had the greek breakfast and the green shake, both were great!
The manager needs to work on his customer service, but all of the other employees were nice.
Overall good place, something for everyone, vegas, vegitarian, or not."}
{"text":"I am glad this place opened less than a mile from me. I am so happy. More healthy alternatives."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a Pilates class down the street. I love it! I wish It was closer to where I live. I legit copied the tofu and jicama fries at home. They were soooo good and truly an awesome alternative to reg fries. Yummy cucumber water too....and its free!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming to Greens and Proteins. They get me lol. My create your own meal is slightly complicated but they nail it every time, regardless of which location."}
{"text":"The Eastern location is way better. It was freezing cold in there! I hate when restaurants are too cheap to turn on the heat. I don't enjoy eating my meals bundled up in my winter coat and still be freezing. My soup came out thick as I like it, but the tofu fries were way thinner than the Eastern location and one of them was half the length. See the pic I posted. 

There was also a customer who seemed to be a regular harassing all the women who walked in. Then, the customer walked into the kitchen and just started talking to the kitchen staff. He had no hairnet on so it's possible his hair was falling off into the food, then he just grabbed his own food from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Easy way for the average busy body to still eat clean without having to cook at home. Awesome selections!"}
{"text":"All my reviews are of places that I have been many many times. Since I am only reviewing my top spots in Vegas I feel obligated to do so. My friends trust that if I review a place and it get's five stars it must be great. 

I have only been here a handful of times, but this by far is my favorite health food hangout now and will be checking in many times. You will see many campers with computers because it offers free wi/fi. I might start bring my laptop. 

What I love about this place; I can build my own meal for 10 bucks. I order either chicken breast or the Filet. The chicken breast is so juicy and seasoned nicely for about 8 bucks. Filet is cooked to order and is amazingly good for 15 bucks. Now each build your own meal comes with a generous portion of a veggie and a gain. I do the broccoli and brown rice. No sauce for me. But sauce is available.

Don't let me review fool you into thinking it is just builder your own meal. They have one of the best tasting health pizzas in town (i order the gluten free crust).  Honestly if someone can show me better I am up for the challenge.  

And of course the have the traditional health juices and wraps.

The coolest thing about this place is the water jug next to the soda fountain. Fresh Lemons and Cucumbers added to filter water. It is so good! Ask for a cup at check-out it is free. 

OK friends go and try this place and let me know what you think :-)"}
{"text":"I like the BYOM. It makes it so simple to have a clean meal. The fact that the menu is actually on the decent side of the calorie count is awesome."}
{"text":"The wellness drink is top notch.
Bison wrap and the burger are excellent.
It is a \"got to go to\" if you're looking to eat clean and are in the area. 
My kids eat here with us and they enjoy it.
 Thanks to LVAC being near by the customers have a tad of the \"look at me I'm eating organic\" douchey feel but it makes for good people watching.
The staff works fast and are pretty nice. The guy posted up at the counter (manager/owner) keeps things running smooth. A+."}
{"text":"Just went to greens and proteins because it was recommended by my neighbor. First of all the place is spotless and the staff is friendly. I was skeptical because healthy food tends to be poor in taste but this is not the case at G&P. The chocolate and peanut butter shake was excellent and I had no clue there were vegetables mixed in. Then the meal came out and wow the whole wheat French toast was scrumptious ! This place has completely changed my mind about health food tasting like cardboard that's for sure. The owner himself even came out to greet me and ask how my meal was. I give five stars for the original recipe, the cleanliness of the establishment and the fact that the owner has direct involvement in the operation. This is always indicates that someone takes pride in what they do and wants the best quality products/services for their customers. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Really nice and healthy place to have a meal, their food is done fast but, there's always a but right! Lol, their prices are a little steep, but I guess it comes with the kind of food you're ordering which is some of the most nutritious and healthy for the restaurants in this area, I highly recommend their bison burger and the bbq chicken pizza! The atmosphere is quite pleasing and inviting, just good vibes overall!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been back so I thought I'd give it another shot before my workout. 

There was a gentleman behind the counter instead of a woman. He was nice and was able to make my order vegan. He was also kind enough to sub out a non vegan sauce for one I would like. 

I ordered a veggie burger without the bun since the bun wasn't vegan and a gluten free vegan bun was $3 more. After consuming the burger, the bun wouldn't have made a difference. It was bland and...well bland. The tofu fries on the other hand were amazing! Add the BBQ sauce and wow! 

Service was a lot better from my first visit last year. I was asked if I needed anything else after my food was delivered and I asked if silverware was in a specific area. The gentleman then offered to grab them for me instead. The staff seemed more cheerful than what I experienced last year.
However I can see why they would be Debbie downers. They have people coming in asking for sparkling water in a different language. Just say sparkling water! 

Overall, this visit was better than the first. And to the lady who was asked to leave because your dog wasn't a service dog, there's still no sign saying service dogs only.  Remember, it's a food establishment...with an open juice bar. I'm sure most people would like their juices without animal hair."}
{"text":"The food is good, pricey but good. What's sad is they're rude as hell. I've had 3 negative experiences here and 1-2 good ones. Called in an order for a turkey burger, they gave me an angus once that i realized once I started eating. I called to double check & they didn't bother to care. Came in today a few minutes before they closed (I honestly forgot they closed at 5pm on a Saturday) instead of attending us they straight up we're like \"sorry were closed\" then close your doors maybe?? Another time they closed 2 hours before the time they said so, I had to drive back. Y'all hella annoying & it's catching up to you guys. Get it tf together no food is worth it"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Can't believe how good the smoothies taste considering all the veggies in it.

We have had all of the following: green smoothie (recommend!), watermelon smoothie, chocolate veggiechino (realllly good), green leaf berry blast.

Breakfast burrito, Greek scramble, Multigrain Protein Pancakes with Bananas & Pecans (awesome! Can't believe how fluffy they were in consideration), Southwest Tofu & Chorizo Burrito, Real Deal Oatmeal (this was really nice too!), and lastly, but not least, the Margherita Pizza (this tasted really good, got the thin crust, tasted really fresh). 

I would just like to say that we did not have this all at one time. This was with three people on multiple trips! Everything tasted good but these are the ones that stood out and I would recommend: green smoothie, chocolate veggiechino, watermelon smoothie, the banana pancakes, real deal oatmeal, and the margherita pizza!"}
{"text":"I love how whatever meal plan you are on, you can find something to eat. I always get my grilled chicken, sweet potatoes, and asparagus with a side of Buffalo sauce or balsamic glaze.  If you are in the mood for a green smoothie I recommend the \"green limeade\"."}
{"text":"I love this place! I got the Greek scramble, a green ginger limeade and a bison cheesesteak. Devin made the limeade and you could taste the fresh limes bursting with flavor.
The Greek scramble came with pita bread and was topped with feta cheese and kalamata olives. I had never had anything like it before but wanted to try something different. What a great choice.

All the staff is super friendly and there is quick service from FOH to getting your food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after finding out that they are not organic!! I thought a place called greens and proteins would be an organic focused place! Don't be mistaken people!"}
{"text":"Tried something off the HCG menu.  It was Good.  I look forward to trying other items.  Very clean and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here definitely not the last time! It's the best vege food I've had since coming to LV!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to each lunch! It's walking distance from my office and the food is amazing! Great quality and healthy. The staff is very nice and the owners always make sure that the customers are happy. Highly recommend greens and proteins!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I fell I love with the Summer Berry Spinach Salad with a side of tofu fries! I'm not even vegetarian. Every time I come here I feel guilty for not being in my gym clothes. I wish there was one next to every Starbucks so I could eat healthy everywhere I travel."}
{"text":"Had the summer berry salad with chicken and it was delicious! My only complaint is that the large salad was not that large and $16 so it is a bit pricey but everything on the menu looked so good, I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I'm super stoked about having a healthier alternative to choose from especially when you're on the go. I come here at least once a week and my favorite drink is Green Ginger Limeade. Thank you to G&P for coming to the North side of town"}
{"text":"One of the best and freshest food restaurants you will have. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap w/ sweet potato fries, the wrap w/there homemade ranch was delicious and filling the sweet potato fries were very yummy the customer service is great! Thank you Marilyn and Ceasar!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the other posters about the bland food.  Decided to check this place out for the first time with a friend and unfortunately, can't see myself returning.  I ordered a rough cut roma tomato salad and the tortilla soup.  My friend ordered what looked like a mix of steamed veggies and rice (steamed broccoli, kale, mixed squash/zucchini).   The salad they brought out for me was mainly radicchio and frisee (the red/purple lettuce and the light green \"fuzzy\" lettuce just in case you're not sure what that is); two of the most bitter greens that I'm least fond of.  The dressing was a bitter vinaigrette with lemon, I believe.  The tomato slices appeared to have been sitting out for a while; not fresh at all.  There were some spinach leaves thrown in along with some cucumber.  I took a bite and was hit with bland bitterness.  At first, I thought there just wasn't dressing but the guy explained that there was dressing on it.  The tortilla soup came out and did not look like soup - it appeared very thick, almost like orange hummus.  I dipped in and it tasted very sweet, like pumpkin, without any type of \"mexican/tortilla\" flavor.  I couldn't force myself to eat it although I was starving.  I told my friend she should try the soup to see if it was just me.  She seemed very hesitant by the look of it.  She took a dip and stated, \"There is no flavor....it's just...sweet?\"  I didn't quite understand what I had ordered.  Her meal came out; just steamed veggies and brown rice.  I tried some and it was fine but I can't fathom paying the $13 for this when it is one of the easiest things to make at home....steamed veggies and rice.  I lost out on $12 myself.  I couldn't eat my food and soon pushed it to the side so I could just focus on hang time and not the hunger pangs in my stomach.  When I left, I came home and made an amazing organic salad, topped with LOTS of avocado.  They should hire me to improve their salad menu. :)"}
{"text":"Well .. Even tho it's a wee bit pricy .. I was happy... We ordered a margherita pizza and a bison burger .. I'd order the pizza again for sure.. topped it off with a delicious watermelon/ strawberry  cocktail which was really refreshing yet $6 for a drink is a bit much ... maybe if  it's organic... but I'm not sure if it is...   we will be back !!! It's nice to have a healthy option !!!"}
{"text":"I give them a four out of five for customer service. Every time I've eaten there they've been more than accommodating. This time in particular a friend was visiting from out of town and drove from across town because he's vegan and wanted some decent food. This location was open a little later so we drove here. Even though it was about 9:15 and the close the dining room at 9:30, they let us stay and eat. Which was very nice. I try not to push anyone's buttons in the food industry, I know they want to go home after work too. So we tried to hurry. Thank you so much for allows us to have dinner! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"After a workout, I wanted something clean and easy to I decided to come here! I've never tried it before but it's so close to my box that I figured \"now is the perfect time!\" 

Upon walking in, the employees are super nice and the restaurant is extremely clean and simple. The menu is placed on the wall and there's also paper menus as well. I wanted to try their jicama fries and their tofu fries and a bunch of my friends recommended that I try the drinks as well!

Their jicama fries have a nice crunch to them and not too much spice or seasoning so I added lime juice to it but next time, I think I'll add chili to it to give it a little kick. The tofu fries were delicious!! Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- definitely not starchy like potatoes but they were good. The seasoning on the outside of the fries was delicious! It wasn't too salty or too spicy or anything but just right. The strawberry watermelon drink I had had a scoop of protein in it and it made it into a creamy shake- perfect as a dessert and a way to get fruits and protein into my body after the workout. Stephan had the margarita pizza and it was delicious too. The crust was nice and crispy and the sauce and cheese to pizza ratio was on point. 

Price wasn't too bad, the 6 pieces of tofu fries are $2.00 and the plateful of jicama fries are $4.00. Not bad considering I don't have to chop and peel to eat jicama. My smoothie drink was I think $5.99 but I added whey protein so it was an extra dollar. Not too bad for clean eating food.

All in all, we will definitely be coming back here more often!!"}
{"text":"Vegan, gf & raw! So excited! 
THOSE WITH CELIAC'S/GLUTEN INTOLERANCE BE CAREFUL: see below

I was very excited to discover this chain had opened up on the southwest part of town. They are ingeniously located near LVAC, making it easy to get a healthy recovery meal after your workout. We ordered: Pumpkin spice chai latte, veggie garden burger, and bison burger. Total after tip= $38.10 (we took our food to go). A little on the high end $$$. Our food came out pretty quickly, but our smoothie took longer than expected. I was hoping to get that first and sip on that as an appetizer while we waited for our food. I don't know if they forgot about our smoothie or was just slow on making it. I did notice however, people after me get their drink before me, they also knew him on a first name basis and gave him the extra out of the blender in a separate cup. They should treat everyone as if they are a regular. Talk about not making me feel special. 

~Pumpkin Chai Tea Latte; Chai Tea, Pumpkin, Green Cabbage, Carrots, Butternut Squash, Flax Seeds, Ginger, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Walnuts, Agave Nectar. This was really good and very filling. Although the cabbage was pronounced, the smoothie was well balanced and tasted raw (the way I like it).

~Bison burger w/ jicama fries; choice of swiss or cheddar cheese, lettuce tomato and onion on a whole grain bun. He wished he got it with cheddar rather than swiss. \"Jicama fries\" are just sliced jicama lightly seasoned with what looks/tastes paprika. 

*Veggie garden burger; I was extremely excited because I'm a sucker for alfalfa sprouts. I asked the cashier if the veggie patty was gluten free, as I have had a difficult time finding a veggie patty that does not use \"wheat gluten\" as a binder. He asked someone on the cooking line, who I assume was a manager, and he said \"yes, it's gf, the patty is soy based protein\" I took their word for it and gambled the risk. Sure enough I think the veggie patty is glutenous so BEWARE to those with celiac's/gluten intolerance. I got sick, as I do from eating or cross-contaminating with gluten/wheat. I have yet to bring my concern to the attention of the staff. Moving forward, the burger was eh-okay. My gluten free bun was hard (it's difficult to get a soft, buoyant bun using gluten free flour, especially if you're taking your item to go. In the future I will dine in. I ordered my burger with tofu fries. I was told that they dust the tofu blocks with rice flour and fry it in corn oil, so the oil should not be a point of cross contamination, as there isn't anything else with regular flour going into the oil. My burger came with the sprouts, bibb lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I also added vegan cheese, it's shredded.

We also added avocado to our sandwiches ($0.75/burger) for a quarter of an avocado (rip off). I don't mind paying extra for modifications, but make it worth my while and not be so skimpy! At least give me a half an avocado for that price, so that I can have it in every bite as opposed to just half my burger. I was charged extra for vegan cheese, again this would be fine, but there was less than a teaspoon sprinkled on my burger, with a $1.00 up-charge.

Although the food is pricey, it's raw, healthy, and typically quick, right up my alley. I will be back because there is not many others around like this and to inform them of my gf veggie patty concerns. There are just a few \"tweeks\" they need to adjust before they get the 5th star from me.I hope they properly label their menu on their website and physical menu so gluten free & vegan items are clearly marked. Just remember they do not operate out of a certified gluten free kitchen, but it seems that for the most part they handle issues like cross contamination okay.

Service was exceptional. There was a constant line (with one cashier) at 3:00pm. He was very nice and patient with me since I had a lot of questions."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The staff seemed like it was their first day. I waited 20 minutes for a turkey burger. Then they didn't make my juice, I asked 3 staff members for my drink all said yes and never returned. I had to finally ask for a refund. This place is amateur at best, I didn't expect 5 star service but I expected prompt service and good food! Never again!"}
{"text":"Sitting here fully relishing in my vegan/gluten free crusted leftover, magical tasting, mouth watering, insane vegetarian pizza, for BREAKFAST! What the fck on this being seriously my favorite... Here's the greatness of out-of-the box divine eating, dip the pizza in the Russian sauce that comes with the tofu-yummy-\"fries,\" order the sauce on the side and quadruple dip away... Plus the exquisitely stunning goddess Mariah took my order and is always so elegant in customer service.
FOOD PORN in its finest!"}
{"text":"Drive by this place all the time.. decided to check it out today!

I ordered take out for lunch for my husband and I. I asked the girl at the register what she recommended and/or the most popular dish, she didn't have much to say except asking me what I was hungry for..  I wanted to know what there top seller was, no answer. At that point another woman interjected and took over my order. 

For my husband, I ordered the Turkey Club as a wrap. For myself, I ordered the Grilled Vegetable wrap. I mentioned I eat a lot of grilled vegetable sandwiches, which she replied but you haven't had ours .... I did have it today, and will not be ordering it again. The wrap was soggy.. not much flavor to the vegetables that were not crunchy but overcooked. The beans were tasty along with the cilantro pesto, however there was only a dab or two put on it. 

For the sides, with a choice between tofu fries or jicama, I went with something different, tofu fries... different indeed.. I love tofu, but these were shaped like fish sticks and had the seasoning and taste of fish sticks you had as a child (not pleasant)
Next time, I'll go for the jicama. The woman that took my order, did say the sauce that you dip them in is good, and yes it was... I ended up putting it on my bland grilled veg. wrap. 

I also ordered the Thai Ginger soup, which I was told was made from scratch. 
It was flavorful, but could have used some salt to bring out the flavor more.. A little thick for a hot afternoon. 

I tasted my husbands Turkey Club and it was tasty. Maybe I'll order that the next time. 

The service was nice and friendly.. I will go back and give it another try... 
For a first time experience,  today's meal proved to me that if it good for you, then it doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"The location is a bit isolated from the center/strip but overall great to get away from the norm and people. The teriyaki chicken pizza is good but the chicken tasted a bit old; the breakfast yogurt needs more gogurt if felt like cereal with no milk. the girls at the counter were amazing. Bathrooms smell good and the location detailed cleaned."}
{"text":"I ordered through postmate two angus burgers, I live right down the street from the place, but I am 9 months pregnant with no car.
The food came cold, all mushy, really disappointed"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff are friendly and the service is quick. The green shake and Wellness drink are my favorite. Sometimes I'll customize my orders to change things up and G & P satisfies all my needs. It's nice to find a place that serves quality food."}
{"text":"Eat well and feel swell.

That is how I feel after every meal here! It is a really cute restaurant that is always packed and after you taste the food you understand why. The staff are professional and friendly. I have yet to find something that is not overly exciting to the tastebuds.

My go-to beverage of choice is the green ginger limeade. It is a drink that I crave all the time!

The latest food adventure was the spaghetti squash parm, and I will be back for more! I also highly recommend the veggie wrap. Not sure what is in the sauce but the first bite made me wish all vegetarian dishes tasted that good!"}
{"text":"Seriously Yummy Health Food. That's all you need to know. The Green Leaf Berry Blast Smoothie is my addiction and less than 250 Calories!"}
{"text":"Love this pace so much. It's great to know that I can order a healthy meal that will satisfy my belly but best of all my tastebuds. I usually order pick up. I literally live 5 mins away. I call before i leave the house and when i get there, BOOM! my food is ready. Service is fast, and i usually find parking right away out in front. The place inside has a good amount of seating. It's nice and bright inside. Staff is always super friendly & on point. Will continue to order from this place."}
{"text":"The service here is always wonderful but today was excellent. Chris gave some suggestions and was very very helpful. He also explained some menu options we were unsure of to try next time."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and accommodating to requests with orders but everything else is kind of blah"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place higher rating, but I can't. Here's why: I ordered some food last night to go. It was late, I had worked all day and didn't want to have make anything. My family decided to get some food as well as some drinks too. Keep in mind this was all vegan food. The burgers I got were quite bland and I did not enjoy the jicama fries at all. The pizza I ordered was made incorrectly. The watermelon strawberry drink I ordered was just bad. Not one person in my family liked it. And one drink was just flat out missing. I called them and they said \"oh it's right here\" but they had locked the doors behind me to close up and would not give me my last drink, even though I could see it in the counter through the window. I ordered through yelp, who tried to get a refund for me on my behalf, but this place would only refund me for 1 drink and the pizza. I got stuck paying for 2 terrible burgers and 1 terrible drink as well. Not cool.

I do really like their smoothie options though."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! 
I ordered a vegan burger, raw vegan pizza, and hummus and pita for my sister and I.
My sister is not vegan. 
She did not like the raw vegan pizza and George was so nice and professional. 
He explained to her if the food is not subpar that she can trade it out. 
He deserves a promotion! 
Thanks Greens&Proteins. 
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"You know...I'm really not sure what to really rate Greens and Proteins. I like it, it's different...but then again...I'm not too big of a fan. Maybe I need to go here more than once...but with the prices..maybe not. =/

Anyways...my boyfriend and I wanted to start eating healthier. We're not health freaks but we don't want to become obese one day either. He heard about this place through his co workers. The thought of \"making your own meal\" intrigued him so we were willing to give it a try. We walked in knowing their prices were on the higher end side.

We both decided to get the \"make your own meal\" plate. To sum it up, PORTIONS ARE SMALL. It was actually perfect for me because I get full easily anyways but for all you \"big eaters\"...be warned. This MAY NOT fill you up. Yes, it IS a healthy restaurant afterall. Yes, the whole point in small portions is because it is healthy for you. But I'm just saying....
 It may fill me up but PERSONALLY, it still left something for me to desire.

We also got two drinks. He got that green drink (sorry forgot the name of it but I've seen a lot of Yelpers get it) and I got the berry antioxidant smoothie. They tasted different...but a good different. Man....after drinking this, it puts Jamba Juice and Tropical Smoothie to shame. Greens and Proteins smoothie drinks tasted natural and healthy. You can tell it has natural ingredients and fresh fruits and veggies...unlike all the other sugar and crap that maybe be in Jamba and Tropical.

So why 3 stars and not a higher rating? 
-2 stars for the price. It seriously pays to be healthy. =/ I think with 2 drinks and 2 meals ran our bill to $30+ ....for that price, we could have went to Cheesecake Factory lol 

Will we be back? Ehh....maybe..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice outdoor seating and the food is fantastic and healthy. The juices are fresh and not bottled. Greens and proteins is a great place to hang, meet-up, do business and enjoy great healthy food! Try it! The have a great free spa water in the back!"}
{"text":"Food was dry. Employees at register was rude... first time trying this restaurant and no one could explain anything to me . Won't be back !!"}
{"text":"The items I've tried here were delicious! Healthy eats can be had here. 

I Will be back"}
{"text":"This place has great vegan options for food and drinks. It's good quality, healthy, and tasty! It is pretty efficiently run as well, do they don't keep you waiting long even if it gets busy."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome healthy option not too far from the Vegas strip. Like 8 mins from the MGM. I got the veggie burger and loved it. Super tasty with the vegan cheese. They have everything- smoothies, salads, fish, meat, sandwiches, pizza. Not organic though... still I'll be back!


Lots of parking. 

Good service."}
{"text":"I tried the chocolate peanut butter banana shake for only $7.50 and the Real Deal Oatmeal for $5.99. I will definitely  be back! I stopped eating meat over a year ago. It's hard to find healthy options for vegetarians. This place is great for that. The prices aren't too high, the food selection is great, and they are open early (7am on Sunday)."}
{"text":"After trying many other \"healthy\" restaurants in the area, I have come back to try greens & proteins a few times and had to update my review because it really is delicious and nutritious! I love the \"build your own\" option where you can pick a protein, veggie and carb. I'm now addicted!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. Had some really tasty oatmeal and a real bright and refreshing watermelon strawberry juice. The decor and the plating are higher end then normal fast food places and the offerings are more interesting and varied. Minus one star because I'm a cheap skate. 12 something for my stuff today. Not horrible but I would be super happy if it was 9 or 10 bucks, but it's all good."}
{"text":"Again, super pricey but SUPER GOOD! 

It was my first time and it's near my job so I got it to go. I ordered it a little in advance (my fault) so I didn't get to enjoy the tofu fries as much as I would have dining in. The seasoning was good on them but I definitely wouldn't recommend them for takeout unless you are eating them immediately. (Duh) 

Got the bison burger because I read multiple reviews. I got mine with cheddar, turkey bacon, and avocado. So SO good!!! The flavor of this burger was amazing. Over a week after eating it and I'm drooling on the keyboard over this review. I didn't think I would get a burger of all things here but I am so happy I did! 

I love juices so I tried the green ginger juice (don't remember the exact name) it was probably the best juice I've ever purchased. I love ginger and this juice was just too good. I will definitely be stopping back for at least the juice bar if  I don't feel like spending $20 on lunch."}
{"text":"If I could eat this everyday, I would. But it's a little on the pricey side so wishful thinking. I always order the Build Your Own Meal. You choose your protein, grains, vegetable and a sauce. I usually order the chicken $9.99 or the salmon $12.99 and I would get quinoa and kale. Portions are great for lunch or dinner. Pretty good portion control ratio too might I add.

I love eating here....I feel very \"clean and happy\" afterwards...if that makes sense. =)"}
{"text":"Surely a great fan of greens and proteins.

Went on a diet for lent and this place helped a lot.  If I wanted to eat out and got tired of eating the diet food at home this was the place.  

California  grilled chicken wrap is my favorite.  You can build your own meals and learned if you're being carb free they had these \"HCG\" meals?  Very convenient.  

Very timely with you're pick up orders, friendly staff, clean restaurants.  Love that they have a water dispenser with lemons and limes in them. Really refreshing.

My favorite go to diet spot."}
{"text":"Yummy place. Health eating. Great burgers & wraps. Haven't tried there smoothies yet, but I plan too. I will definitely be back here alot. I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped by Greens and Proteins with my kiddos after church to try a juice and salad. My kids wanted a pizza which they devoured! It looked pretty tasty but I am on a cleanse and did not indulge. I ordered the Green Juice which was more like a smoothie. I would have given another star because the juice/smoothie had an amazing taste and was filled with incredible ingredients. I just couldn't get over the textures. If they sifted out all of the pulp and just left behind a smooth chilled JUICE, I would have been in heaven. Alas, I will return again anyway and try a protein and another juice because the workers were very friendly, knowledgable and inviting."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time and I must say the customer service is excellent along with their healthy food :)"}
{"text":"I'll update my review just because I like the food and it's very convenient to order it there."}
{"text":"This local chain of healthy restaurants are good enough to keep me from diving off the deep end, food-wise, into all that Las Vegas offers. This is my weekly \"in-to and out-of\" stop. I especially like showing up at my hotel with my Greens and Protein Wellness shake. Everyone swears they will head there after work because they are soooooo good.
Also, I cannot figure out what alcohol pairs with health drinks, so I don't spike it. This is a good thing.
HCG menu is great and the Margherita Pizza is a goal. I have had it and crave it.
This is Yummy-Healthy."}
{"text":"I can say I've only had one item on the menu that I wasn't a fan of (Veggie Garden Burger), other than that I have liked everything else I've tried on the menu. I like that both locations are located in the same plaza as the gym I belong to, it's convinient to grab a bite to eat afterwards. So why not 5 stars? Here's my beef with G&P:

1. The listed calories next to the item doesn't count the entire entree, i.e;
      *Turkey Burger w/ alfafla, L,T,O and low fat cheese (served on a bun and tofu fries) that is everything included in the entree, so my thought would be the calorie count should include everything, right? Nope, it doesn't include the bun or the tofu fries or the cheese. 

2. Food should be organic for the price. Especially the vegetables/fruits going into the juices & smoothies. Average price is $7.50.

3. Employees should be more knowledgable about their product. When I asked two employees about the calorie count, both gave me a different answer. Also, when I had lunch with my vegan friend, she asked if the sauce that came with the tofu fries was vegan, the girl had no idea, she had to go in the back to ask. Turns out, it's not. 

I still like the place, I am just more aware of what I'm eating here. There are a few items on the menu I'm in love with, vegan pizza, tofu fries and the wellness drink, these will keep me coming back, also I love the cucumber water."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something healthy but has a burst of flavor than you've come to right place!  It has a cute modern decor, all the meals have caloric value listed, and the food is fresh.  Yes, it may be a little pricer for a lunch place but I think you get what you pay for.  I had the greek pizza and it was DELICIOUS.  Cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, olives, and a little bit of sauce and boom - flavor in your mouth.  I highly recommend this place.  Looking over at my neighbors dishes, it makes me interested to try more!  There's so much to choose from."}
{"text":"Greens and protein by far my favorite lunch spot very reasonable for high-quality food my suggestion is the bison burger with tofu fries pizzas good great little snacks like brownies good stuff"}
{"text":"Very good but not mindblowing; just wish it wasn't so expensive and then it would be just right."}
{"text":"Originally I had wrote a good review for this place but my last visit really had me angry I came on a Sunday on a day they close \"early\" 3pm 

I walked in maybe 30/40 min before they close I was greeted by a female worker who was having a convo with someone that was eating there.... she LOOKED at me and said hello 

I go to the front and wait no one comes to take my order mean while this female employee is just in her convo... I literally stand there for 15 min I timed it!!! Finally I asked is someone going to help me she then turns to me oh it's Sunday we shut down the kitchen 30 min early.... I tell her I've been standing here 15 min you could've told me or said something ANYTHING she then says well I can ask for u see if they will make you something ...... I just said no thanks and just walked out maybe if you weren't to busy socializing on your job sitting on your butt you could do your job or least let your customers know instead of leaving them standing around 










oooo happy they finally opened I've been to all there other locations but this one is the closet for me at the moment

Everything is the same as the rest the cashiers are just as nice and helpful :) 

I'll basically be living here now 

I couldn't be happier"}
{"text":"Let's say...it smells healthy and clean in the cafe. I know that might sound weird but when you go to this place to eat you will know what I mean. 

I elected to try a protein shake here today and skip the Las Vegas Athletic club whey drink I normally get. The line was long and the dining area was packed. The staff was quick and friendly. I ordered a peanut butter banana smoothie which was chalk full of veggies,peanuts,raisins etc. I elected almond milk as well. The price was reasonable and I received my smoothie really quick. 

As for the taste... Less to be desires but good for being healthy. I would order a different shake next time. The texture was too gritty for me. I prefer my smoothies.. Well smooth! 

The food looked amazing and smelled great. Everyone eating seemed to love the food. I was impressed with the menu and hope to go back soon and try a bison burger! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try Greens & Proteins. Their veggie burger and tofu fries were praised by many so I figured it would be as amazing as reviewed.

I was mos def disappointed. The patty was really soggy. The texture was just weird and unlike any GOOD veggie burger I've had before. The tofu fries were OKAY. They were really crunchy on the outside but inside, it tasted like a soft scramble of egg whites. I don't think mine were cooked enough. & there were only 6 fries. SIX. Maybe if I had 10, I would've ate enough to have the same result as most reviewers.  

The experience didn't kill my hope in Greens & Proteins. I just won't ever have a burger there again. But I definitely will give their shakes a chance. They looked amazing!!"}
{"text":"Loved their other locations, now I have one easy to get to from my house. Bison cheese steak in a cabbage wrap is to die for"}
{"text":"I was really surprised of how good Greens and Proteins is. I had never been there,  but after my first visit I'll be going there often.  Service was fantastic as was the food.  I had an Ahi Protein Salad and it was absolutely great."}
{"text":"Why has it taken me so long to write a review for Greens & Proteins? I love this place for all the healthy items they serve, so I was surprised on my last visit that I never wrote one. 

Let me start by saying that they offer $1 off juices and smoothies with Yelp check in! My go-to drink would be their Wellness Drink. It contains green grapes, green apples, pineapples, oranges, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed and agave. Sounds like a salad gone wrong, but it's delicious. Its sweet, so you don't get the overpowering vegetable taste. Just remember to keep stirring it so you don't get a thick sludge at the end. It's an awesome meal replacement or a post workout drink. 

Their food is just as healthy as their drinks. Nothing is processed and everything is made to order. I like their tofu fries (light on the seasoning) and their margherita pizza as well. They have burgers and wraps, with the options of whole wheat buns or spinach tortillas as substitutions. They also offer unique items like bison or ostrich patties for your burgers. The prices are a little higher here, but you have to remember that eating healthy doesn't come cheap. You do get high quality ingredients and friendly helpful service. So I think it's so worth the price."}
{"text":"Extremely nommynommy I have never been a fan of tofu and today trying a Greek scramble the tofu in it was amazing"}
{"text":"G&P is my go to healthy fast food restaurant. I get the same thing every time I go there: salmon, sweet potato mash, broccoli, and lemon butter AND pesto sauces. How can you go wrong with that? It's delicious and healthy and got that Mediterranean diet on lock! The water has chlorophyll in it and the vibes are great. I've been to both locations and it's always dependable for healthy and bomb food. I hope more restaurants like this stem from their initiative!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Great variety on the menu with a little something for everyone. I personally got the turkey club with the sweet potato fries. The food came out very quick and they were the best sweet potato fries I have ever had! The turkey club was also terrific! I am definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I make a 15-20 minute drive every other day just to come here. Their veggie burger is delicious, especially with avocado! I always order it with the wellness juice on the side. Employees are also very friendly here! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, I will be the first to admit that eating anywhere that is remotely healthy is a major turn off for me. I even had one of my Yelp friends comment on my check in thinking it was a joke. Of course I wanted to appease my wife because she wanted seared ahi which is something that I like so at least that was a positive. 

Located just right off the south side of the 215 and Decatur exit in the same plaza as TSP Baking Company.

When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised at some of the choices they had for it were things that appealed to me. Things like an angus burger, bbq chicken pizza, and heck even filet mignon.

Wifey recommended I try the bison burger for it would taste just like some of my favorite burgers from other places. Ever since she had it about 15 years ago, it has been one of her favorite types of meat. 

So I order the Bison Burger with Tofu Fries, wifey got the Seared Ahi Tostada Bites, first son got the California Grilled Chicken sandwich, and youngest son got the build your own Filet Mignon accompanied with Asparagus.

The Bison Burger ($12.99) is a half pound patty topped with your choice of lowfat cheese (I got cheddar), lettuce, tomatoes, and onion. The Tofu Fries are wonderfully crispy fried and it comes with a tangy Russian dressing to dip in.

The Mini Ahi Tostada Bites ($9.99) are mini tortilla crisps with an edamame bean puree, wheatgrass slaw, sweet chili sauce, and seared ahi tuna. Kind of has a sweet and salty taste to it. Nice combination with the crunch as you chew. 

The California Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($10.99) has turkey bacon, lettuce, onion, tomato and extra virgin mayo. It was just ok. I think it could use more spices sauce wise. 

The build your own Filet Mignon ($16.99) comes with asparagus. The steak itself was just ok. My son wanted it medium rare but got it well done. He didnt want to wait for another one so he just ate it and said it was still kind of decent. Comes with some kind of balsamic dressing to dip it in. The asparagus was cooked perfect. It was lightly pan fried in olive oil and topped with a bit of garlic salt. Still had a nice crisp it. 

Service was on point. You order at the counter and then they bring it out to you. As they bring out people's orders, they go around asking if everybody is ok while cleaning up any tables that need it. Very efficient.

Overall, I am definitely a fan. Please dont tell anybody though, it would ruin my rep. Lets just keep it to ourselves ok? I would go as much as to say that trying the Bison Burger was the closest thing to a life changing event next to getting married, having kids, etc. I guess this health thing is not so bad after all.

{"text":"It was alright, we where all hungry and expecting filling fresh food based on the menu & pictures.  It was just ok nothing special salads where exactly what they where lettuce nothing spectacular but for $11.00 you'd expect to be full."}
{"text":"Clean and Healthy Food! Chef Caesar and the entire staff were friendly with professional service! Favorite restaurant in Vegas to eat accompanied by idrink water!"}
{"text":"Good quality clean eating meals and smoothies. It can be a little pricey but it's worth it. I'm a big fan of the BBQ chicken pizza on lavash bread. If you want to make your own healthy dish, they have a build your own selection! 

Convenient location next to the LVAC. Good customer service and clean environment."}
{"text":"Really love their options and portion sizes. The salads are very delicious and the bison burger is LOADED with protein! The taste is very delicious and I've yet to try their drinks. Btw they have alternatives to Coke and Pepsi for fountain drinks and they're really good too. It's too bad they don't have one by my house in long beach."}
{"text":"Great food and great service - awesome waxing salon next door I usually get my brows done while they blend my smoothie. Greens and proteins have all options for breakfast lunch and dinner as well as snacks and smoothies - no more excuses for fast food! Prices are a bit on the high side but who can put a price on health."}
{"text":"I had a great experience. The menu has so many wonderful and delicious healthy options. There are several options for modifying for the picky eaters. The cater to your heart's desire. I enjoyed one of their delicious salads. I had the size small, and it was plentiful, fresh and soooo good. My salad came with crunchy cheese croutons, made in house. I didn't purchase a drink because they offer a refreshing cucumber and lemon water to all customers. I'm glad I tried, it was so refreshing. I never felt so good walking out with a full stomach but not tired. Can't say enough. Must try."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a quick bite. I have been on a really strict exercise and diet plan for the past month & I am so grateful for this place. I can be confident that anything I order will not only taste good but also will fit in with my diet. staff is always so sweet & the manager Savannah is wonderful. Great for pre or post workout!"}
{"text":"I really wanna like this place. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. The food is good if you know what to order. If you do not, you might get stuck with something less than good.

The good-
The juices are pretty good. Never been disappointed here.
They have a sort of build your own meal. You pick a protein, grain, veggie and a sauce. That was probably my favorite meal here.
I also have tried the Gluten free pizza and it was pretty tasty.

The bad-
I ordered a burger with a gluten free bun. The gluten free bun was stale and hard.  I was really disappointed.
I know people seem to love the tofu fried but I did not like them. They were just rubbery and tasteless.


The service for me has always been pretty good. Once, they messed up me and my husband's order and they were quick to make it right, giving us an extra order of tofu fries. Though once my husband went in to pick up our order and a kid at the front desk called him \"boss\" which really annoyed him. He found it a bit condescending. 

Yes, I will go here again. I actually meet people here all the time. The dinning room is comfortable the decor is organic and inviting."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating at this place but their wait time can be super long. Waited 15 minutes just to get a smoothie! They should have someone specifically at the juice/smoothie section. If they already do, they need a more efficient one. Not to mention parking is super tight and one shouldn't have to pay for parking for more than 15 mins worth for a quick juice/smoothie!!"}
{"text":"tldr

They finally opened up a location up north, right next to LVAC.
The price point is pretty fair for what they offer.

Got:
-bison cheesesteak; paired with tofu fries and a pickle, right amount of flavor and cheese, delicious!
-bison burger; surprisingly tender and paired well with turkey bacon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a sunny Tuesday morning really excited that there is a healthy place with vegan options in the north side of town finally! We ordered the Southwest Tofu and Soy Chorizo Burrito and the Green Ginger Limeade Juice just to try it out for the first time and it was really great, I especially loved the crispy tofu that they served alongside the burrito. The juice was so satisfyingly tasty! It had all of my favorite flavors in one. 
They have complementary cucumber lime water in a nice fountain dispenser by the rest of the fountain drinks and it was delicious and a nice added touch. Definitely will be frequenting this location."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. It's consistently great. The service has always been really good too. I love that calories are listed next to the options. The tofu fries are the best! I think their portion size is a little small but over all a nice healthy option."}
{"text":"besides it being healthy the food is just amazing.. who knew pizza could be so yummy and healthy. 
I had the new white turkey bean bowl, by far my favorite"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Lots of choices from breakfast items, to juices and smoothies, to pizza, salads, burgers and wraps. They've got a variety of Goooood food that's gooood for you. 

I'm a big fan of Bison and this place has A bison burger AND a bison cheese steak wrap.  the bison wrap has so much flavor and I love the seasoned tofu fries or the jicama fries on the side. My cousin got a steak burger that she said was also just as delicious. 

So far I've been there and eaten three times. I went there once after taking an exam because I needed some fuel and ended up staying there to grade some papers while eating and sipping on some cucumber water (they do have wifi or you can use the Starbucks wifi next door!) and another couple times with friends and family. Choose something different each time! :) 

As far as service, I've had some friendly people and a couple not so friendly people at the register, but it hasn't affected me too much, so don't let that stop you. :)"}
{"text":"in a world of unhealthy choices greens and proteins provides you with nothing but the highway quality food made to treat your taste buds right but also your health.. This place is a life saver for anyone trying to eat healthy on the go"}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars. Greens and Proteins is an awesome resturant, but this location is the worse. Having visited a couple times and having terrible experiences everytime; not only with my food being burnt but with the lack of service. This review is one I needed to write, for the management to fix this problem. Most recently, I ordered a medium rare bison burger and sweet potato fries and an extra side of fries. I got a well done burger and literally burnt fries, as you will see in the photos. I understand a mistake but when I addressed it both employees acted dumb about it. As if they always make burnt fries, which made me not want to be as polite, but I let it go very disappointed and not even with an courtesy sorry. The pizza my friend got was terrible quality too. I can say with confidence that this is not how Greens and Proteins always is because other locations are better. Until this is fixed I would sway anyone from stopping at this location. There was no postitives this visit only negatives."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthful dishes. It's a bit precious in terms of clientele, though. People who seem enamored of their own reflection, or who don't cast one. But still, you can't find prepared food with such tasteful variety and without additives, preservatives, and other junk."}
{"text":"Called in food 30 min in advance. Asked to have ready at 1. Arrived 10 minutes after 1. Was not ready, took an additional 30 minutes. Brought out 1 of the 4 things that were ordered, completely wrong. Had to tell them again what we even ordered. Ahi Tuna salad was ok, had asked for dressing on the side but they put it in both salads so before they walked away, had to remind them the specifics of the 3 Rd salad.  No one was apologetic, as a matter of fact, they seemed annoyed that we questioned why the food was not done."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty! Gotta try the soy fries!"}
{"text":"This place is just eh. Not very impressed. I understand this is a healthier place but their food is lacking some serious flavor. 
I would come here if I was dieting but would much rather go somewhere else and modify my meal by asking for veggies on the side, no sauce, etc. than to come here and have a \"healthy\" one.
Plenty of other healthy places with better flavor."}
{"text":"good food outside the tofu fries. im seeing more competition from other health food restaurants. its good to see the healthy trend gaining momentum. their turkey burger is always my go to lunch item."}
{"text":"If I'm completely depleted after a workout and the thought of making a green smoothie or cooking breakfast makes me even more tired, you'll find me here picking up a Green Shake with Almond Milk. You can also see them cutting up fresh fruit and veggies in between orders. I have yet to venture out into their other drinks, but I did recently try their Breakfast Burrito that definitely fueled me post-workout. I know a lot of people say this place is over-priced, but healthy ingredients are generally pricier and what you are really paying for is the convenience and knowing/seeing your food is freshly prepared. And......they have packets of Cholula for to-go!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food that's dash diet friendly. Great service too! I have an egg allergy that makes eating out difficult but not here. I wish they had a restaurant near us in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with prompt, very friendly service. Priced extremely well with huge portions. Smoothies are delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance. I built my own plate with chicken, brown rice, broccoli and teriyaki sauce. I kind of hoped they would mix everything up for me but they didn't. It's cool though, I realize a lot of people may want to make that decision for themselves. The food is delicious and doesn't seem overly salty like so many restaurants. The nutrition and macronutrient info is on the menu by each item which makes it super helpful for those of us who keep track of that stuff! The only odd thing that I noticed was they didn't have any natural sweeteners (like honey or stevia), only white sugar and artificial stuff. A place that prides itself on health should probably start offering better options! But, it didn't affect me that day or anything so not holding it against them. The servers were friendly and the menu is quite extensive. I'd love to come back and try the smoothies and some of their other items!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Can I move in? ... will wash dishes for veggie burgers! I'm not even a vegetarian. Not even close. My eating habits range from ravenous 4 year old that skipped lunch, to bougie Michelin Star brat. 

Anyway, I ordered via Uber Eats. The food came really fast and was still hot. I opted for my favorite veggie burger on the planet, the G&P Veggie Burger. It's a lentil black bean, brown rice, mushroom, celery, carrot, onion, cilantro, basil, garlic and cashew patty that's 10.99. It makes me forget about bacon. Although I'm not a fan of lentils, it's not \"lentily\"--we'll pretend that's a word. I ordered it with their tofu fries. The bun was flaky, fresh & soft, the burger was very flavorful & moist (ew I hate the word moist lol) and the fries were different but cool! 

I love that they offer so many options for specialty diets. It makes it easier to order out for my kiddo. He got the Angus Burger on their gluten free bun with dairy free cheese. He loved it. It's hard enough dealing with severe allergies, places like G&P allows us not worry about allergen contaminations. 


Overall great food, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a healthy, quick option to grab a bite to eat. The menu is full of delicious options with low fat content and fresh ingredients. Yes, the menu is a little on the pricy side, but you get what you pay for. Juices are made with real fruits and vegetables and healthy ingredients are not cheap for anyone!
The inside is bright with vibrant green walls and large windows. The kitchen is open so you can watch the employees make your juices. The staff is always friendly and they bring your food out to you when it is ready. I appreciate this opposed to your number being called out. It feels more personal.

{"text":"My second visit in a week.  I had the bison wrap first awesome.  Chicken teriyaki wrap second not my favorite but I think because they ease up on the sauce.  Sweet Potato fries 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"I get food here often.  Today they decided to not put my tofu fries in the order.  I don't see how hard it is to ensure the customer get what they pay for.  I guess if I decide to return I will just have to treat them like incompetent fast food workers and checks entire order.  This sucks because I really like their food."}
{"text":"Why aren't you in California!!?? I was in Vegas about 3 weeks ago and tried this place out. Admittedly I am not a super healthy eater, but my friends who live in Vegas are and they swear by this place. I went for lunch and had the Bison Cheesesteak and it was amazing! And the fact that is was much better for you than a traditional cheesesteak was even more amazing. I went back a couple of days for breakfast and it was just as good. The best thing I can say about this place is that you don't realize you are eating \"healthy\" food. The taste, portions, and service are great. If I could, I would eat there all the time!"}
{"text":"Just because 0 is not an option!! What a stupid staff! i told them no pecans in my pancakes! They made it with pecans. And when I called them the manager told me they will make another one without pecans. And when I went to pick up my pancakes they told me that there is a pecan already in a butter they use for making the pancakes. And he told me that he didn't tell me to come back for another one! And they didn't offer to refund me my order. I was speechless...I am defenetly not going back!"}

{"text":"I got the chicken, brown rice and asparagus! It was so delicious. I love it  the smoothies are so yummy too I had the green shake and it was really good! It's a healthy place for sure. Something you eat after a good work out!"}
{"text":"I like the novelty of Greens and Proteins, but find the execution a bit \"off\".   It's nice to offer a version of fast food gone healthy, but I found many of the options very bland.  The jicama \"fries\" are a nice choice, but I'll go for the seasoned tofu fingers over the cool jicama any day.  The addition of the crunchy/healthy side is nice, though.  I had bites of the bison burger ordered by others at the table, which was fine - a typical bison burger, but my veggie patty was not what I expected.  I thought since the place focuses on healthy that the veggie patty would be - veggie.  But nope, it's 100% soy and pretty bland.  I was pretty dissappointed.  Some of the drinks/smoothies are fun, but it's not enough to draw me in without a meal I'm excited about.  I'll try more things, maybe some wraps will rock my world, but the bland and soy-ness of the veggie patty was enough to discourage me for a while."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten here, I got the Ahi protein salad for 14 dollars. It is absolutely horrible, not only did the entire salad stink when I opened my dish but the tuna was stringy and slimy, and my avocado was hard and underripe. My fruit bowl had rotten brown slimy pineapple. I don't mind paying 14 dollars for quality food but this was not. Extremely disappointed. I wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Simply delicious food. I had the salmon, asparagus and quinoa paired with the lemon vinaigrette... Perfection. Salmon was really well cooked, the vinaigrette was light and refreshing.  

Staff was super friendly. I was so stoked to hear they also have a location right near my apartment. This will become a regular spot!"}

My husband usually gets the Green Shake and this time I got the Antioxidant Chiller and it has become my favorite. Our favorite food to get is the Bison Burger. The meat is juicy and every bite is delicious. It comes with either jicama fries or tofu fries. We are not jicama fans so we get the tofu fries and they are yummy."}

Filled with gym-bunnies eating after the work-out, definitely keeping their trainers and diets happy!

The menu looks simple from fist appearances, but they really try to get creative with the flavors, and foods. For example, instead of potatoes, yummy little tofu bites. Over all I was impressed."}
{"text":"This is becoming the favorite place for \"Lunch Days\" with my staff!
If you are in the mood for an awesome salad, or even a healthy burger, this place will hook you up!  Have been for both lunches and brunches. Never disappointed! 

Tons of yummy healthy options on the menu. The Jicama \"fries\" are amazing!! And I love the bison burgers, I go back and forth on the jicama fries or the tofu fries, they are both so good, in completely different ways. The egg dishes are light, and tasty. I have never had a smoothie from here, but I see them making them like crazy, so I assume they are a local favorite.

There is a reason why this company has different locations popping up around the city.
Once people discover it, they love it! Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try a new healthy joint in Vegas after a day of splurging.  The place reminds me of veggie grill but they serve meat too. Appears to be very basic flavors and simple stand alone dishes. They have combinations of flavors for you to mix and match if you desire.

We ordered the tofu fries- not too bad
Thai chicken peanut bowl- not good at all. They mixed up my order. I asked for no rice. My bowl had specs of rice; as if the cook forgot and took the chicken out of the rice and placed in the greens. My bowl also had some beef? Not sure how they store the meats..

Meaty potato soup was not bad, literally ground turkey, potato, and kale with cream

They got my husbands order all wrong and late. They forgot the buffalo sauce for the chicken the meat was bland, and they forgot the egg white add on.

Our friend ordered a banana split smoothly that tastes like water and ice.


The place was not busy at all and they keep missing up our order.

I still prefer veggie nation near the area :)"}
{"text":"Wrote a really great review awhile back, but unfortunately my thoughts have changed. Recently I have been ordering to go and each time my order has been wrong. I write in all caps on my orders for no cheese because I am lactose intolerant and cheese does not sit well with my body. Unfortunately, the last 7 times there has always been cheese, orders are mixed up with my husband's order. I.e they put cheese on my angus burger and no cheese on his bison burger, cheese on my salads, etc. I've always tried to give the benefit of the doubt because I love their food. But it seems like there is always miscommunication or no one truly reads my entire order. Again, a meal I can't eat because of the cheese. :/"}
{"text":"I had a peanut butter banana chocolate protein smoothie and the barbecue chicken pizza. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"10 check-ins and I'm the Duke! 

This is my review it is almost sickeningly green in here these lime green plastic chairs are hard on the eyes. It's like you want to eat and get out. Tne walls and a good chunk of the ceiling are also bright ass green. Most of the tables wobble, it's usually packed and loud. But damned if the food doesn't keep bringing me back even though it is 10 miles from my house so 2 stars on interior 4 stars on food."}
{"text":"A definite must go when I'm in Vegas! Staff is always friendly! Love their tofu fries and their French toast is AWESOME! Their green shake and wellness drink are my favorite beverages! BBQ chicken pizza on lavash is DELICIOUS! I wish they opened one in San Diego!!!!"}
{"text":"Lots of healthy options. I love getting the \"create your own\" because I can keep my dinner low calorie and clean by doubling up on the greens. Also, the gluten free pizza is really yummy. I suggest getting it extra crispy though. Only downfall for me is that their \"juices\" are smoothies and not green enough for me. Overall, a great place to check out if you ate trying to eat healthier"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Its the perfect place to start eating healthier and transitioning yourself into a healthier lifestyle. My \"go to\" is a create your own, where u pick a protein, a green, a grain, & a sauce. If I'm splurging I go with the gluten free BBQ chicken pizza. I myself have Celiac disease (gluten intolerance) and have to be very picky about where & what I eat; its nice that the staff is well educated on which items, including sauces & dressing, fit my food requirements. Also, staff is very friendly! Can't wait to see this place grow more and more popular!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat healthy. Food is delicious and there are a lot of options. Only issue is it is a little pricy"}
{"text":"I love going here! The chocolate veggiechinno is the best ever, with almond milk of course. I've been vegan since January and this place is great stop for a fast meal or pick me up smoothie."}
{"text":"**Smoothie Review**

Great smoothies and a solid option for that mid-afternoon snack attack. 

I've only ever had the smoothies and let me tell ya... they're tasty. I usually get one after the gym or when I'm fighting back that burrito craving. Greens and Proteins offers multiple smoothies options: Green Shake, Chocolate Peanut Butter and Banana shake and something called the Apple Pie... the list goes on, but you get it, right? 

I'VE TRIED BOTH:  The Green Shake & its Chocolate mutant counterpart. 

The Green Shake is delicious. Filled with banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. This beast will definitely curb hunger cravings, but won't leave you feeling overstuffed and gross. Great smoothie for the Green and Protein curious but isn't sure about all this weird healthy food business. Not only is this drink tasty, but the super silky texture is a great way to smooth out a rough day. Ha! 

The Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake is for the person who needs to be tricked into eating \"healthy\". This drink, with over 700 calories, comes fully equipped with cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This is definitely a meal substitute and should be treated as such. This one is actually my favorite (duh) because I drink this instead of eating a heavy lunch, but it also does what it's supposed to do, fill you up. 

I'm a big dude, so if these smoothies can tide me over until my next feeding, than I'm sure the twiggy masses will be set for days. Keep it smoothie!"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat out because I have to stick to a gluten free diet so im very limited. 
It was my first time in and Kristen I believe her name was really took amazing care of me. She showed me the most amazing meal ever. I most definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Pricey healthy food. But good! I love their smoothies/juices, lots of different options. My favorites are the Wellness drink, Green Leaf Berry Blast and Apple Pie Smoothie. They list all of the ingredients and calories on the menu so that's great.
As for food, they offer a great variety as well. Soups, salads, BURGERS, PIZZA lol, raw and smaller items. I must say, for being super healthy, the tofu fries are actually pretty good. I also like their Bison Burger and BBQ Chicken Pizza. Where else can you eat a whole pizza for around 350 calories?? Score!
If you're an avid greens & proteins person, they have an app where you can place orders. It's pretty busy most of the time so that's helpful. Workers are friendly and there's a bit more wait time so give them an extra 5 minutes.
I was thinking to give them 3 stars because it's a little pricey and because nothing is like omg melt in your mouth i'm craving for it good but then I had to smack myself and remind myself what type of business they are. Let's get real, it's not meant to taste like cheesecake factory with 1500 calories per dish lol for the type of food they offer, they do amazing. And again, for the type of food they offer, it's naturally pricey anyways so 4 stars! Don't forget to check in for $1 off juices and smoothies!  :)"}
{"text":"Greens and protein is my go to spot if I'm looking for a quick, healthy meal.  Their menu has enough variety to satisfy your pallet regardless of what you are in the mood for (assuming you want to eat healthy).  It is conveniently located .1 mile off the Eastern exit on the 215. 

The vibe is very fresh when you walk in.  The staff is very prompt and friendly.  They have a full juice/smoothie bar (peanut butter/banana/chocolate smooth is phenomenal), grill, and healthy treat options.  

My favorite meal to order here is the bison cheesesteak.  The Bison is wrapped in a spinach wrap with melted cheese, peppers, and some type of chipotle sauce mixed in. 

The bison burger is also delicious.  It is much leaner than beef burgers so it's not as juicy, but they do well at making it very flavorful."}
{"text":"I dined here when they first opened and thought it was simply mediocre, food wise. But organization and the overall restaurant decor wasn't too great. 
I'm happy to say that things have certainly changed now. The food is good, drinks are great, and restaurant has grown into something special. Most people complain about price, and yes, it's not cheap. But I'd rather pay $2-3 more for a meal and get something that tastes fresh and made with organic/quality ingrediants."}
{"text":"Grateful to have a healthy option in the area! The food is well-prepared by a kind staff. I eat here at least once a week & am a big fan of the HGC options. The bison burger is a great cheat day meal! Can't get enough of the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Great place with lots of non-animal product choices. I've brought omni friends here and they LOVE the tofu. A little pricey but great food."}
{"text":"Wow. Just had the turkey and it was awesome!
It's nice to eat quick - have it be good and healthy and only a few dollars more than what daft food (my phone autocorrected fast food to daft food and I think that's a better name for it so I'm leaving it) would cost. 
2 sides came with it - I had sautéed kale (it was ok) and asparagus (really good)."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is clean and refreshing. Does not have any gross \"healthy god tastes\" yummmmm"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times over the years. Now that I'm more health conscious and watch what animal products I put into my body- Greens & Proteins is a good option. They offer vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free choices, plus animal for those who are so inclined. 
The bright green color scheme is still overwhelming for my eyes. They had 2 tvs to keep you occupied. Lots of seating inside and a few tables outside. When I came in on a Saturday around 11- it was pretty quiet but the dining area was pretty messy. A lot of tables with crumbs and food items and the floor was dirty as well. 
My veggie burger was way over cooked. It was dark brown and really crunchy. Hard to finish it because it was pretty dry. 
Went today and had the mock chicken wraps. They were so salty. I couldn't even finish them. 
Staff was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I am on a new road to healthier eating and this is a great place to go to for a smoothie or a light meal. I tried the Green Shake and I am hooked! I also ordered some broccoli soup, hummus/pita, and a Margherita pizza with the Vegan option. The shake was refreshing,filling, and delicious. The food however was just not my style. I saw other people enjoying their meals. I would say nothing was wrong with the food at all. It was made fresh and with good looking ingredients. I just think as of now, I'm more on a juicing/smoothie kick. The open plan of the kitchen was nice to be able to see your food being made in front of you. I liked the modern and clean look of the decor. There was a large patio to enjoy the spring/fall seasons here in Vegas. 
My only gripe.. the noise level!
Bring earplugs. When they get those blenders going... It's LOUD!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that this side of town has lots of healthy options popping up lately. G and P is another light and healthy choice if your wallet can handle it. I know fresh options are usually more expensive, but for some reason, G and P always seems to feel like I am paying a few dollars too much for the items that I order. I have ordered their juices, salads, wraps, and pizzas. All were very tasty, flavorful, and yes-- fresh. 
I usually get my orders to go because it is a small place and get crowded. I have seen the owner/manager come out and talk to the costumers and bring the meals to the tables which is a nice touch. 
I do however HATE how dang tall the counter is when you are standing in line to order. I feel trapped and claustrophobic while I am waiting. I get a neck cramp trying to look over the wall and strain to read the menu. 
Oh well. The sacrifices we make to eat some healthy food. :)"}
{"text":"Jump on the train!  Eat healthy!  This new place is located within walking distance of my office, and when I'm there (which is almost never) I head over for lunch.  Great salads, and even better juices, with a friendly staff and a casual atmosphere.  I always feel weird about leaving dirty dishes on a table in a fast casual restaurant like this, but I'm warming to the idea.  Summer Berry Spinach Salad, Harvest Kale Stocked Salad, and Bison Cheese Steak are current faves.  Try a Wellness Drink or a Green Ginger Limeade, and you too will be a happy, healthy human!"}
{"text":"I die for their vegan burger wrapped in cabbage with tofu fries. Seasoned to perfection and portioned great for a curvy girl on the go!"}
{"text":"The BEST Veggie burger I have ever eaten- and the cabbage wrap & tofu fries are fantastic! I ordered two days in a row."}
{"text":"First Time Eating Here,It Was A Little Pricey. I Ordered The Bison Burger Which Was Really Delicious,And Got Hiccama(Spelling?) Fries Which Were Not Really My Thing.I Ordered A Watermelon Raspberry Juice And It Was Okay.All In All I Think That Its Too Expensive But The Bison Burger Was Really Good.Great Location Near LVAC On Decatur And The Staff Was Really Nice And Helpful In Explaining Things."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The bison cheesesteak, turkey burger, and lean angus beef burger are my favorites. The green shake is the bomb.com! That cucumber water is really refreshing with this heat. 

I recently got there app on my phone and it made buying lunch so much easier. Order it and in about 10 minutes it's ready!"}
{"text":"I love this place because of their awesome crew! Shout out to Blake and Steven for always being so friendly and accommodating! 

I have never been to the other locations before but I have grown to love this one since it is closer to where I live now. It is also not too far from Planet Fitness on Rainbow and 215 so this is definitely my favorite go to place for my post-workout meals. I've been to this location four times already and the food is fresh and delicious every time. 

They offer a wide selection of meals, protein shakes and smoothies. If you are watching your calorie intake, this place is great. They have low calorie pizzas and burgers!  I will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for delicious and healthy food."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST juice I have ever had. I'm honestly, extremely picky about juices...haven't found one that I liked...till now! The Wellness Drink is one that is a must try. It had green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed, and agave. The proportions were perfect that you don't taste too much of one ingredient. 

I only gave it 4 since this is the only item I've tried. I wish they brought it to LA, it would do so well! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm DEFINITELY coming back."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to go when I'm visiting Vegas. I always get the Wellness Drink without Stevia. It's sweet enough with the fruit that you can't taste the greens. If you check in on yelp you get $1 a juice or smoothie. The person who helped us out...Steve? was great. Very personable and gave great recommendations.

Still waiting for this place to come out to LA!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I really dig this place. The food was excellent. (I split two meals between my girlfriend and me: the tofu chorizo breakfrast burrito and the veggie wrap.) I really dig a place that purports to be fresh and healthy *and actually is*. There were little things that made the experience better, as well. The staff was obviously very happy and interested in their food, our satisfaction, etc. It didn't feel forced, they actually seemed happy to be there and like they cared what we thought. And this might sound lame, but we didn't order drinks, and they proactively offered water cups to us, and then we saw that the water was nor just a fountain-style plain water but rather a cucumber/lemon water concoction that tasted great.

The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 is that it IS a bit pricey. Our two meals, without drinks, came to $20. And the second time I went I got a medium-ish sized smoothie for more than $8. But I feel like that's worth it for what we got: indisputably fresh, healthy meals.

I'll be going back regularly."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for a Wellness drink here. Turns out, they forgot about it. After finally receiving my drink, I didn't get an apology or anything. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Dining out is so hard when you're trying to stay healthy, but this place takes the temptation out of the dining out experience because everything on their menu is good for you! I've tried the turkey burger, the bison burger, and a wrap (can't recall which one) and was pleased with each. The tofu fries are really yummy!!! This place is pretty expensive though, but I guess when you're putting good stuff into your body it's worth it"}
{"text":"This place was ok...

Yes, its healthy and good for you but what the hell? My brother treated me, himself and his wife to dinner and it came out to $50.00!!!  For dinner at that price I would have expected a better quality and portioned meal. Do not get the tuna salad....sooo little tuna and also I would stick to the wraps and sandwiches. My brother got the build your own meal, and the tuna was not cooked properly, no flavor and very small portions. I got the chicken wrap and it was really good but hot damn they are pricey. I got the leafy berry smoothie...was not that good and really?? Almost $8.00?! If you are going to spend that god awful amount on a smoothie or juice get the green wellness or whatever its called, it tastes better. Overall, I will not be coming back here unless its on someone else's dime. I would rather spend the money on groceries and cook something healthy at home."}
{"text":"I thought this place was awesome! I had the buffalo cheesesteak sandwihch with a side of jicama fries (not cooked...raw) which was a very welcome and wholesome change for the norm. 

The atmosphere is modern. Seating is pretty ample and comfortable for all sizes. Most of the patrons have on workout clothing as the LV Athletic Club is in the same shopping center. Parking seems a little cramped but there's always a good amount of parking spaces available. 

They also have cafe seating with very nice furniture. I was impressed and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good Lookin' and Healthy is what you feel when you head in here for a snack! 
I enjoy this cause it's faster than me shopping for the ingredients and doing it myself when I'm in a crunch for time! 
Grab and go is how I feel when I stop for a smoothie and/or juice! 
Doc would be proud of me! 
Just wish they had more juices!           (((o(*??*)o))) over all satisfied!!! I like the fact that it's yum stuff"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! They have great food selections. I've tried their Greek pizza, breakfast burritos, jicama fries, watermelon juice, and their green machine shake. It's all amazing. If you get the green machine shake get it with almond milk preferably."}
{"text":"Love that's it's good food when I don't feel like making good food.  But then again, if I'm eating out, I want something a little more exciting than what I make for myself at home.  I've tried enough to have my safe menu items and I go there for them. 
Love the Grilled Vegetable Frittata and the delicious Watermelon and Feta Salad that comes with it (Idk why this keep this secret, it's not mentioned on the menu at all but comes w the frittata and can be ordered as a meal)! Also the sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had anywhere, I crave them often. I also really enjoy their acai bowl, no added sugar but soooooo sweet and delish!! 

If at first you don't like something, keep trying.  It's a good alternative to cooking or eating crap out."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. I love their food and juices.

Had the Harvest Kale salad and pumpkin loaf. The salad was delicious and very \"citrusy.\" I'm not sure if the pumpkin bread is seasonal but it was also very good.

My sister had the turkey club and sweet potato french fries and said it was good.

Solid food all-around!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am back on my healthy kick, Greens & Proteins is my go to! Normally, I would say it is a little overpriced, but for great quality food, sometimes you have to pay a little extra.

Bison Cheesesteak Wrap is my go to! When I'm being really good, I'll turn it into a salad, with no tortilla. This place is awesome to modifying anything that I get here.

The staff is awesome and very attentive and friendly. Always great when it comes to recommendations and taking care of their guests! 

Great place for a quick bite or a casual luncheon!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service,  Friendly staff.  I like their spinach salad and salads in general.  Chicken was moist and tender and greens fresh. Once I placed my order the staff followed up and made sure that my order was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  I have no affiliation with this restaurant, but fell I should note excellent service when provided! Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love at first sip ... Green Machine shake ... a must have!  and Tofu fries :) nom nom"}
{"text":"Fave fuel station for post or pre workouts...or to grab a healthy bite. Tofu fries, wellness drink, green shake and raw macho nacho are my faves. Vegan and vegetarian friendly. Free wifi too."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this healthy spot. I travel to Vegas and absolutely love this place for its healthy options. However the team must work on those customer service factors like speediness. I ordered an Americano and it took about 10minutes and there were no customers waiting. Either it's a training issue with new staff or they are totally oblivious to this piece of running a business."}
{"text":"This will be my third time here. The service here is phenomenal! Also the service is very fast the manu is amazing with all the healthy choices and very tasty, and fresh! satisfied customers definitely always a choice to return."}
{"text":"I have recently found myself on a low-carb, high protein kick.  For that reason, I thought Greens and Proteins would be right up my alley.  I visited their Green Valley location and found the food to be a healthy alternative, but a little on the pricey side compared to other restaurants that offer similar fare (Rachel's Kitchen, Daily Wellness, etc).

About a week later I decided to give the Greens and Proteins location at Flamingo and the 215 a try and I was greatly disappointed.  The service was very slow and when I brought the issue to the manager's attention his reaction was trite and condescending.  He did nothing to rectify the situation and told me I had no reason to complain.  When I went to eat my to-go order, an ostrich burger lettuce wrap, I found it was topped with a rotten avocado and it was missing the turkey bacon I ordered.  

For the price point (my meal was $18) I found the service and quality to be lacking.  On the upside, after reading another negative Yelp! review of this establishment, I found a great nearby \"healthy alternative\" restaurant that I will be returning to for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my new home to see what's around. I got the Green Leaf Berry Blast Smoothie and the California Grilled Chicken Wrap. I loved their smoothie options, however the one I ordered lacks a little flavor. Still good, just not what I thought it would taste like. That being said, the wrap is HELLA delicious. This is definitely a place I'll be frequenting for an healthy meal on my lazy cook days."}
{"text":"Really good for people with diet restrictions or food allergies.  They have healthy shakes and they also juice there.  The Jicama fries are different but very good.  I like that you can build your own meal by choosing your meat and vegetable.  The decor is pretty cool as well.  You order at the counter and they bring it out to you, very laid back environment.  It is in the same lot as Las Vegas Athletic Club, so there are a lot of people in there juicing or getting shakes after working out.  Cool environment."}
{"text":"Absolutely Floored!!!! I just received a call from the owner of Proteins and Greens. letting me know that I overpaid for my Chocolate Peanut Butter shake, apparently I gave the cashier a $20.00 dollar bill and walked away with my smoothie, I thought I gave her a ten dollar bill therefore leaving the remainder as a tip. I love the Honesty and Integrity of  this establishment!! The quality of the food is spectacular, the service is second to none and the attention to detail ranks with any 5 Star establishment that I have ever been to!!! I am speechless....Kudos to the entire team of Greens and Proteins!! They officially earned my business for a lifetime...."}
{"text":"I always love grabbing a quick and clean power lunch at Greens & Proteins! 

I usually get the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap in a spinach tortilla. Side of Sriracha sauce. 
Amazing! 

Also try the tofu fries, they are delicious. 

Top it all off w a Green wellness juice and you've got the perfect balanced lunch!!"}
{"text":"I am definitely planning on trying to become a regular here!  Every week I find myself talking about how I need to change my eating habits and start eating right!  (More like every morning, but I'm trying to make myself feel better here!) Well, Greens and Proteins is definitely a step in the right direction!! I met a girlfriend here one afternoon for a quick lunch and I was definitely in love!  We both got smoothies and split one of their breakfast options.  I was definitely satisfied by the end of our meal!  

I got their acai smoothie and I loved it!  It wasn't as thick as some smoothie places make their smoothies and I was definitely happy about that!  It was the perfect flavor and consistency.  AND, it filled me up!  Now, I'm a hungry, hungry hippo, so I usually need a lot more than a smoothie to satisfy my hunger.  But not here!  My appetite was completely satisfied and I had to force myself to split the frittata with my friend.  Which was also delicious!!! 

This is definitely an amazing healthy alternative in the area and I can't wait to go back and try even more!"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm so impressed. Ceaser just gave us samples from the new vegan menu. AMAZING! I pray that they keep all of them. So good. Had the vegan burger and the vegan Philly cheese steak, tasted so much like meat if it hadn't come from the cook I'd have been suspicious. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"THIS  place is all the rave.  So, I had to come check it out.  I had the veggie burger w daiya cheese and a lettuce wrap to avoid any soy. My burger came w jicama fries....which are not FRIED at all.  I didn't expect that one!! They were cut to look like actual fries, served raw and seasoned with real lemon juice and paprika.  The burger was good..decent. The fries were a nice healthy alternative and not too bad themselves. I started w an Apple pie smoothie....expecting the flavor God's to swoop me up to food heaven....but yeah NO! It was flavorless....a huge disappointment after the big intro given by the cashier. Not sure what it needs, but it was missing \"something\".  Service was good, staff very helpful w questions. Overall it was a satisfying meal....all vegan, no soy and no added sugar....AWESOME!! Will come back for the burger and a different smoothie next time. Oh and they have crushed ice.....my absolute favorite kind of ice lol. The crushed ice added to my experience of course!! Great healthy alternative to Mickey D's....TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Okay. 
The food presentation is 5/5.
Taste 4/5. It tends to be a little bland so I added salt, which fixed the problem. Good flavor. 
Price 3/5. Purchased two bison steak wraps and 1 chicken tenders meal. It cost $50. That price is enough for a dinner at Olive Garden. 
 
Would come back to try some more food, definitely."}
{"text":"Very good first time dining at this place! The menu is kind of expensive but then again what can you expect from a place that aims for healthy eating! They have this $1 off coupon that you can use on the $7.50 smoothie drink :-/ it was ok.. I ordered the \"Wellness\" drink which I could've made at home myself nothing special..I feel like they should give more than a dollar off that's not even covering the tax on the drink itself but that's neither here nor there.. On to the food.. So my friend talked me into ordering the Bison Cheese Steak which honestly was good but for sure not worth $10.99 I got a pinch on cheese steak with ALL that bread and some light mozzarella.. I enjoyed the tofu fries more than anything else to be honest! I guess I'll just have to try something different on the menu because I won't let one mediocre experience take away from the whole dining experience.."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy are a rare combination, but Greens and Proteins nails it! The service here is also top notch. I enjoyed a lean angus burger perfectly cooked medium served with savory tofu fries and a pickle. Steve-O served me and was incredibly attentive and generous! Now, I'm sure this doesn't happen often, but he offered me a trio of smoothie samples to try and two free smoothies! He also brought some bbq sauce to accompany my burger and my utensils to my table. Great value, so yummy, and guilt-free. Greens and Proteins is healthy eating must!"}
{"text":"This time I ordered the granola french toast with a juice containing watermelon; apples; kale; blueberries. The french toast was poorly executed. In certain areas it was undercooked and it contained too much granola that was not sticking to the bread properly. When I finished I was left with a plate of granola. The juice was also disappointing and had a watered down taste from the ice they used. 

I like the menu here however some of the recipes need tweaking."}
{"text":"Before I placed my order, I asked the girl at the register what Greens and Proteins specialties are and she said make your own plate, and the BBQ chicken pizza. I decided on the pizza. 

My order came about 20 min later maybe even a bit longer which I think is too long for a fast casual restaurant. When I took the first bite of the pizza all I could taste was the BBQ sauce. While the BBQ sauce did grow on me after a few bites, I almost thought it tasted a little too unique. Additionally, if a \"traditional\" BBQ sauce is not used, the menu should specify the type of BBQ sauce being used (citrus BBQ sauce). Now on to the chicken, I did not like the spice on the chicken and it was a little dry. The positives were that the pizza is low calorie so you can finish the whole thing; the fat free ranch is delicious; the lavash bread gave the pizza a nice crunch.

Towards the end of my meal, I called over the manager to give him some feedback. While I appreciated him sitting down with me and having an open conversation, I did not like the fact that he said normally I would offer a refund but in this case I don't think we did anything wrong. I wasn't asking for a refund just offering my honest feedback. 

Overall, I like the concept of the restaurant and I am willing to come back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great green drinks and smoothies. Food is great and very fresh. Only reason for 4 stars is because it is slightly pricey. But it is definitely worth it. 

Decor is so fun and modern. Wonderful friendly staff too! If you are looking for a HEALTHY place this is where you should go"}
{"text":"The Bison Cheese Steak Spinach Wrap is amaze-balls! Mmm good... I will be thinking about it for days. The Bison was cooked well, soft and great comparison with the cheese and spinach wrap. A great filling and healthy option. The Tofu fries were a bit lacking in flavor and had an oily/greasy taste. The decor is well green and very natural and outdoorsy. Very relaxing and Zen ambience! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"My go to spot for healthy and tasty food. Love the bulgogi bowl. Friendly workers and my only slight complaint is that it's a tad pricey here."}
{"text":"Love this place! I love the juices and burgers. Very healthy. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Indeed a healthy and delicious choice!!! e

Even though some foods many be bland they're still pretty good and best thing, you can even taste how HEALTHY they are ;)"}
{"text":"As someone allergic to milk, I must evade pizza (seemingly at every turn).  Fortunately, the pizza here can be ordered with vegan cheese!  Further, it tastes amazing.  Crispy crust, fresh toppings, well seasoned.

I also ordered the green ginger limeade to wash it down.

Juice was ok- but the pizza made the trip."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go after a workout. Not a good place to go if you are super hungry. You won't feel guilty after your workout since they serve sort of healthy entrees. The serving here is smaller than usual and is pricey. 

My bf and I ordered a bison burger (very dry even though my bf mentioned that he wanted it cooked medium), crab wrap and a BBQ chicken pizza. For 3 items, it was almost $40. The crab wrap was not bad. You can see some crab pieces in it. The pizza was okay. Nothing special. 

One thing I liked here is their free cucumber lemon water. Very refreshing! 

Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place but it's just not that great. It's possible I ordered entirely the wrong thing, but it also took forever to come out (20 minutes), and then one of the containers exploded (opened) in the car and spilled salad all over the floor. 

The bison burger, which I ordered medium, was way way way overdone. Well done in fact. It was flavorless, and the toppings were soggy even though they were separate from the burger. It came with jicama or tofu fries. I got the jicama fries. They were covered in chili powder. I'm not a fan of chili powder. I love jicama. I also got a caesar salad, which was itself actually good minus the exploding container. The little tub of dressing would not have been enough had I not lost half of the salad to the car floorboards, so that was a blessing in disguise. Burger and salad cost $11+5, fountain drink was $2 or $3. They also offer fancy healthy shakes/smoothies for $6-7. 

Menu not offered in a format other than 10 feet above the registers or glued to the counter at the register. Made it hard to figure out what to order since I couldn't read the options. :/"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while as I live around the corner... Impressed with the skinny chef salad! Was afraid it wouldn't have enough going on, but was wrong. Not the best salad I've ever had but pretty good and definitely filling. Service was good and quick as I got it to go and can't wait to stop by again to try a build your own dish. On"}
{"text":"Great food!

Green Veggichino is the best Frappuccino replacement.  Everyone here is friendly, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  Lots to choose from!  It may be quicker to call in your order, depending on the food you get..It may take a little while."}
{"text":"I like this food.  Seems healthy. Good value.  Two locations.  Jicama fries are awesome."}
{"text":"I order To-Go orders from Greens and Proteins often. However, I just called to ask if they could accept a To-Go order, considering the fact that they were going to close in 20 minutes. My first attempt to call the restaurant, it rang for a good minute. Then all of the sudden, I was on hold (which I found out through the pre-recorded prompt) and no one answered. So, I tried calling once more to see if it was a mistake and the kid who answered was absolutely rude. Dramatically sighing out of irritation, that I was calling so close to closing time. It's obvious that someone placed my call on hold my first attempt, in hopes that it would deter me, or any business for that matter, from ordering this late."}
{"text":"I don't think that healthy should necessarily = expensive. I've had better for cheaper. I can make better for cheaper. 

I went here after a workout. I got the Ahi Tuna salad which was okay. The lettuce was crunchy and the avocado was creamy, but I think the mushrooms overpowered the whole dish. I thought it would be a \"hot\" salad instead of the cold salad thinking they would have seared the tuna last and give it to me. My bad on assuming that though. 

The Green smoothie I got was good, but didn't think it was worth about $8. 

The size of this place is decent. It's very clean and I liked that they bring the food to you. The staff was friendly, until I looked at the menu to make my decision, then the he stopped paying attention to me to talk to another staff."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. Service was trash, food was sub par and super overpriced. I sadly will not ever be returning due to the quality of everything."}
{"text":"Love this place, great options for fitness and healthy conscious people like my self, there is always something that will help you fulfill your macros.  The restaurant is cute and the staff is always helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"My new spot for delicious low carb meals and smoothies! I'm so glad they are finally open and conveniently located next to my gym. This is what they are giving us:

Vegan/Vegetarians- Tofu fries, hummus, veggie burgers, smoothies, pizza, salads, soups etc. 

Gluten-free Groupies- For all the Crossfitters and others on the Gluten-free wagon they offer pizza crust, burger buns, etc. all Gluten-free! 

HCG Dieters- Yeah, all you crazy girls shooting yourself up with Lord knows what Greens and Proteins offers a meal replacement shake for you!

Low-carb Heads- Yes, I'm one. For us, they can make any sandwich into a wrap. 

For everyone and their moms- They have a design your own meal option. Choose the protein (grilled, steamed or sauted) which includes low fat Ostrich, Bison, turkey, etc. Next you choose your veggie which range from asparagus, spinach, broccoli, etc. Next you choose grains- mashed sweet potatoes, cous cous, brown rice, low carb pasta, etc. Lastly you choose the sauce which is everything from peanut sauce, salad dressing to a pesto or bbq sauce. The combination choices are endless! 

The drink selection really turns me on. They offer several different unique smoothies and also some that combine healthy herbs and veggies with coffee I can't wait to try. The soda fountain has figure friendly Coke Zero, Light Lemonade and Sprite Zero. This is unheard of to have all of them! 

Next time you want to get your healthy on EAT HERE. Your body will thank me."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and it has been good and healthy every time. I like that I can have a hearty, good meal and stay within a decent calorie range. This morning I had the egg white with turkey sausage and tofu fries. I love the tofu fries- they are fab! They play good music in here too:)"}
{"text":"Love that we have a place like this on MY side of town! Very delicious good food! My new spot! I like the vibe, though it was strange to hear country music on (and a little too loud outside) and at a good volume (inside). 

It's a really fascinating concept. Just wish they had bike racks (but, that might be more of a Vegas problem...) I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Fun healthy meals with good service. The BBQ pizza on the lavash crust is my favorite. I follow flexible dieting so I love how they list the macros so I can track my food. This is a new location and they play awesome reggae music at night. The vibe is good and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Close to my house and the gym this place is my go to for that post work dinner. Steve was great and very helpful and polite"}
{"text":"So far I love the place. Every good customer service. A place near my house that has good food choices. Definitely going to come back! A bit pricey but it's well worth it for a healthy life style on the go and when you're in a hurry. Love the ostrich burger and the acai berry smoothie."}
{"text":"Giving THIS LOCATION 3 stars based on the fact that both times I've been here the customer service has been sub-par. Ive had Greens & Proteins many many times and i was very excited to see that they opened one up where i live. The food is still amazing here, and i will continue to visit this location, only because its so close. Both times that ive been here, ive never been greeted when walking in, or when walking up to the counter. I work in Hospitality, i know how easy and simple it is to greet people that walk through your doors. So for me its unacceptable to watch the people who work here ignore me while im standing at the counter, and then pretend like they didnt see me or act like im the odd one when i didnt walk up to the counter immediately."}
{"text":"My favorite everyday restaurant! Healthy, delicious and friendly staff. Changed the way I eat"}
{"text":"The staff is very helpful! I had my toddler with me when I had to make several orders for friends and the guy assisting me (I'm upset I didn't get his name) offered to assist me bringing it to the car since I had my hands full with my little one. Great staff !"}
{"text":"Best healthy place to eat in las vegas. Usually get the wellness drink which is far better tasting then the green drink at whole foods. The tofu fries are as close to healthy fries as you get. Havent tried everything but everything I have tried is very tasty. Best tasting healthy food around."}
{"text":"I must say I was not impressed. My husband is EXTREMELY gluten sensitive  (it's not a fad, but a really big deal, like an allergy) and when trying to explain this to the guy at the counter he became impatient and huffy. I am not sure if he was the manager or what, but regardless of how busy you are, you need to maintain a certain level of professionalism and care about people, especially food allergies. He was dismissive and after we ordered, I was sure they didn't prepare his food correctly. I ordered an albacore salad and it was just \"okay\". My husband had requested just a bed of rice with bison and veggies, I believe it may have been a custom order. He really liked his, and didn't have a reaction to any of the food, which is a thumbs up. I hate to leave negative reviews but I just wasn't feeling after the guy was a little abrasive. I WILL go back again because I know people have good and bad days and life happens. The smoothie I had was great however. It was a pretty busy place so I look forward to trying it again. Will update review then."}
{"text":"Ya know, sometimes when a restaurant is slow you'd expect them to be on their game. However, this was not the case. As my family and I waited for 30 minutes for our food the staff had no sense of urgency to check on our order. Once we got our food and realized we were still missing some food I informed the staff and once again there was no urgency to get us the rest. 

When I asked the staff why our food was taking so long they gave me a sorry excuse. I use to work in the food industry so I'm not stupid. I feel pretty confident in saying that they probably forgot my order or messed it up but instead told me it was the pizza dough.  

Btw- I order the same pizza every single visit and at other locations. I've never had this problem before. 
Luckily, this location isn't my normal go to."}
{"text":"Healthy spot! Quick, easy and decently priced! 

My office ordered take-out from here earlier this week. I have never been inside the restaurant even though I live around the corner from it. Sometimes when you go to a restaurant that is known as being healthy can be a little disheartening because you think it will ONLY be salads! Greens and Proteins has burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches, smoothies, juices, etc! There are so many options! 

I ordered the Veggie Burger and Crispy Tofu. It was by far one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had. It could have been the cashews added to the burger, but it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It made you feel good about eating it. The avocado, lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and hit the spot. The crispy tofu was delicious too. I want to try the jicama fries next time! 

Definitely a spot to go to again!"}
{"text":"So much grease in this burrito ,the grease is dripping from it , this is the second time I come here smh never again ,"}
{"text":"I saw this on my way into Zabbas last week and mentally bookmarked this place.  I am always down to try a new place that is supposedly healthy.   Wow, was I surprised.  In the first 48 hours I had eaten here for lunch, dinner and lunch again!

Walking into the place was a little daunting.  This place was so busy that there was literally a line out the door.  All the tables were filled and we were worried we'd have nowhere to sit.  This place is very hectic loud like a high school cafeteria!   The floors are nicely tiled, the tables are high end wood, as are the chairs.  There are booths along a window that, if one can grab, are pretty comfortable to sit at.

The menu consists of Breakfast items (until 11am), Soups, Salads, Pizzas, BURGERS and Wraps/Sandwiches.  Calorie Counts are next to their popular items!  To drink, there is your standard coke fountain with a dedicated dispenser for WATER.  :)

The place is very busy, but still manages to be clean.  There are no trashcans in sight, you just leave your table and the staff quickly cleans up after you.

The first time out I ordered the Ostrich Burger with Swiss Cheese and Tofu Fries.  Despite the cost of being over $15 for my order, it was delicious and I felt it was well worth it.  The burger was a tiny bit dry, but delicious nonetheless.  Burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato and onion.  The tofu fries were unique.  I wasn't impressed at first but I later realized it was because the fries weren't cooked all the way and it was still squishy in the middle.  This meal I would rate a 8 out of 10.

Later that night I came back again and the place seemed to be less busy.  This time I ordered the Turkey Wrap with bacon and a spinach tortilla and Jicama fries (it's like eating a raw apple sliced up like fries).  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  I loved it - I was very impressed.

On to my next meal here at lunch:  This time I ordered the Bison Burger Swiss cheese, medium rare with Jicama Fries.  The burger was just the right amount of juicy absolutely incredible.   Where else can you eat a burger like this guilt free?  I also ordered a Green Leaf Berry Blast shake with almond milk.  It was very good and satisfied my cravings for fresh fruit.

Be warned, however.  Buying a shake with one of their meals is like eating two meals in one.  I was completely stuffed by the end of my visit.

Today for lunch I ordered the Turkey Burger with Swiss and half Jicama fries, half tofu fries.  To drink I got the Apple Pie Smoothie with Almond milk.  I was impressed with the burger.  Very juicy and tasty.  The Jicama fries are spot on.  Just like eating an apple again and served raw with paprika.  The Tofu fries this time however was even better than I remembered.  This is because they were actually cooked all the way through.  If I can get tofu fries prepared like this again, I think Jicama is in trouble!  On the other hand, the Apple Pie Smoothie left more to be desired. I am not a fan of this.

I am sure to visit again to try the Bison Wrap with Spinach tortilla.  My friends have all been getting it, but before I settle into my \"norm\" i wanted to try as much as possible here.  If my norm is the bison wrap, so be it. :) 

This place has definitely earned a solid top entry for my work lunch rotation.

I am only giving four stars for a simple reason: the guy that took my order at the register the past two times doesn't seem very friendly at all. Not a smile; not even a forced smile - it's like I'm bothering him when ordered.  On top of that, I don't EVER get a receipt from him or even offered a water cup.  The other guy, who appears to be either a manager or owner is very friendly and helpful.

Other suggestions to the owners if you are reading: You need more tables and seating - It appears the suite next to you is empty, consider expanding. :)"}
{"text":"The Wellness Juice is by far the best and biggest size green juice I have had. The menu has something for everyone, carnevors to vegans."}
{"text":"This location is extremely inconsistent (wrong side, no dressing or sauce on multiple ocassions and sometimes the salmon is raw and sometimes it's jerky) and the girls at the register are snotty. The last 3 times I have ordered to go, my food isn't ready when I get here  (20mins as stated on phone), I pay and sit and wait on my food. I see the cook bring my food out, tell them the name on the order and they let it sit on the counter. They are too busy conversing amongst themselves to do their job. Then when I go to the counter and tell them it's been sitting, they try and make lame excuses. I watched the whole thing play out. I can not stand poor customer service. I'm done with the Rainbow location."}
{"text":"The options are so good. I loved my green shake and my burger. Eating with out feeling guilty and doing my body good. What more can anyone say ?"}
{"text":"Quick, healthy and delicious option in Vegas!! Love this place for paleo eating.  They even have bison burgers!  I'm hooked."}
{"text":"I really just love this place. The best part is my 9 year old daughter loves the place as well. Their egg whites out beat my made at home egg whites and the juices are AMAZING - the agave:) greens and proteins is always a fun stop after a work out with the girls:) I also love that their loyalty card is one my phone apps so I don't have to worry about losing and searching for a card in my clutter wherever it may be!"}
{"text":"Meh.

The food was just ok. Salmon was fishy and dry. Quinoa was bland. Not worth the price and not nearly as good as some of the new fancy fast salad places popping up. 

The staff was friendly, though."}
{"text":"I eat here at aminimum once per week. The food is good and healthy.  I will continue to eat here"}
{"text":"Terrible service. My husband waited for +20 minutes for 2 smoothies while another lady after my husband ordered received hers."}
{"text":"The service at the N. Decatur store was unbelievably slow!  There were four in our group.  Two meals were delivered after 10 minutes, one meal after 20 minutes, and the final meal almost 30 minutes from when we placed our order.  None of the orders were special orders and many people who ordered after us got their food quickly and before us.  We will NOT support this business inthe future and will share our experience with our friends and family.  Neither of the girls behind the counter seemed to be bothered that the service was slow."}
{"text":"There are so many great things about Thai place where do I begin. The the Thai ginger soup is the best things about coming here. Have it with whatever you get as a first course. The salads are always made to order so they are never droopy. I eat the kale salad and add shrimp. My husband gets Chicken pizza or bison burger always satisfies him. Your fresh choices are endless this is a gem of a place!"}
{"text":"We have been to another store. But could not drive there because we did not rent a car. We showed up well before closing and they had sent everyone home except two people and turned off the grills. Uber ride waste. Disappointed to say the least. Door says open till 5 it was only 215."}
{"text":"This place has roaches and I have the pictures to prove it
I've come to this location for a very long time and I like the food but lately I've seen roaches and I am no longer coming back to this location, the service is horrible also, never coming back"}
{"text":"One of the best and most creative \"healthy\" places to grab a casual bite in town. The servers are always friendly and the menu has TONS of options."}
{"text":"Awesome selection but the ketchup has high fructose corn  syrup...for the price, I expect more.  Still would highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Chicken breast, sweet potato, avocado after a workout.. Boom. Food is terrific as well. Get a good fresh meal for 10-15 bucks. Definitely going to be eating here too often..."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get great service & pay great prices. They always give me suggestions due to my cravings & they always hit it spot on! The place is always packed with people... they are definitely doing something right. I will continue to come back and be a loyal Greens & Proteins customer."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for anyone on a low carb (or healthy carb) diet. Not only did I enjoy my meal, everything everybody else was eating seemed appealing. 
Can't wait for this model to grow so we can have something like Greens and Proteins in Reno."}
{"text":"Appropriately named, Greens and Proteins cooks up some of the best tasting healthy dining options I've had in a while. 

Decided to stop by after hitting the gym and was not disappointed at the quality of the wood. G&P puts a healthy spin on a lot of popular dishes: burgers (available in beef, ostrich, turkey or veggie), pizzas, sandwiches, salads and a huge assortment of smoothies and health drinks. The food is delicious, the BBQ chicken or Greek pizzas are a sizable portion yet unbelievably low in calories. G&P is one of the few places nearby to get fresh squeezed juices, and their parfaits are awesome.

The downside is that Greens is a bit overpriced. During my last trip I opted to get a chicken Teriyaki wrap and at $11 I thought it was very overpriced. I guess this what you can charge for healthy food when you are right across the street for a LVAC. Staff and service is fine for an eatery of this size. Greens and Proteins is definitely worth checking out as one of the few clean eating spots in town."}
{"text":"Coming here on a Friday night, it was quite; however, for some reason, the service was really slow. I ordered a veggie burger with tofu fries and we had to wait about 20 minutes . The food was delicious so I guess it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"A \"healthy\" spot, conveniently located nearby an LVAC on the 215 and Flamingo, it provides a great place to go get some post work out food. They provide a great variety of what would be considered health foods and healthy shakes. Something I would recommend is their bison cheesesteak. It would be a favorite among anyone that tries it, and a favorite among customers. You can make your own meal, so you can try many different combinations of food and try things here that you wouldn't have otherwise. The only downside to m is the pricetag, it can be a little pricy, but this hits a specific niche of people that will spend the money to eat at a place like this. You may not enjoy the price, but you definitely will enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Herbivore Score = 2 stars
Carnivore Score = 4 stars
Overall Score = 3 stars

Herbivore Review
Herby ordered a build-your-own plate with marinated tofu, quinoa and edamame. As a vegan, Herby asked about vegan sauces, the employee at the register didn't seem super confident but perfectly friendly. Tofu was a bit mushy and had no marinated flavor. Quinoa was really watery like it hadn't been properly strained. Edamame was good. The portion size looked small on the plate, but was actually filling. Cost was $10, wouldn't order again.

Carnivore Review
Carno ordered the bison cheesesteak in a cabbage wrap with tofu fries with water cup. The meat was really tasty and well flavored. Everything was really fresh and clean-tasting. At a lot of restaurants like this, there are issues with portion size, but this place has great portion size (3 handfuls worth of food) and macro cost. Definitely recommend a fork since it will fall apart as you eat (like all leaf wraps do). Cost was $11-12, would order again.

Overall
Food was ready in less than 10 minutes and total cost was about $25 with tax. The number of vegan options is above 5, so high enough for Herby to return. Carno enjoyed the food, it's definitely a good place to go if you want to feel full without killing your ratios for the day."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and at 2 other locations couple of times. Have never been disappointed with any dish, but I do have my favorites. Harvest Kale salad is my \"go to\" lunch choice, even though Kale is usually described as \"hard to stomach\" by most - this is not the case, this salad is absolutely delicious. My hubby usually gets the bison burger with tofu fries - and it's finger-licking good!! 
Place always looks spotless, which is very important. the staff is always very courteous and helpful - seems they enjoy working there, that says a lot to me too :)"}
{"text":"Yum and yum. A haven in strip mall hell. I had mixed plate and it was so flavorful and healthy."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here because I like the named Greens and Protiens HEALTHY KITCHEN AND JUICD BAR even on BEAT THE IRISH week.  The menu is extensive selection of healthy choices.  My favorite is all the calorie intake information for transparency on what it is you are actually eating.  I would come back again this place is tasty indeed."}
{"text":"I didn't eat at this establishment but I did stop in.....check out the menu....and talk to the staff about their VEGAN options. It goes without saying they have all the usual healthy items and the prices didn't seem to bad. This particular location is right down the street from my timeshare property so I just wanted to let all my VEGAN followers they do have a healthy option in Spring Valley if they are looking for one. The establishment is very clean.....staff is friendly.....location is easy to find....and I think there is plenty on the menu for both Vegetarians and VEGANS alike.

Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I'm in this neck of the Summerlin woods, this is definitely my go-to in a pinch. 

The service is speedy, and the food is delish. 

Nothing fancy, but there are lots of healthy, cheap options. I had the bacon and eggs (so paleo), and the portions were pretty big. My friend had the protein pancakes. She couldn't finish them. I had a bite, and so yummy!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I love to eat healthy food.  The Green Ginger Limeade was very good - no complaints about the taste, just the price.  $5.99 for a drink is too much for me.  Then I ordered the Turkey Burger wrapped in lettuce.  The presentation was nice, but it tasted terrible.  The meat was either under cooked or just had a nasty gamey taste. I tried to cover up the flavor of the meat with ketsup and mustard.  My total bill was $17.27.  Too expensive to eat food that tastes bad."}
{"text":"I always go to Greens and Proteins but this is my first time at this location. First there were no clean silverware. I ordered the Egg White scramble with turkey sausage. The presentation was wack and the sausage was not fully cooked it was ice cold on the inside. I let the manager or cook know and he gave me a free lunch on him on my next visit due to the inconvenience. I was cool with that."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch, dinner or a smoothie and the owner Greg is a great guy aswell. Love to come in and have some bison or a chicken teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"I love the green shake from here and I also love that bison burger! Prices are a little high but it's worth it. Food is money here! Nothing special about the atmosphere. It could be something more if they added a little bit more of a home feel instead of fast food. Could be a very successful restaurant instead of a pit stop in between going home and the gym."}
{"text":"Listen up! If you want healthy, tasty and affordable - then here's a run down of a few routine healthy favorites from the menu which I rely on: chicken tacos (3 hearty tacos for only 410cals), wellness drink (more like a green smoothie packed with nutrients and fills you up), the build-your-own (bison burger patty or the grilled salmon)!"}
{"text":"I have been craving a turkey burger for like the passed two weeks. So used my yelp search to find me a turkey burger. So I decided to try greens & proteins! I will say it's very cute and clean, it wasn't too busy and they make your food to order and they are very friendly. My burger was delicious my only thing is that I wish they had more flavor...seasoning salt. I also liked the soda...stubborn soda...the best! Will go again love that it's so close to my house too."}
{"text":"I  love this place! The staff is very friendly with helping you decide what u want to eat. It was my first time here and this place will be a routine stop for me. I ordered the salmon with fresh broccoli and sweet potato mash. I was very happy with what came out of the kitchen. Then salmon was prepared perfectly. Again this place is fast, healthy, and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"First time to Greens and Proteins after wanting to go for like forever and it exceeded my expectations!! I got the wellness juice, which was refreshing and great, and then blueberry cream cheese crepes that were just so amazing and delicious!! Can't wait to go back and try something else!! Staff was super friendly and helped me pick my meal, which I really appreciated!"}
{"text":"Love the extensive healthy menu.  The frittata, egg wrap and multigrain pancakes were outstanding.  Couple of disappointments: stevia is put in EVERY juice and smoothie.  The whole point of juices is to NOT have added sweeteners.  And the other thing was agave served with pancakes instead of real maple syrup.  Had to pay $4 for a little plastic condiment size container of maple syrup.  Service was indifferent and unfriendly on first visit.  Cheerful and accommodating the next.  Will be back for the healthy food choices."}
{"text":"Healthy as you want it. You can go a healthy ahi tuna taco or a big fat burger even vegetarian if that's your thing. Sometimes I like to eat a vegetarian meal I am a carnivore and a herbivore. Lol  It's a fresh and yummy change to get fast food that's not going to make you sluggish for the rest of the day. Also the smoothies are some of the best in Las Vegas. It's downtown so parking is tricky for most. I ride my bike there so not for me there is a bike rack right outside. Definitely one of my favorite lunchtime spots."}
{"text":"As my first venture out after being diagnosed celiac I was not disappointed with their gluten free items! Walking into Greens & Protiens has a very homelike clean feel. It almost seems like it should be in Southern California. They have a large assortment of healthy items on their menu such as shakes, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. I decided to try the green leaf berry blast shake (carrots, kale, berries, spinach, soy milk, agave nectar, and vanilla extract) I've been every day for the past 5 days since for this shake its so delicious! I also tried the Greek pizza on gluten free crust.. YUM! Hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. The crust is actually amazing too it's almost like a flatbread. I will be suggesting this place to everyone and I can't wait for their 2nd location on Flamingo and the 215 to open! See you all there :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local hangouts. It has an informal, upbeat atmosphere, and healthy, delicious food. All the salads are great, but the wraps and burgers are excellent, too. My kids love the buffalo burgers. I am a fan of the smoothies, which have lots of greens that do not overwhelm the taste. If you go for lunch, it is best to get there early during the week as it gets pretty busy. At the weekend, it's a great choice for brunch or evening meal and not too crowded. There is outside seating available, too."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Also the smoothies. Nice workers. It's easy to get to and they are fast. I really love the decor, it's bright and happy. We got the green shake and the choc peanut butter banana, both amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I come here after a work out at Vegas hot.  My favorite is the chicken salad yummy"}
{"text":"I had their buffalo chicken wrap on a spinach wrap for $10.99. They were generous with their buffalo sauce but it wasn't overwhelming. The blue cheese was so good. They put chunks--not small chunks but a good size chunk--of blue cheese. The wrap was really good.

I got the meal with tofu fries. The fries were pretty chunky and had flavor but not really a fan of tofu anyway. 

The service was good. A quick in and out. Would come back again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm glad they opened up a spot closer to where I live. Usually I'd have to drive to the one on eastern and it's always busy. At least here it's not too crazy yet. I usually just get the turkey burger with jicama fries . Soooo tasty and my husband loves the bbq chicken pizza. The staff is always on point with their customer service. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Extremely impressed. I haven't been here in about 8 months, but the quality of food has grown exponentially. I got the seasonal chopped salad, it was absolutely perfect. The portion was perfect and it was clean. Absolutely worth it"}
{"text":"So stoked it's finally opened! Had an amazing first experience. Everyone was really nice, place was clean and food was bomb"}
{"text":"For the enthusiast that is big on nutrition but short on flavor. 

It was a nice atmosphere initially in coming into the restaurant. The menu was very self explanatory but was not very unique.  

I got the Turkey Club and my husband got the Bison Wrap. There wasn't a lot of flavoring either of the dishes unfortunately. On a positive note the sweet potato fries were good. 

We wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and try their smoothies. We got the chocolate peanut butter and banana with additional disappointment. We were so let down with all the good comments about this place. Not expecting to ever go again but it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times.  For a occasional bite to eat I have no problems.  I was eating some of the build your owns. I decided to see how many calories it actually was......   You give a cup of brown rice.  Your menu states that it is 159 calories. It should be about 200.  Read a box of brown rice.  Chicken breast I weighed it at 5-6 oz cooked. Which is 6-8 raw.  That should be about 340 calories. 40-50 calories uncooked per ounce not 272."}
{"text":"This very inconspicuous restaurant is tucked away in the corner by Del Taco. I have lived in North Vegas for going on three years and have been curious about it but not enough to try it. Boy, have I been missing out. 

Finally ordered take out and I must say I was impressed with the quality of the food and taste. The satay Thai chicken had humongous cuts of tender chicken in not-too-sweet peanut sauce. There were tons of cucumbers that were strung like an accordian. Wasn't sure if I was supposed to pull the cucumbers apart or they should have been cut up. The deliciousness of this dish is a fast favorite. Super-huge portions of chicken deliciousness.

The margerita pizza was a bit bland-I would have preferred more basil but it was still good. The acai smoothie was very good and not too sweet. I definitely would like to dine in and see what that was like.

 One star taken off due to the fact that I wasn't thanked when picking up my food. And people wonder why fast food joints are going to computerized kiosks. Sorry to be harsh but at least a thank-you would have been written on the screen. If you don't like to be hospitable, get out of that line of work because a business owner depends on that congeniality."}
{"text":"Great protein pancakes and french toast! Nice small breakfast place with tons of healthy options"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! Their pizzas are great and their wraps are very good too. My favorite is the California Chicken wrap, it comes with a side of tofu fries and you'd never guess it was tofu. They're crispy and well seasoned. My favorite drink is the green smoothie, it's refreshing and you can barely taste the greens. Check this place out, their menu is healthy and the prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"I finally tried the ostrich burger, and it is excellent!  I had an apple pie smoothie with it and that was very good. I've had a few of the other shakes here as well, and they are all good, but  none of them 'wow' me.  Then again, I'm really not much of a shake person.  Oh, and the tofu fries are very tasty. Same cannot be said for the jicama fries. 

It is a pricey dining experience.  My ostrich and apple pie smoothie cost me $24.31.  That meal was definitely worth the experience, but I wouldn't pay that much to experience it again.  This place is a rare visit for me."}
{"text":"I like that most of the menu items have the calories listed. Calories for tofu fries vs. jicama \"fries\" were not listed, but the helpful person at the counter was able to tell me. Nice, helpful employees. I got an extra lean angus beef burger, and it was delicious. I always enjoy having a healthier option. Certainly not cheap though."}
{"text":"This place may be a bit pricier than your average, run of the mill corporate fast food joint but be aware that this is no ordinary establishment and that the extra dollars are well worth it. The quality of the ingredients really speaks for itself and the healthiness, which may be a major selling point for some, was really just a bonus for me. 

I opted to try the bison cheese steak on a wheat bun, which seems to be a popular option. It came with a side of \"fries\" and I chose the Jica, having never heard of them before. The girl at the register was friendly and willing to explain the various menu items. Much of the menu is vegan or vegetarian but not all of it-- it offers plenty of options for the carnivores so don't let that deter you from visiting.

The food was pretty impressive. The bun was hearty and filling, and the the actual bison meat was just as tasty as any beef I've ever had in a philly cheese steak. The sandwich itself is filling enough but does come with the fries. I probably will try the tofu fries next time because the jica \"fries\" were really just raw sliced vegetables that provided the optical illusion of fries but tasted nothing like them. The chef who started this place has a great philosophy about making food that is both healthy and delicious and I daresay he has executed it perfectly.

I will definitely be coming back here and hope to try some of the smoothies as well as the wide assortment of salads and sauces."}
{"text":"this place is a little pricey, but everything is healthy and fresh. cant go wrong with the Wellness Drink as a post workout!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to have in the north!!  We ordered the steak salad and ostrich Burger .  There steak salad Jade candied walnuts and blue cheese along with an onion vinaigrette.  The Burger came with a side of choice.  We will detonator come back!! Marc was very helpful and have is a sampler of the wellness drink.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here after a reflexology session and I feel like my relaxation was extended! Had a smoothie and the grilled buffalo chicken strips. They were amazing. The smoothie was delicious! All of their food is healthy and from what I can tell, tasty! Will definitely be trying this place again! Thank you for bringing a clean \"fast\" food establishment to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant for all those health choices!! I mean everything is good too. The staff is super courteous and helpful. This is the place I go for great tasting healthy foods of all types. And has awesome smoothies too!! Everything is made right on the spot and that doesn't take too long either!! I could eat here everyday  :)"}
{"text":"There are so many reasons to love Greens and Proteins! 1st, I am gluten intolerant and it limits my choices when I dine out. The menu offers so many choices and combinations that it is refreshing not to beg for menu accommodations. 2nd, I am calorie conscious so I like that there were so many excellent healthy options that were appealing. 3rd The menu covers selections from raw to meat therefore everyone is happy, and no one compromises. 4th The prices are great, you can keep it low and not have to eat a side salad. 5th I saw the cucumber lemon water and found out that was free! 6th, I loved my choice! I decided to have the frittata with turkey and fontina cheese and it was delicious. It was served with a salad with watermelon. The portion was generous and  I cant wait to return again. 7th I was so happy to have a reuseable plastic plate and silverware which is nice not to eat off of paper etc...

As far  as ambiance, it is all open air, it is very casual. There are  flat scrrenTV's with a variety of shows.  We enjoyed sitting outside, there is a parking lot  so keep in mind it is casual"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped into Greens and Proteins for a post-work out second breakfast of a \"healthier\" fare. 

The Southwest Tofu & Chorizo Burrito caught my eye; the idea sounded interesting, and so did its description: scrambled tofu and soy chorizo, tomatoes, cilantro, and Anaheim chilies, wrapped in a spinach tortilla. A side of tofu home fries originally comes with this, but you can replace that with another side listed on their menu. Also, you can choose to sub the tortilla with lettuce. With that being said, the burrito only looks good on paper. In this case, I would've preferred actual meat than the tofu because of the spices and ingredients. 

One cool thing to mention about this place is that the calories for each of the menu items -- excluding breakfast -- are listed. Prices for foods seem reasonable, much more reasonable than other \"healthy\" eateries by my gym. They do make smoothies and juices here, but I think $7.50 for a smoothie is too much, even with a Yelp check-in for $1.00 off."}
{"text":"Perfect post gym meals. Ostrich burger and a Wellness with extra ginger FTW."}
{"text":"Really liked the Vegas Pizza. I guess for Vegas its a pretty good Vegan/Healthy rest."}
{"text":"The concept excited me. Healthier, lower calorie vegan//vegetarian options served alongside healthier, lower calorie meaty options - a place I could go with my meat-eater friends and not feel jipped. 

The above concept is really all that was exciting for me at Greens and Protein. Unfortunately, the food was rather bland. 

I ordered the plate with tofu (protein), asparagus (green) and quinoa. The quinoa tasted literally like quinoa. No seasoning, nothing. Likewise, the asparagus failed to incite even a slight quiver in my taste buds. The tofu was passable - but I'll eat tofu made any way. 

My husband ordered the raw mock chicken lettuce cups. I actually found this dish offensive and puny in serving size. But my husband liked it. 

One of my friends ordered the bison burger which he relished and the other one, a similar plate like mine but with a grilled portobello mushroom instead of quinoa. The mushroom was actually very good. 

We shared the tofu fries - quite good but I really wish they weren't fried. What's the point of a healthy meal? 

The drinks were ridiculously priced so I refused to have any. 

All in all...nice concept, progressive for Vegas and a place you could hang if you were on a strict caloric diet. But being satisfied with your meal...that's another story."}
{"text":"Wasn't a super big fan of the Acai sorbet in my Acai bowl. I don't understand why places don't blend the Acai fresh and mix it with some fruit and juice or hemp milk or whatever. Just seems super lazy to me and it's not as good. There are better spots in Las Vegas I would rather spend time driving too."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. 10% off if you have membership with LVAC or Military. Food is more on the expensive side for me but it's well worth it. They got some of this cucumber water, it's strange since I've never had it lol. Place is really clean and looks brand new. 

P.S ; They're sweet potatoes fries are SOOOOO DAMN GOOD, YOU MUST TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"Tastes like heaven.  May be a bit pricey at first but then you realize what you are actually paying for...QUALITY.  This is the future of \"fast food\".  Join the revolution.

Green shake is the go to, if you have never been."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone always has an inviting attitude and it makes the atmosphere welcoming. I ALWAYS get A+ service and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Feta scramble with tofu fries was good. The smoothies are all a little over priced. I still frequent there because of the limited options for similar type of food in eastern. The service is great and fast service. Which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time here today. I had a large Cesar's Salad that was really good and I must say the quality of the lettuce was pretty good compare to other places. The large salad was more than enough for me. My husband put his own plate together with some chicken and quinoa, and he liked it. I don't want to give it a 5 star yet, because all I had was a salad. The staff was also pretty helpful. 
Maybe one thing, they cleaned of the tables nicely, but also don't forget the bench where some people drop food on!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Greens and Proteins before the hype of it all. Honestly, the place has gotten really crowded, however, everyone who works there has exceptional service and is extremely friendly, and the food is STILL good! I love ordering everything they have & they seem to give a pretty good portion! I love ordering their pizzas, if I ever crave Domino's and I can't eat Domino's lol. Their burgers are EXTREMELY hefty and filling and I just love the whole set up of it all!

Look: wooden tables, waterfall walls, tv's displaying most sport shows and news stations, good music, and different kinds of condiments! 

Fave food: Pizzas, burgers, breakfast, smoothies"}
{"text":"Great healthy food and the WELLNESS drink is amazing.  
The tofu fries didn't blow me away, but the bison burger is really good.
Friendly staff & cute atmosphere. 
Free wifi. Great place to relax whenever the Starbucks next door is too busy (which is always).
Price isn't outrageous for the quality of food.

I look forward to coming here every time I am back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I lived close by and I'm always getting takeout. Everything I've had from wraps, salads to smoothies never disappoints I love the jicama fries too. The employees are always fast and welcoming"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, place clean , food delicious! I loved Thai ginger soup and veggie burger. It's a great place to eat good food !"}
{"text":"Love greens and proteins. I've been coming here since I moved to vegas. I even saw Marie Osmond there one time. I like how hey give you a huge flat bread for under 400 calories enough for 2 meals. Not a fan of their acia bowls but their sister company down the street has great ones so they should bring the acia bowl from over there to this location"}
{"text":"Came here after the gym absolutely needing something quick. I wasnt feeling well and knew I needed something but nothing on the menu really grabbed me. I decided on the watermelon raspberry \"shake\". It's really not a shake, more like a pulpy drink and it was really good. The place is clean, the service was quick, but I think it's pretty pricey. My shake was just about $7. This could be a place I'd frequent often but it's definitely too pricey for me. The woman ahead of me commented that they are more expensive than Whole Foods! Yikes!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food. The turkey sausage and egg whites are my favorite!  Give it a try"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time! If I could everyday, I would! The staff is always so helpful and friendly. The BYO(Build Your Own - Protein, grains, Vegetable and Sauce) is my go-to! It's always fresh and a great size meal/proportions for the price, dinner or lunch. Their juices and smoothies are delicious as well. Highly recommend for clean eating!"}
{"text":"Best healthy kitchen spot in Vegas!!! The service is spectacular, and the food is incredible. I'm hooked!! I'm so happy my sister recommended this juice bar to me!! :-) :-) :-)"}
{"text":"I love the fast casual/quality food/healthy food concept. The execution can be a bit spotty and the food, while decent, won't make you forget about all the unhealthy (and more delicious) alternatives around town. The BBQ pizza was ok, but the crust was too soft and doughey. The bison cheesesteak wrap was good but I couldn't help but fantasize about biting into a real Philly cheesesteak while eating it. The girl behind the counter raved about the tofu fries but I wasn't a fan. I've never been much of a tofu fan and the fries failed to convert me.

My favorite part of their menu is the \"Build your own custom meal\" where you pick a protein, grain, green, and sauce of your choosing. It's perfect for when you want a quick meal, don't feel like cooking, and aren't in the mood for traditional fast food. The pork tenderloin with the balsamic reduction was good, but the portabello mushroom was overcooked. Portion sizes are on the small side so don't expect to walk away full. 

There may be some drawbacks to this place, but it's still a good option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"It's usually pretty busy, but at least I've never been disappointed by their smoothies. I always get the wellness drink. Definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"Good smoothies, the menu is little limited but is good. 
My favorite flat bread and most of the smothies. 
Very good location"}
{"text":"It's hard to eat healthy when you are one the road for work, so imagine my surprise when I found Greens and Proteins!

This place is an anomoly in Vegas, where the level of obesity rivals any in America.  It is full of Vegan hipsters,granola munching anti-gluteners, and fitness junkies.  I felt like I had been transported to Santa Cruz or Berkeley!

I ordered a chicken parmagian from their daily specials - it was created with a leaning towards Paleo: spaghetti squash topped with chicken breast and covered in a marinara and (this parts not Paleo) cheeses.   It came with a side dish of cooked fresh spinach, which I topped with a basalmic reduction.  The spaghetti squash was well drained and cooked perfectly - when I make it at home, it's squishy and unevenly cooked!  The marinara had a nice fresh flavor and the cheeses were melted in goey goodness.  The spinach was plain so I requested a vinegar to top it with - the friendly and creative 'waiter' suggested the basalmic.

The service was friendly and helpful - I'm definitely coming back when I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Where do I start........been staying at the Juhl for over a year. First time I came to this place it was good. I only ordered a açaí berry smoothie though. Next time I go I decide to order a filet mignon steak salad. That was good! Third time I go and order the same exact salad dressing was different and they decide to cut my steak into tiny little pieces, nothing like the photo on the website or on the front of the store. Not only that I always order my steak 'medium', which means I should see some pink. They don't charge me for it, great! Next time I order a steak for me and my mom. It was fine, but she had more lettuce than anything else. Decided to not complain again. On her visit to come see me, she decides to order the filet mignon steak salad again. Told me it wasn't made like it was the last time. Fast forward to today and I order the same filet mignon steak salad which has now been raised in price and has been to changed to a regular steak. salad. Wait about 10mim for my food and was given a free drink for the hike in price that's never stated anywhere in this location nor the website. Order the steak medium again and they have the nerve to not even cut it up this time. Just throw two small medallions on top. Call to ask why and in the future to let the cook know the steak should be sliced and made to look like the picture for $18. Slice the steak and it's well done...........literally have to go back down to have them remake my steak. NEVER EVER SPENDING ANOTHER DOLLAR IN THIS PLACE. The least you can do is get the residents order right the first time. Oh let's not forget they're always slow no matter what time you go annnnndddddddd they no longer deliver. All these changes within a years time. Nope!!!! Spending my money elsewhere because I'm tired of being disappointed for just a damn salad.



Before I forget I've ordered breakfast here too and never had a problem with the breakfast. So that's that!"}
{"text":"I love the concept, yet every time I try and give this place a try I am always disappointed. Menu items are not an accurate description of the actual meals. They focus to much on the aesthetics versus the taste. I really wanted to like you but with poor customer service, small servings and mediocre taste, I must say good bye. I tired and you failed."}
{"text":"Had the protein pancakes.  Pretty good. Asked for the healthiest drink they and was told the \"wellness\". Everything was really good.   Service was great. Sure tasted mighty good for s healthy drink.  Wifey got the watermelon strawberry cocktail. That was just as good. Good clean location.  Close to home.  I can't wait to come back for the ostrich burgers and bison burgers.  Prices are decent.  Service is great.  They give you free \"lime cucumber water to drink\".  Top notch baby!!!"}
{"text":"Struck gold when I found this place. Drove by it often but never really knew what it was. I'm so glad I finally went in to check it out. First of all they have Breakfast, Lunch, & Dinner which is very rare (7am-10pm). The staff was amazing and very friendly from start to finish. The selection of food was very thorough and extremely healthy.  I went for lunch, then came back the following morning for breakfast. The food was great every time, the custom juice were very healthy & unique too. They're located right next to the LVAC gym so it's the perfect pre/post workout spot to grab a meal. They also do meal prep too (looking forward to trying that soon as well).  Very impressed. I'll definitely be back here again (and again)."}
{"text":"Came here for a healthy breakfast, we ordered our food our server was nice but she talked very low we could burly hear her it made it difficult to ask her questions about the menu. I had the wellness drink and it was delicious my husband ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap it came with sweet potatoes fries, he let me tried it and was also very good. The place is awesome I love how it looks from the outside and the inside is also very nice. I will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"I came to Vegas for my birthday week and I wanted to eat something healthy. So we came here (less than 10 minutes from airport). Bf ordered angus beef burger. The patty itself was probably bigger than both pieces of the wheat bun. And from the one bite I had, it's the leanest/lightest yet best tasting beef I've had. Granted I'm not a burger person. But it was good and not greasy. And my acai bowl was so tasty and good with the perfect variation of fruit."}
{"text":"I ordered my food through postmates mind you but my food was disgusting! Veggie patty, portobello mushroom, sauces and the basmati rice was flavorless and dry, the portobello was slimy and the teriyaki sauce didnt help at all!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect after a good workout...Today was actually my second time here. The first time I had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was ok. And tonight  I had the bbq pizza and it was sooooooo good !! Service is always great...  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, but the service is extremely slow. I waited 20 minutes for a wrap that should have taken 5 min or less. The staff seems to work with no sense of urgency or respect for the patron's time."}
{"text":"Greens & Proteins is amazing, hands down. It's the only place I go when I'm looking for a bite to eat and want to eat healthy. So many places have tried the health conscious menu and the end result is flavorless food (Lyfe Kitchen) but everything I've had here is delicious. The bison wrap w/ tofu fries is my favorite. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not bad...not the best either for price.  The salad dressings are terrible which ruins tge salads...for that reason would be reluctant to return"}
{"text":"The Ahi Tuna Tostadas and Acai Berry Smoothie is pure heaven! The service is always great at this location. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Very clean and cheerful environment. This is a great spot if you are in a hurry but you don't want \"fast food\" . I keep coming back to this place! They know my drink now"}
{"text":"Great attitude of employees.  Great service.  FABULOUS greens drink.  Made the best way .. In a vitamix.  Great choice!!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Ask for Steve-o . Try there bison steak wrap and ask for the House bbq sauce"}
{"text":"Very healthy! They have all fresh organic breakfast and lunch items, hours mon-sun 7a-10p. A variety of raw juices. What I love about the menu is that you're able to customize your meal. i.e choose your protein, greens, grains and sauce. Have I mentioned it's healthy?!!! Yum"}
{"text":"So excited to have a Greens & Proteins downtown. I love that they have an extensive menu and a build your meal option. The interior looks nice and the service is really friendly. This will be my new go to spot for lunch."}
{"text":"So I decided to go her after my workout for something different.  I got the Feta cheese pizza, it had olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, and low fat mozzarella chees.  I go it on the thin crust bread, or what ever it is. 
I was very impressed.  It was so good!  I will be back.   And it's only 247 calories, for a 10 inch pizza."}
{"text":"I've been coming to greens & proteins for a while now & every time I come its such an AMAZING experience! Over all the variety food that they have the protein pancakes are the best!!! I can eat them any time of the day. 
Chef Caesar is always very pleasant and takes time to explain the ingredients in the meal, which I appreciate.  Will definitely continue coming back..."}
{"text":"OMG wow! This place was so amazing! I'm not even the type of girl that enjoys eating healthy but this place actually was not that bad. I'm not even a big fan of Tofu yet I was munching on Tofu fries and let's not even get me started on how freaking bomb the barbecue pizza was... Like man oh man, I think I might need another Greens and Proteins fix again this week"}
{"text":"I do love this place. Plus it is walking distance from where I do Yoga.

I started my morning with Yoga and then walked across the street for brunch. I walked in and the main color is earth tones and green. They have a kitchen/juice bar open for you to see everything being freshly made.  Clean white counter tops. The tables look like tree trunks. You can sit inside or outside. Very hipster scenery with people grabbing smoothies/coffee while sitting and doing work, having a meeting, etc. People bring their dogs and just relax outside for hours.

My friend and I shared a meal. The lady taking our order seemed the least interested in her job. I was shocked on how someone in just a bland mood could work at such an inspiring lifestyle restaurant. I even asked her for an extra cup, so I could split our smoothie, and gave off an attitude I was asking too much. But her mood was not going to put a damper on my experience. She handed us our # and we proceeded to sit outside to enjoy the day.

My friend and I got a wellness smoothie which was very green but a hint of sweet. This was perfect because I hate sweet. You could taste all the fresh veggies in it.  We also got the veggie burger with the fried tofu fries. The veggie burger was on a wheat bun with onions, tomato, and lettuce (not gross iceberg lettuce). You can do cheddar or swiss cheese or make it vegan and get no cheese. If you got here, YOU MUST try the tofu fries. They are like a steak fry thickness, deep fried with a cajun seasoning. They bring a spicy mayo our but I prefer ketchup.

We sat outside enjoying the beautiful natural sunlight and cool breeze. Our waiter was very polite and brought out food out. He was quick to clean up when we were done. You do not feel pressured to leave but just relax. The waiter saw a lady with a dog working and brought the dog a water bowl. I thought is was a wonderful act of kindness. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been on a health kick. This place is my jam! 

Try the BBQ Chicken pizza. If you order it on the thin crust, it's only 300 calories! 

I also like the wellness drink. It's full of greens but doesn't taste like a bunch of vegetables. It's so good! 

Their staff is friendly and the environment is clean and nice. They only have one line to take orders, so if you get some slow customers in front of you, you're kind of stuck in line for a long time. It would be just a bit faster if there was another register."}
{"text":"The wellness drink is my favorite-- looks way too healthy to taste so good!  Tofu fries are yummy and their protein pancakes are delish!"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Greens and Proteins before but have been to similar restaurants in town and was looking forward to their opening.  It's always nice having another healthy lunch option.  The nutritional information is listed so you know exactly what you are getting.  I ordered the bison wrap which comes with sweet potato fries.  The waiter suggested the house ranch for a dipping sauce.  Service and food was good.  The price point is a little high but the cashier mentioned that they would be offering a discount program.  They do offer a military discount."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via the Yelp website (who owns GrubHub now). GrubHub never picked up our food from the restaurant. When I called them, they said I accidentally ordered pick up. I didn't. The order was specifically for delivery, \"powered by GrubHub\". I've NEVER ordered takeout, and have NEVER toggled the \"take out\" feature upon order placement. 

The customer service gal didn't do anything to help. She said she would call the restaurant. \"What are they going to do?!\" I asked. \"The food has been ready for an hour-they fulfilled their part of the order process.\"

So now my question is this: how the HELL do I Yelp, Yelp? Because in this instance YELP DROPPED THE BALL IN EPIC FASHION and I have no recourse but to poorly rate a restaurant that I love in an attempt to hold Yelp/GrubHub accountable? 

If you have any suggestions on how to handle this matter I welcome your input. Sorry Greens & Proteins! Maybe get your own delivery drivers? Would love your ahi salad about now..."}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious!  The wellness drink is amazing and green!  Pizza, turkey burger, bison steak, ahi tuna.... all great!  Get the tofu fries too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My second trip today and wanted to share. I had the turkey wrap with avocado. Words to describe it, flavorful, balanced, filling. I had a bite of my wife's turkey burger and can't wait to go back for one. Very moist and bursting with flavors. Washed it all down with the cucumber water. Had a few sips of the watermelon strawberry smoothie, another Hilton their menu."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Open spacious awesome decor. Large menu for paleo, raw GF DF and meat hedonists alike. I had the grilled vegetables burger on GF bread with jicama fries.
My eating companion has a big bison cheese burger and was happy. I'd come back many times if I loved here. The caffeinated smoothies looked off the hook! 
Please come to the Bag Area!!"}
{"text":"At this location I've only had the raw macho nachos and the green smoothie but both are amazing and they are really fast here (compared with my experience at the other location, which isn't terribly slow; this place is just faster.)
I really like the raw menu items they offer at both locations and the smoothies are so filling and tasty. Everyone I've brought here for a drink/smoothie wants to go back all the time. Super delicious! :D Oh and the people behind the counter are really nice/positive attitudes - double :D"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go to this location more than the other and it is a little nicer/quieter (but both are great.) 

The option for Pea Protein in smoothies is great for those of us who don't want Whey and don't use Soy (not all that common to have this option for a smoothie.)

The raw menu is amazing - try it all, seriously.

There is something on the breakfast menu with egg whites and turkey sausage that is so clean, healthy, delicious, and filling - not a very common combination (for under $10 to boot :P )"}
{"text":"Finally a location close to where I work! What Iove about greens and proteins is the healthy approach they have for \"fast food\" I'm very health conscious and I don't feel guilty eating here at all! Menu is full of variety for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I love their pizza and Turkey burgers both are affordable, filling, and tasty. When I want to spoil myself I customize my meal. Staff is friendly, and the inside is very colorful and nice at this location. Only issue can be parking during busy hours downtown. Their salads are the only thing I feel need to be revamped, both the flavor and prices are disappointing. The shakes aren't nutritionally balanced in my opinion either, but the flavor is good! Definitely a go to spot for those who want a healthy option when your looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I just love greens and proteins! Everything about this place. Whenever I travel to Vegas this is the number one spot I go to when I'm visiting all my clients. There is always a nice selection of fresh foods and of course the juices! Amazing!! The portion sizes are not something that you would find a claim jumper, thank God, there just right for the average person that's looking for something healthy.
The parking here is super super simple and easy to get in and out of. The staff here is really helpful to help you find anything that you need. Your food is ready and usually less than five minutes and it's hot and delicious.
If you're looking for someplace that's not deep-fried and not slathered in sauces, come here you won't be disappointed.
The reason for the four stars instead of the five is that I think their dining area could use a little bit more revamping. The ambience is fine but the chairs and tables are kind of cheap and flimsy. Not something I prefer to sit on so I usually get takeout. Either way eating there or taking out you're going to be happy!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what the world needs!! Why isn't there one of these on every corner like Starbucks.

This place has a full kitchen of all organic amazing foods and has a full juice and smoothie bar to boot.

When you walk in the door you initially think it's just a juice and smoothie bar and then you take your first breath and realize that smell is intoxicating. You order right there at the counter for the smoothie and the juice bar. Everything is extremely fresh and made to order. So if you want to get a smoothie and someone you're with it wants to grab lunch this is the perfect place to be. There is a pretty simple area to sit and had your lunch, which they bring out to you! Awesome! However the food is a bit on the pricey side. But the quality is worth every penny.

I would beg and plead Reno to open one at home, but I guess until then I'll have to frequent the few locations they have an Vegas.

I recently men's this to greens AND protein lovers alike."}
{"text":"So I usually end up here really sweaty and hungry after a class at Body Heat. I have tried many items from their menu and have enjoyed them all. 
I love their outdoor seating and their spa water is really refreshing. 
The have calories displayed on their menu and nutritional information if you ask for it. My favorites are The Wellness drink, Turkey Burger protein style with tofu fries, the BBQ chicken flatbread, and the tuna salad lettuce cups. The staff is knowledgable and friendly  which I really appreciate. I can't think of one thing to critique this place is great and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had the Green Smoothie and it was so delicious! They allowed us to call ahead to place the order (they take a long time to make your order normally). We arrived, paid and left with our drinks. Clean place, everyone is friendly and educated on what you order. I have also had the build your own meal and that is very good. I had Tuna -steak with Quinoa and broccoli it came with a lemon sauce on the side (there are more options).
I strongly recommend this place to my friends and family. They get so busy sometimes, so if you are in a hurry i advise to call ahead to place your order."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service. Large selection of foods and protein shakes. I did have to return my chicken satay because it tasted like it had been frozen."}
{"text":"My Boy Justin introduce me and I'm  hook!! Amazing clean fuel and taste amazing!!Great house keeping , clean and good customer service."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but you get what you pay for. The food is delicious as well as the smoothies. It was my first time eating here and I am a fan."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the shit is on point. I spoke with a super cool dude earlier today who asked me a lot of questions. He made me feel very welcome. The place is out of my price range but they fucking nail it for me every time."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and so glad I stopped!  Had the Green Ginger Limeade!  Only 176 calories and it was so good - green grapes, spinach, lime, and agave nectar for the sweetness...it was so refreshing and loved the ginger kick.  It was good but not overpowering.  I read some of the reviews that said the menu was limited.  I didn't think so at all!  They had a lot of options... and the best part is they serve breakfast all day!  I had the scrambled eggwhites and turkey sausage.  I asked them to make it into a wrap so they did.  It was great!  And I ordered a side of the Tofu Fries.  Definitely do the tofu fries... they were so good!!!  I was full, but didn't feel disgusting. It was the perfect meal after my workout!!"}
{"text":"Detest veggie burger I've ever had. Upset my stomach. Overpriced to boot. Will not be back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place! As a health food fanatic they offer a great selection of choices for any diet plan.. whether you are eating for fitness, or you are vegan, or just want a healthier take on some comfort foods they have options for everyone. I've tried most of the items and smoothies and juice blends on the menu and I've never been served anything I didn't love. Great location also next to LVAC and Starbucks so I can get my workout and coffee fix in too.. highly recommend! I live the chocolate veggichino.. it's like a frappaccino but with veggies and fruit it's delicious! Just watch out of specs I'm your teeth after :)"}
{"text":"this is an interesting place i really enjoyed the customer service although they will a little busy to help me i do feel like the business has a fight chance due to the name greens and proteins but the problem is that their line has the potential of being run right out of the door. meaning there is no place to stand if the line gets too big. drinks are way over priced and really are nothing special. i haven't tasted their food yet but i imagine its the same as the smoothies. i am a fan but i don't think the business will last very long if you ask me."}
{"text":"I love this place. The turkey breast is the best! Perfect right after a workout. Portions could stand to be a little bigger but food is clean and amazing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a healthy meal, when I'm too lazy to prep or cook. I always get the Build Your Own meal, which lets you customize your dish to include a protein, veggie, grain and sauce/dressing. I really like how you can choose two veggie items if you're not wanting the carb. The price varies based on which protein you choose, so it's usually between $10-$14 for that meal. The portions are generous, so I don't leave hungry.

When I'm not on a strict diet, I divulge in other menu items, the whole menu is delicious to me! I've heard some items are tasteless, guess I've been lucky :) Today I toted my mother along for brunch, and she enjoyed the Greek Pizza. Instead of tomato sauce they use the roasted pepper hummus, which tasted great with the cheese, cucumbers, and kalamata olives.

The price may be a little more than usual, but the quality in ingredients is worth it. This particular location is my favorite with the decor, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on the west side of town, I hit up this location for my healthy eats. I'd give 4.5 stars for this location, the missing 1/2 star is because I like the decor of the Eastern & 215 location more (lovely little waterfalls and live plants inside).

But have no fear, the Flamingo & 215 location has got what you need for tasty food and great service. My most recent visit was ordering food to go, and the staff knows how to make you feel welcome. Even though they're steady-busy with business, my cashier was polite and engaging. The food runner was just as good, it's nice to be treated well even if you're grabbing food to go. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My favorite healthy kitchen place to eat. Everything on the Menu is 100% good! Especially the turkey Chili!!! Can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"This location is by far my favorite. The people are great and so is the service. The breakfast menu is really good!!"}
{"text":"What amazing service that this greens and proteins provides! The nice girl who rang me up was so cute and friendly! She made me feel like part of the G&P family! She said her name was Kayla. The food was even better than the service and was a great way to refuel after the gym!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing so much about this place from friends who are on strict diets. And was always curious about what kinda food this place had. I pictured raw and bleh tasting food. BOY, was I wrong!

Came here one morning after my roomie and I finished working out. 
Love how bright and sunny it is in there. Like it should be a cafe in LA or an Asian boba spot where there's lime green and yellow furniture everywhere.

I ordered the veggie sandwich as I looooooooooove grilled veggies. It came with a pickle and I ordered the tofu fries as it's side. I like tofu but, after trying it this way and with a spicy aiole, I LOVE TOFU FRIES!

My roomie had the Greek pizza. I love feta but, the kalamata olives were toooo over powering. My roomie had to take them outta his pizza; and he loves olives.

Checking into Yelp gave me a 50 cent off voucher on their shakes or juices so, we decided to get one. I forget which one but, it was delicious. Peanut buttery but, not toooo thick. More like an icee texture.

Already love my salads and veggie snacks but, this place makes them so much more tastier and in a way that I don't normally eat them."}
{"text":"Recall. I once wrote that LVAC had the best smoothies in town. Granted, Greens and Proteins wasn't open at that time. But its smoothies are much, much better (and a few more dollars) than my old favorite. 

Greens and Proteins uses the real estate that LVAC fills with frozen yogurt and replaces it with fresh kale, grapes, almond milk, avocado, chia seeds, flax seed, agave nectar and collard greens. Can you imagine what these ingredients do for your bowels, Yelpers? They do magic. That's what they do. Magic.

The cucumber and lemon infused water washes away any bad feelings I could have had about the price. Other salves related to pricing: $1 check in offer on Yelp; buy 10 smoothies, get one free; the opportunity to earn the Carrot Top badge.

The flavor of the Green Ginger Limeade juice competes (and almost surpasses) the flavor of the smoothies, yet carries only 129 calories. Again, magic. 

As an aside, the bench seat is unusually soft. I could sit there for hours and work on free wi-fi. 

Word to my girls, Blair B. and Jen F., whose reviews attracted me to this lovely spot so close to my--still--favorite gym."}
{"text":"If your looking for something light and clean this is the place to go. Fresh smoothies and salads. Especially the soda fountain has different options than your regular fast food. Very clean store and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always good! Yummy eats... Bison Burgers... I mean, come on ;-) My hubby loves them! I no longer eat red meat, however, If I did... This would be my spot for it... 

I love the broccoli soup, Chicken Salad, hummus platter... not like original hummus, however, still pretty good ;-) 

If you are on the prowl for some healthy, yummy eats... then, this is the place for you!

Besides the fact that they are neighbors to Starbucks ;-)

{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, especially since it is going to be kind of close to our new residence. But I was pretty disappointed (though it wasn't terrible). I got a veggie burger and paid an extra $3 for a gluten free bun, but they bun was dry and crumbly, and I didn't even really get to eat it because of that. The place is not kid friendly, at all- no high chairs or booster seats, or any crayons to keep little ones distracted. The employees were very friendly though, and decent food, even though it is a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner, and I also have come here dozens of times before and am always satisfied. I often order take out, and they are always quick to answer the phone and prepare my order. This is a great place to eat in as well since there are always open tables (inside and outside on the patio), and I do really like their complementary cucumber water for eating in. 

I come here when I am looking for a macro-friendly healthy and delicious meal. I love the Bison Burger, Chicken Sausage Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza, and Chicken Cheese Steak (with lettuce wrap) since these are all filling, healthy (lower calorie), and tasty options. For their sides, I love their tofu fries and their buffalo chicken strips. I also love to get steamed broccoli or asparagus with their reduced balsamic vinaigrette (so yummy!)

For dessert, I'd recommend the granola crusted whole wheat french toast since it's tasty, relatively healthy and not overly sweet. 

Sometimes, the menu can be confusing with macro/calorie counting especially with the different options for wraps/burgers, etc (lettuce wrap, whole wheat bun, etc.) I would also like if they showed the macros for the sides as well such as for the jicama fries, sweet potato fries. I haven't had their smoothies, but watch out since they tend to be on the more caloric side. 

This place is great and a \"go to\" if you are looking for a healthy, guilt-free meal that still hits the spot."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while since I've been looking for healthier alternatives for lunch while I'm out in the area.  I was not disappointed.  The menu boasts a wide range of choices without being overwhelming.  I had the bison burger with the fried tofu and a green ginger limeade to drink.  The bison burger was cooked perfectly; juicy and flavorful.  The fired tofu was excellent--I never thought bean curd could be made to taste so good--I had to remind myself I was actually eating tofu.  And the green ginger limeade was surprisingly tasty--light with a hint of ginger; not too sweet at all.  I will definitely be back to try the ostrich burger and fried jicama."}
{"text":"So far, so good! Excellent service & excellent food. This was my second visit and had an acai bowl for the first time ever, that made me think....why have I never tried this before! It was so yummy! I had the breakfast burrito the last time and that was amazing also."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I was hesitant because it all just seemed too healthy. My friend and I split the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap with sweet potato fries. It was amazing!!!!!  Also the green ginger lime aid is so refreshing and tasty!!"}
{"text":"I had their steak tacos and steak salad. Pretty awesome tasting. The food was take out so I couldn't tell you about customer service but again food was great."}
{"text":"This greens and proteins was probably the best! Steve helped a lot when it came to choosing what I wanted! He was so happy and excited to assist! And that's what is gonna make me come back! Thanks Steve you definitely have me coming back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food and drinks are great. Super healthy and tasty. I ordered through an app and my food was ready a minute after I arrived, fresh and hot. Another time my order was being prepared when I arrived and I had my sleeping daughter in the car, a worker, whom I assumed was on break saw this, went inside and brought out my order to the car so I didn't have to wake my baby! I gave it 4 stars instead of five ONLY because it is very expensive. $45 for my husband and I to eat. 2meals 2smoothies."}
{"text":"Great place, but be prepared to spend a penny. Recommendation is to try the wellness drink most definitely"}
{"text":"Great place to load up on protein or eat clean. It is pricey for the portion you get but their offerings are one of a kind! They offer bison, ostrich, your traditional chicken, and tofu. This is my second time at g&p but my first at this location. Its super hip and it's also a great place for your lunch break or catch up on work. 

I ordered their bison cheese steak on a spinach wrap which is about 600+ calories for $10.99. It also comes with their yummy tofu fries and dipping sauce! The cheese steak is delish and the bison is super lean. Bison is just naturally full in flavor so if you're looking for a good manly meat that's lean but tastes like cow (mmoooo) go bison! I also ordered their white chocolate veggiechino which is 500+ calories for $6.99. I chose the almond milk (you can choose the option of soy or Almond milk) it was pretty delish with grains of grinded up coffee bean. If you're looking for a big caffeine kick I would not bet that the veggiechino will be a good pick me up especially if you're a coffee drinker. But as a sweet milky treat. I think it's a good choice. 

My meal summed up to $20 for myself. It is a bit pricey but if it's just one of those clean eating going out to lunch days I say go for it but I would only drop in occasionally if I'm in the mood. I just think their price does equal the value in portion for me."}
{"text":"I always have the salmon with sides of edamame and asparagus. This is one of the few restaurants in Vegas where you don't feel heavy and bloated when walking out. Their shakes are good too. Service is very, very friendly."}
{"text":"Incredible place!!!  amazing dishes and so healthy for you. Very lean burgers as well and the sides are amazing too! Marc and his staff are very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is my go-to healthy lunch spot in DTLV. I work downtown and we do have a nice variety of restaurants but I was starting to get a little bored of them and wanted a healthier option, with a lot to choose from. Smoothies, juices, breakfast, flat breads, vegetarian options and my favorite, build your own meal. (I get grilled salmon, spaghetti squash and cous cous with spicy peanut sauce). Prices are reasonable, you get what you pay for, so if you want quality food, expect to pay a little bit more. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had the custom meal and tried the chicken, asparagus and quinoa with the pine nut pesto. For all the pesto lovers the sauce was delicious!!! I also tried the watermelon and strawberry cocktail which was also great. Best part is that you can customize based on what you like. All in all great healthy place to try."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the Steak Salad, Ahi tacos with lettuce, and Buffalo Chicken and all were great. My wife had the Berry salad and she loved it (very picky). This will be my go to lunch from now on."}
{"text":"This is our go to when we want a solid healthy and organic meal!! I always do the build your own meal, where you get to pick out your protein, grain, and veggie! The pesto sauce is out of this world!! We LOVE this place! They are also conveniently located by the gyms!"}
{"text":"Greens and Protein is a healthy lifestyle themed cafe that I enjoy. They do a solid job at serving up tasty treats that focus on packing a punch with calories and nutrition. Healthy + Nutritious + Yummy = A happy and fulfilling power lunch. 

Come here if you're...

A) health conscious  
B) trying to stay on track with your lofty dietary goals 
C) want to try a spot that is all about getting Greens & Proteins into your hungry belly.

G&P offers a variety of options to choose from. They offer-- small pickings (appetizers), soups, salads, pizzas, burgers, wraps/sandwiches, 'raw' options, smoothies, and juice. 

Things I've sampled and enjoyed included..... 

Crab and Avocado Lettuce Cups- Bibb Lettuce, Radicchio Cups, Crab and Avocado (they had me at crab and avocado...love at first bite)

Hummus and Pita- Artichoke and Roasted Red Pepper Hummus with Pita bread for dipping (solid appetizer or main meal.. you choose)

Tofu Banana Split Smoothie- Carrots, Banana, Strawberries, Tofu, Peaches, Pecans, Vanilla, Agave Nectar, Almond Milk, Yellow Squash, and Ice (I have them leave the agave out..  you can keep it in if you want to mask the veggie taste..)

Bison Burger- Cheese, Lettuce, tomato and onion w/ tofu fries (This was my co-workers order. He gobbled it down and gave it 2 thumbs up)

Tofu Fries - Tofu sticks that are baked and adorned with a paprika spice that are also served with some sort of dipping sauce (I sampled off my co-workers plate.. yeah, we share like that..)

This place is all about providing you with a nutritionally sound bites that delight. Come here if you're watching the scale or trying to eat clean."}
{"text":"Groupon Alert! $6 for $12 - for this location and their Flamingo location (adding date for relevance: 9/05/15)

I've been here twice to date -- once for a coworker lunch and again on a solo breakfast trip. I'm a fan of their Flamingo location since I'm trying to trim down and eat clean. I like coming here since this spot gives me options to choose from outside of ordering salads. On my last trip, I ordered their Green Ginger Limeade (green grapes, spinach, ginger, lime, and opted out of the addition of Stevia). I make green smoothies at home and haven't thought of this combo. It's naturally sweet and green grapes and ginger tone down the addition of spinach. It's a quick and tasty way to get your fruits and veggies in.  I loved the blend of flavors and strong ginger kick. 

This spot isn't just for smoothies or fresh juices. They offer up a health conscious menu - sandwiches, wraps, pizzas, burgers, salads and more clean eating grub. I've sampled their bison burger and chicken satay in the past and both have  been tasty options. The have a prime Southwest location and may be found within the shopping center (same one as Starbucks, Cracked Egg and Archie's) on the corner of Sunset and S. Rainbow.  I really enjoy having the option of grabbing a nutritious treat around the corner from our office. My coworkers and I have secured this spot as part of our lunch rotation.

{"text":"I come here sometimes after working out at the LVAC on 215 & Eastern. 

I really like their Bison w/ spinach wrap cheesesteak & grilled buffalo chicken strips. If you're not Into eating meat, their grilled veggie wrap is also quite flavorful. The raw jicama fries was my favorite. I also like their tofu fries too. They have really good veggie infused drinks.
 
I really like the clean, modern spacious look of the restaurant. The service is excellent. The guy at the counter was really friendly & was eager to help you decide on what to order. I love restaurants like this. They even have a stamp card for repeat customers. I will definitely be using it."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and although the place is a little pricey, the staff was very friendly and the menus displaying an abundance of scrumptious looking pictures of their many drink and food items.  I also enjoyed looking around at their cute outdoor interior and exterior decor feel with their unique looking glossy lumber block tables. They have a huge variety of food items from vegan options, create your own meal, and  several different ingredients of lettuce, vegetables, herbs, meats offered from dish to dish.  I guess on the down side (not that it's a bad thing) the wide selection of menu options can seem a bit overwhelming.  I ordered the wellness drink with extra pineapples.  The drink was good, however a little on the watery side (maybe from extra pineapple and it being a smoothie and not a fresh squeezed juiced drink).  I also ordered the harvest kale stocked salad which I highly recommend to anyone who likes a lot of flavor and fruit in your salad.  I'm not a big salad person but the staff recommended this particular salad as his personal favorite and I was so glad he did because it did not disappoint!  We also ordered the salmon ceviche which was ok, however in my opinion lacked heat (I like spicier foods) guess I should've added hot sauce.  I love ceviche but probably won't get this again."}
{"text":"After the gym I am starving and in need of some refreshments. Greens and Proteins has a great menu for the healthy bunch of us out there looking for clean food. I leave full but not heavy, and def recommend the bison burger...it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"After years of eating here and loving it, we wont be returning. We order the same thing every time. The last few times the Rough Cut Tomato salad is plain awful. The greek dill dressing makes the dish. They changed it. The last order we got had a strange gelatinous dressing that wreaked of garlic. This time it was a sweet watery dressing that had no oil in it. It was nasty to say the least. The ginger lime aid juice was obviously sweetened with something new. It was sickening sweet. The food has gone down hill. For years it was consistent, healthy and tasty. Now, you never know what you are going to get next."}
{"text":"Trying to eat healthy so came here.

I got the lean beef burger with turkey bacon and a side of jicama sticks. The burger itself was good enough but what I really loved was the turkey bacon. I wonder if I could add avocado to my burger next time. Only two small gripes: 1. The diet soda was out and my jicama didn't taste fresh. Overall I enjoyed the place. It isn't as good as Skinny Fats but it's a good option if you ever need a change."}
{"text":"So here is my personal update: I had a hemorrhagic stroke back in late June / early July. Beginning weeks of August I am back on my feet and walking.

Time for new/ healthier dining options.

Greens and Proteins was just the answer. Quick service.  Just over $30.00 for myself and the wife.  Food was scrumptious. Seems to have a little something for everyone. 

Why 5 stars? Staff seemed to be running on automatic pilot. No one told us or asked us if we were members of the gym close by. Found out after our meal that members get a small discount.

Ah well maybe next time."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to the strip we decided to travel off the strip about 10 minutes west.  Very good selection of foods and drinks; the salad was large and the chicken was juicy.  I also tried the \"green drink\" and this is a good meal replacement complete with fruits and vegetables.  We liked it so much that we went back for breakfast and the multi grain cakes were good but the french toast w/ agavi syrup was excellent and both for $15.00  Lastly don't forget the \"free\" cucumber water.  Can't wait for locations in So Cal."}
{"text":"Been to the G & P on eastern also by the lvac. Came to this one last week to give it a try. The shopping center that its located in is practically dead. the only thing opened next to G & P is a tanning salon and a zabas, everything is closed or empty. 

Upon entering you can see the inside is actually really nice. I think it actually looks better than the one on eastern. The menu is pretty clear and precise. It ranges from green juices, green smoothies and then your food items. All the food items i would say are healthy, you can even get gluten free items or protein style for your burgers if you want.

I ordered from the create your own menu. Basically you pick a protein, 1 side and a grain and your choice of sauce. I picked bison patty for my protein and sauteed spinach, and grilled onions for my sides instead of getting a grain. I also ordered a wellness drink.

The bison patty was cooked as ordered it didn't strike me as anything amazing. It was kind of bland and dry. I'm assuming it was bland because it was healthier. The spinach and the onions tasted exactly as they should nothing special but was expected. The wellness drink was actually my favorite of all the items ordered it tasted really good for all the green vegetables in it. It was actually really sweet so i think they probably put more juice in it to mask the vegetable taste.

Overall place isn't bad but nothing special. One thing I must warn you about is, it is extremely overpriced! Looking at the prices i was surprised they charged so much for vegetables you can buy and make a whole weeks worth for the price the same price. 

Side note: there are also a lot of jacked up guys and girls in yoga pants that stop in because the LVAC is right next to it. So if you want to sit in and people watch it is a good place to do that."}
{"text":"First time trying Green Protein, I've heard all the rave about the place and it definitely meets its reputation.
Fresh is an understatement for the quality of ingredients used. 
It is very busy during the lunch time, got here around 2pm.

I would recommend this place to all my friends who are looking for a health alternative/diet"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and they are the reason I will return. There was an allergy issue and the staff handled it very well. They were kind and kept apologizing but it really was our fault for not reading all of the ingredients closely to see one was an allergen. 

The prices are pretty high but this is a health menu restaurant. The indoor sitting area seemed uncomfortable and multiple two seated tables. The outdoors seating was beautiful and welcoming. It was a beautiful day so that just added to the attraction.

The plates arrived with a large serving of food and the dishes were tasty. It was not a place for a wow factor but great service. I enjoyed the Chicken Quinoa salad and my friend had the Fresh Fruit salad."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins was good, but every time I come here I wait forever.. I really like their Pizzas, turkey burger, smoothies, soups."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey but it's really a great place for some pre or post workout meals and smoothies. Almost everyone who was here was in work out clothes haha. 

I tried the Margherita pizza and the Green Leaf Berry Blast. 

The Margherita pizza was simple but delicious. It was a thin crust pizza with tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella cheese and slices of tomato with bits of basil garnishing. I wish I had gotten the gluten free version though! - I really love how they have the gluten free option. The portion was probably good for sharing with one other person. 

The smoothie was alright. The taste was leaning more towards the spinach and kale which I wasn't really fond of. I do love kale though but it was probably the spinach that was giving it a weird flavor. I'd give it a 3/5. 

There was also complimentary cucumber water which was a refreshing touch. The place itself is pretty spacious and busy but the service was fast and the workers were very nice. I'm glad that this place is close by my neighborhood. I will definitely stop by again to try the other foods. They also have an ostrich burger which I don't think I'll be trying anytime soon lol."}
{"text":"1st time here! Everything is made fresh. I had the Turkey Club sandwich which comes with raw Jicama fries. I did not know what to expect so was surprised the fries were raw. But it was a good surprise! The raw jicama is crunchy and very flavorful with the seasoning they put on it. The sandwich comes on a wheat hoagie and the turkey is from roasted turkey that is seasoned with herbs. Not a fan of the turkey bacon it reminded me of spam and jerky like, but I pulled it out. No big deal. The sandwich comes with butter lettuce, tomatoes and a dressing. You can also get the sandwiches done as a wrap. I will go back and try the chocolate Veggiechino next time! The place is popular choice for healthy eating. Today, There was also a lady set up showing of essential oils in the corner of the dining area."}
{"text":"I love you Greens and Proteins, I just don't know if I can trust you.

Spectacular Food: I saw them make that Apple Pie Shake. I saw what they put into it, and it should not taste as good as it does. There is some witchcraft going on here.

Prices: Not cheap. Especially for strip mall food but lots of quality and fresh ingredients make this a justifiable expense. This is not just a bunch of freeze dried crap from the Sysco truck. 

Here's the thing for this glorious temple of health: we really need detailed nutritional information. Myself and the other regular clients are extremely dietarily concerned. We have Macros and Calorie totals that are a delicate balance, and the nutritional information we get, when we get it, will just be a calorie number. That number is clearly not accurate as often it is attached to an item that can be served seven different ways. They also don't elaborate on side items. We really need detailed counts of carbs, protein and fat and a way to account for how changes in order (extra cheese, different wrap type, etc...) account for changes in nutritional information.

I wouldn't normally complain about this for a restaurant that has two locations but this is crucial for this type of establishment. If this existed I would easily give them five stars."}
{"text":"Yeah! I really liked it! I had just finished a class at Body Heat across the way and I needed sustenance for the rest of my day. Oh a juice bar across the way?! You don't say. I had some kind of green magic in a glass and I loved every sip. 

I couldn't decide on a food order, so I we t with the Greek pizza. Feta on anything and you have me sold. I ate it all, shamelessly, on my way to work in the car. 

I want to try everything on the menu. Also, when Giada di Laurentiis is on television, I will swoon for your establishment. Just an FYI. 

One complaint: it's quite loud and does take longer than I anticipated. But now that I know these two, I will be prepare for next time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 
Excellent service and great food! I had the Margherita pizza with artichoke hearts added, and it was super good and only 310 calories! 
My boyfriend got the bison burger, and it was huge, and the meat was very juicy and cooked to perfection. Neither of us have had bison before, and were pleasantly surprised with how good it was! The tofu fries were different and interesting too! 
The service at this place is really awesome, even though it's the type of restaurant where you order at the counter and then sit down, the employees still come and make sure everything is perfect.
Great place, I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a lighter healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I am coming here after my work out. Delicious , healthy and affordable. Very nice and kind personal. Five star!"}
{"text":"This place has a good variety on their menu. I nearly always order a wellness drink and really like the bison burger - their vegan cheese actually has a good flavor! The build your own bowl with the salmon and sweet potato mash is yummy too!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this location, but the last couple of times I've been here the chicken has been really overcooked and honestly tasted disgusting. Just seems like a waste of money when you're paying for it to be extra with your salad. I would however recommend the wellness drink and their smoothies."}
{"text":"Anyone can make healthy food that tastes nasty.... the whole trick is making it taste appealing.  The Green Smoothie was one of the worst experiences I've had . The lentil soup had everything but lentil in it . Never Again ."}
{"text":"I just ordered from here and unfortunately was pretty disappointed... my boyfriend and I got the tortilla soup, turkey chili, breakfast burrito, the wellness drink, and the loaded antioxidant chiller, all of which were completely bland. The only thing that was decent was the loaded antioxidant chiller. I had to add seasoned salt to the soups to give them even the slightest hint of flavor. I was really disappointed in my wellness drink though because I read it was delicious."}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever! I love this place! I'm on this awful diet and I pretty much can't eat anywhere but this place was approved. I had the turkey burger one time and grilled chicken with peanut sauce the next, and let me tell you. F****** bomb! It was so good and I will be coming back here even when I'm off my diet. I wish we had more places like this place. Healthy, great atmosphere, friendly employees...I could go on and on!"}
{"text":"Hip Hop Hooray!  

Love this place, who doesnt!  How can you not love healthy amazing food!  

Just be award that during the lunch hour you will wait for awhile. They start to get packed around 11:45 until about 1. 

I have been here a few times and each time I have always been very pleased. The salmon is cooked perfectly.  
They offer a lot of different alternatives if you would like to substitute although it can get pricey doing that.  Gluten free bread is $3 extra.....WOW....

I have only had one problem while here and that was a takeout order.  My order was not correct and when I had to drive back to fix it I was not a happy camper.  BUT, the manager was very kind, fixed it for me and also gave me his card saying next time lunch is on him.  I really appreciate the offer and will be using it shortly!"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved the food & service!! I finally tried G&P with a friend. She ordered me the Bison cheese steak in spinach wrap with tofu fries. Not a fan of tofu, but I was trusting her... 
She was so right! The wrap & tofu fries were unbelievably delicious!! And the owner, Patrick even comes around to deliver food to the tables as well check on customers. The whole staff was great! I will definitely be coming back & can't wait for the North location to open!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Went here today when visiting from California for work. I got the protein plate with chicken, sautéed spinach, quinoa, and cilantro pesto as the sauce. I love threat they have specialty, naturally flavored soda and complementary cucumber water! If you are looking for a healthy spot, I definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I've been going to Greens and Proteins for years, but this location is by far my favorite one. Not only is the location clean, the customer service is always on point and the food somehow tastes fresher and more flavorful to me. During my most recent visit I came in around 12:30 with my laptop to get some work done. When I walked in I was immediately greeted with a warm welcome and I noticed there was only two others in the restaurant eating. When I went to order I made it fairly difficult on the cashier, I was looking for something pescatarian that was around 200 calories that was also gluten free. At most places, my needs are generally impossible. This employee (didn't get his name) gave me several options including customizing things on the menu. I ended up ordering their acai smoothie with a few changes. Before I even sat down and got settled... my order was called... it was fantastic. The smoothie was fantastic, the flavor and consistency was just right. I've had so many smoothies where it's too sweet or too healthy and this one was just right! I hung around for awhile sipping my smoothie and getting work done and before I knew it the place was packed! They definitely have a rush from around 12:30-2 for lunch but they seem to get items out fairly quickly. Since I was there longer than an hour I felt the need to order something additional. I decided to go with the ahi tostada but instead of a tortilla they placed it on a bed of lettuce. Let me tell you, if you are a fan of lettuce wraps and ahi, this dish will blow your mind! For a minute I forgot that I was eating at a fast casual restaurant. 

Long story short, if you are looking for a healthy and quick spot to grab food that has options for literally everyone, give Greens and Proteins a try."}
{"text":"Located near LVAC and Starbucks, Greens and Proteins offers a healthy menu with a variety of options for those who prefer healthier eating. 

Inside, mini waterfalls are against the wall with lime green chairs and white tables. It looks pretty clean and well-maintained, except for the dusty fake plants by the booths (yuck!). The young woman at the cash register was a bit unfriendly, but one of the guys behind the counter talked to us while we waited, which made the experience a little better. 

Anyway, our group ordered: the lean angus beef burger, a teriyaki grilled chicken (wheat) wrap and the bison cheese steak (spinach) wrap.

The teriyaki grilled chicken wrap was filled with lean chicken, and definitely had more of a garden-y taste because of the fresh veggies in it. There wasn't a strong teriyaki taste, but it was still pretty good nonetheless. The jicama fries that I ordered with it weren't really that appealing. It was tasteless and watery, so it didn't really make me want to finish them off. I guess I should've just ordered the tofu fries instead. 

The bison cheese steak was the better of the two wraps (or maybe that's just my inner fat kid talking)... but I didn't see how it was healthy because it was dripping with oil. I'm not that disappointed with it because it was still pretty flavorful!

They had complimentary cucumber/lemon infused water, which is really refreshing especially in the summer heat. 

Portions may look small to some, but it was surprisingly filling. You should definitely check it out if you're on the more health conscious side of eating out."}
{"text":"We came here this morning for some smoothies and went for the Chocolate veggiechino and the Green Shake. I was afraid the chocolate smoothie would be too dense and heavy but how wrong I was. It was light, moreish and delicious!! It was actually my partners drink but I tried to claim it for myself. All the flavours were distinguishable and it was a great little caffeine booster after a hard gym class. I also loved the coffee bean/ chocolate bits in there. The green shake was also really tasty, however I thought it'd be more fruity than leafy.
They are quite pricey but competitive when you think about other places and a good size. Plus it's pretty much a meal as it keeps you full for ages and $6-7 for a meal is not bad at all! 
Customer service was great and the ladies were chatty and friendly. Will definitely return for my new favourite smoothie!"}
{"text":"It was my first time, and I was in a rush. I described what I wanted and the cashier, Maria, did a perfect job recommending a really good and healthy drink. 
I'll definitely be coming back to try some of the dishes there. The wraps look tasty."}
{"text":"I went in and didnt get greeted. I staired at the menu and was considering getting a smoothie. And since they have their fruit up at the window none of it was organic. I went to their website and it says \"We make it a focus of the company to purchase the highest quality and natural ingredients possible and eliminate products that contain GMOs and artificial coloring or flavors.\" those apples and bananas were gmos! And the quote is from their website. I drove all the way over to be lied toooooo. Fake healthy food. I left with no goodbye either just blank stares."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Healthy and quick. Good service."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Tried the Bison Burger with Tofu fries; delicious and wasn't gamey."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with friends.  The first time I got the bison burger with tofu fries (I gave the fries to my friend I DID NOT like them at all.) I wish I had gotten the jicama fries instead.  I got one of the cocktail smoothies which tasted good, but not for the price.  The next visit I got some sorta feta cheese salad that was actually really tasty and added some grilled chicken.  Both visits I paid between $17-$18 which just wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on Yelp! reviews and was not let down. It can be tough to find good healthy food and this hit the spot. The guy who helped me was also very friendly and patient with me as my diet is strict so he helped me pick and choose the right stuff. The tofu fried were delicious as was my salad. They also have packets of sriracha so that a +1 star for sure. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Delish! Lots of options, had one of the best vegan breakfasts I can remember. Something for everyone. Affordable."}
{"text":"The juices are insanely good. I got the Wellness and the Antioxidant one today as I'm fighting a cold and my word, they were superb."}
{"text":"I've never ordered food, only juices and smoothies. Just recently tried the Veggiechino - full of proteins and green. Kept me full all day.  Fresh and delicious! Employees are friendly, the place is immaculate."}
{"text":"Awesome pick up service of excellent food. We called in our order and when we showed up the ladies labeled each meal with the name of the person who ordered it. Our customers really loved that. Delivered by www.postmates.com. We deliver from the restaurants you want to your home or office."}
{"text":"Always friendly service there!! Fresh ingredients and good service. Also, they don't make people feel bad when you come in trying to order like 5 mins before they close. Yes, I'm guilty!  I've done it like once lol but I've gone to pick up my food plenty of times and caught other people doing it and they are just as friendly and attentive and even make suggestions. I like that the people that work there actually eat the food their. Hard to take advice for servers that have no idea how anything tastes. I love this location and how late they stay open. Most healthy spots close early."}
{"text":"I had the low carb salad with chicken.  The serving of the small chicken was 6oz which was great.  The dressing tasted fantastic, but there wasn't much of salad in a half order.  The cashier made me think it would have been bigger.  I ended up taking a slice of my bf's buffalo chicken pizza. OMG it was really good - and i'm not saying that just because i'm carb depleted.  The toppings were very good and had a nice sweet tangy zip.  My kids enjoyed cheese pizza and pasta, but i was confused that the kids size pizza was the same size as my boyfriends full size pizza.  I don't get that.  In the end, i really enjoyed dining here.  It would be great to see one of these restaurants open in the N. Phoenix, AZ area where I live!"}
{"text":"I am a healthy eater. Annoyingly healthier eater. Eating out has been know to be frustrating since my husband and I have different tastes and appetite sizes.  

Greens and Proteins is a perfect fit for our family. Good quality ingredients that appeal to both the herbivore and the carnivore and our son who is in the middle. 

My husband has the BBQ chicken pizza and loved it. Plenty of food to fill full without feeling stuffed. I have the veggie sandwich and cleaned my plate. 

Great service. Great food. Comfortable casual dinning experience. This will be a regular lunch spot for us."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas. Great selection of healthy food choices for all three meals. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We come here quite often for their G&P veggie burgers and while this place is pricey, Caesar and the staff are awesome. They ran out of pea protein and he walked next door to grab more in order to make our shakes. SO personable and friendly!"}
{"text":"There is no wow factor to this place. Yes there are many healthy options, but I don't think the presentation, taste, and overall price was worth it. I ordered the wellness drink and chopped salad (total: $20.00). With such simple ingredients, I didn't think they could screw up the taste, but they did. Probably won't return, sorry. 

There are many other options in Las Vegas like SkinnyFats, Grass Roots Juice Bar, and JuiceNGo that have similar options and taste better."}
{"text":"I'm hungrily sitting in my car waiting for my friend and this place came up on yelp. I saw a picture of the bison cheesesteak wrap and decided that I needed it.

Luckily, I was a couple miles away. When I got there, there was a bunch of people outside. I walked into a half empty restaurant. Plenty of places for ya'll to sit! The cashier was okay, not that friendly or memorable. It always enjoy nice service.

Got my food to go and I was stoked. The cheesesteak wrap looked just like the picture, and was pretty huge. But, alas not everything is what you expect it to be. It felt kind of dry. The wrap was definitely lacking. I was a bit disappointed I bothered to take the drive and took the time to get lost -_-
The tofu fries, another let down. I know tofu isn't very flavorful, but these fries looked like they should have tasted better than they did. It had a bunch of red powder, but I guess that was just decoration.

I would forsure want to try something else here though because I feel like I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I found this place after a friend checked in on Yelp. I loved the name and began to read the reviews. A few days later I stopped in to check it out and get the green shake. Mmmm it was so good and I couldn't put my finger on it what it taste like. I just know that I crave one daily. The downside is that it cost $8 dollars for this drink. I came back two days later with a friend and ordered the bison cheesestak wrap with tofu fries. That dish gets five stars. I could not believe I was eating something so sinful tasting but good for me and half the calories of the real thing. My friend had the buffalo chicken strips and they were really good. The next week I went in with another friend and we both tried the summer berry salad...WOW! I went back again this past weekend for the green shake. I cannot get enough of this place. I am going for lunch again today with a new friend. Whenever I find something I love I have to share with everyone. I have one request to the owners, please open up another one next to the Golds Gym on Stephanie. There are lots of open spaces in the center that this very busy gym is located. That way I could go everyday."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. The employees are SO NICE. They provide the nutrition info for all their food. I ordered a new item, the Ahi Protein Salad, and the chef stopped by my table to get feedback on it. Because it was new. LOVE THAT. My previous favorite was the Summer Berry Salad. Now I have a sweet option and a savory option. I feel like the restaurant is run professionally, they clean up tables the moment people get up, the food is yummy and healthy. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken tacos.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu.  Also have free wifi to sit and do work in a quiet environment"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! 

I did not ask the name of the lady at the register but she was very sweet and carried on a light conversation while taking my order, which I always appreciate! 

My antioxidant chiller tasted yummy and is one of my favorite things to get at Greens and Proteins! 

I always stop by here when I'm looking for a healthy snack and will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food , so hard to choose from everything . The smoothies and juices r delicious too . You can't go wrong with that wellness drink ."}
{"text":"A staple for eating out while being loyal to my healthy lifestyle. Thins place makes it easy and takes the work out for a change. I truly appreciate this place and all it has to offer. My entire family enjoys it. Great quality,  great atmosphere, super fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I'm new to the area and was invited by friends and thought why not! The menu has a wide variety including vegan items- I am not vegan but for some reason decided to order from the \"vegan side\" of the menu. The chicken lettuce cups were delicious!! Service was fast, friendly staff and kick ass cucumber water that's freeeeee! The banana split smoothie is the jam by the way. So happy I found a healthy place so close to me! Worth saying again that the staff was really nice and they all had smiles on their faces!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff on top of fresh and clean dine in plus delicious good for you eats. Food is great Only beef is my juice had stems in it a few times I've ordered which isn't the easiest thing when trying to drink from a straw. Surprise haha. None the less I'll keep eating here happily."}
{"text":"Definitely will be back!! 

Vegan,  vegetarian and Raw options Finally!!!! 

We had the Veggie burger with out the bun and tofu fries. 

I am a fan that all calories are posted with each meal or ingredient. 

Locations all around the city."}
{"text":"I've really tried to like this place but I always seem to run into an issue with it. The first time I went it took 45 minutes for me to get my food. I didn't even go in at peak times, I went in well after normal dinner hours. The next time I went the food just wasn't good. I know it can be hard to make healthy food taste good, but those jicama fries are just bad. The burger I had was okay but overpriced for what I got. Yesterday I went to get a smoothie after a workout. I thought they had specific protein smoothies but they don't, which kind of shocks me since they're so close to a gym. I got the veggichino drink and added protein which ended up making the drink come out to like $8...so not worth it. The drink is green and weird and has like chunks of coffee bean in it. And the woman making the drink made too much so she gave me my normal smoothie AND another cup with the rest of the smoothie...normally I'd be ok with that but I'm trying to watch my caloric intake since I started working out so giving me extra really doesn't help lol. I've given them a couple of chances but I really don't feel compelled to go back and try anything else."}
{"text":"Great tasting juice! This location is a little trendy with all the gym people but overall the juice is great and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I gave their other locations 4 stars just because it was filled with annoying gym people but this location is great and has normal people too. Great service super yummy food and juice."}
{"text":"I'm addicted!!! This place is absolutely phenomenal. If you're counting calories or looking for a healthy alternative, you can't go wrong with Greens and Proteins. Their Salads are delicious, the pizzas are amazing, the juices and smoothies are super healthy and tasty, and the Tofu Fries WOW!!! I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I went in really hoping to like this place. I'd really been looking forward to it. Unfortunately, what I ordered was absolutely disgusting and inedible. I got the 7 Vegetable Broccoli Cheese soup. It's blended, has a few small pieces of cabbage on top and pita type crackers. It was chalky and flavorless. I tried several spoonfuls hoping it was an acquired taste. It wasn't. I will most likely try the restaurant at least once more. All of the food can't be that bad. I'll try something others have recommended. I do have to say the service was excellent."}
{"text":"First time at this place and the food is amazing! I had the wellness drink and my husband had the turkey club. So fresh and healthy! Did not disappoint! 

The atmosphere was pleasant and refreshing."}
{"text":"I finished up a doctors appointment in the area and wanted a meal or a snack. Greens and Proteins popped up as having a $1 off juice special, so I stopped by to see what the place was all about.

The place was one of the healthiest \"fast food\" restaurants I've seen, and the prices were pretty damn affordable for what you get. I decided to skip the juice and get a pick your own meal with ahi tuna, sauted kale, and brown rice, with a spicy peanut sauce. It was all delicious and felt really healthily prepared.

Even better, the guy taking my order was super friendly and took my Yelp checkin offer. He ended up getting tipped, so it probably cost me more to use it lol. All in, the meal was around $13-$14 and was well worth it. I hope this place adds more locations, because I'm rarely that far away from the strip."}
{"text":"I come here for all of my smoothies and for breakfast I also order the egg white scramble with turkey sausage and potato medley BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Congress should pass a law making it a requirement for every city in the country to have one of these places .  The food here is of the highest quality and freshness . The chef is often the one who brings your food out to the table and shows great interest in how your experience is going. The staff is super personable which leads to an all around positive experience .  
  Chipotle is going to have to watch out for these folks once this franchise takes root .
  The only things that may need to be tweaked would be:  get rid of the little packets of condiments , as a customer I really hate fooling with them , they are time consuming and messy. There will also come a time when they may want to pare down the number of items on the menu , the number of choices is confusing and time consuming , new comers may find a hard time choosing , there is just too much on there.  Also , they may benefit  from having an array of their juices already made and in the display case for quick sales . It will also add a lot of color in the case and get the product in front of people's eyes to see and should greatly increase sales.  
 The photos of the food that are on the outside of the building and on various places inside give me the feeling that somebody's friend did the photography , the pics have an over exposed / washed out look that reminds me of family run Asian places , they may benefit  from having them redone with deeper , richer colors.   The photos are very important in that they help the customer make a decision without having to read the extensive menu so they should be the best they can be. No expense spared on this! 
  Five Stars for this quality , hands on , caring establishment ."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I believe I expected too much. I ordered the carrot juice without the stevia and it tasted extremely thick. I had to have it blended again and it still wasn't the consistency of juice. I guess I was looking for that juice effect...but didn't get it. I ordered the vegan southwest burrito, which was just ok. Nothing to call home about. With it being so many places in this area with the same concept, im sure to try some of them. It wasn't awful, just not what I expected."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after a night of fun with my girlfriends. Such a delicious healthy alternative to the other delicious but oh so unhealthy typical Las Vegas buffets and foods we had been eating. We had a green smoothie and the wheat pancakes with the turkey sausage and potatoes and OMG, I was in heaven. Everything was so delicious and you can taste the freshness. Customer service was outstanding and the restaurant is so clean and immaculate. I am from Southern California and wish they would open one of these restaurants in our area it was soooooooo good. The manager Marilyn is doing a phenomenal job running this establishment. Thank you for a fantastic experience our last moments in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the spot! The bison burger is super delicious and very juicy, which is not easy to do for bison. Manager is very nice and always great service. Smoothies are good and this is a welcome healthy food option for this area. So many offices in this area and tons of horrible restaurants. I work in the area so it's nice to have somewhere to go for lunch work I have many healthy options. I meet people here for lunch meetings all the time."}
{"text":"I'm a regular and I usually get 2-3 wellness drinks twice per week. They are amazing! I have tried several items on their menu and I've always been extremely satisfied EXCEPT for their bison, (bison burgers, bison wraps). Since I'm so pleased with their soups, pizzas, drinks, .. I decided to try it again. BUT NO. I talked to staff and told them that it was dry, that every time I ordered medium, it came well done. I said, \"a little red please\". BUT NO. I  love the place-so yes, I  gave them 4 chances! ! 

It's still one my favorite places, just not the bison."}
{"text":"So I LOVE the food here but the tall black guy with a goatee who works there is so damn RUDE! We just left there and probably won't be back again because this is the THIRD time we've come in and he has the worst attitude. We spend 140.00 and he got pissy when I asked where the rest of my order was. His EXACT words \"It is obviously on the way if you don't see it in front of you \" Terrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

The food is super tasty, lean and healthy. I love that it shows how many calories are in each food. 

Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"It's great they offer healthy options and they are right next to my gym. They definitely need to work on their customer service skills. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but being located directly next to my gym i frequently visit. 

My recommendation: BBQ chicken pizza. And amazing 320 calories!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place on Groupon and decided to check their menu out online.  I noticed they have bison burger and since I've been dying to try it, I thought this would be a perfect opportunity.   I was not disappointed!  Their bison burger is so juicy, like literally dripping out.  It could use a tad more salt, but other than that I love it.  I've been here several times and this is all I ever get.  The service is fast and always made to order.  It smells great there too. Very clean and fresh.

The location I go to is near my job and they share a parking lot in a business plaza with several other restaurants and a Starbucks.  It can be pretty congested during lunch time, but when you have bison on your mind none of that even matters.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! I stop by here every time I visit town (aka every other week). Simple and healthy and the staff is SO nice. Gloria is super sweet and helpful always! If you're looking for really healthy options - this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for healthy food options that provide a great variety of options. Greens and Proteins have a lot of different nutritious options to choose from. I had the chicken tacos and the watermelon strawberry juice. The food itself wasnt that exciting due to it lacking flavor however the juice was refreshing even though I thought it would be a bit sweeter. Their service was great, and they were patient considering it was my first time eating there. I would try it again, but I'll choose something different next time."}
{"text":"TOFU FRIES!! I like it here. Ok, it is pricey here but it definitely is quality. I normally get one of the many pizza options. I do like the Greek pizza mostly. You have the option to have your pizza crust as low cal lavash, gluten free crust or pita. Also you can have vegan cheese (nope, I will never order vegan cheese). Definitely the favorite menu item is the tofu fries. Crisp and well seasoned. I had the turkey burger with tofu fries last time I was here and it was sheer perfection. The smoothies are yummy and jam packed with nutrients. Also they have wifi which was helpful when I used to have to study. Definitely a good place to go and not feel guilty afterwards and still feel as if you had a filling meal!"}
{"text":"During my bike ride Sunday, I stopped at Greens and Proteins for breakfast.  Who would have thought that healthy food would taste as good as this did?  I was surprised.

The place was almost empty and after ordering my Greek Scramble and coffee, I took a seat at a table under the section near the entrance that has a roof overhead.  The young lady who took my order, gave me a post with a number so she'd know where the food was to be delivered.  She soon brought my coffee which was very hot and enjoyable.

The Greek scramble consisted of scrambled egg whites with feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil, green peppers, onions, and was accompanied by tofu home fries.  Their information lists this at 309 calories.  I wasn't concerned so much about that as I was taste.

The taste was quite good.  The olives brought out the flavor of the feta and the tofu home fries were a treat.  There were some pieces of toasted pita to accompany the scramble.

I will stop in again and try something else.  The price was very reasonable and the patio dining was perfect before the hot days set in.

One note for those who ride a bicycle--few I know--there is a garbage can on the east side of the building and you can lock your bike to that with your cable."}
{"text":"YUMMMY! I got the bison cheese steak wrap and my friend had the California chicken wrap , we split them both ! Quick and fast after the gym. Food was fresh as well. The bison was a little salty but it could of been the chef hehhe !"}
{"text":"I love this place! The portions are great and the food is cooked well! I love the green limeade drink!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time today. The girl at the cash register was not helpful at helping us decide what to order and I actually felt very rushed and u welcomed by her. I purchased a groupon to use toward two breakfast items. I accidentally ordered the banana protein pancakes along with a Greek pizza. The girl got really annoyed when I presented her the groupon and told me it was only valid for two breakfast items, which the Greek pizza was not. She recommended the acai fruit bowl which I had no choice but to accept since I did not want to inconvenience her any further. I'll give this place a 4 star review because  the food was really delicious being that it's a lot healthier than I'm used to and the young waiter who brought out our food made up for the cashiers lack of customer service. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to change your diet but are afraid of trying foods a little out of your comfort zone. They have a variety of items to satisfy your cravings for breakfast lunch or dinner. However, the prices are definitely high enough to scare you away but I think it's worth the visit every now and then."}
{"text":"Perfect menu and setting for my favorite healthy dining spot in Las Vegas! Delicious low calorie options. The pizzas with lavash crust and burgers are my favorites.

Always friendly staff!

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it was fantastic. I have food allergies and eating out is not very easy and can be a pain. They made it simple and we will be back"}
{"text":"Best healthy food on this side of Las Vegas!! The bison wrap & sweet potato fries are awesome! Definitely will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Bison wrap.  The jicama fries are okay; I like mine with a little honey or barbeque sauce."}
{"text":"It took over 30 minutes for my food to be ready and my sweet potato fries were cold.  They also added a tomato that I didn't ask for because I'm allergic.  Quality of service has been dropping off at this location recently.  I can't wait for the nearby Sprouts to open."}
{"text":"This healthy place is located in one of my favorite intersections in Las Vegas, 215 & Eastern!  I came here again after a workout session at the LVAC less than 100 yards away and it was busy as usual.  I'm glad the drink making station is immediately to the left when you walk in because they can make your drink while you wait in line.  I ordered the Wellness again, it's my personal favorite but you can't really go wrong with any of the drinks they have here.  

Protip!:  A Yelp check in on your smart phone gives you $1 off towards a smoothie!  Every bit helps since the prices are high, but if you're a health nut then you'll know eating healthy is costly regardless.

For my protien I wanted the Ostrich but they were out of it this time so I settled for the Bison Burger without cheese.  They're both really good burgers and trying to find real Ostrich or Bison meat is difficult in Las Vegas, much less already prepared and ready to eat.  The tofu fries is really unique and good too!"}
{"text":"This place is really cute.  Bright fresh colors, and bright fresh food.  There are nice gurgling waterfalls cascading down the back walls; however, they are unfortunately masked by the football blaring on the t.v.s?!

Regardless, I had a smoothie.  My smoothie was a whopping $8.00!  I understand the price because it had everything and the kitchen sink blended into it: squash, kale, avocado, berries, almond milk and so on.  You would definitely want to consider these smoothies a meal replacement.  That said, it was extremely tasty.  Just be ready to pay!

Everyone I dined with was pleased with their food.  They said it was flavorful and fresh.  

A good place for a light lunch or a post workout refresher."}
{"text":"I'm pushing it with the 3 Stars, but my husband liked his food so I'll be kind. This is the 2nd time we come here and both times I've been underwhelmed and disappointed with my food. The first time I ordered a grilled chicken teriyaki wrap and the chicken was practically burnt and there was no teriyaki sauce. I had to ask for extra to put it on myself. This time I ordered the summer berry salad with chicken and it was drowning in dressing and had like 5 berries with undercooked chewy chicken. My fountain drink was good though. This place is overrated BIG TIME.!!"}
{"text":"Food was good I love ahi taco yummy and the drink ! Near to the house ! If you are looking for healthy food ! I definitely coming back:)"}
{"text":"Yay for having healthier food options on this side of town!! I loved my steak salad I had today. When the lady told me $15 for my salad I was like ehh.. But my portion was huge! I got to take leftovers home. I think the portions of your meal will equal out to what you pay because the price is a little more expensive.. But you're paying for quality, and the quality is great! Super yummy, I'll be back"}
{"text":"The Frittata is wonderful. Very hearty. Not much I can say about them other then they are very good, tasty and not necessarily for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance so I've been here a few times. Today was the last time. Ah where to start..

Called ahead to pick up. Was on hold for 15 min. Called back and someone answered. Yes, they forgot about me...okay. No biggie. I go pick up (place is empty) and food is not ready yet. Okay. No biggie, I'll wait. I pay, wait 10-15 min. The same person who rings me up finishes ringing up the two other people who arrive then asks me how she can help me. I tell her I already paid and I'm still waiting for my pick up order? She grabs it and gives it to me. Oh...it's been ready the whole time? Awesome. It's cold. 

But what really got me wasn't the horrible service... as I waited for food I noticed the cashier (who says she is new) use gloves to ring people up AND touch food. Why are you wearing gloves? Pretty sure the gloves aren't there to keep her hands clean....pretty sure it's so that the food isn't contaminated! No thanks. I'll spend $12 on chicken somewhere else."}
{"text":"The name of this place alone makes me think wheat grass and vegetarian menus, which for me is a turn off because I am a meat and potatoes type guy.  My wife and eye kept seeing excellent reviews for this place, and the place being advertised all over the place.  Two weeks ago my wife and I were looking for a new place to try, and  she brought up this place.  I thought I would give it a shot, event though I expected it to be a tofu and salad type place.  When we walked into the restaurant I was met with surprise...

This place is not that just a vegetarian place.  They have a rather large menu with a mix of meat, fruits and vegetables.  They have everything from your staple foods such as chicken and beef, to exotic foods like bison and ostrich.  My wife had the bison lettuce burger which was very flavorful. My favorite aspect of this restaurant is the custom meal which allows you to pick from a number of meats ranging from poultry to fish to beef.  The meal also allows you to pick a vegetable, which there are several to choose from, a grain (also several choices), and a sauce of your choice.  I got the chicken with mixed greens, quinoa, and balsamic dressing.  Everything about the meal was excellent.  It was so good that my wife and I have eaten there 4 more times in the past two weeks.  It has become one of our favorite places to eat now.  We have also tried their smoothies with are very good as well.

The decor in this place is very cool, and their are a lot of outlets for electronic devices, which makes this place a great place to study or just go to get work done.  I have also found this a good place for many who go to LVAC to go an hang out and get a good, healthy meal.  I do agree with some of the reviews that this place should have more \"eco friendly\" materials, and the price is somewhat steep for meals.  This will not deter me from going here again."}
{"text":"I've been trying to figure out a factor that I consider when reviewing places and finally remembered: approachable.

I've wanted to try one of these health driven food places and decided on Greens & Proteins and the staff definitely made my visit. They were taking dine in orders when they were closing in 10 minutes. That's awesome. Disclaimer: I wasn't the jerk coming in 10 minutes before closing: I was leaving.

I tried their famous tofu fries with special dipping sauce and a bowl of turkey chili that night.

The first thing that popped in my head was how big the portions were. $5 for 12 tofu fries and $5-$7 for a giant bowl of chili. I took my leftover soup home and it legit filled the take out cup. The chili was the perfect balance of being unique, healthy, and tasty. After I was done I felt fine full but in a pleasant way as the soup wasn't loaded with sodium as most soups tend to be. 

With all that said this fatty felt like this place was approachable. They have a lot of similar items on their menus as other healthy casual dining places in the Vegas valley like wraps, juices, smoothies, and grilled chicken. They also have some stuff that someone who wasn't eating a healthy diet would find appealing.

The prices are affordable, really clean, friendly staff, plenty of seating- I dig it."}
{"text":"I'm tired of these snooty places charging a crap load of $ and can't even splash a smile when ordering or picking up. The smoothie was good but I won't return because I would rather give my money to a place that is welcoming and appreciates it's customers."}
{"text":"Good food ! Great location ! But what's on the menu is starting to look and taste a tad bit boring......"}
{"text":"I want to like this place because they offer vegetarian and vegan options, and I want restaurants to offer more meatless meals.

That said, I recommend Greens and Proteins for the occasional smoothie or pizza.  The smoothies are rich, fresh and made right in front of you.  The pizzas are flavorful and the crust is crispy.

The salads are okay, but I always think \"I could have made this at home.\"  Nothing special there.

The veggie burger is just blah.  Little flavor, strange texture (as others have mentioned), and unpleasantly sticky.  Even with cheese, I didn't find it to have a good taste -- I ended up slathering the veggie burger with mustard.

If you're going for a quick smoothie or a pizza, then Greens and Proteins is a good option.  However, I can't recommend anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally!  A place that serves phenomenal meals without the guilt trip.  

Auditions are coming in close, so Ive been training and eating at home to further reach my goal.  But once a week I'll have a cheat meal and that's where Greens and Proteins comes in to play. 

I've only been here twice, and i have yet steered away from the Ginger Limeade Juice: Green Grapes, Spinach, Ginger, Lime, Agave Nectar, and blended with ice.  Sounds iffy, but trust me it is amazing.  

I tried the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap and the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap on two separate visit and they're both freakin' amazing. I love how the Teriyaki Sauce on their Wrap was not overly too sweet nor thick.  Perfect to my liking without the feeling of going over the edge since I'm sensitive to sugary taste.

The Bison Cheese Steak is probably my favorite Cheese Steak, ever!  The meat was juicy and loaded with big flavor.  Tossed with onions, red peppers, and low fat mozzarella cheese.  This one truly hit the spot and reset all my cravings for the week.

You choose Wheat or Spinach for the wrap, and also Tofu Fries or Spicy Jicama Slices for the sides.  The spice level of the Jicama is just enough to tickle your taste buds.  Great fillers.  Tofu Fries are lightly bread, baked, and served with their Russian Sauce (Low Fat Mayo, Ketchup, and Relish).

Only small gripe is that i wish the portion was just a tad bit smaller.  I have no self control when food is placed in front of me and usually end up finishing it all.   #firstworldproblems.

Service is impeccable and restaurant is super clean and spacious.  I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!

You're a wise man or woman, if you read some of the reviews of Greens and Proteins before trying them out.  You'll find a mix of \"I've experienced better\", \"A-Ok\", and \"As good as it gets\".  The most common issue...the sticker shock.  Yup, Greens and Proteins is on the Richie Rich side for what you get in quantity.  Smoothies over $10 (not lying), sandwiches over $12 (no five-dollar foot long here), and even their burgers are pricey starting around $10 (Where's the beef?).  I read the reviews and was armed with knowledge before I step foot in here. So, why the 5 Stars from me?   It comes to down to what I think Greens and Proteins was trying to accomplish, eating on the healthier side.  One thing about eating healthier, it sure cost more and I knew that coming in.  5 Stars because I expected less and got more.  

I came here for their Proteins, not the Greens, and decided on the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\".  This is a 4 Step process, but I only chose Step 1, which was protein only.   You have a choice of Filet Mignon ($17), Bison ($13), Chicken ($10), Turkey ($9), Salmon ($13), and even my favorite lean meat Ostrich ($17).  I got the salmon and they knocked a few bucks off the price because I didn't get anything else with it.  The salmon is about 6 oz and to be honest, it was a little bland.  I solved this by adding a little Teriyaki sauce to it.  Voila! Problem solved. 

As for the restaurant and ambiance, it's just okay.  You get a mix of your Average Joes, Fitness Freaks, and New Year Resolutioners.  My favorite is the guy wearing a tank top, beanie, and sunglasses.  Guess this guy is just confused whether it's hot ,cold, or sunny inside.  Or, he's just too cool for the rest of us.  The wait is little longer than expected and since the restaurant is also small, it gets a little loud and crowded.

Overall, I am a fan and think Greens and Protein is as good as it gets.  If you're looking for something quick, cheap, and tasty, then Greens and Proteins may not be for you.  If you're looking for something clean, healthier, and don't mind spending a little more, then Greens and Proteins is perfect."}
{"text":"You'll get fresh healthy food, but expect to pay a price for it.

Stopped in for a quick healthy lunch, was greeted with friendly service and paid $35 for two to eat.  The green leaf berry smoothie was good, but the apple pie smoothie tasted watered down.  Next the Margherita Pizza (about 10\" across / enough for 2 people to eat) was just like any other you can get and the Thai Chicken Peanut Satays sounded appealing.  They were supposed to be spicy, but were not at all; they were chicken skewers with some kind of creamy peanut sauce over them.  

Nice atmosphere - guilt free eating - just wish it was more affordable."}
{"text":"Wow...A new location and all reviews are 5 Stars.  Albeit only 3 reviews, this is a new location on the Westside (i.e. the best side, throwing up the W!!).  If you read my review of the Eastern location, I too gave them 5 stars.  However, it's easy to dismiss these posts as biased ones since there is so little reviews.  I had to investigate because that's what I do.   

I am a fan of Greens & Proteins and one complaint about them is price.  Most of the items on the menu are pricey and to be honest, don't have much taste either.  Keep in mind, G&P is healthy and that includes you to have an healthy wallet. I'm not a baller by any means, but will splurge when quality proteins is what my body needs.  I also use to have food delivered to my home via \"Eat to Grow\".  This was pricey too and taste is only for the desirable.  I made my biggest gains on these meals and G&P is no different. 

I've tried their Salmon and Ostrich Burgers in the past.  At this location, I opted to try their Turkey.  You get 8 oz of clean protein and less fat with their Turkey Burger.  This meal is also served with their Jicama fries.  The turkey was pretty good, but the fries is something that made it into the basura with the quickness. After Lent, I will definitely come back for their Filet Mignon.  

I gave the other location 5 stars, but had to drop this location to 4 stars.  This G&P is more spacious, but missing that ambiance that the Eastern location has. Great people watching at the Eastern location.  Because this location is new, the staff is also new.  Knowledge is power and a newbie staff can mean weakness.  When I order at places like this, I like to know how much the servings are like protein count, total ounces, etc.  The staff actually had to go to the back and ask.  They also didn't know if they served fat-free ranch.  I know, I'm just getting picky but these are the things most health driven restaurants would know.  I'm sure by the next visit, they'll be more prepared. Thus, I will probably up their rating back to 5 stars. 

Still a fan of Greens and Protein.  Don't be surprised if you see multiple check in's from me at this joint.  This is a new and more spacious location.  I'm sure within the next couple of months, the word will be out and the ambiance will mimic what the Eastern location provides."}
{"text":"Here's my not so long review on Greens & Protein

I gave up on Greens & Protein about year ago.  I had a back experience at one of the other locations and when this one opened up, I had another bad experience. I'm not going to go in detail to what happened because it's really a moo point (Yes, from Friends).  I gave G&P another try and sure glad I did.  There's a lot of options at G&P and the price is not too shabby.  A huge plus is the macro breakdown and most of their items are on myfitnesspal. 

My favorite is their BBQ Chicken Pizza, which is less than 500 calories and packed with over 30 grams of protein.  Other favorites include their bison and ostrich.  Bottom line, Greens & Protein has become a staple for my post workout needs."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here after finishing my leg workout at LVAC. I usually hit Tropical Smoothie but had been meaning to stop by this place. I needed something to go so I figured I would try one of the smoothies; they all seemed tempting. I settled on the Green Smoothie. I was pleasantly surprised when I took my first taste. I have to say I'll be back and next time try some of the food."}
{"text":"Great healthy meal options and super friendly helpful employees. Everything I ordered (chicken, mushrooms & rice) were super tasty! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered smoothies here after our spin class. We ended up getting the extra protein added into our drink, which racked up the original $7.50 smoothie to $10! Don't get me wrong, the smoothies were pretty good but call me cheap for not wanting to spend that much on a drink I can make at home. I'll probably come back and try their food because it seems to be getting a lot of love lol."}
{"text":"I ate the French toast which contained pecans which isn't mentioned in the online, on-screen (in store), or the paper menu. I had an allergic reaction to the pecans which I would have avoided had I known the allergen information. I didn't bother mentioning anything to employees since we needed to leave to deal with my reaction before it got worse. What kind of food provider doesn't list allergen information? 

Otherwise, the food tasted reasonably ok. We would have perhaps returned as we're trying to create healthier eating habits and also enjoy trying new things. The service was mediocre and the beverage selection was oddly limited. We obviously won't return due to the allergy issue."}
{"text":"This Greens&Proteins at Eastern is really great. Sweet potato fries come out just right - golden and not overdone. Pizza comes out perfect - not burnt.

I had a couple bad experiences at Flamingo/215 with burnt pizza and less than fresh avocado so that is why I am highlighting the fact that the kitchen at Eastern does a better job of food prep!"}
{"text":"This is a great location for Greens&Proteins. Staff is super friendly and the kitchen does a good job of preparing the food just right. I am particularly happy about their efforts to offer vegan menu items. They are also very happy to accomodate substitutions."}
{"text":"I raised my rating to 3 stars because the owner wrote me a thoughtful apology.

That said, I will still avoid this Flamingo/215 Greens&Proteins location because the food quality and the consistency of food preparation is very disappointing. Rainbow/215 and Eastern/215 don't have the same issue. It's too bad because the outdoor patio at Flamingo is the nicest!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! I had ordered a Grilled Vegetable Wrap that came with amazing fresh daikon fries along with a Leafy Green Berry Blast Smoothie and my husband ordered a Vegan Burger along with Delicious Tofu Fries with a Wellness Drink Smoothie.  Everything we had ordered was so tastey.  So we went again the very next day and I had ordered the same thing and my husband ordered the Vegan Pizza and Carrot Juice.  The smoothies are seriously really healthy and so refreshing!  We are not Vegans but wanted to try something different and healthier.  The cafe is set up very nicely with TVs.  The place is next to the gym LVAC where you will see a lot of fit people coming to eat after the gym, also we saw people on their laptops as well.  I give it 4 stars because the prices are pretty expensive."}
{"text":"I'm on the HCG diet & dare not eat out & risk ruining my strict protocol, but I'd heard about this place & the HCG menu, so I had to try it.  It's in a cool area with lots of fitness/health type shops, and it was positively buzzing with the weekday lunch crowd; obviously a fave for the health conscious professionals.  The HCG menu is simple; choose a protein & a veggie, they do the rest.  No measuring or worrying about how to prepare while sticking to the diet plan, they have it all figured out for me.  I ordered mine to go, shrimp & asparagus; it took about 15 minutes, and a guy brought it to my table. I had to take a peek once I made it to the car; wow!  Jumbo shrimp & skinny asparagus, both tender & perfectly cooked, served in a reusable plastic container with a side of dijon mustard.  Delicious!  What a treat to get to have a meal out & know it's structured around my diet; LOVED IT!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and multiple times a month. As a local I stop by Frequently to grab a healthy meal.  The last 3 times I've been underwhelmed with poor service but more importantly very slim potions and improper portions and presentations for their price points.  I'm not sure if management changed but it's not acceptable.  My bill is 12-50 dollars always and now I'll take my elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times it was pretty good. I have had a banana peanut butter smoothie and a bison burger. Wasn't a fan of the tofu fries but hey I tried them :) good place to grab healthy food!"}
{"text":"Love the chocolate peanut butter banana smoothie! I tried the buffalo chicken tenders today and was disappointed with how \"zesty\" it was. I would recommend less citrus as that was the only thing keeping me from enjoying the meal. I loved that it was under 450 calories as well as a nice presentation."}
{"text":"I made my own meal: grilled chicken, spaghetti squash and quinoa. I really liked that you could look at each item on the menu and see how many calories and grams of protein there were. I liked everything, though I could tell I was eating healthy food( bland). But when you are trying to eat clean and feel full. They did a very good job. (11.99$ for my meal)"}
{"text":"This place is very close to where I live but I've never had a good meal here. Meals consisted of a very dry tortilla for my wrap, what was supposed to be a healthy tuna option, the mini ahi tostadas, but they were drenched in a sugary sticky dressing, and a couple other dishes that just weren't good. I mentioned my disappointment to another resident and they said they agreed, but another friend of mine says some stuff on the menu is great you just have to know what to order. I just had several bad meals so I switched to The Goodwich down the street for my nearby lunch fix, which is delicious! The juices and smoothies are good though."}
{"text":"I'm super disappointed with my experience with this business. I placed an online order using this app a few days ago when I visited Vegas. First of all, they called me and told me that the soup I ordered was not available due to a broken blender and politely offered a turkey chili, which seemed fine, until he said it would cost me an additional $2. No thank you, I kindly responded. He offered to deliver the parfaits I ordered and claimed he would give me a credit for the soup, which seemed great. Until I checked my bank account. At first, I figured maybe the double charge was accidentally, until it fully posted to my bank account. I contacted the bank and they claim they are both legitimate charges. So let me break it down for everyone- my first charge (soup included) was 23.58, the second was for 17.62. I literally was charged $41 for two little parfaits."}
{"text":"This is an edit/update since my review last week. It was a head over heals different experience. The food was excellent. The service was wonderful. Thank you for restoring my faith back In this establishment.  I will be back. I will tell friends to go. The roasted red pepper hummas is a new fave! I will be coming back for that. Next time I'm going to try the raw nachos. They sound delightful!!




So. Not. Impressed. For $20 bucks I don't  expect my food to be tossed in a bag and my drink to be forgotten about."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got an average of four stars. I got the egg white omelet with turkey sausage and for the portion size and bland taste, it was definitely not worth ~$8. The only thing I liked was the little orange slice they put on the place. I could make better breakfast at home!

Ok my sister's oatmeal was tasty but it wasn't anything I couldn't recreate myself. 

The girls at the front were super nice but the food was a waste of moolah. If my dinky omelet was $3.99 maybe I wouldn't be so harsh."}
{"text":"Great juices and salads"}
{"text":"Greens & Proteins is a great place to eat.  The food is delicious. Plenty of healthy choices and low calorie meals. You can get anything from a pizza to a smoothie. All the choices are pretty much low cal. The staff is pleasant young and professional. I came during rush hour and they got us in and out. The food was fresh and out fast.  

They are open from 7am to 10pm Monday- Sunday.  There is 4 locations near the 215 beltway. They have great deals on Groupon!"}
{"text":"I remember my first visit at Greens & Protein on Eastern & Pebble and I gotta say it was the worst experience ever. Fortunately for me things have improved and I do realize that each location varies. 

I've been to this particular location twice now on a Saturday and Monday and I'm very pleased so far. I've been ordering their egg white scramble turkey breakfast and a green chia seed smoothie with added protein and I must say that it's pretty darn amazing.

I love eating at a place where I am aware of the ingredients are in my food and where they give a precise calories count of each dish. It definitely makes life easier for me.

I also love that this healthy place doesn't cost an arm and a leg for super delicious and fresh food. This has become my favorite place to eat breakfast and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to eat healthy.

Way to go G&P!!!"}
{"text":"First time here... no one could explain what was in the food?  Asked about veggie burger... no idea what was in it?  Next the guy at register game me no info how to get the food!  Finally figured as there is a number you get when ordering.  Never was told?? 

Ok the Veggie....by far the worst!  Omg...tasteless is the best description!  The owner should taste the food!!!! 

Avoid!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, customer service was outstanding. The bathrooms were super cleans as well. 
Now to the main stuff, we ordered buffalo wrap and tri tip tacos and wellness juice too. 
Buffalo wrap was very delicious and well prepared. The tacos were tasty but a little on the dry side. The sweet potato fires and wellness juice was very good. Once I'm in town I'll definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my juice at all. When I order juice I expected it to be juice. I received my drink and as I was drinking it I noticed something was weird. I asked the guy at the counter what type of juicer they used because I've never had such a Texture before... He informed me that they do not use juicers at all but they blend their juices... Then that is not considered a juice! That is a blended vegetable drink. If I wasn't with my coworkers I would have asked for a full refund because I was not even able to drink it. I am on a strict juice diet and cannot have much fiber and that was definitely not in the description. Plus you would think being a healthy alternative restaurant they would know that blending vegetables ruins the nutrient value. 

You would think when somebody advertises juices that it would be juice not blended and chunky ( gross) 

Waste of my time and money! Ended up skipping lunch that day because I couldn't finish the \"juice\" without gagging and didn't have time to go anywhere else. 

I am giving it a two star because inside was clean, nice, and customer service was great! Everybody who got food there said it was a bit overpriced, which I agree.  

That was definitely the worst juice I have ever had in my life. That was my first time there and definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have yet to review this place. 
We come in on the weekend, and split a breakfast burrito. There are quite a few options for a side dish, which is included with your burrito. 

We have tried the sliced avocado as well as the potato medley. I love both. Fresh salsa is also included with the burrito. The food comes out HOT. Steam coming out. That is what I am talking about! 

I don't know how people can eat this entire thing by themselves. We split it, and we are stuffed. The food is so good, and the staff are really friendly. We also really enjoy their drinks. I love anything that has grapes in it. The drinks are so fresh and full of flavor. 

It is always clean here as well. Love it here."}
{"text":"I very rarely eat out, but when I do I come here. Staff is wonderful... very friendly and accommodating. Chris goes out of his way to remember my name and take care of me and my friend Ashley.
Food is always hot and prepared in a timely manner. 

Thank you to the Greens & Proteins staff for all you do!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and the staff working r so nice and very happy. Its nice to go into a restaurant where everyone is smiling and say hi and when u leave they say bye and have a good day as u r leaving. I like customer service like that, plus as u r sitting there eating the guy that waited on us came over and asked us if we were good and if we needed anything. That amazing service. The best part the food is soooo good and the drinks r tooooooo."}
{"text":"While it can be a little bit pricey it's is one of favorite places for gluten free healthy meals. The BBQ chicken pizza, parfait and ginger limeade are three of my favorites. I do wish they had maybe a few more breakfast options."}
{"text":"This place was packed when I went in. I tired their Bison Cheese Steak with Tofu Fries on the side and wow that was good! Their smoothies are actually pretty good despite what is in it. The menu seems relatively healthy and the interior decoration is very modernized. It really set the mood. I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Knocked off one star for absurd prices. 

However, the quality of their food is absolutely amazing. I can live off the Antioxidant Chiller -- stuff is made of gold. Definitely refreshing after a good work out if you're not into the Wellness Drink, which tastes like grass but I'm sure it's ridiculously good for you. 

And after that hard work out and you want to find some good food under the guise of low calories, get the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I can also eat that stuff for days and maybe they're lying to me and it's not as healthy as it should be, but I can die in happy ignorance. 

Prices: 
Antioxidant Chiller = ~$6
Wellness Drink = ~8 (use the Yelp check-in for $1 off) 
BBQ Chicken Pizza = ~$10"}
{"text":"Ostrich burger and green leaf berry blast Yum!!

Nice to see something healthy and different In the valley.


Out door and indoor seating.

Kinda crowded all the time but that tells you something, GOOD FOOD!! 

Clean and everyone is super friendly."}
{"text":"We ate here twice while in Las Vegas. It's worth the trip off the Strip if you're looking for food not full of butter and salt. (Don't get me wrong, there is some great food on the Strip.) We did lunch here while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive at the airport - Harvest Kale and Chicken Quinoa salads. Both were excellent - and huge - along with two very good smoothies. We did breakfast on day two with the protein pancakes and the roasted vegetable fritatta. Again, excellent on all counts. The only hit is they didn't have coffee (broken machine), but we just jumped on a latte at the Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"I was really impressed. The menu features  delicious healthy options with calorie information. I enjoyed a bison cheesesteak that was only 600 calories. My partner has pizza with hummus as the sauce and feta as the cheese. Cucumbers represented the pepperoni. Very good affordable meal."}
{"text":"My daughter (age 12) and I had dinner at the Eastern/215 Greens and Proteins last night. I had the steak salad and she had oatmeal with fruit. Both dishes were prepared perfectly and tasted great. We also had smoothies, which were also delicious. The staff is very friendly and we got our food very quickly. This is a great place to go if you're wanting a healthy, delicious meal. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I came in today and ordered the green smoothie and the mini ahi tostadas. Both items were delicious.  I always pass this place up to go to the other fast food joints. Never again will I substitute health over wealth. This dishes are simplistic yet complex. Great food and the service was good also. The young lady brought all the smoothies to the customers with a friendly attitude. Don't let others pre judge this place for you. Try it for yourself, look over the menu before you go. They have a couple of dishes that are similar but aren't. Just a large variety of good ole wholesome food. I saw mothers with young children inside    which made me think  what a great start they're giving to their kids. I will be back."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins: The name says it all! 

I make a smoothie daily and regularly visit smoothie and juice bars, but I've never had a smoothie as good as the ones that my husband and I tried here. The consistency was so smooth yet thick like any good smoothie should be. 

There are SO many good options here for anyone. Make sure to get the potato melody as your side! : )"}

The fact that the macros are SO GOOD that I can EASILY fit it in my day even on contest prep is even better!!!! Everything I have had has been AMAZING .. but the fact that they list ALL Macros is what keeps me going back! Thank you for providing this service .. especially for those of us that practice Flexible Dieting! You make dining out easy! Makes me not want to go anywhere else when I want to \"eat out\" :)"}

When I came I had a turkey burger with tofu fries, taste pretty good."}
{"text":"Not just for health freaks people I'm telling you! I'm not a hardcore vegan or health nut but I do pay attention to what's going in my body so I had to give this place a try. I had the steak tacos. Delicious! I don't know what kind of sauce they put on top but it made the tacos!! You got 3 tacos with the choice of corn tortillas or lettuce wrapped. Large portion only really needed to eat 2. I'll definitely be in again and again. Craving one of their delicious fresh smoothies! Also, the establishment itself looks SO clean. That is not something I ever overlook. They do have a pretty large selection in food and drinks as well. Go try it!"}
{"text":"WOW! All I can say is the customer service, and the two young pretty ladies that greeted me, got me sold to come back again! I live on the southwest, and I happened to be around the 215 and Eastern area craving a protein shake. The big sign caught my attention and I was in a thrill. I got the Acai Berry protein mixed with greens, and it was delicious! (recommended by the cashier)

I myself, am a business owner here in town and was impressed with this place. They also have big star DJ resident Steve Aoki a big fan! I heard they have three more locations coming up! Best of luck to this brand and the best of success! 

Yelpers check em' out!!"}
{"text":"I spotted this place while going on a coffee run. I was on a diet at the time as per usual and my foods were pretty limited. I went in just curious to see what they had. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I asked for a wrap but I didn't want the spread that came with  and also no added salt. (Yeah I was that person) the cashier was very nice and made it happen for me. The food was great considering the lack of everything that would normally be yummy. The restaurant was clean and tidy. A definite must for any healthy eater."}
{"text":"I love this place. Love the choices for delicious healthy food.. Especially since it seems like nothing but fast food joints are popping up in this area."}
{"text":"The service is great. The people there have great customer service and are so welcoming. Only problem is every time I eat here I can never keep the food down. This may be a super TMI but I get really bad sh!ts when I eat there and I even had food poisoning. I legit was on the toilet or laying on my stomach for a full 24 hours. I'm pretty sure it's just me but I can't eat here anymore.  **UPDATE** I received a reply back from the owner of this specific greens and protein and I just want to let you know that I've lived a healthy lifestyle for over 10 years now and am currently on prep for a bikini competition so my body is well aware of the types of food that is entering my system.  I'm only eating to fuel my body right now so shouldn't assume that I'm an unhealthy person who is just trying out your certain restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken cheesesteak and jicama fries, got home and I had tofu fries . Not a fan of the fries, but the cheesesteak was great, the season was delicious, and it was very fulfilling."}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was extremely excited about something new and \"healthy\" not too far from my home. Turns out its not as \"Healthy\" as it promotes to be and is a bit over priced for the quality of the food. To me, Health= organic. If its not organic its not healthy. I don't want to eat pesticides and chemicals, it defeats the purpose of the nutritious food. I went in a total of three different times ( in case someone didn't know what they were talking about) and I asked each time if any of their items were organic, the response \"NO.\" How is this a healthy place when the food, including veggies and fruits,  are not organic? And why is it so pricey when you're feeding me pesticides, chemicals, and no \"added\" but already there hormones? No thank You."}
{"text":"Strictly service. I love the food and drinks here! Very tastey and healthy! What I'm not happy with today is service. The counter girl, short tanned brunette has a really bad attitude about her. I felt like I was annoying her by ordering and that I was an inconvenience to her when I was asking her questions trying to figure out which shake I used to love to order. Wednesday morning 10:15 girl, work on your attitude."}
{"text":"So so. The menu lacked lots of green-vegi choices. Name should be various meat and tofu proteins and green drinks. Veggie Garden Burger was just a pale bocaburger (no veggie or garden in it), my wife a life long vegetarian could not eat it."}
{"text":"A quick stop over at Greens and Proteins left my stomach smiling, without feeling the need to rock the elastic sweatpants around the gut afterward.

One highlight of the menu here is the option to build your meal to your specs, starting with your greens, protein, grains, and choice of sauce - All of the components for a full and balanced meal, with you knowing everything that went into it.

For my order, I went with a vegan burger, topped with avocado (costs extra), and a side of tofu fries. The burger was delicious and flavored to perfection. The baked tofu fries were insanely good too. I left the restaurant wishing that more places offered this as a side. Don't fret, carnivores. There are plenty of great meat options for you too.

If you're looking for a casual stop for a bite to eat, without the worry of having to loosen your belt a few notches after. Greens and Proteins is the right place to be. I just wish there were more places like this around the valley for the more health conscious eater."}
{"text":"Waited for ever for my food they got my simple salad wrong the ahi tuna salad was terrible customer service sucks won't be back"}
{"text":"I love this kind of place. Everything is kept clean and the drinks are always prepared fresh. It's easy to eat healthy here. They have great selection for any craving you have. I love the complimentary cucumber citrus water. They lose a star because of their pricing."}
{"text":"Definitely unforgettable !!! I've never had a worse meal, I ordered the \"turkey\" burger and I'm still searching for flavor!"}
{"text":"Meh. I came here entry because I had to be somewhere super early and didn't have anything at home to make breakfast. I had briefly looked over their menu and was interested in trying a juice and the Acai bowl. Once I got there I realized that I was more hungry than I thought so I decided to order their breakfast burrito, the Acai bowl and the watermelon and strawberry juice smoothie. The total was like 18 bucks, damn! Anyway, the juice was fine. The burrito had no flavor whatsoever. They give you a little salsa on the side to spice it up, but even that was not sufficient. Eggs just need butter and salt, and this contained none of that. The acai bowl was good, and I have been back about three times to order it again. Others the that, it really is expensive and not as flavorful as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the first time . I had the Chocolate Veggiechino.  It was delicious. I love that they use all natural ingredients. I would suggest this Cafe to anyone looking for a healthy alternative."}
{"text":"My daughter & I came here after workout and ordered 2 Wellness drinks (green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed & agave) --- so good & refreshing. 

Loaded antioxidant chiller (green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, agave nectar) ordered by my daughter's friends - tastes like grape, delicious, not very sweet which is good. 
Location is convenient. Will come back definitely. Just found out have loyalty cards -- buy 10 smoothies get the 11th free. A dollar off if you check in with yelp. Not a bad deal :)"}
{"text":"Love the veggie burger and tofu fries. Food is amazing and they even give free green water which is all that I drink. The manager Patrick has been super helpful and they recently catered an open house for me. I love this place. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at Greens and Protiens. Food is clean, healthy, flavorful and delicious. The yummy sauces and large portions are what sets it apart. It's definitely my go to spot and I'd choose it over the other healthy resturant's. 

I like the build your own meals, and would sometimes even cut the meals in half if I want smaller meals throughout the day. I've had the Apple Pie and Wellness Smoothie and they're both great! One of my favorites is the tofu fries. They're crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and seasoning and sauce are very tasty. I love the complimentary cucumber water, it's very refreshing and light. They're open early, so I would even pick up my lunch before work. I've ordered in, to go and delivery and the quality is very consistent. Employees are friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. If there is an issues they take care of it right away. I come here at least once a week, if not more. I highly recommend this healthy balanced resturant."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy!! If you are feeling like eating healthy and want someone to make you something scrumptious then Greens & Proteins is the place to visit. I ordered a summer berry salad and it was the bomb!! The crisp spinach topped with their citrus dressing and fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, and mandarin slices) married perfectly with chunks of creamy goat cheese. In fact, I want this same salad right now! 

I've also tried one of their green smoothies, although I didn't realize it was a smoothie when I ordered it. I was expecting and looking forward to a juice, but regardless it was tasty!! The menu boasted a bunch a delicious sounding items. I can't wait to venture here again to sample some more yummy goodness!!"}
{"text":"Was amazed to find such a place on my visit to Vegas. And it was something that everyone I was traveling with liked too. My only complain was that there was only one trash can ( at the back of restaurant. Which for someone to clear their table made it a pain) it was a bit on the pricy side. But heathy is hard to find."}
{"text":"So delicious! I drove past this place a few times after the gym, and finally stopped in today. I had the G&P veggie burger with jicama fries and wow! I scarffed it down quick. Yum :))"}
{"text":"Restaurant was completely empty, and one meal took almost half an hour. Very unfriendly staff with bad customer service. NOT COMING BACK"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service. Waited too long and it wasn't busy? Stood around and watched them talk to their friends.  I wanted to try it because I heard it was good but the flavor was just ok. I guess I expected better by reading all these great reviews. I think people believe that its more healthy by eating here but are you willing to pay for it? Not healthier because they put extra granola on things!!!There are other places that have better service and quality. I will try other places and don't see myself returning. I will get my juice at Wholefoods."}
{"text":"Located in the Southeast corner of Las Vegas, but easily accessible via a short drive on highway 215 from Las Vegas Boulevard, Greens and Proteins offers fresh vegan and vegetarian meal options to the hungry health food masses of Las Vegas.  

Hipsters, the health conscious, aging hippies, Thunder From Down Under and Centerfold types, along with your average Joe lined up for smoothies, vegan pizzas and wraps on our visit.

Situated between, ironically enough, between a candy/bakery store and Starbucks, the counter staff was friendly and personable and all of the items ordered, including a vegan garden burger, hummus with pita, Thai ginger soup and tofu fries were well prepared.

For those ordering smoothie drinks, Greens and Proteins has a frequent visitor punch card."}
{"text":"Slow service. I was in front of the line and made me wait about 7 mins. Love their juices but its a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I looooove the loaded antioxidant chiller juice! It's my absolute faaav one! I also love the get the tofu fries and the summer berry salad with shrimp! Overall, I recommend! & the cashier is such a cutie with big blue eyes (:"}
{"text":"Crazy good. If you got some cravings and your on a diet, this is the place to go. Great for a cheat day/ or some \"greens With proteins\". Smoothies are great. BBQ pizza with pita  and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Great place in the middle of the food desert! Will go again. Being organic is the only thing that would make it better and more plain juice options. This is an interesting use of commercial food and better than 80% of other mainstream eateries."}
{"text":"best smoothie I have ever had, chocolate peanut butterr.... I died."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place. The atmosphere is nice and staff is polite. I ordered the G&P burrito with tofu fries with a watermelon strawberry juice. 1. Wasn't really excited there was stevia added to the drink. I would have thought they'd use agave. I steer clear of stevia being some say it's no better than equal. 2. The burrito sounded amazing but it took a long time to get there and just really didn't have any flavor. It's like the ingredients are there but tasteless. I loaded it up on hot sauce but doubt I'll visit there again. Maybe I ordered wrong I'm not sure but just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"The people behind the counter greeted us immediately when we entered. The food was delicious and made in a timely manner. Gluten friendly food available. You can get your food to go or have a dine in experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the g&p veggie burger on whole wheat with jicama fries. The \"burger\" was a mushy patty of processed aggregate items with no flavor to speak of.  The bun tasted alright, and was a nice consistency. G&P's vegan mayo had a buttery flavor and texture reminiscent of garlic butter which would have been a nice touch had the burger been more flavorful.

The staff was not knowledgeable about the menu, and gave my table the wrong food then gave it to the correct table after we had touched it. A table mixup is absolutely understandable but not taking the food back is problematic. The server only took it from the other table after we flagged her down to alert her. 

This was my first time at this establishment so maybe it was an off order but it's not the kind of experience that will bring me back."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here.  I usually get the chicken Ceasar wrap it's delicious!  I also enjoy the green drink and the acai berry smoothie.  The chicken teriyaki wrap was also good!"}
{"text":"I am waiting for my shake. I ordered it at 7:28 and now its 7:47. I use to like this place but when i had to wait more than 20 mins for a shake and no one in front of me is kind of ridiculous. With no one in front of me, i don't think it take more than 7 mins tops to make my shake. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth, so it will be my last time here.

Great Grub get ready for a great loyal customer.

I just got my shake at 7:52 and its so bland and tasteless. I can only taste grapes and i dont think the banana split has grapes in it.
Btw they never called my name, but instead decided to store it in the fridge. I had to go up there and ask for it"}
{"text":"I've tried going here a few times, because I thought maybe I just didn't like the dish I got, but this is the last time I'll go here (for the food, the juice is good). I got the ahi tuna tostada and my fiancée got the chicken sausage pizza. The tuna was really tough to chew and it was literally on crackers. His pizza was very bland and was also basically on a large cracker."}
{"text":"Well it's healthy...  While healthy food isn't fast, holy crap!  This ain't no quick bite!

GMonkey do:

THAI CHICKEN BOWL- aka chicken breast in peanut sauce over rice.  It'll build a turd. 

GREEN LEAF BERRY SMOOTHIE w/Pea protein- pretty good

\"$21 for that or AYCE Sushi next door - WTF?!\" Monkey grumbled."}
{"text":"If you want to eat healthy and are on the go this place is amazing. And affordable! ! Not to mention everything taste great.

I usually make my own plate, chicken breast, mixed greens,  and the sweet mashed potatoes.  I always feel great afterwards. 

They also have a great breakfast selection as well."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Food is great service is outstanding. The food and portion size is perfect.  Can't go wrong at this place.  Everyone always smiles and seems to care."}
{"text":"Been going to Greens and Proteins for several years now and the food is mostly consistent except in their Western location. I ordered it to go turkey burger and it was undercooked but that was a one-off. They had just opened so I'm sure they've got the Kinks worked out.

My favorites are the bison burger ostrich Burger turkey burger and some of the smoothies with the quinoa and especially the tofu fries with the death.

Also the Cucumber drink which is free is always very refreshing on hot days here in Las Vegas.

The staff is very friendly and the owner a sweetheart if you ever get to meet him"}
{"text":"Today my sister and I tried this plate, it was absolutely amazing. Customer service was great, and so was the food. When stevo, the cashier noticed that we didn't eat all the tofu, he brought us out different options of foods to try without us even asking! And then when we were ready to leave, he rushed over to the door and opened it for us. A1 customer service and food!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE Greens and Proteins!  I am so glad that I was introduced to this wonderful option in Las Vegas.  My go-to is the G & P Chopped Salad - spinach, tomatoes, turkey, artichokes, and so much more!  I know why it is so popular - it is amazing!"}
{"text":"good fresh food.  they lost a star cause i ordered the grilled veggie pizza but they gave me a greek pizza which they told me was the grilled veggie.  (sorry but the feta and olives weren't supposed to be on it then)  but either way it was super tasty so I didn't mind.  Everything seemed really fresh and was quite tasty."}
{"text":"We're so happy to have a delicious and nutritious food choice up north! We've enjoyed the W. Flamingo locations many times...no need for the long drive any longer!!! Same friendly staff and clean restaurant.

We had the bison burger and bbq chicken pizza (pita bread option). Great juicy burger! Ostrich is on the menu, but I'm not sure I can handle that. The pizza sauce had a great kick to it. It had the right balance of toppings. I love that they offer free infused water too.
From past experience, you can't go wrong with the granola French toast! Tofu fries are also a win.

We'll be back soon for smoothies!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy eats, Greens and Proteins is for you.  They have a variety of food to choose from and they are able to accommodate those who have specific diet needs(vegan, vegetarian, etc).  

Today we ordered the Bison cheese steak wrap and ahi protein salad.  Both were great selections.  No complaints here.  However, my \"go to\" dish is the BBQ chicken pizza.  Yummm!  Food is consistently good here.  I love the fact that they serve complimentary cucumber water.  The staff is always pleasant and friendly.  Parking is fairly easy, right front of the establishment.  They share a parking area with Starbucks and The Original Sunrise Cafe."}
{"text":"Ordered the custom meal. The ahi tuna was cooked perfect as well as the quinoa and wakame salad. The smoothie was ok. I was not blown away. I tasted one of my friends tofu fries. They were okay not great. I think they should be cut smaller so they're not mushy inside or use a harder tofu.

Overall a good place for vegans, gluten free, etc."}
{"text":"Love going here especially after a good workout or at lunch. The food is very filling. I would highly recommend he justin wrap and the burger and the green shake is one a fave. The tofu fries comes with the burger and wrap and it is perfect!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Came here with my parents who are not vegan or healthy by any means and they really enjoyed it. Yummy smoothies, tofu fries and other delicious eats. The service was fab too! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but this is the third time I've been to this place and so far I love it! The staff is always so nice and welcoming, they make you feel so comfortable. Their enthusiasm is genuine and they're always so helpful and the food is so good. Great Job guys keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy meal + tasty + affordable, Greens and Proteins, is your place to go! Everything is made fresh. I love this place~!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Have had it to go a few times.  First time eating at restaurant,  and impressed by the accommodating attitude. Real can do people."}
{"text":"Imagine a world were everyone has good skin and are very healthy!  That is what would happen if you ate this everyday.  They have great healthy drinks and quality food.  I saw 3 girls who were nice and firm get food and I realize thats why they still have curves, not lumps.  Can't wait to try something else !"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is ALWAYS really nice and helpful in picking something out. The quality of food is always spectacular, and I simply can't get enough of this place. Way to go guys & thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is a great location, but their food is moderate at best, and a lot of the items are not all that healthy."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a bite to eat after a workout or anytime.  Everything I've had has been yummy.  They are reasonably priced too.  Outdoor seating is nice but they have plenty of indoor seating when it's too hot outside."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito and a piece of the BBQ chicken pizza.  I definitely recommend the BBQ chicken pizza.  Great customer service.  It was busy, but the food was brought out quickly and with a smile."}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas, I found this place while searching for a good healthy place to dine. Let me just say! I loved this place. I have been to other locations as well, but this one I went quite often since it was near my home. My husband and I left Vegas and now we are in Texas, I miss this place so much. I wish we had some where I live now."}
{"text":"If you need honest healthy and watch what you eat, only place to go. Staff is always great and happy to answer questions."}
{"text":"My favorite post work out meal conveniently located by my least favorite place, LVAC. I always get the build your own with either ahi or steak, mushrooms, spinach and pesto. If I feel like doing a carb I'll get the quinoa or sweet potato mash. I love that they have calories and macros listed by all the food items and complimentary cucumber water."}
{"text":"I love Greens and Proteins and if it were not so far away I would live here and never cook again.  They make juices the hide the herbaceous nature of veggies. They have Wifi so you can camp out here and it is a great meeting spot if you are on the Henderson side of town.  I also love their indoor garden."}
{"text":"My favorite place for healthy food after I go to the gym. Everything here is the highest quality. Check out the Greek scramble if you want a great meal for under $7. Would highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Wow !! Fantastic !!  Phone service is outstanding. They are so friendly and helpful and the food is sooooooo yummy  my favorite is the bison cheese wrap with sweet potato fries. They have an amazing selection of really good food that is good for you also. This place is my new Favorite place."}
{"text":"CRAZY ROID RAGE customer was RUDE to me. Owners need to give him the heeve ho!!! I'll explain more later and how the amazing girl Savannah professionally put him in his place. 

First the food: I've never really eaten in this restaurant but my HCG diet told me about their amazing prepared meals they have Which are 10$ and weigh out the 4 ounces of meat with 2 cups of acceptable veggies. So good!!! 

ROID RAGE guy... So there was a crazy roid rage maniac who interrupted me as I was paying for my 4 meals to go... He said, \"ummm.. Scuse me miss.. I'm in a hurry and trying to pay and get out of here. So if you don't mind..\" Then he proceeds to try and cut me...by stepping in front of me... You can tell he worked out but was super Aggro. Angry and very rude. Then he was rude to Savannah... The sweet lady checking us out. He did this AS I was paying... The amazing cashier Savannah stepped in and quickly put him in his place. Then....

HE TRIED to start a FIGHT!:: Then he started to try and start a fight with me and my BF as he was leaving. Saying, \"fuck you\" and motioning for us to go outside to 'fight' him... Let me repeat this interaction above was ALL that happened. It was so bizarre. I said why is he so angry?? Then I asked the cashier and all of the employees said he's rude every day... 

It got me to thinking. Although my BF and I ended up paying close to 70$ before we left.. Maybe more.. (because we ordered food for lunch and dinner tomorrow)... And I will probably eat the majority of my next months meals here... Even if this guy is a customer EVERY day.. He should NOT be allowed to be in here and wreck our experience. His rudeness was all my BF and I spoke about all dinner. I hope the owners read this and although my food and experience with the workers here has been great.. They should rectify this situation by banning this guy because I really am dreading have to run into him again... It's giving me anxiety about coming in.. And if every employee knows him I'm sure if they read this they will know exactly who I am talking about. 

Other than that guy... My experience here is amazing. I've lived in LA forever and they really GET this whole healthy living lifestyle thing. I commend them, LOVE this restaurant and will recommend this to anyone. I now have my BF hooked. I also wish there was a reward program as I've now gotten about 7 HCG meals and will keep coming. Such a great restaurant. Great job GREENS & PROTEINS!!!"}
{"text":"Love their Wellness Drink! I haven't gotten the chance to try their food yet, but it's all about healthy eats and drinks here."}
{"text":"I love this Greens and Proteins! Always quick with the service and great clean food for bodybuilders and non-bodybuilders! I particularly enjoy their employee Kristen's energy! She's fast, will tell you her favorite items on the menu, and is always a pleasure to run in to!"}
{"text":"Because of the nearby LVAC, this place has kinda become the a mecca of yoga pants and \"arms day\" guys. So, if you can put up with the constant influx of that crowd, you're good to eat here. I'm actually shocked what some people are wearing to the gym these days...anyway...

I come here for the smoothies, not the food. I have always found the food here to be really bland and overpriced. The gluten-free bread is terrible. Don't bother freaking out over it. Their tofu fries are AMAZING. I love love love these. They are pretty much the only thing I will order as far as solid food goes. Buffalo sauce is very tasty as well and they have a nice vegan alternative that comes with these if you ask.

I really do love the smoothies. I've been coming here for a few years now, and their smoothies never get old. They are super refreshing, healthy, and I really do think it's a reasonable price compared to Whole Foods (not to mention they taste way better). 

This location does have a nice outside seating area (complete with umbrellas), which I do enjoy in the summer."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother just to have a little snack a while ago. I ordered the chicken strips to have something in my stomach. The chicken was really dry and I did not enjoy it very well. But my brother got this juicy burger (idk the name of it). He also got a side of tofu fries. The tofu fries are DELICIOUS. I crave it so much. It's a must!!! The prices are a reasonable price. It is supposed to be a healthy place so it's going to cost a bit."}
{"text":"Wow! I was in town and wanted a healthy meal. I came here based on the reviews. I was not disappointed. The salmon was super fresh and delicious and the salad was amazing. I ordered the lemon vinaigrette on the side and it was tasty.

Sometimes after a healthy meal I am hungry quick. This meal had enough spice and seasoning to make me feel full longer."}
{"text":"Green and Proteins has great, ridiculously healthy food. For real - I didn't know it was possible to make some of the things they offer in such low calorie ways. I've tried a few different juices and a few different food items, and it's all been great. I'd eat here all the time if it wasn't so expensive (for me, personally). To get a fancy drink and a meal will cost you about $12-15, which is middle-ground pricing around the city, but I consider coming here more of a splurge. The two locations are each far from the heart of Vegas, but it's worth stopping in if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I come here at least 2 times a week because it's inexpensive and near the gym. It's unfortunate that every time I come here the staff is unprofessional and the tables and cleanliness of the store is questionable. I have to walk around to find a clean table that's not sticky and the forks look dirty. Staff has loud discussions about customer complaints against them. I believe management needs to come in and watch this business before you lose 4 regular weekly customers. I enjoy the food not the service or cleanliness"}
{"text":"BUGS!!! Went here the other night... after waiting for a really long time (it wasn't very busy) and we didn't get our whole order, they have some kind of mite infestation going on. I posted a picture of the mite crawling on our table. I noticed it after I ate I just hope there wasn't any in our food, they're really tiny!!! Ahhh ew I won't be back here!!!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food & awesome  Variety! The coffee served was Angry Joe Coffee which will now replace all my coffee, best ever.
Greens & Proteins, clean & great staff... love this place!"}
{"text":"The points are for the effort. Otherwise, bland, overpriced and misleading. They blend their 'juices' and put sweetener in everything. Pretty gross. The 'veggie parm' is just spaghetti squash (instead of noodles), marinara and cheese (vegan available), no veggies at all, for $9. The 'make your own meal' thing is bland and comes with a tiny container of sauce. We gave them a couple tries because they were the only vegetarian place around where we stayed, but next time we'll just drive further or order veggie options from a thai place or something."}
{"text":"Whenever I have to be in Henderson (typically for work reasons), I try to make a stop by Greens and Proteins. Why? Mostly because it is healthy food, and I need to eat better most of the time.

That being said, Greens and Proteins, while expensive, is worth it. I'm not saying I'd be dropping money here every week, but it is a splurge for a quick bite (or just a smoothie). Thus far I have had two of their smoothies, my favorite of the two being the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Shake: Cacao powder, dark chocolate chips, banana, roasted peanut, avocado, kale, spinach, zucchini, flax seed, chia seeds, honey, vanilla, agave nectar. This produces a smooth, yet thick smoothie I really enjoy.

I've also had the Green Leaf Berry Blast: Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple, lemon, carrots, cabbage, spinach, kale, vanilla, agave nectar. Not as good as the Peanut Butter Banana taste-wise, and the texture is much more watery. However, all those berries, and vegetables - you know you are getting a powerful boost of nutrition.

Lastly, food-wise I have had their BBQ chicken pizza. It comes out on a thin crust with low-fat mozzarella, chicken, and red onions. It was recommended to me by the staff and I have to agree with them - it was delicious, crisp, not at all greasy, and delightful to be eating a pizza that isn't AS BAD for me as other pizzas.

Overall, I have no complaints about service or quality of food. The only thing is the big bite it takes out of your pocket book. Be prepared to spend upwards of $15-$20 if you want a meal and drink. For smoothies, the pricing is $7.50. It's not the cheapest, but when you are thinking of you health, isn't it priceless? Ha!"}
{"text":"When I wrote my initial review all I had had here were the smoothies and they were a little sweet for my taste. However, after trying the food this is like hella my new favorite place to eat. 

The service is awesome, the place is always clean, the food is IN. SANE. and really reasonably priced. Honestly this place rocks. Breakfast served all day and the caloric value of each item is stated on the menu. 

For realz, if you are looking for a delicious, healthy, and quick meal at any time of day I definitely recommend this joint."}
{"text":"This place was nice enough, and the staff was really friendly. The food was just ok. I ordered the create your own entrée with veggies and brown rice. I asked if I could have extra veggies instead of tofu for the protein, while they obliged, It didn't seem like enough veggies to really be comparable to having meat or tofu so I had thought maybe they would have put a bit more than they did. I could have easily cooked that at home for around 3 bucks on the high end. So paying 10 dollars for that was not worth it. Giving the third star for customer service as both employees I interacted with were really nice."}
{"text":"Want a healthy lunch but not a boring one? This place is it! And their sweet potato fries are great!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place for their smoothies and healthier food options and would visit them often. The staff was always friendly and their service has always been great but that recently changed. 

Last week I noticed my bank statement had a charge from Greens and protein but I hadn't been there in a month so I checked my statements and also noticed that I had two charges to my card the last time I was there (one was not approved) I called the store to see why I had a total of $27 charged to my card with out my approval and when I told the person who answered the reason why I was calling they asked if I was Diana, apparently I wasn't the only one with this problem. 

The manager \"couldn't get to the phone\" so I went to the store and spoke to him in person. He claims they had a \"glitch\" with their system and promised it wasn't fraud on their behalf and that there was 5 other people with the same problem. He also said he would call me on Monday (i went in on a Friday) once he figured out what went wrong,  a week has gone by and I haven't heard anything from them. I had my bank investigate the charge and they returned my money. 

I no longer trust this restaurant and I would warn anyone who eats here to check their bank accounts."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  They have the best selection of healthy food and I've never been disappointed with my choices; always fresh and prepared daily."}
{"text":"I love this chain. The customer service is amazing. The food is usually great; if I ever have a problem it's fixed immediately with no questions asked. 
Save your macros up and try the burgers with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have places to sit outside the restaurant.   Very casual place.  I ordered the grilled chicken quinoa salad. I love it.  Very filling.  The salad was served in a bed of lettuce leaves.  Bite sized grilled chicken is mixed with quinoa, dried cranberries and green apples to give it a tangy, sweet taste.  The different texture is very appealing to the palate.  The Malibu breeze smoothie is a great complement with this salad.  A blend of green grapes, pineapple, carrots, and oranges."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch meeting with one of the offices that we work a lot with and at first I was very hesitant as I have never heard of this place. What a great choice to go to for the health conscious eater.  I ordered the peanut chicken skewers and the G&P salad. The portions are big, enough for two people.   The staff were really friendly.  Prices very reasonable.  Although it's a bit far from work, I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"We love Greens and Proteins in Las Vegas!  I always start with a Wellness Drink!  It's as good as it gets..  refreshing and delicious!  We love the food and the restaurants are always clean and the service is terrific."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and I'm happy to see healthier options popping up around the Las Vegas Valley. I like coming here when I'm craving for burgers because they have Bison meat which tastes great! I've also had their Philly Cheesesteak as well which is equally delicious. The last time I was here I had their flatbread pizza it was pretty tasty. 

I do love this concept but I wish they would give you a choice of a side salad instead of Jicama strips. I only like Jicama with hot sauce and vinegar. I also wish they would blend their drinks a little better. I ordered a green drink and a peeling or something got stuck in my throat.  It wasn't pleasant but before that the drink was good! I'm sure this was just a freak accident."}
{"text":"I could have a FOFU banana split smoothie everyday. It is soooo good. And you can order online for pickup which is a big plus. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars because I belive the smoothies are expensive."}
{"text":"Wow, this place will make you like food you never thought you could.

I ordered the raw \"Nachos\"  and a Lime and Ginger smoothie.  Both were excellent.

The place is very clean and serene, and for what they are serving, it's perfectly priced.

Highly Recommended!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love G & P, EVERYTHING on the menu is good you can't go wrong. BBQ chicken pizza on lavash is the way to go. It's priced reasonably too. My coworkers and I love it here because we can call in an order to go, it only takes about 10-15 minutes and there's still time to do other things in the lunch hour without rushing and it's a healthy but not over priced meal."}
{"text":"One of the best best healthy restaurants I have eaten at. I ordered the Ahi salad and the ginger soup that both tasted delicious. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I went here on a Sunday evening because the Starbucks next door was packed. My friend and I were just looking for a nice quite place to chat and this place seemed like a good fit... The atmosphere was really casual; it was really calm and inviting, definitely had a trendy coffee shop feel to it. That night it was filled with a lot of young girls in yoga pants and gym shorts... I figured it must be the post-workout spot for the ladies from the LVAC across the lot.

Anyhow... as we came in my friend had ordered a wheat grass drink and we took to a table along the back wall. The seating area was nice, all of the tables were cleared and they had a grape green hue to match the healthy theme of the entire place. What was also nice was the waterfall that ran across the entirety of the back wall. Definitely gave it a calming feel with a modern nature theme... if you can try to picture that.

As we were seated I couldn't help but notice the quality of service the server/cashier was providing. While taking every order he would try to acknowledge the guest by their first name. It definitely gave it a personalized feel. It was nice to see, and I could notice a lot of the guests were regulars... if only they did a better job at greeting us as we entered the place. 

While we were seated I also ended up ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Wrap. The price was a little unreasonable for what I got, I understand it's a healthy choice but for $10.99 I expect to get a little more for the buck. I guess all that extra money went into the plating and presentation, which brings me to the next point. For as good as it looked the flavor was very disappointing. The wrap had no taste at all; the only thing that helped me distinguish the ingredients was their texture. 

Overall for what we came for I would say it definitely met our expectations and didn't disappoint, however the food wasn't so great. The ambiance was 5/5, Service was 4/5, and the Food Quality was 3/5; presentation was great, ingredients seemed fresh and health, but the taste was not there at all. Maybe it was just what I had ordered.

I will most likely not eat here again but if I needed a nice casual meeting spot I would definitely keep this place in mind. Although my experience with the food was not pleasant the intent of the visit was for a casual meeting spot and it definitely delivered on that."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here yesterday after our workout. It was kind of pricey and honestly I didn't like anything that much. I really was just eating because I was hungry as fuck and also I spent a stupid amount of money on a juice so I felt obligated to finish it. I did have a $1 off juice/smoothie coupon for checking in when I got there but $7.50 for a juice is a little insane.
My friend got a veggie tofu wrap thing with tofu fries and we shared that and the smoothie. My other friend got a broccoli cheddar soup. 
The wrap was kind of weird. A lot of veggies (duh) but super bland for me. I had to put some ketchup on it. The fries were alright, super strange but the dipping sauce was delicious. My friend claimed to really enjoy the wrap and faux fries. I was pretty meh about them. 
My Most Expensive Juice Ever was ok. It tasted kind of weird and looked downright nasty. My friend thought it was ok too. But for that much money I was expecting a strawfull of heaven or top shelf scotch at least, not just an \"ok\" drink.
My other friend got one whole piece of broccoli in his soup, that lucky man. He ate really slow and when we left he still had like half a bowl sitting there. He and I were both still hungry as fuck when we left. So that was a bummer.
Also- some guy in line next to me described the menu perfectly: \"can you not decide what you want because everything looks so good, or because nothing stands out to you? I'm the latter.\" That sums it up."}
{"text":"Visiting our LV office from LA and this place is across the street.  So had breakfast and lunch here.  Amazing. Breakfast I had the Green Shake, amazing.  Lunch I had the Bison Cheese Steak Wrap with sweet potato fries and a Watermelon/Strawberry Cocktail.  Every single thing was amazing.  The cheese steak was overstuffed with bison meat, no skimping here.  Delicious.  I would be in trouble if this place was across the street from my home office.  I would eat here every day.  Well done."}
{"text":"Meh....came back again to try an acai bowl. It was $8, which is normal, but I'd say less than 1/3 of it was the acai.....everything else was the filler.....ill just drive the extra 5 minutes and go to protein house next time"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this place. The menu, the speed, the quality are all so very good I would come here daily when im in town if it were solely up to me."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Price, service, quality, taste are all 100% top notch. I'd eat here three times a day if I were a LV resident."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be good, however, they keep coming up short.  I agree with some other comments about the staff.  This place does not have a staff on the A game.  C to D at best.

To have trust and faith in a place, it really needs to start with the person taking the order to hit the right keys and input your order correctly.  It's not rocket science and no one is being rushed, so to get your order wrong is just a sign of incompetence.  

We have been here 3 times now and have had bad experiences.  The first bad experience was the wrong smoothies being made.  The second time, the smoothies were not made properly.  We got close to what we ordered, but the people just seem to be too inexperienced.  

Now the third time, they advertise to be HCG and Vegan friendly, however, the chef and owner are not Vegans, and have not read a Vegan cook book.  Hint, hint, maybe will help becoming more familiar with what you are advertising.  This place is still kind of new, but you should have a clue before you make a claim and advertise that you are friendly to people's needs.

Again, the order was put in wrong at the register which cause the entire experience to go nowhere but down, which is sad.  This place has a LOT OF POTENTIAL, as I said in the beginning and I would love to see this place succeed if the owners and chef have the ability to tighten up their ship and get things right.  With all the holes in their staff, which leads to bad experiences by customers, ships full of holes only go in be direction, down.....as of now, I cannot give this place any more then 2 stars.  We will probably give hem one last chance before we write them off completely, I just hope they stay in business long enough for this to happen."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located at Juhl Promenade.  My absolute favorite is Chicken BBQ pizza.  The team at this location are amazing!! Always smiling :)"}
{"text":"Recently went here for lunch before an afternoon yoga class and was pleasantly surprised. I had heard the food was pricey, which it is a bit more compared to the norm, but the portions are large & the food is delicious. I had the turkey club wrap with tofu fries. The fries were crisp and unique and the wrap was great too. They also offer complimentary cucumber lemon water. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to stay fit, but still eat deliciously."}
{"text":"Had the bison wrap and tofu fries. Pretty cool place and fast service. Wish it had more flavor but it is diet food. lol... I'll definitely stop back again and try another item."}
{"text":"I tried the lettuce crab wraps and the bison cheese steak wrap.  I have to say they were both pretty darn delicious. 

I couldn't imagine a cheese steak wrap, let alone a bison, but once I took a bite...mmmmm was all that I hummed.  I have to say, as a wrap I couldn't even eat everything.  As a matter if fact I saved the other half for dinner.  I could not decide between the tofu fries or the jicama fries so I was able to go half half.  They both were good, but I did favor the tofu fries.  I think I might order that as a side by itself too.

This seems to be a pretty bust place, the whole time we were there, there was always a line. But it moves quick.  The servers, if you dine in, are quick and pleasant when serving and taking away your plates.  

I'm pretty excited that I tried this place out because I'm coming back to try even more things.  I'm going to also try some of those yummy smoothies I kept seeing everyone order.  

Yippie for greens and proteins!"}
{"text":"To those having problems or seeing issues: did you say anything? Did you bring it up? Ask to speak to anyone? Remind the young kid his gloves were on? Don't just come on yelp and rip people apart, it's petty and ridiculous. Just talk to them. Any problem I have had, especially with a Postmates order, they fix right away. They bend over for customers that interact with them. 

That being said, very glad I finally have one close to me. Although I still always go to the original location. I'm glad if I don't have the time to do so, I can still get my fix close by. The ability to ingredient swap as needed for allergies and my auto immune disease is amazing. They're incredibly accommodating. They always make my juice exactly how I need it for chemo. Shout out to you good sirs."}
{"text":"Very impressed!! If you are looking for a satisfying healthy meal or smoothies & juices with great customer service, this is your place!! Even though we arrived about 30 minutes before closing, we were still treated like \"priority\". We were never \"rushed\" and the food was made and served fresh!!! The entire staff was warm and friendly!!!

I love the healthy options available to vegetarians & non-vegetarians. I eat meat so the fact that they offer great tasting burgers in bison and Angus is great!! 
I had the Choco-Banana Smoothie...sinfully delicious without the \"guilt\"!! They add kale, spinach & avocado which \"works\" with the rest of the traditional ingredients (chocolate, banana and peanut butter)

I ordered the Angus burger with avocado and cheddar cheese, which was perfectly cooked & juicy!! The sweet potato fries were good n crispy!!

Steve-o not only treated us to great customer service, but gave my friend and I tasting samples of the acai smoothie, walnut pesto sauce with crackers to dip with and refreshing cucumber water!! 

Greens n Proteins...you won a returning customer & a fan!!! Delicious and nutritious!!"}
{"text":"I love love this place.  One of the best really healthy restaurants I have found.  Their smoothies are amazing and have only ingredients that you can actually pronounce, no funny powders, just real food.  I love the lettuce they use to wrap the wraps and burgers if you opt for no bun.  The bison is super tasty.  This place is the best."}
{"text":"I love this place. Salmon with Steamed asparagus and brown rice with Balsamic reduction, or the veggie burger with a gluten free bun are my go to meals. Molly and Jeremy and the rest of the staff are always very friendly and remember me when I come in. I appreciate that the food is made sincerely and with a mind for the health of their customers. Thank you guys. :)"}
{"text":"Although I've never tried their food, I love their juices and the girls in the morning are always super nice and efficient. They even know me by name now! I would defiantly recommend and would like to try their other options as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple greens & protein locations but this is my favorite! Very friendly staff and the food is well prepared here! Tatiana is very helpful and always has a smile on her face, she is definitely one of the reasons I eat at this locations, Always positive and welcoming! If you come to this location I recommend the bison cheese steak! It is by far my favorite thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious real food.  I have gotten take out here a couple times and the food quality and freshness is high.  The tofu fries and tofu croutons in the salads are amazing.  The Ahi protein salad is very filling and the citrus dressing is so good.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"When in Vegas its a MUST to eat here! Have never been disappointed. Clean, fresh and great food. What more can you ask for. 

OF course I highly recommend the Protein pancakes! Best!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I am definitely a food junkie.  I came here with a preconceived notion that I would have a meal either lacking in flavor or in portion, due to the name of course.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I had the Cajun wrap with Sweet Potato fries and both were outstanding.   I also love the cucumber infused water, very refreshing on a hot summer day.  Nice to see a restaurant can do healthy and happy at the same time!  BTW, I actually visited the location on Eastern and 215 but it is not listed on Yelp."}
{"text":"The fact that this place has vegan options that are clearly marked (most restaurants have vegan options but they may not be obvious on the menu) makes this restaurant above average, but the high prices and odd menu (bison burger? gross!) bring it down a couple notches. 

Try the smoothies, they're great. The vegan pizza is good and the soup is delish! Garden burger is fine. What's really nice though is how the vegan-ness and calorie count are clearly displayed.

PS - Outdoor seating is available. They don't have any high chairs or small kid's portions so it's not particularly kid-friendly."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars for their food, it's delicious.  But I would only give them 1 or 2 stars for service.  I've ordered twice on line and both times the order has not come out right, got a wrap instead of a bun, wrong type of wrap, or missing the avacado which costs extra.  When my husband went to pick up the food I ordered today, the person at the counter said I never made an order when the order was right behind them with my name clearly on it.  They then told him he needed to pay for it again, which he would've done had I not told him I already paid for it before he left.  Get your sh*t together green and proteins!"}
{"text":"I am changing my life style and this place is helping. I use to spend 12-15 dollars a DAY on fast food. Now I'm like why did I ever waste my life on crap, everything at this place is so freaking delicious.  I'm having the ostrich burger and all I can say is WOW! If eating healthy and clean is your way here's the place for you.  It is for me! :)"}
{"text":"Everything tasted fresh and healthy, however, it lacked flavor.   It was very bland.   I don't believe spices or simple salt and pepper would make it unhealthy right?   I had the tacos."}
{"text":"It's a good clean healthy option when you have been bad all weekend in Vegas. I had the egg whites scrambled with turkey sausage. It was very good Shannon had the Greek scramble so loved it. And she dosent even like olives. Caleb had oatmeal big surprise there lol. Kyra had the multigrain protein pancakes. I had a couple of bites and though they were pretty tasty. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Multigrain pancakes are delicious (although I don't use the agave syrup I use organic maple at home lol) and the breakfast burrito is also delicious. Pretty much everything I've tried is great... Except jicama fries  I highly recommend and love this place!!"}
{"text":"To keep things simple shall we...

Pros:
-not crowded
-nice staff
-healthy menu choices that surprisingly taste amazing
-electric outlets everywhere!!
-clean

Cons:
-slow wifi
-kinda have to pay for wifi (no biggie but next door offered fast and free wifi) 
-wifi password wasn't working but I was too lazy to find out the right one. 
-pricey but not a shock since eating healthy serves a price. ** I find this trend odd but oh well**"}
{"text":"Updated review. I was very displeased with my last few orders from GP. But the resolve was so pleasant and the managers were so professional. Thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I stopped in today after a 90 minute bootcamp and grabbed a green smoothie - it was delicious and I love going somewhere where everything on the menu is yummy and good for you!  I will be back over and over again !!!!"}
{"text":"I truly was not a fan of this place, the meals here were simple and unseasoned. I understand that their meals are healthier, but healthy does not mean flavorless.. They look and taste like something that cook at home, and let me tell you I'm not a great cook. I guess if you need gluten free items or if you are vegan this place offers an extended menu. However, you are also going to need to pay a bit more for it! 
I ordered the teriyaki chicken wrap with tofu fries and they were just so chewy! And let me just add that I love tofu, but they really dropped the ball on that one"}
{"text":"Excellent attempt at doing a restaurant that is healthy and yet accessible to everyone."}
{"text":"Bison Cheese Wrap - splurging wihtout feeling guilt and I'm all for it.  Tofu fries are a bit bleh but at least I won't feel guilty chomping down fries.  The place is pretty cool and defintely has a lot of options.  A bit pricey but well worth it.

Quick tip - don't get a Caesar salad, not that special and you can get that at quiznos and it would taste the same."}
{"text":"Great place for people with or without eating restrictions. My mother in law has to go Gluten-free, so we try to find locations that accommodate all palates.  This is one of those places! Although I try to eat healthful, I don't really deny myself good food. This places allows you to eat well and flavorful. You don't feel like you are giving anything up. I had the bison burger with Swiss cheese and jicama fries.

I'm also not a fan of green drinks. But I had a taste of the wellness drink and it was really good. 

So give this place a chance, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places. Both the smoothies and juices are great and while at first glance prices look crazy expensive, you get your money's worth not only in deliciousness and quality but also in portion size. They give you a lot of food. 

So far my favorite dish was a make-your-own bowl with turkey, steamed spinach, and sweet potato mash. Absolutely awesome. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I will say that they do what they do well. However, I'm not a health nut, so this review is from the perspective of a guy that has never stepped inside of a Whole Foods.

The atmosphere is bright and inviting. It just looks healthy. Almost like a Jamba Juice, but in restaurant form. The menus are clear and displayed nicely above the registers on a few flat screens.

I ordered the bison cheese steak on a wheat wrap. It comes with a side of tofu fries or jicama fries. I went with the tofu. The wrap wasn't bad. It tasted like a ground beef wrap. The tofu fries were surprisingly good. However, I'm a tofu fan, so take that with a grain of salt. My coworker on the other hand hates the tofu fries.  I wish there was an option to order something unhealthy here. Just because I want a healthy entree doesn't necessarily mean I want a healthy side too. I should be able to get artery clogging potato french fries with my healthy ostrich burger. I shouldn't be limited to an all or nothing healthy meal.

My coworkers love this place, so inevitably I'll be here again. I would never come here on my own though. I don't like paying a premium for anything, even if it is organic and healthy. On the bright side, the female eye candy was solid."}
{"text":"Love the wellness drink, so good for you and so delicious!!! Nice friendly staff too."}
{"text":"BS +++

Hold the presses! If you are bench pressing HOLD IT UP! If you are ironing clothes PRESS IT DOWN! Then grab your car keys and come to this spot.  Vegans Vegetarians Vegettas and meatheads this is the spot for any healthy person or wanna be healthy like myself.  The place is clean and has a nice layout.  The chef (I think he's Samoan) is BEAST!! This kid is like 6 ft something and kills it on the skillet.  The girl who took my order is super chill and super smiley.  The food was WHAT! Seriously it's healthy and clean eating.  I won't write about it because it's like a spoiler alert in The Walking Dead (Carl does die BTW!) hahahaha kidding!  Come down to this spot.  They have breakfast - lunch - and burgers! And shakes and smoothies.  What more can you ask for? They use fresh produce and clean meat.

Food I got:
Protein wrap (breakfast)
Egg White omelet 
Coffee (black)


Food is BOMB
Selection was ON POINT and NOT TOO OVERWHELMING
Restrooms are CLEAN and got COOL RUSTIC LIGHTS
Tables FANCY and RUSTIC
Table wait time PLACE WAS EMPTY
Take out wait time is QUICK
Customer service is GREAT
Ambiance FANCY
Kitchen SUPER CLEAN
Chef is super chill and big (so don't piss him off)

* Boomsauce scale.
BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended.
BS = it's just O.K. (experience)
BS+ = Yo! I like this place.
BS++= That's Whoa! This place good.
BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"I love love love their menu and food quality! Also very clean.  If I were to make ANY change I'd tone down the music & maybe make the music a bit mellower. 

So nice to have so many options of great food!   Today I split 2 entrees w/ a friend & we tried chix sausage pizza on lavish, a bison burger w/ jicama fries (fries served cold - yummy!). EVERYTHING was excellent!"}
{"text":"The workers are always energetic and welcoming! It's really a different environment when people actually like being there. 

I always order the bbq chicken pizza since I feel less... Guilty. LOL it says it's healthy so it must be, right? But honestly, their bbq chicken pizza is amazing!! I've also tried their chicken quinoa salad or something like that & that was also really good! 

The cucumber water is also a nice touch! Very refreshing!"}
{"text":"After just 4 visits here I've walked away thinking it's way overpriced for what you get. I also share Cayenne E's thought that the food itself was bland. I am not a fan of their jicama fries, I ended up tossing them in the trash. A simple California Grilled Chicken sandwich was one of the most boring things I think I've ever had since I moved to Las Vegas. It was flat out flavorless. The only thing that is saving Greens and Proteins from a 1 star review is their Acai Berry Smoothie and the Green Shake which I would actually go back for. But even their drinks seem to be way overpriced for what you get...and yes I'm aware that it's not cheap to source the stuff that goes into the drinks. 

Add in service that was painfully slow along with a not very friendly attitude and I don't see myself gracing their doors again for a long time. Also parking is a pain as the Starbucks next door draws a lot of traffic so the idea of fighting for a space just to get bland food and an overpriced smoothie is not appealing. 2 Stars...but that's only because I'm being nice and want to save 1 Star reviews for places that truly deserve it."}
{"text":"To be perfectly fair... All I eat are greens and proteins! So for me this place is like coming home to a perfectly prepared meal. I was blown away by the low calorie options, by the huge selection and by how great everything tastes. If you can tolerate the pretentious yoga pant wearers and the obviously into fitness body builders then this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Sooo good I could just go here everyday if it were one in Hollywood...please open one or more in LA. This is so good and healthy."}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy place to hit after the gym? This is it!

Although it's in the Henderson area, I try to swing by every so often. 
Their wellness drink is amazing. It reminds me of the Naked juice- Green Machine (It looks disgusting but it tastes so good!).

Food wise, their thai peanut chicken satay is good for a small snack. 
Their BBQ chicken pizza is delicious as well. 

Honestly, I would've never thought eating pizza and burgers would be so healthy!"}
{"text":"This is going to sound strange but this place was TOO - GOOD.  I had the salad with seared ahi and wOW.. It was great. I was looking for something healthy and nothing too heavy- this did the job.  I also had a watermelon drink and that was also seriously tasty.  The portions for both are hefty and I left feeling so stuffed.  And overwhelmed with how high the quality of food was.  they have so many nutritious options to choose from and all their drinks seem super appealing. This is the kind of place that you can go to for breakfast, lunch, dinner & dessert.  It's an all around great little joint if you're feeling like you can go for some greens and a more wholesome range of foods.  

Service was quick.  Received my food pretty fast and I was able to devour it that much quicker.  Everyone working there seemed pretty nice too.  

The price of the food here is reasonable because you're paying for some good quality food.. So of course, it's going to be priced a bit higher than other fast food places.  But really- it's worth it."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins is healthy, fast, and a great place for lunch. The entire shopping center is quickly becoming the go to spot for food on Eastern."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Greens and Proteins a lot, at this location and the one on West Flamingo.  The food is good and the people seem to always be nice.  My complaint is that when you submit an order on their app and you go to pick it up, it's never ready and sometimes not even started.  Then they tell you it will be ready soon.  So you sit in the dining area and wait...and wait...and wait and then you go to the counter to get your food that's been sitting there for who knows how long.  They don't call out your name or come and find you in the dining area.  This has happened to me or my wife several times but only at the Rainbow location.  We use the app to save time and make it easier but this location seems to not value our time.  We'll go to the other locations until this one figures it out."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my first visit, but the food was still just as great during my second visit. I like the healthy eating options, the large menu, and simplicity. 

Turkey Club ($9.99): Sliced turkey, turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and Russian dressing on a whole wheat hoagie. Added sweet potato fries for $1.50. Decent sandwich, however, not a lot of flavor. I added some S+P and condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise) and it improved significantly. Sweet potato fries were good.

Bison Burger ($10.99): Grilled Bison burger, vegan cheese, and LTO on a whole wheat bun. Side of tofu fries. I believe they use Daiya vegan cheese, which I loooove! Plus, it's available at no extra charge! Again, very little flavor as you need to add your own condiments and seasoning, but you can do it to your liking. This was delicious! The patty was tender and cooked just the way I wanted (medium rare). Plus, the tofu fries are awesome! 

Extra Lean Certified Angus Beef Burger ($9.99): This is also grilled and accompanied by LTO. I added avocado and chose lettuce bibb for a low-carb option. Another great burger!

The best part of their menu are all the choices and options. I was delighted that they have a vegan cheese option for burgers at no additional cost. The burgers, sandwiches, and wraps can be paired with whole wheat buns/hoagies/wraps, spinach wraps, and protein-style options like Bibb lettuce or cooked cabbage. Everything is so customizable and they have so many options to fit several diet needs. There is also a build-your-own-meal section."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The menu is overwhelming at first as there's a ton of options but so far I've been here about four times and the food and service has been excellent each time. 

The grilled asparagus is great, the teriyaki chicken wrap is phenomenal (and healthy) and my wife has had the soup, lavosh and other options and she's loved them. 

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Everything made to order.  Using the best products.  But be prepared to pay for it.  This place is not cheap.  What price do you put on your health?"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food....This was my first time eating bison and I must say it was yummy...I'm now in search of a eatery in my area that serves bison. Everything was delicious and healthy which is extremely important to me as a physique competitor. I will check this place out again when I return to Vegas for a visit,"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I've been twice and will definitely be back.  Everything is super fresh and healthy.  The Chocolate Avocado Peanut Butter Banana Shake was killer! I admit I was a bit afraid after reading all the ingredients.  I didn't think it was taste so damn good.

This is definitely a place to try and convert the non-healthy eaters as long as they're brave.  I've also had the turkey burger.  Nothing flashy, but good taste, juicy and fresh bread.  Just the knowledge that all the ingredients are free of all the garbage of any other turkey burger I'd get elsewhere makes you feel so much better about the meal."}
{"text":"Super good. Feel good food.

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza. I was so hungry I couldn't snap a pic in time. In fact, I had to eat the pizza before my guest could even sit down to start eating his pizza. 

The place is legit, the workers are friendly, and the food is fresh. A+ five stars from me."}
{"text":"Fantastic!

We had accidentally came across this place I caught a quick glimpse as we were driving to the gym and immediately decided to go here after our work out for lunch after looking at the menu and seeing bison and ostrich! 

I had the ostrich burger and my boyfriend had the bison burger each with a side of jicama fries. It was so good we didn't even talk during our meal! We were totally glued and hypnotized by our meal!

The cucumber lemon water is delicious and fresh. 

My boyfriend had the straight to the heart juice (lowest calorie option) and boy was the probably one of the best unique juices I have tried in a long time!

This place is so good and healthy they aren't afraid to publish any of their calories from the meals to juices to even the sauces. This is extremely helpful for us as we count calories and are very strict with our intake. 

We will be back and are looking forward to trying different things on the menu (however it'll be hard to stray away from the straight to the heart juice)

The management and employees are excellent. The place is clean and has a very nice feel for it. It's quiet and bright. Great for a quick lunch by yourself, business lunch, date with your significant other, even a dinner! Highly recommend!!

See you soon!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place
I am always battling my weight, and this place does it all for me, breakfast lunch dinner

It's not only for health nuts and dieters, the food is really good. 
It's insane they make tofu and kale taste good

It's an ok location, centrally
But parking is a b**** in the afternoon

I get the wellness shake every time
All your fruits and veg are in there

They do steak, bison, cod, salmon and stuff for proteins
I wish they had Sea bass
I'd be there 14 times a week

Some people think it's expensive 
Yeah kind of, but it's worth it. Because I like to see cooks preparing my food, I like the calorie count on display. 

Staff is friendly, the tables and floors and utensils are always clean, and the bathroom is never gross. 


I love this place
I wish there were more. 
I wish they were open 24/7 cause of the gym and Starbucks and tanning salon is, that's the only bad thing.


*****Update:
My neighbor in Lake Las Vegas is a world renowned Chef and restauranteur with two 3 Star Michelin Awards. Very well known with cookbooks and his products are sold in Williams Sonoma.

I took him here for a quick wellness shake, he enjoyed it. 
Recently, I brought him in for a quick bite, and the restaurant was about 5% full. 

He ordered a pizza or flatbread, and I asked him to try my multigrain pancakes. 
He said no. 
I urged him repeatedly. 
He finally tried it and said \"my God ... Are you kidding me??? Agave nectar instead of syrup?\"
 
It exceeded his expectations. And looked around the place, he said \"this is a good thing going on in here\"

One bite turned into half my plate.  
He asked who the owner of the restaurant was, but I didn't see him. He likes to introduce himself when we are out and he is impressed. 

Those pancakes made a great impression on a French Gourmet chef. 
I urge a side of the if you come in the morning...

I haven't had anything I didn't like. 
But also haven't tried the whole menu, being a creature of habit. 

Spa water is available for free, they even carry the quest bars, and sometimes the Man Bake peanut butter cookies. 

I have to diet or I will look like a meat ball. 
But when I eat here, it's not bland diet food. So I actually enjoy it, and I love meeting other people who like this place too. 

They have I think 3 now, I've only visited 2."}
{"text":"Loved my veggie wrapped in Napa cabbage! Got takeout from here once, rice and veggie bowls, though, and there were NO condiments, so everything was pretty darned bland. I come to places like this to steal ideas for my home cooking."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food is always good....but today my husband waited 35 minutes for an order of buffalo strips and a BBQ chicken pizza. The people who came in 15 minutes after him got their food which was an order of buffalo strips, a bbq chicken pizza AND steak tacos! So we are guessing they gave them our food by mistake and forgot about our order. We both work in the industry so we understand sometimes people mess up and things happen but the staff did not even voice this screw up to my husband, instead they let him wait and when he finally asked why it was taking so long, they quickly made our food. It's a shame because we love greens & proteins but after this we won't be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"I love Greens and Proteins (especially the one on Eastern) and was pretty excited when I got back into town and discovering that this location in downtown has finally opened. 

Okay, I'm just going to get down right to it... here's my review They need to be consistent on how they make their food. I ordered build your own plate - chicken, steamed broccoli, and basmati rice. They served uncooked rice?  And the broccoli was not steamed at all? Hmmm... something must be off the night I came in. Regardless, if I was the manager, or the person expediting the food, I will make sure the food is made right. Uncooked rice? Not okay. And then the server asked me, should we make you another one? No, sir, I've got somewhere to go.

I should have demanded my money back."}
{"text":"Simple food that is prepared well!  Very different eating out experience.  Great for a nice healthy meal after the gym."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and I'm glad that I did. I had the Bison Burger cooked medium rare with cheddar cheese wrapped in cabbage instead of a bun. Well, the beef was cooked perfectly and had great flavor but my complaint is with the Cabbage. Bib lettuce is typically what restaurants use for that crispness and clean bite. The cabbage was well...flavorless and hard to eat. Every bite I had to pull and strands from the ribs of the Cabbage would get stuck in my teeth as well as not being able to be bitten off cleanly. The cabbage made an otherwise great breadless burger kinda ick.

The sweet potato fries were awesome and tasty.

I will definitely come back to this location but I may need to bring my own lettuce to eat with it since the Cabbage has got to go."}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town.  I had heard about Greens and Proteins from friends.  I was very impressed with the decor, the staff was helpful and knowledgeable, and most importantly the food was fantastic.  I ordered a sample of items.  

I started with a green mixture called the Wellness Drink.  Considering the host of healthy ingredients, I was impressed how great the drink tasted.

The Thai Chicken Satay was cooked perfectly.  The peanut sauce an excellent compliment.  These skewers rivaled the best Thai restaurants!

My wife had the Teriyaki Chicken wrap.  The tofu fries are a must have.

I plan to go by for another sample tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is amazing my wellness is always on point and food is always great, sadly last night I had a terrible experience.
So I come to greens and proteins every morning mon-fri before work I always get the wellness drink and George has got me hooked on the berry parfait and the Turkey sausage with egg whites I usually get both and have the parfait for lunch.
My bad experience came Tuesday evening my siblings came to town from Arizona so I wanted to treat them to a good healthy dinner so i took them to greens and proteins, there was two girls there the taller of the two who I have never seen before was extremely extremely rude towards us my brother asked a question and she just rolled her eyes at him and walked away, then 5 min later I ask her if I can help myself to a few cups for water her response was \" I GUESS YOU CAN\" MY jaw dropped I could not believe it never ever have they treated me like that at greens and proteins I wanted to say something to the other girl who by the way looked like she was working by herself since she was doing everything that's the only reason why I didn't bother her. I don't know what was worse the rude girl or the guy  cursing up a storm. 
Anyway I still went in today and I got my usual, great thing is the rude girl from last night wasn't there!! George and the other girl were there, I guess I should just come in during the day and stay away during dinner time.."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, ordering was confusing but then again I think it became confusing because the person at the counter could have cared less that a was waiting to order and a gentleman went directly to order and she helped him before me. Granted I guess I was in the wrong spot but directing customers to avoid unnecessary  delays would be helpful. Other than that, the club wrap I had was very delicious and the sweet potatoes are very yummy! Once I ordered, pick up time was fast."}
{"text":"Might just be me but this location seems to consistently be better than the Flamingo one. The simple difference in just the tofu fries and the way things are cooked seems better. The WIFI is better too lol. The staff especially the managers are always above and beyond."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and clean, however is way overpriced for the portion size of protein you get. You are basically paying $15 for a bowl of lettuce - very small portion of both ahi tuna and steak. Soups are good, but again overpriced for what they are. Their juices are a bit more reasonable considering money for value, and all the ones I've had are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"\"I really want a rooty tooty fresh and fruity... But I'll settle for this delicious healthy Greek scramble!"}
{"text":"SO FAR for what we had this place was good, we had the pancakes and ceaser salad witl grilled chicken. The smoothies were not what we were used to because we lile them a bit thicker butbthey were flavorful still, it is pricey. The staff was very friendly and fast and the place was very clean. We will come bavk and try other stuff but this place gets some very low reviews so we will see next time for ourselves how it will be for stuff lile the Bison burger and wraps and stuff."}
{"text":"The owners reached out to me within hours of my previous post.
Mr. Haggerty took the time to meet me at a location convenient to me & explained how he is using my incident as a training tool.
I'm very impressed with the response and appreciate the passion he puts into this business.
It's good food and I'm glad I get to continue to enjoy healthy food away from home.
Try the bison... lean, mean and delicious."}
{"text":"My first time visiting and it was a hit for me. I enjoy a healthy meal and decided this will be nice since I live on the same block. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos. It was fresh and tasty. I was somewhat apprehensive about trying the shakes and juices, but was offered a sample of the wellness drink. Yummy!!! I'm now a fan. If I had more room in my tummy I'd order more but, theres always time for tomorrow. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins was the 1st health food quick service restaurant I noticed in the area. The food and smoothies are delicious and the employees are patient and helpful. It takes a minute to receive your order but that's because they are making it fresh for you. Now that I can order ahead, the experience is seamless and I'm happy every time. Thanks G&P!"}
{"text":"Such a healthy place to eat. Your food is fresh they make it right after you order it. Great an environment."}
{"text":"Healthy food that's close by and conveniently made with love! I really like this place, and the owner is a total sweetheart. I remember my first visit, he was so welcoming and offered me samples of some of the delicious juices. Mind you, this isn't a weekly type of place for me to frequent, but when I do, I'm always well taken care of by the staff. The wait might be long, but you have to remember this is NOT FAST FOOD! This is food with your health in mind as they're grilling away in the back! Every time I take a bite into the food, I just take the love and quality in the food. I could have easily spent about an hour getting this same meal prepared, but I rather have the big guys in the back do their thing! I love the turkey burger with the vegan cheese. I'm no vegan but man do I love me some vegan cheese. Go ahead and charge me that $.90 extra baby, I don't mind! I've totally made it a habit now to get either vegan cheese slices or shredded vegan cheese during my grocery trips. 

The sweet potato fries are also very much made with love. The last time I think they were a bit too soggy, but it's probably my fault for ordering to go and getting stuck in 45 min worth of traffic.

I ordered a friend the bison wrap and there were definitely no complaints there. This place knows good food, and always takes care of you. Last time I went with both my kids, my youngest had a really bad ear infection and was so irritable she couldn't even sit still. The cashier was kind enough to let me sit in my car and bring the food out.

I think small things like that, going out of her way to help make mine easier, are the reasons I come back to places. I know I can get the same ingredients and make it at home, but when there are people that genuinely care about what you eat and your visit, it makes you want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot in Las Vegas for a healthy quick bite! I heard about this place from a friend and I have been addicted ever since. 

What I order:
- Turckey Burger plain wrapped in a Lettuce shell. It is amazing, low cal and low carb.
- Tofu fries. They taste like cheese sticks! SOO good. I dont care for the Jicama fries, skip those unless you are on an ultra healthy kick. 
- Cup for water. This is a MUST. They have free cucmber infused water, it tastes wonderful. 
- Juice. The ginger limeade is my favorite! It is under 200 calories and packed with healthy fruits and veggies! i neer imagined I would crave a green juice, but it tastes sooo good! It is the perfect consistancy to drink and stays cold long enough to enjoy it. 

Best part: This place is packed with healthy people all the time! So if you are like me and need some insiping to get your soft butt to the gym, check this place out to eat! There are lots of HOT guys (and girls) to check out. They also have wifi so I can yelp. 

Make sure you check in to get a dollar off a juice/smoothie :)

Only downfall, it is slightly pricy. If you are on a Jr. Bacon Cheese diet, this isnt your place. But remember, spinach, tofu and fruits arent cheap to buy."}
{"text":"The food is great. I will definitely go back again. I got the chop salad, and loved it. My daughter got the buffalo chicken wrap. She liked it, but it was a little too spicy for her."}
{"text":"Come here after reading the Amazing reviews. Food was totally low quality and terrible. I had the quinoa chicken salad. It was pretty much quinoa with a few  pieces of chicken. The dressing was very some kind of Asian flavor, could not make up if the chicken was old or the dressing was bad. Well $11 later I went to eat lunch somewhere else. Would not recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever eaten here is delicious and beautiful. Thank you for the complimentary fruit infused water and recyclable everything. We have been enjoying your vegan gluten free pizza for ever and finally had breakfast today. I ordered the soy and tofu wrap with tofu fries and it was to die for. I love how you spice everything. The portion of the wrap was perfect but it could have used a couple more fries."}
{"text":"Three stars means A-OK, and so far this is my experience with Greens & Proteins.   I do have yet to try any of the food, so when I do get around to doing that, I will update my review.  

I want to give it more stars, because I have really enjoyed both of the drinks I've purchased at this place.   

First time, I had the \"Green Leaf Berry Blast\".   A nice mix of berries and leafy greens.  It came out a sort of purplish-brown color but it really tasted great and filled me up.

The second time, I had the 'Wellness Drink', which is a mixture of green grapes, apples, limes, some other fruits and then a bunch of leafy greens.    The taste was fresh and fantastic, and it really hit the spot after my workout.    So yummy and it has all that good stuff in it.  

Customer service was fine both visits.   My drinks were ready in a snap.   The atmosphere of the place is inviting and comfortable and it works with their health-conscious atmosphere.   I could see myself eating here.

So why 3 stars?   I'm deducting one star because at 8 bucks a pop, well it seems a bit pricey for a cup of juice.  But that doesn't keep me away. 

The other star I am deducting for 2 reasons.   Lack of nutritional info and the use of agave nectar in every drink offering.   I track everything I take in, and I would think a place that serves up healthy food could offer more than a simple calorie count.  How much sugar is in these drinks?    Macros are important to my lifestyle.   I would like to see a more comprehensive breakdown.

And the agave is extra sweetener that is just unnecessary and really not a healthy choice IMO.

I am eager to try some of the food offerings.    I will update or offer up a better review at that time."}
{"text":"REALLY AMAZING food! great for after the gym workouts or anytime really. Their Drinks are tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome! You must have a palate for wholesome foods. This place was great. Had a decent raw food menu as I enjoyed the raw pizza"}
{"text":"This place is great for all types of eaters, they have so many vegan, vegetarian, and meat-eater options! Their smoothies are really good, but I would not recommend taking your kids here. I love the hummus plate and the veggie burger! The tofu fries are really good too! They have cucumber water and it's really tasty! I would tell anyone to try this at least once!"}
{"text":"I am not from the Las Vegas area, but every time I do get in to the area, I make sure to get a meal from Greens and Proteins. I found this out-of-state gem after my first day at EDC. The catch here though is the price. Good, quality, food comes at a premium. If you're not willing to spend money on the best that your body should have, then this is not the place for you.

The restaurants are well maintained, their flavored water is fresh and always hits the spot. I had their BBQ chicken pizza, an Acai bowl, and one of their wellness shakes. Delicious."}
{"text":"I love Greens and Proteins! I love taking my friends to try their amazing food! My personal favorites are the pita and hummus, the jicama and tofu fries, the pizzas, and most recently - Pumpkin Chai Tea Latte. This is such a filling, satisfying drink. The flavor is incredible! My husband, who is a very picky eater, loves the burgers and pizzas. Definitely worth checking out. While I am happy that this place is so popular, it's super busy! I look forward to the west side location to open! Just wish there was another one on my way to work and open at 5:30am!"}
{"text":"I'm SO HAPPY I finally got to try Greens and Proteins after living here for 1.5 years!! This wasn't the best place to come for hangover food but I'm sad I waited so long to try this place out! Really unique menu items and good for a gal that's watching what she eats as everything has the calorie count and I think most menu items are only in the 300 calorie range. Things coming out were pretty fast but I have to come back again to try a green smoothie here! Check in on Yelp and I think you can get $1 off any smoothie."}
{"text":"A bit spendy and worth every penny. Super delicious nutritious food. I'd eat here every meal if I was more wealthy. Friendly, helpful service in a clean well lit venue. This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I'm always thrilled when a new vegan-friendly place opens, and G&P does not disappoint! I got to try out their vegan pizza and some of their smoothies at a yelp event, and loved them all!  The peanut butter chocolate smoothie is crazy rich and sweet and would make a great dessert -- but it's still full of fruits and veggies! How do they do it?  I totally dug the vegan pizza - lavash crust with plenty of Daiya plus roasted peppers, kalamata olives and basil. 

I returned for a wellness shake (green veggies magically blended with ginger and other delicious items) that felt healthy but  tasted like a treat.

For lunch today, I tried the vegan burger with tofu fries.  I love these tofu fries!! They are actually more like vegan chikin fingers? nice-sized slabs of 'fu coated in a light batter, deep-fried and sprinkled w/ paprika.  I added a bit of salt and hot sauce, then they were perfect!  The burger comes on a whole wheat bun, but has no condiments.  They need some Vegenaise up in there, stat.  The burger was quite tasty and I left full and happy for ~$10 including tax and tip.

The juices are a bit pricy (~$7), but not so bad if you use them as a meal replacement.  Also you can check in on the Yelp app for iPhone and get $1 off juices and smoothies!

As a bonus for dine-in guests, they have DELICIOUS water. I'm not crazy! They make a sort of agua fresca with cucumbers and lemons, and it is damn good and so refreshing! Perfect for washing down your healthy items."}
{"text":"Not organic enough, not gluten free enough.  A tiny bit vegan friendly as long as you eat any old vegetables, and most vegans don't. We pay attention. My regular cities where I dining are NYC and LA so by comparison it may have led to me be harsh with only two stars because for vegas this place might be a three or four star but for overall healthy food restaurants coast to coast it is a solid 2 star. My preferred combo of gluten free and vegan was too much for this place. That's normal. So, Conscious eaters need not apply. I was drawn in by the name because it sounded like something on Abbot Kinney - the hippest spot in Venice, CA. It's not truly a healthy food restaurant if you're actually into ACTUAL health food. If you're in transition from Chili's, Subway, TGIF's etc then this is a great stepping stone to Whole Foods or the vegan menu at the Wynn. The young guy behind the counter was not interested in my questions to determine what I could eat that had no eggs and no gluten. The answer \"Not sure\" when I ask if something has eggs or gluten is a bit of a lame response. The answer to what I could eat there was nothing so it didn't really matter anyways after all. My friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza for takeout and devoured it, but since he regularly eats at Jack in the Box and McDonald's taking his word for quality food feedback is hardly realistic. In fact, his diet was so foul we had to cut way back on the hanging out. TMI. Still, people who go here seem to be enjoying it and the smoothie though not organic, that I took one tiny sip of, was pretty good. If you're not crazy picky about what you eat you'll love it and if you're a food snob keep driving."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Wellness Smoothie and the Bison cheesesteak wrap in a spinach tortilla!  The smoothie is cold liquidy and just delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome, my first visit after hitting the gym next door. ordered the banana split smoothie with almond milk DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"Stupidly expensive for what you get. Make sure to be picky on what bun you get because I had no idea the regular one is made of cardboard and asshole juice. The tofu fries were delicious though. :)"}
{"text":"Place was perfect and decently priced. I'm going to go back for sure. I ordered a bison wrap and it took a while but it was made fresh after I ordered it. I liked the wrap because it didn't fall apart as I was eating it. My wife also got a wellness shake and she thought it was great, if you like stuff that tastes like melted lettuce."}
{"text":"My girlfriend pick this place.  I'm allergic to soy, tree nuts and peanuts.  Definitely not the place to go for me.  They're not allergy friendly.  I was told they can't guarantee if there what I order won't have a trace of soy, tree nuts and peanuts.  Yup...."}
{"text":"Was doing the no-carb thing for a while, and was really hungry. Vegetarian co-worker suggested this place. 

Food was edible; I think I ordered the wrong thing. I got the Buffalo Spinach Wrap and was pretty disappointed. It was pretty bland and mushy and all I could really taste was the wrap itself, which is pretty damn disappointing when you were paying for Bison meat. The Jicama fries were nice, but cold; didn't realize they'd be raw. Silly me. I actually didn't finish my meal, and at $14, that was a pricey \"ugh,\". 

One of my other co-workers had a smoothie that looked absolutely wonderful, and another had a little pizza thing that looked lovely. Not a place I would normally choose to go for lunch, and I think my inexperience may have done me wrong here. 

I am pretty generally of the opinion that Vegans, Raw Foodists, and their Health Food Prophets care more about how well their food follows certain rules than how it tastes. 

Greens and Proteins kind of tastes like compromise. Mmmmm...compromise.

Yeah. No. I'll probably be back in the future; the Smoothies look great, and I hope I just ate the wrongest thing. I'll give this place another try in the hopes that something else I order is enjoyable. Otherwise, I just felt like I was paying triple price for grocery store deli food in order to say \"I'm healthy! I eat raw vegan carrots!.\""}
{"text":"Great place to get a high quality protein and carb meal. Highly recommend. Smoothies are amazing too."}
{"text":"I come here regularly for a quick healthy snack, usually order one of the freshly made juices.  The tofu fries are very tasty and amazingly seasoned, however the menu states they are BAKED when they are actually FRIED, they automatically lose two stars for the false advertisement (which I've complained to management several times and STILL haven't changed on their menu).

There are about 5 or 6 different fresh juices on their menu and they do taste good, but they could use a little more variety.  Nearly all of their juices contain grapes and agave nectar.  Their Wellness Drink, which contains spinach and kale, also adds too much pineapple, orange and agave, making this fresh juice overly sweet.

They are located across the LVAC so there are a lot of people coming from the gym seeking a healthy meal.  But don't be fooled!! A lot of their menu IS healthy however things like sauces, cheeses, dough, batter etc. almost defeat the purpose here.  If you're truly seeking wholesome order the plainest rawest things on their menu.

I go to greens & proteins for the convenience and taste, but think there are better similar establishments.  Also a little pricey but have a large menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Imagine you just finished up a great workout and you don't have the energy to cook a good and healthy post workout meal. You panic!! You only have 30-45 min to make that post workout meal count. So you hop in your car and drive all around town in hopes to find a remotely healthy restaurant! 25 mins go by and you still can't find a thing, so you just enter the nearest drive through and order a burger and fries with a diet coke (because you're on a diet)lol . What I'm trying to say is that it can be hard and an inconvenience to eat healthy especially if you don't have the time to cook at home. Now with greens and proteins all that ends! They have a HUGE menu with lots of options! All nutritional facts are listed on everything they offer! Fast service! With a fantastic ambience!! Food is delicious!! And doesn't make you feel groggy after you eat it!! The only issue I see is that it can be a tad bit expensive at times! But other than that I HIGHLY suggest this restaurant to anyone trying to watch their girlish figure!!"}
{"text":"The ginger limeade is my favorite drink. It's perfect in its taste with ginger and lime. I also love the vegan options. A must try is the vegan cheesesteak. It was so good and filling I could only eat 1/2. It is slightly expensive a drink and meal cost about 25 but the taste is worth it."}
{"text":"Food is basic for the cost of it. The pricing is disturbing. $2.00 EACH for extras such as 1/2 c of rice??? 
I ordered a tuna salad to go and it was less than a cup of made salad and probably less than 2oz of tuna within the salad. The rest of the salad consisted of extra large diced vegetables. 
I was very disappointed with the cost and portion size for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and fabulous coffee. We were here in July.  They make everything as it is ordered, so no old food sitting around. They made such a terrific Mocha (with cinnamon and chili) that my dearest ordered a second one.  When we go back to Las Vegas, we will happily go back."}
{"text":"Decor - amazing! It matched the healthy theme of food and was very inviting.

Selection - you won't get bored! They have so many healthy options that look and sound delicious and fresh!

Taste - I had the greens shake (something I could have made at home) but the price was okay for the convenience and it tasted perfect to its name (apples, kale, banana, and other greens).

We also had the bison burger (wow!) juicy! They have crispy and tasty sweet potato fry options and the kids pizza was huge! My kids loved it."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken pizza was great for less than 500 calories!! Husband ordered angus Philly cheesesteak sandwich and jicama fries. He said the sandwich was delicious but not a fan of the fries."}
{"text":"The best place in LV if you are looking for a healthy option! We ate here several times, their angus wrap is superb, I really enjoyed the berry granola and the build your on plate option is really nice! When I asked for some modification in my fritatta they provided it without hesitation. Loved their food and their attitude!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something different and asked around the office if there is anywhere new and where I should go.  A co-worker suggested I try this place out.  I ordered the turkey tacos that I believe were the daily special and WOW was I surprised!  The flavor was so amazing!  There were three decent sized tacos that filled me up and left me not feeling guilty about my lunch choice.  I cannot wait to come back and try many more items from the menu.  So excited to have this option close to the office!"}
{"text":"Really good never been here. Service was great environment chill and the BBQ vegetarian pizza was bomb.com. My husband got the impossible cheesesteak delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"5 Stars and I didn't even eat here... HAHAHA 
Came here Saturday evening because my boyfriend wanted something healthy and yummy.. I've had this place bookmarked forever and wanted to give it a go.. The only thing is I'm doing a detox which means no food so I just went with him to watch him eat and take big whiffs of his food LOL It is located right by LVAC on Flamingo/215 which is the perfect location for it. Everyone eating at G&P looks like either they just worked out, are about to work out or like they love working out.. Very healthy, clean and fresh feel to the place. You order at the counter and someone brings your food out to you. Everything on the menu looks so good and I love how they have the calorie count for everything. 

My man ordered: 
_The build your own protein plate with chicken breast ($9.99,) broccoli, cous cous and bbq sauce- I thought it was going to be a small portion but it was more than enough and it looked delicious~
_Hummus plate ($5.99) - comes with plain hummus and roasted pepper hummus, served with soft pita and crunchy lavosh~
_Green Shake Smoothie ($7.50) - I love how they don't add sugar to their smoothies... This smoothie in particular is over 600 calories though!!! But it is loaded with all the good stuff. I had some sips of this.. It's very rich & creamy and definitely would a great meal replacement! 

My bf said everything was very tasty and he had plenty left over..The prices are actually very reasonable compared to other \"healthy\" places and they cater to vegan, raw, gluten free and HCG diets! The service was great here too! Especially the guy who brought the food out.. Even though the silverware is self-serve by the fountain drinks he offered to go get them for my boyfriend and checked up on us a couple times~ 

I can't wait to actually eat here!!! aghhhhhh"}
{"text":"Acai bowl was great, refreshing, but overpriced. Hummus and pita...confused why it tasted so bland. The texture was all wrong, hummus shouldn't hold the shape of a scoop of ice cream. I didn't taste any of the spices, oil or lemon or anything that makes hummus taste like hummus. I think this is just not hummus, needs to be called something else. Actually tasting it again just now, it's kind of sweet. What is in this stuff? It couldn't be less like hummus."}
{"text":"Ordered food from this place, expecting it to be a good experience. I ordered chicken tacos with corn tortillas. I receive the order and my food is incorrect and the tacos are wrapped in lettuce instead instead of the corn tortilla I asked for. Being that there is an outbreak I would not have requested as the kind being used isn't specified. 


Called the restaurant to simply get my food remade. Did not even ask for a refund and the first thing she says is, \" unfortunately we won't be able to refund the order.\" Which I never asked for! I just wanted the correct food that I paid for. 


She then tells me to contact GrubHub for a refund (though the order was placed correctly and had nothing to do with the driver or Grub Hub ordering service).


I called GrubHub only then to have the rep tell me that they are telling him a different story and that they aren't going to remake my food. The rep offers me a $10 credit which I never asked for. I JUST WANTED THE CORRECT FOOD. 


Will never return back to this place. Like come on it's a $10 item, I never wanted my money back. I just wanted my tacos to be made correctly."}
{"text":"Probably not for everyone but if you're looking for a healthy meal then check this place out! Some of the meals are bland but at least you know you're eating real food with healthy organic ingredients. The drinks are good, some are hit or miss - I recently got the green heart drink and it was way too gingery!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is always my go to meal after a workout. Not a big fan of the tofu fries though."}
{"text":"Service is great. Wait is never long. Food is always great. Staff is always quick and responsive when taking the order.

The only thing that gets me sometimes is the consistency of the drink I always order: Peanut Butter Chocolate Smoothie, no stevia, almond milk. Some days it's too thick. Some days it's looser. Some days it's more chocolate. Some days it's more peanut butter.

Other than that, a great place for when I don't feel like cooking on long,  busy work days."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and tasty.  Service is good.  Place is clean.  I love this place.  Lots of healthy choices."}
{"text":"First visit was a take out order
I had the Angus beef burger 
Cooked just the way I wanted it cooked
Jicama fried were a disappointment was expecting hot and they are cold
Next time the sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"The steak salad was awesome and surprisingly filling. The V9 juice was disappointingly bland-so bad, that I had to add some Tabasco to add some favor and even then it was sad. Fresh juice is supposed to be flavorful and vibrant. I had high hopes for this place"}
{"text":"I ordered the G&P Veggie Burger with vegan cheese and a side of sweet potato fries. The burger itself I would rate a 6.5/10. I have yet to discover a really tasty veggie burger. It was decent but could've been better, especially for the price. On the bright side the sweet potato fries were DELICIOUS. A+ on that. I give this place 3 stars because I'm hopeful that they have really good food, I'll be going back again sometime in the future to try some other things."}
{"text":"I have been in love with Greens and Proteins for a few years and I love they are now open in the North. 

The menu is diverse and there is something for everyone as the name suggests. What is misleading but then becomes impressive is that you can have meat like bison and ahi tuna. 
I have a few favorites. Their large low carb caesar with chicken and cheese croutons is a definite meal. I barely finish it but I do! The carrot ginger soup is out of this world and is made to order using a Vitamix. My other go to is the turkey fontina broccoli frittata served with a salad. I tried the raw nachos, I am not a fan but raw food people with enjoy it. I also love that they have a delicious cucumber water that is offered as well. One thing I do know, I need to leave my comfort foods and try some new things on the menu because I will not be disappointed, that I know. I forgot I had the gluten free pizza and it was good, but not a total fan of the crust, but then again I am picky

There is no outdoor seating at this location, I will miss bringing Henry the Dog with me. The interior is bright and cheery and I love that they have stayed with metal utensils and interesting bowls and plates, it is a nice touch. My only minor complaint and it is me personal, the music always seems to be loud and if you are having a conversation it is like being in a bar and is on the noisy side. 

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"OMG... I was in food heaven! :)  My friend and I decided to give this place a try because we were hearing such good things about it and about their vegan options.  So this what we ordered and shared:

1st dish:  Tofu and Soy Chorizo burrito...oh man, this was awesome.  The burrito was perfectly spiced and tasty.  I'm sure that any non-vegan would have never guessed that this was a vegan dish... it was that good.  The chorizo was da bomb!  The dish even came with tofu nuggets, which was amazing too.  They really need to add tofu nuggets as an appetizer.  I could eat that all day... just pop it in my mouth.

2nd dish: Granola toasted french toast... ok i must admit, that it wasn't  vegan because of the type of whole wheat bread that they used.. but it was all good with me cuz they didn't use egg to coat the granola to the bread.... so i just decided to try it.  It was delish!!!  The granola was mixed in with nuts, and raisins...mmm, mmm, mmm.  I felt like my breakfast turned into a dessert, but at the same time, it just tasted healthy. :) 

this place is like halfway between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant... but to my surprise the dishes were visual appearing.  They took time to make it look pretty and presentable.   I was so hungry and the food looked so good, that I didn't take any pictures of my food.   I also think that the dishes are reasonably priced.  We paid less than $20 for both dishes....I love paying $20 or less for 2 people when I go out to eat.  Hey, when the food is good and the price is right, then that's an awesome deal. 

 I will go back for sure and order more off the vegan menu and try to take pics of it before I feed my face.  I recommend you try this place out and your taste buds will say thank you."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere. I ordered the chorizo burrito since it was a vegan option. Nothing amazing where it wild my taste buds. Same goes for the banana peanut butter smoothie. Total for the 2 was around 19 dollars. Id definitely come back and try other things. They also should expand their vegan food options."}
{"text":"After a few days of eating some rich and heavy food, my group wanted to be a little bit healthy. This definitely hit the spot for healthy! 

Service:
Nothing too surprising. It is a place where you order at the counter and you sit down, while the food is prepped and brought out to us. The workers were very friendly. Also, the time it took for the food to come out was extremely quick! 

Food:
This was a refreshing meal because everything was so natural and so clean. Everyone enjoyed the food and the smoothies were delicious. I will say that I was surprised from the jicama fries. I did not know it was a vegetable and when I put it in my mouth, I was extremely surprised because I was expecting deep fried goodie. But overall, it was good. 

Atmosphere:
Very casual and very chill! Nothing to special, but the aesthetics match what they are selling. 

I would come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for those into the health food lifestyle, or just anyone wanting a delicious, healthy meal or yummy smoothie. I love almost everything on the menu, especially their smoothies and breakfasts. It's a great place to sit and do some work on the laptop, or to get some fuel after a hard workout at LVAC."}
{"text":"I didn't feel guilty eating this meal after my work out. Got a chicken cabbage wrap with a Portobello mushroom. The mushroom had an amazing taste. I could eat this all day."}
{"text":"Always out first stop when we go to Vegas! Great healthy eats! The bison wrap is amazing!"}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins is by far my favorite restaurant in the  Rainbow Sunset Pavilion plaza.  I work right in the area and have been to G&P probably a dozen times.  Their food is super consistent in quality and always delicious (well, as good as healthy food can be).  The chicken quinoa salad is my favorite.

A basic lunch and juice will run close to $20, so it's definitely not a cheap bite.  However I think the quality of the food is completely worth it.  Plenty of parking around.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Five stars because this is the healthiest and delicious food restaurant I've found in Vegas with such a flexible menu! I'm definitely going to be back here A LOT and maybe even for a work + food session. Most of the food items breakdown the macros and there's many ways to have your meal prepared. The icing on top for me is the cucumber lemon water. No wonder there are five locations in Greater Vegas."}
{"text":"I like to imagine everyone wants to shop at whole foods on a regular basis, but of course the luxury of doing so involves shelling out the dollars for a fraction of items, as opposed to the loads of groceries you can get somewhere else. But this isn't a review about whole foods is it? I always think these health food places are just a fad, I reference that specific store because they are known for fresh deliciousness, I visit it from time to time, buying $15 juiced items when I feel like I want to support John Mackey and Rene Lawson Hardy. I love the movement of natural produce, I don't love the prices though, but let me just say Proteins and Greens surprised me, I honestly thought I would have I regret my purchase but I was fine! No buyers remorse!
First of all big shoutout to the cashier for so pleasantly manning the line, the situation was heavily trafficked and she did it effortlessly! She prescribed the right thing for me to try and now I fell in love with this lil gem of a healthy dine spot.
Bison cheesesteak and tofu fries. Let me just say I hate tofu (except one specific dish that my friends mother makes)... These fries will change your tofu-hating life. DELICIOUS.
Ok. Let's talk about the \"Wellness Drink\"
Green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed, agave 

You know what. Done talking. 

'Twas a spectacular first for me.

4 star, it is a little pricey- If I'm already spending that I expect all organic.
Plus side: Whole Foods juiced drinks you get a tall for like what? 12 bucks
Here you're getting a Venti for 7.50"}
{"text":"First place I go to eat when I'm in Las Vegas!  Great healthy food!"}
{"text":"Great food the chicken wrap is great. They even have a small Vegan menu with pizza and nachos. Overall great place for a healthy living."}
{"text":"Consistent and delicious!  try the wellness drink! I can eat here everyday. The barbecue chicken pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"Had the bison burger. It was pretty good! Added avacado for extra $$ 

Smoothies were watery. Had the chocolate veggiechino."}
{"text":"How difficult is it to listen to an order and get it right?!?... Apparently it's impossible for this dude,  shawn
Thanks for ruining my lunch...SKIP THIS PLACE, NOT WORTH IT...
Rude, ober expensive, Blah, at best....."}
{"text":"For my 50th review I wanted it to be a place I newly am in love with which is Greens & Proteins! I've visited them three times now and each time is amazing. They have an amazing menu of healthy items suited for any diet from Atkins to HCG. G&P has it covered.

On my first visit I ate their Crab and Avocado lettuce cups. It was very tasty and healthy. The lettuce cups came loaded with real crab! Definitely worth the $9.99 price tag. I also had their Wellness Drink! Let me tell you I am totally in love with their Wellness Drink (minus the pineapple cause i'm allergic). It only has 286 calories and  tastes amazing. I love the green grapes and the fact that they use agave nectar is perfect for my diabetes!!! 

On my next couple visits I ordered the Wellness Drink of course, but I brought my husband so I could try his drinks too! He tried the Apple Pie Smoothie. It totally tasted like apple pie! The one he got the other day though is almost as good as the Wellness drink ,but it's called the Tofu Banana Split! YUMMY! You can't taste the squash or any veggies that are in it. I recommend this one for your pickie eaters!

Greens and Proteins has a nice friendly staff and they are pretty knowledgeable about the food. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of the ingredients makes it worth it to me. I can't wait to go back to try some of their other food items, but I'll be back every chance I get for that Wellness drink!"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking and dancing, we came here the next morning. I got the Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie and it is simply, hands down, the best smoothie I've ever had in my life. I could call it a vegan milkshake instead, because it tasted JUST like ice cream. Places like this not only make it easy to be vegan, but so rewarding. My friend got the Apple Pie Smoothie and she really loved it. We both agree this is the best smoothie place as of yet. Gotta come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Generous proportions... Thank you Greens and Proteins!"}
{"text":"Lately I've noticed myself going here at least once a week. I eat extremely healthy and when I'm itching for a cheat meal I come here. Still healthy but just naughty enough to satisfy that burger craving. And if I choose for my cheat meal to be a burger it needs to be their bison burger.. always satisfies and cooked perfectly. The customer service is great!"}
{"text":"I live this place and wish there were more places like it in Las Vegas. I usually get the Greek scramble. It is healthy and only $6.95. Can't beat it. Everything on the menu is really tasty. The mock lettuce chicken wraps are another one of my favorites. If you're hungover hit a few rounds of the complimentary spa water. Stay with G n P!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I feel no guilt ordering a burger here since they design their food to suit athletic people. I love coming here after my workouts because i feel it's the perfect fuel I need! 

I've had some of their wraps and sandwiches and they're always amazing no matter what I get. Only thing I'm not really into is the jicama fries. I love jicama but they put a strange seasoning on them which I can't tell if I like or not but I usually can't eat them all. Only a couple. The tofu fries aren't bad at all! 

They also have awesome juices and smoothies that make you feel like a million bucks! I truly love the concept and wish there were more places like this all over town."}
{"text":"They have the best green smoothies and I've never been disappointed in the food. We called an order to go and Raul was super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"I came here in the later afternoon to have a smoothie with some friends.  I've been here once before and had an OK experience.  Today was the same.  

Today I decided to just get the Loaded Antioxidant Chiller for $5.99.  It had green grapes, blueberries, beets, pomegranate, agave nectar and ice.  To me, it was a little too sour for my taste buds.  There were a lot of seeds and kind of got irritating after a while.  A friend of mine had the wellness drink so I tried that too.  I found that it was more of my \"speed.\"  Lots of greens and grass, etc.  

What I really appreciate is that this place is clean.  The colors are simple and crisp.  Combined with the food, you just feel like your body and mind is cleansed when you're done.  If you're ever in the mood for a healthy meal, go and try this place out."}
{"text":"Greens and proteins is amazing! Whenever I'm needing a low calorie snack I come here since I'm always watching what I eat :) I've tried the veggie burger, tofu fries, jicama fries, soyrizo tofu burrito, and all of the pizzas! The veggie burger is good and not dry and I love that they have the option to wrap it in lettuce. The jicama fries are a little weird since it's literally a cold root. Their tofu is awesome, it's firm and crispy which is definitely hard to make on your own. The Greek pizza on pita dough is to die for (it's also super low in calories.)

Everything is extremely delicious and priced fairly, which is surprising since healthy or low calorie foods cost a fortune nowadays. They also have a HCG menu which is awesome for dieting. 

 I also like this location since it is pretty spacious and everyone is super helpful and friendly. Great staff and clean tables! I highly recommend this establishment. They are also available on postmates which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great service: happy and patient hostesses and chefs.
Truly healthy food, and delivered fast!
Does it cost more than the average fast dining, of course, but you get way more nutritional value and the taste is fantastic.
I had a bison plate with broccoli, avocado, and walnut cilantro pesto. Delicious!
My girlfriend had the grilled turkey breast plate with broccoli, portobello mushroom, and the walnut cilantro pesto. She raved about it!
We split a Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie which tasted just right and was loaded with fruits and veggies!"}
{"text":"love the turkey burger :) after a great workout!"}
{"text":"1st time here to check it out. We ordered 2 regular size Peanut Butter - Banana smoothies. I did not really pay to much attention to the list of ingredients. I was perplexed when they both came out green and gritty. The flavor was different and thats fine but I really was not expecting it to cost me $17.00 for 2 regular size smoothies. Really? Not coming back for smoothies but the food looks great. Good ingredients but it will cost you. I'll stick to Jamba Juice for my smoothie fix."}
{"text":"I needed something healthy and delicious. This was the place to go. Full in a not so bloated and horrible way, I ate like a queen. 

Grabbed the berry salad, 7 vegetable soup, grilled chicken wrap, Turkey bowl. Everything was so good and tasty. The Turkey bowl was probably the one entree that didn't have much wow factor. 

Great staff. Great ambience. Great tables.

Would come back here when I'm in Vegas without a doubt."}
{"text":"Love, love, love greens and protein. Delicious, smart clean eating with a modern,  simple approach. Modern in relevant and appealing food the young fit family will want but approachable to families and the older generation without the trendy, cliché power foods of the moment.  Service is friendly and prompt with knowledgeable staff. There is a chef in the house so expect quality and high standards not just teenagers heating up 'healthier' cuisine at your local chain smoothie shop.  

My favorite meal items are the bison cheese steak on a Savoy cabbage wrap with tofu fries or the bbq chicken pizza gluten free crust. The smoothies are pricy at about $8 each but you do get very high quality fresh ingredients.  I recommend trying the free cucumber water that is on tap to enjoy.  Hydrating abs pallet cleansing.  G&P is always a great clean eating choice.  Simplicity in healthy offerings done with high standards."}
{"text":"Gave this palce a second chance.. i totallg dig it now! Love the wellness green shake totally healthy for you.. try their bbq chicken pizza and margerta pizza.. im so going here for pizzas now good bye papa john's and pizza hut hello to gourmet pizza and you dont feel guilty about it cause its healthy!"}
{"text":"Omg!! This place is so so so good!! We got the ranch BBQ chicken pizza and it tasted better than CPK and its healthy!! We will quickly be regulars here because it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here too much!!! The quick and healthy options fit perfectly with my lifestyle. Plus the friendly staff makes you feel welcome. Ahi tuna tacos are my go to."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for an excellent post workout meal. The food is high quality and the staff is always super helpful and friendly. If you're lucky enough to deal with Kristen, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"This place has definitely lost a couple of stars.  If I wasn't a fan and didn't really, really wanna like this place, it would have lost even more.  I still appreciate what they do, but the quality is slippling. 

The last few visits have been a nightmare.  My fiance and I used to visit several times a week to get pizzas.  The last two times, the pizzas have been inedibly burned on the bottom.  One time, it took so long that we were given a complimentary drink.  The last time we visited, my fiance and I ordered the exact same thing but I got my pizza literally TWENTY MINUTES before he got his.  I really think they forgot to make it, because when I asked the person who brought me my food about it, he scrambled into the kitchen and the workers suddenly hopped-to.  There was nothing resembling an apology either.  Also, the last time I got a Wellness Drink (my favorite), it was still chunky and wouldn't fit through the straw.  Eww.  I didn't notice until I left or I would have sent it back.  The Wellness Drink is SOOOO expensive, but I don't really mind... that is, if the quality matches the price.

A note to the owners of this place (because I've talked to you and I KNOW you read this):  Just because you get busy doesn't mean you can let the quality become inconsistent.  It's great to have an increased sales volume, but customer loyalty is important too.  I haven't recommended this to a friend for a while because, frankly, I'm not sure if it's going to be a good G&P day or a bad G&P day anymore.

I haven't been to G&P for a while.  I'm not really itching to return anytime soon either."}
{"text":"Amazing service, the food is really fresh and healthy, clean environment,clean tables,the most amazing part about this place is that they serve all natural sodas wow, first time I seen a all natural soda machine,this is great and is definitely will make us return many more times back,the greek pizza is awesome, the smoothies are not to sweet just right, the employees are friendly, good Job. THUMBS UP FOR ME"}
{"text":"Big fan of the green lime smoothie and and the BBQ chicken pizza. Great healthy lunch option! I Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I first came here with a friend after some intense workout/yoga sessions. She got the protein cakes which were surprisingly really good. Usually with protein cakes, they're dry, rough, and you feel like you need a glass of water near by while you're eating them, not these protein cakes though! they were just right; fluffy, tasteful and healthy! The two times I've been here, I've gotten the the ginger green smoothie. I love all of the ginger that's in this drink and its refreshing taste. The only complaint I have about this place are its prices. Being that they're items are on the pricey side, it's probably not a place I would suggest going to every day. But of course when it comes to healthy, organic foods, the slightly high price is understandable."}
{"text":"While I have had nothing but good experiences with their branch on Flamingo the Rainbow location has proven to be nothing but challenged. The last four orders i have placed I have either not received an item, or they don't have an item and the only way to get my money back is to take time out of my day to either drive back to pick it up or call ChowNow to get a refund. You would think they would make doing business with them a bit easier. I think from here on out I will take my business elsewhere for lunch. Great Food, Bad Customer Service."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, I've gotten better service at a drive-thru not to mention I even tipped!  From getting the wrong order to taking forever, to never ask if everything is okay with your food.  The smoothie and the sweet potato fries where the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge  55/100

I was scanning yelp for a healthy restaurant for dinner, it was already 7:30ish pm, all the other healthy spots near by close at 8pm and this was the only one I found open till 10pm. Super happy they're open later than the others! 

I have been here a few times before, I've had their smoothies which are consistently tasty, blended well and healthy. (don't forget to use the check-in offer!) 

This time I opted for a meal since I just finished my lifting workout. I got the build your own HCG meal which comes with a choice of protein and vegetables. I got the grilled chicken breast, which was grilled perfectly. Tender and juicy on the inside. And steamed asparagus, which was cooked well. It also comes with a lemon slice and side sauce, tasted like a dijon mustard. Meal pricing is based on what meat you choose, chicken breast was $10. Packed in a reusable container. The portion size and price were just right. 

*** LOVES: 
- fast and friendly service! Cashier was nice and helpful with answering my questions and the guy cleaning up tables and serving orders was also friendly and helpful. He offered to check on my order so I didn't have to wait long. I really wasn't waiting long. ;-) 

- Loved the way it's designed. Clean, open, modern interior. Loved the green trim.
** complimentary cucumber lemon water. My choice of drink is always water, no matter where I go. Have to stay hydrated! 

Other likes: 
- tvs available to watch the game 
- not crowded or busy when we went (Thursday, 8pm) 
- a lot of healthy options, looking forward to trying them 
- new locations popping up all over the valley

Loved this place, will be back again and recommending to others! 

TIP: don't forget if you haven't used it, they still have the check-in offer,  $1 OFF smoothie!"}
{"text":"I feel healthy and I also feel like Im making good food choices when I eat here. Its healthy when I don't feel like cooking or I want to treat myself I eat at greens and protiens, Its fast and healthy. Try the Bison burger with the tofu fries. Its amazing!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have multiple locations and every time I eat in their restaurant, it never disappoints. It consistent and delicious. I have tried a lot from their menu and my go to seems to be their delicious chicken wraps with the spinach wrap.. of course! I also add on their amazing sweet potato fries- which are the best sweet potato fries I have ever eaten. They also have amazing breakfasts here and comforting soups! 

Trust me when I say- this place will NOT disappoint. It's healthy and delicious and you just can't beat that."}
{"text":"You will always feel great after eating their healthy fresh food. I love the bison wrap with tofu fries and my favorite is the green wellness drink. The service here is outstanding! Great people great food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for when you don't want to cook but still want to eat healthy. Not much to add to the review other than customer service was great, food was yummy and reasonably priced. I'll be back a lot during my journey back to being skinny."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch takeout. The meal we thought we'd preordered wasn't prepared, and we were told they were having systems issues. Even when we re-placed our order (two orders of Thai ginger soup and a hot tea), it took at least 15 minutes to come out to us. Their whole setup looked chaotic. The soup was... weird. I get using ground cashews to make something 'creamy' with no dairy, but the texture ended up pasty and odd. It was also under seasoned. To be fair, other food orders I saw coming out looked tasty. Final gripe: the single choice for hot tea was chamomile. No other herbal or green selections (not to mention black), and I wasn't informed until after I'd ordered and paid. Really people? The place was busy and clean and bright, so there must be some appeal, just not in my one experience"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a restaurant that offered really healthy dishes and foods of this scale. I came in here not knowing what to expect. It's a cute place with nice, fresh decorations! The cashiers were really nice and easy to talk to - they explained thoroughly any foods and drinks I had questions about. Though it is pricey, the quality of the food does show.

I got the summer berry salad, which consists of berries, spinach, goat cheese, and raspberry vinaigrette. The ingredients were really fresh! Some of the berries are REALLY sweet by themselves, but the taste can be easily toned down if you eat the spinach and goat cheese with it in one bite. The contents of the salad worked harmoniously with themselves!

I also got the white chocolate veggiechino, which is their healthier version of the frappucino. I don't remember what exactly they put in there, but they put a lot of greens that it made my head spin from reading the description. I was expecting it to taste like a veggie smoothie, but no! It was pleasantly sweet, even with all the greens they put in there. It didn't taste anything like Starbucks frappucinos at all, which was very nice.

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again. Maybe next time I'll try the Thai peanut chicken satays."}
{"text":"I love the staff here very nice people. I love doing the build your own with the salmon. I normally get the chicken but I got the salmon this time and it was delicious. The young lady in the register suggested i try the salmon and it was a good decision I love it"}
{"text":"LOVE the health conscious menu, staff, and environment here! 

3/5 for the smoothie itself
5/5 for the stellar service 
5/5 for the impeccable cleanliness & tree/plant themed decor

I'm one of those people who have a lot of food allergies AND I'm lactose intolerant. 

While I try not to be too much of an inconvenience when I dine, I really really appreciate it when food establishments are happy to accommodate my dietary restrictions and food allergies. Greens & Proteins is one of those places. I got exactly what I wanted and it was not an issue whatsoever (what a relief)! I cannot even tell you the number of times I have received eye rolls or attitude from people when I have made special requests from other places. The staff at Greens & Proteins were so attentive and friendly!

I ordered the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie (mine with no banana & no avocado, with soy milk + extra scoop of soy protein). It was pretty dang tasty. 

I would definitely like to visit again to try their other smoothies and the food!"}
{"text":"Another beautiful day in Las Vegas leads to another trip to the healthy oasis that is Greens and Proteins. They have recently revamped their menu making it easier to find the ingredients to their savory menu items. The staff always has a friendly smile on their face and are always willing to help you with anything, no matter if you are a first timer to a veteran. My wife and I hold the green ginger limeade as a staple here. It's a perfect blend of ginger, limeade, and the vegetables a rancher would scoff at. Their food is always seasoned to a T. The grilled vegetable wrap is an awesome choice for those time meat does not not sound appealing, but for those that want to get their meat on, the bison burger will definitely full the void. My personal favorite is the California grille chicken wrap. Don't forget to get your tofu fries! I know that sounds weird to be screaming out loud, but trust me, their sauce definitely will make you a believer.

The place screams come here and study or chill if you feel like it. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated high.

Ordered their new taco addition... some kind of steak one. and I really couldn't tell what I was eating. Flavors just didn't work together for any effect.

Their green shake smoothie was also so-so... had better.
Place seemed to have traffic during lunch hour, so perhaps I just picked the wrong items? Would try again but yeah the initial discovery was less than impressive. 

Also, way too expensive for the small portion and the smoothies. I'm from NYC and their smoothie prices rival or exceed NYC prices of similar joints. 

May give them one more try as I am on project nearby..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Healthy food, pretty darn fast. My favorite is the salmon with brown rice the lemon dressing is everything! I usually get asparagus. I truly miss the raw pizza though, but this place is a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"So happy this place opened.  Be ready to eat healthy, Lil pricy but your paying for food to go in your body so do the math.  Service is all positi"}
{"text":"Staff are rude and often forget ingredients that are suppose to come with your order. I've been eating here for awhile but I'm fed up with them forgetting onions or tomatoes that are SUPPOSE to come with my order. And I hate being charged for a very small side of dressing one day and than not being charged for it at all the next. One time I was served very dry fries that were literally inedible. Spend your money on a business that actually CARES about their customers."}
{"text":"I would like to add that the owner did contact me to apologize and I very much respect that. It's a credit to his professionalism that he would extend an apology and ensure that he will address my complaint with his staff. Very appreciated.  
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've lost 11 pounds now in 25 days and this place has really helped in curving my cravings and still allowing my to eat clean and healthier!!! I've had the bbq chicken pizza and the burgers here which are very tasty! The sweet potatoes fries are to die for! I highly recommend coming here. Been here 5 times now!!"}
{"text":"Ate here after my buddy was raving about it, but I really see nothing to rave about. I spent close to $15 on a chicken Caesar salad and a fountain drink."}
{"text":"Always happy with this place. Great food, smoothies, service and atmosphere. Love it here"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about this place and finally tried a wrap and their hummus and pita to-go. The California grilled chicken wrap, although kind of pricey, was huge and delicious. I had to save half of it cause it was so stuffed with veggies and grilled chicken. The tofu fries that came with my sandwich were to die for! They were very flavorful with just the right amount of spice and seasoning and came with a yummy chipotle sauce! The hummus was a little bland, but still fresh and hearty. I will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I had the barbecue chicken pizza. Yum! Great lunch and the calories were minimal.  I felt that the price was reasonable. The location was clean. Service quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty eats prepared in a jiffy washed down with equally healthy and tasty smoothies and juices is what I want, and Greens and Proteins delivers. Plus, the environment is modern and clean with TV viewing options to boot. Alas, the only sadness is that it is located on the opposite end of town, which means my visits are limited. 

At the time of this review, you still get $1 off a smoothie when you check in on Yelp, so put your app to work! They have a wonderful ginger concoction, but on our last visit we went with the Wellness Drink, and it was a mean green delicious machine. It is worth stopping in just for a quality beverage. 

As for the eats, one of my favorite treats here are the tofu fries. I realize they may sound like a disgrace to the original almighty french fry, but as a french fry lover, I am here to say if you like tofu, you will love these. They are perfectly proportioned and lightly seasoned. Do they taste like a french fry, no? But, they do taste like you want to eat another and another and another... 

My husband has ordered the bison wrap twice, and on my last visit, I went with a \"Build Your Own Meal\" combo. You get a choice of a protein, a vegetable, a grain and a sauce. I had turkey breast, mixed green salad, and cous cous with a balsamic reduction. I ate every last bite and didn't feel guilty. I love that you can get a complete meal that is healthy and affordable without all of the pomp and circumstance that goes along with a full service restaurant. (Greens is a counter service spot where you take a number.)

They also offer healthy pizzas and options for vegetarians and vegans. However, don't be fooled, it isn't a vegan restaurant. There is plenty o' meat!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Downtown! This local spot has incredible food that I have absolutely no guilt about scarfing down. They have plenty of healthy options, to include vegan choices, which are priced reasonably and the service is amazing. The facility is always immaculate. The staff is always friendly and helpful. GNP fits perfectly in DTLV, and flatters the Juhl community perfectly!"}
{"text":"NO thanks. 

Pros:
+ Nice decor, water features inside.
+ Clean.

Cons:
- Staff do not know what \"vegan\" means.  
- Overly priced. 
- Lacking in taste.

Note: The Vegan Burger is not vegan. The bun has egg in it. Why they call it a Vegan Burger, I don't know?  I paid $10 for a unflavored store bought vegan patty, soy cheese, 2 leaves of lettuce and tofu pieces, really?"}
{"text":"3 stars only because the counter girl is nice. There are currently 2 customers in the place, my food is going on 20 minutes waiting for a chicken wrap! Pretty much never coming back here!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is way higher than some sit down establishments!  They cook everything to order and every ingredient is fresh.  The portions are huge and the selection is very ecclectic.  Any item you get here is healthy and nourishing.  Their soda fountain only contains all natural sodas... and the root beer is amazing.  The food prep time is a bit longer than most fast casuals but its only because its being made fresh from scratch!  The staff is friendly and happy to be there... the decor is inviting. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had the cheesesteak wrap and it was all awful.  The meat was dry and very chunky. It was identical to eating a dry meatball for the entire sandwich. The jicama fries tasted like eating a raw russet potato. Immediately after eating this I felt tired and had a stomach ache. The following 16 hours after this meal was spent in and out of the bathroom.  This is definitely the last time I go anywhere near this place. I'm not mad at them, they tried their best.  There just happens to be 10 better restaurants within a half a mile from them."}
{"text":"30 minutes and still waiting for my to-go order. Multiple people came in after me, got their food, finished their food and left. I'm still here waiting. Said my wrap is still \"cooking\". Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Service is always awesome at this location. Delicious and fresh food every time. Acai berry smoothie is a must and lawash flatbread veggie pizza w/daiya cheese. So. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"30 Minutes waiting for my Taco order. Doesn't work to fast food timing. Come ask they don't know if I order or misplace somewhere. Haha. Early 10:30 am not many customers traffic. I may pick wrong Taco place. HAHA"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is my go to place when I'm out and about. When I'm asked where do you want to eat for lunch, my reflex response is \"Greens and Proteins.\"

Their menu options is diverse. It's affordable and delicious. If you get excited about tofu, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free (or not), acai bowl, pizzas, salads, soups, turkey sausage, angus, wraps, etc...then this place is for you to check out.  Their smoothies are great. 

This place is located near Las Vegas Athletic Club and the members stop by here to grab a healthy meal.  I appreciate them offering cucumber water for free. I usually grab a cup of their coffee here...it's pretty good. 

They are open until 10pm. So if you are a late eater, you can come here. There is sitting outside. 

My most recent meal that I can remember (I've been here more than a handful of times) was their scrambled egg whites with turkey sausage and tofu. Surprisingly, the tofu was good...and this is coming from a person who doesn't eat tofu. I also had their acai bowl which I enjoyed. 

One of my favorite places. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place ! Healthy food that TASTES good ? Yes please! 

My favorite drink is the \"wellness drink\". It costs a small fortune ($7.50), but is worth every penny because it's loaded with quality ingredients and tastes amazing. 

My favorite dinner is the bison philly cheese steak wrap! YUM. It's so cheesy and delicious and I love that it's made with bison instead of beef. The jicama fries are only so-so, and I don't do tofu so I would love to see them offer some more interesting sides, but I'm just being bratty..

The pizzas are yummy, low calorie, and relatively low carb. 

A place where vegans, and low carb carnivores can co-exist in happiness!"}
{"text":"G&P thank you for being so good to me! Everything on the menu is delicious.

{"text":"Came here thinking they were going to offer ORGANIC food and drinks, but what a huge let down. They're selling you a product stating it's healthy, but really where is the health benefit from buying foods and drinks that contain gmos and chemicals?!?! When I asked if they had any organic produce, the gentleman stated \"some of it\" but couldn't tell me what was, therefore leading me to believe none of it is organic. Call me a food snob all you want, but if you're going to proclaim yourself as a healthy alternative then sell non-gmo, organic foods."}
{"text":"Just not good food /:
We tried it 3 times all 3 times were a let down.
We are vegan and are foodies .maybe some of their non vegan choices are better . Just not happy with the food. That being said the service and staff are very good and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"This place was nice and clean. I like the ambience is gives. It's a little pricey and I was expecting more but maybe it was because of the large square plates make the appearance of the food look like there is not much there. Overall the food was very tasty but the smoothie didn't have much flavor to it."}
{"text":"When we arrived to Vegas, I decided to check out Groupon deals and sure enough this place popped up. 

When looking at the menu on Groupon it showed 2 vegan breakfast wrap options. When we arrived to place our order they only had one. Oh well...we decided to go with the Tofu Soyrizo Spinach wrap. We still had money left over and was going to get the Tortilla soup but it was considered a lunch item and not part of the groupon deal. 

We asked the cashier what else on the breakfast menu is vegan? He said the oatmeal, parfait and our wrap. We just had oatmeal that morning so we weren't in the mood. We double checked with him if the parfait is vegan because it said \"yogurt\" on the menu. He said yes, so we assumed it was a soy or coconut base...Oh HELL NO!! We later found out after taking several bites, me running to the restroom all night and calling them back that it had dairy. Not a happy girl. 

This point I would give them a hater review but the wrap was actually good. Maybe it was a training error on the managers part. 

I would recommend the Tofu Soyrizo wrap. It was very flavorful. Right amount of \"sauce\", preventing it from being dry. The added side  of tofu fries compliments the wrap. 

Vegan-avoid the parfait and Everyone else-definitely order the parfait. Although we were \"snaked\" the granola and the large amount of yogurt and fruit can make this a fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"Watermelon Juice is yummy! Veggie pizza on pita bread was good too and just enough for a quick snack for my girls and I. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So glad I got to try out this place. Can't wait to go back again. Just wished they had locations closer to home in California. :(

I ordered the bison burger with sweet potatoes fries and that was the BEST & juiciest burger I've ever had!!!! Delicious acai smoothie too."}
{"text":"I embarked upon this restaurant at the beginning of my weight loss/ healthy life style change. At first, I wasn't a total fan of this place because I wasn't sure what to order, or what to try.  Their menu can be very overwhelming to someone who is beginning to change their eating habits and change into a healthier life style. However, Greens and Proteins is a wonderful healthy restaurant establishment. This restaurant has an easy, laid back feel.  Greens and Proteins provide a variety of food options, even for kids.  Their menu options are also affordable and delicious. If you get excited about tofu, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free (or not), acai bowl, pizzas, salads, soups, turkey sausage, veggie burgers, steaks, or just can't decide and want to create your own meal, well then this is a cool place to try."}
{"text":"I had Straight to the Heart juice. The ingredients were green grapes, honey, avocado pit, wheatgrass, ginger, and lime. The first couple of sips were a bit bitter but overall was it was ok. I did try the Green Ginger Limeade and it was good!

The menu did have a variety and I like the fact you can build your own meal. Overall this place has something for everyone. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I wish there were another one close to me. Every time I am in the area, I stop by. Their tofu fries are amazing. Everything here is amazing. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Prices are outrageous. $10.80 for a warm salad in a tortilla & you place your own order. I know this place is hip & happening. Maybe that's the draw.

Burgers are $9-$14, you place your own orders and atmosphere is non-existent. 

I really like the idea of a restaurant that offers healthier choices. I buy & eat tofu, organic veggies and grass fed beef. They are marginally more expensive  These prices would fly in a nicer setting with full table service, not a place that feels like a food truck experience."}
{"text":"This place is good, I thought it was completely vegan but they did have some items on the menu with meat. The place was crowded, and they offered a lot of juices and blended drinks! We ordered the chocolate/vegetable drink, which was amazing. We also ordered the vegan pizza, veggie burger, and hummus & pita. The food was ok, kind of what we could order at whole foods. I prefer Veggie Grill in California for the food better.  It was really pricey too, for 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and an appetizer, it came out to $50."}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place but the portion sizes and the prices are ridiculous. Even though the smoothies are good and if you check in you get a $1 off from Yelp but when it comes to the dishes at the end of the meal your still hungry. I honestly wish there was a native foods I would be there everyday!

PROS: Food and service
CONS: Overpriced and small portion sizes"}
{"text":"A great place for healthy meals with a variety of options to choose from. I eat here a few times a week as I frequently order meals for pick up through chow now."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so popular. I've given it 2-3 chances since I'm always at the Starbucks next door. Bland food, long wait time and it's not cheap. Healthy food doesn't have to be this tasteless. I don't get why this place stays so busy. I think the food tastes like cardboard and I maintain a healthy diet. To each their own."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this place and I've been there several times, but it seems when the owner isn't around the food comes out a little sloppy, the chicken is not consistent sometimes extremely dry and overcooked and other times very moist and tender, I ordered eggs and there homemade turkey sausage and it all came out barely warm, the tofu fries came out barely warm and shrunk like that had been extremely over cooked, again this only happens when the owner or manager is not around. This food also comes from SYSCO Company which a lot of items are frozen and GMO. 

Something that bothers me more than anything and I notice these things because I used to work for the health department, almost every time this younger boy is serving/making smoothies and the hispanic chef is cooking they are wiping there noses, faces, scratching there ears, or coughing (even with there gloves on), they don't wash there hands or change there gloves, they continue to cook and serve the food. I have seen them do something dirty every time I am in there with those 2 on shift. I couldn't believe I saw the chef sticking his finger inside his ear with his glove and continue to cook, I then cancelled my order and left. 

I hope the owner corrects this because I won't be back for a while after seeing that. 
It's a shame because I really liked this place.

Just to give an UPDATE, the owner contacted me and couldn't have been NICER and I am very confident that everything will be addressed and corrected. Thank You!!!!! I will definitely come back in."}
{"text":"Greens and Proteins on Eastern... I give the food 5 stars, I give the customer service 3. 

I came into this restaurant on my Birthday because I recieved a gift card. After placing a very large order, the cashier (who was the supervisor on site) tells me there are no funds on my gift card. I sat and waited with my boyfriend so he could call his manager.  He spoke to his manager and informed me there was nothing they could do. They ran the card twice. He said I would need to contact the other location to resolve this matter.

The reason I give 3 stars is because of the lack of customer service. I am in customer service myself, and try to go above and beyond for each customer. He did not provide contact information for the other location, nor did he offer to contact them for me. He also failed to wish me a happy birthday. 

I ended up paying for my order out of pocket because we were hungry and on a time crunch. After grabbing a table, I realized we did not get a number for our order. I had to go up to the supervisor/cashier and ask for our table number. 

The food was wonderful! We ordered the wellness drink (my FAV juice!), hummus plate, vegan buffalo chicken strips and vegan burrito (with impossible meat). The food was flavorful and came out quickly! 

The bathrooms are usually always clean and well-stocked. The food is great, the restaurant is tidy; they just need to work on providing phenomenal customer service."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this morning and I loved it. I ordered the Watermelon Strawberry Cocktail. Its delicious. The pricing is not too bad considering everything is healthy. The smoothie I'm drinking is 215 calories. Everything shows how much you're intake is. The staff is really friendly and the place is so clean. There is outdoor dining as well."}
{"text":"I would have appreciated if the guy behind the counter last night would have told me that the broccoli cheese soup contains raw cashews in it as its base. After being in the emergency room for 5 hours last night because of a serious nut allergic reaction, I called this morning to find out the ingredients of my meal after the fact. What a miserable experience. Thanks Greens & Protiens."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I don't have to drive all the way to the other side of town to get a good post-workout meal. Greens and Proteins caters to those that are calorie-conscious, macro-conscious, protein-conscious, those who didn't meal prep, and anybody who's just finding out that eating healthy doesn't have to taste like cardboard.

They have smoothies, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, acai bowl, tofu fries, jicama fries, customizable meals, protein cookies and baked goodies. They have a variety of protein sources for carnivores and vegetarians: ostrich, bison, chicken, ahi tuna, steak, tofu, etc. They have grains and veggies. And I must say, I love how they cook their tofu - it's warm, lightly crisp and flavorful.

My favorites include the bison burger with tofu fries, ahi tuna salad, acai berry smoothie, and my custom combo (ahi tuna with broccoli or asparagus, brown rice and pesto).

The calorie info is displayed on their menu. Food does not have to be laden with fat, salt and sugar to taste good."}

{"text":"I've been to Greens and Proteins several times. I appreciate the quality of ingredients and having a place to eat at on the go and I don't have to feel guilty or worry about how it's made.

My last few visits, I realized how boring and uninspired their food is. It's dull and lackluster. It's almost everything I dislike about clean eating.

G&P offers healthy/raw/healthy versions of classic foods: burgers (beef, ostrich, turkey, veggie, etc.), pizza, salads, wraps. They're vegan, Paleo, Gluten-Free, Raw, vegetarian, HCG, and carnivore friendly. Anything good made there, I can make at home for way less, and have several servings.

I'm really mixed up about this. It very much has its pros and it's cons. Vegas doesn't have a lot of guilt-free dining options, so it's refreshing, service is great, it's always clean, and the staff is super friendly and knowledgable. 

I'm torn. Will I continue to give them my patronage? Yes. The advice I offer them is to start thinking outside of the box. Please?

Food is prepared well.  It's so simple and uninspired. How about doing something like, The Pinterest Clean Eating Recipe of the Week or some shit? Come on G&P!

Pro-tip: Get those tofu fries and whatever sauce they're served with! Amaze balls!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing here! They have a wide variety of items to choose from. It is a little pricey. I had the Wellness smoothie and the california chicken club sandwich and it was 25.00. They were excellent!"}
{"text":"Located off of the 215 and Eastern, near Sunrise Cafe, this place is fantastic.  Service is friendly, food is good, always packed!!!    Love the bison cheesesteak with sweet potato fries.  The bison is so lean but flavorful.  Packed with peppers and onions in a spinach wrap.  The cucumber water is light and refreshing.  The prices are similar to other comparable places.   Must try if your looking for something clean and healthy."}
{"text":"Yummo! Very fresh green juice and a huge portion of it."}
{"text":"Oh my. The Byson Burder- delicious. I have had other Byson burgers- so dry. But this one---- its like every bite is a juicy grassfed goodness. Love it. 

The juices are so good as well. I like how they don't add all the sugar to the drink. They do put Splenda in it- but that just makes the taste just right. You will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"I went into Greens and Proteins this morning with my 3 year old son, never trying it before. I had Kevin as my cashier and he was very helpful trying to find us something we'd enjoy on the menu . He mentioned the new steak tacos they have there so I decided to try them and they were probably the best tacos ive had in a long time . They also have the chicken ones as well but I didnt get to try them. I highly recommend trying the new tacos whether you prefer steak or chicken, theyre awesome! My son got the kids cheeseburger and he ate all of it(which is rare for my picky eater lol) so that means he liked it! Great customer service, clean store, very friendly and helpful staff, I would highly recommend trying greens and proteins, I know ill be back!"}
{"text":"Please open a location in Santa Monica!  Tried the ostrich burger while traveling and need to have it more often.  Great, quick service and high quality nutritious food (actually healthy not \"healthy-like\").  Good variety - want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Finally, a taste of heaven on the WEST-Sideeeee! ;) 

*The bison burger wrap is all that and then some. (Ask for 1/2 jicama and 1/2 tofu fries)

*The chef skinny salad is the perfect combination of greens and proteins, topped with an amazing dressing.

*Berry blast and wellness drinks are a meal in one, perfect for breakunch. (Breakfast-lunch combination) 

Keep up the consistent work, G&P's!"}
{"text":"Who says healthy food has to be boring, bland and unsatisfying? I've tried just about everything on the menu at G&P and the food is filling, flavorful, and crave-inducing. Trust me - you don't need to be a health nut, workout warrior, or calorie-counter to appreciate the great food at this place. 

Whether you're bringing along a picky kid, a demanding spouse, a high-maintenance date, or a complainer co-worker, the menu seems to have something for everyone... And the biggest surprise of all? Even my Dad \"the diva diner\" loves Greens & Proteins! 

This place is also extremely well-run with the type of customer service we demand and expect here in Las Vegas. Best of all, the most beautiful bodies in the city seem to eat here everyday, giving Greens & Proteins the best \"views\" in the valley. 

A few people on \"Yelp\" have complained about the prices, but I honestly don't get where they're coming from. This place is not Taco Bell, folks. You're paying for high quality, great-tasting, healthy food here -- not processed belly fill packed with preservatives that only tastes good when you're hammered or \"high on life.\" For what you get, the prices at Greens & Proteins are very reasonable, in my opinion.

I typically choose the \"Build Your Own Custom Meal\" option, where you pair a grain, vegetable, and protein of your choice with your favorite sauce on the side. I usually opt for the bison patty ($12.99) or the chicken breast ($9.99) and always have a hard time deciding which delicious sauce to order (the options are aged balsamic, spicy peanut, citrus BBQ, walnut cilantro pesto, teriyaki, lemon vinaigrette, or tangy buffalo). The Bison Cheesesteak Wrap is also one of my favorite items ($10.99) and I usually see a bunch of them getting ordered during my visits."}
{"text":"Just as good as the other location I've been to here in town!  This one is actually closer to me, so it wins awesomeness points just for that.  The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food is delicious and healthy, so I say it's worth it.  It's hard to find healthy \"fast food\" but this definitely qualifies.  And it's right off the 215, so if you have 15-20 minutes to spare and want to grab something good for you, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited here after a long day out in Death Valley.  We were tired and starving! I had the black bean burger (fantastic!), with tofu fries, and the acai blueberry smoothie.  Everything I had was delicious, and I devoured it.  My friend had the sweet potato fries - good, but I was glad I got the tofu fries (I'm a lifelong vegetarian, so I love tofu!).  The food is good and the people who work there are super nice.  Will be coming back here again.  = )"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant but unfortunately I had the worst experience on the delivery option . Their website does not make clear they will charge you a fortune to bring you the food, then the amount out of my account was even bigger... no one could give me an answer... lost money!!"}
{"text":"Typically a place like this is not my thing but a smoothie called and I wanted something a little healthier so I checked this place out.  

The vibe here is a little strange.  Feels like an extension of LVAC and I'm the only lazy bum who didn't work up a sweat prior to coming here lol.  The decor is modern yet feels green and nature-inspired.  I really like the look of this place.  

I paid an arm and a leg for my Green Leaf Berry Blast smoothie (note: 1 dollar off for checking in) and I almost had buyer's remorse as I waited in line.  The line moved quickly enough and service was friendly but, hot damn, it took FOREVER to get my smoothie.  It's the only thing I ordered - no food, just a smoothie to go.  And I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  

Finally my name was called and I thought for sure this was going to be an out-of-this-world smoothie experience.  All the hype, all the waiting, all that cash I forked over... built up to this moment.  I try the smoothie and I'm all, \"eh\".  Oh the sweet sting of health-food disappointment. 

I give it 3 stars because I like the concept and the decor, the service was good, and there are quite a few things on the menu I really want to try (pizza, wraps, etc.), so I'm sure I'll be back to update this."}
{"text":"Others reviews are correct. Do not order for delivery. They will mess up order and not correct it when call them. They failed to deliver my soup with order.  The manager on duty said they called and left a voice message, they were out of soup. She stated she could not Credit my account. I would have to call the Company I ordered from to get a refund.  She asked me to hold. She came back on the line and said she was able to Credit my account. Upon reviewing my account I was not credited. I did not receive correct order nor was I Credited. I am not happy with their Customer service. If you say you are going to do something do it.  Do not lie."}
{"text":"Be cautious!!! I'm really sad because I liked this restaurant but my salad had dirt in it. My salad was really good, minus the dirt. Unfortunately I may not be coming back here again. The employees should be cleaning the lettuce. My husband's had a large clump of dirt in it. They took both of our salads and gave us a full refund but did not take the salads back from any other customers in the dinning area. Not okay. If you know about a contamination you should be overly cautious and ensure no other customers eat dirt....literally."}
{"text":"Greens and proteins still a major 5 stars!!!

The angus burger with tofu fries was amazing, huge high quality patie, amazing whole wheat bun, fresh crisp veggies, gourmet cheese... just a very very good burger at a very good price! The tofu fries were a very nice touch, perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and silky on the inside with a very good seasoning.

The Greek pizza on pita bread is such an amazing combination of Mediterranean flavors, all the ingredients are sooo fresh and work exceptionally well together, a must try!!!

The watermelon and strawberry juice was outstanding, deliciously refreshing with just a touch of agave nectar to enhance the delicious natural flavors! Yum!

Greens and proteins is THE place if ou want to eat delicious and healthy, freshly made to order meals at a very friendly price.

Number 1 place in henderson for healthy dining packed with flavors!"}
{"text":"I usually get a green smoothie and call it a day. Today, I decided to purchase chicken tacos and just my luck there was a piece of bone (about finger size) in my taco. I told the young lady and she was nice about it, offered smoothie or to search for more bones. Lol uh...no thanks. I think the manager refunded the money, she apologized but didn't really seem sincere. I will go back but only because of the green smoothies, no food."}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday.  I had their salmon and my husband their veggie burger.   I got food poisonong from their fish and three days later, I'm still sick.  I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"With this new year, my resolution was to not let my love of food and trying new places be the reason for weight gain. Greens and Proteins was the perfect afternoon snack/meal for my in between spa, errands, and gym session. 

It would make sense that this health conscience business would be located in front of the LVAC. The  feel of the establishment is open and chill. The waterfall fountain and plants mounted to the wall gives the place some life.

Now, on to the food. I heard about this healthy pizza notion through a past Yelp event. Curious whether a good pizza could be delicious and low calorie, I stopped in for lunch. Although nothing struck my fancy at first, I ordered the Greek Pizza ($8.99) and sat down to wait for my food. I asked for a cup for water since I saw they had infused water for guests. A faint taste of cucumbers and lemon was refreshing after sweating it out in a hotbed. When my food came out, I was doubting my decision. The crust looked cracker like. After a bite, it was not a disappointment. The thin slices of cucumbers contrasted well with the tomatoes. While the feta and kalamata olives gave bold flavors to an otherwise mellow pie. My pizza was less than 400 calories and satisfying. Instead of leaving here stuffed, it was a nice change of pace. For those lighter days, I would suggest G&P. If I was ravenous, it would probably be a different story."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience. Kayla was extremely patient and helpful in finding exactly what I had the taste for. The food was amazing and I will definitely be back with friends :)"}
{"text":"Best green drink ever! I'm on a long ass juice fast and I'm feeling too lazy to juice so I pop over to this place and order the wellness drink. This was the best fresh press ever! And this point I'm all juiced out but this saved me."}
{"text":"We had a great experience with food we could actually feel great about while traveling which in my book is far better than good. 
 We also had exceptional customer service by the manager, his name was Daniel and after he found out we has food sensitivities he was especially accommodating!"}
{"text":"Best healthy joint 3 mins from home N Decatur/215. Across from LVAC gym and next door to Vegas Discount Nutrition store. They offer an array of healthy and whole food choices. LVAC members with card gets I think 10% or 15% off on your order. 

The best that I enjoy when dining here is their Lean Angus Burger on wheat bun, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion, side of pickle and Tofu fries. I have my patty done medium well and it's perfect all the time! Another great menu item is their BBQ chicken pizza. Crust not too thick, crisp and flavorful! Great post workout meal after leg day lol! 

Another order favorite is their green shake smoothie and wellness drink juice. 
Green shake smoothie consist of Banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla, agave nectar with almond or soy milk. 

Wellness drink juice consists of, Green grapes, green apple, pineapple, orange, lime, wheat grass, kale, spinach, collard greens, ginger, flax seed, agave.

You also have the option to add protein to your drink! If you're in the area and are looking for a healthy food option, try them out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in town for a few days, and am always looking for restaurants that have vegan options (for me) and non-vegan (for my dude). So, let me say that I'm super thankful that this place exists and has veg stuff! But, the soyrizo tofu burrito was lacking. Chunks of unseasoned tofu, with soyrizo (which is seasoned smaller pieces of tofu) and maybe salsa? The potato medley was nice and crunchy, so that was good! Just needs some variety."}
{"text":"Excellent service, employees are always helpful. The food is great taste is wonderful, the customer service is excellent. I would highly recommend Greens and Proteins."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot in town! Great for lunch! Love the salads....food is fresh. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what kind of wizardry this is, but this place makes seriously delicious food for how low calorie it is. Im not normally one for health food places, but after deciding to get back in shape I'm glad we checked this place out. The bison cheese steak is AWESOME and my wife loved the BBQ chicken pizza. All of the items take great lengths to be low fat, so keto-ers should look elsewhere, unfortunately. 

The only thing that bugged me is that while they list calorie totals, they don't have information showing macro breakdowns of their food. Anywhere else I wouldn't be surprised or expect it, but for an expensive health food restaurant it seems strange. 

Its not cheap but the quality is outstanding. We cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Greens and Proteins, the first time was at the Eastern location. In comparison I like the Flamingo location more. The service was 5/5. The employee who helped me was really informative. I built my own plate: bison patty with avocado and brown rice. What makes it so tasty are the sauces. I got their teriyaki sauce for my patty and the lemon sauce for my avocado. I asked for medium rare and it came out perfectly pink. The area was clean as well and they blast their AC. The reason I took off one star was because the food did take awhile, I waited 10-15 min and I feel like the food is a little overpriced for what you get. A bison burger was a few dollars less than my plate and I would have gotten more. All together I spent a little over $15 for the plate. All in all, it was great and I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place. Came back after a year. No longer good. Noticed customers were a lot fewer should have taken that as a sign. Chicken was dry and burnt in my wife's and daughters sandwiches. My bison burger was ok. For the price we paid not coming back. Bummer."}
{"text":"Try the WELLNESS DRINK. It's green and might look questionable but trust me, it's delicious. They're tofu fries with aioli on the side is tasty and a great alternative when you're a French fries addict like myself. Haven't tried everything on the menu but so far I've noticed their burgers and wraps are the winners. The place itself is very trendy and clean. The only downfall of this place are the prices. Definitely not cheap. Expect to pay at least $8 for their drinks/smoothies."}
{"text":"I visited this place after a good workout becuase I could smell it from when I got out of the gym. Just as I was about to get irritated for the food taking too long to arrive, a nice gentleman brought me my cabbage wrapped burger. This was one of the best burgers I have ever had! The meat was seasoned perfectly and everything about it was delicious.

I realized that it takes time to prepare good quality delicious food. I will be going back, and I don't care how long my food takes, because it is well worth the wait. And what a friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Just left there and had an amazing experience. Being new to Vegas from California is a bit rough being that the health food options here are scarce. I was so happy to find this place. I had the veggie wrap and my husband tried the veggie burger, we both agreed that it was the best veggie burger we've had. I took a few bites! the customer service was above and beyond! This is the kind of place I was worried I wouldn't find when we first moved here. I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Considering it was my first time here, it was a really nice experience. Everyone that worked there was super nice, and when I didn't order a drink they offered me a water cup. The place was clean and subtle. Great for an after gym anything really. I had the grilled chicken wrap which was really good. I got sweet potatoes on the side and those were delightful. I just wish it was a little cheaper so I could go more often. Other than that I love it!"}
{"text":"I love Greens and Proteins! Their BBQ chicken pizza is so good! 
I just wish they had sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a doctor and boy was I glad I chose to come! We each ordered a burger and smoothies. 

They hooked us up with the chili cheese topping on our tofu fries and jicama fries. The jicama fries are raw and the tofu fries are deep fried. We both enjoyed the tofu fries more. Jicama is healthy for sure but I have yet to crave for this. Jicama taco shells are fabulous though! Now to chat about my veggie burger and green smoothie. 
Based on presentation, you would expect a bland burger. Especially since I had to put my ketchup on it. It would've been if they created a sauce for it. Regardless this was the best burger I've had in Vegas. Why? The veggie patty did not fall apart when I gobbled it, the thickness of the patty was spot on, it wasn't bland, there were still chunks of veggies but it was well blended and I loved the toasted wheat bun with alfalfa sprouts. The alfalfa sprouts added great flavor to the burger. Slap on some avocado and it would take bring it to home run. Besides my delicious green smoothie, I tried the watermelon strawberry cocktail juice that came out as a smoothie and it was fabulous. I loved the quantity and quality of both smoothies along with the prices. The drinks were so filling and the portions of each ingredient stood out. Perfect balance! 

Overall, I loved this joint. Great customer service, great food and drinks, great prices, spacious seats, clean environment. Oh and I loved the free cucumber with lemon infused water. I can drink gallons of these!"}
{"text":"Love this location, it's convenient cause it's right next to where I tan. The employees there are a hit and miss with being nice. But healthy great food! Check your bags before you leave with your to go order!"}
{"text":"I FOUND MY SPOT! 

I'm a new Las Vegan who loves all things health and wellness and still enjoys being a foodie! 

You had me at organic and clean eats to go!

We have been told amazing things about G&P and all have been held true! 

Food: I made my own plate with turkey breast and broccoli and kale and pesto sauce mmmm!! Hubby got the bison burger with jicama and tofu fries - TOFU FRIES ARE A MUST! 

Service: everyone was super friendly and welcomed us to the 'hood! 

Atmosphere: free wifi and mountain views for this Florida girl were the perfect combo! 

Can I move in there??"}
{"text":"While I do love the great variety of choices on the menu, all of the food I've tried so far is very bland. I wish they used a little more seasoning or something to spice things up some. There is nothing flavorful I've had and I've eaten there a lot. Plus they're pretty pricey for not tasting that great."}
{"text":"this place used to be able to get away with the long wait, small menu, and outlandishly high prices but now it's no longer the only healthy, quick eatery in vegas. 
they have a few standouts on their menu like the satay or smoothies but i rarely stop in here anymore with newer additions to the valley like krayvings, protein house, protein source. 
also they don't use organic products the majority of the time"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I'd recommend the Bison Cheese Steak, BBQ Chicken Pizza, any of the wraps (with tofu fries), and all of the smoothies despite the veggies inside (tried each one)!!  Call ahead if you don't want to wait, but they're pretty fast considering the long line at lunch.  You'll see lots of physically fit patrons enjoying lunch or a snack as the gym is right around the corner, so you'll feel good about eating there.  

My only issue, and it's not that big of a deal for me, is that the menu is a little pricy.  But you figure the quality and nutrition of the food you are getting, it's not that bad."}
{"text":"The food & smoothies are okay.  For the portions served, everything is way overpriced.  The best part is, they're NOT ORGANIC.  Plus, a regular HCG diet is not healthy for you.  For claiming \"healthy\" and charging organic prices, I find this place to be quite the rip off.  There are way better options out there that are healthy, whole and organic."}
{"text":"I called for delivery. In the instructions I asked for no red onions even put it in caps. The pizza came and had them. I called and was placed on hold for ten minutes, I hung up and then called back and was placed on hold again. I just gave up. I have an infant and I can't just throw her in the car to go get the pizza made correctly. I paid 17.00 for a pizza (tip and delivery fee) that I can't eat. Will no longer have my business. I understand human error but being placed on hold twice is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Generally unimpressive--the food is healthy and service is quick. But flavors and portions are kind of weak. 

The Skinny Chef Salad is OK-it has a spicy mustard dressing. 

Definitely avoid the jicama fries. They are just cold, raw slices of jicama with seasoning. 

I would rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place. I wish there were more of these around town. I always order the wellness drink and if I'm there for a meal I usually get the BBQ chicken pizza or the California chicken wrap. I enjoy pizza more so it's nice to order this and not feel guilty as it's around 300 calories. As you wait for your order you should sip on their cucumber water! This place has free wifi and a good amount of seating inside and outside. Both of these locations are right next to the LVAC gym which I like. To travel here for a healthy work lunch is far for me, but my coworkers and I have drove the extra 20 minutes, so I guess you can say its good enough!"}
{"text":"I'M IN LOVE!!!!!

Its happened, finally. I went twice last week for lunch. It's ubber healthy and has things on the menu I would never eat and a couple of things I would try.

I got the buffalo cheese steak sandwich with tofu fries [yes tofu]. Super good!  Went back and ordered their combo which consists of pick your: protein, grain, veggie, sauce.  I got shrimp, brown rice, asparagus, and pesto sauce.  Has calories displayed everywhere so you know exactly what's going in. Also, got a spinach and almond milk shake [sounds gross but it was amazing!!!!!]

Priced around $10 shake was like $4 but HEY you are eating healthy.  Decor is awesome with running water on the walls and bright green chairs.  

My only suggestion: salad bar or make your own salad. Pick your lettuce, pick your protein, pick your toppings, pick from an array of low fat house based dressings?????

Something like a salad expressions??? That'd be awesome. Adding Elk to the menu would rock too!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty healthy food in a pinch. Great for the next day in Vegas."}
{"text":"Perhaps I should give this place 5 stars to show my uber appreciation for having a healthy alternative in Vegas aside from Go Raw and Rainbow's end.

I dig the chocolate veggichino and the wellness juice. Love that you get a dollar off for checking in each time.

The staff is always super friendly and helpful.

Their pesto sauce is amazing and the peanut sauce was yummy yum too!"}
{"text":"Juice bar that does not have a juicer. And no it's not cold pressed. 

This should say enough if you're looking at coming here for juice. Maybe their food is better? 

Super friendly service though!"}
{"text":"It's ok... If I'm trying to eat proper id rather just cook for myself...not blown away with flavor or choices on the menu....the tofu fries were even a bore!"}
{"text":"I love it when a place proves me wrong (especially when food is involved).

I figured this healthy food joint located next to LVAC on Eastern was going to leave me hungry, but their their egg white & turkey sausage breakfast plus the Wellness shake/juice left me plenty full with a little Wellness leftover for lunch. Their tofu home fries convinced me that tofu wasn't as evil as I have previously experienced!

The service is what I would compare to a Panera or other sit down/fast food place. You walk in, order at the counter, they give you a number to set at your table, then they bring you you meal. 

Service was fast & friendly and the staff was friendly and knew their stuff despite looking young (must be all that healthy food!). They don't do delivery, but you can call ahead and then pick up your order. 

The food was clean, healthy and they had plenty of Gluten Free options (bread & pizza crust) to choose from and their was no guilty aftertaste!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. Why would you anyway when it cost almost $50 for 2 salads and 2 smoothies. The salads are literally a big bowl of lettuce, a tiny (and I mean 2 maybe 3 oz) of protein and a few other fillers. Never seen anything like it in my life. What a rip off. As a local I wanted to support the small businesses but after giving them a few tries, won't be happening again. Have tried multiple dishes  and nothing makes me what to recommend to friends. 

For a laugh, order the sweet potato fries or whatever they are called, as a side. Literally all you get are a few slices of sweet potato that have been warmed up in a grill plate (mine were mostly burnt)

Exactly what I'd expect for $50. Not."}
{"text":"I love how close this place is to my house and gym it's easy to drive by before I go home and eat something healthy. I wish they were a little faster with to go orders but still everything is pretty good"}
{"text":"Super clean and bright. Very crowded at lunch time. Was there long enough to see the crowd die down. Little on the upper pricey side. But good quality food. Friendly staff. I have been in another location before. Not saying I won't go back it's good food. There's a crowd there for a reason"}
{"text":"Lots of low calorie options for those wanting to eat healthy....not a strictly vegan restaurant as their menu clearly states.  This is probably the last place I would pick to eat, but we were convinced by another couple to give this place a try.  The food was better than I thought it was going to be, but definitely not the most flavored packed menu.  I tried the bison cheesesteak with tofu fries and I guess I was hoping for a little more flavor in the bison other than just salt...really it's a chopped up bison burger patty put in a wrap.  The tofu fries were all the rave on the reviews...but in comparison to the Chinese salt and pepper tofu squares...they were quite lack luster and dry in my opinion. The service seems like it could be refined, the couple that we ate with got a number with their order, while we did not.  The server seemed to wander from table to table asking what people ordered in order to deliver food.  The decor was bright and refreshing and the Hawaiian music in the background made it good environment for a Sunday lunch.  I probably won't be venturing back to this restaurant anytime soon, but I think the location near LVAC and perhaps for the calorie and health conscious this place is a win."}
{"text":"If your trying for a healthy lifestyle you can't go wrong here.  The emphasis here is clean eating, low fat, good carbs and lean proteins.  I've seen people reviewing here complaining about blandness. I disagree. The food is well prepared and seasoned without being bad for you.  If your looking for tons of salt and cream sauce you're in the wrong place.  I've had the chicken,turkey, cod and bison burger here and they were just what I needed after a workout or on a busy day instead of hitting fast food.  They are the healthy fast food alternative."}
{"text":"So I finally got to stop here for a smoothie right before they were closing(sorry). I bought a chocolate peanut butter banana smoothie because I'm obsessed with peanut butter. It was super refreshing and not to sweet. My girlfriend had the Apple pie smoothie with a hint of chocolate added. I stole a sip and liked it as well. She also ordered the bison burger which they cooked perfectly. It was juicy! The inside of their building is painted a bright green which pops and makes you wake up haha. I will be back to try more and next time I won't be there 20 minutes before closing."}
{"text":"Our go to after training Jiu Jitsu! The food is always delish and fresh! I even got my coworkers hooked on this place so I'm there often. Another reason why we love Greens & Proteins is JULIE ! She is so awesome! She always makes us feel so welcomed and always greets us with a smile. That is sooooo hard to find her in Vegas... a place with awesome food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a few days ago & I was pleasantly surprised! First off, love the bright green colorful decor. It has a fresh feel to it. I was greeted by a bunch of smiling, happy associates. Props to the manager because everyone had a great attitude. The young guy Alex at the register had great recommendations and I told him to \"take the wheel\" and order something he thought I would enjoy.. and boy did I! He set me up with a Bison Wrap and some sweet potato fries. It was delish, mad props to Alex for the hook-up. Ambiance is nice; lots of people on work breaks or fresh out of the gym, chatting happily over their meals. 
I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few weeks ago. Got there and it was already ready to pick up. I didn't even have to wait a second for my food, which I loved. The staff was friendly and the food stayed good on my way home till it ended up in my tummy. Definitely a place to visit if your trying to get more greens and proteins in your system."}
{"text":"We always visit Greens and Proteins when we're in town. Delicious and healthy options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Quick service and great cucumber water! Pictured is the create your own plate: chicken, asparagus, quinoa and teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"The green wellness drink was awesome. It took them a while to make it though which I didn't understand because people after me had already received their order. Must've been a mix up. Either way, still a yummy spot."}
{"text":"So nice to have a place in the Vegas area that is consistently tasty and healthy! Love their salads."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Healthy eating. Great to see a place doing things differently. This ain't no burger joint and I love it."}
{"text":"First time here and my experience was really good. I tried the vegan macho nachos but they were really gross to me so we said we didn't like it and they let us try there veggie pizza . It was delishhhh! The wellness drink is really good too !"}
{"text":"Was looking for a healthy food option while in Vegas and came across this place. Food was great! I had the turkey burger with jicama fries (was thinking they were baked) and the hubby had buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries.  Will be back to try BBQ pizza! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"The people were nice, but what I got wasn't great. The Thai Chicken Peanut bowl was pretty bland and tasteless, but I guess I should know not to get Thai at a place like this. The chopped salad isn't too bad. The peanut butter banana green smoothie was ok, but it sat on the counter for about 5 mins before I walked up there and got it myself so it was semi-warm and I could only drink half of it because of that."}
{"text":"I've just changed my old 4 star review to a 5 star based on the job these guys did catering our party last night. I can't say enough nice things, but I'll try. They knocked it out of the park!!

First, they were so polite from the first time I called several weeks ago to inquire about their catering. I mean they really sounded excited to help me, even though at that point, I was just feeling out the local businesses to see who we'd go with. Then I had made a few changes to the menu this last week, at which time they still sounded excited to do our large order. Then, the day before our event, I got a call from the chef and we talked over all our menu selections and I modified a couple items. My wife can't eat onions, so not only did they comply with removing onions from one of the items, but he made suggestions to add something else to compensate...above and beyond, love it!

Their catering menu online is easy to pick from and does a nice job describing the items. I do recommend the .pdf version as it's easier to read. We had a party for about 20 people, and while we bought way too much food, people were all raving about it and I think every single person asked me where we got it. I was so happy with all the selection. 

We had quite a list:
-Chicken quinoa cups (fantastic)
-Mini ahi tostadas (didn't last long, omg they were good!)
-Thai peanut chicken satay (awesome chicken strips on a stick!)
-Grilled buffalo chicken skewers
-Sweet potato goat cheese skewers (I wish we'd gotten 5 orders of these instead of 1, they are heavenly)
-Tenderloin beef tip skewers (gone by the time I got food :-) a sign of how good they were )
-Angus sliders (didn't get one, but people were raving! This is where I didn't get the onions and   the substitution was made...people loved them)
-Caprese sliders (so good and tasted so fresh!)
-1 each of grilled asparagus salad and the pear and goat cheese salad (both were so fresh and both fantastic) the salads are pretty big. 

My pickup was at 5:30 and these guys were finishing it up on time to the minute. As the guys were carrying some of the items to my car, the chef and his crew were finishing up some of the last minute hot items. It was really busy in the restaurant and I truly appreciate that as I left, not only did the chef take a minute to go over everything with me, but one of the other guys took time to stand and look me in the eye, wish me luck with the party and said he really wanted feedback on how everything tasted.

Absolutely fantastic customer service and food for this catering event that was very important to me and my family! Thank you to the team at Greens and Proteins for making it wonderful!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for healthy food options in the Henderson area. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about their products and always recommend the best new stuff to try. It's always awesome too. 

I've been here many times and usually get the green wellness drink but this time I tried the acai berry juice instead.  It was really good.  Very fruity but still with kale and spinach to make it a super smoothie in case you're counting calories and need  your fruit  and veggie fix. The wellness smoothie is also a great choice since it combines fresh fruit and veggies together for a blend that's really awesome as well. I think both are excellent choices.  

For food I usually get the bbq chicken pizza because it's delicious and only 320 calories for the whole thing. That is nothing short of a miracle. How can something be so delicious and healthy at thethe Same  time? ? Boggles my mind but still keeps me coming back. I definitely recommend this  place to anyone looking to eat healthier but is having trouble making the switch. They make it so easy here."}
{"text":"We had some delicious smoothies here at G& P . Definitely coming here again! The young lady that helped us was awesome! Thanks Kayla!"}
{"text":"This place never fails. Healthy food you don't have to wait forever for, great attention to detail and always friendly. Love this place"}
{"text":"I love the food but I'm NEVER going back to this location! They mess my order up every time and then make me feel bad for it, and then when my remake was ready he walked past me 5 fuckin times like he didn't see me! I'm pissed! Not good customer service! What's the point of calling ahead if ur always gonna mess it up!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month. Great tasting food every time! Delicious smoothies ! Even better mix of fresh juices! They will prepare your food with any substitutions you request and will always bring the food to your table. My favorite are the jicama \"fries\" with any plate. (I usually still order another side of them) The only item I haven't yet tried is the ostrich! Don't count me out though. Maybe one day.. Lol"}
{"text":"Took my Red Hat Society girlfriends-great time had by all. Eye candy everywhere. Cheerful staff. Loved my veg.pizza and took half home. Had 1 problem with avocado ordered extra on sandwich that was missing when it arrived. Tip not included on bill so you have to pay separately. Would recommend as alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Disappointment.  

This place is smart with their marketing and ambience.  I'm just going to give a quick positive/negative feedback:

Positives:

               Space- It's clean and has modern, simple  decor. Easy to sit and chat for a while.
               Turkey- It's real, sliced turkey; not processed deli meat.

Negatives: 

                 Food quality- I'm annoyed how they come across to everyone. They want you to think this is amazing healthy food.  Not one item on their menu is organic.  They also don't have a lot of alternative ingredients to choose from. They seem to have limited knowledge of gluten-free and vegan foods. This leads me to the next negative.

                 Price- It is pretty expensive.  At least 7 dollars for a smoothie and at least 10 dollars for a sandwich.  It would be understandable if they used organic, high quality ingredients, but no.  Their ingredients do not cost much at all, therefore they are taking advantage of people.  

               Environmentally friendly? - First of all, they don't use real plates. (They care about health but not environment.) So they use paper plates.  Okay, at least they quickly biodegrade.  But wait! The utensils are crappy plastic ones.  What the heck? Be consistent. 

Overall, I seriously feel that whoever opened this place does not care about any of the things they market.  I think they know that being healthy is in, and are trying to bank on it.  They should be serving organic fruits, veggies and meats.  They should have a vast working knowledge of other types of foods for substitutions. They should be using real plates and silverware, or using all biodegradable/compostable things.

And they should not be insulting our intelligence. Needless to say, I'm not going back.  I'd rather spend my money on a place that gives quality food for a normal price."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see the day where I choose a healthy green smoothie over a Starbucks frap! Haha this location is right next to Starbucks but I've been trying to eat healthier so I decided to give it a try. 

The line was really long. Almost out the door. I had to kind of stand off to the side because it was so busy. The staff was extremely nice. Their menu items are listed as well as the calorie count so that is much appreciated. I decided to try the acai berry smoothie (acai, green grapes, blueberries, blackberries, pineapple, coconut, beet powder, spinach, kale, honey, banana, and peaches). Yum! 

The smoothie took awhile to make but it was delicious and very filling for me. I also decided on the low carb Caesar salad.  I actually really disliked this salad. Not recommended. Maybe it was the Parmesan crisps on the top or the EVOO caesar dressing but I didn't like the way it tasted at all. However the decor is very beautiful, vibrant green chairs and they have real plants, along with 2 waterfalls against the back walls. Beautiful and relaxing! 

Pros: beautiful decor, friendly staff, free wifi, nice outside patio seating as an option, complimentary cucumber water, tv's along the wall 

Cons: hard to find parking, long lines sometimes out the door 

Would I go back? Yes! Next time I would love to try their ahi protein salad and the chocolate peanut butter banana shake! 

Tip*** I checked in with Yelp and received $1 off my smoothie"}
{"text":"If you're trying to eat healthier, but still have good tasting food, this is the place for you. I've been here several times and everything I've tried has been amazing. They also offer cucumber water, which I love. They also have a children's menu which is great for those of us who do have kids and want them to eat healthy as well."}
{"text":"My go to has always been the turkey burger, however my last 2 visits the burger was very dry. So, maybe I'll try to find something else on the menu. The tofu fries are great, love the seasoning."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get health food in a convenient manner without having to do the leg work commonly associated with eating healthy. 

For being a health conscious place, the food tastes amazing! I highly recommend the pizzas or the bison cheese steak."}
{"text":"Love G&P hate this location. I avoid it because the food is never the same as the other locations and the service is horrendous. Tonight topped it off though, the employees literally played not it with who had to help me when I approached the counter (I had a pickup order that was already paid for sitting on the counter) so lazy and horrible service that was ridiculous. But when I get home my food is so overly salted I can't even eat it. Won't be back to this location for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I always come here when I am in town. Smoothies, greek scramble, sweet potato fries! Yum. The cucumber water is also great!! Wifi! Staff is awesome, friendly, helpful, wonderful. YAY"}
{"text":"Located right in my building I love love their smoothies, wraps, and salads. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"***** update:
I went back and had yet ANOTHER terrible experience!! I ordered for four people and specifically asked for tofu fries and then when I got my food, I politely asked where my tofu fries were and she told me the system didn't give her an option to give me tofu fries with my wrap meal even though the menu clearly stated tofu/jicama fries with wrap meals. 

The girl I was working with said she would go talk to her manager and get my fries out since I'd ordered them and she went to the back and never came out. I literally was astonished that she didn't even come back to check in. 

The first time I went to this business it was closed prior to door closing time and
when I went back to try AGAIN I had terrible customer service makes this a place not worth EVER going back to. 

If they can't treat their customers with even enough respect to walk back out to the table and tell me you weren't giving me fries that the menu said came with me meal and I ASKED for when I was ordering, then I'm not even sure why they are in business. 

I wasted money at this establishment. 
There's many other places to eat at whose employees care about treating their customers as customers.  

Go to another restaurant and don't waste your time OR money here."}
{"text":"Good food , good price , good service 

Turkey burger is what I had with an egg, and sweet potato fries . First time trying sweet potato fries and they were actually good at least at this place been here 3 times just last week since moving to the area"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to return here, as I was fed up with the constant mistakes, however they have been spot on since. Glad I came back, as the food is delicious and good for ya."}
{"text":"I try to eat healthy, I do, so I checked out G&P to see if it lives up to the hype.  I had dinner here on Monday night with a vegan friend and it certainly has that SoCal, clean and green vibe going on.  The staff is super friendly and greeted us warmly as we perused the menu.  I'd already looked it up online prior to arriving and I just cannot believe their smoothies and wellness drinks cost so much!  You need a healthy wallet to drink healthy there!  Even with a Yelp check-in that gives you a $1 off, I still could not justify spending even $6.50 for a smoothie.  So, I went with the turkey club in a wheat wrap with tofu fries.  The wrap was great and the tofu fries were...interesting.  I just kept wishing they were real fries, but I did say I TRY to eat healthy.  My friend had the vegan pizza and she loved hers, but she also is a regular customer and has a much healthier wallet than I do.  I find it interesting that this joint which promotes health and wellness also advertises that it has an HCG-friendly menu--isn't HCG unsafe, illegal, and not approved by the FDA?  Anyway, overall, if you're vegan, vegetarian, or want to take a walk on the healthier side, come to Greens and Proteins.  They certainly live up to their name!"}
{"text":"I had brunch at this location for the first time last week, using a Groupon before it expired.  I was supposed to meet Suzy H. and her son here, but due to a miscommunication, she went to the Eastern location instead.  No problem.  Intending to share my food, it just meant that I ate two breakfast items all by myself, the Granola Crusted Whole Wheat French toast and the Greek Scramble.  Sure, I could have taken leftovers to go, but I just kept eating until there was nothing left but the parsley.  I guess I was hungry from my earlier swim, but it was also because the food was really good.  I'd been to the Eastern location about two years ago and had a so-so experience for dinner, so much so that I've never been back there.  This brunch, though, has changed my mind about G&P.  I would certainly come back anytime for a morning meal.  I had excellent service throughout, and, contrary to my own belief, the cost for breakfast wasn't as pricey as I thought it would be, $13.94 for both dishes.  Of course, having my Groupon handy made it even cheaper, but still.  I look forward to returning by myself, or with Suzy H., or with anyone else who wants to have a healthier breakfast at a decent price.   

P.S.:  Suzy H. and I ended up eating breakfast together after all, via cellphone.  That's what friends are for :)"}
{"text":"I know I wrote a review for this place when it first opened and now it's nowhere to be found so.....
We are fans!  This is the nearest G&P to our house and we come here often.  I usually get the Acai Berry Smoothie with whey protein added.  I like this tasty smoothie berry much, especially because I get the extra smoothie in a second small cup so that none is wasted.  My second go-to is the combo meal of turkey, sweet potato, and broccoli which is a perfect meal for me when I'm really trying to eat clean.  The staff is friendly and the space is always clean."}
{"text":"Great, healthy place if you want a fresh juice after your long weekend of drinking alcohol! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I had the green shake and the turkey club wrap and both were very good! Everything was so fresh. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and this is a perfect spot for healthy eating. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink offerings, but the teenage employees have no hustle what-so-ever. I'll try again another night, but I was not impressed with how slow they were moving. Again, I may have caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because I've not yet eaten there; I've only stood at the counter for 10 minutes while nobody acknowledged me or attempted to take my order. So I just walked out. If I ever go back I will change my rating. But based on customer service, it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place!

Our whole team stopped by during 2 hour game break @ World's. So we wanted something super light.

I ordered:

Wellness drink
SW Tofu, Soy Chorizo, and 1/2 Avocado  in a wheat wrap (Which the young lady confirmed is vegan)
Raw Vegan Chili Cheese Fries - Jicama fries sprinkled with spices and topped with cashew cheese, blended pumpkin seed chili, onions, and diced tomatoes.

Which I split both with my sister and it was super filling!

They have a lot to choose from. Pancakes, Salads, Wraps, Juices, Pizza, Vegan items, and they even have a small Raw Vegan section.

I am absolutely in love with this place, food is good, and everyone that works here is dope.

Will def visit the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Go here and get a healthy fulfilling meal.  I love all the delicious food and the low calories. My favorite is the Greek scramble and tacos
The interior is designed so beautifully and comfortable. It's always a little bit cold in there for me so bring a sweater 
There is a short wait for the food to be prepared but it's worth it and I'm sure it's because everything is made fresh to order which fills my stomach nicely!! 
It's always super clean and the employees are always nice."}
{"text":"Delicious food! My husband and I both ordered a wrap, bison and turkey club. Very tasty and filling. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the jicama fries but I liked the tofu fries. The food was filling without making you feel stuffed. Can't wait to come back and try some juice out."}
{"text":"The green goddess juice is wonderful. I always ask for it without the extra agave sweetener because it really doesn't need it. 

I love coming here over the summer and enjoying the cold smoothie on a hot day! 

I personally think that their food is a little over priced and their faux fries are so bland and the texture just doesn't do it for me. 

The smoothies are pricey but delicious!"}
{"text":"The wait time is absolutely unbearable. It took almost 15 minutes for my smoothie to be made. 

It wasn't even mediocre...the fruit did not taste ripe and the smoothie had a disgusting bitter taste to it. 

I was running late for an appointment so I didn't even taste my smoothie until I was half way there and I was so disappointed I wasted $8 on it. 

I did get a burger there before my smoothie mishap and it was good...Took awhile but I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Healthy, healthy, healthy!

The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and seem to care about their food too. The overall place is clean and the vibe is welcoming and inviting. Food is of great quality. Thus, the slightly higher prices. I will follow up with a more detailed review later of my meal but for now I will keep things short and say simply this is a 5 star place for me!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday morning (3/25/12) after a meeting at work got cancelled. I wasn't in the best of mood and my sister wanted to grab a drink at Starbucks. I was craving something different so decided to check out Greens and Proteins because I had remembered seeing it on Yelp.

Ummm... gurrrrl puhleeze. These prices are insanity. There isn't a drink out there that should cost $7+ unless it comes in a solid gold cup. I spent a long time looking over the menu because my family juices a LOT and many of the drinks were things we make at home already, but 5x the price. 

The staff was friendly, but I honestly couldn't make up my mind. I settled on the V9, but was a little curious as to why the girl making the drink was using jarred vegetable base, not stock, in the drink. When I asked the girls behind the counter  about the base, they said they didn't know anything about it and just held up the jar for me to see. Flavor bases, pork, chicken, beef and vegetable bases are chock full of partially hydrogenated soybean oil (transfat) and hydrolyzed soy protein (MSG). No bueno. The vegetable base had a Top Ramen flavor packet flavor in the drink.

I was disappointed that the drink was so pricey and I don't have the guts to walk out of a place after I'm there, especially after the staff was friendly. I took a drink of the V9, and was even more disappointed - the flavor and the temperature was not a good combination. Ice cold salty ramen flavor mixed with wheat grass and dried tomato seeds was what I first noticed. I couldn't drink any more of it but thought if I took it home and heated it up, it might make a nice soup. I ended up giving it to my dad, who juices vegetables 3x a day, and he told me not to buy that drink again. He said the cabbage was giving the drink a strange flavor.

As a dietetics student at UNLV, I would love to see this place get rid of the agave syrup (it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, so it's even MORE unhealthy!) As well, I'd love to see them scrap the unfermented soy bean products - that stuff is so toxic and causes so many adverse health problems, specifically in the thyroid and reproductive organs, that it has no business in an establishment that prides itself on being \"healthy.\" (If these things were gone, I would raise my star rating.)

I'd love to see their raw offerings on the menu (it was a line I noticed after I ordered) and to see their drink prices decrease by 2 dollars. Even though they may be a better alternative to Jamba Juice, it really says something when Jamba Juice is considered the affordable alternative. I was sad when I checked in, AFTER to paying, that there was a dollar off coupon for drinks. Agh! frustrating. 

The place is pretty and the staff is nice, but the restaurant was empty. As long as the prices are as high as they are, I can't see this being any place other than a splurge treat. I may try this place out again, but I wouldn't reorder the V9."}
{"text":"We go to the LVAC right next to Greens and Proteins and have heard really good things about it from numerous people so we decided to give it a try. We did not regret it! The portion sizes were amazing. The staff was friendly and helpful, guiding us through the menu and catering to our particular tastes. (Trust me, try the sweet potato fries)!! The only knock I have on this place is that it is a little bit on the pricey side if you are getting a food and a smoothie but its worth it considering the quality of the  food and the service. Overall great place to eat along with a great experience. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"it was OK. thought this was a healthy joint, got what the cashier suggested (bison cheesesteak, ok i know it doesn't sound healthy!) in a spinach wrap. Also got the wellness smoothie. Unwrapped my meal at home and took a bite and it was pretty greasy and lacked flavor, I couldn't even finish my wrap. The wellness smoothie, on the other hand, was great! i don't know if it was worth the $7.99 price tag since you can get a huge bottle of green machine naked juice at costco for $6. Next time, probably won't listen to the advice of the young kid at the register and ill try something else."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for a long time!

After my work out, I was starving, and despite the Saturday afternoon crowds in the shopping center I figured from what i heard It should be worth it. 

When I opened the door it put me immediately in line.  It wasn't as long of a wait as I thought it would be.  I ordered my food to go and took time to really check this place out while I waited. 

The place was packed, looked like there was plenty of seating (Inside & out)  I loved the earthy vibe with bright green chairs. I took a better look at the menu and noticed they also cater to those crazy RAW and HCG dieters which was pretty cool. 

As I waited for my summer berry salad and antioxidant smoothie, I was so pissed I didn't order the ostrich burger I was originally thinking about. (Damn it, I always tell myself to go with my gut, or first pick) It looked so good. From what i could see they cook just about everything in their brick oven. 

The manager or owner noticed me being nosy, and made a joke, I told him it was my first time, and couldn't help it!  He was really nice, asked my name and told me my order was coming shortly. When my salad was ready he told me that put my chicken in a separate container so it wouldn't wilt my spinach.  Crazy nice! 

Every dish I saw looked great. Can't wait for that ostrich burger."}
{"text":"Great place for green smoothies, juices and healthy food. Some of my favorites are salmon and bison burger. I wanna build up the courage to do get the ostrich burger. :-) for another time. Prices are also very reasonable here. Modern look and feel of th place. Will absolutely become a regular here. 

Yum yum"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite lunch and healthy spot until I found a staple in my drink! Ahh! So upsetting! I used to go 3-4 times a week but haven't been back since the staple incident. I let them know and all they did was make me a new one but I was honestly too Afraid to drink it. Oh well! They stay busy! The food is pretty good! Just can't stomach the staple."}
{"text":"I dig the place I really do. I mean where else can you finally go with your health food waiting in the wings for you (mmm wings, damn eating healthy). Everything you need is here if you're trying to slim down, following Paleo, like eating healthy, or are in to getting more than just the typical bland smoothie. The setup is clean, the service is nothing short of excellent and I will definitely be going back. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because the portion sizes are always inconsistent. One visit I'll get a perfectly sized chicken breast or bison meat, the next time the meat is barely enough to qualify as a snack for a five year old at recess. Some type of uniformity here so I know whether to order extra meat or not would help.

Regardless, the shakes are good and the food is delicious.  And the place is really a 4.5 it's just that this place has to be scored on a scale. When I eat at some places I think wow this food is amazing because A) the process to make was long and complex so I needed someone else to just make it B) it would be hard to find those ingredients to make it or C) it's something new that I have no idea how to make. This place doesn't apply to either of those criteria, its basic and you can make it yourself if you have the time and its going to taste exactly how you think its going to taste. (Chicken, asparagus and couscous - there's no surprise here you know what it's going to taste like but hey its good and if you want to stray away from basic the wraps and hamburger will do the trick). BUT this is not a knock on the place because I will be here every week attempting to counter the fried cheese bacon dough thingamajig I will probably have every weekend. And their juices and smoothies are actually different from what you'll find around town and actually have me feeling better after I down one so even if you hate eating healthy, their juice and smoothies are still worth the trip."}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect at first, but pleasantly surprised.  Had the buffalo wrap - very good.  Felt good after eating there  - so healthy food..."}
{"text":"Easy to find and ample parking.  Ordering process took a bit long, felt like they could move a little faster, but got through it. 

Ordered the hummus, and it was not very good for a hummus lover. It was hard and dry and impossible to scoop up with the pita.  Tortilla soup we ordered was also \"very\" interesting. 

The bison philly sandwich was pretty good however. 4 stars still because they have so many healthy food options on the menu. However I think it tastes \"too healthy\" like you would expect. 
Healthy can taste amazing too. 

It also took what felt like a long time for food, so no going here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This is a health food fast food restaurant which I hope becomes a trend.  You can get great vegetarian, vegan or raw food in addition to healthy build your own plates where you pick your protein and greens or other items.  The smoothies and green drinks are as delicious as they come although pricey.  The service is not bad but they don't wait tables.  I like the wellness green drink as well as the almond coffee chocolate one.  Insofar as food they have gr8 breakfasts as well as lunch.  Try faux chorizo and tofu scrambler in a spinach rap.  Bison and ostrich burgers are available for carnivores."}
{"text":"The food here is good, and I like eating healthy. But there's lots of things the staff does here that make it unsavory. It's not uncommon for me to find moldy berries in my \"summer berry salad\" or hair in my food from and an employee with hands in their hair. I've seen employee's prepping food and taking calls on the phone, using the register with gloves on, answering the to go phone with gloves on then keeping those gloves on to prep food. The menu is good, and the food can be good if there's no hair or moldy berries,  but the people who work there need to be re-trained with health code standards. Also, I notice they get  to go orders wrong (which is obviously annoying) and charge a few bucks higher for the same order than the west location, and when I inquire as to why, sometimes they correct the value and sometimes they don't. I think it's embarrassing to argue about a buck or two with and employee who is just a kid and looks at you like are you seriously arguing about a buck or two.... But, yeah, why is there a price difference? I don't want to be charged more from the same order when I eat at both locations a few times a week. Sometimes they charge you for cheese sometimes they don't stuff like that. I think the place has great potential but staff has room for improvement and need training both in procedure and health standards. This review is based on my experiences at the Eastern location."}
{"text":"Great selection for normal people and crazy fitness freaks. Staff is very accommodating. Go here."}
{"text":"Pretty good. 

Nothing exceptional in my opinion. Been here a few times and have enjoyed grabbing a smoothie. This time we came with friends to grab a quick bite.

 We shared the steak salad. Friends had the pancakes and an egg white Mediterranean scramble. Portion sizes seem to vary. The scramble was really small and sparse on the plate while the pancakes were huge and filling. Our steak salad was good, nothing amazing. We enjoy making delicious salads at home so we weren't incredibly impressed. Must have been about 3-4oz of steak which is not a lot for $14. 

Also, syrup for the pancakes were brought out in 3 separate plastic to-go containers with lids. Each container was barely filled. Seemed like a real waste of plastic for people dining in. Might as well just fill up one or put the syrup in a dish and save the environment and keep their costs down on plastic. Just a thought. 

Definitely a fast causal and healthy option if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and the smoothies are even better! I get the Green Smoothie- no stevia, it's the bomb.org. Staff is really nice and the decor is lovely. The green accents are calming and it just feels really clean and inviting. This is my go to for when I am in the mood for \"fast food.\" LOVE!"}
{"text":"So time for an update, :D The staff definitely stepped it up which is a bonus. They greet you as soon as you're in the door. I ordered the Wellness drink again and YES it was blended but, I just can't knock it, it is DELICIOUS and still healthy also. Didn't order food but, I'd go back for the smoothies they are worth every penny"}
{"text":"The best green smoothie I've ever had.  I will go back before I have to head home out of state. 

This place was clean & the service was great. I kept looking at the food items everyone else was having & they all looked delicious. 

I am very happy I found this place."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian pizza with vegan cheese. It was great tasting and full of a variety of vegetables."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding and it unbelievable menu of healthy items. Staff was very friendly and accommodating in the food was not expensive. If you're looking for a place with a wide variety of healthy options this is the spot to go to. I had the fish tacos wrapped in Buttercup lettuce several times with mango salsa and it was just amazing. They do tofu fries that are out of this world and a variety of different bowls made with brown or white rice or whatever it is you would like. Great place to check out and reasonably priced and the place is also clean"}
{"text":"Great location and staff! My house is by their Henderson location on Eastern and 215 but I had a few (minor) problems over there such as double transactions and missing entrée items. This location hits the spot for me because it's quiet and they don't get busy. Friendly staff and good vibes! 

In terms of food, I can't complain about one thing. I love everything. Flavorful yet healthy at the same time. Makes my tummy happy :)
I always get the ostrich burger with tofu fries for dinner and Greek scramble for breakfast. 

Health is wealth & I do not mind paying extra for food like this."}
{"text":"Love this place ! I will be back . The service was outstanding and welcoming I left feeing satisfied"}
{"text":"I never thought I would find a delicious AND healthy yet affordable option in Vegas. I try to go here every time we are in town. Nothing cures a massive headache from a night gambling and partying that a good healthy juice or shake. I always take to go and bring it back to the hubby in our hotel room. Nice little \"local's\" secret."}
{"text":"Not great. $13 for some yellowish romaine, a chicken breast and some dressing. Next time I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite! Even when I stop by late after work, and they're about to close, they give me great service and the food is always spot on. Tonight I tried something new to eat, but stuck with my must-have drink: The Green Shake. For me, it's the perfect balance of healthy and tasty. It has banana, almonds, mango, orange, apple, avocado, spinach, collard greens, kale, vanilla and agave nectar. Think it sounds like too many greens, or like it will taste \"weird\"? I promise you won't feel that way once you get a taste! This drink is truly mouth-watering. Not to mention all of the vitamins and nutrients it offers for a health and wellness boost!
For my meal I ordered an Ahi Protein Salad, which I was worried wouldn't be enough food to satisfy my appetite; it definitely was! The salad was huge, and delicious. I love seared Ahi Tuna, and it was nicely complimented by the artichoke hearts, avocado, egg, portabella mushrooms, baked tofu croutons and sunflower seeds. The citrus vinaigrette was light and very flavorful, too. I will definitely be considering the salads here as substantial meal options from now on when I go in on an empty stomach like I did tonight."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Vegas! It is amazingly delicious and healthy. The strawberry watermelon drink is a MUST! I highly recommend. 

Although it is a bit away from the strip it is worth the uber or taxi there!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Green Ginger Limeade! Also, this place has nice ambiance... aka attractive women hanging out after their gym sessions. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"I got the green shake and hummus and pita. The shake was good. Not great, but good. I'd get it again for sure. The pita came out and looked really tasty. I was very hungry so I dug in right away. There was two flavors of hummus, plain and maybe red pepper? They were both super bland. No flavor whatsoever and a weird consistency. Not smooth and yummy but kind of dry and grainy. A little olive oil was drizzled on top but even that didn't give it any flavor. Don't be afraid of garlic and spices!! A little salt and pepper even? Idk, I might come back for a smoothie but I doubt I'll try the food again."}
{"text":"This place is the best. It's worth the price, why not invest in your health? Food tastes great and everyone there is awesome, I basically live at here."}
{"text":"Thought I should update my review after eating here two more times. Last year I was invited back by the manager/owner to give them another shot. I brought a friend with me so I could get a second opinion. I made the mistake of ordering the same chicken wrap, thinking it would be better the second time around. Nope. My friend had the Bison wrap and loved it. I hesitated to update my review because I still wasn't impressed by the food, but didn't want to post a negative review when I knowingly ordered something I didn't like the first time around and my friend loved his wrap. But seriously, if you're healthy food joint and can't make a good grilled chicken wrap... what can I say?  I tried it again one more time and had the turkey burger, which while it needed some salt - was much better than the chicken wrap. The tomatoes were a way overripe ... but it wasn't bad as a whole. I still love the idea of the jicama fries, but they could really do something to make them tastier, like a citrus dressing option or something.. anything. LOL. All in all, I might eat here on occasion - but for what it is I think it's way overpriced. I spent $17+ today for the burger and a juice drink. Definitely not affordable or good enough for a daily lunch option. The place is busy, busy though... so it doesn't look like they're hurting for business."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying this location out today for the first time. Got my order to go, staff member was very friendly and very diligent. Nothing short of great in that department. 

The \"Greens and Proteins Breakfast Wrap\" w/ Spinach Wrap- it lacked a little on the flavor, and was surprisingly messy. Couldn't say that I was a fan, and no amount of tofu fries could make up for this dish. 

The \"Southwest Tofu & Chorizo Burrito\" w/ Spinach wrap - this burrito was a good one. The flavor is amazing all the while not as messy as one would have expected. A good mix of ingredients overall making the tofu really blend in. 

As always the tofu fries are the best part. 

\"Green Ginger Limeade\" - very fresh and refreshing, could practically taste each individual ingredient. 

 \"Watermelon Strawberry Cocktail\" - not as refreshing as I would've expected, the strawberries tasted almost like preserved ones. Maybe just not as good in comparison to the \"Green Ginger Limeade\""}
{"text":"Best smoothies in Las Vegas, - whether you are vegan or not, these are unvelivable and very healthy, and not loaded with disguised names for sugars like turbinado, cane sugar,  etc. Although they do have honey and /or agave in them so you can ask for that to be omitted, you wont miss it. I love their green shake and their chocolate peanut butter banana shake personally.
They sneak in things like zucchini, and kale, and other very healthy foods and i swear you do not taste them! 
Although i have gone there many times for the smoothies i will admit I have eaten there only twice, neither was memorable for the price, i give them credit for making a difference to give people healthy options, but for example ...the tofu fries are not healthy, they are just deep fried tofu sticks The daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza is good compared to some places versions of it, but the only way to make it truly vegan(unless you want it served on a raw cracker) is to get it on the gluten free crust, after you substitute the crust you are getting charged 14.99 , otherwise if you dont mind the raw crust its 11.99 -in my opinion it is rather small and can be inhaled in just a few bites, i say its 8 inches at most and very thin. Not a great value -If you do the \"build your own custom meal\" they let you pick 1 protein, 1 vegetable, and 1 grains, not a great value, the plate is very very small.. although healthy tasting and not oily to try to make it taste better. but by the time you lunch and the smoothie you are looking at 20.00 minimum and you wont be full after.
Another issue i find is it can be very busy at lunch time, and they only ever have 1 person working the cash register, the line up can go out the door and the seats are all taken during these rushes. , combine that with people asking questions about the menu and being indecisive (me included)I think they should get at least 1 more register to get things running more smooth."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sausage pizza and it was excellent. I see other reviews not liking the portion size. I on the other hand thought it was just right. If I want a piece of cardboard with imitation cheese and sausage made out of who knows what for 10 bucks there's plenty of options. I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for. I'm on a quasi macrobiotic diet so it has plenty of options for me. The layout is very clean and the service was prompt. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"It's always good to eat healthy every now and then. They post the # of calories for their items. It is pricey so make sure you're willing to fork out the money for the healthy food. 

They've also got pizza which was surprising for me. Gonna have to recommend the BBQ pizza one. The others don't sound appetizing to me personally. 

If you order their drinks, grab the epoxy app so you can get their virtual stamp card. Cashier told me their Wellness Drink was the most popular. It's pretty good - if you like grapes. 

My favorite has got to be their tofu fries! I always try to get an extra order to go :0). 

I've been here a few times and there are times where the food is bleh (depending on what you order) and other times they're decent. Aside from the tofu fries, nothing else has stood out to me so just give yourself a few visits to try various stuff.

The turkey club sandwich also wasn't too shabby. But it's definitely better than eating at Sweet Tomatoes every time I want something healthy."}
{"text":"First time trying this location now that I work on this side of town. My absolute favorite is still the tofu fries. Love them! They come in 6-piece and 12-piece orders. 

This location is smaller so it feels more crowded, but I came during lunch time so it was definitely a full house. 

As you walk in, to your left is where the line starts and they have physical menus as well as menus on their TV. 

All the green in the place gives me a nice vibe for some reason, just looks nice aesthetically. 

Green shake is a bundle of health; it tastes okay but at least it's healthy, right?

Their pizza is good last I recall but when I'm here, the last thing I want is a pizza, ya know?"}
{"text":"So delicious !!! Very happy they opened a location close to me . GREAT crew and yummy options for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans !"}
{"text":"Food is so good, I get their Ahi Protein Salad every time I go in. The atmosphere is clear and open. It is always busy which is a good sign. The staff is friendly and quick to get your food out to you. The meal itself is always filling. The food is a little pricey though which is fine it just means I can't eat there every day, but over all highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, so my fat booty decided to start loosing weight, Gotta get in shape for the ladies right?? So I decided to start going to the gym that happens to be in the same plaza as this restaurant.

When I went for the first time, I really didnt feel it. I thought it was a hipster central and such, but still wanted to try it , so I did and I fell in love with some items

The tofu fries and the Margarita pizza are delicious, and I think what makes it taste better is the fact that its only 320 calories for a whole 10 inches ZA!!!

Some of the things on the menu are totally not for me, and the juices, well I rather juice at home. But I appreciate the variety and how its mixed as a fast food joint with table service. really nice, and the owners are super cool as well.

It can get a little pricy but all healthy food is and thats sad. The place can get packed but service still fast and efficient.Food comes cooked right and so far havent have one single bad experience.

If you are a freak of counting your calories intake and want some good food that wont make you look like jabba the hutt , stop by this stop."}
{"text":"So I usually love this place but today was not one of those times. Me and my boyfriend found hairs in both of our dishes. Not once but TWICE! We are not ones to complain but common. When we found a hair in his plate we said maybe it was in accident than we found one in mine and I almost vomited! Told the lady. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food, but slow even if you order to go Expect a  wait. I ordered at 11:45 am and it's now 12:15 with only 3 people ahead of me. I ordered the tofu southwest chorizo."}
{"text":"Healthy options in LV? I'll take it!
Come here after a post workout!
I'm in love with the wellness drink. At one point last week I had it 5 days in a row!
Kinda pricey tho... so I'm minusing one star for that... otherwise... I'm always happy visiting GandP.
Outdoor seating good for dog owners!"}
{"text":"Since my last comment the management wrote me an e-mail inviting me as a guest. I politely declined, but absolutely appreciate the gesture.

{"text":"Would love to have a Greens & Proteins in the Bay Area.  This place made me very happy.  Fresh, quality, healthy fast food.  The portions are generous, prices fair, and menu is incentive.  I could eat there every single day. Plus a juice bar! The interior is clean, service speedy & friendly and good is soooo good.  And good for you!  Turkey, ostrich, bison, chicken, beef, done simply or creatively what ever you are feeling. I hope this place takes off & they open up in the Bay Area. Best lunch I've had in awhile!"}
{"text":"Loved the \"create your own\" option chose a great very flavorful piece of chicken, rice and a salad very satisfying. Wait time wasn't too bad for being there during Sunday brunch/ lunch hour."}
{"text":"Came here around 1030 in the morning to grab lunch on my way to work. I ordered the turkey club sandwich with turkey bacon and it took 15 minutes, there was literally one other person in the restaurant  I dont know if 15 minutes was really effecient for a 98% cold sandwich but fresh somehow translates to slow service. Ive heard the smoothies are great and several people came in while I was waiting and got their smoothies and were gone. Maybe Ill try one in the future but the sandwich was underwhelming and not worth a $9 price tag."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. I got the acai berry smoothie and ahi protein salad. Both are great combination to get your healthy fix for the new year. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"When I actually do have the funds to splurge on a healthy meal, I choose this place.

They have a pretty healthy and diverse menu, so I'm sure you'll find something to meet your cravings. My go-to option is the Create Your Own Meal. This allows you to choose one protein, one green, one grain, and one dressing. Let your imagination run wild here. This is the perfect opportunity to meet that delicious, healthy craving you've been having.

My favorite selections for the Create Your Own Meal is salmon, asparagus, brown rice, and the lemon citrus dressing. I'll have to force myself to try the other proteins one day, but I'm always craving for salmon whenever I eat here. There's a light crust on the salmon, but the inside cuts up perfectly! The brown rice is the perfect texture - squishy, but NOT watery. The asparagus is prepared just how I like it - not burnt, but thoroughly cooked.

I really wish I had the funds to eat here everyday, but it can get pricey. This place is the perfect solution to eat healthy when you're too lazy to to make your own meal, but have the currency to splurge a little."}
{"text":"Second visit here was night and day from my 1st. I think his name was Stefano and I didn't catch the name of the supervisor that night. They were extremely nice. I used my check in Coupon with no backlash this time from the staff. Food was amazing Bison wrap!! Love it!! I'll be back again. I'm happy I have this place a second chance   

Ps 
I forgot to get my fork and knife and the supervisor got it for me. Very nice of her !!"}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere, strawberry watermelon drink is great. My family loves the Cali grilled chicken wrap."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for people on a macro diet! Not only are most of the meals on \"my fitness pal\" but they also have a chart which they will share the information with you if you ask. The staff is always friendly and always remembers my name. The food is reliable and tastes the same every time I order the dish. My favorite is the Greek scramble or the build your own meal option."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken was very dry 
Fries were good 

Turkey club was so dry 
Fries were good definitely worth a try

{"text":"Came here with the hubby for the first time. We recently started working out and decided to start eating healthier. I ordered a burger with jicama fries and my husband ordered a wrap with tofu fries. Before coming here, we heard such great reviews of this place. To be completely honest, I wasn't really impressed. The food lacked flavor to me. My husband enjoyed it because he felt it was a healthy meal compared to the stuff we usually eat. I told him that healthy food can also taste good. He recently went back and had a turkey burger and said it tasted dry. There is a place a couple blocks from here called Elixer Organic Cafe that I think is much tastier. I might consider returning here to try something different one day before completely ruling it out."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming into greens and proteins and I have to say that I am impressed with the quality of food. Although I was a little caught off guard paying $16 for 3 tacos it was very filling, delicious & guilt Free! Today I decided to go in and try their acai bowl (I'm a sucker for those) it was more of a sorbet texture and not runny like other places make them and the granola they use is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"After pondering about going here for a smoothie to feed my hunger I finally gave in. I ordered the berry smoothie it was alright for the price of 8$ I don't think it was worth that. But probably will just stick to my normal smoothie place across the street."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I go there with my daughter at least twice a week and we have been going there for a couple of years now. The food is always fresh and by now the people that work there know me and know what are usually order."}
{"text":"One aspect I really enjoy about restaurants is when they are immaculately clean. Everything was spotless and organized. There are plenty of seats outside the patio if the weather is nice, & inside it's very spacious, with trendy tables, a nice wall backdrop with running water, & several televisions. Service is alright. Nothing going beyond the means of customer service & nothing that's bad either.

If you are anyone who is a raw foodie, don't expect this place to state it uses USDA Organic certified items just because it's named 'Greens and Proteins' (that's a question I'm going to ask the next time I'm in!) The menu is definitely a little more healthier than your fast-food alternatives, with wraps, pizza, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, juices, the works. The pricing was what got me, since I could get a green smoothie at Whole Foods for about .50 cents less than here (one that is a lot less sweeter). 

I purchased the vegetable wrap & the green smoothie, all of which came out to $20 (definitely not cheap, as most health-alternative restaurants aren't). I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the green smoothie turned out! While $7.50 is a little much, at the same time it was in a cup that was generous in size for its price. It was very sweet (from the agave nectar & stevia), nothing like the green smoothies from Whole Foods which are a little more on the less sweeter end. I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing! 

Walking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here. I debated giving it three stars, but I was reminded by my green smoothie it's definitely a place I'd like to return to when I'm in the neighborhood craving a healthy alternative to other restaurants surrounding them!"}
{"text":"We are from California visiting Las Vegas - the hubby and I we're looking for healthier options and ran into this place.  The food was absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"After circling the block twice to find parking. I finally found a pay for- site 2 blocks away (all this to run in and get a smoothie!) . I get in and order the \"Apple Pie\" Smoothie. After ordering it- the manager told what I assume to be  a new gentlemen to make it while she \"watched expo\". I assumed him to be new because then she told him \"for the apple pie smoothie add EXTRA Ice\" And boy did he ever!!!! It was just one big cinnamon ice block! YUCK! I'm certain with all the cinnamon and ice he added that he didn't have space for the almond milk, or Apples, or nuts ! Not to mention his whole process took ages! I won't go to this location again. The one on eastern is much better!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for vegans and for those seeking to eat clean. Their chocolate peanut butter smoothie is delicious, and one of my favorite! The vegan burger is also delicious and it's a must try! I highly recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm doing a raw fitness diet and this was one of 2 places I could eat. The food is amazing and they have a lot of selection. Finally a good clean eating place. Have been there more than 3 times this weeks and plan to go more :)"}
{"text":"The staff was super nice and friendly, but the food here is horrible. The one on flamingo and 215 is way better. The chicken was super dry and chewy, probably because I literally saw the lady put it on the grill to heat it, it was pre cooked. Then I found some weird brown string thing in my rice. So that was the conclusion of my meal, gross and will never come here again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot for dinner after the gym last week. The \"create your own\" meal lets you select a protein, starch, veggie and sauce from a fairly extensive list. The food was well cooked, healthy (steamed, not fried...when applicable), and the sauce was fantastic. I love a menu with good vegan/vegetarian food and options! 

It was fairly priced, the staff was helpful and the place was clean. My only quasi-negative is they seem to be a little slow for takeout. However, this is probably them still getting up to speed. 

Nice plus = complementary water flavored with citrus and cucumber. It was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This has become my new go to place for healthy eating when I am in Henderson. They open earlier than most for breakfast and have a great variety. Lunch is special as well."}
{"text":"Was excited to see this open awhile back.  Finally stopped in later in the evening.  Walked in and out as we felt we were interrupting the employees conversation.  Felt unwelcome and not even acknowledged.  So unfortunate."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken pizza. This is the second most popular dish according to the server so I figured why not. 

I'm not sure how healthy it is, but it tasted like a regular pizza or one you might get at CPK (California Pizza Kitchen). I'm not a huge fan of CPK or anything, but maybe the flavors reminded me of it. 

Service was amazing!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kale Harvest Salad- 3 star. 
Chicken Quinoa Salad - 3 star. 

Both were delicious. I have had better, but it has a good price point for a healthy place. I must try their pizza next! 

Service - 5 star."}
{"text":"First time here great environment! Fresh fruit and healthy egg white omelette 13.22 with tip! Fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we came to greens and proteins for breakfast on a Saturday to try out. Our party of two walked in the door, there was no one in line, yet no one greeted us or asked if we had any questions. After looking at the menu I ordered a breakfast burrito with turkey sausage and my partner had a Greek egg whites omelette. The flavor of the food was nonexistent. It is very rare for us not to finish our food when we go out to eat, but this is an exception for us. The cheese on the burrito was not cooked, tasted awful, and they forgot the feta cheese in my partners omelette! When the server finally brought us our food outside, she forgot forks and napkins. She told me I need to go inside to get those and did not offer any assistance or ask how our meal was. We will definitely not return, and will recommend that our friends and family try somewhere else when they are in Vegas! The Decour inside was very nice, we liked the water fountains have a laid-back atmosphere, but the food and the service was absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Excellent! I love, love, LOVE The bison cheesesteak on spinach wrap. It is amazing! This place is pricy but you can taste the quality of the ingredients. My friend had chicken tacos and he says that they are a must order. The aioli on the tacos had a little kick to it but it was great! Definitely going to try the chicken tacos next time based on his praise. They get the food out quick but get here early because this places gets busy during lunch."}
{"text":"Not so great in my opinion! 

Cons: I had the vegetable smoothie (V9 I think) and it was like water with chewed up celery.  The burgers had so much meat (without any flavor) that the meat was the only thing I could get my mouth around.  It gives the illusion of being an organic restaurant but it isn't!

Pros: The interior is very crisp and clean and the jicama fries were yummy (would be even better with a slice of lime on the side)."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and the food is clean and healthy.  If you want to feel great and look good... eat here !  The kitchen is the cleanest in town and the kitchen managers take pride in keeping tidy.  I hope you all enjoy this great place."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I decided to try this place! I ordered the ahi protein salad and it was BOMB! The servers were very friendly too! And the place was very roomy with great ambiance. I really loved the fried tofu in the dish, it was very crispy and delicious. I love being able to get a filling, healthy meal for a reasonable price. Very much recommended to try!"}
{"text":"If you're thinking about \"healthy splurging\" this is the place to do it. And yes, there is such a thing. It means staying on track with your goals while still getting some enjoyment out of your meal. 

We tried the multigrain pancakes and the vegan buffalo chicken tenders. Highly recommend both. 

Prices are moderately fair. The only dieters that may not benefit from this place are the people on low carb plans. If you read the nutrition facts mostly all of the items have your daily serving for the day in just one meal so proceed with caution other than that this place is a \"Win win.\""}
{"text":"I got the vegan RAW nachos and a smoothie and it was ALL SO BOMB and FRESH and plated gorgeously. The menu is huge and it was very satisfying."}

I want to like this place but def still looking for other options. Came here with my gf cause she was in the mood for healthy and light got the bison wrap with tofu fries and the broccoli and cheese soup... lets start with the soup i know healthy places are known for bland food because sodium is a big factor when it comes to health but a nice little packet of salt which the supply and this soup was edible. Now the bison wrap, not bad, not great nothing special. The bison was again no flavor but noted this is a health food spot so understandable some sauce they provided made the wrap taste better and i ate it just fine. Now my main problem the \"TOFU FRIES\"; if you like this you might as well eat cardboard probably taste better and better for you, this was horrible the texture and flavor was like processed plastic?! ive had similar tofu fries before and they were way better than this, def recommend trying the napkins. Overall i get where this place is going and not being a health nut i cant really complain i just wont eat here and let my gf enjoy it."}
{"text":"Really sad that their juices are not able to be ordered in bottles to be enjoyed later...and as far as healthy, the base of most juices are fruits,I was really hoping for more veggie based drinks..."}
{"text":"Really sad that their juices are not able to be ordered in bottles to be enjoyed later...and as far as healthy, the base of most juices are fruits (green grapes to fit the name??), I was really hoping for more veggie based drinks...for the flip side, I was only looking for juices, I didn't look at anything else on the menu...if I make it back, maybe another star and an update will be in order..."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I'm too lazy to find food food. The smoothies are filling and healthy and ready in under ten minutes. Service is fine"}
{"text":"Salads on salads on salads. 

Why can't we ever have just like, a salad?

That's all I need when I visit Greens and Proteins. 

Their steak salad is divine. Perfectly cooked filet mignon, romaine, arugula, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, roma tomatoes & pickled onions with a caramelized onion vinaigrette. I know right?! It's my goto there, and I've also swapped out the filet for grilled chicken if I'm looking for something a bit \"lighter\".

The Ceasar Salad is simply delicious. Romaine Lettuce, parmesan cheese, parmesan crisp and EVOO Caesar dressing. Adding chicken is highly recommended.

I've never sat and enjoyed my garden treat in the space, but there is plenty of room if I chose to do so. The staff is friendly here, the food comes out at a decent rate and it's nice to have a healthy treat that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Tofu Fries! Jicama nachos! 

Watermelon juice something.. Everything was pretty delicious being an \"almost-vegan\" establishment. Our venture here was not a disappointment after discovering the delicious drinks they had on hand and the tofu fries. 

My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Only had a few misses here.  Nice, friendly staff, great ahi tuna cooked to perfection!  Love the hummus too!!"}
{"text":"I almost go to this place after the gym at LVAC, the bison burger with teriyaki sauce, basmati rice, and sweet potato mash always comes out super fresh. Love this place!"}
{"text":"If you're the type of people who gets excited about organic kale and well-balanced meals, boy is this the place for you. This place is for the health conscious, the clean eaters, the non-meat eaters, the type of people who shop at Whole Foods, and the crowd that hits the gym. It's that type of vibe, if you get what I'm saying.

I like to come here when I'm trying (emphasis on the trying) to be healthy, but I still crave convenience. And I love eating out and eating healthy without always having to settle for a salad (but they have that here too if that's what you're into). Here's the lowdown:

THE GOOD:
+ Healthy
+ Convenient
+ Good quality ingredients
+ Good portions for decent prices
+ Vegan and Vegetarian options

THE BAD:
- Need to salt your own food 
I get /why/ they don't salt their food, I just don't /like/ that I have to do it myself. Buying an under seasoned meal just doesn't sit well with me.

Overall, I recommend this place. You could make a lot of the food here if you had the time, but I think what you're really paying for is fast, convenient, and healthy food. And I think most days it's worth it, even if you have to salt it yourself."}
{"text":"They have the best BBQ chicken pizza I've ever had. And it's only like 400 calories. 
Sweet potato fries are bomb. 
But let's be real. All their food is amazing (:"}
{"text":"one of my favorite healthy spots in vegas. Build your own meal is amazing for someone who eats very particularly like myself. Plus it's great because they have something for EVERYONE whether vegan, gf, or full blown carnivore. It's a place where you can go with everyone and find something for each taste. LOVE this place !!!!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot BC the bf likes vegetables/salads. This place has really fresh ingredients and they're very affordable :) Whats great is that you can customize your order any way you like! And they have so many healthy options! 

Service is always friendly, but can be hit or miss because the likelihood they will mess up your order is almost 50%....haha. But they are very nice about remaking food if they got something wrong.

I love breakfast foods so my fave go-to is the tomato mozzarella frittata (which comes with this amazing watermelon salad!!!)

Be wary of all the gym rats that frequent this place....G&P's are very conveniently located next to a LVAC gym, and you can definitely tell they attract that clientele ;) This particular location is is probably my fave (been to the one on Flamingo which isn't as warm or bright) and while neon green isn't my favorite color, the restaurant is overall very clean and modern."}
{"text":"First time at this place. I had the green ginger juice which was amazing and the trip-tip tacos. The portion was huge and maybe a little too much meat on each taco. At first I wished the meat had a sauce because it was a little dry but then I was glad it didn't because the taco would have surely fallen apart and been much more difficult to eat. The greens and dressing on top are what made that taco."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3x's a week. Enough to see the pros and cons. I've also been to the Rainbow location to compare the difference between the two. I always get my usual and there is a difference in consistency between the two. Both places are good overall but the one thing that stands out between them is the customer service.

 I love their turkey chili but every bite has a 1:10 ratio of turkey and beans. I felt like the beans was the main course. Please change your recipe to add more turkey! I know it sounds a bit silly to make such a request but who would want to eat a spoon full of beans when the name is called turkey chili. 

The batch they make is already pre-made. Everytime I've asked for light on the beans at the Rainbow location they made the effort to make me a batch of where they hand scoop out the extra beans for me for no extra charge. I tipped well as a thank you. It was amazing and I was very happy. It still looked and tasted like their original. (This location is next to my corporate office. I'm assuming they have better customer service to please the business professionals.)

This Eastern location, the chef didn't even care to try. They said they would have to charge me for an extra turkey patty. I basically had to pay $7.00 for a chopped up hamburger patty that's thrown on top of my chili. Not even mixed in for me. *image attached* It looked lazy. I had to bring it back and let them know I paid basically $14.50 for half a cup of chili with a patty thrown on top. I had to ask for a second cup of at least a bit of extra chili since I did paid in full for it.

Little situations like these are the details that makes a business good to great."}
{"text":"Although with the same delicious healthy food, this location's service is beyond subpar, standing in queue for more than 10 mins without staff acknowledging your presence.  Not a \"welcome\" nor \"I'll be right with you\". Meanwhile the only server/cashier/runner runs around catering to all other dine in guests with other queuing guests looking at each other like \"should I say something?\"...   after the previously o it server/cashier/runner serviced all the queuing guests 2 other staff emerge from back of house to say hello to guests... seems to me the location is lacking management... great food however, don't think I'll dine here"}
{"text":"Love this place, i had the ostrich burger OMG it was great having it well done it was still moist and tender. Tofu fries are becoming my favorite.. My friend MMA fighter Kyra had the Chicken satay-6 great size chicken skewers. 

Great decor and look. The owner was dressed nice and served our food and was very welcoming. Def. going back to this spot in vegas!"}
{"text":"So this restaurant is very close to my house so it makes it convenient to come here. The service is alright i suppose.. not like they go out of their way to make you happy or anything. Although they do bring it out to you pretty fast. 

So the last time I was there I ordered the salad with berries in it.. along with some grilled shrimp on top. it was very tasty!! would definitely order again! 
I also ordered the grilled chicken tacos.. presentation wise it was pretty and was quite tasty as well. 
The other times Ive been there Ive ordered a lot of their juices and smoothies and they are all so good!! 

overall i would recommend this place to others that want a healthy place to go to.. its delicious and fast!"}
{"text":"This place was great! DANIEL helped us out. I've never been here before and got a chicken wrap I wasn't too fond of and I'm not the type to send anything back because I am just really  picky . But Dan reassured me that it's ok and got me the bison burger which was delicious !  Customer service and staff is great here! Very friendly and clean!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I got the southwestern tofu and soy chorizo burrito with avocado and a wheat wrap. It was sooo much better than I expected and was very filling. I tried the stubborn soda (acai and lemon flavor) and was NOT satisfied. It was literally just sparkling water. However, I did try the vanilla cream and it was much better!! The guy who handed me my food also went across the place to get me a fork which was really nice. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful, good environment. Got the albacore tuna salad and wellness juice. Wellness juice was great and very tasty. Albacore tuna salad was not good--I thought it would be slices of fresh tuna on top of a salad since it cost $10, but instead it was a lump of canned tuna with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, and butter lettuce. My wife got a barbecue chicken pizza, and that the chicken wasn't quite good quality either."}
{"text":"I really like this chain, as it's easy to eat as healthy or as \"healthy\" as you'd like. You can't go wrong with their wraps and sandwiches, as you can have it in a spinach or even a steamed cabbage wrap! They give plenty of meat as well, ensuring that you are well satisfied. The only thing I don't really recommend are the ahi tuna tacos--the flavor is there, but the weird mango salsa they put on it is really sweet and slightly out of place with the mellow avocado. It might be better to make a tangy or spicy sauce to mellow out the avocado, and a ceviche-esque dish is never a bad thing. Anyway, everything else is yummy so give it a try!"}
{"text":"Plastic is a great material, but I would rather not have it in my smoothie. 
While visiting this location yesterday, I purchased a berry smoothie for my five year old and a Green Ginger Limeade smoothie for myself. 

While drinking my smoothie I felt an odd texture in my mouth, thinking it was a piece of a hard leaf of some sort , I chewed it only to find that it did not break up into smaller pieces as expected. When I pulled it out of my mouth it was a small piece of plastic that was the equivalent of laying 3 grains of rice end to end. I showed it to the very kind young lady who rang me up earlier and she said she was sorry and that she would share my finding with the manager. 

Thinking that this was just a fluke, I continued to sip my drink, only to find another piece of plastic about one fourth the size of the first. I went to the counter and asked to speak with a manager. The woman I was addressing informed me that she was the manager. I then explained that this was the second piece of plastic I had sucked through my straw. And she said that the night before, she had seen a piece of plastic in the grapes while they were removing the grapes from their packaging. She made a circle with her hand to show me the approximate size of said plastic piece,(approximately the size of a quarter), then went on to state that since it was clear, that made it very difficult to sort out of the grapes. 

I have visited this location in the past and had no issues. The employees and the manager were very pleasant and friendly during this visit. My problem is with the fact that the manager stated that she saw the plastic in the grapes, yet she did not take the time to stop the process of cleaning them in order to fish out the piece of plastic.  I can only think about the many health conscious patrons who come here expecting to have a healthy treat as I did.  In fact, her own baby ( that looked to be approximately 4 to 5 months old) was enjoying a smoothie and I just hate to think that someone else's child could have choked on that piece of plastic. 

In the future, I would suggest fishing the plastic out and training the employees to also keep a watchful eye for things that should not be present among the fruits and vegetables they juice. This whole thing could have been avoided by a very simple precaution."}
{"text":"We came here so my fiancé could try ostrich but sadly they were out. So we ordered a wellness juice which is pretty good, he ordered a angus burger and I order a grilled veggie wrap ( because I'm vegetarian) and they gave me a grilled chicken wrap?? What? Chicken doesn't sound like veggie... And the jicama \"fries\" are raw and taste like dirt. Additionally the cashier was kinda snotty to us. Seeing as it's our first time and we got some crappy service and a wrong order they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple of days ago for the first time. And LOVED it! They have the best turkey chili in town. Fast service and friendly employees!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Greens and Proteins, I am definitely excited to not have to go up to Summerlin to get my fix. 

The food is good, never a problem with that. Parking is pretty easy, haven't had a hard time finding a spot. Service is good, employees are friendly. It can be pretty speedy, but when it is busier it can take a while for your order. I typically call in and pick up, that's usually the quickest. The restaurant is clean and there is plenty of tables. 

Everything on the menu is yummy, be adventurous and try something new!"}
{"text":"My friend had been wanting to check out Greens and Protein, so I decided to join in for dinner. 

The place is cute and very modern with a green and fresh-looking atmosphere. I opted for the bison burger with tofu fries. The food arrived quickly and it didn't do much for me visually. The burger was cooked decently, but the flavors were lacking. Everything was a little bland. I love tofu, but the fries were rubbery and the jicama fries I tried from my friend's plate were ok. I usually like jicama a lot, but these were overly vinegary and not what I was hoping for when I bit in. Most others seemed to agree since most people were dumping a majority of their fries in the trash that I saw. 

The burger was solid, but nothing else really hit home for me. I appreciate the \"healthy\" food they seem to pride themselves in here, but I'd have to try more to see if there's anything that really hits the spot for me."}
{"text":"great food!!! cool price an the employees are very  nice employees are always eager to please the customers makes you happy to be a regular customer!!!!!! thanks kayla & lizette and the big boss man cesar"}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessed with  this place, have been here at least twice a week! I love the cucumber water they have for free, it's very refreshing and tasty. I've been getting the build your own meal, with ahi tuna, avocado and balsamic it's to die for. I'm planning on trying one of the smoothies these days, they look delish. Employees are also very friendly."}
{"text":"I started going to protein house just because it's more visible when I leave the gym. Last couple times I about barfed. Their food has no flavor.  I always forget greens and proteins is just down the road. Healthy food with flavor!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is like my second kitchen. I love everything on the menu, especially the French toast. They make it easy to maintain a healthy diet for a person who's constantly on the go. Plus they are more then happy to adjust your order to your specific diet needs. I'm a ovo vegetarian and asking for a substitute of eggs in a wrap or burger instead of the meat is never an issue."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to eat when I'm in Vegas. I love the healthy choices and what a variety there is! If you're in the mood for Acai bowls, French toast, pizza, burgers or salad this place has it all. It also has juices. The free cucumber water is delicious too. The options are many and the healthful benefits are great too. There are many gluten free options and organic choices. I never thought eating so healthy could taste so good! I love this place more than Swamis in California where I live."}
{"text":"Came here the other day and was instantly reminded of why I love it so much. The atmosphere is fun and comfy...regardless of how busy it gets, the vibe is always amazing! My go-to item on the menu is the veggie pizza, with vegan cheese and gluten free crust. It never disappoints and is far better tasting than a lot of greasy, fatty pizzas I've tried. Healthy and tasty, I'd say that's a win win! I will continue to return every time I get the urge to indulge in pizza, simply because I won't have to suffer the guilt, or bloat. Not to mention, everything else on the menu is awesome...salads, smoothies, juice, and so forth. Whatever it is, you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"It was me and my husband's first time here and we decided to try it because we just left the gym and wanted to try something new and healthy. This place popped up and was the only place not closing within 30 minutes. The place was clean and the guy at the cash register was really helpful when since it was our first time. We got the turkey club wrap with jicima, hummus & pita, and an apple pie smoothie with almond milk. The jicima was surprisingly good and I'm not one to stray from my usual sweet potato fries. The wrap was as expected also we added avocado to that. The hummus came in two different colors which I'm not used to seeing orange hummus, but it was still good. The apple pie smoothie did taste like apple but for me it was kind of weird drinking that flavor. Overall, I gave this place 4 stars because of the cleanliness, friendly staff, and good food."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 days ago.  Ordered the bison cheesesteak, ate 3/4 of it, and found the most disgusting black curly piece of hair imbedded in my meat.  Couldn't submit my review until now since it still makes me want to vomit just writing about it."}
