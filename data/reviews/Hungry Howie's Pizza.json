{"text":"I just had the pleasure of watching a Hungry Howie's driver throw his trash out of his car window into my yard. When I asked him to pick it up, I got a F you and he drove off. Thanks Hungry Howie's. You suck."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. Especially at 2am. But when it takes over an hour for delivery, no thank you. I shouldn't have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is. Then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip. That's the best way to not get a tip."}
{"text":"Every time I check yelp for their hours I show up and they are closed. Today the sign was on door open and employees were sitting behind the counter eating and talking then tell me that they are closed despite yelp and their sign saying they were open. Doubt I'll be coming back for this horrible service.

Update
Came to In and Out on camelback & 101 received great service. Next time come here first."}
{"text":"of course this isn't a fine eating establishment - it's the normal type of greasy pizza style food you'd expect next to the largest university in the country. with that being said, i employed my $5 pizza here, and feel that the price weighed against the taste and service makes it worth every penny."}
{"text":"Still amazing. One of the best chains around. I like the steak Howie roll. It's an eat with your hands on the go type of meal."}
{"text":"usually pretty good service. this was a bad case of customer service. got a call
when it was delivered. missed it due to bad cell service in the room. based on phone records, i called back 2 minutes later. was told he had already left and wouldn't be back for an hour. this was not good customer service, I live in an apartment building and I could have been waiting for an elevator to go down to get the pizza and they driver would have already driven away. while trying to talk to someone about the issue, I kept being redirected assuming i was going to talk to someone. each time i was redirected it went back to the beginning of someone saying \"hungry howies, pick up or delivery?\" and had to reexplain my story. this was 4 times. manager was rude abd inconsiderate and not aware of what good customer service is. will tell friends to not order."}
{"text":"The only way to do it :

If you call in, make sure you are picking it up. Delivery is tricky with this place.

If you call in, make them repeat your order. Because they may give you something else boxed up and it may be too late when you realize.

When you pick up, open the box and check on the pizza.

the 5$ pizzas are the only things out there that is worth the money. Cajun crust, pineapple and jalapeno - my favourites."}
{"text":"When I called to place my order, I told the order taker that I had a coupon (that was sent to us by the store) for a Large 2-Topping Pizza for $6.99.  When he asked me what toppings I wanted, I told him Chicken and Feta cheese.  When asked about the \"Free Flavored Crust\", I told him I wanted Asiago.  That was the extent of the conversation.  When we received the pizza and looked over the bill, we were very surprised to find that our $6.99 pizza actually cost $10.19 and our \"FREE CRUST\" cost $1.00.  When I called the restaurant to inquire about the discrepancy, I was told that Feta cheese didn't qualify as a topping (\"it is a cheese\" was what the person said).  Also, Asiago is the only crust that isn't free (although the brochure they sent lists it as a \"FREE FLAVORED CRUST.\")  Let me be clear - at no point during the ordering process was any of this VITAL information disclosed to me.  The guy that answered the phone the second time was useless and refused to help me or give me the name of the District Manager.  I wrote to corporate (using their contact form) and my e-mail was ignored.  Clearly, based on the number of complaints on Yelp, they have their hands full. There are much better pizza places in Tempe - I suggest finding another."}
{"text":"OK, I have to downgrade by at least one star.  My husband ordered pizza last night and forgot to order it with the seasoned crust.  Big mistake!  The seasoned crust is what MAKES the pizza here.  Without it, it's just a completely flavorless pizza - even with the 3 meat toppings that we had (ham, sausage and pepperoni.)  If I were to rate this restaurant based on this unseasoned pizza alone, I would give it 1 star.  However, because I have had the seasoned crust variety on a couple of occasions, and enjoyed it, I'll stick with an overall rating of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Lousy, cheap pizza is a North American staple and they've got it. If you order to your tastes, it's a great deal and not half bad. Just don't get anything but pizza. I made the mistake of ordering breadsticks and wings. The breadsticks made the muscles in my jaw hurt. The boneless wings are chicken nuggets with a bit of watered-down sauce squirted over them and it's not worth the price. Given my experience, I certainly wont be trying the other items on the menu but I will continue to order cheap pizza from them."}
{"text":"Love the flavored crust! On that note, that's about all to love besides the pretty cheap prices. On my first visit, I called ahead for pick up, and when I arrived I still had to wait an extra 10 minutes or so. This was around 5pm so I guess its a busy time on a Saturday. Being that its a new location I'm hoping their quality and service will get better over time."}
{"text":"Cold, slow, overpriced dont waste your $$ ordered online for a 6pm delivery, 6:25 it finally arrived my 2 year old was able to bite into it immediately if we need a temperature description. Got two medium pizzas and 10 wings. Wings weren't bad but $30 down the drain pizza in the trash"}
{"text":"Good pie, good crust. I take it over any other 'fast food' chain.  I wouldn't try to order a custom topping pizza from here.. had mine messed up.."}
{"text":"They have redeemed themselves! Better service this time! Great pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Medina Hungry Howie's location for several years now and have always had good service and good pizza (and subs).  Have never had anything delivered so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Best pizza! Yummiest calzones!! Get the wings well done so good! 
The best part is also their flavored crust butter cheese and ranch! 
Also try the sub sauce for calzones!"}
{"text":"As a Concierge, it's my job to present exactly what Hungry Howie's did which was present solutions, only they delivered them. The hotel & valet staff was overwhelmed with no way of us being able to get offsite, and team moral was lacking. I called in and asked for the manager to see if they could make a delivery to the casino, and they did just that after I explained to management I couldn't for whatever reason get delivery service from other venues.

From call to crust Hungry Howie's sealed the deal with a mouthwatering garlic herb crust, and the rest of the pizzas we ordered. I personally had never had the pizza, but would highly recommend to guests or anyone in the mood for pizza, and if you're in need of delivery due to being out town.

The crust, sauce, and toppings come with an abundance of flavor, and the team was able to revitalize and finish there shift without any disturbances, or hunger for that matter. :) The staff was prompt, friendly, and the delivery was not a minute late.

Thanks Hungry Howie's!
You came through when others had no clue what to do.

{"text":"Called and was told it would take 20 minutes to pick up one sub, so I ordered it only to walk in 25 minutes later and was told they never put the order in. Which was ok because I could see the cook in the kitchen not wearing gloves. 
No wonder there were NO customers to be found. Horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in to pick up a pizza tonight shortly before 8PM, and waited for a minute or two as the family in front of me finished their order. The cashier ran to the back to begin preparing pizzas, and said nothing to me. I then waited for TEN MINUTES at the register, while at least 5 people were preparing food or doing other tasks behind the counter. At least half of them made eye contact with me. Not one said a word this entire time. Finally another person walked in the store, and only then did someone come to the front - to ask HIM if he had been helped yet.

When I said that I hadn't been helped yet and I had been waiting ten minutes, I'm sure I sounded frustrated but I did not yell or get angry. Thirty seconds later I finally had the pizza, but not once was I offered an apology for the wait. 

I would have been completely fine with the wait if just one person would have acknowledged me while I stood there for ten minutes. I even would have been okay if someone said \"sorry for your wait\" when I finally got the pizza. But to be completely ignored for that long and then not offered even a \"Sorry\" is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"So I'm pretty sure this is the one we went to on E Baseline... Anyways it was sooo good and Robert.D the man who took our order was amazing!
 along side the men who made our pizzas! They are great I'm surprised by the other reviews. We ordered over the phone and they had it ready by the time we got there. and it was perfect considering we need things done in a timely manor with 2 kids in the car. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Umm well for starters I ordered a thin crust medium sized pizza, the toppings were underneath the cheese and the crust was like eating baked pita bread. I didnt enjoy this pizza one bit. The flavor wasn't as good as i anticipated. It was very runny. The cheese would seperate from the pizza as i grabbed my slice. I got through two slices and had to stop eating it. The only thing I enjoyed were their wings, and my bottle of pepsi."}
{"text":"I placed and order and called to confirm because I didn't get an email. The employees were rude and hung up on me each time I called. I called once to confirm the order because it was taking too long  and was given a script on how their orders have a 45 minute to an hour delay and was immediately hung up on after. I called again and was hung up on. The third time I called, I asked for a refund. They couldn't give me a confirmation for my refund and I got hung up on after I explained that I didn't appreciate the way I was being treated.  They were completely disrespectful."}
{"text":"Stupid idiots are running this crappy excuse for a pizza joint. Waited for 12 minutes for anyone to take my order, smile and acknowledge I've walked in...nope!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza over 90 minutes ago and they don't know what has happened they blame it on computer but over 60 till there computer received order then another 30 for driver to drive 2 miles"}
{"text":"This place flat out sucks! Service is the worst. Staff of kids are totally out of control. And really, 10 cents a pack for cheese or peppers! I'm done. Just spent my last dollar there. Time to go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Love the calzones. If you get pizza, the garlic flavored crust is the bomb! Super cheap! Ask for thier specials."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good. Definitely better than the average pizza. I really like the fact that you can choose different flavors of crust. The wings are decent, nothing special but they are tasty."}
{"text":"Do not I repeat Do not eat at this Hungry Howies. Me and my brother ate here and we were throwing up for two days. We couldn't hold anything on our stomach. Beware of their specials. I think when they have these, it's an attempt to get rid of old products/ingredients, thus causing a person to get sick"}
{"text":"Love the pizza...Love the deals...Don't love the wait. Mid-day on a Thursday, the place was completely dead and it still took them 45 minutes to make my one pizza. The employees are very kind, but move waaaayyy too slow."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I only ever get the $5 one topping large pizza.  Its CHEAP and I love the pizza. Its no Papa Johns but its a lot cheaper.

There are a few bad things. The people that work there all seem suicidal. The guy at the checkout is never friendly and they have a sign saying free smile with every pizza. I have never received my free smile. I dont mind because of the price. 

If you deliver, it kind of sucks. For 3 pizzas it ends up around $24 vs the $16 pickup."}
{"text":"Very accommodating Hungry Howie's. I ordered online with an over $12 order to get a free medium pizza but it didn't come off the bill. When I picked up my order I let them know about it and they immediately refunded my medium pizza. The staff was very curious and helpful and of course, the pizza was delicious as always!"}
{"text":"The worst ! The manger is not respectful , I think he need to go back to middle school cuz his mind still did not grow up ."}
{"text":"Good pizza but the delivery time is ridiculous. Ordered pizza an hour and 20 minutes ago and still has not arrived after we were told it would be here in 40 minutes. There are way better pizza places that can arrive at a decent time."}
{"text":"I really like Hungry Howies Pizza so I continue to buy food from there.  Here's the catch.  Don't use the internet because they won't even pay attention to the order (I know this because it happened to me) and don't deliver because it will take at least and hour and a half (twice happened to me). So basically order over the phone and go and pick it up."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst pizza place I have been to, I called on the phone and placed an order for a regular large pepperoni pizza. The man on the phone was very polite and said okay 20 mins and it will be done. I got their right on time if that I made another stop leading to were my pizza should be well over done now and waiting for me. I get their and pay, then he went to go see if it's ready and he says no not yet maybe 10-15 mins. Are you kidding? Then he goes on and complain about short staff, like woah wait! I'm not your boss, not your friend, not your co worker! I'm a customer not wanting excuses so I ask if I can speak to a manager then he tells me I am the manager (his name was Anthony) & I say okay I'm just going to let you know that I will no longer support Hungry Howies, this was my first and last visit and your problems are not my problems. But as I was talking he was throwing his hands up at me, not listening, telling me to go ahead and leave I already had my pizza. So rude and unprofessional!"}
{"text":"It's chain pizza, but it's GOOD.  They offer a variety of flavored crusts, and they really are flavorful.  Their Howie Bread is pretty similar to Domino's breadsticks (which aren't the greatest), but the flavors make them a lot better.  And it's CHEAP."}
{"text":"I originally had a wonderful review, the pizza is always great and I love the boneless wings however the last three times my order has taken over an hour and a half to be delivered to us. This last time was the worst. I called two times to check the status of our food only to be informed it was on it's way, mean while we live less than 10min away. Our last order showed up 2 HOURS after we ordered it, it was also smashed and the driver did not have a copy of the receipt to be signed so he had me sign a piece of paper. I was not offered anything in return or an apology and now get to enjoy cold smashed food."}
{"text":"This is the worst hungry howies or any pizza place I have ever dealt with. Ordered online and they lost the order or never got it or whatever their issue was. I called to find out where the pizza was and I was told by the manager it wasn't his problem and to call corporate. They took my $30 and that was ok but to get my food it wasn't their problem and I should call corporate. This from their so called manager. He should be fired. Will never deal with them again and suggest no one else does either. Unprofessional and rude. And now no food and no money. They don't even deserve the one star but it wouldn't let me post without at least that. Boo hungry howies"}
{"text":"It's my Favorite late night take-out pizza place in Tempe. I always get my pizza hot, fresh, and at good price. I've always used the app to order, never called in, seems faster."}
{"text":"When I was in college I loved this spot and I just recently came back NYC for a long awaited visit to Hungry Howies and to show my east coast buddies whats up.  Not only did I receive the wrong order (I got half Jalapeno/half onion pizza instead of bacon and onions), but this was easily the worst pizza I have EVER eaten.  I drove all the way from Gilbert cause this was the only location open late night, and my night was pretty shot after opening the pizza.  Thanks a lot Howies..."}
{"text":"OK pizza for the price. but sometimes they just dont anwser the phone, at 10pm on a friday when they are suppose to be open till midnight?"}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service.  I placed my order online.  Fifteen minutes after I placed my order, someone called me to tell me that I wasn't going to be able to get my full order, due to the fact they don't have wings...  Okay, so then I was told my medium one topping pizza would take 45 minutes to be delivered.  One hour later I called the location back and inquired about the location of my pizza.  The \"manager\" Andrew told me that the delivery guy had \"just left\" and he would be at my house at any minute, BUT, he would call him to confirm that he was almost at my house.  Fifteen minutes later, no phone call back, no pizza, so I call again.  The \"manager\" tells me that he can't believe that the delivery guy isn't there, and then he admits to me that he never called the delivery guy, because he \"can't find his phone number\"...  I hang up.  Wait another fifteen minutes.  At this point, I ordered my pizza 1.5 hours ago.  I call back AGAIN.  The \"manager\" Andrew tells me that the \"delivery guy\" Bobby actually brought my pizza back to the store TEN MINUTES AGO because he couldn't find my house...  I asked why I NEVER got a phone call from Bobby and was THEN told that it was because his phone died.......................  The manager then proceeded to tell me that he doesn't know HIS supervisor's name or phone number, and that he also is unable to credit me back the money that I paid for my pizza...  Andrew tells me that I need to contact Hungry Howie's corporate to get my money back for the food that WAS NEVER DELIVERED TO ME...  I am completely BLOWN AWAY that this franchise is even permitted to be operating.  ***WARNING***  DO NOT EVER ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION..."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza an hour ago..
Still not here. For expensive pizza, could you at least warn your customers about the wait? I expected a 40 minute wait. If it's not here soon I'm just going to call and cancel."}
{"text":"So the service sucked. You do not receive what you ask for. Do not eat here and the person taking my order should not have a job"}
{"text":"Food was good as expected, but the experience was ruined when my wife received a text message from the driver about 45 min after the delivery making sexual advances toward her. If he is bold enough to use customers private information in this way, then I can only imagine what else he could be doing. It was completely inappropriate, and I will be following up with management soon. Hopefully they will hold their employees accountable."}
{"text":"This is just your average pizza place. Not much for seating it's basically carry out or delivery only. It's semi quick, definitely just a college kids late night pizza place"}
{"text":"Ok I ordered my food and I had a promo code for free delivery. They were quick to charge my card then 5 minutes call me back and tell me the code can't be honored and want to charge me 3 more dollars to continue my order. No thanks how about before u charge my card how about calling me first before taking my money now I have to wait 3 to 5 days just to get my money back and stuck with no lunch. Thank you for ruining my appetite I will never go to another hungry Howies again and ever would I recommend it to anyone either. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order like I had for the last 10 years at least once or twice a month. The associate, who did not identify his name when I called, told me I did not meet the minimum order amount. I asked him to look at my history as a loyal customer who had ordered there over 100 times to make an expection as had been made before. (By the way this is at 10:30 in the morning so I know they were not busy.) I told him I would hold for a manager. His response was \"I'm the manager\". I asked him if he was going to delivery to me without ordering more food and he said no."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for delivery wich was fast. Friendly driver. Great pizza well balanced ingredients and great quality of cheese which I believe to be more than one. Thanks!

Several months later........
            I order from here more often than anywhere else. Its usually good pizza, flavored crust, there side orders are even better. They arrive on time 90% of the time the other 10% I expect them to be late due to the time period I order. I would give 5 stars but if you order an extra tub of sauce sometimes they get it wrong and once my 2 liter was warm because it was 115 degrees outside."}
{"text":"\"I was having fun playing in the snow and you ruined it like a pizza place ruins a salad!\" -Stewie Griffin

I had a Greek Salad here that, for the first time in my life, disproved this Family Guy reference. The greens were fairly fresh and there were beets in the salad. BEETS! Never have I felt more accomplished in ordering from a pizza place, simply because I managed to have about four bites of something healthy. 

Howie's works a strong side game if you're looking to order something besides a pizza. You can't go wrong with their calzone, pepperoni roll, cheesy bread, or boneless wings. 

And yeah, they're pizza's damn good. Just don't forget to get a flavored crust, it's the whole point of ordering from here!"}
{"text":"Taste is good, but hurts my stomach hurts after 30 minutes of eating. They must use the cheapest products available.  Makes sense its only five bucks. Spend a bit more and get a frozen pizza :)"}
{"text":"First off the medium pizza is NOT a medium. My fault for not checking the size, but still pretty upset about the tiny pizza I received. Maybe I wouldn't have minded so much if the food had been decent, but this was literally the worst pizza I have ever had, cheap microwave pizzas included. They completely skimped on the toppings. I ordered a three topping pizza and there was all of ten pieces of mushroom and barely any pepperoni and olives. All toppings were just thrown on the center of the pizza  leaving half of every slice naked save for tasteless cheese and sauce. They took forever to deliver and the pizza arrived cold and stale. The flavored crust is NOT anything to rave about, I got the garlic herb and it was just not good and this comes from a person who loves garlic everything. The hot wings were definitely not hot, temperature and spicy flavor wise. The blue cheese dip was disgusting and the texture alone was enough to make me nauseous. The service is crappy and the pizza and wings are crappy and I really highly recommend ordering from another pizza place."}
{"text":"We ordered from here last night and the pizza was mediocre. It was not cut all the way and we had to cut it ourselves. The Howie bread is either too greasy or has nothing on it. We ordered hot wings which showed up with no sauce. I'm not expecting gourmet but that my pizza is at least cut."}
{"text":"We ate here our first night in Charlotte! It was delivered quickly, still hot, and fresh!! I got the Everything Bagel crust, not impressed, very very salty! I did like the Cajun bread sticks! Excited to try different crust types!!"}
{"text":"Love their food however terrible delivery service - took over an hour and a half. Note expected delivery time when ordered was an hour, they are located about 2 miles from the house and it was 11:30 on a Sunday."}
{"text":"So friday my husband orders pizza. It was 430pm. Told them it was cash they said it was going to be about 45 min. Its Sunday and still havent recieved it. We called got hung up on and called again and no one answered. So we called good o'l dominos to the rescue. We had Howies pizza once before and decided to try it again. I couldnt make this up if i tried."}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered a pepperoni pizza from this location and we both got very sick from eating their pizza. My boyfriend even had to take a day off from work because he was still feeling sick. When I called the next day to complain the lady that I spoke to wad very rude and very unprofessional. She was making excuses and blaming us. They took no responsibility for getting us sick and after I spoke to someone at corporate I was told the owner of this location would contact me and I'm still waiting for them to call me. I will never go back to this location ever again or any other location ever again. The customer service is terrible and they are very rude! Don't eat here!"}

{"text":"This place is the noise! Always super friendly and hands down the best Howies in my area. So much so in fact that I have them in my favorites because I call so often. I special order from here literally EVERY order! They are always happy to do it.

It's not the closest howies to me but it's the best. Keep doin' that crazy thing you do raycooper howies. 

your's forever,

{"text":"Sigh~Why am I even writing this!  Shouldn't I be writing about all the best pizza in town like Pizzeria Bianco, Grazie Pizzeria, Sauce, etc?  Eh, I'm in a bad mood anyway so I might as well do something de-structive.

The con-struction guys working on the floor ordered Howie's pizza by accident two days in a row because of a coupon.  Howie's took forever to deliver but it all worked out because by the time we got the pizza we were so HUNGRY that were ready to eat dried out, tepid, rubbery pizza.  

oooh I feel so evil writing this and sad for Howie but it was truly an unsatisfying experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them another chance and I was sorely disappointed. Our food took well over 3 hours to arrive after 2 phone calls and at least one forgotten delivery. When we called the staff was not only unhelpful but dismissive and didn't even refund our meal. They blamed the mishap on it being 420 and everyone ordering pizza. Not the best guys. 

You definitely left us hungry, Howie. We won't be calling you again."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's has been our \"go-to\" pizza place. You can't do better than $5 Pep-Butter Cheese. Great value, great pizza. Haven't really had the need to try anything else."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good, and if you go on Wednesdays, they have thier Wacky Wedneday special, Large 1-topping for 5.99.  Free Flavored crust and usually quick service.  The employee even offered us free drinks while we waited in the dining room."}
{"text":"Ordered two large pizzas online. When I showed to pick it up, they said they hadn't received my order. Once we got it sorted out they quickly made my order and threw in a free cinnamon bread. Excellent customer service! The pizza is great, and the flavored crusts are what keep us coming back."}
{"text":"We use to love Hungry Howie's 5 years ago before we moved. So when we moved back to the area we were so excited to eat them again! We ordered two of their special pizza's  1) was philly cheesestake and the other was a meats eater. Wow these things were awful! I am not even sure if the word awful is strong enough to describe how bad these were. It was like eating cardboard and the toppings... What toppings.. I swear maybe 2 pieces of meat less than the size of a nickel on there. The toppings seemed old and overcooked the few that could be found.. So unfortunately something we were looking forward to has gone so far down hill we will never give them another chance to redeem themselves and will just have to find someplace else to satisfy our pizza cravings.. It was the worse 30 bucks we have ever spent."}
{"text":"Not bad for deliverable Little Caesars. Toppings are good, and crust seasonings help. Howie breadsticks are yummy. My problem is, the eadibleness the day after; ew. The next day the leftovers were rocks. Amazing pricing!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Hungry Howies without problem but this one is by far the worst restaurant customer service I have ever encountered. We ordered online and after 1 hour and 30 minutes I call them and they said they came twice, knocked on the door and called my phone with no answer. I was home the entire time and my phone didn't ring once, and there was no voicemails for that matter. I was transferred to a manager who wouldn't let me explain to him that I indeed was home the entire time and didn't hear a single knock and he kept interrupting me, so quick to defend his staff. No apology. He then said the pizza was still sitting there in their restaurant and they would send it on the next truck out. At this point my food would be cold and who knows when the next delivery would go out. So I called back to cancel and explained that I would rather not pay money for cold pizza and terrible customer service and they said Ok AND HUNG UP. No apology. Didn't try to accommodate me at all. At least I was planning on paying in cash so no refund to dispute. 

They obviously don't care about the happiness of their customers and I refuse to give them my business ever again."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if this app allowed me to do so. Very very poor customer service. 2 hours later, 4 phone calls they still don't have the order correct or delivered... totally ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have to give it up to Hungry Howies, they are definitely a step up from that Pizza! Pizza! place :-P The prices are fairly reasonable & they have deals all the time. The pizza here is pretty greasy, but not any worse than any other pizza joint. They are definitely nice & cheesy, which I love...a lot! They also have 8 flavored crusts to choose from; original, butter, cajun, butter cheese, sesame, ranch, garlic herb, and onion. My personal fave is garlic herb. They also have the other usual suspects, breadsticks, cinna-bread, wings, subs & salads. I can't really opine on any of those, other than the cinna-bread. Not really something I would order again. But, you an judge for yourself. Also, no matter what size you order, all pizzas are sliced into 8 slices. Oh & one major downfall, IMO is that they serve that inferior cola product that has always been & will probably always be 2nd to Coke ;-)"}
{"text":"Everytime we order it is wrong. This time we called to complain and we were told after a   10 min discussion and much frustration, that they would fix it THIS time. Well this will be the last time we order from them as well!
0 star would be more appropriate !"}
{"text":"I have to say i LOVE the pizza but was Very disapointed in the \"boneless wings\" aka Chicken nuggets that you dip in bbq sauce... Now on the other hand the traditional bone-in wings were awesome and I usually dont like them... the price is great $5 for a lg one topping and get to choose your flavorof crust!!! YUMMMMMO"}
{"text":"I called to place an order for pickup on July 3, 2016. My child has a dairy allergy and whenever we get pizza, we always order a separate pizza for him without cheese.  Apparently this just isn't possible at Hungry Howies!  The young man on the phone put me on hold only to come back on the line to tell me he doesn't have a button for that on the computer.  I asked him if he could just tell the person making it not to put cheese on it.  I suppose that was just out of the question because the answer I kept getting was \"The computer doesn't allow me to do that\".   Wow.  I was completely shocked that a simple request couldn't be done because computers run this business leaving ZERO room for actual customer service.  Needless to say, I cancelled my entire order and went to Barro's where they gladly put the order through without a problem."}

But unfortunately I live in concord and there's not a hungry HOWIES in concord so I have to order take at hungry HOWIES every time I go to charlotte for work! I love the crust and the pizza just blows my mind and the prices are unbelievable! I always order online it's fast and they are speedy Gonzales when it comes to making a pizza! They are better then little Ceasers and now Pizza Hut! I wish they would build one in concord one day :) Thank you for the awesome pizza and I love the name it's cute!"}
{"text":"Well it was a nice thought.lol. I ordered take out on 5-18-14 at about 7:43pm. Was told my food would be ready at 8:00 which is when I arrived. After waiting until 8:10 the clueless teenagers realized that a delivery guy took a bunch of wrong pizzas to deliver to some surprising customers Im sure, which were my pizzas and wings. Needless to say the dumb and dumbers had to remake my food and was ready at 8:27. FTP!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza!! I get the garlic herb crust and it is amazing,  their philly cheese steak pizza is also really good!  I love this place and will only buy pizza from here when I am getting it delivered!"}
{"text":"On the same level as dominos. Nothing special. You're going here bc it's cheap not because you expect good pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! We ordered the Philly cheese steak specialty pizza with the garlic herb crust and a ham& jalapeno with the butter cheese crust."}
{"text":"Be careful when ordering online I tried to order online when they were still open(at 9:30pm), the online site said that they were closed, I called they clearly stated that they weren't and they've been having a lot of issues with the online ordering lately so I asked the guy if I can go ahead and order over the phone, he replied yes, they had a coupon for buy one specialty pizza get one one topping pizza for 19.99, I asked if I was able to still use that coupon on the website since my whole intention was to order online anyways, he tells me that he cannot accommodate me knowing that the website has trouble. Good customer service always goes a long way but this guy was terrible, like it was my fault that the website was giving ME trouble."}
{"text":"There's only one word to describe my experience this evening at this Hungry Howie's location, incompetent. We decided to give Hungry Howies a second chance after last week, when it took over 2 hours to be delivered and was cold by the time it got here. They were courteous enough to offer us a replacement order at any time, so we took them up on the offer this evening.

Unfortunately, when I placed the order on the phone, the woman that I spoke with could not find my account after about 5 minutes, miraculously she determined that it was there and was able to accept the order. I clearly stated to her that I would pay for the delivery charge even though the pizzas were free. She said it would be delivered in approximately 45 minutes. Great news! Or so I thought.  After an hour and 20 minutes my wife asked me, where's my pizza? It has still not arrived so I decided to call and speak with the same person who I place the order with. She stated \"There was no way for you to pay for only the delivery in our system\" and that it's been waiting here for pick up.  So I decided to pick up the pizza myself since obviously they couldn't figure out how to drive 8 blocks away. When I arrived at the Hungry Howies location to pick up my pizza they were indeed sitting on the counter ready for pickup. When I got them home, a little overdone as could be unexpected, but when I looked at the deep dish, there was a puddle of mozzarella cheese where it had all melted and pooled into one place almost a half an inch thick.

Most definitely this will be my last visit patronizing this establishment as I love pizza but I also love the service that you pay for.  I can't wait to order Pizza Hut next week. I would recommend that anyone who is considering patronizing this establishment order at least 3 hours in advance and don't expect to get what you order because it is highly unlikely it will arrive in time and if it does it will be cold.

Unfortunately Yelp requires that I give them at least one star, I'm not sure they deserve even that."}
{"text":"BE AWARE OF YOUR CREDIT CARD.
we are regular customers.
Love the pizza.

However, 
   New employee..20 minutes on the phone to order two pizzas.
   We have no paper plates or condiments.  Of course we know thats not true.
    Im new we were told. 
Delivery person got lost.
   Of course receipt said \" bring paper plates etc.
Lo and behold. Credit card company said \" fraudulant alert three similar charges\"
   Yes.  We have an issue.
We called and got Mihaela A. 
   Manager please \" Im the manager\"
 I Explained the issue.
   \"You have to prove it...bring your statement to the store and I cant do anything, that was yesterday\"
????? \" It takes overnight to post and why would I have to come and show you? You can look it up heres the ticket number...etc...
   \"Nope sorry you can talk to the General manager she went on \" 
?  Ok \"can I speak with Him?\"
   \" No, he wont be in until tuesday\"  (its sunday)
\"Does this make sense? \"? I asked.
   \"Thats the way it is
  He will say the same thing sorry., she finished.
Guess who wrote the ticket...Mihaelia A..
   I assume Ill have to refuse all the charges and stick with dominoes and papa johns...too bad..
  One employee can lose a regular customer."}
{"text":"They rather not deliver to African Americans, I ordered food, two different nights in the same week, and they never came. What makes it so bad, is that I was a the super 8 on Sunset, and they're in and out during the night making deliveries."}
{"text":"I have always loved Hungry Howies Pizza, preferrably with a garlic crust. It has been one of my favorite fast food pizza places to order from for years now. The last two times that I have ordered from them has been nothing short of a horrible experience. The first of the last two times, I ordered a pizza and it arrived after 1.5 hours of waiting. Of course the standard is 45 minutes which I expected but I had to call at 1.5 hours to see where my pizza was, they said he was almost to my house. When the pizza arrived it was cold. It wasn't even luke warm. So I had to heat my oven to cook it  a bit longer so it was at a temperature that was edible. I called to complain to the company and all they said was sorry. They didn't offer any compensation or even a coupon for my next visit. The most recent experience was not pleasant either. I ordered a pizza and it arrived within the 45 minutes this time, however, instead of giving me my standard cheese pizza with garlic crust and ranch order... they brought me a thin crust cheese pizza and no ranch. So I drove my butt down to the pizza restaurant after calling them to complain. They replaced my pizza. They again did not bother with any compensation or even a coupon. They didn't even apologize this time. I have been a hungry howies customer for years now and after this service, I refuse to spend any more of my money or time on this business. I will be ordering from anywhere but this restaurant. I am a pizza lover and literally eat it once a week and service where they do not care about their customers is no business I wish to support."}
{"text":"Ordered a Medium Chef's Salad, and 2 small pizzas.
Delivery time was quoted at 55 minutes (really? we are a 5 minute drive away) which seemed long, but actually arrived 1 hour and 15 minutes after ordering.
Salad was old looking and not cold, but room temperature.
Both Pizzas were bland, and cold. Both very light on toppings.
The Included Blue cheese dressing was room temperature at best, which I could not trust to be eatable.
The one pizza we asked to be well done, was actually not as cooked as the other.
Delivery driver was very late, but never called for directions if he was lost?
This was my first and last time ordering."}
{"text":"Not bad for $5ea. Delivered when they said they would. Quick, cheap!! What more do you need when its omg late & your driving abilities are more than slightly impaired haha!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service!!! 
I order a large pizza, wings, and bread sticks. They took two hours to deliver it!! And once my food arrived, my food was COLD!!! I called to speak with the manager. The manager was suppose to give me a credit for the food I order BUT he didn't. The manager was only willing to replace the $5 Large pizza!! What a rip off!! My order was well over that amount of a $5!!! Your better off going to Little Caesar Pizza. AND don't sign the receipt until you check your food"}
{"text":"Love it; more choices for crust flavors and good deals for pizza, drinks, and appetizers."}
{"text":"This is the only hungry howies that will deliver to us, even though there is two that pop up online. They've been hit an miss before, but this last one got me. I live around the corner, it took an hour and a half to deliver wings an a pizza roll. When I called, they were rude. When the order did show up, the driver was rude and was a brat about not having a pen so I could sign for my order. No sauce for my roll, the roll had maybe half a handful of pepperoni and no cheese. The wings? Still kinda frozen."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch, got a combo with a regular (8 in.) calzone and a 20oz. drink for $5. My first time ordering from this location, and I had a good experience. There doesn't seem to be a delivery minimum, and I got my order in just 25 minutes, even though I was quoted 55 min. on the site.

As for the food, I got the pizza deluxe, which is cheese, sauce, and your choice of three toppings. I went meat-centric with pepperoni, ground beef, and bacon. The flavors were clean and straight-forward, and reminded me a lot of something I might make at home. The bacon and beef were both good quality which is kinda a crap shoot, and the sauce was just a straight tomato flavor, not too sweet or overly herbaceous. My only regret is that it was a little greasy, but that's my own fault for going with three meats. Next time, I'd probably stick to one, or throw something like onions or green pepper in instead.

Good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We've ordered from this location over 20 times because we liked the food and even though we have to wait 20-30 mins longer than places that take half the time we still ordered here. After tonights order we won't be getting delivery here anymore. The estimated delivery time always shows 60 mins, it doesn't usually take the full 60 mins but if it does we understand. Tonight it took over an hour and a half to get our delivery. I called to make sure they had the correct address because it has never taken this long to get an order and because we recently moved [even closer to where they are located]. The manager had nothing to say except that it was on it's way and the delivery driver had our order. I voiced my concerns about it possibly being cold by the time it got here and she said if it was cold or not up to our standards to let the driver know and they would remake it. Why would I have them remake it and wait another hour for my order? It sucks when you enjoy a place enough to order frequently but they can't even accept that this wait time was ridiculous or offer something for the inconvenience. It was just basically, it'll get there when it gets there, tough luck kinda service and it was very unappreciated."}
{"text":"I love hungry howies pizza, however on the easy coast where I am from and have had hungry howies more, things are a little different. This one has a drive thru so that was a nice feature. 

I wish they have the taco pizza, or taco sub. I think that would be a big hit here. Does take a long time on a Friday or sat to walk in and walk out with your dinner."}
{"text":"Wasn't that good,, tasted a lot like Pizza Hut,, really wasn't worth the price.... You can tell they use frozen dough.... The sauce tasted like it came straight from the can.. Just wanted to try it once,, but I assure you I will never go back....  I can make a better pizza at home...."}
{"text":"Only reason I like HH is because of the cajun crust."}
{"text":"Don't order delivery...

Waited an hour when we were told it was going to be way less and when it came it was as cold as if it were leftovers from the night before. Took sooooo long when this is the pizza you order when you're drunk and just want to eat. 

Did not come with any cheese or pepper packets or anything :( 

The one star is for the flavored crust hahah"}
{"text":"It took me about a month from when I moved across Harris before I figured out where this store was hiding.  Since then I've been four times, twice leaving with pizza.

The first time I ordered online, that was fast and simple. Did a $5 pepperoni with the garlic crust, loved it.  Second time popped in to get their version of Little Cesar's hot and ready, that was good and about that same.  Next two times went for the same but they only seen to keep one actually ready, I end up leaving because I don't have twenty minutes to wait.

If they'd keep some pizzas ready for their advertised specials this place would be five stars, since they skimp I gotta take stars off.  Too many other places I can stop at when I decide I want pizza on the way home."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this particular location on numerous occasions. On average probably twice a month. Food is usually what I expected and I like their product. Service on the other hand isn't up to snuff. Several times they've screwed my order up, often leaving ingredients off completely. The last time I ordered they left chicken off my order and I was told that I'd get a credit on my account for the next time. So tonight I called my order in (I usually do it online). An individual named Zach answered, and I proceeded to place my order. Simple order, 2 salads, 1 antipasta, and one basic with nothing but mushroom and chicken. I asked for the breaded chicken instead of the grilled. Zach informed me that they didn't offer the breaded anymore. No problem I said, \"do you still offer the boneless chicken wings\"? \"Yes\" he replied. \"Fine\" says I, \"I'll take a separate order of those!\" I didn't ask for him to substitute, although that seems to me like it would have been simple enough. But hey, that's just me. Total order with driver tip -$27.83 

Anyway, that's not even why I'm upset. So at the end of my order I say to Zach that I think I have a credit on my account from them leaving an ingredient off the last time, it was maybe a buck or two. His reply was that he didn't see it. I reply that I assure him that I'm not lying about it. Again, he replies that it's not there. I then ask to speak to a manager, and Zach informs me that he is the manager.  Flabbergasted, I tell him to just place the order as is, and proceeded to tell him what real customer service looks like, and that am a frequent customer. Zach proceeds to tell me that the last time I ordered was 2010. Yeah, maybe by phone! So, not only has this guy insulted me by insinuating that I'm lying about a couple of bucks, now I'm lying about how often I shop there! You're on a roll Zach! I've spent hundreds of dollars with this particular HH over the past couple of years, and for a freak'n couple of dollars and some power trip they'll no longer get my business."}
{"text":"Today was the first time our family tried this pizza place. Poor customer service skills. Couldn't take my order over the phone right the 1st time. Sent my son to pickup dinner. They forgot some items. Deep dish pizza was burnt around the edges. I called in and acting supervisor wasn't of any help his name was Kyle. No apologies what so ever. I really rate this place no stars. :(

Today we re-visited and our order process was excellent. When we picked up our pizza was hot and ready! Thank you!! To the Manager for listening to your customers."}
{"text":"Howie Bread is a outstanding value, you can customize your flavors!

Flavored pizza crusts are good. 

Ability of staff to execute order to instruction is inconsistent, hence why this is 4 stars instead of 5 stars.

{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza of all time! I used to work near this location and I ordered pizza at least 2 to 3 times a week! You must try their flavored crusts! The garlic crust is amazing!"}
{"text":"They were fast and friendly.  I placed an order then immediately called back to add an additional topping.  I asked how much extra it would be and she said \"Free - Merry Christmas! \"  Maybe I chose the wrong type of crust (herb) but it was salty and the cheese bread didn't have real melted cheese but sprinkled cheese.  It was not good and very oily.  Maybe next time I will order differently and hope for the best.  Not bad but not the best."}
{"text":"Love this place, the salads are fresh and the food fantastic, the new management is very kind, must try."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was ready for me when I got there 20 minutes after my order, but the pizza itself? Trash. Maybe I'm picky, or came on a bad day, but the dough was very bland, the cheese was barely melted, and the \"medium\" was undersized. I could have gone to little Caesars for half the price and gotten the same product, not an exaggeration. I wanted to like this place, but everything was just too mediocre. The girl at the counter was nice when I picked up my order, but the two young men that were also working there were making loud yelping noises across the kitchen and sitting on top of the front counter, instead of, you know, working. Lesson learned, continue going to New York Pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Sit down place that after food was paid for, snidely refused to serve tap water. In Arizona.

Assholes."}
{"text":"Last night I hosted a last minute MNF party at my house. I spoke with a very polite and respectful employee named Danny. I placed my order through him and explained to him I needed this order to be right. He reassured me without hesitation my order would be taken care of. When my order arrived, I thoroughly inspected everything and boy was it spot on! Pizza and wings well done as I ordered. The wings were seasoned perfect with the right amount of wing sauce. My guest were very pleased with the food as I was and wings were definitely a hit! Thank you Danny for your attention to detail, your outstanding customer service and the great food! We will be ordering here, along with our friends, in the very near future. HH should be proud! 

Thank you,

When I spoke to the guys on the phone he didn't see the order and charged my card for $28 dollar when it should of been $18 fixed that issue by charging my car for the SECOND time for the right amount. When the pizza both of them had no cheese and no pizza sauce (what the point of pizza with no cheese or pizza sauce) ..called up there AGAIN and the douc!he who anweres the phone was no help and they would could do anything for me.. only help me by CHARGING my card for the THIRD time, after the pizza that was already been paid for.. time at this point I didn't want anything to do with them..I have been goin to hungry howies for years and never again will I order from this place!!"}

Today, there was a girl putting Hungry Howie's flyers all over our neighborhood and walking with her dog that wasn't on a leash.  I watched the dog tearing through our bushes and then pooped in the neighbors yard.  Won't give my business to a company that has such careless and inconsiderate marketing practices."}

Hawaiian with Asiago crust...yum! 
The delivery time is FAST and the delivery guys are really nice!"}

{"text":"Ordered cheesy bread and when it was delivered by the ultra douchey delivery driver, it was so overcooked, it was black. Gave 2 stars for the girl on the phone giving me a credit on my next order, although I think I will order from the store on Cooper now.
How can they pull something out of the oven, see that they killed it and still package it up and deliver it? They just don't care."}
{"text":"Pizza is good same day, anything cold and reheated isn't so great. Enjoyed the pizza for the most part and didn't mind the hour plus delivery time. Up untill today when I ordered a deal and then tried to use my free birthday coupon. They said my coupon wasn't good because they needed a 5$ purchase at regular menu price. So I added another 10$ worth of Howie rolls to which brought my order to over 35$ with the other stuff I ordered. they then told me I still didn't meet the requirement because I had another deal already going on. Lame Hungry Howies. I can understand the whole need to order X ammount at regular price, but when I do that and you still wont take my coupon come on :("}
{"text":"Their pizza is terrific, but they have lost my business.  Twice now I've called with two different coupons THEY'VE given me and they would not honor them.  There were no expiration dates on the coupons, sorry Hungry Howie's that's just bad business."}
{"text":"Ordered a free pizza I won. Went to website to order more pizza's to pick up. The corporate website noted $5.98 Large 1 topping pizza's. While attempting to order it noted this location's online ordering was not working, so to call the franchise. I did that and mentioned the online ordering was not working. When mentioned the price noted on the website the manager noted they do not have these same prices (as their corporate) and would not accept the advertised price noted on the company website (even though the website order option was not available to customers.) I shared the Promo Code from the website & still it was not accepted. Paid the higher price for the additional pizza's (as I was feeding a crew) but felt that the franchise should align more with their corporate (at minimum price match) if the online system is not an option (for customers & is down.) Not a place I'd return to given the customer service."}
{"text":"Never get my order correct. Never remember the dipping sauces. Then when they come back they still bring the wrong number of sauces. Ordered here for the last time today. Getting it wrong every time. Well at least they're consistent."}
{"text":"I order from here whenever I'm craving pizza. Never has me disappointed. Food is great and the employees have always been nice."}
{"text":"I placed an order a few weeks ago and went to pick it up and the manager was busy taking a phone call when I arrived. I kept trying to make eye contact with the other person working who was about 15 feet behind the manager making pizzas. I could just feel my pizza losing its delicious temperature as the minutes passed by. After several minutes of trying to get the other employees attention the manager finally put the person whom he was speaking to on the phone on hold and came to get my debit card to pay for the pizza. The food was good, and thanks to the manager who actually cared about me getting my food when it was hot I give this place 3 stars. I rarely eat pizza but when I do I want it hot, fast and cheap. Howies usually does all 3, but 2 out of 3 for a pizza joint is unacceptable."}

Quantity of toppings suddenly went half the amount the i usually see.

{"text":"I find it only fair to share my great experience here after reading some of these reviews. I ordered some pizza (w/ bacon and pineapple) and cheesy bread for delivery last night and was thoroughly impressed with the food and service! I was told it would take 45min-1hr. That was fine because the Super Bowl was on and they were probably busy. BUT I got my food in 35 minutes, yay! The delivery girl was super friendly, upbeat, and seemed to like her job. I have never eaten Hungry Howie's pizza before until last night. I loved the garlic herb crust! I think I found my new favorite pizza chain!"}
{"text":"I've had good and bad experiences with Hungry Howies in California, but i decided to give this one a try.didn't feel like the usual Papa John's so i went ahead and ordered online.while not as flashy and awesome as Domino's online ordering, it's simple to use.had a large half mushroom-half black olive pizza with a ranch crust.if you are trying the flavor crust for the 1st time, i recommend you go with the thin crust as the regular one kinda gets soggy after they apply the flavor juices to it.my only beef was the delivery time.1 hour delivery time on a Monday afternoon is shit.this might have had something to do with the online ordering, i dunno.next time, i won't be so lazy and just call them up."}
{"text":"Just returned a pizza that had a piece of hair actually baked in between the cheese and crust, a long long piece. Absolutely disgusting! I return the pizza with one bite taken out if one piece and tell them I want a refund. They only return my money for my pizza, not the bread I ordered. I drive 5 miles there to pick it up, 5 miles back home, give miles back, then home again and I get an I'm sorry.  The only reason they even get the one star us cause I have no choice put to pick at least one."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but they told me one price on the phone when I ordered (the \"special\", then when I came in they charged me a different price. Manager didn't care at all. I called to try to make it right, not really concerned about the $2, was very nice about it, but the manager was not concerned and literally hung up on me when I was trying to discuss it."}
{"text":"Really consistent food.  This was my third time ordering food for delivery and they just have what you are looking for in delivery.  Good pizza, flavored crust yummmm and it doesn't taste like cardboard!!!"}
{"text":"It has gone from bad to worse now...Cannot take proper order and make mistake Everytime with order.Also, pricing is a problem and sometime obnoxious."}

{"text":"Delicious every time! The crust is never mushy. Also, the garlic herb crust never lets me down."}
{"text":"Few pizza houses do deals as good as Hungry Howies does. It seems like every month there's new deals to be had; me and my roommates were fans of the 3 Large one-topping pies for $21 deal. Most, if not all, of their pizzas are good. Not to mention, they make some of the best Hawaiian pizza this side of the country. While the wings aren't the best there has been, they're good enough for any fan of the stuff. The howie bread, on the other hand, is great! It comes in regular, cheesy, cajun, or cinnamon. The cinnamon topping is the only one I'm not fond of, the others are all delicious. 

This is definitely a must-have for college students or roommates. Cheap tasty pizza doesn't come around often!

I've had one or two friends complain about the greasiness of the pizza, so if you're particular about your pizzas (or a self-admitted pizza snob) you might not like it much. 

Personal favorite dishes:
Pepperoni pizza w/ Buttercheese crust
Hawaiian Deluxe (AKA Howie Maui) w/ Garlic herb crust
Sausage w/ Cajun crust"}

{"text":"Every other Hungry Howies location has great food and service. This store is an absolute joke and has been for years now. No matter how tired you are and how badly you want pizza delivered, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS STORE, you will regret it! Drive to another location or get your pizza delivered from another brand. They never deliver pizza on time or even luke warm for that matter. Not a single employee/manager cares about their customer satisfaction. They will purposefuly not bring enough change in order to force a tip and steal your money, and I wouldn't trust a single crook there with your credit card number. Do not waste your time or hard earned money, avoid this store like the plague."}
{"text":"This place is a joke right? I order online and it says I have about a 30 minute wait,  that seems fine to me. Well 45 minutes later I finally call them and the girl says \"Um yeah, we only have um 1 driver and he is um like busy, so um when he gets back he will um bring you your pizza.\" 

Are you serious?  So now I have a pizza that is just sitting at the store waiting and waiting.

Guess how long 30 minutes turned into?? 

1 hour and 12 minutes. It didn't help his time when I have to sit on the phone and give him 4 minutes of instructions on how to get to our location, which is not hard to find

The girl on the phone managed to say that she would give me a credit on my next order, I should probably order now so I get it next week!

Paid extra for extra topping and got maybe 14 mushrooms on an entire pizza, that leaves several pieces without mushrooms at all, this whole experience has been a joke."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Our delivery guy forgot the marinara sauce for my calzone and I told him it was okay but he insisted on running back to the store and getting some and even threw in two extra free if charge. Amd was back within 5min. Best pizza in town"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 pizzas and a Howie bread online, was told it would take 20 minutes. 50 minutes later we are still waiting to pick them up. 

Their customer service is horrible, you see people standing in the front to pick up their pizzas and you let them stand there for 10 minutes to say their pizza is still waiting to be cooked? They let their phone ring and ring and ring without answering...get a little organization going on in your business. 

One customer got upset and walked out & they didn't even care. After an hour of waiting when we finally got our order, which was missing the sauces we paid for, we walked out to the parking lot to see two of the drivers standing there talking to their friends.

To top it off the place was filthy, and the AC was broken cause it was about 150 degrees in there. All this BS for mediocre (at best) pizza?

Yeah....this is the first and LAST time we will be going to Hungry Howies. I bet the great Robert Irvine from \"Restaurant Impossible\" couldn't even save this dump."}
{"text":"Not awesome. Just not a very good flavor or texture pizza. We were all pretty disappointed with the cheesy bread and the pizza we got. Too greasy, the sauce tasted like canned tomatoes, no seasonings, and it was too hard to chew. The cheesy bread was the most disappointing. My kids wouldn't even eat it. Will not be ordering this again."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery at 6:07pm on a random Thursday night an hour later it's still not here I call them for status and they said they had it for pick up and their app has a glitch, guy said he would remake and send out it's now 8:40pm  and it's still not here I am literally across the highway in park ridge , this is ridiculous!!! We are starving!!!"}
{"text":"we love Hungry Howie's.  never a problem...love the crust.  crew is always nice.  the only thing I did not enjoy was the sandwiches...the \"bread\" was doughy.  the pizza is spot on delicious....love the cinnamon bread too"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  Boneless Chicken, terrible, step down from a crappy school lunch.  Salad, terrible. Pizza, also terrible, the box was tastier than the actual pie. Service, terrible, post high school rejects and not the cool ones. 
-try north side Nathan's or metro pizza"}
{"text":"Not great. Not gross. 
It's cheap, $5 for a large pizza. 
Think- little Caesars- but my fav thing about this place- flavored crust. 
My fav is butter-cheese. 
Sure, my heart and arteries disagree but my tastebuds and belly is happy. 

It's cheap, fast pizza. I've indulged many times during my college days. Now- years after graduation, I'll give it a go from time to time. It's $5."}
{"text":"I never ever complain but I have finally had enough!

Being a dad with kids I am always getting pizza and since the Hungry Howie's in Anthem  is a minute away I frequent this place a lot. The staff here is made up of the RUDEST people I have ever come in contact with in my life. Not only are they rude but they mess up my order 80% of the time, and I always end up having to wait an extra 20-30 minutes(even waited an hour one time) since they always mess up! This place has ruined my day on many occasions and I have finally had enough I will take my business to pizza hut from now on!"}
{"text":"I had to drive in to pick my order up to find out that they didn't have the correct ingredients.  But they made a completely different pizza that they thought I would buy.  They said they \"tried to call\".  There is no call from the store and no message.   Outstanding..."}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza with delicious garlic crust! And all for so cheap! Mmmmm :)"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Had a kids late bday party for 15 and decided to order a few pies.. They told me pizzas would be ready for pick up in 15 minutes, after I arrived doors where locked and management told me store was closed.. I told him I put my order in and that I had kids waiting on the pizza.. They apologized and closed the door again.. 3 minutes caused this place a bad review and lost a bunch of angry parents and  kids business.. I don't recommend and thank you Little Ceasars across the street that took care of us with great service and was able to get pizza for the party.."}
{"text":"I don't do the pizza thing anymore (vegan) but my husband loves this pizza! Plus, the employees are ALWAYS friendly. I just wish they delivered one block further so I don't have to pick up my order every time :)"}
{"text":"Always faster than expected. Thin crust is perfectly cooked to a crisp perfection. You think you can't get good quality for these prices but until you try the pizza you're wrong."}
{"text":"Excellent deep dish pizza.  Had the butter crust which was very good. The brownie was free with $15 or more order. Would definitely order from Howies again"}
{"text":"This is about both the service and products. When I placed my order online it said my food would be ready for pick up in 15 min. I had to drive almost 10 miles to get there, so it had definitely been 15 minutes or longer by the time I walked into the store. I was told by an employee, who was standing around, to wait for another employee to get off the phone. I had to wait longer than 7 min for that, even though my food should've already been ready to pick up. After he finally finished taking an order over the phone, I told him I was picking up an order and I gave my name. He charged me, I paid, and he said he'd be right back with my food. He went to get it and realized only 2 of the 3 items I ordered were made. The missing item was the salad. He said it would be just  a few more minutes because they needed to make it. I was annoyed because they could've been making the salad while I was waiting for the one guy to get off the phone. I could've paid, gotten my food, and been on my way. But I had to wait another 5 minutes, only for them to tell me they were out of salad! The employee in the front asked me if I wanted something else or a refund. I said just give me a refund. So he gave me back the money for the salad, and when he gave me my pizza and sub, he said \"Don't even worry about it!\" I thought that was pretty rude because they obviously didn't have any clue about what they were putting me through as a customer, nor did they really even care. So I just took my pizza and sub and was finally on my way. After driving all the way back to my home, I began eating my sub, which was supposed to include ham, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, parmesan, and sub sauce. Since they were out of salad, they obviously didn't have any lettuce or tomatoes, so they just stuffed my whole sub with ham and cheese. I only ate half of it because it tastes pretty gross. And they didn't even give me sub sauce or italian dressing, which was supposed to come in  the side. I can't  believe they charged me the full price of the sub, when they only gave me half the ingredients! Not only that, but why did they have to waste my time?! They should've known in advance they were out of salad so they could tell me as soon as I got there. And not just stuff my sub with only ham and cheese and then not say anything. Also someone else could've helped me instead of them making me wait for one guy to finish taking a phone order which consumed a ridiculous amount of time and attention due to the # of details. As I was leaving, I watched a guy go in and he was out with his order in less that 2 min! I will never go to this location again because the employees there were so inconsiderate and careless. And I had to go really far out of my way to go there and back! Worst Hungry Howie's experience ever! :("}
{"text":"I paid for a medium 2 topping pizza at 11 and received it about an hour after. I opened the box and they just gave me a plain cheese pizza. I called them to tell them their mistake and a guy says \"hold on one sec\" and proceeded to complain to his co worker and one yelled \"I just want to go home!!!\" I said never mind and they proceeded to hang up on me. If you're going to be rude and complain about working then why do you work there?!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and like everyone else said unprofessional. I like the pizza only reason why we keep giving them a chance. If they would just be honest and say delivery time will be an hour or so because they are busy or due to not enough drivers, I would completely understand. I explained this to the manager but he just got upset and raised his voice. No apologies and continued to say it's only 20 mins late! Never again"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is GOOD. If you love pizza then this place will not disappoint.

Most locations will deliver (like this Chandler branch), but a few will have you pick your order up. It's not a place where you eat at, in fact you might not find a table and chairs to eat your food.

Alright on to the food! What's to say? The pizza is great. It also comes with different crusts to choose from. I definitely recommend the garlic crust, or the cajun crust. I am actually not one for trying \"Exotic\" pizzas, but this place is get's it right.

The Howie's Wings are great as well. The BBQ wings have enought meat on them compared to other pizza restaraunts.

I expect nothing but good to great reviews for this place. Try it now!"}
{"text":"2 hours to get a pizza?  Really?  On a Monday?  And it's not like it's gourmet pizza...never again. Worst $30 I have spent in a minute."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and the wings are the best I've ever had from any restaurant.
Best of all, you get to add flavor to the crust. My family likes the garlic and herb. Another plus, you can place orders through their app."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. Ordered food at 9pm. It's now midnight and I haven't received anything. Not even a phone call. I have been trying to call the store since 10:50pm and no one is answering the phone. Checked my credit card and it's been charged twice. This is the absolute worst experience ever. Save yourself a headache and call Papa Johns or Pizza Hut if you actually would like to receive some pizza."}
{"text":"I am SO sad to have to rate this business one star because me & my family have been loving their pizza for almost 3 years since we moved close by and have never had any problems before this, but I cannot let this go.

 On Halloween we ordered ahead for a pizza for carry out. We ordered 45 min ahead and were told it would be done within one half hour. After arriving a half hour later, someone gave our pizza to someone else, and then told us that our order had not even gone in the oven yet after waiting for 15 minutes in the restaurant for our pizza. My husband told them to please forget our order and refund our money, as we could not wait any longer. My husband was not mad, was actually pretty understanding of the situation as it was a busy night and we just unfortunately could not wait any longer. He was first ignored, then after asking again nicely for a refund,he was given attitude by the manager who had to refund the money. 

We did not think twice about the incident until we called in again to order pizza for my sons birthday. We were told that we could not order. Our number had been blacklisted. Why? because we wanted a refund because we simply could not wait for the pizza any longer on Halloween. The person who stated we could not order was EXTREMELY rude on the phone, did not allow us to speak to a manager, and ended up hanging up on us TWICE. 

I am disgusted by the behavior of the manager and the workers in this establishment and unfortunately (though it is my kids favorite pizza) we will no longer be paying customers. I have never had a professional business hang up on me. This place should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"Great and prompt service, yummi pizza. I ordered a large two-topping pizza, 2x pepperoni, they did not disappoint. You couldn't even see the cheese underneath all the pepperoni. 
Loved the crust (thin). 
This is my first time trying their pizza and for sure it won't be the last! 
Delivery time was just as expected. Overall, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great wings, always get the cajun crust. Mmm"}
{"text":"I've always loved their pizza and the customer service was okay, unless you want to take advantage of their late night delivery. I ordered pizza around 2 am for delivery and after an hour of waiting I called back to see what the hold up was. The manager began to get an attitude with me and saying that the driver came to my apt, knocked and called several times and didnt get a response so he went home. I told this \"manager\" that we received no phone calls and have been waiting patiently outside in case the driver got lost. The guy on the phone said too bad sorry and didnt offer any compensation or even an apology. I will not be going back and its a shame because I used to love this place.

Great pizza, WORST customer service"}
{"text":"Really long wait time, pizza was so greasy it was soaked through the box and inedible. Called to have a replacement made or a refund for the order, was told by the manager Jeff he doesn't know what I expect and that's what you get when you order pizza. He also suggested not getting pepperoni or butter crust because it can make the product inedible, yet they have it on the menu. Worst attitude I've ever seen/heard from a manager. Photos will speak for themselves, don't recommend this location even though hungry howies as a whole tends to be decent."}
{"text":"HH is definitely nothing fancy but our family enjoys their pizza and cheesy bread. They've always gotten our order right and always fast delivery. no complaints. good for fun family night on a budget."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED our food!  Hungry Howie's delivered our \"baked subs/calzones\" in a timely fashion; still very hot and sooo delicious!  We had the steak, mushroom and cheese and the Italian!  Both of them were loaded with delicious ingredients; the \"bread/crust\" was AMAZING!!!  We also decided on an order of 3 Cheese Howie Bread with garlic butter sauce on the side!!  I think I have found my new addiction!!!!  We will be ordering again......and SOON!!!!"}
{"text":"1 star , should have been zero stars . order by phone was told 20 minutes i showed up early and was told it will be 10 minutes. i was fine with that knowing that i was early but then when someone walks in and places an order for two medium pizzas and was told it would be 20 minutes and gets her order before i get mine witch was just an extra large pepperoni will not get repeat customers ."}
{"text":"3 of the 5 times we've ordered here they've given us the wrong pizza. Even at the sale price of $5, it is not worth it. I'd rather pay a bit more and get better tasting pizza that is actually what I ordered."}
{"text":"I love hungry howies,and order from here fairly often,today I ordered some cajun wings to go.
They come in either 8 or 16,I opted for the 16,went to pick it up and it came to $18.95!
I'm not one to bitch about price ,normally.. 
But a buck a wing from a chain pizza place is ridiculous!
Apparently they're under new mgt"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place I was stunned on how you can choose what flavor crust you want for your pizza. I always get Cajun bread,really gives a kick when you bite into your slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery... I got chicken wings a sandwich and a cheesy bread. After ordering it took about 40 minutes to get my food. The delivery driver was very nice she told me about a special they have going on. I had the steak sandwich it was good nothing special. The cheesy bread was also just ok nothing special. Last I tried a few chicken wings I had got the bbq the bbq was not to good any the wings were small any really fatty. All in all I would have it again but not to soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Hungry Howies! Prices are good, (cant beat a $5 1 topping large pizza), and the pizza is delicious. I love the Cajun crust the best, definitely worth trying. The sesame crust is good too. Scratch that, I like all the different flavor crusts. This location is right around the corner from my place, and I am so glad for it. They are always sending out awesome coupons, so if you havent tried Hungry Howies yet be on the lookout for some coupons so you can."}
{"text":"Good pizza for the price. Their online ordering system could be better as it never tells you how long it will be before the pizza is ready for pickup. Even in the confirmation email the time isn't listed. Each time I've had to call them and ask how long it will be before I can pick up the order I just placed. Somewhat pointless to order online when I still have to call the place."}
{"text":"One day I went to pick up a sandwich at Subway next door and decided to try Howie's.  the food smelled good and I placed an order. The guy working handed me my food and I paid and left. On the way home a friend sent me a text asking what I was doing etc. and I said I went to Howie's. his response was \"don't waste your money\". When I got home I took a few bites. The rest went into the trash. Never again."}
{"text":"I've always loved hungry Howies,  they're actually my favorite. Until the last two times I've ordered a salad too. Both times the lettuce was brown and gross. So I finally called the last time and got a credit on my account. No big deal.  I just called to place my order and asked to use my credit towards my pizza since I have no intention of getting the salad ever again.  The guy on the line was very polite and helpful, however when he asked the manager she said no. I'm annoyed that the money I spent on two disgusting salads that directly hit the garbage can can't be rolled over to something my family would enjoy on our occasional pizza night. Hopefully they fix this policy."}
{"text":"The food could be worse. It's like domino's quality but not quite there. The wings, however, were prefectly hot. not as crispy or anything as i would prefer, but their hot sauce brings a good amount of heat.

Here's the real issue: we ordered at around 11 pm on a Monday night, and we didn't get our pizza until closer to 12:30 AM. Also, I felt like it was expensive for the quality/portions.

I'd only order from them again for the same reason I ordered from them this time - literally no one else would bring me pizza at that time of night."}
{"text":"The employees don't seem very happy. I always feel like I'm inconveniencing them by ordering. Pizza is so so. Overpriced wings"}
{"text":"i have been eating Howie's sense 2001 and i have never been unhappy with anything. they are better than papa johns, pizza hut, domino's,LJ'S, and godfathers . the salad's are big and always fresh, the wings are perfectly spicy, not to hot , not to weak. i don't have to wait very long for delivery and the food is always hot and fresh.the pizza is killer and the Howie bread is so yummy unlike any other bread i have ever had. i always get the Howie bread. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've liked Hungry Howies in the past.  This time I ordered a small pizza and a large pizza at 6:17 pm.  I received and email indicating that I would receive  our order in 60 minutes.  I called at 7:30 to see if the delivery driver might have been lost only to be told by the person who answered that the online system is incorrect and they are actually running 90 minute (keep in mind this is a week day not a weekend).  I asked why they had a system that said 60 minutes and he put me on hold.  A couple of minutes later an \"assistant manager\" picked up.  She told me that their system is wrong and sorry but \"too bad\" this is what I had to deal with.  She said actually it was going to be another 30 minutes - that is 1 hr and 40 minutes to get a pizza...because they didn't have it done and no driver was available.  This is definitely a management issue. The assistant manager did not offer to make it right in any way.  We have enjoyed Hungry Howies in the past but I will not order from you again if this is the customer service I am going to receive!  Sadly, I thought you guys were better than this!"}
{"text":"I've lived here for almost 6 years and lived by RT71 for 6 years before and have never had a bad experience until today. I ordered a large pizza and Howie bread at 11:08, right after opening. I live 4 minutes from the place and I was told 40-45 minutes for my order. Fine. I waited and waited and called at noon to check my order. The lady that answered said the girl already left and should be at my home soon if she wasn't already. I gave it almost 20 more minutes. By now, I've been waiting over an hour for one pizza and bread. I called again, and was told the girl should have already been here and the lady said she would try to call the delivery girl to see what was going on. I was on a hold for a few minutes and was told she couldn't get a hold of her but she could call me back. I ended up canceling my order. Terrible. I was offered a credit as well but I won't be returning after this experience."}
{"text":"I got the large $10 meat lovers pizza with garlic bread crust. I had a 20% off entertainment coupon.

Wow, this pizza had tons of meat and cheese on it. So much meat it would make a Vegetarian sick. lol

I could only eat 4 pieces and i was full. ate the rest within a few days.

I plan to order more pizza's from this place soon."}
{"text":"This is the fifth pizzeria in this location, each more disappointing. This new pizza location for the chain again does not raise the bar. The ingredients are  not fresh on any level.  If you seek the frozen pizza effect then this is your choice.  First take stock in the Tums Corporation before ordering on line. Sorry i look forward to th we next pizza location."}
{"text":"First time eating at Hungry Howies and will certainly go back. Service was friendly, pizza fresh and hot and we enjoyed trying the flavored crusts - Ranch and Asiago."}
{"text":"Their flavor crust is the star of the entire pizza, the rest of it taste just like any pizza place. I also tried their wings and I don't recommend it. Their Rolls is good too."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to order pizza from. Lately the amount of meat has decreased and the service has gone way down hill. Tonight we ordered a Philly pizza that had 0 meat on  it and no garlic crust at all. The staff was rude about our complaint and this entire establishment has lost a big time customer. I don't recommend ordering from here at all."}
{"text":"Had a calzone here and fantastic is the only way to describe it.  They gave me a lot of options for sauces and I didn't use one of them.  I am a bit of a purist ie: the way it comes should be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed."}
{"text":"I ordered Hungry Howie's for a group gathering over lunch.  I ordered around 10am for a noon delivery.  The woman I spoke to was very helpful in helping me make sure I got everything I needed for the wide array of diets I was working with.  She assured me the delivery man would call when he was leaving so I could get to the right delivery spot in the office park.  She also said it would be no problem to get it there by noon. However, I called around 11:55, and the woman told me he left 20 minutes.  25-30 minutes later than expected, he showed up with no apology.  When asked, he said he was busy. I had a room of hungry people and a tight timeline to work with.  Now today I looked at my credit card charge and was charged approximately 15$ \"accidentally\".  The pizza was fine, but I was not impressed with the delivery or execution of service.  I will not be ordering from them again for any office event."}
{"text":"Great pizza great price, called to order and was greater very well and they worked with me in the specials. Great place, great pizza!"}
{"text":"We ordered several pizzas to be delivered. They came late, cold, and very overdone.  Hard to judge the quality when they come in that condition."}
{"text":"Will never, ever, order from this restaurant again.  No phone call letting me know my order was going to come a hour after order placed. Called to check on order, and was told we just got the order our fax was down. Then guy hung up on me after acting as if it was my fault they screwed up. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"First off the pizza is alway great! The flavored crust are amazing! But even better is the customer service. The leap year sale I think was more popular than they planned for and it was a bit of a mess  which resulted in extra long wait times. So long that I canceled my order after I paid. But when I stopped by to follow up with why I was still charged, I was given a prompt call back and the situation was fixed. The guy was apologetic and friendly."}
{"text":"The food from here is outstanding! I ordered a pizza from here tonight and was told it would take 20 minutes, I left my house 15 minutes later and upon arriving at the store I was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes (probably had not even been put in the oven yet). After waiting 25 more minutes I was told my order would be ready in 2 minutes. The lobby was full of people waiting on their orders too, one woman got there ahead of me and was still waiting when I left. Another customer had asked if a military discount was available and was told no, it's hard to believe that in the state of affairs the world is in some businesses still do not recognize the contributions our military has made to our well being."}
{"text":"I just ordered from there. And paid $25 (including tip and drivers tax) for a teeny tiny pizza and some half assed boneless buffalo wings and a 2 liter Pepsi. Uhhh... Yeah. Their hours are pretty good sure and it's nice to be lazy but I'm starting to think if this was worth it at all..."}
{"text":"Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks.

Ordered online and got a message back that pizza would be ready i. 15 minutes. This was at 6:15.

Was running late and got there at 6:40.

Thats when i first encountered Moron Girl (MG).

ME:  i'm here to pick up a to go order.
MG: Uhhhhhhh, what's your name?
ME:  annika
MG: Uhhhhhhh, do you have another name?
ME: Hmmmmmm, no
MG: Uhhhhhhh, are you sure? Uhhhhhhhhh, here it is. I couldnt find it cause you ordered online.

(big red flag that i failed to see)

30 minutes after i ordered the pizza:

ME: is my pizza almost ready?
MG:  Uhhhhhhhhhh, it's in the oven.

Tick tock. Tick tock.

45 minutes after i ordered the pizza:

ME: do you know how much longer it will be?
MG: Uhhhhhhhhh, it's coming out now.

Nearlyone hour after i ordered:

ME:  did you start making this pizza after i had been sitting here for 30 minutes?
MG: (and try to visualize this blooming eejit with the blankest, stupidest expression on her face): Uhhhhhhhhh, well YOU ORDERED ONLINE.  I didn't have anything to do with it.

Really? REALLY?????????

Pizza was nothing special either."}
{"text":"omg!!!!!!    big piece of hair in my pizza!!!!!!!   yuck!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in anthem! I ordered a large pep with garlic herb crust. The lady up front was nice and told me it would ready in 10 minutes. This was great because I only have a small lunch break. Food came out fast and hot. I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I like the pizza. Pretty cheap, can have a quick dinner provided you order it 20 mins before you can pick it up. Sometimes the crust gets really hard but yeah cant expect a great one for 5 bucks."}
{"text":"The pizza came when they aid it would.  It was hot and fresh and very good.  The delivery guy was very nice and carried it in for me as I was holding my dog. Will use them again!"}
{"text":"Over 20 minutes late on when they stated food would arrive.  Ordered extra sauce yet pizza dry.  Boneless chicken wings all had grissle/fat in them and were soggy with about a table spoon of sauce.  I should have eaten the top rommen I had on my shelf that is 5 years old. For a company trying to do something different with their flavored crust, customers are remembering you for poor food."}
{"text":"I had a bit of a saga with HH recently. We placed an order for pickup, and they gave us a pickup window. I went to pick up the pizza, and it wasn't even close to ready. It took them an additional 15 minutes past the end of their window to get us our food. They were very apologetic and told us there would be a free pizza on our account next time we ordered there. These things happen, and they offered us a fair recompense, so I could live with that.

Or rather, I could have, if they had actually given me the free pizza. The next time I called in with my account information, the person who took my order had no idea what I was talking about. That made me very unhappy, all things considered. After canceling that order, I wrote an angry note on their website and wrote off HH for good.

The next day, I got a call from the store manager. She was very apologetic (a theme with them), and this time offered to place three free pizzas on my account. I figured what the hell- for three free pizzas, I'll try to order again sometime. The manager assured me the three pizzas were in their system, and told me to have the employees there call her if they couldn't figure it out. So, next time I wanted pizza (and had a bunch of friends over!) I called. This time, the free pizzas were actually there. Better late than never, and three free pizzas was a fair price for all the aggravation I went through.

Long story short (I know, too late), I feel like they did a great job in retaining me as a customer. I prefer HH pizza to any other store near us (their asiago crust is SO good), so I'm just as happy that they managed to get everything sorted out in the end."}
{"text":"Stop putting your menus on my door twice a month. I don't want it. I don't want more trash- I already get enough in the mail. If anyone wants to order from you they can just walk outside and look on the ground cause there is a 90% chance there will be a menu under their feet."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their garlic herb pizza, it's delicious. I like that the pizza isn't overly greasy. I usually order delivery, and they always give a 60 minute or more time frame, but rarely make it in the designated time frame. They are generally between 10-40 minutes late."}
{"text":"I appreciated the decent food, but other than that everything else was pretty poor. I ordered the pizza for pick up 30 minutes in advance and when i arrive the place was dead empty and my pizza wasnt cooked yet..."}
{"text":"This stuff is fantastic! The crust has just the right enough of crunch, and you can choose your flavor - sesame and garlic herb are my favorites. Toppings are high quality, and the sauce is delicious. Topping choices are decent - not as many as I'd like, but they have green olives, so consider me a happy customer! Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Average name brand pizza but with the flavored crust. I usually go up the street to Johnny B's unless they aren't open yet and the kids are driving me nuts for pizza and we are next door playing computer games at SL computers. Low quality cheese and crust like most other chains. They usually make a 4-5 out of 10 but hey it's cheap so there's no room for better quality."}
{"text":"Nothing best pizza I ever had but not the worst either. Have a great deal for one topping $5 large pizza. They have an option of flavors for their crust. I personally like the Cajun one. If you're looking for a cheap pizza that a step above Little Caesars this is  the place to go. They also have a great deal that includes two large one topping pizzas garlic bread and a two liter which is great for a group and it's only $15."}
{"text":"The pizza is as bad as Little Caesar's and much more expensive. This was the first time I ordered from here and waited 1hr 20min to luke warm pizza.. Would not recommend to anyone who is hungry, doesn't have time, enjoys good pizza, or needs food to feed their pet."}
{"text":"The staff sucks, but the pizza rocks! Every time they are rude I swear off them forever...but always go crawling back for some of that garlic herb crust."}
{"text":"It took 40 minutes to get a pepperoni pizza from these guys when we were told it would take 25. The pizza must have been ready for a while but instead of calling our name they put under a heat lamp. I went up to the counter to ask when our order would be ready and he handed it to me from where I'm assuming they keep it under a heat lamp. They also never answer their phone so while we waited the phone was ringing non-stop regardless of there being 4-5 employees there."}
{"text":"On such a rainy night, my bf and I thought it'd be nice to watch the Tele and order pizza.  After ordering at 615pm, at 745, we realized just how hungry we were and just how late the pizza was.  Now, I get that it was a rainy night so we gave them a call to check the status and we were told that with the weather conditions, orders have been pushed back to a 2 hr wait.  45 min to 2 hrs?  Thanks for the courtesy call.  30 minutes after that, still no pizza so I called to cancel and they couldn't even find the order... awesome.   So then I ask about the refund and I was transferred to a darling peach of a manager and asked her when I can accept the refund and she responded quickly  with an \"I don't know.\"  Ooook.  Thanks for being oh so helpful.  Then! 25 min after that, the driver shows up with the pizza.  We had already figured out an alternative, so thanks but no thanks. Great customer service and communication, Howie!  Guess who lives down the street, hardly cooks and will never order from hungry howies again?  This hangry elf."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how much I love this place. This is how I survived college. 5 dollar one topping pizza...is freakin awesome. I recommend this pizza to anyone and everyone. If you have a party to plan or just need a quick bite, go here. You will not be disappointed. The sauce is good, the crusts are delicious, and the guys inside are pretty chill too. They get really busy at night so be warned there. I usually just pick up, I have never had it delivered."}
{"text":"Be nice if I had some pizza about now. Ordered an hour and a half ago and it never showed. What a flake  pizza joint. -called 3 times and some one was there to hang up the phone every time so I couldn't even leave a message."}
{"text":"We love the quick delivery and its hot. Also the herb crust is very good. Cost is alittle much for the medium so order large."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location and I wasn't let down at all. The order arrived in fresh condition and in less time than I was quoted. The driver was also extremely pleasant and courteous the entire time! Great job!"}
{"text":"Had to sit and wait since we did not order ahead. Cashier made sure to get us the best special. Decided to try out stuffed crust on one pizza; it's nice to see that more places are adding this option. Food came out on time, but one pizza was a bit brown and the bread was crunchy."}
{"text":"Two out of three times that I've gone here, I have been shown there is a reason why I stopped going here.  
   This time, I will just say, don't order online.  I was charged online, and had to pay when picking it up.  I was too tired to bother with another food source, but this is b.s.  If I am refunded one, when the charges clear, I shall amend this review, but as it sits I am keeping the warning up."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I absolutely would this is the last straw with hungry howies. I called to order a few calzones or as they call them subs and a salad I told him my address and he said was it in Mesa I said no it's in queen creek he took my order and said 35-40 minutes okay fine..I waited the appropriate time and gave him a call he goes \"your order was cancelled because it was too far\" I said oh they said my address was ok so I spoke to the manager who is THE RUDEST and very argumentative mind you he was the one who TOOK MY ORIGINAL ORDER and said the address was okay! He said we called you three times and it says something about magic jacks??? I even called you on my personal phone which sounds like a work violation but okay. So finally I ask him to read the number back and it's absolutely correct and he goes well I already apologized. I have spent thousands here whether that be school events or work but I am completely finished."}
{"text":"Not quick, now I understand why Howie is so hungry. He does not eat his own pizza.
Yuck."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. The dough was perfect and the cheese was a hundred percent mozzarella as they say it is. Veggies were fresh and not from a can. And the young lady at the counter was very sweet. Will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Hungry Howie's was 20+ years ago and had been impressed. I was pleased when a store opened nearby. The taste and value paled when compared to childhood memories. The food was extremely greasy and smaller portions than recalled. While far from my debut experience, it was tasty and decent bang for your buck. I love the option of flavored crust being complimentary as sets it apart from other \"budget\" pizza options. We enjoyed the pepperoni pizza \"roll\" but was significantly smaller than I'd remembered. It's essentially a Strombolli. Options were steak, pepperoni or chicken. Being 2 for $6, I was reluctant to order steak or chicken that can be sold that cheap. I'm a bit finicky about meat quality, but the pepperoni seemed a safe bet. That said, was impressed by the flaky, perfectly browned crust. I love pizza sauce, so ordered it with extra sauce. While tasty, the roll had very little sauce or cheese. Luckily, they sell pre-portioned sides of their sauce, so that worked out fine. Next time, I'll splurge for extra cheese as would likely improve it greatly. This time, I ordered thin crust, usually a favorite. Unfortunatley, this thin crust lacked the texture/flavor of their original or that surrounding the sandwich. Eating without a fork a challenge. It did however taste decent. The bacon, beef and mushroom were sparse, but onion plentiful. I will likely order from Hungry Howies again, but not something I can't live without. The app wasn't terribly user friendly, but they got the entire order right, even with all my \"special\" requests. Something of a rarity these days."}
{"text":"This is honestly a horrible establishment. Every single employee is beyond rude and 100% not be in a customer service role. My order has been wrong multiple times but I'm always hesitant to call and ask for it remade because they seem like the kids (and yes, I mean kids) to spit on your food because you had them remake it for you. Just today, I ordered Howie bread with extra cheese and what I got was a nearly burnt loaf with a few sprinkles of cheese. It isn't even on one half of the bread. The prices and quality of food are decent but the employees ruin the entire experience. If you're going to eat hungry howie's I recommend going to a different location."}
{"text":"Yuk. I haven't eaten this pizza since my kids got older and now I know why. Won't go into a drawn out review. The staff was/is nice like the other reviewer stated. However the pizza---- if that's what you want to call it is just horrific. Terrible beyond words. Processed, commercialized junk in a \"pizza\" shape. Got the wings and they were so salty I cldnt stomach them. 
I will never and I mean NEVER  eat there again. Ever. Ewe. How are they still in business is what I wonder?!????"}
{"text":"I'm not usually the type who goes into a place that is about to close but I did. 

I was expecting end of the night glares from the workers there but as I hurried into Howie's to pick up my order, the man behind the counter greeted me kindly. He was just finishing up my order, boxing it with care. And here I was, expecting it to be thrown in with toppings only half still on the pizza. 

I apologized for coming in so late and thanked him for his hard work and he told me it was no problem at all. The thing is that he really seemed to mean it. I appreciate the workers at Hungry Howie's, I appreciate the pizza I received because it was just as good as it would have been if I ordered it at 5pm. 

Thank you Hungry Howie's for feeding me later than I should actually be eating and being very nice about it."}
{"text":"I called in to place an order, and the girl said she was new, and it took her quite some time to figure it out. She put me on hold a total of 4 times.  I get it, I have been new, so I told her no worries, placed my order and waited. It took an hour to get there, which was also fine, that was the etimated time.. here is the 1 star part of the story..

The delivery guy showed up, just pizza, no soda. I said that's fine, but how do we resolve this? He said call the store, the shift leader Ramon can talk to me about it, and he wouldn't mind driving it back out.

So I called in, Ramon said, \"Oh well its not on the order so..\". And I said but I ordered, it so, can you have him bring it? And he said, \"You're on the outskirts of our delivery area, so we can't for just a soda sorry\". 

I have worked in customer service, and I have never, in all my life, especially as a manger, decided to handle myself in that manner. THEY messed up, and its just, sorry deal with it?! Not even, we apologize, its on us, but we cant make the trip back out because we are slammed. Nothing.

I will never ever ever ever order from Hungry Howie's again, which sucks, because I actually really like their pizza, and order often."}
{"text":"Pizza was really bad. My pan pizza was burnt.
Frozen pizza was better than theirs. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's is good pizza IF you do NOT order the Thin Crust pizza. We accidentally got 2 Thin Crust pizzas because of a mis-worded online offer. The Thin Crust pizza is the WORSE pizza on earth. You would be better off going to Fry's and getting a frozen pizza. The Thin Crust pizza is basically a large saltine cracker with a smear of tomato sauce.  Absolutely the worse pizza of all time. This bad review is solely targeted at the Thin Crust pizza. The workers and managers at this location are great people and the stuffed crust pizza there is a good value and tastes good. BUT I repeat, the Thin Crust pizza is horrible. Even more and more beer did not help its genuinely bad bad taste. Whatever marketing idiot that dreamed the Thin Crust pizza up should not just be fired but black-listed from all pizza companies. Cold pork and beans tastes better than the Thin Crust pizza! The Hungry Howie's Thin Crust pizza is the Ebola of Pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Hungry Howies, but the South Blvd location continues to disappoint. Whether it's the ridiculously long delivery times, incorrect orders or worse, I have not gotten satisfactory service here. Will go back to using South Tryon"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Pizzas and after 1 hour and 20 min apparently the driver delivered it to a different house and we never received our order!  So glad I didn't prepay for it.  If you are so busy maybe you should hire more staff."}
{"text":"The other night, we were starving after coming home from Mill. It was about 2 am and we thought pizza sounded wonderful. We called up Howie's and ordered a large pepperoni pizza, figuring it wouldn't take too long, since we were right around the corner at the District...wrong. 
About an hour after ordering (when they said it would be between 30-40 minutes), the phone we called with originally died, so we called to give them a new phone number to reach us at when they got here. After asking for an ETA, they said \"Uhh...soon. The driver is on his way.\" Wonderful! ....30 minutes go by and we call again. The guy says our driver is at our apartment so we go check...nope. 
After 2 full hours, we call AGAIN. This time, the guy starts yelling at US. We explain that it's been 2 hours and it is getting ridiculous. He argues that it hasn't been THAT long and he has no clue where the driver is. We want to make sure we'll get a hot pizza, especially after waiting for 2 hours, but the worker says we'll get the one we were getting originally...Finally our pizza shows up, 2 1/2 hours later, around 4:30 am, cold and gross. 

Never again, Hungry Howies."}
{"text":"Must be a joke, Their thin crust pizza I have had better children's cheese crisp in Alaska. Only good thing about H.H is the Cajan Crust... Just curious don't they have people who do market research and test these things... Who ever is on charge of that should be fired."}
{"text":"We had never tried a Hungry Howies until moving to the area recently.  We like deep dish pizza.. We are now fans of this place!! Its not a gourmet sit down pizza place but its pretty darn good for fast food pizza and they deliver. We like the pan pizza with butter cheese crust flavor or the garlic flavor! The cheese bread is good also! Staff was good to us! They messed up our delivery order one time and I called and they took care of our next order! Thats service I like and appreciate! We will return!!"}
{"text":"Had this for the first time tonight. It was sooo good. I had an ad on my door the other day. I had the pizza calzone, bread sticks and a Ceasars salad. The delivery was fast. Food was nice and fresh. I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I have hungry howies for the first time every a few days ago and I must say the at it was so so good i was at work when I order it and love it the staff was great and very helpful"}
{"text":"the pizzas are on par with what you'd expect from a chain these days ..as good as Dominoes for example.  Delivery even on busy nights like Saturday is faster than the others. We've used them for years.
The reason for the lower than average rating however is due to their repeatedly getting our orders wrong lately, usually for placement of the toppings ( which half gets what), or in the most recent case, leaving a topping off entirely tho we were still charged for it.  That's just sloppy quality control and service, and is making me think twice about ordering from them again.  Since we order online, the store gets a printout of the exact pizza specs, and the printout receipt is always correct for what we ordered ...so it's not a case of something accidentally not written down or miscommunication.  it's the execution that lacks."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here, I think because there is hardly any marinara sauce on it and the crust is a bit on the crispy side. I think that the ranch crust is salty and so is the onion crust. The cajun crust is a bit spicy, which gives the pizza an added dimension. The toppings tend to be a bit sparse. I like the ham, I like the pineapple, and I like the tomato as toppings even though there is not a lot of it on the pizza. If you like pizza that is light on the sauce and grease you will like Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan, I was so excited to see this!!! The first couple of years or so, we'd place our orders monthly or maybe twice a month.  The pizza was amazing and everything I had missed!  Therefore, it's been really sad the last 6 months or so getting the worst and most disgusting pizzas delivered to our door.  We always order the same thing...deep dish pizza and a salad.  They've gone from cheesy and hot to cut into breadstick like pieces with little to no sauce or cheese.  Barf!  I just ordered tonight because my husband said to give it another chance, but again, Pizza was gross.  Salad was gross.  Ugh! Can't wait to move back to Michigan!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pepperoni pizza, howie bread, and five ranches. The pizza came delivered cold, they forgot our ranches and Bowie bread as well. I called and they said they would not deliver the howie bread and the ranch that I PAYED FOR. The man on the phone could barely hold conversation and was not logical at all. Five dollars isn't a lot but that's five dollars wasted because of your employees being unprofessional. It's not that difficult to put an order together and deliver it. Re-evaluate your business. Specifically, at your location."}
{"text":"I just had Hungry Howie's for the first time in awhile and it was most excellent. I can't believe how good the pizza is for it being a value place. We loved it and got a kick out of the special herb crust. They have some great deals here, which I love. I'm definitely going to be ordering from here on a regular basis from now on."}
{"text":"Had this for the first time the other night! BOMB.com!!!! And delivery was way faster than it said online. I will definitely order from here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 4pm, the delivery estimate was 1 hour, no problem. At 630pm with no pizza I called and they said it was \"in the hot case\" and he \"didn't know why we didn't have it yet\". I was understanding, said no problem, and he informed me it would be ANOTHER hour before they could deliver it, even though it had been sitting at the store for 2 hours. At 8:30pm I call again. The same guy on the phone tells me that he \"told the driver to take it with him and he forgot\". I told him to just refund my money, I don't want my 4 hour old pizza anymore."}
{"text":"Manager was so rude to me on phone she said they had no corporate office and that there nothing that I could do. She was so disgustingly rude and I will never order from this company"}
{"text":"Just picked up my order and very unhappy with my order. I ordered their $5.00 pizza it's a small 2 topping pizza. I ordered extra cheese , pepperoni with ranch crust. I open the box to look at it only to find out it has very little pepperoni that only surrounded the crust,  none  in the middle (I always get it this way and it is covered with a generous amt of topping). I talk to the girl behind the counter and express my feelings on it. She says sorry but that's how we make it unless you ask for double. I tell her that I've never had this issue before and if I had known that I wouldn't have come here in the first place. My second pizza was fine and the wings were as well. 

Not in any rush to ever go back again"}
{"text":"Just ordered from this place for the first time. The delivery was on time. I really like the pizza, its a good cheep pizza, and I also liked the Howie rolls. But the chicken wings I won't order again I don't like the texture and they seem very gelatinous. Overall I like the place and will order again"}
{"text":"We usually order somewhere else, but got a coupon in the mail that we thought was a good deal and decided to give it a try. What a mistake. Online ordering with the coupon was awesome and picking up the pizza was no problem, it just tasted horrible. We ordered a bacon and pineapple and it was so bad we threw out the leftovers. Never ordering here again."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, and delicious.  The employees were all very helpful and friendly.  This place is great!  I like that they have flavored crusts and gluten free options!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Upon opening the box to my pepperoni pizza, my first thought was  \"Is that all of the pepperoni we get?\"   There was a small amount of pepperoni that appeared to have been tossed on the medium pizza.  The toppings on our other pizza were sparsely scattered as well.  I'm not really looking for pepperoni to cover every space on my pizza (think Donato's) but I do expect at least 2 pepperoni's per slice. The web-site menu showed that a medium pizza had 8 slices, and it probably did, but it was the little squares.   BTW, I HATE the square-cut pizzas - bring back normal-sliced pizza!!   I didn't have enough sauce on my pepperoni pizza to know how it tasted, but all in all, the pizza's need to have more of the requested toppings added. 
OK, enough of the bad - now on to the good.  
Their thin crust is very thin - the way I like it.  It was crunchy and the sesame crust was wonderful.  The few pepperoni's that I had seemed to be cooked to a slight crunch - which I also liked.   Their antipasto salad that I took for lunch still looked fresh the next day; the lettuce was nice and green - not old looking.  It had black olives, pepperoncinis, almost enough meat and cheese, and was really good.   I didn't know whether to go with the \"Hungry Howies\" packaged greek or italian dressing, so I got both, but finally decided upon the italian dressing.  It was very good, but I suspect it's made by the company that makes \"Wishbone\" dressing; the taste was nearly identical.   Regardless, it was good.  
I do plan on going back, maybe for more salad and/or sandwiches, but possibly another thin sesame crust pepperoni pizza - add EXTRA pepperoni please!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in and ordered a pizza as did my coworker. We sat down and waited. 15 minutes passed when they realized they gave my pizza away to another customer. So I sit and wait another 15 minutes. While I'm there I overhear them say they will give the guy that got the wrong pizza a free pizza for the mix up. When it came to my pizza, they said here you go and sorry. That's it. To top that off, I asked for butter cheese crust and all I got was butter. I even asked them to redo the crust, and they just buttered it some more. If it wasn't for the fact that the pizza is good and a hell of a deal at 5 bucks, and not to mention the closest Howie's to work, I'd never go back. Damn you howie for being so good! I recommend you call in your order because sitting and waiting for it is like sitting in a sauna because its so hot in there."}
{"text":"placed a order for a 3 topping medium pizza. was told 20 minutes it would be ready . got there got my pizza home and devoured it. think my toppings were bacon pepperoni salami? flavored crust which was delicious as well"}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered the works deep dish! Very good! Will be coming back definitely. I'm normally a grimaldi's, settebello's, verrazano's or Due Forni pizza eater but Howies is definitely in my top five now. Never heard of them before"}
{"text":"Okay guys I'm a shift manager for this location my number one thing for you guys that have complaints please call i urge you guys too we cannot fix the issues if you don't let us fix what is going on there is a new GM most of the stuff that was there almost a year ago or less are gone so if you call with your complaint we will make sure that we fixed the issue that has happened"}
{"text":"I use to work for a Hungry Howies and generally like the food. This location, however, has its flaws. I've ordered delivery at least 5 + times and every time something is incorrect. Be it ranch flavor crust and get no flavor at all, pizza not cut, extra sauce comes with no sauce, cinnamon bread with no icing... seems careless. The delivery has always been timely although the deliverers themselves seem rude often. This last time the order said 45 minutes or later and it was at the doorstep in 20 minutes. Delivery person was furious I was late... sorry I guess?"}
{"text":"This place has terrible service I waited for 45 for a pizza. Do not come here. We were fairly optimistic for the price stepping in but boy were we in for a surprise. We order a large pizza and the cashier informed us it would take 13 minutes. As you already know they were wrong. The place has little seating and is flat out reckless in the back. There was banging and tomfoolery going on back there and it was not professional. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Cold delivered pizza. Salad was limp. Wrong order of chicken wings. We ordered plain and we got spicy. The problem was the manager who refused to accept the fact that we received spicy wings. Said I must be mistaken. All went in the trash. It is the last 65.00 I will spend at Hungry Howie./"}
{"text":"Great local pizza delivery. We get delivery from here pretty often - several times a month. The staff is friendly and we never have issues with our food. The only thing is they sometimes (very rarely) forget a side. I've had other hungry howies around the valley and this is my favorite one. The pizza is better than other budget delivery places. While it's not the most gourmet pizza it hits the spot and is always our go to delivery place."}
{"text":"I won't give this a 1 because the food was edible and the 1st Cashier employee was nice.
   My friend and I ordered two 2 topping pizzas, Howie bread and two 22oz drinks for $22. which was reasonable.  My friend opened her pizza to find a hair in it.  She takes it back and the manager and employees start a discussion/argument with each other over whose hair it is. At least they remake it.   We receive only one sauce with breadsticks not pizza and they want 69 cents for another. After giving the 2nd cashier a dollar for the sauce, he gives me a quarter back. Can we say Math Major?  Okay, Hot Pepper would be good. Can I have some?  Third employee says for 10 cents. So I say, Well the last guy gave me a quarter change for a 69 cents sauce, why doesn't he just take 4 cents and call it the difference?   Humorless guy says, \"I can't override it.\".        Needless to say, I will finish what I brought home but we aren't going back.     And don't ask for extra cheese!  I wasn't even going there."}
{"text":"Lamar helped my mom and I the other night and he provided us with some of the best customer service I've ever experienced in my life. He made us laugh and seemed to really enjoy his job. We will definitely be returning to this location just because of him. He deserves a raise and a promotion. Definitely the kind of person who should have his own team!"}
{"text":"We waited so long that the counter person forgot who we were and tried to take our order again. Even the buttery goodness of their crust wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ok maybe my fault for trying again but seriously.i did get my food this time, over an hour and half. And did have to call again. I'm eating cold bread. I didn't use managers free pizza bc, well I hate confrontation. I believe in 2nd chances, not 3rd. And just opened pizza took one bite, trash I want my money back!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I get mad at myself every time I order from here. I constantly give them \"second chances\" bc we love their pizza more than anyone else's. Food is always great, but the service is horrible, and getting the order accurate NEVER happens. Once I called at 10:15am to find out they don't open until 11. No problem. Said I'd call back after 11 to place my order. Called at 11:15 to make sure they had enough time to open up shop. Guy was SOOO rude on the phone said he couldn't make my order, he had \"other things to deal with\". So I said that's not a problem, I'll give you my order, and whenever you guys can make it is fine with me! His reply was \"uhhhh, can't you just call back in a half hour or so?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME????? - mind you its 20 after 11am. They are OPEN! hung up pissed off, ordered Pizza Hut, and hated every minute of it. Still continue to order from here, never have our marinara, never have sauces we paid for, had Cajun crust over butter cheese once, forgot our 2-liters, twice.., say 30 mins-takes an hour, says 45 mins, takes almost two. The list goes on. Tonight we ordered a pizza. I asked them to bring a 2-liter that we paid for last week, (which the guy said he took down a note about it), and he gave me a hard time over the phone saying I needed a receipt. As if I'd bitch about a 2.50 liter, or make it up to get \"something free\". No, it was paid for. Just want to get what I paid for. He agreed to send it, but it was a bit of a fight. Still unsure if it will actually make it this time. Anyways, pizza was ordered at 7:03pm. It is now after 9:30pm and pizza is still not here. This is my LAST order. I've learned my lesson. The good food is and will never be worth what they put you through. The only reason I'm giving one star, is because there's no option for zero."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I love Hungry Howie's and haven't ordered from here before because my husband doesn't care for them, and I'm always trying to convince him to give them a shot. I placed an online order of a medium pizza, a small pizza, and a roll. I ordered at 2:01 and it was delivered at 3:12. I had to call the store and speak to someone, and he informed me the driver had left and should be there. He said he'd check on the driver and to call back in a few minutes. In that time, I could've drove there (if I had access to my car at the moment). When the delivery guy finally showed, the pizza was barely warm. So bummed cause I am starving and was looking forward to being able to eat without having to reheat my food first."}
{"text":"The pizza has always been great value and the kids working there polite and hardworking.  Much better quality and value for pizza at the same price point."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! 

Highly enjoyable. The new stuffed crust was not a favorite though. 

Cheese pizza light sauce extra cheese- yum!"}
{"text":"In the morning, I received a mailer for a free medium 1-topping pizza.  It was fate because at the end of my workday, the last thing on my mind was cooking dinner for my family (sorry family!)... Sorry not sorry cause Hungry Howie's came through!  It was super convenient cause as I was about to leave work to pick up the kiddos from daycare, I easily registered on the site and placed my order.  Used the free pizza coupon and BAM! Received an e-mail saying they got my order in and it would be ready in 20 minutes!

Picked up my order (which was reasonably priced!) and paid in cash.  The pizza tasted good, kids and hubby were stuffed and we lived happily ever after... the end!"}
{"text":"I like Hungry Howie's Pizza since we don't get it often. Today's order was a bit of a disappointment. They need more staff on Sunday! I placed an order about 12:30pm and was told it would take about 20 min. This sounded normal so I took my time to pick up my order. Arrived to the Surprise location to find out that there was 1 person to make pizza and 1 for delivery. Although the 1 staff member was kind he underestimated how backed up in orders he was. What should have only taken 35 or 40 min took over an hour. Please hire more staff for Sunday."}
{"text":"I've always had great experiences at this location. Andrew, the manager, is very friendly, professional and courteous and has that place at the top of their game.  Reliable, fast and fresh. That's the best way to describe it.  I recommend the Howie Rolls (Pepperoni & Cheese), the wings (any flavor), the pizza (I've only had the garlic flavored crust), and the turkey club sub.  A friend of mine had one of the salads and it looked delicious.  they have so many options here.  But as usual, i cant get past the options i already love.  Whether you are looking for a lunch option, dinner or it's late, consider THIS Hungry Howies location."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE LOCATION & CUSTOMER SERVICE. Every time I order from here they manage to mess it up somehow: missing/wrong items, wrong flavored crust, they've even sent me an uncut pizza on 2 different occasions. The manager Chase (who I've dealt w/on multiple occasions) is complete trash. He is extremely rude, has no idea what customer satisfaction is & can never do anything to resolve the issue. Basically avoid this location at all costs !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza at 530pm didn't receive pizza until 730pm.  This was my first time using them.  I don't think I'll use them again. Epic failure!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what the hell these folks in these reviews are talking about but this is some good damn pizza... better than papa john's. I always order the $5 pizza with sausage & pepperoni. This pizza is GOOD! Period."}
{"text":"For a chain pizza place, this is the best of the 4 or 5 that are in this section of town. The crust and overall taste was spot on. Service is pretty fast, I ordered before leaving my place near Hualapai, by the time I got to the place the pizza was getting boxed and ready."}
{"text":"love the veggie calzone, not a diet food for sure but sure is good"}
{"text":"I love Howie's pizza and Howie bread always made perfectly and delivered earlier than expected. I order online and have never had any issues. The flavored crust is the best"}
{"text":"Great price, great pizza! Love their thin crust, my always to-go pizza place :D they offer various coupons for web order too"}
{"text":"they have flavored crusts and the pizza itself is pretty good =) great experience would go back if i wanted a to have a movie night at home with my amazing wife =)"}
{"text":"CAJUN. CRUST. 

I am a total Hungry Howies fan. Cheap, fast, and original crust flavors that work.

Their online deals are amazing so make sure to take advantage of their promo codes! I got a free medium 1-topping pizza with minimum $10 purchase! 

The cinnamon Howie bread was kind of a let down. i would lean towards trying the savory options."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Love their crust and their actual true delicious stringy mozzarella cheese!  I just wish they delivered to my house but it's worth the drive even after a long work day. My great grandmother is a fan as well and makes me drive 15 min out of the way opposite direction of her house from mine just for a yummy pie!  hope you guys get more locations or start delivering to me since I come so much! Durango/lone mountain"}
{"text":"I would have left a big fat 0, but the option would not let me. I made an order using Yelp Eats and the food was never delivered. The location had the nerve to advise the Yelp representative that the food was delivered when the order status clearly stated it wasn't. Then the restaurant advised that there was an issue with my order and attempted to call me, however there were no missed calls. The restaurant just made a ton of excuses that clearly did not make any sense. Was my order delivered like you said or was there an issue. Make up your mind and stop lying because you're too lazy to do your job. 

Never ordering from this place or setting foot in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Admittedly not the best pizza in all of Tempe, but it's definitely the most reasonable I've found, considering price and ingredients.  It tastes much better than a little Caesars pizza for nearly the same price - how could you go wrong?  Sausage and pepperoni are the best!"}
{"text":"The people working here are nice and the inside is clean. I had howie bread and that was hard and the pizza sauce that came with it tastes terrible. I liked the thickness of the crust on my pizza but the pizza itself really lacked flavor. The pepperoni and sausage on my pizza did taste okay but the pizza all together just wasn't anything special. The amount of toppings on the pizza was fair. There was supposed to be a garlic flavor on the pizza crust but I tasted nothing but a so-so pizza crust. I'm a big boy who can eat a lot and could only eat 1 and a half pieces. I'm not a huge fan of Little Caesar's but the pizza there is cheaper on your wallet and actually has taste to it."}
{"text":"This place is soooo nasty! There hardly any toppings and the pizza dough was so thin and gross, will never go back again!"}
{"text":"What a sick feeling to speak to your parents on the phone thousands of miles away and hear \"we are starving\"! My mom has both hands in splints from a recent injury and dad has macular degeneration so they've not been in the car for much of anything lately. I went online and found only a couple places that would deliver to them. Hungry Howie's let me go through the online order process but then my heart sank when they called to say mom and dad were not in their delivery zone. I explained I was out of state and could not pick up so they offered to cancel the credit card charge. Happily the next call was also from Hungry Howie's saying the driver had offered to do the delivery in spite of the distance. I can't thank them enough for accommodating our needs. It made my day to know there would be something for mom and dad to eat this weekend."}
{"text":"Food never got delivered and my order is still processing the next morning. Called and was put on hold. No one ever answered. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Owner valued a few dollars and his pride more than my 2 year history of ordering an average 15 pizzas per month.  I ordered their special (5.55 for a large one topping) with pineapple, they brought me a large Hawaiian.   This was a few dollars more.  I called them to discuss error.  The owner had to call me back.  He insisted I was wrong and would not budge.  Hmmm.... nearly 400 pizzas (I'm ordering for 10 people) ALWAYS one topping and I was wrong?  The error was not that big a deal, it happens.  What was a big deal was how the owner so pridefully and stubbornly handled me.  So if you want to just be another dollar, eat there.  If you want to have the value and respect of a loyal customer supporting a family business, eat somewhere else.  Buh-bye Hungry Howies."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The staff is so rude. I was told to pick up my pizza in 20 minutes, I sat in the place for a full hour before I got my pizza and wings and my wing order was wrong. Even though the container said hot they were most definitely BBQ. While sitting in the building waiting you could tell the place suffered from horrible management. The staff was yelling at each other, screaming that they were out of boneless wings and having to call people back and see what else they wanted instead. Not to mention the woman who was running the counter was flat out rude. She didn't apologize for making is wait so long and didn't care that the wings were cold but the pizza was hot. I will most definitely never go there again ever."}
{"text":"Only business. That has lost my business in under one minute. Don't hang up when I'm talking and asking questions about your menu just cz my number showed up blocked and then accuse me of calling blocked when my number isn't block. I wasn't try to place an order.. I just wanted to know what you had on your menus. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Foods always hot for us, we call In and pickup. Service is always extremely fast and courteous. We can place and order and it's ready in 15-20. Highly recommend BBQ chicken pizza on Cajun crusts! Our son loves the mini pepperoni pizza!

Thanks Hungry Howie's for your consistency!"}
{"text":"First of all, I was told no more than 40 min, called an hour after ordering and they said it was on the road and that I only called 57 min ago. And as he got off the phone he said it will be on the road shortly. ????? I thought it was on the road already!!! Now an hour and twenty mins  later of waiting I finally received my pizzas! But get this I say thank you to the delivery boy and he walks off and says a tip would have been nice! Poor customer service! Opened my pizza and the whole Effin pizza is burnt!! Horrible!"}
{"text":"I have now ordered pizza from this location 3 times. All 3 times I ordered pizza and wings with ranch. The first order the pizza was missing a topping that I had to pay for, the second time I ordered there was no ranch that I had to pay for and the delivery driver acted like it was my fault when I asked about my ranch, asking if I even ordered ranch and to check my receipt so I did, which I was charged for. He told me he would have his manager call me because I was pretty upset that this was the second time I ordered from this location and they messed up my order and even more since the driver acted like it was my fault. I called in pretty upset and the manager said they would take care of me, nothing happened besides them saying I was sorry and I still had to pay for my ranch. So I decided today to try one more time thinking that maybe they would have made a note on the account to pay attention to the details of the order but nope, I had to tell them that they now have messed my order up twice and Casey which is the manager said she would give me a free ranch with my order, I was happy with this since I already paid for it on my last order and never received it. The delivery driver showed up once again with no ranch and he told me that he would go back and get a ranch and bring it back really quick since it's only a mile away, well it's been over an hour and no ranch. I called in and talked with Casey the manager and she said they are sorry multiple times but I still have no ranch. If I could I would not give them any star but have to give at least one. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. Manager didn't really seem to interested in trying to do anything about this situation besides saying sorry and blaming her delivery driver saying it's his first week instead of fixing the problem. Don't order pizza here if you like ranch because they for the life of them cannot deliver what you order and pay for."}
{"text":"They got 2 stats cuz you have to pick A Star to comment.  It's really not worth a 1 star it's gross customer service is bad. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews of this place. It's obviously run by kids off for the summer and or a part time job because every time I call I get a prompt answer and half way through my order the person says \"hold on\" a bunch of laughing, then I have to repeat my order. The slotted time for delivery is ALWAYS 45min - 1hr. Today, it arrived within 20 min and the pizza was not cooked thoroughly. The top was fine, the rest was spongy and like wet! 

  Just know what to expect when calling and don't do anything while waiting because it could show up 20-40 min early."}
{"text":"I called hungry Howies to place an order before I left the bar that I was at and about 15-20 minutes I got a call saying that they were outside in so I went outside and they informed me that it was the wrong number on the wrong order and they messed up but they have made no attempt to do something on the order. so they once again called me about 10 minutes later so I returned the call and they informed me that they called the wrong number and \"it's only been 39 minutes\" and our food hasn't left the building yet so therefore it's not here and the whole entire situation wasn't handled in a professional manner and the customer service I received from Howies was ridiculous"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location about 5x since I moved near it and it has one thing going for it...consistency. 

They are consistently getting lost or losing my order. The food is always good, but someone over there needs to wake up and learn to read google maps. All but one time I had to go outside after receiving a call that they were lost. I live in Power Ranch, not some rural property or expansive apartment complex. 

Their online can't find my place either, that's more of a corporate thing so I can't fault this location for it."}
{"text":"$5 large one topping with flavored crusts. Quick, simple, fast. Decent pizza when you're broke, lol."}
{"text":"I have ordered from HH a few times through PayPal's mobile app and will probably continue to order from them. They loose a star for every delivery person that has ever been sent to my house. They never have any personality or any social skills at all. I know they are delivery drivers but they barely look at you or even say hi, then ask for a signature and give up the pizza. I think they charge a higher price than the quality of pizza you receive. The salad isn't bad and usually comes with forks and napkins like it's supposed to.

Almost went 3 star but love ordering thought the PayPal app or grub hub app too!"}
{"text":"Good pizza....great price. Try the philly cheesesteak pizza, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"We ate there for lunch while staying at Candlewood Suites in the same business park. The Greek salad and Philly steak sub were both outstanding as was the service (young man who's name I did not get), professional and helpful. We ate dinner there the next evening, pizza and another sub, again all aspects of our visit was outstanding as was the food. If you are in the area you really need to visit Hungry Howies and if the Hungry Howies people read this, we would love to have you in Norfolk, VA."}
{"text":"I am always so surprised at how good the pizza is from here. It's a last resort usually when me and my room mates get pizza here but it is always on point. I feel like this is a step above little Caesars even though the prices are similar."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the most delicious pizza I have had! My fiancé and I are only in town only for spring training and this will be the only pizza we order while in town! The Works deep dish butter crust is to die for!"}
{"text":"Very upset with the new owners decision to charge .10 for each packet of cheese or crushed pepper. Is a dime really going to make or break you. Do you really feel like you need to treat your customers like that?  I seriously order hungry Howie's for every one of my get togethers for my kids birthdays etc. Today I ordered 8 pizzas and spent $80 plus dollars just to be told I had to pay for peppers and cheese. Unacceptable business practice and I will NOT be ordering from them for any of my other parties."}
{"text":"New to the area means having to find new local pizza joints to support. For awhile we just went up the street from the house to the Pizza Hut as it was familiar. But after awhile we needed to find a local place that does it better than Pizza Hut. 

One night we tried Hungy Howie's and were hooked. Hungry Howie's offers several flavored crusts, and our favorite is the Garlic & Herb. The Howie Bread is good too and it comes with several different sauces as well. 

The ability to order online is a huge plus!! The only down fall is that it seems no matter what day of the week it is, the delivery time is at least a 40-50 minute window. You can walk in and pick it up but it is not an eat-in kind of location. 

I love this place and will always go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints. Lots of options and choices to customize your order. Fresh ingredients at a great price. Customer service is friendly and they get your order thru fast. The garlic herb crusted option is delicious. The wings are also good. They have gluten free bread also which is rare at some places. Will come back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered online and got a confirmation that the order was placed and that the pizza would be delivered in 40 minutes. 75 minutes later...still no pizza. The delivery guy finally showed up after being on hold with the store for 10 minutes. He gave me some lame excuse about trying to call me but his phone was \"acting up\". He gave no apology for being late. The pizza is lukewarm. Beyond frustrated with these guys."}
{"text":"Because you decided to litter your menus all over our apartment complex we will never try this restaurant. Looks like there are a lot of other reasons not to eat here after reviewing what others have had to say too. Please try and limit sloppy behavior (such as your littering) to at least inside your restaurants rather than around people's homes."}
{"text":"I always get their coupons in my mailbox so I figured it was time to give them a try. 

So I decided to order online for a quick lunch. I tried the Howie Maui which comes with bacon, ham, pineapple and mozzaralla cheese. I loved the concept of flavored crust! They offer a pretty good selection that seem like that could work well based on the toppings you chose, but since I didn't really know what to expect, I just kept it safe and ordered the Asiago Cheese crust.

I arrived right at the scheduled time for my pickup and it was coming out the oven when I walked it...so it was piping hot! My initial thoughts were that for the price, this sure was a pretty decent size pizza! 

And then I tasted my first bite and they won me over. That crust was amazing!!! Seriously, it was more than I ever expected! I enjoyed the flavor and the crispiness of the crust. The sauce wasn't overwhelmingly sweet or spicy it was just right and they were not skimpy with the toppings either! I was very impressed....

I'm sure you can tell but I'm totally a fan. I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My son had 2 coupons for free junior cheese pizzas given to him by his school. I researched this place and was surprised to see it had many bad reviews, but after going there today I now understand why.  I called to place my order of 2 junior cheese pizzas. When I got there, the gm in charge told me they had my order wrong and had made 2 medium pizzas instead, so I would have to wait while he made the right size. I asked him if I could just take 1 of the medium pizzas in exchange for the 2 junior ones because I was in a hurry. He bluntly told me NO and that He was the General Manager in charge and that was food cost to him, and I could either wait or take my coupons back! Then he asked me if I had ordered medium pizzas over the phone instead of the junior ones? I was so surprised at his response and lack of customer service skills and tactic! In the 20 minutes I was there only one person had walked in to pick up an order. So I don't understand his food cost theory, when I work in the restaurant industry myself, because now he was sitting with 2 medium pizzas when he could have exchanged 1 for 2 junior size ones and not make additional ones, plus keep a customer happy instead of making them wait longer because they got their order wrong! I waited for the pizzas just because my son was with me and he really had been wanting them but I will not be back here or to any of the Hungry Howie's Pizza chains for that matter! Ps He doesn't even deserve that 1 star..."}
{"text":"Great experience while going in to order and waiting for it. However delivery, the worst ever. Email said delivery would happen in 40mins and an hour and half later a miracle happened and we finally got our order. Pizza was good but the wings that look like half of McDonalds Chicken Nuggets were burnt and have almost no buffalo sauce. Looked nothing like what they advertise on their website. Most definitely the last time we order delivery."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! Good prices, love their pizzas and Howie rolls. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for quality food at a good price."}
{"text":"I thought their pizza was good.  Not that big on the breadsticks. But I do like the different flavor crust.  The time I went was around lunch time (12-ish) and it was pretty quiet in there."}
{"text":"I normally love hungry howies, especially for the flavored crust. First I tried calling, and the manager Kristen asks to put me on hold, and I say yes of course and she hangs up on me. So I call back and I get a different person, who takes my order for delivery, and credit card information and confirms it will be delivered in 30-45 mins. 10-15 minutes later I receive a call back saying that they don't deliver to my address, and that they won't charge my card and give me a phone number for a location that will deliver. Well the other location they sent me to doesn't deliver either and is further away. Frustrated I decide to call Pizza Hut, seeing that I have been trying to order a pizza for 45 minutes now. Also I check my card, and it has been charged for the order that I placed but was refused to receive. I am beyond angry and will never eat here again. Even though I was shortly out of delivery range, they should have still delivered since they already charged my credit card!"}
{"text":"I prefer Hungry Howie's to any other chain (national or local, really) but not to some place like Angelo's. The flavored crust and Howie bread area truly delicious but the overall quality of this pizza is not that high. However, the price also reflects that. It's very inexpensive and they always give you more coupons. It's my go to if I want pizza but don't feel like splurging. Quick delivery usually, too!"}
{"text":"Never again. Submitted an online order an hour in advance. Had my significant other pick it up and they gave her the completely wrong order for a Maria. She brings home the incorrect order. I called the store and the person working claims that she asked for Maria's order and it was in fact him that had given it to her. Lie number one. She picked it up from a woman, not the man I was speaking to on the phone. 

I asked if it could be delivered (even if I paid the fee) and he said their drivers were too slammed. 

We then asked if it could at least be remade when we came to pick it up. He agreed and we brought the new order home. It was probably 2 hours old. It was also incorrect from my original order and it was disgusting. Will not ever be returning it was so gross."}
{"text":"My wife and I are thrilled to have a Hungry Howies in the northwest.  We used to live in Aliante, so became fans of the chain there. Now we won't need to drive 15  minutes each way to get it.

We always get the single topping $5.99 large, mushrooms with buttered cheese crust. With tax it comes to $6.48. We haven't found another place where you can get that kind of a deal.  It isn't always advertised, but we haven't ever been refused. Be sure to ask about it.



A for the pizza, we really like it. Not as greasy as pizza hut, not as doughy or heavy as papa johns.  We aren't fans of lots of sauce so this is right up our alley.  Big fans, our single source for fresh pizza!"}
{"text":"So we've lived down the street from this place for a couple years but have never tried it, so we finally decided to try it.  I was pleasently surprised.  We got the deep dish veggie, which was actually not bad.  We also got a junior pizza for my neice, it waas cute.  The one thing I thought was weird, was the subs.  They come like a calzone, which is different.  Not a bad thing, just expected the regular sandwich.  The only complaint I have is the delivery time, took about an hour, but the food was still hot so can't complain too much either.  All in all, not bad.  Id go there again."}
{"text":"I enjoy Hungry Howie's Pizza in general but this particular location is horrible.  The female who answers the phone seemed put out or unwilling when I tried to order a pizza for delivery.  

Why would she say they do not deliver to my location when my order was delivered to my same exact location 2 weeks prior?  Be prepared to give your first and last name, address, zip code, city and state, major cross streets,blood type, thumb print, retina scan, hair sample, cheek swab, and shoe size when you call to order? Seriously, why all the questions? Ordering a pizza should be an uncomplicated effort."}
{"text":"FINDING LONG HAIR BAKED INTO YOUR PIZZA JUST KILLS THE MOMENT***
A \"hairy\" pizza was originally delivered to me. When I went to the location to retrieve my refund, I noticed a young lady baking pizza that was wearing hat; however, she had a long dangling ponytail. When I asked the manager about employees wearing a hair net while preparing the food, he stated that hair nets are not required and that the baseball style cap worn by the young lady with the long dangling ponytail meets the health code. Even if this baseball cap meets the minimum health code requirements, why would management not still require this young lady to pin up her hair? I am NEVER eating here again."}
{"text":"Rarely do I order for pizza delivery.  But needed lunch for my employees and were unable to leave our worksite.  Hungry Howie's not only delivered in a timely manner, the pizza was hot and fresh!  Thanks we will call again!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain meal. The breadsticks are clearly better than the pizza. Get the Howie cheese bread for 6 bucks. It is about 18 slices of cheesy goodness. The small veggie pizza was only 7 bucks and I had it with the sesame crust. Should have gotten a flavored crust, but cheese bread was flavored enough for both items. The delivery was done through my phone and arrived right around the 40 minute mark as advertised. Not bad for once every six months or so or when the craving hits."}
{"text":"LOVE this pizza!  Stretchy cheese, sometimes crisp pepperoni, awesome sauce flavor and tons of different crust options!  I like butter cheese crust, the best.  And they have Deep Dish!...Easily THE best pizza you can get at this price range."}
{"text":"Very fast delivery but this very well might be the worst pizza I've I've ever had! High prices very small 12 inch pizzas very little flavor. I'm not being mean but I don't know how you can really mess pizza up"}
{"text":"Waited over 70 minutes for a delivery. When I finally received a small thin crust, it was cold and rock hard. Poor customer service. Won't be returning....."}
{"text":"I used to love this pizza back in ohio. I haven't had it in a couple years and unfortunately will never have it again. We got the $10 1 topping deep dish large pizza last night. Half mushroom and half ham.  The entire pizza was way too salty, we couldn't even finish it. Not sure if salt was from the sauce or something else but it was one of the worst pizzas we ever had."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer and fan of Hungry Howies even when they were on Garrison BLVD. Last night I ordered a Steak and Mushrooms Sub with Onions. It was mostly onions id like to at least taste steak in ever bit. I could not even find a mushroom. I may never order Hungary Howies again. We spent $45.00 on garbage. SMH."}
{"text":"I've had pizza in the past. What a terrible \"special\" recorded message. You will not get my business. Your the basic bitch of the pizza community. Continue to feed the masses who don't care about the taste cus your salty as f\"@& anyway. I'd rather take the time to sit theough a drive thru. You would make more money between midnight and 6am"}
{"text":"Ordered our pizza at 3:47pm, the cashier said it would be 10-15 mins. Totally fine, that is a normal wait time to make a fresh pizza. We waited at the table in the lobby the whole time. We were talking so it was obvious we were still there. At 4:23, we finally see an employee and ask where our pizza is. The employee pulled it out of a heating oven. She said it had been sitting there since about 4 pm. Irritated that our pizza had been sitting for over 20 minutes so it was no longer fresh and we had been waiting for about 40 minutes, we asked for a refund. The employee typed a few things in the credit card machine and said it would show in our bank in 3 days. We asked for a receipt for confirmation, since we didn't receive one when we paid and she was unable to produce it. She then phoned her manager who walked her through the refund process, and had us sign a receipt after. So when she had said it was refunded, she actually hadn't processed it. We got our refund, left the pizza and went across the street to capriotts and had way better service! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Nope. We ordered for delivery at 720 pm. Our food didn't show up until about 845pm. ( we checked after we ordered and realized we only lived about 10 minutes away) We ordered a calzone and antipasto salad. The calzone was cold, and disgusting. The antipasto salad was decent, but I'd be a little concerned if they couldn't  make that. Never again."}
{"text":"I have had a great experience here. I ordered 1 Lg 3 topping pizza and 1 Med 1 topping pizza both cooked to perfection although soon as I got home I realized one of the pizzas (the Lg) was missing one of the toppings (my mistake, the one I didn't check) I called in and told them the problem and they made one right away and offered to deliver it but I chose to pick it up in person because I live so close. Extremely friendly staff and no charge for the mistake five star service quality and hospitality all around."}
{"text":"Affordable, and delicious to boot! The pizza was prepared very , very quickly. My husband placed an order over the phone, we drove to the joint, and it was all ready when we got there. The elapsed time was probably only 10 minutes.

Our only regret was... we forgot to ask for a flavored crust! D'oh!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but the guy on the phone was a prick. He was impatient and rude. Seemed shocked and offended that he needed to explain the specials."}
{"text":"I have always had good experiences here. I enjoy the flavored crusts and the three cheese bread is a favorite with the children. I have never had a mistake with my orders nor an issue with any of the food. Reasonably priced and easy access make this a favorite stop. This is a great place to order from if you are having a small gathering-especially with children as the prices are fair and the pizza is of decent quality."}
{"text":"Had one of the worst eating experiences in my life at this place. They ran out of mozzarella cheese one night, but didn't tell the patrons who patiently waited. Then, when we got our pizza, it had a combination of mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese. I complained to corporate headquarters,  and they never responded.  Awful. Awful. Awful!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery several times from Hungry Howies and have not once been disappointed! The process to order online is supper easy. I love that I can add the tip to my total. The delivery people have all been very nice and friendly. Pizza has always been hot upon arrival. I recommend them all the time!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always consistent. Good flavor great prices,  service has always 5 star. Once there was an air bubble and they remade my pizza and gave me the air bubble one as well. The air bubble wasn't a big deal to me, we have a had pizza with an air bubble but the remade it after quality checking it after it came out of the oven. It was something they did without me asking them to. They want you to have a delicious consistent pizza every time! Keep up the good work. As my family will continue to order"}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent at best. Sometimes you get great service and bad pizza, sometimes you get bad service and decent pizza.

However, I'm updating my review specifically because I was contacted through Yelp by some one representing the company who told me to go to a website and share about my experience so they could make it up to me. It's been almost a month since I did so and I didn't receive even a response or apology. Don't have me waste my time to only ignore my efforts."}
{"text":"Never had pizza from there before.  Ordered online (web), stated 20 min wait time before pickup and when I got there it was ready.  Pizza was very good.  Will order from them again for pickup."}
{"text":"I have never had a problem here. Ordered many times and it's always fast, fresh and correct. What more can you ask for with chain pizza delievry?? 

I like the different crust flavor options you can choose from. I always go for the Asiago but wifey likes butter crust. 

It is a little pricey here in my opinion but convienence is not free so I am happy to pay when I have a craving."}
{"text":"This place isn't nearly as abysmal as I thought it would be.  Generally, I distrust pizza joints located near colleges.  Their sole purpose is to satiate drunken hunger, not to excite tastebuds.  Hungry Howie's manages to walk the line between the two.

I experiences Hungry Howie's at a \"free pizza\" event on campus (how unique, I know).  If I was paying out of my own pocket, I likely would not order from them.  While a step above places like Dominos and Pizza Hut, they are still a chain restaurant, and still taste like a chain restaurant.  However, the ingredients appear to be fresh.  Major bonus.  Also, the sauce tasted like tomatoes instead of like sugar.  Double bonus.  The crust is on the thicker side, but is light and airy.  Plus you can order their crust with flavors....and I'm pretty sure the people who ordered for the event did just that.  The flavor (Butter Cheese, I think) added a nice touch without being overpowering.

While I won't be spending my own money on HH's any time in the near future, I won't avoid it like the plague like I do with most \"free pizza\" events on campus!"}
{"text":"The $5 pizza was not available during my college years, but that could be a good thing. Might as well pay 5 bucks more for a more solid pizza somewhere. I had high hopes for the butter parmesan crust, but the only thing that happened to the crust was a dusting of parmesan cheese and no butter taste. Still, it's easy to get a pizza at any time here so that's a positive. I also tried the large Greek salad at $6.99. This took awhile to prepare since none were made in advance. That meant I was getting a fresh salad and it was loaded with tons of feta cheese and some average lettuce, but on the menu it said it contained beets and none appeared. The one time I was craving a beet, I was let down. It does appear that this area is a bit shady, but all the drunks picking up their tasteless pizza will protect you."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 large pizza & 1 small pizza online on a Tuesday night. 1 hour expected delivery. 2 hours later, no pizza. I had to call and cancel my order. So disappointed, I really enjoy their pizza too."}
{"text":"The pizza? Amazing! The service? Friendly! The location? So far away from my house!!  I got a buffalo chicken pizza that was so delicious! They are also super cheap! One personal buffalo chicken pizza, one extra large pepperoni, and an order of howie bread for about $24?!"}
{"text":"I like a simple pepperoni pizza on seasoned butter garlic crust and I like the hot wings.  I use to eat  from a different location but this one is good also. Oh I had a hot sub here and it was mighty yummy. Can't beat the prices and the crust if you are one who likes to eat it comes in a number of seasoned flavors and is tender and good."}
{"text":"This is probably the best delivery pizza available to the residents of scw. 

I'm glad they're here for that reason. But. If any of the local owned non franchise pizza places ever do delivery, hh will be in trouble. 

That said. The howie maui or a pepperoni and jalapeño are my two go-tos. Both well made. Delivery can take a while but it's worth waiting rather than order to from that place with a gambling problem. 

Like I said though...  it's delivery pizza."}
{"text":"I love this Hungry Howies! The food quality is the best! The Service is really fast and they keep it clean!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good for the cost but it's a little misleading when it says on the menu chicken fingers or boneless wings.  These are not fingers or boneless wings.  They are more line the cheap chicken nuggets you get at a grocery store."}
{"text":"What an absolute trash Hungry Howie's this is. I used to love your pizza but every single time I order from this location, you guys screw up my order. When I call to complain the employees act inconvenienced and completely rude, as if I should just have happily accepted what I received in error. On top of that, the employees look so unhygienic that it makes me feel gross to eat the food they're preparing and delivering. Hungry Howie's used to be my go to pizza delivery spot but because of how awful this location is I refuse to order from you guys anymore."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! good Howie bread 2!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up 4 pizzas  and breadsticks for family get together. Pizza were hot and crust was delicious .
Love this place for the variety of pizza and crust flavors. Got a great deal with coupons on the website."}
{"text":"Annoyed. Ordered our food at 7:27 PM on a Sunday, confirmation email said it would take 40 minutes. Called the location 3 times and no one answered. 1 hour after we ordered, I received another email saying that the driver was on his way. We just received our order at 8:42 PM. We said something to the driver and he said \"We're really busy right now. We need more drivers.\""}
{"text":"This is some darn good delivery pizza, in the face of comprable competition like pizza hut or domnioe's.
hidden in a tiny strip mall off of lemon and terrace, you can pick up a pie for only $5 on Tuesdays. They actually run a special every weekday, just call and ask what it is -they do require you pick up for the specials though.
the best part about this pizza is that you can get flavored crust for no additional charge. like butter and garlic, sesame seed, etc.
it's a thinner crust style, similar to dominoe's but much more tasty."}
{"text":"Thumbs down. This pizza is expensive if you add just a few more toppings. I gave it 1 star because of its thin crust which is my preference."}
{"text":"Great price and nice Howie rolls. My son and I were hungry while waiting for our tire to be fixed. There was a Hungry Howie's and had a coupon. We ordered a pepperoni Howie Roll and a marinated chicken Howie Roll plus a 20 oz soda. It was a buy one get one free offer. We enjoyed our yummy meal with dipping sauce. Son had marinara. I had Buffalo sauce. It was a hot meal for a great price. $6."}
{"text":"The BEST thing on their menu is their \"calzones\". Specifically the sandwich ones, Italian and Turkey club are my and my sons favorites!!! 
I recommend the thin crust pizza, the flavored crusts are a nice touch. My husband loves the howie bread."}
{"text":"Rudest pizza place in town don't waste your time. Tried to order twice and they were too busy to care about my order"}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's certainly redeemed themselves in my book. Got a medium cheese pizza (extra cheese, add pepperoni, and 4x ranch crust seasoning with extra ranch seasoning on the side) and it came out Perfect. Was amazing, and finally got a sufficient amount of ranch seasoning. My boyfriend said his steak and cheese calzone was good also, and this time it did have lettuce and tomato on the side. Delivered  within the time estimated, and the delivery driver was very friendly and considerate. Good job Hungry Howie's!"}
{"text":"I received two free pizzas from a previous negative experience from a different location. Very nice of Paula to write me a personal message and send vouchers. 

This location is fast friendly and no problems at all. Pizza is hot and delicious! The gentlemen on the phone and delivery drivers are awesome. 

Thank you Paula , I am a fan again :)"}
{"text":"Just received cold pizza and under cooked bread sticks. When we called to let them know we were disappointed , reply was \" well that doesn't make sense\" 

Also we requested red pepper flakes- and when we mentioned on the phone to the same guy , his reply \" we loose money sending them with pizza\" 


We will be going on Howiedoing.com to give another complaint. 

Our office will not call or order from you again!"}
{"text":"When ordered online thet said they wait for a large pizza would be 40 mins. Over an hour later after the 40 minute mark the pizza came cold. When the pizza boy came to the door he said \"yeah im not sure what happened sorry about the wait\" then left. Not impressed."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from here, it was great. The pizza arrived on time and was hot and fresh.  Today, a much different story.  After it was 15 minutes past the time they said it would be here, I called to find out the status.  They said it was out for delivery and would arrive any minute.  15 minutes later, it did come and it was cold.  We had to put it in the microwave to heat it up.  I won't be ordering from here again any time soon.  Maybe it is better if you call in and pick it up??  I won't be taking my chances on either option. Honestly pretty disappointed after having such a great first experience."}
{"text":"The food is not good. 
I ordered from here based on the reviews on another site. I would not order this again the food tastes old and is super Greasy I ordered chicken pizza. It's mostly fatty and flat out didn't taste good.  97% of this meal will go in the trash. 
Guess Oscar the grouch will be getting free lunch on me."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza/movie night.  They beat ANY carry-out and delivery pizza chain in price and taste.
Their pizza is really good, and I love their flavored crusts. We always order online, as they seem to have the best deals.  Online takes an extra few minutes than going in person, but with technology today, I just time it.
I will agree, their boneless wings aren't the best, but I don't come here for wings. I come here for pizza.  The bone-in wings are pretty decent.  Sandwiches are good too!"}
{"text":"Had this place cater our luncheon at the corporate office I work at and I really enjoyed it. So I decided to order it for myself to get a final opinion. The pizza is very good and lots of customization for each half of the pizza and the curst. The wings are about average but it is a pizza joint not a B Dubs. They also are very good about time. In both cases the times they said they would be there they were right on time. I recommend this place & can't wait to try a calzone next!"}
{"text":"shout out to hungry howies on lemon! we brought in canes and asked them to put it on a cheese pizza and they did. best pizza ive ever had in my life."}
{"text":"It takes a lot, and I mean \"a lot\" to trigger me and upset me. After coming to this establishment 3 times a week for 4 months straight, I tonight dealt with Justin \"the area manager\" which in my profession as a manager myself directing my employees to success this man does the complete opposite. He is An egotistical, chauvinistic, inconsiderate, disrespectful employee I am so saddened to see work for my favorite quick grab a bite and go business. I will now drive all the way across town to seek out my favorites again. So here's what happened, which I will be contacting corporate. I ordered a pizza a few nights prior and I asked for it to be lightly done due to the previous pizza being hard to chew. Well as I understand things happen and you can't always determine if something is raw I said ok, bad night I guess. Well I called to notify them that I would be returning the pizza and coming back. I was then told ma'am I can credit your account no need to come back, your in here atleast a few times a week, don't worry about it. So as I proceeded to not eat the pizza we grabbed Panda Express since we were starving. \"Not expecting our pizza to be inedible.\" So I call 2 days later saying I would like to give it one more try after many failed attempts at getting my order correct but still love the food. Out of the 111 orders in 4 months from them after checking my bank statements I had called in 3 times. I was then answered with a rude and arrogant tone like I was trying to get free food! Are you f kidding me!!??? I spend half my paycheck here! How dare you! Anyways back to the story he proceeded to tell me nothing I can do, \"we don't care\" you can buy a pizza but I've dealt with you many times and you always complain. Right..... because I ask for extra butter and parm and say idc what the cost is. But I'm so picky right? Lmfao. Ok, loosing track here of the moral of the story if your still reading. I have NEVER and I honestly mean NEVER have I felt so Repulsed, and DISRESPECTED, in my entire life. I don't allow any man to speak to me like that and it sure as hell won't be from a business taking my money and not fixing what was f-ed up in the first place. I feel so sorry for you son, you'll never get anywhere treating customers like they don't matter because they're what paying your bills and I will be contacting corporate but you said you didn't care anyways go ahead, they don't scare you, your the manager of the store big boss you. Have a great day and god bless you, I'm so sorry for the person who ever made  you such a rude, mean, and vindictive person"}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's satiates that pizza craving for less G's than Papa Johns or Pizza Hut and is marginally more satisfying than Little Caesars.   I was full and content, but not overly impressed.

Hungry Howies drew me in with cheap pizza deals.  On Wednesdays, you can get 3 one-topping pizzas from $5 a pie, so I figured \"Why Not?\".  When I got there, the place was packed and the staff were understandably taxed by all the orders.  Good peeps, though.  The crust was...well, spongy for a lack of a better word.  Not crispy, but kinda chewy.  The chewiness was exacerbated by warming up leftovers the next  day (no, I didn't eat all three in one day).  The cheese and the sauce tasted fresh and the toppings had atleast some flavor.

Overall, not a bad place to get pizzas from your workplace or groups of people that you nominally like.  I can't stay that my pizza craving won't sway me back if I happen to be in this shopping center, starving, and get a whiff of baking pizza.  My pizza craving doesn't discriminate...."}
{"text":"Let start by saying, I am a general manager of a neighboring pizza place. Now customer service is one thing I completely strive for in my restaurant, And I have so many regulars that walk through my door. Along with new customers every single day. 

But, I'm not here to tell you about how amazing my pizza place is. I have ordered many times from hungry howies, and it's always been an average experience. Not the greatest, and certainly not the worst. Until this last order. The delivery guy was pleasant, forgot my soda, but not horrible. Now when I called back to the store to let them know, the gentleman that answered told me the manager was busy, and he would be a few minutes. So I waited. Not for long, but long enough that I heard them joking, laughing, and then he answers, and I didn't catch his name. However when I told him my pizza was just delivered, and they forgot the soda he stumbled over his words to find my order, which ironically without telling him my address, he knew it right off the bat. He told me I did not order a soda. Which was a shock to me since I was looking at my receipt, and on the line it said \"2L pepsi.. $2.59\". So of course I let him know, and he finally agreed with me, after telling me he was looking at a previous order of mine.... anyway the soda was brought to me. Finished eating saved the rest of the pizza for left overs.(obviously didn't eat alot of it)

That would of been the end of it, and I would not be here now telling you my experience. But I woke up, grabbed a slice of pizza, and went on my way. After a bite or two, I just happened to look down at my pizza, and there is was with a tiny layer of cheese over it. A dead fly. Yes, accidents happen. I'm sorry It's not a small fly, if I could share the picture with you I would. And I didn't order anything crazy, I order chicken, tomatoes, and cheese. So how can NOBODY notice a black fly on the pizza??

Now I know what your going to say, \"you didn't even notice it\" but, I shouldn't have to look for bugs in my food. You are a food place, you should be looking for that stuff, throwing it out, and remaking it. Because where I work, we don't let customers have this bad of experience. And when our customers call back  with any problems we handle them, and not by telling them they are wrong."}
{"text":"Eh pizza is alright. Not a crazy fan of but it could also be because they took AN HOUR to deliver when we are 5 mins away."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes great. My first time at this location as I usually go to the one in Indian Trail. Same great tasting pizza, but the employees at this location don't seem to like to use latex gloves, preferring to use their bare hands instead. I have a huge problem with that. I don't know where your hands have been. I was really hungry and really tired after a long day. I will come back again and I will point this out. They need to fix this  or lose at least one customer. Would have had more stars except for this problem."}
{"text":"So back in my younger (drunken) days I would order from this hungry howies multiple times a week and had zero problems ever. So when about a month ago I found myself drunk and hungry at 2 am I decided to use hungry howies once again. I ordered 1 medium peperoni pizza. the 45 minute wait turned into an hour and I called back sine I knew they would be closing soon. \"uh it says here it was delivered\" \"Well I don't have a pizza so\"  at this point he puts the driver on the phone \"I rang the door bell a few times, no one answered so I left it in front of the door\" \"not at my house\" \"ok I'll be right there\" I lived on a number street he left it at the same address on the wrong street. 5 after we got off the phone he brought me the cold pizza he had left for a half hour in front of a strangers house.  It was late, I was drunk and hungry so I ate it. That's my shame I'll have to live with for the rest of my life. So all I can do now is tell you this place is staffed by a selection of Arizona's Finest Idiots who I can only hope were drunk or high that night. I won't be ordering from them again  and if you want food delivered to your house late night I would suggest you look elsewhere , or if you must order from here make sure you call them every 15 minutes and make them read your address to you. 

Also the pizza is average at best."}
{"text":"Had hungry howies twice and this is really really good pizza for the price.  Out of all the places that deliver in Tempe I think this Is the best. Love their crust- we get the butter cheese and its delicious!  The price is really good and they deliver quickly."}
{"text":"Wow! The garlic flavored crust pizza we ordered was DELICIOUS! I was pleasantly surprised, as the price was so cheap I wasn't sure how the quality would be. Honestly, the best pizza I've had since moving to Arizona in 2007!"}
{"text":"Pizza sauces doesn't really have much flavor and the add crust toppings is nothing exciting for the price you pay."}
{"text":"We were in the middle of a very long drive from Arizona to Reno. We were hungry for pizza. We stopped here and split a delicious 1/2 pepperoni/ 1/2 combination. It was good, but here's why I'm writing this review:  we got about 50 miles up 95 and realized my purse wasn't in the car. My phone was in the purse so I couldn't call to find out if I'd left it at Hungry Howie's. We had to turn around and go 50 miles back. My purse was safely held in their office with the phone and cash totally intact. I offered the young man who served me a $20 tip for taking care of my purse. He wouldn't take it. I persisted. He kept saying no very nicely. All I have to say is thank you for the good pizza AND for being honest!"}
{"text":"Tell us more about your experience:

I told my kids ill buy them pizza and they chose Hungry Howies. Tried to order through GrubHub but when I put the pizza in cart it kept saying I have one more thing to pick before it would let me continue with my order. 
For some reason the app had me put an order of wings in the cart. I had 2 choices, 10 of 20 wings. I had been hungry for wings for a while so I thought I'll get an order of 10 even though I was not happy that the app was forcing me to get wings and I didn't click on any discounts, it was all at regular menu price. When my order came in I got  something looking like chicken nuggets. I hate chicken nuggets. I called and complained. WAs told these were boneless wings. The flavorless things taste nothing like wings. I would not it them, I was expecting regular hot wings. After being on the phone with GrubHub  for about an hour ( they were contacting the restaurant) they said there's nothing they can do. Really?? They sent a wrong item. Finally had them agree that if I go there and bring the old wings back they will exchange them for the correct ones. I drove there but the wings weren't ready, had to go get food somewhere else as about two hours have passed since the order was placed. Still have the \"boneless wings\", no one in my house would eat them, except maybe the dogs.

{"text":"This place is beyond awesome!!! We placed an order to introduce some friends to the deliciousness that is Hungry Howie's and they messed up our order...

With that said... they admitted their mistake and not only made us a new pizza, but refunded us the cost of the pizza for our inconvenience!  I have never had service quite like this and will continue to recommend them to ANYONE who wants to try something outside the standard 3.  And if you like buffalo chicken you have got to try their buffalo chicken pizza with ranch crust! It's Epicness in a pizza!"}
{"text":"They're a step above places like Pizza Hut and Domino's, but by no means the pinnacle if pizza pies.

I do like that you can request cajun seasoning on the crust."}
{"text":"Ordered through yelp eats24.  It was supposed to be delivered in 20 to 45 minutes.   Waited 2 hours.  Contacted eats24 to see where my order is.  After 10 minutes they said they were on hold. They asked if I wanted them to check again.  I said YES!  they said I would have it in 45 minutes.   Already waited over 2 Hours.  Contacted them AGAIN.  After being on hold for 7 more minutes was told I should get it in about 15 more minutes by manager Blake.  Not worth the aggravation.   Never again.  Plenty of good pizza places around."}
{"text":"When you look up terrible in the dictionary, all it'll say is \"Hungry Howie's\". When I called and ordered a pizza for delivery I was greeted by someone who seemed like they hated their life, this should have foreshadowed what was to come. Delivery took an hour and when I finally received my pizza, honestly, I was nothing short of disgusted. It was almost black, extremely burnt. It was missing components I asked for.... like oh, I don't know, cheese and sauce? But who knows, it probably just evaporated from the extreme hell fire this pizza was placed in. It was not at all edible so naturally, I wanted my money back. I called back and again was greeted by a human seemingly in misery. I was very polite in explaining the situation and as he just repeated back my order and asked if that's indeed what I ordered, I said yes and he preceded to tell me to have a great day and hung up on me. I called back and was berated with even more rudeness, him talking over me and not letting me speak. I asked to speak to the manager, which turned out to also be a mistake. Yes, he told me my money would be returned (which I honestly doubt) and then assured me extremely sarcastically that his employee would lose his job over this. To sum it up, there is no hope for the employees at this specific location as they do not care about you, your pizza, or your time. As an avid hungry Howie fan, I will never order from this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"I love Hungry Howies Food but I have YET to have an order from this location correct. I will literally have 3 items and they still seem to get it wrong. I placed a picture of my receipt in the photos . 3 items . 1 med cheese pizza and 2 howie rolls well done. They are suppose to come with dipping sauce and mine didn't.They always undercook them. Last time I ordered one they had to resend one out and it was really good when they made it right(or the way I like it, sorry if I like cooked dough)  there was no dipping sauce either.  None at all. So I called and they said they would give me credit for a howie roll. Really cause in all actuality we trashed both Howies rolls...both were undercooked which I explained to the girl plus we didn't get the dipping sauce and the cheese pizza wasn't for us it was for my grandpa. So the money to Howies plus tip goes in the trash and so does the dinner I thought we were having, PLUS wee are still hungry , looks like cereal for us after all EPIC FAIL HUNGRY HOWIES. And if u look up our account, u will see u always screw up. And I'm always very nice about it, I've never been rude or not understanding, but enough is enough. One time I would like to get my order right, and get what I paid for. And at least have my food cooked."}
{"text":"First time I have ordered pizza from this company and it will be my last delivery took an hour pizza was deliver ice cold call the location and spoke with the store manager Tanner he refused to take responsibility for the situation offered 3.00 item free on my next order adv I'm not ever ordering from hungry Howies again and requested my money back he came up with every possible excuse not to refund my money from we can't issues credits to we are having a issue with our processing company. Well I work for a bank (credit card decision) any merchant that accepts credit cards have to be able issue a refund (credit) so excuse #1 a lie next having issues with the credit card processing company possible true however you can manually issue a credit lie #2 in the end he refused to give me my money back he did give me the corporate number will call them tomorrow. How people like him get to run a store I have no idea also now I have stomach issues from the pizza so who knows how long it was really sitting around will not order a pizza from hungry Howies again"}
{"text":"As I'm waiting for my pizza some long haired delivery driver came in yelling at a poor girl saying she has no clue how to do her job. He really shouldn't be acting like this especially in front of a customer. And to top it all off I've been waiting for ever. When I fist arrived they said it's coming out right then. I'm still waiting, it's been 15min since they said it's coming right out of the oven now."}
{"text":"not a thing from his place is fresh all frozen. supermarket pizzas are more  likely to be better. if you don't make your own dough, daily,  you should not be in the pizza business!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ran by a bunch of incompetent uneducated people who can not even read orders or receipts I have waited 25 minutes after it was told to me
That I had to wait 6 for a medium pizza because one of the drivers apparently took my pizza. They
Also forgot my sauces and told me it was never in the order. Worst Hungry Howies in Arizona by far. I'd rather drive to the one in Tempe"}
{"text":"I pre-ordered the pizza to be delivered for a school pizza party. I obviously cannot leave school because I am responsible for students. I received a call at delivery time that there was no driver to bring me my pizza, and had over 20 kids waiting for their lunch. I will not be ordering from Hungry Howie's again due to their unreliability."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because the last two times I've ordered from this place it's been a nightmare! The first time we ordered online and after an hour called and was told their system was down and someone would be in touch with us.  We called again after another hour and they had no record of our order.

The second time we ordered the pizza was wrong and they told me they would send us a new pizza. They called me back and told me to give the driver the pizza that they made the mistake on. The driver shows up and asks to see the pizza and says \"hang on I need to call my manager.\" Meanwhile he's outside our house with our pizza smoking a cigarette! I'm so disgusted by this place that I will never order from here again!!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why the pie is cheap. Ate here twice and got sick both times. Spend the extra dough and go down the street or your toilet bowl will become your 2 day seat..... Woof"}
{"text":"Damn, I love Howie's greasy pizza. When I realized that the only Hungry Howie's in Vegas is not far from my house, I figured that I should see if the pizza still tastes like I remember from Florida. It doesn't hurt that they offer great deals, and around 8 different flavors for the crust. That's right, no boring, discardable pizza crust at Howie's! While the pizza and ranch-seasoned crust combo was already quite salty, I saw feta cheese offered as a topping and thought, why not? Next time, I may even add some vegetables to the mix. We're not talking about health food here.

If you're still eating Little Caesar's or some other generic takeout pizza, you're missing out on some great munchies."}
{"text":"Fast, delivered to hotel no problem, really friendly delivery gal  , order as ordered. Only slight disappointment was that the thin crust pizza wasn't cut all the way through the crust. Since we were in a hotel we didn't have the regular utensils at our disposal. But, not the end of the world."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Hungry Howies in over 10 years. I just moved here and saw this place not even a mile from my house. I was giddy like a school girl! I'm so glad they haven't changed over the years. Pizza is still JUST as delis!h! I love the different flavored crusts. Cajun is my fav!"}
{"text":"Great price, solid pizza, and late hours. What more could you ask for when you're looking for some grub after the bars!"}
{"text":"I had a great relationship with this particular Howie's store until a couple of weeks back, when I got a call from the manager informing me that his driver could not deliver to my area.  I explained to him that I had ordered from his store several times and the drivers always delivered it to me without any problem.  In fact, the Howie's website lists his store as the Howie's that is supposed to service my part of town.  He simply said that he couldn't help me and refunded my money (I had already placed the order and was waiting for my pizza for an hour.  The manager said he tried to call but apparently the low rent employee who took my order wrote down my number incorrectly.)  I love Howie's pizza but this particular store is clueless.  Don't depend on them for anything."}
{"text":"If you are drunk and/or a poor college student this place is perfect. For $5 you get a large pizza. Said pizza is edible. You can't really beat that.

I was unaware that they have flavored crusts. I look forward to trying these next time.

Its super close to my place so I just swoop by and pick it up, thus avoiding a delivery tragedy."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! So hubby calls and has the order taker double check and make sure they have gluten free (severe allergy) . Yes they do. So he places order hangs up and a while later he gets a call , they do not have gluten free and our bank card has already been charged! So we are out $48,for 5-7 days!!! For some people that could be their last dollar and they would still be hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good for me. I am kind of obsessed with the breadsticks and the flavored crusts are delicious too. I like to mix and match the flavors which is awesome. Every time I walk in this place is super friendly and very clean and I like that. Big fan of this place."}
{"text":"I've been craving breadsticks since I picked up some from Target. (Pizzahut breadsticks) (they're so good!)
Anyways ,So this is right by where we live, I ordered the howie bread. 
It's so chewy,not like jets doughy that you can actually chew , this is like chewing a piece of rubber. 
Whatever seasoning they put on top it has no flavor whatsoever with a hint of bitter.
I couldn't eat it after the first piece.
Bland $5 of waste!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza that offers both delivery and carryout. Much better than most of the other chain pizza restaurants; I despise Papa John's, Pizza Hut, etc., but Hungry Howie's is a great place to get some tasty food."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and hoagie selection. I wouldn't choose this first but if it's late and other places are closed....it's a pretty good meal. 

Employees are very nice and friendly. Place is clean at the storefront. 

I like their idea of flavored crust.

Give it a try - you may like it better than I do."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok nothing special but for a chain it's worth trying."}
{"text":"We really like the pizza, and I've ordered it onsite and picked it up each time (3).
We did not get the $5 special, but ordered off the regular menu.
The pizza is good especially the crusts you can self-select.
There is a lot of crust around the outer edge, probably 25% of the volume of the pizza--they do not distribute it evenly.  You can order breadsticks if you want this much crust without toppings.  It needs more consistent coverage of whole pizze, not the center 2/3 only.  Sometimes no one is up front or acknowledges you.  They seem to be out back smoking or socializing , or something.  Mostly good service and we like the pizza."}
{"text":"-stars the delivery guys took over 2 hours and they did not have a good reason on why they were late never again will I order from here"}
{"text":"ordered a pizza right now which was supposed to be here by 5:30pm. it's now 6:30 and I'm calling for the 2nd time and have been on hold for almost 10 mins! Everytime i have ordered from this location, they have been 10mins early. but tonight, when my daughter is throwing a fit cause she is hungry, they are no where to be found. Ummmmmmmm, yah I'm not paying for a pizza that's 1hr+ late. and dont bother to offer me coupon's for next time, cause there will NOT be a next time. get your shit together and hire all new people!!!!"}
{"text":"We have tried this place a couple times and have always had okay service until today. We placed a future order to be ready for pick up \"around a certain time\" not one hour after and forget the cinnamon bread and one of the toppings. Absolutely horrible customer service when we got there as well. Very displeased and will making sure and letting my niebors know."}
{"text":"We are having a 16th birthday Party for my daughter on Saturday and will be picking up 20 pizzas Tina was extremely helpful with the prices. Give her a call for your next party!"}
{"text":"I am all about service and the gentleman that helped me tonight needs a course in customer service. I walked in to make an order and he made me feel as though I was inconveniencing him! In fact he kept throwing kitchen supplies in the back and when he hung up the phone with a customer before me he slammed the phone down. Even more alarming was after I have him my order he threw the pen I used at the register. I get we all have bad days and it looks like he was short staffed-- didn't see anyone else in the back- but geez cool your jets in front of customers. 
Service aside the pizza is decent and I love the Howie Maui."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza last Sunday night.  We were quoted 30 minutes but the pizza never showed up so we called and they seemed to have no idea we even ordered a pizza.   so we had to tell them what we ordered and then they said oh yea we think it should be on its way.  30 minutes later it showed up.  The pizza guy handed my girlfriend the bag to her so she set it down paid for the pizza, then had to reach down a pull the pizza out herself.  The pizza  along with all the toppings was all slid to one corner as if he carried it sideways, also we didn't receive and sauce for our bread sticks that we ordered.  I Definitely do not recommend this place unless you love the crust that much! I'll post the picture."}
{"text":"I only have 1 start because I cant give zero. On 3 occasions I received service so bad I thought it was a practical joke. I asked the employee 3 times why they didn't take coupons and his answers were \"cause, cause we dont, and cause I said so\" ...wow.   when I did get the order it was completely wrong on all 3 occasions.  Hungry howies you are THE worst."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience with their pizza, I would definitely order more if I was in the mood for pizza more often, garlic crust is my favorite.

The only thing I hate about them is the location, nothing more sketchy than lemon street but I try to order during the day

Edit: I ordered 2 more times after my first review. One pizza was mushroom and pepperoni and had a few short hairs in it. The second time I ordered it was very cold and again had some hair in it, pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite pizza places. I live in fairport harbor and they actually deliver this far. Where other pizza places have jurisdictions and only go so far. This place is also open a bit later than others. Their pizza is delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I live close to this Hungry Howie's and had never been in over five years...I know know that I wasn't missing out on much. Ordered some pizzas for work today, thinking that there would be a $6 promo. My colleague gave me the little slip but failed to mention it had the dreaded \"*\" which stated that you needed to order 3 pizzas for that price. Somehow I managed to get two pizzas that cost me more than perhaps only a gourmet pizzeria in town. Total was $21 dollars (without tipping) for just one cheese and a pepperoni pizza. The quality was equal if not worse than the neary by Little Caesar's where their \"Hot'n ready\" pizzas are a much better value at $5. Not impressed by the flavor or quality and especially not the cost. I gave it two because I'd still eat it...if someone else is buying."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Hands down the worst sandwiches I've had. They were so soggy I couldn't pick it up to eat it. I would hardly call it presentable. All it basically was made of us pizza bread, a crap ton of cheese, a couple slices of turkey, one leaf of lettuce, and one slice of tomato. Not to mention I ordered a turkey sandwich and they threw a bunch of ham on there. I do not eat pork. The sandwich was completely ruined. I checked the receipt and no where on it did it say to add ham. We will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"It's ok. 

I would rather get something else but my boyfriend and his friend have a weird obsession of coming here instead of ordering first. It's not really a big deal till the sun goes down. Then the local college crackheads come out to play. 

The area is pretty sketchy in my opinion and having some cracked out guy talk my ear off while the stoned employees take their time on my pizza is not an ideal Friday night... well it could be for some people. 

The music is kinda loud in the establishment so prepare to have to talk louder then normal to get your order semi right. 

I had hungry howies deliverd to my place once. I told the delivery driver to keep the change (was like $5 tip) and he said wow in such a way that I thought he was expecting a bigger tip. 

Anyways, I like the howie rolls and the cheese, sausage and green pepper pizza. But when in doubt, if its 2am and your stoned and hungry, just have them deliver it to you instead of waiting with the crackheads at the store."}
{"text":"Just.ordered this pizza can't.even.eat this sloppy greasy mess I love pizza and wanted to.try it but what the F plz look at the picture I posted come on guys get it together I am not just some person having a bad day and thought I would slam you but I had to.throw a whole pizza out because it needed a straw to eat because of the pool of sauce and I like sauce"}
{"text":"Tried HH again to see if they could improve upon last visit. It got worse. The pizza is always fine: great crusts, good selection of toppings, good prices. The service at this location is horrendous. 

I ordered two pizzas online, 15 minutes after they opened and it said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I knew better, so I showed up after 30 minutes and they still weren't ready. After waiting another 10 minutes, she tells me that they made the wrong pizza. I had ordered a two-topping pizza plus the special two-topping pizza, which gives $1 to the Children's Hospital. They made a regular pepperoni instead of the special. 

She said I could either wait another 20 minutes for a new one (and let my other pizza get cold) or take the one topping pizza for the two topping price. Plus the hospital doesn't get the donation.  Unbelievable. 

Avoid this location. I have been here twice. Two different crews, same results both times- rip off."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  Do not order from this location. Delivery is late, pizza is cold and they are always to \"busy\" to offer any good service."}
{"text":"Flavored crust!  Need I say more? 
Now with that being said, the pizza itself is okay at best.  Eatable, but won't blow your socks off.
The crust, though? Wish I could order just that over and over!"}
{"text":"OUT OF BUSINESS...Even less pizza options in the far west valley (west of the Agua Fria River)...so angry.  I always enjoyed Hungry Howie's, and now the closest one is about 13 miles away at 107th Ave & Lower Buckeye.  I will say the last time I was at this location in April, they gave me a hassle for using a birthday coupon that said Tempe on it.  They scolded me saying that I needed to go online and change it to their location, but they will accept it this one time.  Even though, I didn't appreciate how they acted; I still didn't want them to go out of business!"}
{"text":"I usually go here to either get the calzone or the pizza because they do a good job preparing it. But last week, I had a terrible experience. I asked for a medium size buffalo chicken pizza. The young woman who prepared the pizza mixed both the buffalo chicken and the bbq sauce and gave it to me as if I wouldn't have known. She had added more bbq sauce than the buffalo one. I knew this even before opening the box because the mixture of the two sauces smelled gross but it smelled more like bbq. I politely requested that I wanted a buffalo chicken pizza to which she replied \"Do you want me to make another one?\". Of course woman! You cannot mix both bbq and buffalo sauce for a pizza. It smells gross. Five minutes later she comes out with the what I wanted but this one is drenched in buffalo sauce. So much, that my brother and I could not hold it in our mouths, let alone chew and swallow it."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I ordered from this place one night pretty late maybe about 1:30, after about a little over an hour I still didnt receive my pizza, so I called the store and they had the driver call me back, I stated my address as clear as possible, \"SOUTHERN AVE\" and this genius delivered to \"7th avenue\" really? why the hell would anyone order from somewhere that far away? Never got my pizza because they were closed by than, did I forget to mention that they had charged my card for it too? never ordering from this rat hole again."}
{"text":"That is the last time I go in there. The first time I had a punk tried to rub himself on me and steal my wallet right out of my hand. This time a girl dropping thr F bomb every other word was threatening to fight me after I turned my back on her. Both times in front of my little girl! You either shut this place down or have a cop in there at night!!  You think this really deserves a star???"}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix where there is hungry howies every where. When I saw it I had to order and the flavored crust was as good as I remember. Definitely recommend if your a crust person!"}
{"text":"I understand it's a Friday night but worst pizza ever. It took over an hour for it to get to me, not only did I pay $30 for some pizza but I tip the delivery guy $10. The pizza was cold chewy unacceptable!! Go with dominos or Pizza Hut much better. They can't even show up on time or give you warm pizza unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's is to great pizza what Bud Light is to craft beer.

In the interest of full disclosure, I rarely eat Hungry Howie's while I'm sober. In fact, as the beer in me increases, so too does the likelihood that I'll say \"Yes, I would like to forgo all the other great pizza joints in town for Hungry Howie's, because I'd like some Three Cheese Howie Bread.\"

And therein lies the problem. One item on the menu reduces me to a quivering pile of jelly. For just a few dollars, I can innundate my stomach with something cheesy, garlicky and greasy, all in one bite. These are the best cheesy breadsticks in town, and like Pringles, once you pop, you can't stop. If they put toppings on this, this review would get four stars, and my belt would need four more notches. 

The pizza? If you remember Little Caesar's from the 80's, where you'd get two pizzas covered by a thin piece of paper then you've had Howie's pizza. What sets it apart is the flavored crust, which is one of my favorite parts of the pie. If it was stuffed crust, this review would get five stars, and my shirt size would need five X's instead of two.

There's a ton of better pizza in Lakewood. But, there isn't a better cheesy breadstick, guaranteed. You should order Howies if you're drunk, have kids that like mediocre pizza, or don't have a ton of money.

Otherwise? There's lots better out there."}
{"text":"This is my pizza delivery place when I need something QUICK and reliable.  I love all their flavored crusts and the baked subs are delicious.  This isn't spectacular pizza that is going to change your life, but it is tasty and they deliver FAST and we have never had an order be incorrect.  Try the garlic crust, yum."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery yesterday. It took an hour but it was Saturday night. The delivery driver was soo nice. The buffalo pizza was pretty good. Lots of sauce. The deep dish crust is really crunchy. My kids liked the pepperoni pizzas. The wings could have been cooked a little longer. We will have it again."}
{"text":"Good prices and really tasty pizza's. I was really impressed with the butter cheese crust, very tasty and the cheese was really stringy and laid on thick."}
{"text":"I had to update this review...
So, at about 9pm we got our brownie. About 49 mins after posting the review below. We placed the order at 6:15pm. So almost 3 hours later our order was completed. Better late than never???...I gave them another star for the effort. 

I don't like giving bad reviews, however, I keep trying to give this place a chance and they consistently mess things up. We are never happy with our orders from here, they are always wrong wrong wrong. Today was no exception. 

We ordered over $15 and expected a brownie. NO BROWNIE. Even worse was that they told us they would bring it and they never did. I probably wouldn't have written anything, but lying really makes me upset. If you mess up and say you're gonna do something, don it. Not to mention our order wasn't even started over an hour after placing it. 

Order from just about anywhere else. Most of the reviews here are pretty accurate with regards to customer service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Hungry Howie's Pizzas around the valley, and this location honestly feels like a completely different company since their quality and taste is MUCH better than any others. 

Big fan here.  Thanks for actually understanding what \"Extra Cheese\" means.  =)"}
{"text":"My neighbors stole the pizza that my son ordered.  The manager could not have been nicer and is giving us a free pizza.  THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"I was at a party and we wanted to order pizza, so we made 2 separate orders to pay with 2 different cards. Both pizzas came at the same time from the same driver. Each person was charged a delivery fee. I called them to tell them what happened and they couldn't refund my delivery fee. Ended up paying $14 for their $5.99 pizza."}
{"text":"Love the flavored crust options but not so much love is given to the rest of the place. I ordered online through Yelp and yet when I arrived to pick up my order, there was nothing made because they did not even get my order. What a disappointment because it was very convenient to use the Yelp app for ordering. Won't try this again. Make sure you call the pizza in don't trust them to get it online."}
{"text":"A large pepperoni pizza was only about $6.50 with tax??? When the kid gave me the total I thought it was going to horrible, but it was surprisingly good. I ordered it with a parmigiana crust. When the word gets out they are going to destroy Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great pizza!!! Will go back alot!  Fast delivery or pick up and always smiling . Brandi is very sweet."}
{"text":"Not good service and didn't try to make me come back. I'll get Genos . Sorry  just can not make myself go back and try it. It is not busy so I would say more people feel the same way."}
{"text":"Meh.  It's cheap pizza, and I guess it's better than Little Caesars.  There's nothing outstanding about the quality, but it's not terrible.  If you need cheep eats, though, it's good enough."}
{"text":"Good pizza but I came in the store and no one in the kitchen was wearing a hat or gloves."}
{"text":"Fast. Tasty. Friendly. Yummy. 

Can't go wrong and they are a great late night option. Always helpful especially when we are working on renos at the house! 

Standard pizza joint but will share the wings are great!"}
{"text":"Ordered online at work to pick up on the way home, ordered at 3pm and stated to have ready by 6pm. I showed up at 6pm on the dot, waited at the register for 5 minutes until someone walked by and said they would be right with me. Waited another ten minutes and someone finally came to the register. Told him I had a 6pm pickup, he looked confused and said it would be right out. During my long visit I could hear pans falling, employees arguing and complaining. Employees looked dazed and confused and there is absolutely no leadership. at 6:43 I finally got my pizza, that's right 43 minutes standing in a hot store. 

I only gave two stars because he did offer to refund my order

This was my first and last visit to Hungry Howies"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here for years, but with much less frequency the last few years. The service has gotten really bad, as it shouldn't be this difficult to order a pizza. Website wouldn't accept my address this time, the same address as last time. Was on hold for 15 minutes. Hung up, called back then was on hold another 15 minutes before I hung up and ended the joke...

Good thing there are so many other pizza options nearby."}
{"text":"I love them! Do they ever close? Every time I call they are open, 2am or new years day! :-) 

The garlic crust pizza is my fave!"}
{"text":"*****Update!***** Ok, so since I had such a decent experience the other night, I decided to give this place a try again. Big mistake. I made the order online and when I got to the store, they said it would be about 2 more minutes. I waited inside the store, browsed Facebook, checked my email, and then realized 15 min later that I was still waiting. Amongst this time, I hear one of the male workers saying \"holy shit\" 13 times (at some point, I started counting because I couldn't believe how unprofessional they were being, with a customer in the store nonetheless). Finally, a sweet girl comes to the counter and asks if I was waiting for a pizza. Uhhhh yeah, for the last 15 minutes! She pulls it out of the little warmer box! What was I waiting for??! To add insult to injury, the pizza tasted like hell this time. Wayyyyyy too much cheese and the crust was way thicker than the first time I ordered from here. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered through YELP and my credit card was charged and then I was notified that my order was on it's way and would be delivered by 12:15. I had a meeting and looked at my phone and they said they had no drivers.  They will now reverse the charges but I won't see that for 24 hours.  I don't think they should be able to charge your card if they can't fulfill the commitment. No more ordering through YELP."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good-especially for the price but the customer service is terrible. Every time. They now have an automated system that tells their specials but they use to seemed annoyed when asked. Now they just seem annoyed having to answer the phone."}
{"text":"I ordered gluten free pizza crust and it was the worst pizza I've ever had.  The crust was burned all the way around and crispy as crackers.  I've had gluten free pizza crust from other places and it was never like this.  I understand this is something new but before you claim you have a great gluten pizza crust ask someone who has experienced real good gluten pizza crust.  I make gluten free pizza crust at home and it never has turned out like this crispy burned crust.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I used to eat this pizza once a week at old location on Vegas Valley and Nellis. Thrilled that they opened up one so close to our house on NW Vegas. Butter cheese crust is a must and your doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the thin crust pizza. Truly great pizza. Highly recommend this to friends and family."}
{"text":"I called to order a calzone or calzone style sub and encountered one of the worst customer service experiences of my life.  Though I am sure Kaylin knew what I was trying to order (a pizza calzone special, I was looking at an older menu) she repeatedly acted confused and was rude and indignant.  I have been a longtime customer of this location and that is in serious jeopardy after this experience.  I was put on hold repeatedly, the total call was 7 1/2 minutes and I never ordered due to this treatment.  After the first hold I asked if I could talk to a manager as I thought the employee was new and was not understanding my order.  She informed me she was the only one there, no manager.  After the second or third hold (all the while I was trying to explain I wanted the calzone with pepperoni, ham, peppers, onions, sauce and cheese) I asked her about the manager again, she again responded there was no manager.  I had to ask if there was EVER a manager in the store and what his name was.  She finally told me it was Jose.

The message above is what I sent to Hungry Howies corporate headquarters and I requested that they contact me regarding the issue (it's an option on their complaint form).  That was four weeks ago and I haven't heard from them at all.  Clearly the company does not care about customer service."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan and was excited to have a HH location in Vegas. My family and I were visiting the park nearby and are rarely on this side of town.

Their pizza/ wings gave me an awful food poisoning experience while being 5 months pregnant. Not fun and disappointed!"}
{"text":"Order was all correct, delivery boy was friendly and on time, pizza was good, decent price, will be getting delivery again! Pleasantly surprised for ordering late on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"They use to be amazing, but now every time I go in my Howie roll is burnt. The cheese is barely on there, even though I get extra. This last visit they even put the wrong cheese on and didn't ask what sauce I wanted. They are always understaffed. Never going back, what a shame, they use to be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas and 2 orders of bread sticks online. When it was delivered we realized that the pepperoni pizza was missing the pepperoni. So we sent it back with the driver with him telling us we would get our pizza re delivered. 30 minutes later still no pizza so I had to call. Took another 5 minutes after that. THEN we found out that instead of regular bread(which is the only kind the kids will eat) we got cheesy bread. This will definitely be the last time I order from Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup.  Order was ready when promised when I arrived and extremely hot and fresh from the feeling when my hands held the boxes.  We went with the two med 12\" pizza with a Howie bread (garlic cheese bread) for $15.  

What I enjoyed most about the pizza was the crust. I like the flavor and texture cornmeal can provide on a decent crust.  The crust had a nice crunch to it and was sturdy enough to hold the toppings without sagging.   The sauce was a pretty standard prepackaged just add water pizza chain sauce with a sweet tangy tomato taste.  Cheese and topping distribution was also to be expected from a national pizza chain.  Everything is either weighed or counted to create a consistent pie weather your in Nevada or in Florida.  

What sets this chain apart from Domino's or Pizza Hut was the complimentary crust toppers.  This really adds flavor and complexity to a part of the pizza some do not enjoy.  We had the Asiago which had a great taste as well as the buttery herb which was finger licking good.  

They offer some deals in newspaper mailings that could be perfect for a football party, with pizza and wing combos. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visiting my kid and never had this before as I don't live in Nevada. Excellent pizza for the price. I was expecting Little Cesar's type pizza and was pleasantly surprised at just how much better it was then that. Beats Pappa johns too! Well worth the money and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Friendly service for delivery. The pizza is nothing special. We did not try the flavored crust maybe it would have given the pizza that special touch I was hoping for."}
{"text":"I always get burnt by these guys, but since its the closest pizza spot i keep ordering...I will not be ordering from them again though, too many times i have received sloppy pizza that is  under cooked come, simply pretty gross."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. It's priced pretty well for what you get. Just don't add something to your order. Whenever we add a sauce, we only receive it like 20% of the time. We tried calling in and we offered a $2 credit or for it to be delivered in another 45 mins. No thanks, that feels like an insult. 

We used to order from them a lot and stopped because we werent receiving our whole orders. Then we started again and just have accepted that we won't get all that we pay for."}
{"text":"Dropping to 3 stars for now.  Got a pizza a couple of weeks ago and it was not good.  Very skimpy on the cheese and toppings, crust was slightly burned and hard.  It's nearly impossible to burn a pizza in a conveyor oven, but it can be done if you put too many things in it.  I'll come back and try it soon when I want a ready made pizza, but if it's not good, Papa Murphy's will continue to get my money."}
{"text":"Decided to order due to the buy 1 large get the second for 4 CENTS THROUGH JULY 4th.
We ordered one large pepperoni with cheddar crust well done, and one large with pineapple and sesame crust- normal bake...I'm taking one star off because my pinapple pizza had like 4 pieces of pine on it, and was baked well done even though that is not how i ordered it.All in all though it was worth the deal"}
{"text":"Wow, you missed this one. I really enjoy this place, but today I spend $45. For extra everything and receive a cold lg Reg topped pizza.  I'm very disappointed. Lynn Adkins."}
{"text":"The reviewer who described the pizza as \"tough\" was spot-on. This is literally the worst pizza I have ever had in my entire life. I would rather go hungry than eat Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"Went time hungry howies because i was craving their garlic crust pizza. Got home and my pizza had regular crust! So pissed. Would've went somewhere else with better pizza in general if I wanted regular crust. Also, the guy who took my call rang us up for the wrong price. Got there and the other guy noticed and took 5$ off. I dont like a lot of sauce, but my pizza literally tasted like there wasnt any sauce on it at all. My boyfriend asked for extra sauce on his pizza and he said it didnt seem like they put any extra on. 

Never had a pizza messed up anywhere before last night. I hope they figure this out because I like hungry howies."}
{"text":"Last time I order here. My order seems to take over two hours to deliver... At least it has the last two times I ordered here. They comped my order once and that was nice, but I'd prefer to pay for my pizza and get it warm and under two hours ..."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and was happy. Ordered on line late at night and it was ready when I arrived was nice and hot and tasted good. The cashier was very friendly as well we will order again."}
{"text":"I called to figure out why the promotion online would not work when logged in. First thing that made us frustrated because we spent 25 min following every restriction they had and the promotion still did not work. Finally called to ask why and was hung up on them was put on hold for 3 minutes so we just hung up! I don't want your pizza that bad! It should not have been that difficult so we took our business else where"}
{"text":"I would give it less stars if i could. Worst customer service ever experienced. Called for delivery and the guy didnt pay attention to the order and once he got it, he hung up without asking what type of payment method we were doing and he didnt take the entire order. I called again and told him we were paying with a card and as soon as he took the card number he hung up. I called a third time asking for the manager and she was rude, didnt even apologize for the bad service. Food took like 40 mins to get to us and it wasnt as good."}
{"text":"The most horrific experience ever in an establishments. Gerald the \"General Manager\" is so rude!!! I am saying that nicely as there are other words I have for people like him. He does not know how to talk to customers. Corporate will be receiving a phone call from me 1st thing in the morning. How dare you treat people like this? Loyal customers at that! If it wasn't for customers you wouldn't have jobs to pay your bills. I will never give this location my business. I will drive the extra mile just to have a decent human being greet me at the counter."}
{"text":"Staff is really friendly and always gets the order correct... lots of coupons and specials... but WAY too salty crust, sugary sauce, and dough crust that never seems to cook... no matter how long you put it into the oven once you get it home.

\"What do you mean the game starts in 15 min?\" place to grab dinner quick."}
{"text":"Love hungry howies. My family eats there once every week and enjoys the flavored crust. Staff is always nice and cheerful and ready to help with any problems you have. Witnessed many rude customers while I've waited for my order, and they always seem to handle them with the same cheery helpful attitude. Id recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if possible, they put us on hold  for ten minutes, then wouldn't answer their phones again after we called back. We called 45 mins before the store closed, so if these pathetic burn outs, who don't deserve minimum wage because they clearly don't even do their jobs, aren't going to keep the store open for the times noted on here, then they need to update their hours. I will be contacting the manager of this establishment tomorrow as well as the district manager."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, has bad customer service, and under cooks its Hot Wings. The pizza I had was mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"Everything is good at Hungry Howie's EXCEPT the salads. If you steer clear of them, you'll be fine. Of course if you don't mind big chunks of lettuce cores and/or brown lettuce, knock yourself out. Their salads used to be very good a few years back, but no more. The last couple of times we ordered from there, the wife insisted on getting a salad against my advice. She will likely not make that mistake again. The last one was probably the worst of the worst. All the lettuce was brown and slimy, like they dug it out from the back of the cooler where it was about 2 hours away from going into full rot mode."}
{"text":"This pizza crust is amazing! We used to be big fans of Papa John's until I had this pizza at a work function. So many different choices of crust flavors, they are sure to have something for everyone. Just recently got hooked on the Howie bread, too. Not only is the pizza tasty but the crew at this location are outstanding. Always pleasant and cheerful, even the delivery driver when it's crappy weather. This is one place you should not miss out on!!"}
{"text":"good pizza for a good price. the delivery times could be improved that's why it doesn't get 5 stars"}
{"text":"I personally love the pizza, though you can tell they may not be of the highest quality. They guy honored a coupon for me a couple mins after they closed but they still helped me out. Don't see that from a lot of places anymore. It was a while ago and I'm sure they guy not working there anymore but that was a good call."}
{"text":"This place is so slowwwww!!! Not a place to order from when you're hungry and looking for something last minute. Take so long to deliver pizza and by the time it gets to you you forget that you even order the pizza in the first place! Other than that, taste good and customer service is okay"}
{"text":"We recently moved form California to Arizona and were so excited to have HH nearby... However... This place is a hot mess! I have been there on three separate occasions with terrible experiences. The first time I ordered the kid let someone else walk out with my pizzas and only checked the ones I had after the fact. He went chasing the guy out to his car to ask him if we could switch.... First red flag. The second time I ordered I showed up to pick up my pizzas and the kid had cut his finger with a knife and had his hand wrapped in a bloody towel. He proceeded to bring over my 2 of 4 small pizzas with one hand to the counter. It was disgusting... He then explained that he had dropped two of them and they were re-making them really quickly. By the time those were finished the original two were cold and gross after being kept in the hot box. The last time we went one of the pizzas was burnt to a crisp because they said when they took it out it needed more cook time. They cooked the crap out of it. 

I gave it 2 stars because I love HH but this place needs to get employees that have more common sense! It is constantly full of kids that seem of high school age and lacking in very basic life skills."}
{"text":"Friday night + 4 hungry kids + 2 tired parents + 1 BOGO coupon = Pizza from closest takeout pizza joint which, in our case, is Hungry Howies. We went with the Maui Howie with ham and pineapple along with a pepperoni with extra cheese. Both were a little skimpy on toppings, had an extra sweet red sauce and disappointing crusts, but the kids liked them, and let's face, kids are their target market anyway. 

There were other positives: Our order was ready on time, was accurate and the workers were friendly enough. They also posted an impressive 99 sanitary rating. All and all, however, they are what they are, a decent kid's pizza joint and when rated as such, I can justify 3 stars."}
{"text":"They do not honor the coupon available on Yelp. This sucks b/c the Yelp coupon is better than any deal HH offers."}
{"text":"First off, they have no prices on their mailed menus or online, other than specials. And, when I called the kid who picked up was not friendly AT ALL! I decided to order the $16.99 pick 3 special, which I had a coupon for from Hungry Howies. When the rude kid gave me the total he said it was $24.+ . I asked why it was so much and he told  that the price had changed to $18.99 . I said, \"well I have a non-expired coupon for $16.99.\" He then said, \"well, the price has changed.\" I asked to speak to a manager. Manuel (supervisor) got on the phone. I told him I had a coupon and asked that since it was from Hungry Howies and there is no expiration date on it, will they honor it. He, at first said \"no\",then said \"ok, that's fine, I'll go ahead and give it to you at $16.99. Not a big deal\" 

I chose not to purchase the \"deal\" only because I was unsure of what they might do to my food. I did tell Manuel that the kid who I originally spoke with was rude and very unfriendly. 

I will no longer order pizza or any other \"deal\" from Hungry Howies. It was very upsetting to have to argue with staff and manager about honoring a unexpired coupon from their own company."}
{"text":"Dude answered the phone had attitude. Over charged us, pizza came a lil on the colder side."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  \"Jared\" the manager hung up on me when when I asked him how much longer my food might be.  I would never order from this location. I never got my food."}
{"text":"Had butter cheese crust / cheese pizza and standard pepperoni pizza. 

I was expecting ok pizza. 
Keep in mind I never heard of this chain and I did not want to drive to pick up. 

They delivered before expected time and pizza was so good.  
I will definitely be buying more pizza soon."}
{"text":"I had HH for the first time in PhD and OMG was the pizza phenomenal!!! I was thrilled to find out one would deliver to my house. I topped a huge game to my family on why we should order here and not Nick & Ben or Burros. Well jokes on me. Should went with something I knew was good not matter where I went.  I order the Philly pizza because last time I had it , it was yummy and had this incredible sauce. I called to say there is no sauce on my pizza and the guy was positive it didn't come with a sauce. When asked what type of sauce is the website is referring to he just kept reading my the toppings. Never again will I order nasty Howie."}
{"text":"My family loves to order from hungry howies. You should try the calzones. Also the online orders always have some kind of deal like free breadsticks or dessert."}
{"text":"Pepperoni, bacon and buttercheese crust.... yuuuummmy! lol. Hungry Howies is by far my favorite pizza place of ALL times! food is ready within 15 minutes for pick up... and i live 10 mins away so it works out great each time! Always ready on time! :)"}
{"text":"Sometimes their pizza is the best Howies has ever made, and other times it's a complete bust. If you're willing to roll the dice, you may get an amazing pizza...or you might get something hardly worth eating."}
{"text":"Terrible service we had several issues with our order and I sent 2 emails to their corporate office requesting to be contacted it has been almost a month and still have not heard back. I do understand things happen and orders get messed up but to not be contacted is unacceptable. Tina"}
{"text":"You really should try the sandwiches.  They make them with baked pizza crust... try the philly cheese steak... very very yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place gets zero stars.  I called at 2;45. It's says they're open til 4. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I then called back 5 TIMES and still no answer. So if they cannot at least answer my call during open hours I have no reason to return here and will be putting this review on all social networking not to mention my friends and family. I'll also be calling management tomorrow to let them know how false advertisement and rude customer service is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Their pizza is great! ...when it's not late, cold, and wrong.

Our order took two hours to get to us, with no explanation or apology. We discovered our pizza was thin crust - not what I ordered - and stone cold. I am just glad I ordered through GrubHub, who gave me a $10 coupon to make up for it.

Not worth it! Until I see better reviews, I'll order elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place. They said it would take an hour and a half for delivery, which I was fine with. It's going on two hours and they won't even answer the phone to give me an update or refund me."}
{"text":"Correct order. Fast and friendly delivery drivers so far. Will continue ordering delivery"}
{"text":"Fantastic lady delivery driver.  I think her name is Melissa? It doesn't say on the receipt but thanks multiple times.  Fast and accurate.  Apartment complex too"}
{"text":"Very slow and not fresh. I ordered delivery from this store, 5 minutes from my house and it said it would take about 40 minutes. After 40 minutes the store called me and said it would be another 20 because I live so far north.. Not sure what that means when I'm 3 blocks from it. Then the person on the phone explained that it was because the driver had another delivery first. So now my pizza is late and not even fresh. Not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Ordered food at 725pm.  Received email that the food was it's way at 740pm.  Order arrived at 848 pm and it was ice cold!!!!  Driver wasnt even apologetic  Never order at hungry howies again."}
{"text":"it's inexpensive pie,  nothing that's going to win big awards for world's best pizza,  but the value is fair for the price, it's convenient and most of all the staff and kitchen do a great job,  never had a sloppy or undertopped or incorrectly cooked pie.      I hope those guys are paid well,  i'd pay more for my pie if i knew it was going to the guys who actually make the pie and do the hands on work"}
{"text":"Hungry  Howies is a basic pizza joint with cheap pizza, saucy wings, and delicious baked sandwiches. I recently had a bad experience with this store, so I gave them a bad review. However, they have redeemed themselves.

It all came down to an overcooked pizza and a seemingly rude store manager. Well...my pizza was freshly remade and re-delivered to me within 20 minutes, along with 2 coupons for free pizza on next order.

Steve, the manager came through, and the new pizza was much better. Even though Hungry Howies is just a basic pizza joint, the service was great, which makes the whole experience 10X better. Way to go, Steve!"}
{"text":"Love the flavored crusts, but the food in general tends to be a bit on the extra salty side. Great for a cheap and quick dinner fix, but if I have a little more money on hand I'm very likely to get my pizza from another restaurant."}
{"text":"For the price and size it was okay. I was not too impressed because in comparison to the other pizza business, it is about the same. The advantage they have is the crust."}
{"text":"We ordered from here the first day in our new home, also the first NFL Sunday this season. I was expecting about an hour wait. They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food. 

We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. We're used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if we'll order from here again, unless we don't find our NY style place, but it was still good."}
{"text":"I pre-ordered online to have it delivered at my job. The salad was much bigger than expected. I don't think I will be ordering again only because there was a rotten pepper on it and it was placed just right so I wouldn't notice it of course. There were way to many hot peppers and I can't eat them anyway.  That's the only reason why I'm giving 2 stars was because of the pepper. I even took a pic of it."}
{"text":"If there was a choice to give a zero star I would. This location is 100% terrible its a joke. They don't do anything they say. You order online and 40 min to deliver is a laugh as they still don't show up nor call nor email you its going to be late. They hire teens whom do not have a clue and managers are the worst at handling problems. I'll call corporate because this is out of line DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE."}
{"text":"Love HH! Anytime I'm craving Pizza this is my goto spot. It doesn't hurt that it's walking distance from my house And I can't help but stick with the butter cheese crust! I'd have to say this is what keeps me coming back for more. Easily the best $5 pizza spot around North Las Vegas. Hit this spot when you get the munchies. It's bound to satisfy."}
{"text":"Still waiting for my pizza. Ordered food. Never came. Called driver. No Call. Called Hungry Howies. Was told to leave the drive a message. Dear hungry howies and all of your employees. Please get an education you useless pieces of scum you try to pass as a human being. Its your job to create easy and efficient customer service. No one expects you to be a 5 star steakhouse but please, like use proper english when like, people call you, and maybe dont suck. Cause you freaking suck. I bet the pizza prolly tastes good but who knows. If i wait a few more hours i might find out! (I wont)"}
{"text":"Bottom line: We have had better luck at this location (Guadalupe and Dobson) ordering for PICK-UP. and ordering by PHONE call.

We had always had good pizza and service from here doing carry-out. Got an email with a coupon, thought we'd try the online ordering. It works well for other places, why not this one, we thought? I'll pay the extra $ for delivery, I'm feeling lazy today. OK.

It was a Friday night, around 1015pm. I went online to order. Order went through, seemingly no problems. Said delivery time was an hour and 10 minutes.
BUT - within 30 minutes, the little tracker told me my pizza was on its way! Woohoo! I am feeling really great about this location at this point.

10, then 20, then 30 minutes pass without the pizza arriving. I wonder if his GPS got him lost? I call the store to find out what's going on with our pizza. 

\"Oh, it's on its way now.\" What? I got a notification half hour ago that it's on its way. Why is it taking this long to get here, it's only 10 min away from your store?

Then came the avalanche of half-whining, half-excuses, no apologies. Apparently this guy will get fired if the little tracker goes above 25 minutes, so he marks them all as on their way at a certain point so they can meet their metrics and he won't get fired. Even if they're not even being prepped for oven yet. THIS IS WHAT HE SAID TO ME!! I couldn't believe it. 

To confirm, I said, did you just tell me that you lied about my pizza being on its way so you could trick your boss and so you wouldn't get fired? He dodged the question. Repeatedly. He kept answering questions I hadn't asked, trying NOT to answer that one. I can't tell you how much I hate it when people answer a question I didn't ask instead of the one I did ask. I kept asking it over and over since I never got an answer. 

Now, to be fair - the delivery driver was SO sorry and apologetic and very nice. He had no idea I had been on the phone with the store. He told me he was the only driver and the other one just walked out and went home when they got slammed. (I'm like, it's Friday nite - your store doesn't have more than 2 people scheduled for delivery on a Friday nite?) He's the only reason they didn't get 2 stars instead of 3.

If you want pizza delivery, pick someone else, or don't believe their tracker. If you're not feeling lazy, just go pick it up. Pizza etc isn't bad. Just the customer service."}
{"text":"This place has grown as a franchise and they have absolutely no interest in providing customer service or even following up when they might lose a customer. I ordered a simple pepperoni pizza. After an  hour and a half they finally delivered me a ham and pineapple pizza. See my email chain with regard to my complaint.

The franchise manager never contacted me. And the \"Franchise Representative\" well...make your own determination based on the exchange. I got a one word sentence. I am happy that at least they responded but the response is just in my opinion representative of the culture and lack of service due to the large customer base.

{"text":"The owner is a class act. I wrote a review on the southwest rapid rewards program and the owner responded and gave me free coupons. I've never heard of that happening before and I was extremely impressed. 
I have come in and they completely forgot to make my pizza (never got made), but I'm easy going and it wasn't a big deal. Mistakes happen. 

I love hungry howies. I'll always be a customer. :) 

Excellent owner."}
{"text":"This place is a joke..  First time we ordered a pizza we recieved a totally different pizza from what we ordered..  even the size was wrong.    They issued us a credit for the difference in size but did not remake our order..    next time we order to use our credit the pizza arrives wrong again..  size is right but the pizza has totally different topping and crust...  not sure what is so hard about pepperoni and mushroom....  one that was delivered had green pepper and onion.. not even close...   call again and complain and they issue us a credit for a free pizza...   3 weeks later and we decide to use our credit and of course...   they say they dont have a credit for us..   they cant make a damn pizza with 2 common toppings correct..  i guess i was expecting too much for them to actually stand by the credit they issued.  Never again...  and I will gladly share my experience...  avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Shouldn't even get 1 star! I've never had such awful customer service and to top that it was by a Manager!!????  His name is John? Jonathan?? Hung up on my without saying goodbye after my order took 20 min past my quoted delivery. Pizza is cold, wings cold, salad warm. I asked for a corporate number or a higher up and he said \"find it online\" ! I've been in the service industry for 16 years and understand things happen, but to not even give an apology or help with the issue is unacceptable! You John are of no significance to a company with the attitude you have. This location will not succeed with management like him. I will find the correct person to contact involving this matter with or without your help."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 3:29 with the expectations of the pizza being delivered in 30-40 minutes. An hour goes by so I decide to reach out to see if there is an issue with my pizza - They tell me the pizza is out for delivery and you should be receiving it any minute. Another 40 minutes goes by and finally the pizza is delivered. At this point, I am pretty sure they started making it after I called and asked where my pizza was. I open the box up (1) no ranch like I had requested and (2) it is cold. 

Probably the last time I order from Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"If you are just looking for a good Friday night pizza this will make you happy. The garlic Parmesan crust is delicious. Is it gourmet pizza? No but it is fantastic when you are looking for something that goes great with beer. I would say the bigger reason I am giving it five stars is the customer service. All the employees here are super friendly and they are always willing to crack a joke to get a smile out of you. Really blows me away how sweet and friendly they are like a real neighborhood place, hope that doesn't change!"}
{"text":"I believe Hungry Howies was started in Michigan, which is close to my heart, so already this little pop-in-and-pick-up pizza joint rates high on my list.

Free flavored crust, all the regular pizza toppings, wings, cheese bread, calzones, salads...HH has it all.  

Not a dine-in restuarant, you'll want to have this pie delivered or have your bf pick it up.  

I've never had a bad meal from here, or waited longer than normal to have it delivered.  Always friendly highschool/college kids working the counter, clean, accurate with orders.  Who can ask for more from a pizza place?"}
{"text":"terrible - late and cold. driver said she didn't know how to find me. who's fault is that???"}
{"text":"Not the best, but cheap and good delivery. I would recommend Hungry Howie's to anybody who wants a fast pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent location, great food, & excellent service. Had a late night craving, never been here, & I was a bit hesitant because relatively cheap food usually = bad service, bad food. But not the case! The gentleman named Santiago at the register took my order, was so so personable & respectful, explained to me my options, gave me great recommendations, & is SO NICE!! This location has a great staff! I will definitely be back soon! 

I got the Pizza Delux Calzone (delicious) with mozz cheese, pepperoni, Italian sausage, bacon, & jalapeño. Great serving size for $6.99 & baked fresh to order. Tons (seriously) of options, not just pizzas with great prices! I was pleasantly surprised definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am always pleased with this location. The pizza always seems to be fresh and made correctly. I ordered a personal pepperoni and sausage pizza that was great !"}
{"text":"Love their flavored crust pizza...not my all time favorite Pizza, but their close and timely on delivery....can DO!!!!"}
{"text":"My last visit

Placed a \"to go\" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with Asiago flavored crust. I walked in to Hungry Howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  However, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge I was there and  to get my order. 

The pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas I have ever had from Hungry Howies and the order wasn't even correct. I wish I would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  I called Hungry Howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct.  The associate who answered the phone response was \"Sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  I guess we can cook another\".  After waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza I head back up to Hungry Howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). Since I wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes I took the pizza and headed home.

My previous experiences with Hungry Howies has always been hit or miss. I think I will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area."}
{"text":"I was at a birthday party for a friend and he had pizzas from delivered from Hungry Howie's. I'm not sure I had ever even heard of the chain before but the pizza was quite good. It was still warm when it showed up, was delivered in under an hour on a Saturday night, and was pretty good. My friend didn't order any of the flavored crust pizzas (which everyone else was raving about being so good, so I'll need to go back and try that at some point) but the standard cheese, pepperoni, and meat lovers were all quite good."}
{"text":"I have added a half star for friendly and prompt service.  We have eaten carry out from here a half dozen times, usually because of the convenient location and good price.  My pizza has 4 toppings and I have named it \"the TOMB\"!  Tomato, onion, mushrooms and bacon.   It is the combo I order  when trying a new pizza place.  Taste was nice, good flavors but the quantity of each individual topping was sparse.  I would have enjoyed more cheese as well.  An average pizza with good potential if it were \"enriched\" some!  This could be a \"home run\" with a little help and a bit more expense for the management.  I guess I'm asking for more, for less.  I just might return again to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Five bucks for a large pizza?  Pretty good deal, even if its size is a bit more more \"medium\" than \"large.\"  I love the original crust (though they have a lot of yummy-sounding flavored crusts).  Another thing I like is that it seems like it's the only pizza in town (Scottsdale) that isn't \"thin\" crust.   Delicious!   Five stars!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delivered fast and hot. The garlic & seasoning crust was very good especially the next morning. I ordered the meat pizza, the amount of toppings were very good not to much."}
{"text":"Just waiting up to 45 minutes. It was easy to order online. And you can get up to 7% cash back of your a part of the Yelp cash back program. Hope that means online delivery orders, and just call or walk ins."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza today as we had a coupon.  Had 3 different kinds-never again.  Not good pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza for delivery, which apparently never registered. Waited 45 minutes and still didn't hear back at all. Called in and asked for the status for it and received terrible and very rude service. He was very demeaning and that has definitely caused me to never order from them again. I hope management reads this because it's the pizza is good but your staff is highly disrespectful"}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a friend, I decided to give Hungry Howie's a try, in lieu of Little Caesars for their $5 one topping pizza.

I liked the yellow and black NYC taxicab-ish theme.

I was greeted by an unfriendly, inattentive employee who took payment and left on a delivery.

The lobby was very dirty and the general maintenance was poor. Dirt and garbage everywhere, dirty, poorly maintained soda machines, and a non-operational TV adorn the interior of this joint.

The pizza was mediocre at best, on par or below the standards of similarly priced and staffed outfits. (Little Caesars, for example)

It will take some serious convincing to pass up Little Caesars for this place in my future cheap pizza excursions."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate giving terrible reviews but I have never had such a horrible experience. On Saturday 9/3/2016 I ordered 2 pizzas online at 12:49. I didn't hear anything from them and called at 1:45. They said that the online delivery times were off and it was taking about an hour and a half for deliveries and I should have it soon. I called again at 2:00pm and was informed there was a \"borrowed\" driver doing deliveries and they couldn't get ahold of them but it should have been delivered. They said they would call me back. I called back again at 2:30 and they said I would get 25% off my order (this is what the order taker said, I hadn't spoken to a manager). At 3:00 with no pizza I called back again, they said they had to remake my pizzas and they would be there within 5 minutes and would comp my order and my next order would be free. I finally got my pizza at about 3:15. As of today my card has not been reimbursed and when I called in to ask about a free order, I described the situation and asked how to go about getting the order comped and \"Garret\" said there was no record of a comp and said there was no way. When I asked for a manager he said he was the manager. When I asked to speak to a district manager he said she would be in tomorrow and to call back. He said there was no record of my order from my phone number, but when I mentioned the order was taken online and that I could pull up the  confirmation numbers he just kept saying it would have to be tied to the phone number. I'll never be using this location again. At this point I just want to make sure my card gets reimbursed."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and salad for delivery. They were very polite on the phone. The order came in a timely manner, friendly delivery driver. The pizza was very good. My only disappointment was my salad seemed to have a lot of soggy lettuce. I definitely will order from hereva

Third week in a row I came here. I come to Mesa every Tuesday, the pizza this week was just as good as ever and the customer service was excellent. The Specials are really a good price and the pizza is always hot.

Came again for a pizza, always great and customer service great, the young lady that helped me on 5/30 at 2:30 was awesome. Thanks for the great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Never again will I order pizza from Hungry Howies! They stole $70 from us and we didnt get any pizza!! The guy taking our order had no idea what he was doing. He talked so fast I couldn't understand him. He swiped both mine and my husbands cards and said they were both declined. Well our bank told us the money was there but HH was ran FIVE times. The manager said they didn't get paid so we didn't get dinner last night AND we are out $70 until the district manager resolves it with our bank. An hour of figuring things out on the phone last night and no pizza or refund. Its too band they are incompetent employees because I did loved the way their pizza tasted. Do not order Hungry Howies!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I get the pizza delivered to my house all the time. Awesome food, always warm, great customer service!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but I've had better. There isn't a lot of parking in the direct area so you may have to park a bit off. Plus this place takes forever to make you food. We called for pick up. They said 30 minutes.  We waited 30 minutes and drove over as we are in the neighborhood behind them. Still had to wait another 15 minutes for our foid. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Zero stars......  A couple of weeks ago we ordered a pizza and was told that we would get it in 45 minutes.  After an hour and a half still no pizza. We made a call and they said it was on the way.  It arrived minutes later and we were offered a free orange soda, gee thanks.....  The pizza was wrong and cold. I mentioned it to the driver, good job on his part to mention that to the MOD.  She called back and said that we would get a free pizza on our next order.  Two weeks later, we decide to take them up on their offer to correct their mistake.  BIG MISTAKE. We were again told that the pizza would show up in 45 minutes, wrong.  One hour and thirty minutes, two phone calls from the driver and one from us later, the pizza arrives.  It was cold.  Let me ask you this, when you are trying to make up for a previous mistake wouldn't you make every effort to make sure that you can win that customer back?  Well, that did not happen. The pizza arrived 45 minutes late and was cold, I don't appreciate having to nuke my, what was supposed to be hot in the first place, pizza.  We will NEVER order from this place again.  Horrible customer service.  Horrible people skills.  Just a disappointed customer. Never again will I let them take my money."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza last Sunday, shortly after I received a confirmation email.. after reading the email I notice it wasn't what I ordered,  I proceeded to call the location to verify my order..the employee verified that I was in fact getting the right pizza, and also that my pizza was already out for delivery (1:20pm) My pizza arrived at 1:58pm...and ice cold, I called the location yet again to see why it took so long and to tell her it was ice cold...her response was \"He has 4 deliveries..I will credit you for next time\" Well...there won't be a next time for us."}
{"text":"Here is an update the review from yesterday.  Today we called and spoke with a manager in order to ask when the refund from the voided order would clear.  She offered to deliver our same order for free today. Changing from 1 to 3 stars.  We had the three cheese and the cinnamon breadsticks and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"The delivery guys are always super friendly, and the pizza is decent for a late night delivery place. No complaints about either. 

However the guys in the store answering phones are terrible. They interrupt, mumble, are short with you and are not friendly at all. I've dealt with it because they're the only people that deliver late, but after last night I'm never ordering there again.

We got home after a show at midnight and wanted food before bed so we ordered from the only place open: hungry howies. Ordering took several minutes because the guy kept interrupting me and mumbling and I had to ask him to repeat himself every single sentence, which was aggravating. He told me the pizza would be there in 45 minutes to an hour, which was fine. We sat up waiting, my boyfriend fell asleep and after an hour and a half I was so hungry I just made something else and was getting ready to get into bed when FINALLY, the guy shows up. The delivery guy was great, but overall this pizza place is insanely slow and the in store employees need some help with customer service."}
{"text":"This place gets it's two stars for the pizza, it actually was pretty decent, good sauce and the flavored garlic crust was good. We got the pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and onion and I liked it. The pricing was comparable to the 10+ other pizza places in the area. The cheese breadstick were just ok. 
   The minus 3 stars was for the service/employees working there when we went in. They were arguing with one another, the delivery driver walked in and he was definitely stoned. Don't come to work stoned then again I'm  sure he gets free pizza and munchies for his higher state. Though the pizza was worth it we decided we can get pizza from other places with better service and better cheesebread. I was not impressed with the unprofessionalism of the employees when we went in."}
{"text":"Really decent pizza for the price and the flavored garlic and herb crust was just as tasty as it was a year ago. We walked in to order and as they handed us our pizza they dropped it. For our inconvenience while they remade our pizza they gave us the two they dropped plus a 2 liter free. Great customer service and the manager apologized to us again as we left. For a pizza joint: great service and tasty food."}
{"text":"So inconsistent. Ordered last night and it must have been Opposite Day because I ordered light sauce, 2x butter crust, double cut. I received what seemed like triple sauce, dry crust, and almost uncut. Had to cut pizza ourselves at home. There was sooo much sauce that the pizza was soggy and disgusting. The three cheese bread was missing a lot of cheese. Total waste of money. I've complained at least twice in the past year but the pizza has only gotten worse & the manager isn't pleasant or apologetic, so I don't think I will waste my time with another call. We have been ordering at least once a week on average for the past few years but this time the pizza was so bad that I just didn't eat dinner. Time to find a new Friday night go-to. I just can't waste another dollar on food that gets thrown away. The drivers are always friendly, though."}
{"text":"Well...I've previously used their pick up and/or delivery without fault-great price, reasonable product, quick service..and the flavored crusts are awesome. However, I'm typing this review at 4:30 am and pizza-less after ordering for my boyfriends stomach at 2:45 after a long night's Halloween crawl. No one will answer the phone in store and my boyfriend literally just fell asleep sitting up 6x+ dreaming of Mariana cheese breads/food but only to awake to a pizza-less and sad existence. What the hell Hungry Howie's?! I'm easy to please but this is just awful. I guess I'll wait up until your closing hours and hope you answer in the AM so I can get my money back. I even pre paid a generous tip...seriously?!?! Boo..."}
{"text":"The Cajun crust with pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, and jalapeños is always delicious. Never really craved pizza until I tried this one! Always fast and hot!"}
{"text":"Four stars relative to its competition (fast food pizza and delivery places).

$5.55 for a large one-topping carryout is a good deal, and the pizza is better than we expected.  The cheese is advertised as real mozzarella and is probably the highlight; next time I'll ask for extra. The flavored crust is unique in this segment.  We tried the garlic herb and it is good.  Their online menu did not list jalapenos as a topping, but they have them.  The hot wings are the same as you get at any pizza place, baked in the oven and not crispy.  The hot sauce is serviceable but not memorable.  We tried an order of the cinnamon bread and we surprised at how good it was.  Not a gourmet dish of course, but chewy with lots of cinnamon and icing; it really cures a sweet tooth.

Based on reviews prior to 04/2012 we anticipated poor service, but the nice lady who took our phone order was very patient and friendly.  My wife picked up the order and she said the place looked clean and everybody was friendly, even when she tacked on the order of cinnamon bread as an impulse buy (she smelled it when she walked into the store and had to buy it).  She also said the baked subs smelled awesome, so we may try those next time we want something cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Hold up.. You in the mood to have your mind BLOWN?! If so, then put that trash pizza you're munching on and bring yoself to Hungry Howies! It's the dopest take out pizza around! No need to hipster it up with a bunch of crazy \"artisan\" bullcrap.. HH's just dishes out that good ole \"it's 9:55pm and I'm not cooking dinner pizza\". They have Cajun crust.. So get your mind right and order you a super tasty cheap pie!"}
{"text":"So the pizza was ehhh ok pretty much what I expected but when I first walked in there was a woman sitting in the lobby looking to be doing some paper work perhaps a manager or owner of the store although she was wearing a long dress. As I walked in a man from the kitchen walks out with no gloves on and a hand full of sliced chicken proceeds to hand her some and they both begin eating it and he walks back into the kitchen no big deal... Grosssss!!!!"}
{"text":"I give them one star because it's required haha and the delivery driver was fast. Other than that, I can't be too mad about the waste of money doing my gut feeling said not to order from here lol. The pizza was salty as hell and although I asked for well done, burnt was a little too extreme. I'm thinking they just reheated a pizza sitting in the counter because the driver can in 10 minutes I swear lmao."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay only but you get what you pay for and it's cheap. The main problem is the last three times i have tried to order I have been told there are no delivery drivers so my only choice is to pick it up. Fail."}
{"text":"what is with the horrible customer service at this place. I just tried to call and order a pizza and the dude on the phone sounded like the heroin just kicked in or something. I literally asked the dude if he was stoned or something and he just said \"ughhh\" and hung the phone up."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Hungry Howie's Pizza on more times than I can count, since I was in high school if you can believe that! I love the garlic bread pizza crust and so do all of my friends.

Not only do they have great pizza but it is silly cheap. I mean, $5 for a large pizza and good quality? Sounds like Little Ceasers but this pizza is actually pretty bomb! Not only that but their delivery service is always fast, even at high times like 2am or so.

If you haven't tried hungry howies pizza yet, now is the time!"}
{"text":"This location is unprofessional, I waited over 2 hours for my delivery and when I was promised a free pizza, my name and information was suddenly not in their \"system\". The manager was unaccommodating, I was in the hospital and tried to order a pizza for my husband to pick up and she said I had to come in to pick it up after I told her that I was in the HOSPITAL."}
{"text":"I've ordered 6 large pizzas from Hungry Howie's pizza so far in a span of 3 weeks. Is it possible that they did something to the cheese or the sauce? I have no idea, but I have no more complaints against Hungry Howie's anymore.

I prefer their pizzas over Domino's too. That says a lot (or a little)."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza and salad online. I thought it would be more convenient than going there to pick it up. This location isn't that far from my place, so with the 45 min approx wait time, I thought I could expect my food close to that. Not sure of their process but I have a feeling it doesn't take the actual pizza 45 mins to cook (correct me if I'm wrong.) So I gave them a call 45 mins after their 45 mins was up, and was told it was on the road and would be there any minute. I'm pretty sure the guy on the phone was the one that delivered it to me, so that was cool. In all it took about 1 hour and 45 mins to get my pizza, which arrived not even remotely hot. If I hadn't been starving at the point, I probably wouldn't have eaten any of it. I haven't touched the salad, but I guess at this point the salad is moot."}
{"text":"What an awful experience!! Just like another reviewer Hannah said,
I ordered online, only i DID use my debit card to pay for it AND since i don't 
have any cash on hand, i even included a TIP for the delivery person but 
the pizza never came! Even tho I received a text msg from my bank 
showing the charge went thru with Hungry Howies name in it! I also got
an email confirmation telling me my order was placed! When i called, the guy said 
they never got my order! I told him that my card had been charged so i already paid for it, now what do i do? I have hungry kids waiting to eat! He didn't offer to make the order or anything! He suggested i call the other store which is in another city to see if THEY got it! I dont have time for that! But he wasn't willing to call for me so i call, they dont have it either! So WHAT are u gonna do i asked? Cuz i already paid for it! He offers to do nothing! He said to call the EAT 24 number which i did & nobody answered! He said he called the manager and asked what he should do & not even the manager told him to make the order! He said the manager said, \"I don't know. I guess have her call EAT 24! (Which is the company the online order menu is thru. The manager offered no solution! So here they have taken my money AND a tip they didnt even work for! And i get no dinner for my kids! This has obviously happened before becuz of Hannah's review showing it has, only SHE was smart & chose the cash option so she wasn't out any money, but there was no cash option when i ordered, i HAD to use my debit card! I only had a little bit of money in my bank so its not like i can order again or take my money and get food somewhere else! THEY took my money! I am SO upset right now its not even funny! What am i supposed to feed my kids now? I don't get paid til tomorrow so the way things look at this point, we're gonna go without dinner! I have proof the payment went thru so WHY wudn't they offer to make the pizza anyway and deliver it? They had the same insincere attitude they had with Hannah! I am disgusted with this place and plan on telling everyone i know, This is so wrong!

EDIT: i called back & pretty much had to ask them to PLEASE make the order and deliver it becuz I have kids that I'm not gonna let go hungry just becuz they have a
screwed up system that they can't seem to fix. I told them I would be more than happy to show the delivery person the text and email showing the order was placed
and that I was charged and they agreed to do that. I don't understand why that wasn't offered in the first place instead of doing nothing. 2 hrs later, the pizza came. It wasn't bad but it wasn't delicious and when your hungry, food is food. I asked if they would throw in a 2ltr bottle of pepsi and they did do that, but none of this would've been done if I didn't call back and ask/beg. This was my first time ever ordering from this place and my first encounter was extremely stressful and anger provoking & i'm surprised I was as cordial as I was becuz it was extremely frustrating. The only way I would even consider giving this place my business again is if I receive a SINCERE apology, an explanation and a solution that conveys they have this problem worked out cuz from the other reviewers reviews, this has happened more than one or two times. They should've made sure this problem was fixed the very first time it happened and I am appauled that it was not. Nobody should have to be put thru this dilemma when patronizing a business they are giving their money too and I hope some kind of compensation is given to those who HAVE been put thru this becuz it is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I was apprehensive but everything was perfect! We just moved here and had never heard of Hungry Howie's but decided to give it a try. I ordered online with an estimated delivery of 40 mins, pizza was at my door in only 25 minutes! Hot, fresh, delicious, and speedy - what more could you ask for in a pizza? The flavored crusts were yummy. I like how the website has tons of coupons right on it - no need to hunt Groupon or retailmenot. We will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"New to the area, found Hungry Howies and have them a try. Easy app ordering with coupons! We got the BBQ chicken with Asiago crust, amaze balls!! Fast and courteous delivery service. A+!"}
{"text":"I had not eaten in about 12 hours since we were at the hospital having a baby... and this pizza STILL tasted horrible.

Barely average fast food quality and taste. Avoid!"}
{"text":"While they were open (closed in April 2016) they were never a good option. They constantly didn't have main menu items and toppings. The delivery was well within normal times for a place 3 blocks from my house.  The wings were average, but were hot and properly cooked. The new place in this location is \"Senior Pizza\" and it is GREAT! They don't deliver yet, but they are worth a pickup. Their Hawaiian pizza is excellent. The pepperoni is excellent too. Just the right amount of zest and spice to make it flavorful, without burning the mouth. Give Senior Pizza a chance. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have always loved this chain from when  I lived in Arizona.  I decided to hit them up again in Nevada since my move and was not disappointed

I ordered a large pizza and wings for delivery. The pizza was delivered in shorter then the amount of time that was quoted to me. The pizza arrived hot and fresh and so did the wings. Both were delicious. The flavored crust is definitely my favorite part of this pizza. I got the garlic and herb one. 

The person that answered the phone was very polite, friendly and helpful.  He explained all the specials and provided exceptional customer service. 

I definitely recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"I live about 30 second drive from them and took almost and hour to get the food here
Called them and they said well we had other orders 
I said well I could have walked there and been back by now 
No discount no hookup 
Not happy gonna stick to dominoes
Alteast they show up on time
Pizza was cold
And boneless fingers are cold and nasty 
Don't try to win me back 
I'm  done with u guys good luck keeping doors open
Ewwwe"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Food came 24 min after we ordered. Idk who made my pizza and bread, but that shit was fire!! It may have been the best Howie's pizza I've had. I mean it was perfect.. wings on the other hand. Meh. But everything else was on point! Thank you"}
{"text":"This hungry Howie's has exceptional service and even better pizza. I am a frequent customer of this Hungry Howie's Pizza past midnight and the team not only knows my order but knows my name and always serve me with a smile or great attitude over the phone. Great prices. Even better service. All for it!"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from me and is decently priced.  Last time I ordered there I found a whole entire food service glove inside of my salad.  Extremely Gross,  I did call and they replaced the order at a later date which was to be expected or I wanted my money back.  The manager was nice and apologized but I have serious concerns about their food safety practices or lack there of.  This was definitely the biggest item found in my food to date, certainly surpasses a hair or a bug."}
{"text":"I'm not on this side of town very often but I was craving a pizza and very happy to see something other domino's or pizza hut or papa john's. I really am a big fan of Hungry Howies.

Just can't put my finger on what it was about this location. The pizza was okay (pepperoni with garlic crust). And they really seem to know their regulars. All in all, the pie did what I needed it to do. I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"When it comes to chain delivery pizza, Hungry Howie's and Papa Johns take all. Hungry Howie's is good fast pizza. But realistically I think that it takes the cake because of the crust selections! 

-Original
-Ranch
-Cajun
-Onion
-Garlic Herb
-Butter
-Butter Cheese
-Sesame.

The fact that you get to choose your crust is a genius concept and I would take Howies over Pizza Hut, Dominos, and most other big pizza chains."}
{"text":"HH  advertized  a  \"FREE   PIZZA\"   (with  a  Minimum $ 10  Purchase)...   so  actually  it  wasn't   a  Free  Pizza,  it  was  something  like  \"buy  one  get  one  for  free

So  I  went  online,  set  up  an  account  as  per  the  requirements  and  checked  the  box  for  the  $ 9.99    pizza.    Which  was  actually  $  11,-   with  tax.   I  entered  the  promo  code  and  didn't  qualify  for  the  FREE   PIZZA.  The  ad  didn't  say  that   the  tax  wouldn't  count.   But  ok,   the  next   one  was  actually  $ 3,-  more.   I  checked  the  box  for  the  $ 12.99   Pizza  and  entered  the  promo  code.  This  time  it  worked  and  now  I   was  able  to   add  a  \"FREE   MEDIUM  ONE-TOPPING  PIZZA\".    When  trying  to  check  out  I  saw  that   this  \"FREE\"   Pizza  wasn't   free  at  all:   HH   charged  $ 1,50   for the  topping  (mushrooms).    I  called  them  up  and  the  response  was  \"someone  will  call you   back\"  ....     it  never  happened.   

I  don't  care  how  good  or  how  bad  their  pizza  is.   it  is  one  of  my  principles  not  to  do  any  business  with   companies  that  try  to   bs  customers.   At  the  end  they  did  not  get  my  business  with  this  coupon  and  they  won't  get  any  business in the  future  from me  either."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We order a pizza, it gets to an hour and we are calling them & there aren't answering. The pizza still isn't there & when when they finally answer they tell us our pizza was given away at the pool?!? But we told them we were at our apartment and gave them our number. We ended up having to go pick it up. Horrible service, will never order again."}
{"text":"I personally think that Hungry Howies is the best pizza for take out, but I would NOT recommend getting it from this location, on Thomas Road! Here is why:

-Yesterday I just ordered for the first time from this location.  All of our items were slightly burnt (i'm typically not a picky eater and don't notice these things, but I definitely noticed this).

- The crust was hardly flavored- come on people! this is your signature thing!

-Not to mention the place/location is ghetto

-We always get the $10 deal for a large any topping pizza, but when we got our order yesterday, they said that deal was over.

-This is the icing on the cake here.... didn't notice until after we got home that they didn't give us a receipt. I called a different location today to ask if they still have the $10 deal, and they said YES!  So basically, I'm thinking they are a bunch of crooks.  Aren't they all suppose to have the same deals?  My husband even specifically asked them when he picked up our order, to make sure that the deal was still on, and they told him no.  

Never going to this location again! 
If you love their pizza and you want to deal with honest people and good quality pizza, go to the Chandler (Ray road or is it Chandler blvd? I'm not sure, it's the one next to a hair salon) location."}
{"text":"Tasty & Cheap! I used to love their $1 cheese pizza Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"The Howie bread was excellent, the pizza was ok....  too much sauce, causing it to be soggy, but still pretty good"}
{"text":"I have never ordered as delivery. I always pick it up AND it's incredible. In my opinion the thin crust tastes similar to Oreganos but is half the price.

The different crusts are amazing too. Love it. Not sure why it's to $$...I find it to be pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I only have time for positive reviews. Negative experiences are forgotten. I'm a transplant from mi. The geographical origin of hungry Howie's. I have Howie's on lockdown. This specific location is worth mentioning. The staff seems to be very solid currently, because the food is always the way I order it. Don't change anything. 

(This is an opinion piece only. Not responsible for other customers experiences)"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, food was good, pizza crust really good (and I'm from NY)."}
{"text":"We just love all of the pizza flavored crust or just plain rust !
The wings are always fresh and delicious as well.
Fast delivery every time with fresh hot food !!

We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke !!!!   This was my second time ordering from Hungry Howies. The first  time was very similar to my current experience.   I ordered  online using EAT24, the ordering process was easy and straightforward. The horror story  begins when Hungry Howies received the order.  Shortly after the online order ,I get a call from the store stating that my order could not be completed because they didn't have the larger size I wanted . Next was the delivery time , it took almost  1.5 hours to receive my order . I'm no brain surgeon, but it take less than 10 minutes to cook a pizza . Last is the pizza , it was cold tasteless and the dough was bland. This is by far my worst pizza experience ever , avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"I love their flavored crust! The cajun and garlic ones are my favorite. Pizza is good. They normally deliver it super fast to my house. And they have some pretty good deals most of the time."}
{"text":"Don't order pizza from here if you ever expect to eat. You'll wait over an hour and a half for you delivery, still won't get, will have to drive to pick up your pizza because they already charged your card, and it still won't be ready. I couldn't tell you how it tastes because I'm still waiting to eat."}
{"text":"It's my first time eating here never had this pizza before and I'm actually quite impressed it's better than Little Caesars and the employee was super nice and friendly actually enjoyed my experience definitely be purchasing again"}
{"text":"I recently went to the Hungry Howie's #01825 and ordered my food online. Due to an error with the website after i applied a coupon, i paid for a pizza that only had half the toppings on it. My husband called to report the issue and to advise them of the problem with the website. He was put on hold (not even on hold, they just put the phone down) for 10 minutes, all just to be told their is nothing they can do about it. They offered no compensation, no apologizes, no nothing. This experience and lack of customer service has completely turned my family off from using this business again. Not only was it a disappointment to our night, but also a disappointment to the person whose birthday we were celebrating. 

Consider this a loss of 5 loyal customers."}
{"text":"Really awesome staff, super prompt. But how can you go wrong with pizza? (I mean except for pizza hut, which is horribly wrong). Try their flavor crusts for sure, even get a marinara because you'll definitely want to dip it."}
{"text":"For take out pizza, this is your best bet! You'll pay more than Dominoes, Little Ceasers, and Pizza Hut, but for better quality. They have many different options for their crust flavors and options, and I've never had a bad experience! Love this takeout pizza, and they'll always get my service!"}
{"text":"yummy pizza at affordable prices. delivery is expensive tho. I often get their $5 large pizza special"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the bang of your buck. $5.50 for a large one topping and free flavored crust. The wings are pretty good too!!!"}
{"text":"Not fancy pizza but way better than Pizza Hut and dominos pizza, the flavored crust makes the difference;
Butter,asiago cheese,Cajun,butter cheese,sesame,ranch,garlic herbs and onion.
The prices are fair and yes I will come back !!!"}
{"text":"Made a order online through yelp it was fast easy and our food was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been looking for one forever. The place was very clean and both of the workers where friendly with helping me place my order. I wish this store was by my house I would come here every week ."}
{"text":"Ordered a calzone and wings. Wings were mostly bread and sauce was so sweet I almost didn't eat them. Calzone was good but not great."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The staff is always friendly. The only problem I had was the guy making some food in the back didn't wear gloves while touching the food. What REALLY bothered me was he was wearing a watch. Working in the food industry this is a huge no no. And I believe he had a ring (and yes a wedding ring is allowed IF you wear gloves). Update on your health policy procedures and it will be a 5 star!"}
{"text":"For the price, Hungry Howie's is all right. I like the choice of crust flavors, and the coupon deals are reasonable. The Howie's bread is super salty, but otherwise it's the way I like it--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I ordered a pineapple pizza, and there wasn't much cheese. Otherwise, it tasted good. 

I would say this is a step above Little Cesar's."}
{"text":"Since the pizza is not $5 anymore I guarantee this place loses business. The hungry howies $5 pizza has always been an ASU tradition but is slowly dying due to the price change. 
Haha, at least the liquor store, right next to howies, has amazing and CHEAP food. Fresh burritos, tacos, burgers, cheesesteaks, & so much more. All cheaper and better than the best howies pizza
I have already seen countless people frustrated, most canceled their order. The staff, including the manager, started to make fun of the angry customers. The sauce isn't even fresh. Big jimmys is and is only 5bucks. Don't try to charge more than dominoes when your pizza is of the cheapest quality.
Any-who, Goodluck"}
{"text":"Although the price has gone up by a dollar fifty since I first started ordering pizzas from this location, I am too much of a fun of their variety of crusts to not order from here still. At times you may encounter some inattentive, zoned out employees behind the counter or even over the phone, but at other times, you will find an amiable employee helping you out with your order. So far, my favorite crust is the Ranch one, but if I don't order Ranch I will go with the Cajun flavor. This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I bought steak howies roll 03/27/17. I was very  disappointed the meat portion was a very small it was mostl dough. They are  skimming on meat at this location. You will know the  difference when you have had the same thing at another howies location which I have & the meat portion was three times as much at the  surprise location! I will not be returning to this location anymore!"}
{"text":"Always happy with the gluten free pizza. Delivery is always in a descent time. Love all the choices of flavored crusts."}
{"text":"This location doesn't honor internet coupons. They are very \"No can do\" oriented..They don't budget on anything. They always make a mistake. They have no idea what customer service even is. Bad management!"}
{"text":"I like Hungry Howies but I have to say my last order from them was less than poor.....half my order was missing and when I called to let them know the guy on the phone questioned me like I was lying to him and then when I did finally receive the 2 calzones that I was missing the lettuce one them was beyond brown, more like rotten......I ordered a salad and didn't receive any dressing for it.....I won't give up my Hungry Howies I will not let the delivery guy leave until I check the quality of my food next time"}
{"text":"Always pleased with this place. Never had a sloppy, not fresh or poorly made pizza. It's always top notch and good. Keep up the good work. Don't be like little Ceasars they are crap"}
{"text":"This location leaves door advertisements on my residence - even though there are multiple signs indicating \"no soliciting\" and they clearly ignore them each time.
I have contacted both the advertising agency they use and the store directly. Based on their decision to ignore my request I cannot recommend this business."}
{"text":"I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be \"The Home of the Flavored Crust\" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large \"Cheese Pizza\" and a large \"1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza\" as well \"Asiago Howie Bread\" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online."}
{"text":"I've had food from this Hungry Howie's a few times.  There were 2-3 times a couple years ago (both delivery and carry-out.)  The experience was never great, just ok.  It never left me wanting more.

I decided to give them another try because I had a \"free large 1 topping\" promo in my email.  I ordered a deep dish 2 topping pizza and paid the difference.  I also picked up a side of chicken nuggets and dessert brownies.  

I ordered online and the confirmation screen told me it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I stopped by Harris Teeter on my way to get the pizza and didn't get there until about 35m later.  The gentleman said that it would be a few more minutes, so I sat down and played on my phone.

He brought the order to the counter for a total of 45-50m.  If I was in a hurry this would have been disappointing, but I was not.

The food was decent.  Chicken nuggets were ok.. tasted like Tyson/Banquet chicken that you'd get at the grocery store and bake in the oven.  The brownies were a smaller serving than I expected and they were chilled, but did not taste bad.

The pizza was pretty good.. I like the deep dish / Detroit style.  It was a bit greasy as expected, but the flavor and crunchiness were satisfactory.  I probably won't go back just because a Domino's is about 3x closer and has consistently exceptional results.  Thanks Hungry Howie's."}
{"text":"Great pizza, the problem is that any time I ask for extra pineapple, it appears as if I'm asking for the opposite. I will give more stars if you guys improve on your orders. I do come back because of the great flavor and quality but please follow the order."}
{"text":"I visit this location often and always receive awesome service. Every employee I have dealt with has been super friendly and are quick to greet you when you walk in. Sometimes early in the day when there are less employees working I will notice that they will pause what they are doing in the back and rush to the front to assist you as quickly as possible, always greeting you with a smile. 

The pizza is great quality for the price you pay. The cheese is 100% mozzarella and the crust is amazing, I prefer the garlic herb+butter cheese. They always have it made and out quickly each time. 

10/10 this is the best pizza you will find on campus. And good luck finding a place closer that will match or beat the prices."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give negative stars I would. Order over an hour before the delivery time but after 80 minutes I decided to call and find out an ETA. After sitting on hold for almost 10 minutes I was told that my order was on its way. It's funny because I never even told the girl what order I was waiting on. She said the delivery time was an hour because of how busy they were and the fact that they were short on drivers. Well it's a 5 minute drive and I had been waiting over 90 minutes by this point. When the driver finally arrived I got no apology until I mentioned how late he was. Was again I got a generic response about how busy they are and \"I just deliver the food.\" Once I got the food it was obvious that our pizza had been sitting for quite awhile. Cold is an understatement!! After reading the other reviews it's amazing that this location is still open."}
{"text":"How is this place still open? 
Yet another year has passed....and they still haven't gotten it together! 
I ordered online and only after I paid did I get informed it would be 65 min to get my order....they should state that before accepting payment so I can decide if I want to wait that long.  
The one star is only for the delivery guy.  Super nice, friendly, and I can tell he was working hard. 
Our pizza was ew...and NOT CUT. Who doesn't cut their pizza??? I know this wasn't cause they were in a hurry....obviously. It took 68 min for our uncut pizza to arrive."}
{"text":"We got a coupon to try Hungry Howie's pizza and used it for a free medium pizza. It was pretty good. The sauce and cheese were a bit skimpy, but the jalapeños had a great kick! The flavored crust is fluffy and chewy, just right for a pizza! The gentlemen working there were all very pleasant and the best part of getting dinner there. If you're going to have a chain pizza, I can say that this location of Hungry Howie's will satisfy and please you."}
{"text":"Talk about lucky!!  Tried to order from another local pizza joint, but it was closed so on a whim I called this place.  The really cool thing is that they actually offer a variety of crust flavors, like jalapeno, or garlic......went for just plain this time.  The peperoni was a tad on the greasy side, but hey....it's meat!  Also ordered a Hawaiian and it was superb!!

Great pizza, quick service, will def go back!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.

I called in for one of their specials opted in for the delivery option.
First off they put me on hold about 6 times just for a pizza order.
I had to give my address to 3 different guys because apparently no one knows WTF they're doing!!! Lastly after I was finally able to place my order, one of the workers called me half an hour later saying that I was out of their delivery area. Like really? You didn't know I was out of your area after I gave you guys my address 3 Fing Times!!! PIZZA HUT HERE I COME!"}
{"text":"First time order: placed online pizza order, pretty easy to navigate, pretty good menu and variety of ingredients to choose from. Order took about 35 mins., just in time for the game. Loved the pizza, the crust, veggies and flavor! The delivery guy was pretty friendly. The only suggestion is to provide napkins, Parmesan or crushed peppers. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I just called to get a delivery. I was a little surprised by the time and stuttered for a moment and one of the employees said to me, and I quote \"It is f***ing New Years and I need to f***ing know if you are going to order\" I have never been so rudely treated in my life. I cannot believe this. Terrible service and the fact an employee would cuss me out on the phone for pausing for a second? I am astonished."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.   I've been eating here since they opened.  However, every single time I order I have to tell them the price is WRONG. I always purchase the same thing so I  know the cost.  They always \"find\" the correct price when I remind.  Today I tried to call in my order and I was on hold the entire ride there so I hung up. When I arrived,  I saw no pizzas in the warmer and I was the only one there.  The employees all appeared to be waiting for something to do, so I was a bit annoyed.  I am rating them a 5 because they are the best snd I have never received poor service."}
{"text":"My friends raved about Hungry Howie's Pizza, because they have flavored crust. Ranch, cheese, butter cheese (huh?), garlic, and maybe some other flavors that I'm forgetting but too lazy to find out about. 

I don't usually eat my crust. It's just one of those things, so I figured if I could eat my pizza crust here, then I would give it a high rating. 

I've heard about Hungry Howie's, but have never eaten it, because apparently the closest location is in Santee, and I don't venture to the Santee area on a normal basis. Like, ever. So, we ordered 3 pizzas, 3 flavored crusts: Ranch, Garlic, and Cheese. 

Ranch crust = salty as all hell. I ate one of my pizza crusts, but drank half of my bottle of water afterwards. 

Cheese crust = fine. Nothing awesome about it. 

Garlic crust = deliciousness. 

I would say the actual pizza is equivalent to Round Table. Which, is not a bad thing at all. 

I would also say that....I would order pizza from here again....If there was a location even remotely close to me in CA. Wait, I won't be living in CA anymore, so maybe I still have a chance."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas and cheesy bread and 3 ranches to be delivered to my work at 415pm on a Tuesday. Called them back at 525 because I hadn't received my order. The girl said \"I don't see your order or have it here. It must be out for delivery give it another 5-10 minutes. I said it's been over an hour but ok. At 550pm the delivery guy came with my order minus the ranches. He said he would go back and get them. I said don't worry about it it's been almost 2hrs waiting on my order which is cold already. He said well it's 39. And some change but I could remove the ranches I said no gave him the money and said I will never order here again.... 
Horrible service next time I'll just order from Dominos or Genos....."}
{"text":"Great pizza, try the deep dish with onion crust (delicious!)

Sandwiches are alright, salads are gigantic, wings are decent as well.  

Delivery comes fast, these guys don't mess around.  I would've given 5 stars, but there's been a few order flubs in the past - if you're ordering delivery, please ensure they read the order back to you before placing it.  Not that this happens often, but once is one too many times in my book."}
{"text":"Last night I ordered my friends and I some pizza. I opened the box to find a short black hair laying there. The pizza did arrive on time and the delivery guys are always nice but seeing the hair made me lose my appetite. Hopefully this isn't a common occurrence."}
{"text":"It is my favorite pizza delivery place hands down. The cheese is fresh and they offer a variety of unique toppings like red onions and feta even meatballs. The best part is the flavored crust it makes what's normally the least flavorful part of the pizza the best part. You gotta try the Cajun crust for a little kick!"}
{"text":"The manager of this location, Chase, is the rudest person I've ever had any customer service experience with. They accepted my Postmates order, but didn't send it to the kitchen, so the person who was picking it up had to wait 20+ minutes while they made it. When they delivered it to me, the order was completely wrong. There were pieces missing as well as there being an ingredient I am allergic to on my pizza. I called to tell them this and the manager told me it wasn't his fault that pieces were missing from my order. He also told me that I need to learn how to read to see what is on the pizza. I duplicated a previous order that did not have the ingredient on it. Instead of taking responsibility for his mistake, he proceeded to call me stupid. He berated me over the phone for his own mistake. I will never patronize this location again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the pizza I got from this place was not what I would call good. I like hungry howies every now and then but this place must of put a cup of grease on it after it was baked. I just wish they were consistent at every location with quality."}
{"text":"Ordered at 9:08

Called at 10:10...said another 20 minutes

Its 11:08

Still no effin pizza

A BIG *uck you!!



I had to call back and ask for a refund


I pay up front.....have to wait 3 to 5 days for refund"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Hungry Howie's since undergrad at ASU (like 2011). I've even brought them business from my job at the community college and different Clubs. I ordered a pizza from them and my pizza got delivered burnt. I even took a picture of it. I called the business and a lady answered and told me they would credit the phone number on my account. Well I just came in and there was no credit on my account. Then the manager tells me I need to have my receipt and why would I have that!? She told me that I would have a credit so I didn't keep that receipt. I even offered to show my card's account for the transaction. I showed him the burnt pizza WITH THEIR FAMOUS YELLOW BOX, but nothing. I was hungry so I paid for the food I just ordered but.....that may be the last. THAT'S HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I'M HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED considering that I've given them business for years.... Maybe just me as one individual doesn't matter. But that's a bad mentality to have. Maybe I'll discuss that with the owner the next time he is there since I've worked with him before."}
{"text":"Received a message from someone accidentally deleted it before I could reply. I wasn't making fun of your weight,  clearly you didn't read my review. How you would feel if you went to a food establishment and was served by someone who's stomach was hanging out of their shirt? Not good right? I'm sorry you took it as a personal attack but I promise it wasnt. I was just unsatisfied with your service, that's all. Nothing personal whatsoever."}
{"text":"Where do I begin....I love love love pizza and for a chain Hungry Howies is spot on. My favorite by far is the double pepperoni deep dish with extra sauce. It is very flavorful and for the price cant go wrong. The regular pizzas are also good I do recommend extra sauce with a flavored crust such as cajun, its delicious! 

The store is small but clean. Location is very easy to get in and out of. Employees have always been friendly. This is my go to place for fast, affordable and convenient pizza!

Just as a side note and comparison...my other favs non chain are Grimaldis, Pizza Rock, Five50 (inside Aria), and Old School (love the dough)."}
{"text":"I just ordered from them, and they are speedy, and our delivery driver was super nice. She was so pleasant and friendly that we want to order again! 

Delicious food, we love the bbq wings, and the garlic butter crust is delicious."}
{"text":"Very tasty, never had a problem til tonight. One of our medium pizza with ranch crust had ranch allllll over half of the pizza that I can scrape it off.. When I complained to Wendy and asked her to speak to the person making pizza she says she didnt know who was on the line. Their pizzas are made salty. I said no iys flabored crust not flavor the crust and pizza. The other half and other pizza we ordered was fine. I asked if I can email her my complaint along with the picture and she asked me to bring the pizza back. It was 10pm, with 3 kids at home this was not an option and thats why I prefer email. I asked if she even care and she says.their manager has left already. Dead ends everywhere. I get a free pizza but it was not the point.  I posted the picture with some ranch Ive scraped off with my finger. #hungryhowies #badcustomerservice #badleadership #flavoredcrust #usuallygreat #toosalty #toomuchseasoning #pizzafail"}
{"text":"I like the pizza. They're decently priced and convenient for where I live. But dear sweet baby Jesus the location on 48th and Chandler is so poorly run it makes me want to scream. The delivery service is ridiculous. Last time I had them forget my order, not telling me they were over an hour behind, then sent a guy to my place with one pizza that wasn't even mine, and he gave my two pizzas to someone else. They fixed it, after j went back in, thankfully. The driver wanted me to take that pizza just to get it off his hands, but I said no. Thankfully it got resolved, but it should not have taken two hours in the early afternoon. This store is so woefully understaffed it's insane. One driver, one making pizzas, one running around trying to pick up the pieces. It would be comical if I wasn't hungry and had kids to feed, waiting at home because delivery times were stupid long. 
Fix the staffing and this place will be awesome. If it's the management not hiring people to save money, then shame on them. Anyway, this place is so frustrating."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM A MANAGER (Chris) I placed an online order, received a conformation E Mail that it would be delivered in 30 minutes and after I had to place a call 1hour and 22 minutes later I quickly found out three things... I wasn't ever getting my order, The customer service at this particular facility was horrendous, and the manager of the facility (Chris) or so that is who he claimed to be was unbelievably RUDE and had no customer service skills at all! I asked for the corporate office number, he refused to give it to me stating this was not his fault then started to argue with me. I'm not sure if you realize it or not, but there is plenty of other options out there from a pizza, wing, breadstick perspective and when someone chooses to eat HH, you should feel privileged and do what you can to take care of your customers or you may not have to worry about having customers soon. I run a QSR concept, just a little advice...Customer Service is paramount in this day and time, again when someone chooses to eat with you, IT's A PRIVILEGE and you probably should not take it for granted. I know moving forward, my family, friends, etc. will be much more selective when it comes to our pizza choice."}
{"text":"Tables & the floor looked oily & dirty.
I walked out of the store without ordering.
I can't imagine they would bother to keep inside kitchen area clean."}
{"text":"The service was so slow, ordered my pizza at 5:55 pm i didn't get it until 7:30pm. I was really disappointed, they didn't bother to call or update me with my order."}
{"text":"Medium Veggie pizza with garlic crust. Mighty tasty if you ask me and only $10. Take out/delivery, sure is quick. Def better than the many other chain store pizza choices in the surrounding plazas (Little Caesars and Pizza hut). 

Physical location is small, located somewhere between Harris Teeter and New Zealand Cafe, and parking is plentiful. Also, many coupons to be had."}
{"text":"they use yelp to get people  in the door then they tell you something  else.they tell me that \"they\" did not put the coupon on yelp. well who did it the tooth fairy? if they lie about  this  what  else  do  they lie about?  stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked in on a Friday night and ordered a large pepperoni pizza. Brianna told me it would be 10 minutes, so I sit down. After waiting 25 minutes, I was given my pizza. I'm almost positive the only reason I got it then was because someone else walked in to pick up their food & she saw me again. This is after her and two gentlemen in the back talked crap about the delivery guy (he had just made an appearance to pick up more deliveries). All while I was sitting in the front. I take pizza home, open it, & find not what I ordered. I got a half pepperoni, half cheese. Normally I wouldn't be mad, but the receipt clearly says pepperoni. Disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Had some bad experiences here especially inside the spots but the deliveries are always on time as far as I can recall and the best part is they never give us a bad pizza.  I've had some mixed up orders, but the best part of this location is the food was always made great.  We stick to delivery and Appreciate the coupons and deals Hungry Howies has to offer"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I called and went to place an order yesterday and was told I could not use my employee discount as I don't work at that store. I said other stores let me use my discount and the manager told me that his boss \"doesn't like employees using their discounts\". I guess this is what I expect from a place that has previously messed up my order and then when calling said that I could have it free next time, and upon trying to take them up on it there was \"nothing in the system\" so there's nothing they could do. Avoid this Hungry Howie's at all costs."}
{"text":"I actually spoke to the GM about a coupon that was listed through their online order menu off of the corporate website.  They stated that they WIILL NOT honor what was listed online.  At this point, I have dealt with this location on numerous occasions and they do not care about customer service. Quite frankly, they are taking advantage of the college area that they are in.  Here's the deal, in tempe there are more people who are not students and value the businesses that are in our city, but if you are here to take advantage of the core of our community, which is our students, you do not deserve the business.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  You are terrible business owners and should wake up to the fact that this is a community and you decided to be part of it.  So honor your company and what they represent.  I will be reporting your behavior to your corporate office, as I am sure they are not aware of your lack of professionalism.  I grew up in Detroit, where this company came from and I know that they would never stand for this."}
{"text":"Lived down the street from this place for almost 4 years and never got around to trying them. Finally did and we think they have Yummy pizza! And it was done Fast! Love that they have a \"hot box\" to keep the pizza hot until it's picked up (unlike some places that just set it on the counter or near the oven). The flavored crust was a new experience for us. we tried the asiago flavor and it was really Good! Toppings were generous and well-distributed over the crust. Fresh mushrooms were a nice surprise. We asked for the pizza to be \"well done\" - and it Was! Not used to That request being paid attention to at \"Papa J's!\" Overall - fast, well-made and Yummy! Good job, Hungry Howie's! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is always their saving grace. You can't say the same for their lack luster customer service and very late timing. 
We actually ordered through the Yelp app and it was actually really simple. I liked that they had specials to chose from. I got an email confirmation from \"eat street\" confirming the time and that they received my order. Wait time was 30-45 minutes. We waited an hour before I called to just follow up. The guy that answered said that they had gotten my order and that he doesn't know where the delivery guy was cause he left \"a while ago\". That's all he could say. So we waited another 20 minutes and finally got our pizza. The delivery guy didn't apologize but instead just had excuse after excuse. 
But I will say.... Their pizza in some of my favorite. We love the flavored crust! It's so buttery and delicious. We also got the Howie bread and it was so good too!! Thank goodness for their pizza! Otherwise I don't think they would be in business."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap pizza. Salads are large portions with plenty of veggies. Flavored crust is about the best invention ever."}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty legit. I think that the price is decent for what you get. What makes this real good is their different options for the crust.
Now the bad. The workers here are idiots! They are yelling at each other and the atmosphere put me on edge just waiting for my food. The guy on the phone when we made our order made me repeat it about 3 times. We tried this out with a coupon, told them when I called, and had to re-explain their own promotion. Luckily it isn't hard to make pizzas. 
I would tell you to try this out, but don't expect much from the employees....
UPDATE: we have come back a few times and their service seems to have gotten better. The pizza is legit here."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, tasted a lot like Peter piper. Just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat. Crust was super super salty. There are many other pizza places I would eat at before I would get this. Jimmy and joes pizza blows this away. If you looking for just okay pizza at a good price this is for you."}
{"text":"Great food. I'm a huge fan of the seasoned crust. Kinda sad the can never help with community projects like many other local businesses."}
{"text":"For the price the pizza is pretty good.  Howie bread is very good.  Not best but better than Pizza Hut.

Pizza not a good as I remember this time.  Seemed like they did not put a lot of cheese on it."}
{"text":"I'm only giving three stars because the pizza is pretty good.  The fact that my order has been messed up more than one time has me just giving them an average score.  Forget a topping, I can live with it.  Make it on a different crust as well and charge us for the things we didn't get.... Enough said.  Clean it up Hungry Howies!  I love your pizza but your employees need to learn how to read orders better!"}
{"text":"I have spent my last dollar at this location. The service is so hit or miss that it's not worth the aggravation.  A few weeks ago, my '40 minutes' delivery took 80 min. Rightfully so, the manager gave me a credit for 2 large pizzas. So, I decided to avoid the possible delivery fiasco and stopped by and placed an order for my 2 free pizzas. Not wanting to be a total freeloader, I also ordered some wings, Howie bread, and brownie. I asked the guy taking my order if I could split the wing order of 16 and get 2 flavors. The order of 16 costs $16.99, and the order of 8 runs $8.99. So, instead of ringing me up for an order of 16, Tanner rang me up for 2 orders of 8 wings, thus squeezing that extra $1.01 out of me. Additionally, at no point did I ask for ranch, nor was I asked if I wanted ranch or blue cheese. Tanner just decided that I wanted ranch, and rang me up for 2 ranches @ $.59 each. So after tax, my order of 2 free pizzas, 16 wings, bread, and a brownie, my order totaled $30.35. Even worse than the dollar amount, I was told \"about 15-20 minutes\". I waited. And waited. Keep in mind the ENTIRE time I was in there a total of 3 people came in and got food and left. After about 25 minutes, someone from the back came out and asked what I was waiting for. I'm pretty sure this is when my order was made, seeing how a typical pizza oven takes 7 minutes to cook a pie. Too bad I have to tell my kids that Hungry Howie's is no longer an option. It's just not worth the aggravation."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza. Flavored crust is bomb. When we call in and order everything typically goes great. I've tried to used the yelp eat app and every time I do something gets messed up. The last time it took an hour and a half for us to get our pizza when we were projected with a 30-40 minute wait time. Hopefully they can get this convenient issue resolved."}
{"text":"Anti-pasta salad was delivered with out dressing.  If you going to play in the delivery world, it has to be perfect every time.  The appetizers that I ordered my kids were mediocre."}
{"text":"I would never order a pizza from a company that's idea of advertising is throwing garbage in my front yard."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium cheese pizza last night and had it delivered however there was a problem with my street adress; someone had taken down the wrong information and the driver ended up in the wrong location, i called and spoke to the manager on duty and he quickly offered to have a pizza sent to my home free of charge along with a large bottle of Pepsi and a huge order of bread sticks, needless to say I was impressed and the pizza was fresh hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"This pizza is a go-to since I am the mother of a pizza crazed child. He loves the flavored crust, the cinnamon sticks and he actually eats their pizza. Nothing fancy, but reasonably priced and always available to deliver. We always order off of the Hungry Howies app to see the current deals, they are not always listed publicly, but are always on their website and app for all local stores. 

Yay pizza!"}
{"text":"So I ordered 4 pizzas 3 crusts were wrong and a pizza we ordered with pepperoni was plain so we called the store and my girlfriend talked to the assistant manager Rob and asked if we could get the right pizza delivered because we ordered delivery (we don't have a car) we even offered to give the pizza back with one slice taken out and the guy was an asshole and called her a bitch over the phone and offered nothing to fix the problem after being a long time customer im never going back and I will be talking to corporate. Completely unacceptable do not recommend."}
{"text":"Pizza and cheese bread were outstanding! Staff was professional and greeted us upon arriving and friendly! Great job."}
{"text":"Had this place on my To Do List for some time now.....finally decided to pop in for lunch.  I ordered a \"well done\" Small Veggie w/Butter Cheese Crust (Tomatoes, Mushrooms, Onions, Olives, Green Peppers, $9.99).

I was curious what the Butter Cheese Crust was all about.....after I got the Pizza I realized that they brush Butter and sprinkle Parmesan Cheese on the edge of the Crust....ok, got it.  The Pizza was OK, not great.  I don't know, it didn't leave me wanting more....I know a Pizza is good when I can finish off a Small Pizza and feel like I can eat another....but this one didn't leave me with that feeling.

Here's a tip....if you decide you want to dine in the restaurant, like I did, they only have 2 Liter Bottles of Soda, so if you're not in the mood to fill your bladder, bring your own drink.  Also, bring your own napkins too.....I couldn't find any in the eating area.....weirdness.

10.83 for a large one topping pizza, plus a delivery fee (which I expected). Not 5.00. It's over triple the price. No thanks!"}

{"text":"The prices are good, if they actually make your order right.  We used to order from different hungry howies all the time, but we went to this one and they didnt make our order right.  We called to let them know and they basically said we were lying.  They made it seem like I was trying to get free food out of them.  When I'm used to ordering from them 1-2 times a week, I know what I want when ordering from them, but won't be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Meh. I mean it's not terrible. Prices are ok. Service is ok. Pizza is ok (pretty greasy though). I did like the option of the different flavored crusts. We went with the garlic herb. It was ok. Other options were Cajun, parmesan, jalepeno, and a few others. The decor gives me anxiety. Way to much yellow but I guess that's a HH signature I suppose.

Nothing really to write home about."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Ordered a pizza online at 2:01 received a confirmation email that it would be here within 40 minutes. At 2:56 still no pizza. I was hoping to eat something quick before I headed to work. I finally called the store and canceled my order. The manager informed me they had no way of letting the driver know so just let him know I cancelled the order. Guy didn't show up till 3:15 a whole 35 min past the quoted time. Worse of all there is a similar comment with the same experience from a month ago. Sounds like this might happen a lot.....

{"text":"OK...

I know I review a lot of pizza joints....well - I like Pizza.

I do...like it, pizza is good...for any occasion.

So---here we are staring at a chain restaurant that delivers exactly what it should. Always...excellent service, consistent delicious products, and a clean facility. 

The first hook is the the  flavored crust!

 Hungry Howie's is the original flavored crust pizza.  They sport 8 flavored Crust pizzas ( and they can mix'm up too if you are a nice salivating patron).

Also, you can order Howie Bread ( ohh damn its good..covered is spices and Parm:dry style cheese), Howie Wings (ok) , Calzone Style Subs ( The best frikken item I have ordered from this exceptional chain!!!), 3-Cheese Bread( cheesier Howie bread: wet style w/Mozzarella etc)

And

Salads.....antipasto


Salad?

Really...do you wear your goat-leggings to church on Easter morning?

WTF!!!!!

Order more cheese bread..with the included marinara sauce chaser...are you eat'n like a splendid fool or nibbling like grazing rabbit???????geesh....but I digress.

I love the sesame crust or garlic/herb ( w/ some sesame please !!!!YUM)

The pizza is yeasty, the real proof- to- rise, and toss stuff...with cornmeal treatment to the bottom, saucy too.

All Items can be ordered with their \"spicy\" pizza sauce...It is awesome, but I'm gettin' old and don't want to add the price of a bottle of Tums to my order.

The open kitchen and dining area. bathrooms and EVERYTHING is spotless. ( and a bit dated IE:  Sexy 1980's  Flock-Of-Seagulls - Ah-Ha  decor)

...so........

you have a problem with bright yellow decor and molded plastic laminate booths that you actually slide out of on occasion like a toboggan run?

Wear your pleather pants ( like I do when I come to dine)

No Problems.

ahh...oh..,

anyway....

Take out is quick and easy!

The Calzone-Subs are the total draw...They are basically a small pizza, ( dough crust flavors apply here also) stuffed with goodness, and folded in half.

So absolutely delish.

I love the steak/mushroom/cheese..with mayo, oil..melted, then finished with some lettuce and tomato.

Cost about $5.!!!!

This place also has a \"happy hour\" special, where you pay the time on the clock when you order between 4:30-6:00 pm. ( IE: call at 5:30 and pay $5.30 for a medium 1 topping pie)


Go here...eat much pizza...maybe get a \"calzone sub\" for the drive home, and 2-3 pizzas for later....

When I visit Cleveland, This a must-stop before I leave town

Howie....oh fictional heart-congesting \"what-me-worry\"  Poster Child of Pizza-

I applaud you."}
{"text":"The boneless wings were good but bad value. $5 for 5 wings. I can get some spicy nuggets at Wendy's for a $1 and they would be almost better than what I had at hungry howies. They should rethink their pricing."}
{"text":"I chose this store for an order of over 100 personal pizzas & a ton of wings for a meeting. The manager (Shawn??) was incredible, offered me a deal right off the bat, kept in touch and threw in some cinnamon bread. They even delivered in 2 shifts so nothing had to sit around and it stayed hot. Very happy, will use these guys again."}
{"text":"The people who work here are very friendly! I never had a bad experience. They're polite when things take a little longer than usual but my orders are usually done before the time they give. 

Upon moving to north Las Vegas I shortly discovered hungry howies and their phenomenal flavored crust!! Their garlic and herb crust is second to none! I get a large pepperoni with garlic and herb crust! So freaking good! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always hot and delicious with the perfect combo of toppings, cheese, sauce and we LOVE the garlic crust. Bummed they changed their coupon policy for pick up only."}
{"text":"I love Hungry Howies for a couple reasons-

cajun crust
CHEAP
fast
hot wing sauce
3 cheesier bread 

and of course, deliciousness.


this place gets my pizza ready in about 15 minutes...bad thing is they don't deliver past 24th street...

always very friendly, prompt, clean, and i have never been disappointed. you'll never eat another dominos pizza again!"}
{"text":"My son got a free pizza from school so decided to give it a try we came in last week and services was good very nice guy did the order and pizza was out in less the 10 mins! So i thought it was okay. I give it another try and oreder a biger order! And same everything good. Not the best pizza but for the price is really good and great services! I see a lot of back reviews wich had me worry so hope i get a free pizza after this review"}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok. I ordered double cheese. If there was double cheese I couldn't tell the difference from a regular pizza. I can't tell you if the cheese was good because there was hardly any on the pizza. Very disappointing. I'll try another place for my next pizza. I ordered the butter garlic crust. It was very good. That was really the tastiest part of the pizza. I don't get pizza for the crust."}
{"text":"This location is run with class! a college town, late night, inexpensive but BOMB delivery and take-out. You would think customer service wouldn't be so important to them but when I ordered a pizza late at night for delivery, the assistant manager realized orders were becoming delayed and took it upon himself to start delivering so the customer wouldn't be disappointed with the wait. Not all hungry howies are run like this... I praise your teamwork y'all! Way to go ;)"}
{"text":"$5 for a large 1 topping pizza with a choice of differnt tasting crusts? Yep, it's great!"}
{"text":"My pizza was wrong. Again.
It was supposed to be half cajun/ranch crust, and the other half butter cheese/ranch.
The cajun/ranch side is always fine, except the cajun seasoning ends up on the entire thing, with no butter cheese or ranch on the other half.
I also ordered butter cheese only howie bread, but was given cajun.


Was stoked to move so close to a Hungry Howie's location (especially one that is open until 5am!)
But.. thus far I've been disappointed with multiple orders. 

I'm generally not one to leave negative reviews because mistakes happen. 
But when mistakes are the rule rather than the exception it becomes rather annoying."}
{"text":"First time there and last!! Had to wait 20 min on phone to order, then when i got there, another 10 min while guy was on phone! After all that, had one bite of this soggy cardboard pizza and threw rest away!! Even my dog would not eat this crap!!!!"}
{"text":"They have been reopened for a year or more.Average food at a cheap price.  Not bad if you are hungry and lazy like i sometimes am."}
{"text":"My order was ready wrong but worker fixed it right away! Awesome job great customer service . 5star!"}
{"text":"Not great. If you like little Caesar's or Pizza Hut. It's the same. Not real pizza the brownies are great"}
{"text":"Ordered  pizza for delivery. It was kind of a long wait. About 1 hour 20 minutes.
Pizza came piping hot and salad was fresh.
I ordered the garlic herb crust and really had great flavor and put the pizza over the top.
Extra cheese is a must! Great mozarella and robust tomato sauce.
The salad was really big for the price and chock full of salamu, cheese, and fresh veggies. I only received 2 little ranch cups which was not even close to enough.
Really tasty pizza, but it might be faster to pick up instead of delivery."}
{"text":"Forgot to post this the other night... It wasn't even near closing time and our food still came out shitty. I ordered buffalo boneless wings and they were HARDLY covered in sauce. Our breadsticks were sliced half-ass. They're lucky the pizza came out decent. Such a disappointment to HH's everywhere."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza with a wonderful staff!!! We got a BBQ chicken pizza and added pineapple and it was the bomb.com
This particular location is the best in AZ."}
{"text":"Only bad thing is very small seating area. Crusts are amazing, I had garlic herb. Large $5 can't beat it. I can tell their business is 90% delivery but I'd still stop by and pickup again!"}
{"text":"So I order a pizza and I always ask for ranch and they never ever bring me the ranch that I have to pay for. Not only does the pizza take 1 hour to get there, but they never bring me the ranch. Very mad about this when you pay for something your supposed to get it I work very hard to get money, and I'm done with this place. I can't complain about the pizza because it is good but the customer service sucks."}
{"text":"You place an order on their app, the app says it's ready, show up 25 minutes later and they haven't even cooked it yet! Yep I'm a little irritated so I say, \"what's the delay?\" Girl reply's, \"we're busy\" I tell her that's no excuse but you can make it up with a 10% discount. \"Sorry, we don't give out discounts\"  she said I can talk to the manager but I've just decided to make this my last visit. Don't say the order is ready when you haven't even made it yet..."}
{"text":"Typical cheap pizza joint. I ordered for pick up and my pizzas were ready 5mins sooner than quoted. The flavored crust is always nice to try. We did spicy Cajun and it had a nice kick to it. We also got some ranch and buffalo sauce-- mix them together for dipping-- to add some spicy to our pizza. Just did the medium cheese pizzas for $5 each. Honestly though it'd be nice if they had the pepperoni medium pizzas for $5 too."}
{"text":"Good for delivery and take out. I had a large pepperoni pizza with garlic herb crust. It tasted like pizza on garlic bread :)) It was very tasty."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this pizza place. I decided on here because they offered gluten free pizza. Worst gluten free pizza I have ever had!  Pizza crust was hard and burned. 
I had ordered online and waited 25 minutes before going and still had to wait additional 10 minutes for my pizza.  On top on that I had order mild wings, 8 wings. I received 7. I asked why and was told they weigh the wings now. Um your web site and menu does not say that. I asked for manager, he told me the same thing and said it was because people were complaining about the size. But \"This time he would give me 8.\" And it would take a few more minutes. 20 minutes later I ask about my wings and told they were going thru the oven again. Another 10 minutes I was handed back the same box I handed them with 7. I said um there still 7 and thats when I was told they gave my mild away for another order to driver and would make me another order. Take in mind I have been here for 40 minutes not counting the 25 I waited after placing order online. Then they said they could give me the order of HOT wings in place if I didn't want to wait. So I took them. I asked to keep the 7 for the time I had to wait and it was a hug 5-7 minute debate over that! 
At no time was sorry said, anything offered for my inconvenience.  I am not impressed with customer service or the food. 


Update: Per request of HH I went to website and submitted information as requested and yet to hear anything."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town and we were looking for a nearby pizza place for carryout. I hadn't ever been to Hungry Howies, so decided to give this place a try... and after the one time, I think I'm done. The service was poor- a few high school aged kids that required me to repeat myself several times to get the order straight, and took 5 minutes to run a credit card through the register. The pizza itself was terrible as well. We opted for the original crust (they have flavors like parmasean cheese and garlic). It was a pan-style crust, but was hard as a rock... it might have required a trip to the dentist for a chipped tooth if I had tried any harder to bite into it.

If you're looking for carry-out, try Rosatis"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good considering the price, but I have to agree the service here sucks.  I was on my way to a friend's house and I wanted to grab some take out for us.  This is in my neighborhood and in the direction of my friends house so location was the deciding factor here. I walked up and ordered with a gal in the front and was told about fifteen minutes, which is not too bad.  So I sat down and waited.  And waited.  And listened to the cashier whine about her personal problems as her conversation echoed through the store, and waited.  At the twenty five minute mark I started to pace around.  Finally some guy comes from the back and asks me my name.  Turns out my pizza had been sitting in a warmer for God knows how long while I sat in the lobby waiting.  That beyond pisses me off.  Maybe while your crying about your life, you could, I don't know, also pay attention to what is going on too.  I don't know it might be too much to ask for.  I'll skip this place in the future."}
{"text":"I get this pizza all the time the flavor is one of a kind and the flavored crust just makes it that much better! A must try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"New to Arizona and have noticed this seems to be a chain of pizza places here so we decided to give it a try. Ordered online and it was very fast and prompt. Pizza came nice and hot and was actually pretty good! Love the added crust flavor- it's so much better than Pizza Hut. Cheese bread was amazing."}
{"text":"We got a free large 1 topping pizza coupon in the mail since I moved recently and decided to give it a try last night. I called my order in and the guy who answered was rude and curt. I told him what I wanted and he took my phone number and I was being polite the whole time. He was talking fast and sounded like he was trying to end the call before I could put anything else in. I had already told him I wanted the pizza so I told him before he could end the call that I also wanted the cinnamon bread and he gave me more attitude and said, \"did you want to order another pizza?\" I was confused since I didn't mention another pizza and had asked for something else so I asked him to repeat. He raised his voice and gave me an attitude and this time said, \"did you still want the pizza?\" I said yes please but throughout the call he was very unpleasant and rude. I didn't want to deal with it anymore and had a feeling I'd only continue having issues with them. I told him never mind I didn't want a pizza from them after all and hung up. 

Forget the free pizza, service was horrible and not worth it. I paid for pizza from somewhere else instead. That coupon is going in the trash, free or not, horrible service makes me wonder what they will do to my food. I'm surprised that a place with horrible service like this is still open."}
{"text":"My initial thought was..... \"15 dollars for two pizzas, can't beat that!\" 
Come to find out my 6 year old daughter just had this with her father the weekend before we did. 
She was so sick from it she threw up. I asked her about the last time she ate it along with her dad and both confirmed she had been sick the first time as well. 

Don't bother if you have children. If not don't bother unless you have an iron stomach or need to loose 5 lbs."}
{"text":"As a frequent customer of this hungry howies I felt like it took a lot to get me to write a negative review since we order all the time but never will again after experiencing the worst last of customer service from this location. Called when we had a medium pizza, house bread, and a salad delivered.. literally 0.5 miles down the road by the way... tipped the guy $5 as well as the delivery fee and when we called to say the salad was wrong got put around the ringer talking to multiple people INCLUDING the chef who started arguing with me asking what was wrong with the salad and then saying you can bring it back I'm like ok so we paid delivery fee and tipped good especially for being around the corner could you just make it right and send it back and that was a no go he wanted to know what EXACTLY was wrong with the salad. So 1st of all it was ordered as a chef salad with ranch we got a half empty side salad with Cesar dressing so I said it's missing all the ingredients such as ham, mozerella, etc basically these people put me around the ringer talking to multiple people arguing with me about what was wrong and not ONCE ever just saying I'm sorry we will send someone right over with the right salad our bad. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"This Hungy Howie's locations sucks.  I have given it 3 chances, and every single time, they have somehow messed up my order.  I ask for no green peppers, they put peppers on all except 2 pieces.  That is not half.
I pay extra for sauce, they do not deliver.
I went in 1 day to pick up and every person there seemed rude and terrible at their job.
Don't eat here."}
{"text":"If you're hungry I suggest you try Howie's. Why? Because it is sooooo good!  A major upgrade to Little Caesars this pizza joint has way more to offer. 

Last night was my second time in and I am highly impressed.  Since I was in the area I decided to place a phone order. The gentleman who answered after a long winded scripted answering service was super friendly. He was patient with me and my many questions as I am not yet a regular. I placed an order for Howie Bread which he said would take 10 minutes. Once I got there my food was piping hot and ready. Except for the sauce which was cold? Maybe that is how they provide the dipping sauce?  The gentleman that took my order was the same person who rang me up. Very nice and thanked me for coming in. 

The establishment is very small as it is mainly a pick or delivery location. There are two tables that will seat two people at each table at a time. The yellow pizza joint was nice and clean. I will be back based on the experience and the fantastic taste from the food they offer. Check out there menu as they offer salads, wings, and more."}
{"text":"BBQ Chicken pizza is really good.  Had the antipasta salad.  The cheese was good, ingredients were fresh except the lettuce was a old, not too bad but one more day would've been bad. Even though I ordered at noon on Friday delivery still came within 30 minutes.  I would order from here again.  Heads up tho... they charge $3.50 for delivery, so might want to pick it up."}
{"text":"I like it here. They deliver pretty quickly and always have some good specials going on. Wings are spicy and the sauce gets all over... they don't skimp on the toppings, and the flavored crust is pretty awesome, too. Chicken strips are just that, nothing to write home about but they're pretty big. Salads aren't bad, either. I had a sandwich once, or was it a calzone? anyway, that was kinda weird, philly cheesesteak on the inside supposedly... won't be ordering that again. But yeah, this is my go-to place for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"We get pizza from here 3-5 times a month, and they have yet to disappoint!"}
{"text":"Had two calzones and  large pizza.   Reminded me of the HH back home in Michigan.   Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is lucky enough to get 1 star. 

Place was empty when I walked in. Had the only two employees too busy on their phones to even notice my gf and I were standing there. I really just wanted some wings but when the guy finally came up to take my order, it looked like he just got done hitting his crack pipe in the bathroom... Place smelled disgusting like they haven't even been cooking food at all, all day... Horrible place. I don't see this location lasting long at all. I feel bad for hungry howies that they hire people like this to work for their company..... Don't go here. You'd be better off getting real pizza with great customer service. Like streets of New York. Or if you want good wings hit up wing heaven. But by all means avoid this place. I'd pick little ceasers over hungry howies ANYDAY..."}
{"text":"My number one pizza, for sure.  The Pepperoni is always slightly crisp around the edges, which I freakin' love.  The sauce is wonderfully flavorful and the cheese is nice and stretchy.  Butter cheese crust is quite delicious as well.  AND they always have hella cheap specials, like a large for 7 bucks.  I wish to God there was more locations!  Can't recommend enough!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza spot in the area. I enjoy their pizza much more than the others around here. They have a wide variety of pizzas and the flavored crust is great"}
{"text":"I waited the full wait time (40 min for my delivery) which isn't to bad on a Friday night. 

Got my pizza and I am NOT impressed. 1 pizza is fine, the other is burnt, and the cheese bread is so greasy it could kill ya by looking at it.

The howies on Sardis Rd is way better!"}
{"text":"Staff doesn't seem overly happy, the prices can be more competitive, I guess if you're in a pinch for a pizza it's an OK place to go"}
{"text":"First time visiting Hungry Howie's and it was a great experience. The customer service here is great. 
My family and I came in to order 6 pizzas for a party we were attending. The system at Hungry Howie's seemed to be having some issues and unfortunately the card payment wasn't going through. After a couple attempts the manger assisted and we were able to get it done. He even offered a discount to accommodate us for system processing time. The willingness to accommodate was such a kind gesture and exceeded our expectations. 
The pizza was a hit at the party as well. Decent prices. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for an awesome price! Absolutely love the flavored crust! Employees were very kind and helpful as this was only my second time ordering from Howie's. My first time ordering I went to Howie's in person and the pizza was done within a few minutes. The second time I ordered the pizza for delivery and it arrived within 25 minutes. Highly recommend Hungry Howie's Pizza!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would! Worse customer service ever! Placed an order over two hours ago.  Called and made excuses.  Hung up on me and everyone in my family.  Would not credit our order that we never received! Worse service ever! Sent a message to corporate and contacted our bank! Will never eat there again! Hope they go down in flames!"}
{"text":"My small extra cheese pizza was delicious and ready to pick up in 15 minutes, and wh I arrived I got nothing but friendly service from smiling faces. I have no complaints. I am very happy."}
{"text":"WOW!  This is some really bad pizza.  I understand if I spend money on garbage pizza and the ultra cheap places I can't complain about what I'm getting but to spend two-three times that amount for really nasty pizza is annoying.  Also, their online order app is also a joke as it still showed my pizza being made and not yet ready for pickup now 9 hours after we got it home and ate it."}
{"text":"After giving this HH location another chance significantly after my first couple of visits here, in happy to say it now matches the HH image and flavor I remember from where I used to live.

Have had many visits since then and am glad to be able to increase my rating.

Note that they don't accept Amex."}
{"text":"They're pretty good. Usually get here super fast. When they're late they're accommodating. There's nothing horrible to say here. I love hungry Howies flavored crust the butter cheese. And their extra cheese pizza-so good. You can't go wrong when you can flavor the crust! Who else does that?! I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time and totally impressed. I'm visiting my mom who lives in Peoria and we wanted food delivered. We had a turkey calzone and boneless wings and I must say we loved every bite!!! Mom will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed after ordering tonight for the first time (my boyfriend gets their food pretty frequently). The other reviews are accurate. We order online 10 bbq boneless wings, 8 asian wings, and a calzone. Boyfriend went to pick up the food, brought it home, annnnnd the bbq wings had NO SAUCE. Ugh. I don't understand how you can mess that up, especially when the store was pretty empty. Luckily, we had some sauce in our fridge so I sauced them myself and popped them in the microwave. Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hungry Howes always has the best crust, and great tasting pizza. This is the only pizza place I order from in my area, and delivery is always super quick.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This pizza walks a thin line between A-OK and drunken munchies."}
{"text":"Gross!!! A sloppy, soggy, greasy mess! Also bought wings that were half the size of normal sized wings. All for the highway robbery price of $26. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"\"Howie's\" is a local favorite for the massive population of ASU students and staff in Tempe. This location is generally pretty good on both service and delivery time. They will gladly delivery anywhere on campus, including academic buildings and residential communities. Their food is great for a quick cheap meal - their specialty flavored crust is a unique asset to your pizza experience and really steps up the game for the pizza delivery market. This unique factor about their pizza makes them a great choice when looking for a delivery pizza that isn't just from your run of the mill pizza joint."}
{"text":"Love the different flavor crusts and they had my food delivered in under twenty minutes. Howie bread is the BEST!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with Hungry Howies. :( I was excited to learn they were opening a location in this area. About 15 years ago, I used to love the location on Greenway and 32nd St. The pizza was super cheap but tasty. So I was expecting the same.

The food is still reasonably priced, especially with coupons, but the food is not great. The salad was not fresh, the dressing was disgusting and sugary. The cheese bread and the pizza were way undercooked and doughy. We had to stick it in our oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking! The sauce and toppings were bland.

I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the service was great. They were very friendly and the food was ready fast. Unfortunately, that is not enough for us to return."}
{"text":"75% of the time they mess up your order.  Out of the entire store there is only one friendly guy up front.  Everyone else acts bothered if you ask about anything.  

The pizza itself tastes good and you really can't beat the price for the pizza that's the only reason I go back, but if they could only make it the way you order?!"}
{"text":"Honestly the WORST pizza I've ever had in my life. DiGiorno's would have been better. It's like they took a cheap frozen pizza and put it in their own box. We ordered a large pepperoni with extra sauce and double cheese. There was virtually no sauce and a thin layer of cheese. And we paid $16! The cheese they use is some cheap imitation cheese. You know pizza is bad when you won't eat the leftovers the next day. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Crust was excellent with
Just the right amount of toppings. We liked the sauce which was slightly spicy. I guess the mushrooms pieces could have been larger but still very good. Order was ready in 15 minutes! No problems."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, love that its not dripping in grease, crust is amazing and the prices are great for families."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak and mushroom calzone no lettuce no tomato add bell pepper and onion. I also ordered winga with ranch. Asked the delivery driver where my ranch was. He insisted that it was in the box with the calzone, it was not. Opened my calzone box and out poures lettuce and tomato.. I called back and the lady said there was a mix up. But it had my added veggies that i ordered??? No there was no mix up it was made incorrectly. The reason i am not giving less stars is beacuse the lady i spoke with sent a new one out immediatly"}
{"text":"I had not been to Hungry Howie's for years... When I saw the sign one large one toping pizza $5.00 I had to get one. Friendly staff I ordered my pizza with jalapeños and the Cajon spice crust.  It was surprisingly a pretty good pizza... For that price if you're hungry and want some left over pizza it's a homerun."}
{"text":"Yum, thank you!!!  Always liked your pizza & salads!  Quick delivery too!  Love your crust & your pizza sauce.  Take out & delivery has always been AOK!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. A takeout pizza at a reasonable/good price. We normally order every few weeks when we have all the neighborhood kids at the house. We have not had a bad experience.  I do love the cinnamon bread."}
{"text":"Howie's = college.  
This pizza go me through.
If you order online/ easily done through the yelp app/ then you'll see how uniquely Howie's compares to other pizza joints.
Check out the well done cook option. And if your a saucy guy or gall the 3x sauce option is dope!"}
{"text":"I like this location. They were friendly and the lady offered me seasonings without me asking her. It was nice not having to beg for crushed pepper and cheese. The place looked clean. I like that they offer personal size pizza."}
{"text":"Trying to find a quick bite in the middle of a haboob (look it up,) we escaped into Hungry Howie's to get something quick but didn't want pizza.  We thought we were out of luck but we did manage to get a chicken Caesar salad and I had Asian boneless chicken wings.  We shared a diet lemonade and then braved the dust storm to get to our show nearby at the Higley Center for the Performing Arts, the 27th time I have seen a production of \"Les Miserables.\"  Food was what it was and I've had better,  but there just weren't any other choices nearby."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Hot, cheap, and filling. The delivery is great and the drivers are good folks. The food won't knock you out of your shoes, but what do you want for limbo low prices?"}
{"text":"All i ordered was a pepperoni pizza. The driver had trouble finding the place, but still made it by the estimated delivery time. We sat down immediately for dinner, and it was barely warm. Not much pepperoni, considering i ordered extra. There was however, a ridiculously thick layer of previously melted, lukewarm cheese that resulted in a grease soaked crust."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food! Amazing pizza!! Love that you can customize your crust!! Gave four stars instead of five though because sometimes the pizza is poorly cut. Like the pizza maker got lazy and really sliced the pizza so half a** that you have to slice it yourself. So other than than its my fav pizza place to order from."}
{"text":"forgot the toppings! 
Did offer credit for new one."}
{"text":"Always pleased with their service and food. Usually quicker than estimated, for example tonight it took them 35 minutes to deliver when the estimate was 60. Pretty good deals and prices for the level of customization you can have.

Only complaint was one employee was slightly rude/short during a phone order and their garlic crust is too garlicky/salty."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pepperoni pizza.  When I got home, I opened the box and was disappointed that the pepperoni was missing.  I mean seriously.  How difficult is it to get this order correct?"}
{"text":"Ordered it online for a pick up... We ordered the grilled chicken pizza and buffalo wings... Great price! Great Customer Service and food was good..."}
{"text":"If you like exceptionally greasy buttery pizza then this is the place for you! Has to be the most unhealthy pizza out there. Absolutely delicious for the first couple bites, especially with the garlic crust, but after that it's just greasy and heavy."}
{"text":"I work 1 mile from their cut off delivery point and they refused to bring my order AFTER I had already placed the order online and paid for it. I had to cancel the order. The lady on the phone was really rude when she called me."}
{"text":"Looks like someone took a handful of sausage and just threw it on my pizza.  Also, my pepperoni looked like it was made in a rush considering I have one spot with severally pepperonis stacked together.   It also looked liked it was cut by a blind person. This is just pure laziness."}
{"text":"FOOD: One of the best places to get a quick pizza! Perfect cheese:sauce:bread ratio, and you get to flavor your crust. My favorite is garlic herb, it literally makes me sit back and release a Neanderthal grunt of \"mmmmm.\" Other flavor crusts are good too, like Parmesan cheese. A medium is enough for one guy, but I have been able to down a whole large to myself (not a good idea). 

PRICE: Sadly, Howies is wayyy too expensive for take-out/delivery pizza parlor. Be sure to use the coupons they send out everywhere to find a good deal. If I didn't get coupons, I wouldn't eat at Howies because it's too expensive for a simple pizza. 

ATMOSPHERE: Don't eat at Howies, take it to go or get delivery. 

SKINNY: I get Howies almost every week! It is THE place to get pizza on week nights, but only on the day that has a huge discount coupon."}
{"text":"We got pizza at work today and it was very yummy. Good original pizza for an inexpensive price. Yipee! Sidenote: amazing crust."}
{"text":"29¢ pizza day & this location wasn't inform. Waited 2 hours for pizza because it was already paid for. Not all that worth it."}
{"text":"I'm just going to let the conversation I had with Yelp do all of the explanation of why you should never eat at this specific Hungry Howie's and hopefully the regional and district managers see this and fire whoever is trying to run that complete shitshow but a huge shout out Blaise in the Scottsdale office for at least talking to me when the restaurant wouldn't answer their phone happy birthday to me"}
{"text":"Unless you'd like an actual physical altercation from a meth head looking delivery driver, do not order delivery from this place. The driver had to wait like 2 min for us to come downstairs. Our doorbell doesn't work and he didn't call us to let us know he was here. Instead, he proceeded to scream \" your fucking pizza is here\" on the side of my house. When my boyfriend went outside, driver through a HUGE fit and told us that we made him wait and then threw our pizza on the ground and swore up and down and tried to start a fight and told us to \"never order from us again you fat piece of shit.\" So.. if you're into being called names and having your food thrown onto the ground, definitely order from this location."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and the parking lot in this little area is horrible, super packed every time I've been here. I ordered online and picked up my food.

The service here needs improvement for sure. The guy gave me my food and walked away completely neglecting my sister who was also picking up food. They don't offer you napkins, a drink, dipping sauce... nothing. 

On to the sandwich... it was delicious! Great crust, soft and fluffy. I got the chicken bacon ranch and it was very cheesy and moist. The sandwich was hot and filled with enough bacon and chicken for me. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Don't go here. It is cheap, but the food tastes awful.  My boyfriend got the Howie roll and that was nasty. Basically it was flavorless cheese in  white bread. I got a steak and mushroom calzone and  it had a bad tasting sauce.  There wasn't much flavor and the flavor that was present tasted bad."}
{"text":"We ordered our food an hour ahead of time knowing it was a busy holiday weekend  and it was still 40 mins late and cold.  No apologies from anyone and when we called the girl told us it was on the way without knowing what order we were calling about than hung up without another word.  Worst serves ever!!! Will never order from them again!!"}
{"text":"Basically always have gotten the Philly Cheese ... it is great!  I have always gone and picked it up ... have it hot and ready every time."}
{"text":"I see no comments here from the business, responding to concerns, but will write my review anyway.

I had a young lady call today on my behalf, to order 3 large pizzas.  When she hesitated on the style of the third pizza, the representative told her, \"you need to hurry, I have other orders to take.\"

I won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Waste of money spent $25.00 on a deep dish deluxe and side of Howie bread.  Very disgusted, displeased and disappointed about this delivery! Pizza was delivered cold, and doughy. The sausage and pepperoni were poor quality and undercooked.  Burnt crust around the edges and undercooked under the toppings!  They also managed to deliver hard cold howie bread that was not even buttered! Paid for extra dipping sauce I didn't get.  For a place that is only 1 mile away that charges a $3.50 delivery fee ontop of tip, and made us wait over an hour for the delivery with business like this they are doomed to fail. We couldn't even eat the undercooked pizza it was disgusting! We won't think of Hungry Howies when we want a pizza anymore."}
{"text":"Worst pizza in LKN area. Ordered delivery twice and both orders were incorrect. Pizza tastes like it was frozen. Won't be back"}
{"text":"I haven't had this locations pizza but I have had it elsewhere. Ok pizza in an extreme pinch, prices are so so for the quality."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Hungry Howie's pizza! I've been to multiple locations over the years and never had a bad experience. Delivery is always super quick and easy. They even have a tracker so you can watch how long it will take to get to you. The butter cheese crust is amazing. The dough is always perfect and the flavor is never lacking. If you're looking for a quick bite and quick delivery I'd recommend them!"}

It's absurd to believe that business is being ran this way and after several months of no communication regarding an order to then be treated like this is unacceptable. I will be shore to share my experiences with the hungry howies on state rd. 

Don't waste money!!! Find Better pizza with better service, Marcos, dominos, pizza fire etc."}
{"text":"The worst pizza place ever! And I mean the worst! We ordered 4 large pizzas and was told that it would be ready for pick up in 45 mins. We went there and was told that it was going to take another 15 minutes before it will be ready. My daughter paid for the pizzas already so we waited another 15 minutes only to be told it would take another 15. What the heck? Every time the 15 minutes would come up we were told another 15 minutes.  Overall, we were waiting for almost 2 hours for 4 large pizzas. I requested to get my money back. I will never, ever patronize this pizza house ever again! Cheap pizza, cheap service! That's what you'll get from this  place!"}
{"text":"Best dang pizza in AZ!!

WE love their Monday madness deal!
Our family favorite is the ham, and pineapple with the butter crust! YUM, YUM, YUM!!!
Can't beat the value! Anytime I can feed a family of 4 under $10 I'm happy, but to REALLY enjoy it is bliss!"}
{"text":"For cheap pizza, it's as good as it gets. More selection than the other cheap pizza places, and the quality is way better.  The wings are delicious also, especially the Cajun flavor!!! If your looking for something like one of the big chains, then go there, but this is good for the money. If you want gourmet pizza, then go pay for it, don't look for it at the bargain places.  I paid $29 for an XL pizza with two toppings and 20 wings, and everyone was happy!  Just know that it's really fast pizza, but it's better than the other big guys!"}
{"text":"Love the flavored crusts! I only get cheese so I couldn't say much on toppings."}
{"text":"So great and no place is cheaper. go with the Cajon Butter crust for a delicious though unhealthy treat. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow ordered pizza online told 40 minutes an hour later call and told it is heading out the door and hour later call again and amazing it is just heading out the door!  Another 30 minutes still no pizza!    Will never return!  Finally arrives 3 and a half hours into it and it's not even our order!   Take your pizza and shove it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'd had an unrelated issue with HH previously which brought me into this location tonight.  Julia (mgr I originally dealt with) was not in tonight but the M.O.D. Was perfect. We had a bit of confusion at first but quickly figured it out. My pizza's were perfect! Just like I remember back in Michigan. Thanks Garrett and Julia for making me realize why I love your brand...."}
{"text":"Myself and two co-workers ordered lunch delivery, I ordered wings, another ordered wings and steak, cheese & mushroom.  The wings were cooked multiple times, the bones broke apart when bit into them; maybe they were super bowl wings. the calzone sub (steak) above had an end of tomato, brown spots on lettuce and meat was mushy.  The 3rd employee ordered pizza, I guess we should order pizza the next time."}
{"text":"It took the guy three times to get my phone number four times I had to repeat my address an hour later still no show call them they said they had the wrong address gave me a weird address that I never gave them said they had the wrong phone number and yet 20 minutes later showed up at my door which tells me they're lying because how did they get my real address if I didn't give it to them the right way the first time The customer service at this place sucks I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"Yum. Great pizza for a great price. Fast delivery. Love the Cajun crust for a bit of spice."}
{"text":"Gave Hungry Howie's a second try.  I am glad I did.  The pizza was good, all that is wrong with the no flavor carb wraps is right on with the pizza.  I would consider eating here again.

I always recommend using the website since it has coupons and is easy to navigate."}
{"text":"Late review:

Taste wise I'd say it's somewhere between Chuck E Cheese pizza and little Ceasars. 

Less greasy than little Ceasars.
Cheaper than Chuck E Cheese.

Upside is they deliver. 

Downside: My debit card information was stolen with this place being the last place that had seen or charged my card. Card wasn't used days before Howies transactions but once I paid here my account started having random charges within a 24-48 hour. 

Could have just been a coincidence but it's not worth trying it again."}
{"text":"Ordered off of grubhub last night. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with half ranch crust and half butter/cheese crust and the Italian sub. Both were delicious, especially the Italian sub was absolutely fantastic, I will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Solid for the price! Wayyy better than little ceasers or dominos."}
{"text":"I decided to try Hungry Howie's on a whim.  Eek! Me thinks never again!  The pizza was very bland and not something I would recommend to any of my friends.  I would say some of their sandwiches looked pretty good but I haven't tried them."}
{"text":"This is just good pizza! I usually always do pick-up because it's much faster. The employees are friendly and most times joke around with me. Also, I order it extra well done, that way the flavored crust is really crunchy. The chef's salad is great, so is the Italian salad. They are both filled with lots of meat and vegetables. So it's a good even mix, not just lettuce.  
     It's a small place with two tables, the parking is ok. Right now they are still doing construction on Thomas Road, so you have to get around the signs. Overall, it should be fairly easy if you're picking up a hot delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Every time I go in I've always been greeted friendly, their pizzas are great live how I can customize my flavor of the crust, today I went for the lunch special ham/cheese sandwich it was great I even asked if they can add garlic/herb on it which they said \"sure\" it's better than I thought it would be, very hot full of ham/cheese from edge to edge every bite full packed with flavor, next time I'll try another sandwich maybe it'll be the steak/cheese & add another flavored crust to it..."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat \"cheap\" pizza, but every now and then when I do I go with Hungry Howie's and this is the location closest to my house. 

I order online and I've never had a problem. Every time my order is correct and ready on time. 

I like that I customize how much sauce (I like it light) and what kind of crust (sesame) I can get with my pizza. Also, a lot of the deals they offer online are really good."}
{"text":"So, I get the Business Customer Service offer of \"I am so sorry for the confusion and inconvenience this may have caused you. Please provide us with your contact information at hungryhowies.com/about-h... so that we can make this up to you.\" I provide the info and ... nothing!"}
{"text":"Can't leave a review for the food, since I chose to leave without ordering, however I'll leave a review for their customer service, since it was the worst I've ever experienced (and I lived in NYC for 7 yrs, so that's really saying something.) 

On May 27th my children and I stopped by Hungry Howie's in Pineville to place a take-out order.  My daughter & I sat at a table in front of the restaurant where we could see the menu inside.  

As we perused the menu I did not notice that my 6 yr-old autistic son had climbed up onto a low ledge in front of the window of the store next door and had his hands on the glass.

Suddenly a little man in Hungry Howie's employee attire came storming outside.  He yelled \"ARE TOU GOING TO WASH THOSE WINDOWS?!?\" and promptly went back inside.

So we went somewhere else to order dinner."}
{"text":"Cheap eats.  Their distinguishing feature are their flavored crusts, which are crusts that are sprinkled with various spice mixes, or with butter.  Not the best pizza, but you get a lot of pizza for your money."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few weeks ago.  Did not enjoy it at all.  Service was okay, but the pizza is not worth getting.  I know it's cheap, but for me I want quality not quantity.  I'm a regular at Big Jimmy's and I tried this place, just to try it out.  And you know, I think I will stay a regular at Big Jimmy's."}
{"text":"Cold, wet, miserable out so why not pick up a pizza?! A fun pizza! with flavored crust?! Give them a call and it should be ready when you get there...
Open the box and there it is: the pizza of your choosing with a flavorized crust also of your choosing. If you have any complaints at this point you have no one to blame but yourself. Got a bacon cheddar cheese burger with gaelic herb crust:
Pizza was incredibly satisfying, not Chicago-style, not NY-style, just regular pizza style pizza with pizza toppings and fun crust. YEA pizza! Toppings were plentiful and seem of good quality. Cheeses were a gooey and stringy mess dragging the meats all over after being bit and getting ate (pickles would be a nice touch.) Crust was warm and firm with a good bite and chew; very herby, very garlicy, very finger-licky! No soft spot underneath either, all the dough cooked all the way through! YEA baking!

note to self: request square cut next time to make little pizza-sandwiches. and get salad, definitely want at least one salad with this; caesar because it has approximately zero olives."}
{"text":"I am writing this to comment on the delivery driver at this location. A driver  was driving ridiculously erratic 
While I was driving home (I live about 100 yards from this location) a car began riding dangerously close to me, in my review i noticed they had a pizza delivery sign on top for hungry howies. They were obviously on there way back to the store (so not rushing a pizza to someone)  and they began swapping lanes and riding everyones tale (there was plenty of traffic but it was moving at the speed limit). The driver passed me and made some very dangerous lane changes almost hitting (and definitely angering many other drivers).
I did not try to keep up with the driver (because of their dangerous speed and illegal maneuvers), but since it is literally beside my home, I drove by the hungry howies and sure enough that persons car was there. 
It's just ridiculous for someone who is driving for a business and representing that business to drive in that manner. For that reason I will not eat here."}
{"text":"I went into this store awhile ago to order pizza because I had heard from a few people that the pizza was ok. When I walked into the store it was filthy. The glass door and windows were so nasty and greasy looking I was afraid to touch anything. The soda cooler was not filled and had handprints on the front. The staff was rude. I heard a huge amount of profanity coming from the back from what I could hear it sounded like an employee was cussing at customer over the phone. Very unprofessional if I must say. There were people sitting on the counters where they cut the pizza's as well. Stood in there for a few minutes and decided to leave without ordering. I will never be back and I'd advise you not go as well. From the front counter you can tell how dirty the store is. Personally, I like to eat from clean and professional restaurants. This store doesn't even merit one star."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 12:30 am and it never came. I called the store at around 2am and they told me it's on its way but it never showed. I was a huge fan of hungry howies until tonight when they really let me down.  Sorry to say I'll never order from this location again. They have decent customer service, the guy I spoke to on the phone was very polite, but terrible delivery service."}
{"text":"I love the great family specials that they usually have. Today I was surprised that the manager gave me a coupon for Cinco De Mayo and saved me extra $$$ ... the flavored crusts, the quality cheese and the customer service that the manager Amy provided is what keeps me coming back for more. P"}
{"text":"Ordered online and it seemed like a simple process. I got a pizza with the garlic herb crust. It was delicious! I usually don't eat the crust but it's nice that you can pick your flavor of choice. Sauce was good and decent amount of toppings. My only complaint is that I requested bacon on my pizza and didn't get it. I didn't mess it up on my end on my order online because I saw the email confirmation as well as on the sticker on the box that bacon was listed."}
{"text":"Blegh. I was instantly appealed to check this place out when I saw a mailer for inexpensive pizza. We were visiting for two weeks, so plenty of time to try more exciting places, but sometimes you just need a quick and cheap meal to feed the family.

I was under the impression that this place was a ready-for-carryout kinda place with a bunch of pizzas just ready to go at a moment's notice. Nope. We waited about 15 minutes for a totally mediocre and semi-burnt crust pizza to be given over. I paid about $8.50 with tip and would've happily taken a Little Caesar's Pizza (which we like) or a Sam's Club cheapo over this one.

I would not return. Not even if they dropped the prices and offered them ready to go. It's hard to mess up pizza and while nothing was particularly wrong, nothing was particularly right either."}
{"text":"Well, let's begin by saying there at different tiers of . Cheap, drunk, I don't care pizza, on a budget pizza, fresh tasty pizza, and the real thing pizza. Hungry Howie's pizza is the drunk/I don't care pizza, Lol. It's cheap, has good flavor on it and gets the job done. Slightly undercooked, and greasy. The menu has lots of options. The cheese melts nicely btw. 
Yesterday was the first time I had the pizza sober, and eh... It's ok."}
{"text":"Good food. Delivered to my hotel. Got a Caesar salad and wings and got the free small pizza by ordering on my phone. Spicy pizza crust was great. Delivery guy was nice, polite, friendly. Good job guys."}
{"text":"I like the pizza dough and the different flavor crusts. Pizza use to be bigger for the same price. Good but not amazing"}
{"text":"Very poor delivery experience, the driver couldn't find my place so i had to walk to the back of the complex, open the back gate, just to get my food. Pizza was also cold and wasnt the correct order (ordered x3 cajun bread and it wasn't cajun at all).... Bill was 33 dollars and driver didn't have any cash, said some gibberish about his previous deliveries taking all of his cash, i ended up having to give him 40 dollars."}
{"text":"I never would have tried this place if they were not running a great special.
I take my dogs to the groomer at Clip N Tails, and I also get my haircut at Port. I noticed that so many people had pizza boxes from this place, and when I got in my car, I saw their banner ad for $5, one topping, large pizza, and of course I made a mental note. Come the weekend, and I don't want to cook lunch, I called for a takeout order. I was going to order online, but I did not find the special prices online. Their regular priced pizzas are not cheap, but I ordered a large cheese, a large sausage, and a large Hungry Howie Special. The total was just under $25, which would have made the specialty pizza about $15. We also added the crust topping of garlic herb and it was tasty. The pizzas were ready when they said they would be. It wasn't busy at all when we got there, but they had quoted a 20 min pickup time. The toppings all seemed fresh and the crust was not soggy or burned.
I would definitely go there again, but mainly for the $5 large one topping :)"}
{"text":"The family loves the pizza, the last two times my wife bought two large pizzas one salad and a turkey club she was gives two free drinks.  This time when I came in no such luck.  At this point I paid the $38 form my order.  Janan got the hot food (she never showed me the pizza like most do to make sure the order was correct) and had to remind her about the salad.   After she got the salad I asked for packets of Parmesan cheese and she told me they are 10cents a peace. Other places give you cheese packets pepper packets and even paper plates.  If I'm paying $40 I should get at least a dozen or so packets for free.  It would be like ordering tacos from del taco and being told you have to pay for you sauce packets.   At this point I may have to start going else were is there service is going to be so poor.  Janan ruined my experience.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I love the flavored crust from Howie's! My favorite is the Garlic and the Ranch. Their brownies are also AMAZING, they just melt in your mouth. Very good especially for the price."}
{"text":"Cheap but bland pizza. Only worth the $5+ tax if you're absolutely desperate and nothing else is open. 

The 'flavored crust' tastes like any other regular cardboard-type crust.

Sauce is non-existent."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here especially the flavored crust.  Can't beat the price in my opinion.  The thin crust is really good but prefer regular crust with garlic butter flavoring!  Yum."}
{"text":"I just had my first visit to this pizza joint today which is soooo close to my house.  I'd heard great things about Howie's crust so thought why not.  I called and placed an order and was told it would be ready in 20 min.  I arrived in 20 minutes and was greeted promptly by a nice young delivery guy ...who informed me he didn't think it was ready due to a large order that ad just come in to Lowes next door.  He then asked when I was told to be there to which i replied 20 min...20 min ago...sure enough he checks the order and confirms.  So he tells a gal in the back to which she replies \"I don't really care right now I'm to busy with this\"...I think he either knew it wasn't like there was a back office or that her voice did carry because he looked embarrassed for her when he reappeared from behind the half wall.  Glad to hear I didn't matter.   Oh well.  I'm told it may be 20-25 more.  I wait it out.  During the wait I hear the 2 girls working say \"okay we got to start that guys pizza..it's half sausage and half veggie...but WE ARE OUT OF TOMATOES!\"
\"Are you serious\"
\"Yes\"
so...needless to say I got to wondering if my veggie side would get tomato, would they even say anything to me that they were out?  would they just hope i didn't notice and skip the apology?  ended up being the latter. :(
then something great happened....girl one said ...\"we are slammed how come you didn't call someone to come in!\"
\"Because everyone is like 16  and is in school ...It's Monday!\"
\"Yeah....but it's Memorial day...they don't have school.\"
person obviously somewhat in charge of scheduling had no idea it was a national holiday...awesome!
Must say...The crust was no joke very bagel- esque(overall a pretty good pie too), and the young man racing out the door every 5 seconds to deliver pizza was the only one of the 3 with any sense of customer service or common sense....I mean I'm the customer....If your going to talk smack, or say you don't care about my order, or you don't like your coworkers....realize we can hear you from the front....whisper, wait for a break, text each other later at home.  if your going to cut me some toppings....apologize at least, maybe offer me another topping?"}
{"text":"I work next door so usually you would think it's a quick easy lunch for me to grab. I've been in there multiple times now where a staff of 2 sometimes 3 people sees you come in and just looks the other way. Not a single one of them acknowledge your existence in their lobby and treat their guest like they're invisible. It's not a bad company but the staff at this location Higley and Pecos are very unfriendly and I dont have time to stand around being ignored. Even if your busy, give your customers a hello and tell them it will be a minute. No one likes the silent treatment."}
{"text":"I usually order from my grub hub app, and everything is always great! Thank you!"}
{"text":"On a Monday at 1pm.we ordered 3 subs .took 15minites due the fact there was only older lady by her self.
Meat ball sub had alot of cheese and a good bunch of meat. A chicken bacon ranch sub was ok.and so
Called steak sub didn't have much steak. Place was clean and cool in side a plus.but was empty."}
{"text":"I have finally found my go- to pizza in Scottsdale!!  My bf and I have lived here for almost 3 years, and we've always complained about the lack of really good delivery pizza out here.  We've tried everything.  We'd even had HH's before and enjoyed it but weren't particularly blown away.  We are both huge fans of Detroit- style pizza--deep dish, 8 corner, crispy crust, lots of cheese.  Our favorite is Jet's pizza, but, unfortunately, Jet's has not made it out west...enter, HH's deep dish!  We'd had it once before, and there was too much sauce, so it kind of ruined it for us.  Thankfully, we decided to give it another try.  We ordered it with light sauce and the butter crust today, and it was fantastic!!  It's not Jet's, but it's the closest thing we've found out here!  When we want pizza in the future, that's what we'll be getting!  Oh, and delivery has always been fast, and our orders have always been accurate.  That is hard to come by around here."}
{"text":"I ordered from this location and spoke to Drew. He exceeded my expectations as was more than willing to take care of me when I called back to correct my order. This is exactly what shows leadership and success in a company. Thank you Hungry Howies for you exceptional service and great pizza, you will see much more business from us."}
{"text":"This took longer than it should have. It said 30 minutes and is now been more than an hour. This place has ruined my order more than one occasion. If there was a lower rating than one star that's what they would get. Very disappointed in Hungry Howies they need to look into that store"}
{"text":"First off if you have a group of kids to feed great choice! Easy to order and the  taste is good for the price and other comparable pizza places. Third you can't beat the price. We will be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"D- for customer service...man was very short and rude on the phone. Pizza was good though, just a little disappointed with the ordering process."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. The service is not great and they were slow took over an hour, got the order wrong said they would send us another in 40 mins......."}
{"text":"This place is great the only pizza place we ate when i lived in AZ love the garlic crust. I wish they will deliver to CA. The wings are also great"}
{"text":"This place is great the only pizza place we ate when i lived in AZ love the garlic crust. I wish they will deliver to CA"}
{"text":"I hadn't had Hungry Howie's pizza for a good 12 years or so before last night. I prefer pizzeria style pizza to the chain style pizza with all the bread. I used to really like their flavored crusts so I figured why not?

What a waste of $27!!! I got a special with two one-item large pizzas (one with extra cheese) with some cinnamon Howie bread delivered to me.

The cinnamon Howie bread was horrible, the pizzas were meh. The flavored crust wasn't as good as I remembered it either. Last time wasting my money on this crappy pizza!

If you're going to make pizza that is just like Little Caesar's, then charge $5.00 like Little Caesar's does!!!"}
{"text":"Not Donatos (definitely 5 star chain pizza), but not Papa John's either (generous 2 star chain pizza). Hungry Howie's has satisfied a hungry Andrea a time or two. 
Sometimes I'm just lazy and want food, what can I say. HH is literally about 50 yards from my house so that definitely helps me steer toward this place, but it's actually decent pizza.

Great deals - usually can get a large 2 topping for 10 bucks (take that Pizza Hut) - and you choose from one of about 6 or so 'flavored crusts'. This is their signature thing at HH. Pretty much just some seasoning cooked onto the crust, but it is very good. We've had the Cajun and Garlic so far. Both pretty good but I'd have to say the garlic was better. 

The restaurant itself is nothing special but does have a reasonably sized seating area with both booths and tables. There's also a separate waiting area with benches if you're picking up and a Lakewood Observer for you to flip through while you wait. 

Overall it's cheap chain pizza that's fast and actually pretty tasty. Definitely not as greasy as the mainstream PJ or Domino's. Worth a try if you're in the mood for some cheap eats."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good for price if you call for pickup its always ready early go there lot of times never had a problem"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from a theater production to get pizza. The employee who took our order was polite. The food was diligently prepared and upon arriving home, still hot and pretty good. If what you're looking for is a quick pizza, this is perfect. If you're looking for a fine Italian pizza, seek elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. However, the service is not. Called for delivery. When we were on hold for 15 minutes, we tried calling on a second cell phone. They immediately picked up and asked if we could hold. I said no, but they had already put me on hold. We finally hung up both cell phones when the wait time hit 25 minutes.

UPDATE: This hasn't happened since, and service has improved drastically. Kudos to the owner and management team. Pizza continues to please!"}
{"text":"You ever get customer service so bad that it just kinda ruins your day? That was this place. Messed up my order too, almost had 2 stars because what i got was more expensive than what I ordered, but it was so bad I couldn't even give that."}
{"text":"They were doing flavored crust before it was cool, and it's amazing.. Yeah, it's a chain pizzeria, but it's a lesser-known variety, so I've gotta tell the world! It's a lot better, IMO, than the big 3 delivery parlors. $10 gets you a generous large pie for those days you're just feeling real lazy. :-p"}
{"text":"Drunk? 
Need pizza?
Don't mind if you poop your brains out in the morning? 
Then get Howie's. It always tastes so good going in that it's kind of worth it. I think?"}
{"text":"Holy grease balls! Yes I know Howies isn't the\"best\" pizza around but I wish their locations would be consistent! When I lived in south Scottsdale it always came fresh! I went to this location and picked up(should be fresher) and it was a pile of grease with a pizza in it. Please make this location better!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. Love the garlic herb crust! I ordered a pizza to be picked up, and for fun, I asked them to draw a heart inside the box... Just to see what would happen... And they totally did it! It added a personal touch to my order. Thanks, Hungry Howie's!"}
{"text":"So last time we ordered from here we ordered stuff crust and when we got home it wasn't right.  I'm not one for complaining or wasting my time to go back.  When my wife went tonight she mentioned that last time we didn't get the stuffed crust.  The manager went above and beyond this time to make it right.  Customer service is awesome and when someone goes out of the way to make their mistake right they have a forever customer in me."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Crust was decent. Service a bit slow which is odd bc doesn't seem like a lot of people good there.  I may go back once they give better offers to bring customers back.  I'm all for keeping our local business going but if they don't make more of effort to keep you wanting to come back.. may lose more business"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizzas, got two pizzas and one empty box. Didn't make for a very good birthday party. HH then refused to throw in anything extra to make up for a dozen hungry people sitting around waiting. They sent out a new pizza but I've had time to write this review and it still hasn't shown up. Customer service could have gone a long way in this case."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?? Not only was Ryo the kindest pizza delivery clerk to whom I've ever spoken, but she also helped to solve a major problem. We called in & said \" Ryo, we got $16 and we've been out at Talking Stick Resort all day, raging. We need a pizza priced low enough for us to still be able to pay for delivery.\" She promptly informed us of their pizza special of the night, a Large 14-inch 2-topping pizza. Needless to say, we got that pizza with $3.57 to spare. I'd say this is a perfect example of 5-star customer service & dining experience. I highly recommend Hungry Howies to anyone ballin' on a budget. -Thanks Ryo!"}
{"text":"this is the worst pizza I have had delivered...  in Surprise AZ
NO thank you

the pizza did not look like any of the pictures on this webpage"}
{"text":"Normally I don't have a problem with this location their delivery is normally on time and they don't screw up my orders. Except when I order their calzones and they normally forget the sub sauce that's supposed to come with it. I normally get the steak and mushroom w/ swiss added with jalapenos. Tonight I ordered the same w/ a chicken ceasar salad. The salad was OK but wouldn't really recommend for anybody. But on top of forgetting my sub sauce AGAIN. This is 5 out of 7 deliveries by the way with the calzone. They forgot the 2 things I added to it and no garlic butter on it like normal so it was very dry and for some reason pizza sauce was added to it which doesn't really go well with the calzone I ordered. This may well have been my last order from this location.


Just something to add my rating has nothing to do with their delivery service. That has always been good for the most part."}
{"text":"Have you ever had the communal bread during service?

Yea that's what Friday night deliveries of Hungry Howie's pizza crusts taste like. 
Dry, crumby, doughy.

It was a pleasant reminder of the desert sand Phoenix was built on but sadly not one that reflects good pizza taste.

Don't forgot the dried on cheese glue on top!

Yum!

You couldn't pay me 5 dollars to eat this but sadly my inebriated comrades seem to love its pink pizza cases and their friendly 45 min service!

On a plus side this pizza does have the magical effect of bringing you down to wherever depths of euphoria you were in to the stark reality with just 1 slice

 :O

One last crack....

This is one pizza Digiornio's can beat in their \"fake pizza delivery ads\" blegh"}
{"text":"The pizza is terrific, but I will not go to this Hungry Howie's again due to poor customer service.  I have ordered pizza for my family and my classroom over 10 times at this location and I have had negative customer experience 9 times.  Shame on me!  I would advise others to go to the other pizza joints in the area."}
{"text":"Placed on order online because I had a coupon for a free medium 1 topping pizza with any $12 online order - excellent deal.

Walked into the store to the overwhelming aroma of raw sewage and a lovely pulsing beeping. We had to wait a few moments for help. The first employee was a bit curt, informing us the other employee would need to ring us up. He comes out, gets my info, has me sign, and makes a joke about how he thought my pizza wasn't ready but remembered that I placed it \"a long time ago.\" 

I placed it 30 minutes ago. The website said it would take 30 minutes. 

We raced out of the store to escape the assault on our olfactory and auditory senses. Get home, open the pizzas, and find one pizza was double cut into miniature slices and the other wasn't cut at all. The one that wasn't cut was also missing the ranch crust that was ordered. Oh, and if you couldn't guess, it was also cold.

I will thoroughly avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"So the owner of this restaurant called me back and apologized. He was completely horrified. The way this owner handled the situation was great. I will definitely give them a second chance."}
{"text":"We loved HH's in Anthem years ago so we were excited to have it again when we came back to AZ. No, never, not again. I don't know if the recipe changed or is different per location, but this is not anything anyone would ever crave, want, look forward to eating. This is a notch above Little Caesar's. Overpriced considering the taste."}
{"text":"U can always do half pizza with one topping & another half with different topping for no extra price! oh and its just $5. pay a $ more and get 2 of the best tasting garlic butter suaces to put on them :)"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME...pizza hot and tastes great!!! Staff friendly and did i say pizza was INCREDIBLE!!! GO..!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is alright I personally think little Caesars pizza is better. They were friendly just a lot of messing around in the back and never wore gloves, it grossed me out a lot ."}
{"text":"Hello Friends

I haven't been to HH in over 10 years. (just reason being is that I moved) I ride by this location often and finally took the time to try them out again. 

Ordered delivery. I'm about 5-8 miles away. Ordered 1 Large 2 topping (sausage & pepperoni) w/  Garlic Butter crust. 2 small subs. (Italian sub & Turkey Club)

The delivery only took Mayyyybe 20mins. The subs crust was crazy good. Both subs exceeded our expectations. And the pizza itself was Still very HOT. 

Try em out. Glad I did. It was just the way I remembered it!! GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Get the BBQ chicken Pizza! Only thing I ever really ordered when I wanted delivery pizza.
Delivery time is pretty good, I can't complain too much. 
Never really had an issue with the food being delivered. One issue was with them sending the wrong pizza to me. Once that was addressed, they sent over a new one. 
Really nice staff too when I went in the shop. Overall, I would recommend if you've never been. Give it a shot"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium pizza and Howie bread both of which were under cooked. I also ordered 1 pizza sauce and 3 garlic sauces. I got 4 pizza sauces..... I will give them credit as they came back out and delivered the garlic sauce after I called obviously greatly appreciated"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Hungry Howie's twice. The first time the pizza was okay but the wait time was twice what we were told (an hour 15 minutes on a weekday at lunchtime). My kids enjoyed the flavored crust so we tried again when they had several friends over. The pizza took just under two hours to be delivered despite a call to the manager who assured me the driver was only 5-10 minutes away- it then took an additional 30 minutes. The pizza was cold and despite being starving, my kids and their guests barely touched it. Mediocre pizza franchises are prevalent in our area so next time we will order somewhere else."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Hungry Howies...it's cheap.  The pizza isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  It falls into that weird in-between zone where you still order it, but at the same time you know there are many better places to get some pie. 

In college, my best friend/roommate and I probably had Howie's on speed dial.  And somehow, every now and then, we used to be able to talk them into delivering us a free pizza.  I still don't know how we did it.  

But when we did have to pay, it would never cost much.  They always had these great combos for around $10 that came with a large pizza, Howie bread and a liter of soda, not too shabby.

If I had a Hungry Howies close to me, I'd probably still order from them when I want decent pizza at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Ok. This is ridiculous. Why did I order 3 pizzas for the people that are helping me move today and I order 8 wings and a chicken ceaser salad and before I opened the container I notice something moving around inside. It was a live fly. I called the store approximately 3 mins after the young lady deliver the food and asked to speak to the manager. The manager got on the phone and had attitude. I told him about the fly and that the driver had just left. He told me that he would give a discount on my next order. I told him no thank you I want my money back and he can take all the food back. He then offers this same discount on my next order. I told him again that I wanted my money back he told me he will give me the money for the salad only. I repeated myself again asking for my money and he told me that he can not send the driver back to give me my money because he has other deliveries. I became upset and told him that he is going to give me my money or I will be calling the general manager. He then told me that he would send the driver back with my money. The female driver showed up and she was extremely nice. That's the only reason they deserve a 1. I know it wasn't the drivers fault."}
{"text":"I placed and order for 3 pizzas and they said it would be about 45 mins. 1.5hrs later and after having to call twice the food finally shows up. One pizza is burnt and of course all 3 were no longer hot. For $50...not worth it. Overpriced, bad service and poor delivery."}
{"text":"We haven't order from here in a while since the last time the pizza was smooshed. We did again today. The order was wrong so we called. We were informed they would make another but would need the incorrect pizza back... for $27.00 we received the two smallest pizzas. Clearly the location isn't concern with quality of product or service. Once again we'll go with Pizza Hut and receive what we ask for and gain points towards a quality free pizza...go else where would be my advice."}
{"text":"Easy, fast and enjoyable.  We had no expectations and were very pleased with the overall experience.  Will order again!"}
{"text":"Super good this time! Much better! Friendly staff. I wish they would think about bringing one to casa grande, az though. :-)"}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's is Detroit-based. I just moved from Detroit so I have had Hungry Howie's over 100 times in my life. I won't be returning to the Camfield location again, though.

Ordered online. It stated order would be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up over 20 minutes later. Noticed there was  an order that looked like my in the warmer. 

I paid for the order. Phillip told me 15 minutes (as he had his back turned and walked away). Guess that order in the warmer wasn't mine. Seemed odd that I had to wait 15 more minutes with 5 employees and a store that seemed super slow. I assumed they didn't start on my order as 15 minutes would have been long enough to make a pizza, roll, cheese sticks and a brownie. 

So I sat. Two people came in and got their pizzas in those 15 minutes (to show how slow the store was). And then Danielle came up 15 minutes later and asked what my order was. After I told her, she looked in the warmer. Yep, that order was indeed mine. Phillip didn't even look.  And when Danielle went to get an answer as to why, he seemed be no longer in the restaurant. 

I gave Danielle and the store a chance to make this good. Maybe throw a coupon at me. $5 off my next purchase? 50% off a large pizza? Nothing. She even said, \"There isn't really anything we can do.\"

Well, I can: Never come back. And tell as many people to never come here.

I got to my car and noticed one thing was missing from my order. I walked in, was given the missing item, and gave the store another chance to make it right. Nope. Again, nothing was offered. I might have gotten a simple \"sorry\" that time."}
{"text":"This Hungry Howie's is pretty good. I've ordered from them several times and they make their Pizza consistent and I have no complaints. The customer service is great as well. I would recommend and I frequent Hungry Howie's with my family."}
{"text":"Went to this location and told them about the Yelp advertisement for One large with 5 toppings for $10.99. They stated that it must be an expired coupon and that they aren't even on Yelp. I explained that you are on Yelp and someone needs to either pull the advertisement or honor it. They refused to honor the Yelp coupon. 

Not sure that I would come back after that. They are in now way trying to accommodate the customer."}
{"text":"Yes, I am giving Hungry Howies 5-stars. Why? Because when I lived in Kent, I lived next door to one and it never let me down. Now that I again live near by, they continue to never let me down. I always order the garlic & herb crust with whatever toppings I want at the time. There customer service is awesome too! Oh and if I only had the crust with some of their garlic sauce, I'd be good to go. Seriously, for all you garlic lovers out there, make sure to order the garlic & herb crust. You will not be sorry. Hungry Howies is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Very good price for what you're getting... I got a calzone and it was super filling. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The employees here are awful. Several times I have ordered a pizza over the phone and gone to pick it up and they said they never received my order. This has happened three times!!!! Then I had to sit and wait while they cooked it and listen to the employees make themselves pizzas to take to a party when they got off. I received no apology or discount for their mistake. Ridiculous. This place is dirty and the floors need a good mop. Deep clean this place!"}
{"text":"This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it weren't for the flavored crust I would not come back. 
But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howie's is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment. 
You'd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed."}
{"text":"Well Hungry Howie's is by far my favorite pizza delivery place it's great pizza at cheap price"}
{"text":"This is a carry-out only spot.  It is easy to find in a strip mall with a good amount of parking.  I always place my order online and by the time I drive there (10-15 in) it is ready.  It always tastes fresh.  The crust flavor option is my favorite part about their pizza, and you can split it up half and half: win!!  I like all that I have tried, including butter, garlic, asiago cheese, and Cajun.  I wish the crust would be a little softer, maybe more chewy as opposed to rough??  I don't know if that's exactly the word to describe it, but its the best I can do.  

The people are not overly friendly.  They are just there, give the pizza, take the money, done.  But, I have never had bad service."}
{"text":"30 minutes late,,, pizza was cold and stale,,, no discount,,, just horrible,,, lesson learned,,"}
{"text":"Finally tried my local hungry howies expecting the same service that my friends receive at other locations.  It was an extended ordering process with someone that did not know their menu, and asked me to repeat everything I said.  I was told it would be a 45 minute delivery. Delivery took 2 hours.   The food was great, delivery sucked and eventually the manager called and offered the entire thing for free."}
{"text":"This pizza company is great, I have not had this pizza since HS. The flavored crust sets them apart. The sign is easy to see and was busy when I went tonight. 
We got the flavored crust, butter cheese with pepperoni and Howie Bread. 
I think I got food poisoning, sick from 11pm-2am. Not fun. Not going to eat here ever again."}
{"text":"I ordered here once before and it was decent the first time.

I placed an order last night around 10:30 pm and they said around 30-40 minutes for delivery. I accepted.

As 11:30 comes around I decide to call in to see where the guy is at. The college kid working there had no clue what was going on. He asked me a few questions and told me to hold. About 30 seconds later some tool got on the phone and said \"What can I do for you?\"... and then asked me if I was calling the right number.  After that he told me the only order placed from this number was over two months ago.

Just a bunch of donkeys working here."}
{"text":"I've ordered here twice using the Yelp app. The food is fine. Nothing great-- it's pretty typical for delivery pizza and wings. The first time, they didn't follow my delivery instructions. I asked them to deliver to my business  back door but instead the guy comes in the front and hands me my pizza while I'm trying to close a deal with a customer. I had a reason for asking for a back door delivery... Why ask if we have delivery preferences if you aren't going to follow those instructions?  The second time I ordered from them because I was crazy hungry and they were estimating only a 30-40 minute wait...  It took well over an hour and a half to deliver a small pizza and 8 wings. Why specify 30-40  minutes if you mean 90?  I don't even wait 90 minutes for Spinattos and that's the best pizza in the whole world!  So that was a long way of saying: not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"First and last time.  Not overly picky when I am ordering pizza for delivery but this pizza has no flavor.  Just moved to Chandler...never heard of the place...didn't look at yelp.  I would choose Domino's over this and I am not a fan of Domino's.  The delivery was slow but it was also the NCAA championship night so was fine with that.  The delivery person came back about 20 min later as he said he forgot to give us our 2 liter bottle of soda and bread...I had not ordered them.  He said they came free with every order so if that if the case, I applaud them for that!"}
{"text":"2nd time ordering from this location. One of the best pizza places in town. Placed my order via an android app. Was given a call within 3 mins of placing order to confirm I placed my order correct. 1st I ordered I was given an hour delivery time frame due to the busy day of week. My order was delivered within 30 mins. Cutting their estimated time in half. 2nd time I had a pickup order and was given a 25 min estimation yet my order was done within 15 mins and was hot and ready when I arrived. 

Their prices can be a little pricey for specialty made pizzas but well worth the price."}
{"text":"Some of the absolute worst food I have ever put in my mouth. We got wings and a chicken bacon ranch sub. The sub was basically a folded calzone and was complete grease, the bacon tasted like it was made in a microwave and the chicken was chewy and gross. The wings tasted like they were frozen and heated up in a microwave as well. I could have made better wings at home with 2 percent effort. We will never eat here again, waste of $45"}
{"text":"It pains me to say this but this Hungry Howies is just awful! Their customer service is some of the worst I have seen. Recently my boyfriend ordered a pizza and after an hour of waiting for it he called to see what was up and the person who answered the phone said...\"uhh, we tried to contact you about that, we can't deliver there.\" They didn't try to contact him and he had ordered delivery in that range before fine. Their pizza is alright and cheap but we won't be ordering it when we're in town again due to the bad service."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and awesome people! Had no idea this place existed until a few weeks ago and now I'm so grateful I do! Garlic herb and asiago for the win!"}
{"text":"When this Hungry Howie's opened it was terrible. I spent $80 ordering food for a large group and requested extra butter cheese crust on all of the pizzas and extra seasoning on all of the Howie breads. Rather than extra seasonings they put virtually none. Several orders following this were equally terrible. 
I didn't order from them for over a year. But on a whim ordered a pizza and bread recently. Again I ordered extra seasonings and the pizza and bread was done correctly. The food was delicious! If this keeps up I'll be ordering regularly. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Its ok pizza, just have to say that picking up sucks. The staff rudely take the parking in front of the store and stand in the parking spots while smoking their ciggies. Inside, some bearded guy decides to howl as loud as he can. Unprofessional. This is a place of business, not a romper room! Clean it up please."}
{"text":"Usually this is our late night craving & know that we would get our order delivered before closing... Well the one time I decided to do a yelp/online order.. It wasn't delivered within \"45min\" window... I placed an order by 9:13pm and they close at 10:00pm...im like at least 10 min from the place (& yeah maybe I should of just picked it up myself... But couldn't BC we have a little one sick at home) I called almost at 11pm, I didn't think they would answer, but I was told that my pizza was still at their location BC they know had one driver, and they didn't want my pizza to get cold... I get it and I appreciate the generous thought of keeping my food warm... But I thought to myself \"isn't that the reason why they have the pizza bags?\" they are great and all, & like I said they are the only late night craving... Since they are opened past 9pm..."}
{"text":"Was excited to order Hungry Howie's pizza last night... a meat lovers... thin crust $17.00+.  The most disappointing pizza ever.... it was over cooked and horrible."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and not too pricey.  The aziago flavored crust is the best in my opinion, I found the ranch and the garlic flavored crusts to be too salty for my preference."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Waited 45 for my 3 large pizza to be delivered. Then the driver pulls up he informed me his name was Jeff and he was high as can be he couldn't even focus his eyes he reeked of  he was completely unprofessional and immature I will never order from this location as long as that drug addict works there"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. I have had delivery from this location in the past, and now suddenly they won't deliver. Very upsetting considering that they have never had issues delivering to is before. Ended up getting dominoes with No problems at all. Supervisor wouldn't let me speak with anger to voice my concern."}
{"text":"I ordered the Philly steak and cheese pizza and plain wings; it took over an hour for us to get our food. By the time it arrived, the pizza was cold. Let me tell you, a philly steak pizza REALLY loses its taste once it gets cold. The wings were hot, however they were buffalo style rather than plain. My wife cannot handle spicy foods so she would not touch them. I feel like i not only wasted my time but also my money. They'll never see another cent from me again."}
{"text":"Attempted to order a stuffed crust to my job. After waiting almost 45 mins and the driver called to also confirm, they had the nerve to call me back and say I had to sign the receipt at the store. The guy said it was store policy. Um no, jerk. Your driver forgot the receipt and you have the nerve to tell me I have to go down there instead owning up to your drivers mistake. You thought! I just ordered from somewhere else."}
{"text":"We keep coming back here. It's good pizza at a reasonable price. We love the ranch flavored crust. But other than their pizza, I can't recommend anything else on their menu."}
{"text":"The experience I had here was pretty bad, when I called to order my pizza they immediately put me on hold for 10 minutes then when I ordered my pizza they said it was a 45 minute wait, it took an hour and 25 minutes after an hour I called and asked if my pizza was on its way and they put me on hold again and after 5 minutes of being on hold they hung up on me and when I got the pizza it was cold I had to warm it up in the microwave just for it to taste decent then on top of that the delivery guy asked if he could use my cell phone to call someone and I apologized and said that it was dead and on the charger and he proceeded to bug me about using my cellphone until I finally said have a goodnight and closed the door and by the time I got my cold pizza no part of me wanted to eat it and if they would have been honest about the wait time up front I would have gone somewhere else"}
{"text":"Placed an order with this location on the phone. They inform me that they lock their door after 9 pm so I should call them when I'm outside to pick it up. I immediately thought \"hmm that's weird\". Even weirder when I get there and the door is locked AND the lights are off. I attempt to call the store and the automated voice message says their closed. But it was 1130 pm and they closed at 12 on Fridays and saturdays. My boyfriend goes outside and knocks on the door and waves his hand at a guy for about 2 minutes. The guy won't come to the door. Eventually my boyfriend attempts to sign with this hands that we had called and placed and order. And then he eventually lets us in and we pay. Then we have to be \"let out\" after cause they locked the door behind us. Then turned the lights off again!! Do they just not want business? The one cashier said there is problems with the phones and that's why it said they were closed. Sounds like bullshit to me"}
{"text":"So, I've changed my tune a bit on HH. It's not frozen dough (I've seen them making the dough fresh) and it's not bad tasting at all. Try the garlic seasoned crust and with one of their frequent coupon mailers, it's hard to find better quality for the price. The staff are super-consistent and pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and great food everytime. I prefer them over other pizza places. The Howie bread is great especially the cinnamon bread with icing."}
{"text":"I used to get the regular pizza and it's ok. Just recently tried the deep dish and it is by far better than the regular crust. I'd even say for a chain pizza maybe the best I've tasted. Never had an issue with any of the employees or ordering..."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail today, which prompted me to order some Hungry Howie's Pizza. I didn't feel like cooking today for some reason.  

I ordered a medium cheese, medium veggie, chicken Caesar salad, and brownie dessert.  Because I ordered online, I was able to use multiple coupons, which was cool. Less than an hour later, the delivery dude was at the door. 

The pizza was hot, so that was a good start.  The pizza looked appetizing and smelled good too.  But when I ate the pizza, it was uninspired and average.  The garlic crust had a little flavor, but nothing to write home about.  They do offer other crust seasonings. I was hoping for new and inspired pizza in my neighborhood, but alas, I'll keep looking.

The brownie tasted like a boxed brownie I could get at Walmart.  The pizza was very much like Little Caesar's, aka, cardboard.  The salad was also uninspired and bland. It contained only iceberg lettuce, cheese, and some lightly seasoned chicken.  Veggie toppings on the pizza tasted fresh, but that was about the only good thing I experienced.  Nothing special here.  Move along."}
{"text":"I would give ZERO stars if it was possible. We loved your pizzas until last night. It came early and we were surprised until we opened the boxes! We ordered a cheese and a Vegetarian pizza. It was slashed up into odd shapes with the pizza knife. DID YOU HIRE A SERIAL KILLER TO SLICE THEM?? The pizzas didn't survive the slaughter and then they were also burned with DARK brown cheese. If that wasn't the worst, the VEGETARIAN pizza had HAM sprinkled in it!!! When I called to speak to the manager the next morning they offered me nothing. No apology or offer to make it right. I still had the pizzas so I could show the slices. I wanted just a $10.00 credit for a $32.00 order. Denied even an apology. We're telling every media outlet accessible to us!!! Shame on you Howie..shame on you!!!"}
{"text":"There was nothing that differentiated this pizza from any of the big chains. We don't like the big chains, and had heard that this was really good, but apparently not. Also tried the gluten free on one of pies, it was hard to chew and burnt. We'll look elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I'm willing to try lots of companies, but I always come back to Hungry Howies. They have an awesome deep dish pizza that is waaaay better than Pizza Hut. Not super greasy, not super dense that you feel icky after eating it. The mushrooms are fresh and not canned and you can also choose flavored crusts. I'm not a fan of ranch, but my boyfriend loves it."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's....good, cheap pizza.  Yeah it's not fancy wood baked pizza, but for the price, you can't beat it.  Always good coupon deals around too.  I'd rank Hungry Howie's above Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's..any of the big chain, econo-pizza joints.

From this location, I've always had really good service."}
{"text":"Was told they stop taking delivery orders at 7:49 pm when they close at 8? Was i not still within business hours?  I know its christmas eve but why be open if you're just gonna turn people away?"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price! We order from this place even though it's on the other side of Matthews from where we live. Sure beats Domino's or Papa John's."}
{"text":"Tried another pizza place but their delivery driver was out for the night before I called Hungry Howies. I listened to the specials on the phone, and misheard the price. When the guy on the phone told me the price I asked him if I could call right back because we needed to check out the menu one more time. He said it was fine. I called back about 4 minutes later and I think another guy answered the phone. I told him I previously called and he said me order was put in. Umm no, because I didn't order it. So I told him I wanted to order something else, a special for $12.99, I believe that included a deep dish pizza and howie bread. He told me for like $4 more I could get 2 medium pizzas and howie bread. So I said ok, do that. Then I added on an order of wings for around $15. He told me my total was close to $50. Umm what??? I was so annoyed and hungry at this point that I gave him my card number anyways. He asked me for it 3 times and still couldn't get it right! I had him read it back to me and realized he completely missed 4 digits that I gave him. I canceled the order. It scares me to think someone making pizza can't even do simple math or take down a credit card number efficiently. We got pizza hut instead. Will not do business here ever again.

*Don't even bother with their online ordering, I tried to use it before I had to call in and the website was confusing and wasn't working properly."}
{"text":"I normally don't give a bad rating to a business, but I just received my print out from my bank that shows Hungry Howies on Lemon Street charged my credit card 3 times @ $18.33. I will be going in to see the Manager to see if he or she will remedy the transactions. If they take care of the 2 extra charges,  I will reflect it on my review."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's has like the best garlic crust pizza. Large pizza with garlic crust is only $5 you can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Always friendly service, have never received unfriendly service. Have messed up our orders 3 times in 6 years. BUT they are always quick to fix them when they do, and with a smile. This place is quick, and good food. Their antipasto salads are to die for!  They are an A rated restaurant  for a reason too. Thanks guys for a great 6 years, and here's to many more!"}
{"text":"My favorite chain pizza ever! I love and crave this pizza all the time. There must be something truly addictive in the flavored crust. It's always perfectly cooked and the service is friendly. Plus, it reminds me of OU, so how can you go wrong?

I recommend the Cajun crust if you like a little kick. I pretty much stick with that and the garlic herb with pepperoni pizza. Delicious."}
{"text":"Cant stop by The Phoenix área without picking one of these bad boys up. Not sure if it's because I'm from out of town and don't usually have this but I love it. Please open a spot in South Orange county!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but the crust is pretty bad unless you get Cajun.
They used to add a lot of seasoning to the crust, and it was very flavorful. 

One of the employee's explained to me that they now are forced to use less flavor on the crust though, which is a huge downer for me.

When I pay extra for extra flavoring on my crust however, it comes with the same amount, and I'm paying extra for no reason.  

Additionally the last 2 times I've been there, they got my order wrong.

Update:
I was contacted and given a coupon to try this place again.  After using this coupon and trying it again, this place has gotten a lot better.  Or atleast my pizza that day was really good, anyways.  Perfect amount of seasoning on the crust.  The pizza's have never been fantastic, but they've been good, the crust is what really makes these pizzas good.
The service could be better, however as I waited awhile and they \"forgot\" they finished my pizza a little while ago.  But I understand that they're often times busy, so I can't fault them too much on that."}
{"text":"If we could give zero stars we would. Waited 2 hours only to find out they lost our order."}
{"text":"Great pizza with flavored crust open late in Tempe until 3am also. They run $5 pizza specials also but Check locations Ahwatukee didn't but Tempe does."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience, but here are the good and bad points: A friendly driver opened the door for me. The front counter person was welcoming and responsive. The customer area was clean, and there was one table. That's the good.

The bad was that the item I ordered was truly disgusting (chicken bacon ranch sub). It was an oily, goopy, salty mess of overcooked bread and thin, runny filling. I gave back half of it.

The restaurant has no free water or drinking fountain, so bring your own or you'll have to buy water.

And I felt pressured to give a tip after paying with a card for over-the-counter food (but before getting the awful thing), because after I signed the form, it was given back to me to \"fill in the total.\" That felt like a cheap trick to me, but at least they did bring the food out."}
{"text":"Great tasting cheap pizza. Love the flavored crust. Take out only, no dine in. Pepsi products on hand."}
{"text":"Every time I order pizza from here it is so good. Although it's only been 3-4 times I've ordered from here each time has been amazing with no mistakes at all. The employees are always friendly and the food is always great. Definitely recommend if you're looking for cheap but delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"So I have been ordering delivery from this Hungry Howies location for over a year now and just today I went to order a pizza and the man I was on the phone with told me my address is out of the delivery zone it wouldn't let him put the order threw. I'm in the system and everything. Very bizarre and absolutely ridiculous figuring I'm only 3 miles from this store!!! I don't understand as to why it wouldn't let them deliver to me all of a sudden. I know it was out of the managers hand that I was talking too but corporate needs to fix this glitch because they have lost one dedicated customer!!!"}
{"text":"Being an Italian from the East Coast I am disappointed on a regular basis when it comes to the pizza choices here.  I have found a few acceptable places with some decent pizza, however this is definitely not one of them.  I've had frozen pizza better than this.  took well over an hour for delivery, showed up barely warm, undercooked, and should have came with a missing toppings sign because they were no where to be found."}
{"text":"Good not great pizza. This is a chain store there big thing is flavored crusts which is pretty good. I go with butter!

Allergy alert: Their sauce does not have garlic in it so if you know of someone who has a garlic allergy they can eat this pizza sauce without worry of garlic (make sure to check again before trying it, just to make sure)."}
{"text":"Very small space. Not really meant to be a sit down and eat place. We've had pizza and the oven baked subs, both are very delicious. Friendly staff. They could clean up the tables a bit better. We come here every time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pretty OK pizza for a pretty OK price. To me the pizza is just a slight step above Little Caesars. I'd suggest giving it a shot if you feel like something cheap and easy."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good and delivery was quicker than expected. The cheese is amazing. They're my go too ."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Howie's. Pretty decent pizza. Had The Works with the butter cheese crust. Couldn't tell much difference on the crust but the toppings were plentiful. Delivery was on time and no problems there. I'll order again."}
{"text":"We ordered the Turkey Deluxe calzone & the steak & mushroom calzone both of which were good but the turkey was best. The steak one was a little greasy & had a sub seasoning packet but was missing the mayo packet that we paid extra for. The caramel topped brownies were a little disappointing- they were cold but we had expected they would be warm but in all fairness we hadn't asked about that. They didn't have a strong chocolate taste either. The staff was very friendly & helpful!"}
{"text":"Hungry howies makes consistently good pizza and we have eaten here many times because of the good quality pizza hungry howies makes.The pizza here is very inexpensive.We got a large pizza for just 9.75 with 2 toppings included. Whereas in other pizza places you get only a small for 13.00!I recommend this place for all pizza lovers. and even if you don't like pizza Hungry Howies is the best place to start liking pizza. Plus the pizza took very little time."}
{"text":"On time delivery and you know what to expect. Great pizza when you are hungry and need to feed an entire office"}
{"text":"When I eat this pizza, I am reminded of what it means to love. Ranch crust is the best crust."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's is by no means artisanal pizza, but it's a good Pizza Hut/Dominos alternative. Their flavored crusts are unique for franchised pizza. This location has been open only a short time and it's a nice option to have in the neighborhood.

I've had Hungry Howie's pizza in the past and was never that impressed. This carry out order included a thin garlic and herb crust pizza. Stumbled upon something I really liked. I'll admit to being shocked how much I enjoyed it. The original round asiago crust was fine as well, but more at the level I expected.

Much of Howie's business is delivery, but if you do decide to carry out, be forewarned this location is hidden back in the corner of the strip center (SE corner of the intersection, next to Safeway). No space to dine in.

Hungry Howie's is very promotional. Grand opening coupons. Online deals. You should never have to pay full price. This day we received a free large pizza as part of their grand opening. We'll definitely consider Howie's again if we have a large group and need some decent cheap pizza."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's, unlike some pizza places around ASU, is willing to deliver on campus. I'm sure it's a frustration for them, but their delivery guys always seem friendly. They also deliver by appointment. On this day they were ten minutes early.

Decent pizza, but far from great. Price (and perhaps flavored crust) has always been their selling point. I \"liked\" their pizza a lot better when they were selling one topping pizzas for five bucks, but they've done away with that promotion. $6.50 is now the going price, a 30% increase. Still cheap, but I opt for Hungry Howie's when I'm ordering eight or ten pizzas or more, so it definitely adds up for me. They also charge $3.50 for delivery. And a tip for the driver of course.

I like their delivery service and tolerate their pizza. They've always been my go-to source when a timely delivery and mass quantities were needed. I have had some minor confusion with orders in the past, a complaint shared by some other reviewers, so I've taken to physically walking into the store to preorder when I'm having a large quantity of pizza delivered. I'll definitely use them again, but given their current pricing I'm planning to be more aware of competitor's promotions going forward."}
{"text":"I am so horribly disappointed in Hungry Howies, and after today's services I will not be ordering from Hungry Howies and I will NEVER recommend this place unless you pick up the pizza your self. 
Let me elaborate. I am a full time college student as well as work full time. I ordered a pizza for (breakfast/lunch) because I needed to work on my homework before I went to work for the night. 
I placed my order in online for delivery to same time. The wait time was expected to be 40 minutes. After waiting for an hour I called to see if the delivery person was lost, since I do live in an apartment complex. 
They informed me that no order for delivery was sent in... They did not offer to make my pizza and only after I was told it was my fault because I did not call in my order i received a very \"whatever\" apology. 
If I paid online with a credit card instead of using the cash option I would have lost money. So I had no time to get food from any place else, so I will go to work with out food until midnight or later. 
I do understand it was a technical problem and that it was not the managers fault, I do not blame him for any technical problems. However I am very upset in his \"its unfortunate\" demeanor and I am still shocked looking back that he didn't even try to make it right by sending out the new order.
I feel defeated and extremely disappointed in the company that I always stood up for against others who said this company is \"crap\", because now I have nothing to defend.
And I am STILL hungry!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I came into Hungry Howies with two coupns for a free small cheese pizza. Even though there was a bit of confusion on how to apply the coupons, the employees were very nice and even gave me some free breadsticks for the wait.
I loved the pizza, and the flavored crusts! The cajun flavor was the best (I got garlic and cajun crusts) and the breadsticks were good as well. I want to try all the crusts now :) Overalll their service and food were great!"}
{"text":"While my general tendency is to stay away from chains, sometimes other factors (time, convenience, cost, etc.) will sway me from my path.  

Hungry Howie's allows me to do that and still feel ok about myself in the morning.  It's not best pizza, but for chain-style stuff, I'd put it head and shoulders above most of the competition.   The flavored crusts are a nice touch too.  

There's always some specials running, so a little cash can go a long way.  On repeated visits the service has been consistently friendly, which is always appreciated.  Turnaround time on orders is usually pretty good too.  I've never had to wait more than 45 minutes on a Friday night at dinner time, and often it's been quicker. 

Hungry Howie's isn't great pizza, but it is good pizza, and that's a-ok by me."}
{"text":"After two years of living around hungry Howie's and eating there so many times, I feel ashamed of the review I left before. So this edit. Complete overhaul...
Hungry Howie's is great pizza for an awesome price. Cheese is awesome and their paid crust asiago cheese is my favorite. If you are looking for a free crust and don't mind great flavored spice, I suggest Cajun crust. If you hate spicy, sesame is the right one for you, also free. Can't go wrong with hh."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars! 

I had never been to a Hungry Howie's before.  I was browsing online, wanted some pizza, but also didn't want to shell out more than $8.00.  Options were limited, so I decided to give Hungry Howie's a try.  They were close to my work, had a coupon for a small, 2 topping pizza for $5.00, and since I had never been here before, it would be a new place to check out.  I placed my order online, went down to pick it up, and here is how it was.

Small Pepperoni and Onion Pizza-  First things first.  When I put the pizza in my car, I got a weird smell going on.  It smelled like a pot roast that had been sitting in the slow cooker all day.  WTF is that, right?  How does a pizza smell like pot roast?  At that point, I was just hoping for a decent pizza and hoping I didn't have to trash the whole thing.  I opened the box, and the first thing I noticed was that the cardboard was soaked in butter/grease.  I had ordered my pizza with a \"butter crust\", and they weren't joking around.  It was almost saturated with their butter flavoring/topping.  Did this hurt the pizza?  Nope..not at all.  It was actually one of the best parts of the pizza!  I picked up a slice and dug in.  It had a nice, stringy, tasty cheese, some crisp pepperoni, and a handful of onions (wish it had more onions on it).  The crust had a bunch of tiny air bubbles in it which made for a nice crunch/chew and that butter crust made it somewhat moist, but not soggy.  I actually thought it was a pretty darn good pizza.  I ate my 6 slices and was stuffed!

Overall, I liked it more than I thought I would have.  Compared to other \"chain pizzas\", this was actually better than most.  I prefer this over Little Caesars \"Hot and Ready\" pizza, by far!  The cheese, crust and toppings were all better (Still can't fuck with LC's Deep Dish...that shit is amazing!) and it was around the same price.  Am I racing to come back here?  Meh, maybe not.  Will I be back though?  Yes.  For a cheap, fast pizza that is close to work, this fits the bill and was a pretty decent lunch!"}
{"text":"so f-ing done. pizza is not bad, but the godamn instructions can't make it ten feet from the front counter to the pizza without getting messed up someway. No I dont want another free pizza, i want the first one i ordered done right. i have only got pizza here four time and you screwed up twice."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's is my favorite run of the mill cheap pizza place in Lakewood. Whether we pick it up or have it delivered, it's always hot. The pizza itself isn't overly impressive, but the flavored crusts are great and they always have a good coupon/deal available. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a straight forward pizza to sit and eat while watching a movie."}
{"text":"Really cheap, delicious and savory pizza, and nice workers!  Went here the night we got to the Phoenix area as it was the only thing open near the Sheraton hotel in Tempe, and we loved it so much."}
{"text":"Garlic & herb crust on chicken pizza- ask to cook a little extra for more crispy! There Greek salad is good also!"}
{"text":"Prefer this pizza over Little Caesars any day! Really like the thin butter crust. Whenever we order pizza from this location, it gets devoured in minutes! Personally never had a problem with delivery or pickup. The location is a little sketchy at night. We are usually the only car there past 8pm. 

The bread you can buy as a side is extremely salty. That is the only thing we have ordered, and not been happy with. Wayyyy too much seasoning. The texture was similar to eating bread dipped in dirt. 

The cinnamon bread is a great dessert! You get quite a lot, and we never save it past the day we buy it. (It gets pretty hard.) 

You definitely get what you pay for. Don't expect high quality pizza. We went in expecting bad pizza, and were pleasantly surprised with a delicious and affordable dinner! Can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"This franchise must be under new ownership. The pizza was horrible and the service from owner, Russell, was even worse. Pizza was delivered without the ordered root beer and pepsi. The pizza was delivered cold and  terribly uncooked.The owner was rude and disrespectful I asked for a corporate contact phone number or email and was told to \"Go figure it out yourself.\" Then Russell hung up on me! I will NEVER order from Hungry Howie's again."}
{"text":"I used to order from a different location all the time while in college. I was feeling nostalgic, so I put an order in online.

I ordered the pizza around 4:30-5:00pm on a Monday. It took an hour to get to me, which I was fine with.

I regretted my decision immediately.

First of all, it took like all of the toppings slid to one side of the pizza, leaving some of the cheese on its original side. Secondly, The crust and pizza, in general, were so soggy that I couldn't even lift or separate the pieces. The whole thing tasted like salty, watery, cheese bread. It was gross.

My wings weren't very good either. They were soggy as well.

I will never go or recommend this place to anyone ever again."}
{"text":"This is normally a solid three to four star review but, as a small business owner, I have seen their employees buying hard drug paraphenalia directly before shift.  I will no longer order food from this establishment."}
{"text":"Do you like giving dutch ovens to your partner? To yourself? Do you just like farting a lot? If you answered yes to any of those questions, call this place up and order the pizza with butter cheese crust. Do it on a Friday or Saturday night so you can be ripping all night while you try to pick up chicks! And if you do succeed, you can hit them off with that dutch oven!"}
{"text":"At the end of my stint in Kent, Hungry Howies opened up. This store was responsible for giving some poor girl more dutch ovens than she could shake a stick at!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. So are the wings. You can get flavored crust (I get the ranch crust). They deliver. You can't sit down inside to eat so don't even think about it haha. Workers are polite. We order from here all the time. I recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Personally, I love their $5, one topping, large pizza with free flavored crust. 

They have many crust flavors to choose from.But my favorite, hand's down, is the garlic and herb. YUM!!! 

The pizza itself is fairly standard and tasty for a takeout pizza.

I will mention though that while this pizza tastes great fresh, it is not particularly great when reheated. Some pizzas taste better the next day...this is not one of them. It is ok reheated or cold but no where near as good as other pizza chains for leftovers.

(Please note, the $5 price is only valid at a handful of locations.)"}
{"text":"Pizza is good but I paid a dollar more for toppings all the time and they always skimp on it...

Example- I can count the mushrooms in the pizza, not to mention they're razor thin hahaha. That's, seven razor thin slices of mushroom for a dolla extra??? Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I love Hungry Howies, except for the people that run this one. If you ever want pizza delivered, you may as well forget it.
Ordered a pizza today at 8:30 and it got here at 10:00. I tried talking to the manager and couldn't get to him and when I did for some reason he was pretending not to hear me. After that I called back and asked if he could here me and said yes, I proceeded to ask if it was the manager and he hung up on me. On top of talking to them asking why my order was taking so long, they never gave me an apology or sympathized for the long time they took. I am very disappointed with their horrible customer service and hope something will be done. Never EVER have pizza delivered from this location."}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order online and received a call from this place that my order gonna take one hour, i got it after one hour and half , cold , doesnt taste good."}
{"text":"We were very pleased to discover one of these in Las Vegas, a big bonus that there was one somewhat close to home.  Cajun crust is the only way to go!"}
{"text":"This is my second order placed for delivery and the food is always hot, delivery is on time and the pizza is good for a $10 Large. The brownies arrive in a box of like 6 or 8 and are the perfect snack for late night since,, the pizza is filling with the flavored crust. I'd pick Hungry Howie's over Pizza Hut. If you get the  salad, it's more than enough for one person. My order is saved in their computer so, when you call in, they have your order history which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Being from Florida, Hungry Howies is one of our favorite quick pizza places.

After several trips to this location over the past few months I just can't give them any higher than 3 stars. 

Love the taste of the crust, especially the garlic! The sauce is not as rich as other pizza joints. They seem to use a lot of cheese and veggies - meat lovers looks hearty with meat also.

My main issue is the amount of time we wait each and every time we go in for pizza. The other night rather than call it in, we went there and ordered. One cheese/pepperoni pizza, Veggie Pizza, Turkey Club, and Howie Bread. Not a lot but we ended up waiting 25 minutes for our order. The thing that made me the angriest was the fact that our pizza and sub sat on the counter for an additional 7 minutes while we waited for the howie bread. They did bring the order out to us at the table and apologized for the wait. 

I am hopeful in the future they will get there act together. I just don't feel like there is any rush there unless you call in the order and get it delivered? But than we must tip and get charged a delivery fee. Just not worth it.

We will continue to eat there because it is a great value for a larger family. But might have to see what other competitors can match them ;)"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I really love Hungry Howie's pizza. I have been eating healthy and going to the gym and decided to reward myself with some hungry howies. However, I called this evening at 4:50 PM to order and the phone rang and rang with no answer. I tried calling back again and the person answered saying \"hungry howies, hold please.\" Ten minutes and 5 seconds passed before I got irritated and hung up. Just had my fiancé try calling and it just kept ringing and ringing. Either they are understaffed or that guy just hates his job. Will not be going to this hungry howies ever again."}
{"text":"The theme of tonight, coupons! Yeah, i hit Dave's Cosmic Subs and Howie's for a bargain bonanza of unhealthy grub. This coupon was $5 off of a $20 order. I've been here many times(they send a lot of coupons), but I try to refrain from reviewing franchises. That said, here's the skinny(appropriate word for pizza?): The extra large black olive with ranch crust was 14 bucks and was on par with Gepetto's or Roman Fountain. Not great, not horrible. 
The Howie bread was 3 bucks and is good with coffee in lieu of breadsticks or biscotti. Trying to get up to 20 was hard without ordering wings. Oh, how i f*cking miss wings! So i got the cajun bread at $3. It  is spicy and will probably go well with a soup later in the week. 
Grand total=15 dollars. Combined with my Dave's purchase that made about $32 worth of food come in at around $20. Now i can use the scratch to get that tattoo of the Notre Dame fighting Irish guy i've always wanted. Just in time for St. Patty's day."}
{"text":"The food quality is completely inconsistent and the customer service is non existent. Tonight, I logged in and ordered a pizza. My husband went to pick the pizza up, and they said the order was not there. I checked, and apparently I had made a mistake as the order was sent to the Hungry Howie's in the university area despite historically only ordering at this location. As a courtesy, I called the University area to inform them of my error and let them know no one would be picking the pizza up. They offered to cancel the order and refund it without my asking out of good customer service. Meanwhile I re ordered to the south blvd location, and my husband sat there as they ignored him for over 40 minutes. The result: a cold pizza that was completely wrong and employees talking about my husband and our order as he sat there while simultaneously ignoring him for 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I dont know if it's because I'm from philly and things are made different or what but I dont like the pizza. My husband loves it because the sauce is sweet. I've given them chances and even tried the calazone. In philly they are made with cheeses, sauce on the side, with anything in the inside.  Here they make it like a sandwich with butter melted. Just messy to me. Its hard to find a good pizza."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO! After an hour of waiting for the food, I decided to call and guess what? You guessed it...the food was just getting into the oven. i was then told another 15 minutes which ended up being 35 minutes. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never left a review of a restaurant before, however, my experience was so bad that I felt compelled write one. I wish I could give Hungry Howie's a score less than one star. After ordering a veggie pizza and a pepperoni and sausage pizza around 7pm we received a veggie pizza with pepperoni and sausage on it and another pepperoni and sausage pizza at about 8:30pm. We called to explain the issue we were told that they would give us a $3 credit (which was what we were overcharged.)  We told them that we still wanted a veggie pizza since I do not eat pork and they said that they would bring us a veggie pizza. At 10pm an hour and a half after calling back having never received the pizza we called back again to check the status. At that point the manager told us that the driver came to the apartment and no one answered. Even though they never called, we never left the house, and we were sitting in the front room of the house the whole time. The manager then apologizes again and says that even though they have the veggie pizza we ordered there on the warmer they will make a new pizza and bring it over. Twenty something minutes later the pizza was delivered cold so it obviously wasn't a new pizza. What makes the whole situation even worse is their pizza alone would only be worth 2 maybe 3 stars without all the other issues. We will never be ordering from Hungry Howie's again and I urge you to think twice before ordering from them. You will be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I got a pizza from here because I received a coupon for a free pizza. I ordered a cheese and sausage pizza with the garlic herb crust. It really didn't trip my trigger. The pizza reminded me of a Little Caesar's hot and ready at a higher price. Granted this one was free, but I wouldn't have paid $8.00 for a one topping medium pizza here. additional toppings are almost 2 bucks. The crust was flavored with a salty garlic herb coating around the perimeter of the crust like a margarita glass. This flavor was too intense to eat that part of the crust. There are enough other pizza places in the area, so I will continue to patronize my current favorites."}
{"text":"After waiting 2 hours for delivery the driver dropped off the wrong order.  Tried calling and i got hung up on.  Drove down there and demanded a refund.  I was told the credit card machine was down.  We will see if I get a refund."}
{"text":"Yelp should include a \"i did/didn't eat there because of the previous reviews.\"  All I can say is I'm hungry, and I want dinner, but there is no way I will order from this place because I'm old, and I want to get my food before I die.  Thanks to all of the people who gave honest reviews."}
{"text":"As good as delivered pizza gets, lots of toppings to choose from, flavored crust, decent wings"}
{"text":"Ordered thru Yelp before I was even home. Grabbed an Uber and headed for the house. Pizza took an extra 20 minutes on top of the 40 min clock yelp showed. Pizza wasn't bad but definitely not a classic or favorite. I would probably not order again with all the options out there."}
{"text":"Very good food fast delivery and easy order process. I'd recommend this pizza place to everyone. They always have great deals if you check out the coupon on the website. Cajun crust and Cajun bread are my favorite. Give it a try I dear you."}
{"text":"Decent and inexpensive pizza. I chose HH's because, well, they were in my credit card's rewards program and I needed one more \"dine\" before the end of the year. I've been past this place lots of times and never thought to stop because of Luigi's.

Today I got a medium \"Howie Maui\" which is their name for the classic Hawaiian pizza with pineapple and ham. Well topped with plenty of both, it was plenty hot and it didn't take long at all. I do like quick service!

As far as the chain pizzas go, I would put Howie's ahead of Pizza Hut and far ahead of Domino's, maybe it's almost as good as Papa John's. But like so many things, pizza is a very personal choice. You likely feel different.

If I'm ever looking for a variety of pizzas for a party or a lunch, I think Hungry Howie's would be a good choice. But if I was just looking for a slice, I'd look to Luigi's.

Note: Some people drive this parking lot very quickly. Be careful."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the guys at the counter greeted us. They were genuine to our kids also. Definitely personable. I'm in the car writing this review while our food is being prepared. I don't even care if the pizza is bad (which i highly doubt) their customer service was amazing and that alone is why i will come back."}
{"text":"How this place has gotten by me for years, I have no idea.  I thought they were a single shop, but they actually have a number of locations all over the valley.

The pizza is phenomenal!  Try the 3 cheeser pleaser, which comes with pepperoni.  Their cheesy bread is also fabulous, buttery, cheesy, while managing to not be too oily.  I've also had wings and salads and we enjoy everything we get there.

They always have specials going on and it's one of the cheapest dinners around!  They deliver, too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because the kids were hungry, yet again.  The pizza is made to order and their speciality is flavored crust made with different flavors including onion, butter cheese, garlic herb, and sesame.  We opted for original.  I like the pizza size options.  Medium is quite a bit and was plenty for the three of us to have a snack after we'd already had dinner.  The place was pretty busy as I guess there are a lot of hungry kids coming out of the dance studio."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when I ordered delivery.  When I got my pizza it was on one side of the box. I was charged for ranch but never received it and then my cinnamon bread was hard as a rock. I just wish that I could get a pizza deliver just once from you that I could enjoy."}
{"text":"Alright pizza but my decision to order delivery from them will never happen again since the driver ran over my solar light in my front yard...."}
{"text":"I cant believe there are not that many reviews, and bad ones too! This place is great!! Never had any issues. Very good pizza, actually one of the best I've tried. Try their Philly Steak, i get it all the time. Im a pizza junkie and I've tried almost anything out there. So Hungry Howies and Jets are #1 pizzas places so far."}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24.  We had the Greek salad, the antipasto salad, and the turkey club calzone.  They were all delicious.  Well truthfully the turkey club calzone was BOMB but I got to taste it (on a diet) so salad it was for me.  Delivery was right on time.  Definitely will save this place for future deliveries."}
{"text":"I am a Hungry Howie's junkie.  My only complaint is that they don't have a location close enough to Uptown to deliver.

I love the dough, the cheese, the sauce, and when I'm trying to be good, even the salad is legit (as an appetizer).

Coming from someone who rotates her pizza delivery places so she doesn't embarrass herself at any one of them with her commitment to the pizza diet, Hungry Howie's is definitely the winner in the Pizza Hut vs. Domino's vs. Papa Johns vs. Little Ceasers debate.  Freaking YUM."}
{"text":"Love hungry howies , only bad thing i can say is they dont have one close to my house in phoenix"}
{"text":"I am in love with the subs here especially the steak and cheese one its delicious I really hate that I'm dieting right now because if I could I would probably get a steak and cheese sub every single day they're basically like calzones they're pretty big I get a small and I have half for dinner and then the next day have the other half for lunch so filling and so reasonably priced just delicious"}
{"text":"No complaints about Hungry Howie's. The flavors and crust make the pizza. For the price, you can't beat this pizza anywhere. I've never seen it busy. We usually call ahead and pick up the pizza in store. It never takes them more than 15-20 minutes to make it. Delivery is pretty quick too. 
Our favorites are thin crust with pineapple and ham, butter cheese and garlic crust and original round with pepperoni and jalapeños, butter cheese and garlic crust. I'm not big on their Howie bread but my husband swears by it. 
Doesn't usually cost us over $20. 
10/10, haven't been anywhere else since moving to this side of town and discovering the place."}
{"text":"Okay if you're looking for gourmet pizza, keep scrolling.  If your looking for cheap pizza to feed a group or to revert back to your college hay days this is your jam. 

Don't get fancy though, large pepperoni for 8.99 with extra butter cheese crust will tantalize your tastebuds and likely make you feel so guilty you'll even get yourself to the gym day after. 

Yelp has a free breadstick coupon if you order the bread (Freehb) and if you order through the website they have all their coupons on there to apply before you check out."}
{"text":"The wings, cheese bread, and calzones are all excellent.  The pizza is good, but not great.  The various flavored crusts though really help.  Definitely happy they made it up to N. Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok.  Just got off the phone after talking to Hungry Howies for 10 minutes. The \"assistant manager\" known as Kendra on the phone claims that she doesn't have the ability to comp anything for me and that there was nothing in the system under my number saying that we had a free caramel brownie (last delivery person forgot it and the manager said it would be credited to my account for next time). She was rude as fu*k, would not tell me when the manager was going to be there just that he \"shows up whenever he wants\" and I should \"keep calling back to check if he's here\". I am absolutely furious with that place! This place lacks integrity, do not believe anything they tell you over the phone. If my order shows up at all I wouldn't be surprised if it's covered in spit. Disgusting humans. PS,  last time they showed up on my doorstep they delivered the wrong order and made us wait 1.5hrs total only to forget several items upon return. Stay away, go to another pizza joint. One that cares about their customers and it's own reputation."}
{"text":"What awesome pizza. I 1st had this pizza in Michigan where I lived and it's still awesome. Also the service with Amy was excellent. She gave me the special with 3 toppings and I ate it all."}
{"text":"Our family loves Hungry Howies!  This particular location has always been friendly!  The service has been great and delivery seamless.  I enjoy the multitude of options they offer and I really enjoy their deals!  This is our number one pizza spot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The fiancé loves Hungry Howies, so we frequent this location! They always have good deals, the most recent time was buy a large get the second for $.29 (happy leap year!). Always tasty, love the butter cheese crust! I do NOT like their bacon, for reference. I feel like it tastes fake, but other than that, I like what I've tried."}
{"text":"Called for takeout, was told it'd be 20 minutes. Got there and was told they don't have my order. I verified I had called the right one, and apparently they just hadn't bothered logging my order. Fine, mistakes happen. But the guy behind the counter decided to be a jerk about it instead of trying to make it right. Last time I eat here."}
{"text":"In terms of fast food pizza, Howie's is probably my drug of choice. Their prices are fair and the flavored crusts are pretty good. I also like the sandwiches or maybe a greek salad if I'm feeling lazy but want something a bit more green."}
{"text":"I ordered from Hungry Howie's many times and they never disappoint. I think their pizzas have a fresh taste and I like the flavored crust. The cinnamon bread is excellent too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hungry howie's location. Because of their $5 large 1 topping pizza, it definitely makes it the one with the best deals. They're always friendly when I go in there and if you're a regular they remember you. I recommend this place to anyone in Tempe even if they don't drive to you."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's has become one of my fall backs for evenings when I don't want to leave home, and need food delivered. They accurately gauge how long it will take for you to receive your order, and the delivery drivers are very courteous. On weekends they deliver until 3am. Thursday until midnight, and the rest of the week until 11pm. You can call or order online.

I've only had their pizza a couple of times, but it was ok, and prepared as I ordered it. My real favorite is the Antipasto Salad. It is hearty, generally good for two meals, and loaded with all sorts of wicked cold cuts that I should not eat, but love. I don't particularly care for their dressings, but have plenty of my own at home anyway. 

In addition to ordering meals delivered, I have picked up at their store on occasion. Their staff has always been friendly, helpful, courteous and fast"}
{"text":"Pizza came fast, hot and delicious. What more can you ask for.....oh yeah, howie bread. Awesome. Try the butter cheese crust."}
{"text":"Pizza was hella salty -- other than that, average. Deliver guy was cool (if that makes up for anything)"}
{"text":"Had a calzone  steak cheese and well it was a piss poor one at that 1 slice of meat they could of Done better then that I will say the dough was good that was about all it had going for it. Maybe they should rethink their calzones and put effort into them."}
{"text":"Hungry Howie's is a good option if you don't want to spend a ton of money on a pizza (it's cheap!) and don't want to patronize one of the mediocre \"big three\" (Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's). 

I'd say this pizza is colossally less greasy than all of those- especially Pizza Hut! I swear I go through a whole roll of paper towels blotting all the grease off that garbage! 

Blech!

As far as Hungry Howie's, the sauce could stand to be a tad bit sweeter, but it's still tasty pizza and I love all the flavored crust options. 

Butter cheese being my personal fave. Yum!

I will say the delivery inexplicably took almost an hour (for one pizza), so don't order from this HH if you truly want \"fast\" food!"}
{"text":"Incredibly low prices for the food, and the food is average - which means this is a good deal.  No complaints, no bad tastes, just rather average.  Butter crust was somewhat buttery and the 3-cheese bread had nice herbs on it as well.  Exceeded expectations for the price.  Good review is primarily because of value, in case you haven't noticed."}
{"text":"If you look at my other reviews, you'll see I very rarely give a restaurant 1 bubble. And for local places in my community, I will often say nothing if I don't have anything nice to say. But this experience was so thoroughly terrible I'm making an exception. A friend visiting from out of state was thrilled we had a Hungry Howie's in our town as this was her favorite pizza chain back east. Since we had not had a chance to try it yet, we gave it a go. First we tried ordering on the web site but it does not allow you to select a flavor for the crust - that seemed odd considering how much they promote this and rely on it to differentiate themselves from all the other pizza joints in town. OK, so we tried calling our order in. We had seen the specials on the web site, but when we asked for it on the phone, a teenage-sounding guy told us they didn't have that promotion and it would cost roughly double the advertised price. At this point I started getting annoyed, but I kept calm and ordered on, after all, our friend loves this place, maybe the food will redeem it. Since we were already out and about, we declined delivery and went in to get it. Imagine my surprise when we saw the front of the building was plastered with large advertisements exactly matching what we saw online. There were also posters and stands inside the restaurant showing these same deals. Really?! How could this guy NOT know the specials they offer? Does he come in through the back door every day? Does he never look left when he answers the phone? I probably should have said something, but at this point it was worth the extra money to not prolong any interaction with this person. I paid and left. At home we realized they never offered us a choice of dipping sauces for the bread sticks and that the pizza did not have the flavored crust we ordered. The bread sticks were burnt and tough. We tried to eat a couple but ended up throwing them away, which if you know me is atypical - I will eat terrible food rather than waste it, but this was beyond edible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, but the cheap ingredients and \"canned\" tasting sauce put it below average. Our friend assured us she has never had this experience at the other stores she has been to, that even the web site is better for other stores, and that we just have a bad one. Until this location brings its customer service and product quality up to the standards the chain apparently sets for its other locations, there is no chance we will be returning."}
{"text":"HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.  

As for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated."}
{"text":"I don't know how people eat this stuff. It smells nasty, and it tastes like someone tried throwing herbs inside of crust and then lathering it with a coating of lard cheese product. The sauce is over salty. In fact the entire thing is way over salty. My boyfriend likes it on occasion (his guilty pleasure) but I gag when he opens the box. WAY too over priced for such a low quality pizza. I'd rather pick up a Fresheta frozen pizza at Safeway."}
{"text":"They offer several online order deals; however you  cannot pay cash via the website. Unfortunately, when I tried to contact the corporate office to ask why, I spoke to more than one person who had NO idea this is an issue."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Love the flavored crust options. We have to drive 15 minutes to pick up but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it said 40 minutes. Waited an hour and 15 min before we finally called, the guy said it was still on the \"make\" screen and would be another hour and a half!!! If there was a no star option I would put it. Ended up cancelling our order."}
{"text":"I placed a order at 9:06 p.m. I've called 3 times and it 10:49 p.m. and I am still waiting for my delivery plus they already took the money out of my account I've called and they're closed bad service"}
{"text":"Fast Delivery and Great Pizza! I only wish there was one downtown where I work!"}
{"text":"I'm always a little cautious when it comes to trying to new places & I prepare myself to expect the worst but this place actually took me by surprise! I ordered the stuffed crust pizza for carry out, my order was made very quickly & I had no issues when picking it up & the pizza was delicious. I give 4 stars because the flavor of the crust (garlic herb) was a bit over the top for me & also part of the lobby was taped off & paint containers were all over the floor which I feel isn't the best thing for a business that sells food but other than that it wasn't a bad place at all."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza in the world, but they are quick, the pizza is good, and affordable.  I love the garlic herb crusts that you can choose for your pizza.
This place is really for pick up or delivery only."}
{"text":"Holy moly does this place have some low standards for their employees! I called in our order and it took me repeating everything 3 to 4 times to get it right. I worked the phone portion at a pizza place and it's not that hard. The computer set up is simple enough an 8 yr old could do it. When my husband went to pick it up he said t was like a glorified Little Cesear's  and he had to explain the coupon all over again to them. 
The pizza was decent though for the price. I like that there is different crust flavors to choose from. Hopefully they get some better customer service because people won't be returning with the current employees they have."}
{"text":"Hungry Howies is the best! Good Pizza and the kids actually eat the flavored crust, I love it when I don't have to eat everyone's left over crust just so we don't waste! Register and order online and you get a free medium one topping pizza! They also offer great deals online any day of the week."}
{"text":"We (4) gathered at my son's house to watch the Greenbay/ 49ers game @ 6:00pm got hungry and ordered pizza and wings from HH's pizza
(35th ave. and Union Hills location) online. The ordering process was a little confusing  but got through it ok. We ordered 2 med. pizzas (1 cheese and 1 tomato, onion and ham), 1 order bread sticks, and 10 piece hot wings. $35-$40 including tip. Wait time was told 45 mins. but came in about 30 mins. Surprising on a game night and Saturday to boot! Arrived nice and hot but sadly the food was mediocre at best. Pizza was OK, bread sticks OK, wings a little salty but OK. Really not much better than Little Caesar's overall. The same order would have been about $20 cheaper but no delivery. The Packers lost too which didn't help any. Oh well...there is always next year! Had fun none the less! Would I go back to Hungry Howies? Probably not."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza. They understand what extra cheese means! That being said, why only three stars? 

The people are jerks! Seriously, every time I order, they act like your doing them a favor to treat you like crap. I had the manager take my order this evening, Vanessa, good grief. I'm sorry for adding something to my order so I can spend more money at your establishment. Geez...
But the delivery guys are always nice :)"}
{"text":"When i worked at buyers i would order lunch here all the time. subs are amazing hot ham and cheese is my favorite they so big you can barely eat a whole they also have flavor crusts for the pizza so you make it to your preference. Been here about a dozen times you should just try it nobody makes a sub like these guys.oh and the delivery is fast and always on time never missed a meal at work because they arrived late or didn't show. Very good quality"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Hungry Howie's was all the way in Florida while I was on vacation.  It was late, we were hungry, and Hungry Howie's was close.  They were almost closed but they accommodated us and hooked us up with some wicked delicious pizza.  That's when I got hooked. 

We ordered some HH pizza the other night because we were feeling lazy.  We got 1 small bacon cheeseburger pizza (mozzarella, cheddar, bacon, and hamburger) and 1 philly cheesteak pizza (cheese sauce, steak, peppers, mushrooms, onions, and provolone cheese).  These were so delicious, we completely scarfed them down.  Gluttonous, yes but totally worth it.  HH is everything a pizza place should be, cheap, fast, and delicious.  I only take away one star because they are not closer to downtown."}
{"text":"The garlic herb crust is sooooo good!! When you order online, you have the option to totally customize your pizza from the dough, to the amount of sauce, and how much cheese which is very helpful for picky eaters. They deliver fast and always have nice drivers."}
{"text":"God this place is so far from downtown!  It is totally worth the drive though.  The Philly Cheese Steak pizza was an amazing concoction that only someone who smokes a ton of weed could ever come up with.  The order was easy and was ready when I got there so no complaints from any point.  Would go back in a heartbeat but damn - build one downtown!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from here on multiple occasions. And every time there is some issue. From being extremely late to over cooked and burnt. Bu today I decided to try again. I am very upset. I received my pizza cold. I've never had a pizza delivered cold. The crust was hard, cheese not fresh tasting and super cold. I will not order from this location again.."}
{"text":"The food is great it's probably my favorite pizza place. The staff is alright usually just get it delivered but don't have problems with them when I do go"}
{"text":"The pizza here is convenient for pickup and most likely also delivery but I was in the area so I just dropped by and ordered and didn't have to wait that long.  The pizza was basic and the prices were average.  When you're looking to feed a bunch of people, this might be a good option, especially a bunch of kids."}
{"text":"The reason it's called Hungry Howies is because they don't deliver.... DO NOT ORDER HERE!!! Subpar poor quality product and the WORST customer service ever. The girl who answered was so out of it that it took ten minutes to order a small cheese pizza and wings. Learn your menu darling. I'm using exact terms from the menu to order and she was confused what a \"build your own\" small cheese pizza was. After dealing with the barely working website I called this location as a second option. I clearly gave her my EXACT address and she said it would be about 40 minutes. Well over 30 minutes goes by and I get a call to clarify the address. When I repeat the address she says oh I thought you said. ....  .... this. Her mistake as I respeated the address numerous times and she said I was very close. Across the street actually. Now I should also mention I'm from out of town and visiting. 

So now she gives me major attitude because of her mistake and says I've called the wrong store and that my order isn't coming. So I proceed to tell her she should have told me this over a half hour ago. With this she slams down the phone and hangs up. No apology or I'm sorry i screwed up etc etc.  Totally fckn rude. This employee should be fired immediately. She has zero skills and zero manners and should get ZERO stars. An hour wasted of my life ordering GMO trash I'll never get back.  Nasty nasty nasty fast food trash attitude. F U hungry howies. GFY!

{"text":"I am so livid!! Only reason i am giving them a one star is for the people and this particular store location. First off when i arrived and ordered my pizza and breadsticks after waiting for 5 to 10 minutes now someone wants to tell me that they were out of mushrooms so i have to choose another topping , so the young girl goes on to say well your breadsticks are done already well \"ummm those are going to be cold then aren't they i replied\"? She replied \" no we put them in a warmer\". As i shake my head in disbelief i then notice one of the employees there had this humongous afro with the hungry howie hat on and no hair net no nothing. Now im thinking when is this nightmare going to be over??!! So again after 30 minutes later the guy in the back yells to the front oh i found some mushrooms im going to go ahead and put them on your pizza. Yall don't even know the half of my facial expressions like have you not already made the pizza young man and i have been sitting in here now for 30 minutes?! It wont take long he replied. It literally took a hour before i was out of there just for this reason i am now over hungry howies for running such a irresponsible location. Im sitting here now eating this pizza that you would think came straight off the plane from paris because it took an hour before they actually handed to me from the time i walked in and ordered, and we ended up throwing away the breadsticks they were cold and hard. Stay away from this location."}
