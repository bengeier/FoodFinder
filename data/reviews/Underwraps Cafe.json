{"text":"Hey kids, long time no see. It's been a while, hasn't it. I've been taking sabbatical for some months now and have got a hefty chunk of reviews to get through, so let's get it started...  Underwraps is in a nondescript corner in a nondescript strip mall next to a nondescript campus of DeVry University on Dunlap not far the MetroCenter. I know that's way more than enough to entice you to go there.  I myself never even noticed this place until today, even though I've probably driven past it a thousand times. But for some reason, it caught my eye today, and I thought it sounded like a great option for lunch, although a \"wrap\" joint seemed a little out of place in this neighborhood.   I walked up to the door and looked at the menu. 8 choices for wraps, including albacore tuna salad, cheese steak, scrambled egg & bacon, Asian chicken, and grilled veggie. Choice of tortillas are flour, whole wheat, spinach, and tomato-basil. Also a few salads and a couple foccacia sandwiches.   The place is very casual, independently-run and local - with a few friendly ladies working behind the counter. I choose the grilled vegetable with tomato basil ($6.50). The lady asks me about what kind of complimentary side I want. Here's where if you're a starch fiend, you'll be stoked, because the choices are....potatoes (french fries).....potatoes (homemade chips)....or potatoes (oily potato salad). But that's it. If you're trying to cut down on your lunchtime glycemic spike so you can actually be awake for your 2 pm meeting, you're out of luck (of course, you could just decline a side....but why the hell would you do that? It's free!). I chose the potato salad. For some reason I didn't feel as guilty.  Even though I was the only one ordering at the counter when I got there, there were at least 5 or 6 wraps being made before mine, indicating this place gets a lot of call-in orders. Eventually I got my food and dug in. I'd say the wrap, which was full of kalamata olives, grilled squash, roasted green peppers, red onion, and romaine lettuce with a lemon vinaigrette, was pretty good. The container of potato salad, albeit oily, was sprinkled with fresh chopped scallions and also tasty. No mayo here. Just sauteed chopped potatoes with herbs.   I'd say all in all I liked what I ate and I appreciate the fact that this place exists here. The downside is that I can't help comparing it to That's A Wrap, which trumps it when it comes to wrap selection as well as the variety of sides, but in the end, what Underwraps does, it does well. I'll be back to try a few of the other ones, because, well, it beats getting the same sandwich at Subway every single day.  I'm going to give it 3.49 stars and would recommend it to anyone who works or lives closeby looking for a less artery-clogging lunch option.   Open M-F 10am-7pm (and btw, the Yelp! map for this place is jacked - just look for DeVry on Dunlap and it's the stripmall right next to it)."}
{"text":"Since Mr. K's excellent review, Underwraps has made a few changes. (Hey! Maybe they read your review?) You can now order salads (five types from Asian or Greek to Caesar or Cobb) and the sides to chose from include potato chips (which ROCK and are made in-house), potato salad or pasta salad (they scratched the fries).   The grilled vegetable wrap IS tasty: kalamata olives, grilled squash, roasted green peppers, red onion, lemon vinaigrette, but I also really like to do the scrambled egg (crispy bacon, caramelized onion, tomato and melted provolone cheese). They even make it egg whites only for me!  I do think a lot of their business is catering... and they've got some good offers. You can serve 11-14 people assorted wraps for just $50!   This place is close to where I work and it's not generally too crowded, so it's easy enough to get in and out. I'm gonna round up and give it four stars for taste and convenience!"}
{"text":"I went over there to try it out for lunch today.  I haven't had a lot of wraps so I don't have much to compare it to.  I should have ordered something with meat so I had at least something to compare it to but no, as I was being adventurous I got the grilled vegetables on tomato-basil. I thought it was was pretty good, but I might have preferred one of the other offerings.  I also got the potato chips.  For some reason I had it in my head that chips made right there would be thicker.  They were however devoid of any staleness you can get with bagged chips.  I will be back again to try something else.  On the way over there I was thinking this would be better on a Saturday because it is about 20 minutes in traffic each way from work.  Well, the website doesn't show it yet but they are now open Saturdays!  Two pleasant guys were working behind the counter and had several orders going at once even though I was the only one there.  I was greeted by the cook as soon as I walked in and shortly thereafter the person filling orders and such took my order.  The delivery driver was in and out a couple of times while I was there.   Being a nice day out I sat at the outside tables, there was just enough breeze and no sun on the North side of the building to make it feel much cooler than it really was.  If I had been smart I would have pulled a table and chair out in the sun like another person did while I was eating."}
