{"text":"Good little bar close to home.  The food there is excellent. Good ole bar food. Only downfall is they don't accept debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten or drank here, but a mechanical mishap on a recent bike ride brought me hobbling (tight cycling clothing and all) into here in search of a crescent wrench. The owner left the bar, went home, grabbed a wrench for me, and offered to call up the road to his buddies who own an auto shop in case my repair didn't hold.  That's a real Pittsburgh class act. Kudos. Will come back and buy a bunch of beers."}
{"text":"The food just isn't impressive. We ordered wings and the flavor just isn't there, and they are very tiny.  However, the service was friendly and the beer/drinks are cheap! Very laid back/dive bar atmosphere. There's a pool table and \"fake\" slot machines, which I've never actually seen!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. These guys do unlimited $5 wings in Tuesday, and their sauces are great; but this is the second time I've been here that they've run out, this time by 8PM, and I didn't even get started!  Hope they get this figured out soon: I'm hungry!!"}
