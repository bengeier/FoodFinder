{"text":"I really love the ambiance a d basic set up of this restaurant. Unfortunately they really lack execution on their food. The menu has potential but is rather boring in itself and the flavors are even more boring.  I wish they could turn this around as I would love a good Italian place in mt horeb! I hate paying decent money for something I feel I could make better myself. Ho hum."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 15 years. It has changes hands a while ago but I think for the better. The Italian family who owned it won many awards for superior quality food and authenticity. With the new owners you still get most of that experience, but I think some minor errors still occur in perfect preparation of them qualities it had once had before. The restaurant recently spent \"what must be hundreds\" into a renovation. Its a very nice place to eat at now. Friday and Saturday nights can be very busy.  Service can be slower during them times but I just enjoy my company and drinks. A place I don't typically run from. Not really overpriced.  Average is about 15 dollars for a meal, and that includes bread and side salad for many of its meals on the menu. I would also suggest the fresh pizzas on offer. All in all, I would suggest anytime to anyone"}
{"text":"I love a lot about Mt. Horeb.  Sole & Sapori is sadly not one of those things.  The ambiance is nonexistant as you sit amongst dead or dying plants in a horrible 80s decor.  The worst part was the number of dead flies on the window sill.  Absolutely disgusting.  The wait staff is woefully undereducated about the food they serve.  There was a drink special the night we were there which was Mojitos (not very Italian) a beer from Capitol brewery and Sangria.  The waitress told us that the Mojitos were tequila based cocktails.  When asked about dishes she knew even less.  The food was interesting.  I had a calzone which had a nice flavor but was slathered in a marinara which ruined the dish.  The sauce could have been better.  It was overly sweet and tasted like it came from a can.  A little sauce would have been fine but it was like they were masking something.  It was just way over done.  Finally something good, the dessert.  We had a wonderful tiramusu.  It tasted great.  I think Sole has the potential to be a great italian restaurant in this town but it is just trying way too hard."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Sole Sapori quite frequently. Sam Vitale opened his restaurant in Mt Horeb in 1985 (originally called \"Pronto Pizza\") and he operated it until he retired in 2003 and retired back home to Sicily (where he was killed in a traffic accident)  At one time there were a bunch of Sole Sapori restaurants in the Madison area, but the others have all closed now.  I probably pick up pizza from Sole Sapori about 4 times a year. Their pesto pizza has always been a particular favorite of mine.  Just within the last few weeks I've had dinner in there twice, which is the first time I was there for dinner in YEARS. Spaghetti carbonara on one trip and tortellini in a garlic cream sauce this evening.  Dinner was served with a small side salad and italian bread with ainise seeds that had cheese melted on the top. (I\"ve always particularly liked the bread)  In both cases dinner was solidly okay but not great. They do have a nice little bar which is a good place for a quiet drink."}
{"text":"Mt Horeb being the kind of town that it is, you might not expect to find a decent restaurant, but we've gone here on two visits to the area (a yearly tradition). Both times we opted for entrees instead of pizzas. I've had their manicotti and salmon picada (I think?) with side of spaghetti and meat sauce and was impressed with both meals. I also stole some delicious bites of chicken parmigiana. We were also impressed with their rich desserts on our first visit. My girlfriend wanted to try something lighter on the second visit and ordered a lemon ice, which was served in a frozen lemon peel. Extra points for cool presentation. The pizza always smells good, and the Anise/Cheesy bread that comes with the entrees in very nice. It's casual and family friendly, at least in the mid-to-late afternoons, when we've been there."}
{"text":"I love this place! It is not like every other Italian restaurant in that it is purely based around a Sicilian family's recipes, which is why some other reviewers probably don't like it. This food is as homemade as you are going to get in Mt. Horeb and probably in most of the Madison area. The cook makes almost everything from scratch and you can tell! Delicious food all around and for a good price too!  The decor isn't the greatest, but it definitely makes you feel like you are somewhere other than little Mt. Horeb, Wisconsin which is an added bonus. Whenever I come to Wisconsin I make sure to eat at Sole Sapori, there is a reason it is one of the oldest businesses in Mt. Horeb :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here three times.  The first time we brought his parents, and everything was phenomenal.  The service was attentive without being pushy, and the food was spectacular enough to make us see the funky decor as \"quaint\" instead of \"gross.\"  The eggplant parm was amazing, and our appetizers of olive tapenade with pita chips got fought over at the table.  Sangria, a summertime special, was quite good. The hall is plastered with news articles about the owner, a school principal who opened this restaurant.  She was not in the kitchen that night, and we were excited to come back when she was.  The second time we went, we brought my parents, and the restaurant we had raved apart made us look like liars.  Granted, my eggplant lasagna was really good, but the poor girl waiting on us was harried, forgetful and terrified every time she had to come back to the table and tell us they were out of something - the appetizer we'd ordered, the dish my mom ordered, and finally iced tea.  ICED TEA? How does one run out of iced tea?  It literally takes 10 minutes to brew a pitcher, 3 to brew a glass.  (I'm from the South - I know iced tea.) My mom would do anything for a gelato, and we waited so long for her dessert to arrive that we finally just cancelled it, paid as quick as we could and ran for the door.  It was awful, and the owner was cooking that night.  We were baffled, so my husband and I decided we'd need a tie-breaker visit.  The third and most recent time we went it was great again.  I again got the eggplant parm (I wasn't trying to hedge my bets - it really was so good that first time).  We loved everything, again.  The waitress was awesome, the cocktails were great (the Basil Smash turned me into a gin drinker but was extraordinarily strong) and everyone in the dining room - three tables on a Friday - was having fun.  And guess what? The owner wasn't there that night either. I'm sure it's coincidental, but I can't help but think that the line might be running better on some nights that on others.  When we paid, the hostess asked how my drink as since she was bartending that night and did not know how.  How do you NOT schedule a bartender on a Friday night?  The consistency just isn't there - who knows what you'll get?  We out out to eat once every two weeks - on payday - and I'm not gambling that treat on Sole Sapori - it's just TOO hit and miss. If I'd rate it on times 1 and 3, I'd give it 5 stars, no doubt.  Time #2 would be 1 star.  So I'll rate according to the average....but be warned."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a higher rating but they still have some things to work out.  So many things are right: Outside appeal, rustic Italian charm inside, separate bar and waiting area, close ties to the community but their version of Italian is just not  mine.  The food is always just okay. It's not bad but it's not great.  When you are paying for pasta and sauce it should be cooked right.  After several meals here I have found some favorite pizzas and would definitely order them for take out next time."}
{"text":"I was seated in a little room near the kitchen, and although my server passed by several times, she forgot about me, and I waited 15 minutes before she came to take my order. After my food arrived, she didn't come back to check on me. Additionally, she didn't take away the extra place setting (silver wrapped in a paper napkin, paper placemat), a pet peeve. Also, if I'm paying $15.00 or more a plate, I kind of expect a real napkin. When asked about locally sourced ingredients, the server said they grow their own basil...to her credit, she was very pleasant. I had the vegie lasagne, and really don't know if it was good because it was swimming in red sauce (which, as other reviewers have pointed out, was VERY sweet). The meal was preceeded by a salad that had one cherry tomato and was covered in the house dressing, supposedly a vinaigrette, but it was mostly oil. I always order tiramisu if it's available and made in house...theirs was bland, but edible. I took half of it home, and forgot about it until days later - if it had been really good, I'd have scarfed it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came back on Valentine's 2014, which was on a Friday. Since Hubs loves this place for our V-Day tradition, I kept an open mind, and I was blown away by the meal and the service. Being the biggest dining holiday of the year, AND on a Friday, they looked like they were getting their asses handed to them when we showed up for our 6:30 reservation. Boy, was I wrong! Our hostess acknowledged us shortly after we arrived (poor thing was busy as a bee in spring!) and while she was checking on our table's availability, we had not one, but two other staff members make sure we'd been helped. I was sincerely impressed with how well they were on top of their game, and I overheard many other satisfied diners talking about how much they enjoyed their meal. One couple even managed to get the same table on V-Day that they sat at for their first date. How adorable is that??  Our server Stephanie was attentive without hovering, knowledgeable without talking our ears off, and she aced the most important element of our meal; she brought us our wine pronto--even when our first choice was sold out! In five years of coming here, I don't think we've ever gotten our drinks so quickly, which is a major bonus since we love our wine. She also timed our salads, appetizers, and entrees perfectly so that we didn't end up with a table full of dishes. This gal is a gem. I give her five stars, because waiting tables on Valentine's on a Friday night is rough, yet she made it look effortless. That takes talent.  Since we come here a few times a year, we ordered from the special V-Day menu. I had blue crab in cream and caper sauce over cannelloni. Hubs had the lobster in vodka/tomato cream sauce over cannelloni. Wowie! They were both delicioso! Way to knock that out of the ballpark, chefs! Please consider rotating these or adding them both to the permanent menu. It was so rich I saved half for lunch the next day, and it was a little bit of heaven. I'd like to have that again, please.  We brought home a tiramisu, and it was excellent as always when we ate it a few hours later. I have to say, this Valentine's Day dinner was the best dining experience I've had at Sole Sapori yet. The food was incredible and so was the service. I hope this is an indicator of how my future experiences will be, because I'm genuinely looking forward to coming back soon. If it goes well, I'd be inclined to bump them up from my original 2.5 star rating to a 5 star one."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food they didn't have. They didn't have the appetizer we wanted. They didn't have one of the entrees and worst of all they ran out of iced tea. That has never happened to me before.  The stuffed crust pizza was no where close to Chicago. Marinara sauce too watery and sweet. We ordered desert but it took so long we had to cancel it   Won't go back."}
{"text":"We had a party of 4. We showed up early before the other couple to enjoy each others company. They sat us at the table and took our drink orders and we requested an appetizer before the other couple arrived. We planned on enjoying it with the other couple. They waited which was nice. The other couple arrived and they took there drink orders and about 5 minutes later took our entree orders.   We were delivered salads with our entree's. The bowls were tiny, The greens were fresh but they lacked any real vegetables besides lettuce, I found one tomato, and a few carrot shreds. The sauce was Italian and it had a nice pop to it. We then received out entrees. I order Lasagna with Meat Sauce. I felt as though the Lasagna was something out of a box they bought from Sams Club. It just didn't taste homemade to me. The bread we ordered for an appetizer was delicious but the entrees were to pricey for the taste. The lasagna was about $14, in reality it should have been $9-$11 for that serving. I would go back if they adjuster there prices and offered a more homemade taste."}
{"text":"My family (a one and four year old and husband) went to Sole Sapori for dinner tonight.  Overall, it was a good meal.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan, and my husband had the meat lasagna.  We are typically fairly picky when it comes to Italian food, and we thought the food was great.  Probably the best tomato sauce I've had in Madison; the eggplant was good but not great.    The food comes with a somewhat strange, but good caraway cheese bread.  Kind of interesting, but not something I'd eat every time.  From the kids' menu, my son ordered a cheese pizza.  It was good, but not great.  If you're in the mood for pizza, try Great Scott's (traditional, fast-food-type pizza) or The Naked Elm in Blue Mounts for an eclectic, Mediterranean-style pizza.  But for pasta, Sole Sapori is quite good.  They also had a decent-looking array of warm winter drinks, but we didn't order any.  The salad was OK.  The greens themselves were good, with an OK mix of other veggies, but the dressing somewhat lacking.  They only make one dressing in-house, and I felt it was heavy on the olive oil, low on the flavor.  I gave it four stars because while all the food was good and some was great, I felt it was also overpriced.  Many of the pasta dishes were over $15, which seems like a lot for a small family restaurant.  It's a good place to go for a treat, but not a place I would frequent often."}
{"text":"Decent food, the kids love the spaghetti but that is because the sauce is so sweet; perhaps too sweet for most adults.  The pizza is excellent, stay away from the pasta dishes except for the kids."}
{"text":"Just visited again on a family members birthday choice...tried to go in with an open mind.  It's February in Wisconsin and the dining room was no more than 58 degrees.  Apparently the fireplace'a pilot light went out so we froze through our dinner.  Service was again horrible, the worst we've had.  I understand a group of 10 is a large table but on a Saturday night there were only 5 other diners in the restaurant (should be a hint) and it was 20 minutes between the first entree being served and the last!!!!  Getting separate checks was a logistical nightmare to boot.  Food was again edible at best.  SKIP THIS PLACE and go to the Bistro down the street!!!"}
