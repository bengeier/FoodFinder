{"text":"A little less expensive but very little selection and EVERYTHING is cold and or over.  They did bring out fresh orange chicken as I was leaving"}
{"text":"This place is so gross iv seen the older Chinese guy out stiring the food then he scratched his behind then kept touching the food a little gross if I'd say!! I asked for my money back but they refused to return it never again will I go there"}
{"text":"It has been over a year ago (maybe two years ago) since I visited this place. I happen to be in this shopping center & hungry, so I stop in here. It is about 3PM. The place was relatively empty - as expected of a typical restaurant.

There were several tables with empty dishes, one Mexican lady clearing and wiping the tables. I raise my hand  for a glass of water - she quickly went and got me a glass ice water then goes right back to cleaning.

The water tasted mucky - tasted like moldy water. They definitely need to filter their water.

The place is smelly. It needed major cleaning - big time. I am  surprise not more reviewers mention this - very noticeable.

I stay with the salad bar food which is pretty good. I took a small sample of other foods - it was ok; bland but ok.

It is hard for me to imagine how anyone can give this place more than a one star. I don't think I will be back until next owner."}
{"text":"I spent over a hundred dollars at this place taking my family out for dinner, biggest mistake ever. The food was as if they were serving the food they prepared the previous day. The sweet and sour chicken was so hard I couldn't even poke my fork through it. My kids are not picky eaters and they wouldn't even touch what was on their plate. The best thing at this place is the desert which was store bought."}
{"text":"Im gonna start by saying that this place doesn't even deserve a star but the lowest you can go is one star so I guess I have to but the food was bland,  the drinks seemed watered down to save money service was horrible, and there was mold beside our booth and under the table and along the wall. When I asked for my money back they basically yelled at us and tried to only give me half my money back until I showed them where it was and they pretended not to see anything and gave me all my money back after I showed them and I left but I warn everyone not to go there"}
{"text":"I was left speechless today... this is a VERY rare occurence. I have tried several chinese buffets in glendale and central phx that left me feeling 'whatever' or worse. I drove by this place a few times and it didnt look bad from outside. WOW... I was wrong. The best part is at the end!!!

Lets start with service.
The Spikey haired young guy working/texting behind the register was very apathetic when I asked how he was doing.. he mumbled something i didnt understand and handed me back my stapled receipt for two ( 20 bucks total) He just seemed very rude...not welcoming at all.

Atmosphere... standard chinese buffet furniture.. whatever... the televisions were BLASTING spanish tv.... so annoying.

Food...would have been mediocre if it was fresh.. it had been sitting out 4 hours... I spit out several things i tried and after getting down a few things.... we get to the most interesting part...
I feel sick...
I want to get this slop out of me before I get full blown poisoning...
So I get up to go to the bathroom...

Which SUPRISE!!! is inhabited by a 9 year old boy taking a dump with the stall door wide open and his two year old brother is NAKED!!!!! unravelling the TP roll beside him!!! WTF!?? seriously?? I go into the other stall to hurl and cannot even bring myself near the toilet...It was horrifying....yes teh bathroom was too gross to puke in!

 I reach out and grab the waste can ... feeling a bit better AND worse for what I have witnessed... I go back to my table and ask my friend to go to the restroom and confirm what I just saw... she comes back laughing...and about 30 seconds later out runs the naked toddler... YES THROUGH THE DININGROOM. The couple had to have like 7 kids...
We burst out laughing and ran out of the building.. so freaking SURREAL.
I am taking no artistic license here... Thems the facts.
We keep asking each other if that REALLY happened.
 
Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. You know it's nothing special when no one working there is of the ethnicity the food is meant to be. It was a confusing experience. The food was nothing to write home about. Being from Reno, NV, I've experienced some awesome buffets in my time. This is not one of them. I'm sad that I wasn't impressed by this place, since it's within walking distance of my house."}
{"text":"Went here today with Rand H.for there lunch time buffet. The food here was your typical Chinese fare and was alright nothing i ate was terrible and at the same token nothing was outstanding. They have good polish sausage and I liked the corn on the cob with a tray of melted butter on the side.There crispy chicken wings were also very good. Drinks are included with the buffet which makes this a very reasonable lunch buffet and ok if your in the area."}
{"text":"I just wanted to chime in. I've had this place a few times just to check to see if it has improved any. Trust me, the food is just terrible. When you walk in, you are slammed with the smell of seafood- the taste is even in the food. I think they believe that it's good that the whole place smells like a fish market. 

How can Red Lobster smell less fishy than this place? The rice is dry, tastes like fish, and doesn't have any flavor. The best item on the menu is the jalapeno potatoes, which aren't even oriental.

 The to go cups are very small, and you can't get any other size.  People consistently use the tongs & large spoons, then set the handle (which they just touched) directly onto the food, which isn't heated enough to kill any germs.  I don't think it is unsafe, just really terrible. Please avoid this place, they don't deserve to stay open."}
{"text":"I went here because we were in the neighborhood. The experience was horrible from the moment I paid and looked at the buffet. While there was plenty of parking (which I now understand why), their selection was dismal. I should probably start with the fact that they didn't have any of the typical staples of a Chinese buffet. No Kung Pao, no beef and broccoli, hell no beef at all. They had cold entrees of chicken and seafood The seafood wouldn't even be usable as fishing bait. For desert I got some of the chocolate pudding which came with a couple surprises. The first spoon full had a carrot in it. The carrot was surprising because none of their items had carrots in them. I continued to spoon through the \"pudding\" and found a jalapeno and a peanut. This place is horrible, if you are stranded in the area and starving you would be better satiated feasting from the dumpster behind the Burger King. The cost of this was over what you would expect to pay from a decent Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"The other half and I settled on this place the other nite b/c we couldn't find the other Chinese buffet we were searching for.  After about an hour's drive, we looped back toward CenPho and pulled in here instead.  I had a bit of trepidation but you know I love me some ghetto Chinese buffet.  We'll, that's exactly what I got.

The selection was pretty good but there were only about 10 things I ventured to try. The fried rice was skank; bland, tasteless and mealy. The \"lo mein\" was actually the best thing on the buffet.  The chicken dishes were ok.  The pork spareribs were disgusting; mushy candy-red chunks of bone with hardly any meat, swimming in a gelatinous sea of sauce that tasted of only 1 thing I can compare the flavor to -- pink urinal cakes.  There was some nasty looking fried fish remains left dying on the buffet (the skin had been crackling under the lights for hours) and some assorted old food.  No egg rolls. Nasty dried out rangoon. The tables were sticky (which grosses me out completely) and the bathrooms were actually better than I expected given the rest of the place.

I think if we'd come earlier the offerings may have been more appealing.  We hit the place around 8:30 on a Saturday nite and they closed at 10, so they weren't refilling the tables much. Such is life in buffettown.

On a positive note, the fountain Coke was the best I've tasted in years -- perfect balance of sweet Cokey syrup and enough carbonation to not seem flat.

I doubt I'd go in again, although the register receipt did crack us up.  At the top it reads, \"Great Dragon Buffet presents the THANK YOU\". 

Well, thank you GDB!"}
{"text":"Mid-sized dining area. Prices ok, to-go orders charged by weight. Smells like fish (in a bad way, just to be clear), but looks clean. Food was nothing special, but not bad. Staff was... not there? Loud elevator-type music, and two tvs with Spanish soap-operas on. Not going here again."}
{"text":"Well after reading the reviews I wanted to run but I thought check it out being a traveler I eating at a bunch of joke buffet's this one is good I got there at 2 pm thought im screwed I'll just check it took a look wow tons of food and all hot, good favor do yourself right go here , this place is good i will be back"}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate fate of eating at this buffet because of family but this place simply IS NOT GOOD. Anyone who eats food should know that these buffets are absolutely the worst. The food is bought frozen, over cooked and terribly presented. There is no way that I'd ever go to another one of these buffets. 

Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"Eaten at  many buffet Chinese in the area. I thought the food was actually very good. Despite all the bad reviews. Worth checking out for sure. Nice selection! I definitely would be back there wonton soup is the bomb:)"}
{"text":"Stoned or drunk? I got the Chinese buffet for you.

It's not the most appealing but it gets the job done.

Staff is cool, pretty nice and friendly each time."}
{"text":"Well, I'm hungry so I ate it... Terrible Chinese food.   Sorry...   Some of it was probably cooked today."}
{"text":"Do. Not. Go. Everrrrer. Food is terrible. If I could give less than 1 star I would. I pray I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"WOW! So we thought ok, it can't possibly be that bad. We'll, we were horribly wrong in every way. We do not have high standards when it comes to food. My husband paid 27$ and we got our plates. The cook was walking around eating the food, so we thought, hey probably won't get sick. Small selection but ok, not a big deal. We each picked a few things that are common among Chinese buffets, figured they were safe. We were wrong again! The sweet and sour chicken  tasted like pickles and I didn't even have sauce on it, the pork on a stick was jerky but the flavor wasn't awful. My husband and I each took a few bites and realized that this place wasn't worth dying over and forfeited our 27$. We have NEVER left an all you can eat buffet without at least being full. But leaving was the best choice we've made."}
