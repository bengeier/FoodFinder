{"text":"I've never actually been to the establishment itself, I've only ordered take out, but their jerk chicken is AMAZING. Unlike most other places in Toronto, they actually smoke it, so it gives it this extra layer of flavour that's just incredible."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot!   Pulled in for a beer and spent the entire evening.   We weren't hungry on arrival, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic.  Ended up having Jamaican jerk chicken nachos.  We will be back to explore the rest if the menu."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly. Drinks are reasonably priced. A ton of ppl came for take out while I sat at the bar. Not much of a crowd in the bar for a Friday night but the fact so many came for food let's me know it's good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place the other day and the food was amazing !! Tried the chicken roti, oxtail and curry goat and everything was really good."}
{"text":"Don't even live in this area but I go to this bar every time! Great loud music on the weekends especially. Ps the nachos and the rotis are to die for if you're looking for something to munch on with your drink. Highly recommend this bar."}
