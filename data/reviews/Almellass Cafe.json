{"text":"Too bad, I was waiting for 25 minutes after I made order, after 25 minutes  the girl came and said sorry we didn't have mansef today!!

I won't go to this restaurant any more"}
{"text":"This is the first Saudi food restaurant I've encountered in the US. Having lived in Saudi for a good portion of my life I was happy to see a lot of menu items I've only seen inside the Kingdom. I ordered the lamb kabsa, chicken kabsa, lamb margoog, okra stew, and fried fish. Unfortunately, one of the items I wanted (the saleeg), wasn't available. But the food was good and the host friendly. You won't find lamb like this many places. Check it out."}
{"text":"Though the place wad not so organized, the food is exceptionally fresh, delicious and the meat is perfectly cooked. Add to that the very kind waiter."}
{"text":"I just Love it! The Owner/Chef is humble and professional.  He welcomed us at the door and was very excited serving us a delicious bite.  It looks like its a new business but felt very comfortable and hommie because of all the mediterranean traditional decorations.

Don't expect a Five star restaurant, but definitely expect  a five star tasty mediterranean meal. 

I will definitely be back. 

Rob."}
{"text":"This place is specifically designed for Saudis, so if you want the complete experience then you should go to it. The walls are covered with Saudi proverbs. They also have interesting objects that you can see and ask about.

And for the most important thing, the food. It is good and comes in descent proportions. One thing to note that they make the food in batches so your order could take some time until it is ready. 

Finally, they don't have a fixed menu. Call ahead to see what do they have and when are they making it."}
{"text":"I have really been wanting to try new flavor from around the world, and I am so thankful I found this place! I have never had Saudi cuisine, and I'm glad I finally did. I ordered the Lamb Kabsa and it was so delicious!!!! The lamb was super tender and the basmati rice was seasoned perfectly. The sauces that came with it were amazing too!!! I ordered a side of tzatziki which was probably the best I have ever had. The rice pudding is really good too!!!! I will definitely be ordering from here again! The delivery service took a little longer than expected, but it was so worth the wait. (:"}
{"text":"They turned me away because I do not speak Arabic. They said no menu. So...it smelled delicious but I guess I'll never know. You should have menus and someone who speaks English, no?"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Good food and good service! Try their hibiscus tea and Kabsa! This restaurant is a little hard to find because they do not have a sign, but it is worth it. :D"}
