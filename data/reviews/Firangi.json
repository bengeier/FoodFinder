{"text":"** this review is from my 10 year old son**

When I came to the restaurant, I smelled food right away and when I sat down at my table and ordered the food, I was blown away it was like love at first bite!

And...Aishwarya is the best server - she is so nice and efficient!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and incredible food. I haven't had such a great and unique dining experience in Toronto till now. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible experience overall.  My first time writing a Yelp review and unfortunately it is a negative one! First, I had made a reservation which was nowhere to be found/not written down when we got there. Then they put us in a separate dining room, seemingly segregated from all the other customers who had real tables, while we were more in the bar/pub section of the restaurant. Then we were told the machines weren't working so they would only be taking cash tonight (?). Service was very spotty; yes they checked on us frequently, but the dishware was dirty and the servers kept asking us elementary questions - should they bring out the mains (um yes), did we want new cutlery for them (yes), would that include a fork (uh, yes?!), etc.  The servers kept switching around and asked us the same questions also.  The food was also subpar and expensive compared to the plethora of Indian restaurants in Brampton - the chaat was stale and soggy for example, the papadums were uncooked; the mains were fine and the bread was decent but neither were enough to make us want to go back. I would not recommend.  The server(s) did ask if we wanted dessert but unfortunately by then we just wanted to leave - we paid our bill (with tip!) and left to get dessert elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went there for Lunch. Presentation and tiffin options can be improved. Attendants weren't attentive, you've to waive them although dining room was almost empty. Chicken curry and yellow dal was good in taste but mushroom curry was just a pass. Faluda Kulfi was good."}
{"text":"Good decor 
Over priced 
Tasteless food 
subpar service
tbh as an indian the food is not authentic."}
{"text":"First time here tonight, loved it.
Our server, Sim, was extremely helpful as we didn't know what to order. She took the time to explain what the dishes were and to make suggestions.  We had Nurani Kebab and Chicken Tikka, followed by Ambala Wali Chicken, Rajasthani Lal Maas and Jeera Pilau. Everything was exceptional, really tender and tasted amazing. The ambiance was lovely, staff were inviting and friendly. Would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Good food.... tried out few things on the menu
Laal Maas- not authentic but good taste 
Kerela Fish- good 
Ambala Chicken- good 
Keema--- very good 
Rumali Roti- stale
appetizers were great"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and I was glad I did. I wasn't too sure initially because of the stars on Yelp but it was worth the trip. 

The restaurant looks great inside. It's got this modern yet rustic Indian decor with furniture that matches the theme. However, Eric Clapton playing in the background didn't quite fit the theme but other than that, they did a great job. When you walk in, you can see the open kitchen as well along with original art from @hatecopy. 

We ordered chicken and lamb Tiffin. It was presented well in these metal brass looking containers. Food tasted great. We ordered a fresh lime soda as well that was refreshing. 

Overall the experience was great. I wish they had restaurants like this where I live."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype around this place so I thought I would take my mom here for her birthday to check it out. The decor is very modern looking for an Indian restaurant and the presentation of the food is 5 stars; however, it is not worth the price. The food is mediocre at best. We ordered a few appetizers including fish pakoras and chicken 65 (the lone bright spot); the entrees were interesting (kofta, ambala chicken and daal) but failed to hit the spot for the most part. If you feel like going to an Indian restaurant just to take pictures for your Instagram then it is worth it...otherwise there are plenty other better, cheaper and more authentic options in Brampton."}
{"text":"What an exceptional meal.  We ordered a variety of plates from both the Small and Big entrees on the dinner menu.  

Positives:  
- Some original dishes.
- Some of the food was quite spicy (in a good way!)
- Great decor, good music at the right volume.
- Nice large table for a family of 8.
- Generally good service.

Negatives:
- Portion sizes a bit on the small side considering the per entree price.
- Server didn't understand family style dining and brought out each tiny plate 1 by 1 for a table of 8.  It honestly looks really stupid to put down a tiny dish with 3 pieces in the middle of a table of 8 people when they have ordered a variety of appetizers.
- Server DID NOT inform me that the gratuity was included (17%).  While I have no issue with this practice, it's important to INFORM the customer.  If he had, I would have left another tip on top of that.

Will be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place
The ambiance very well done. 
I went to firungi for a friends birthday party. 
The food was just excellent and beautifully presented. We had the butter chicken fries( my fav of the night) and chaat for appetizers. 10/10
For dinner we ordered the daal, chicken 65, chicken karhai, and paneer saag 10/10

Also ordered sweet lassi was too thick and they wouldn't serve it a light bulb like the other drinks."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, specially the presentation. It's an extremely unique place that manages to provide great levels of satisfaction to their customers. The quality of the food is remarkable, specially the quality of shrimp. I am usually very restricted in terms of sea food but the shrimps here were great. Likewise, the food is appropriately priced and you are paying for quality. Lastly, the ambience of the place was great. Me and my friends sat in the lounge area and enjoyed the amazing food and drinks. It is an exceptional concept and I've never had such a dining experience in Toronto. It caters to the needs of all age groups."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great! I always worry when restaurants try to fusion up Indian food.. Usually it just turns out bland and weird. But Firangi has figured out a great balance. Most of these appetizers ate fusion.. But curries and mains look and taste super authentic. The ambience is probably the best part. Finally you can dress up go out to celebrate something with  Indian food that's not in a dingy unattractive restaurant. Service was good as well. A little off here and there with the water and plates but overall the evening went smooth. 

And omg. That rasmalai tiramisu looked like a piece of heaven. Too bad I'm on no sugar diet right now but I'm so going to go back for that!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant nice atmosphere. I bought the lamb biryani i have to say it tasted good the only negative thing i will say. The portion was very small i got three pieces of lamb."}
{"text":"This is a hard one. I normally rate things more positively, but I had such a strange experience at Firangi! First, let me say one thing: the food is fantastic. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Food alone would be four or five stars. But the service was schizophrenic! It was never one particular server, which is OK, but they didn't seem to communicate with each other. One guy was coming by every other bite of food, another would say she'd get us something then disappear, another guy was overheard saying that it wasn't his job to get someone some water. 

Then, when it was time to pay, we said we needed a moment to discuss the cheque, and -- no exaggeration--she came back 20 seconds later. I said again that we needed a few minutes and said she could check back in about five minutes. Less than a minute later, she was back. I was a bit short this time when I said we needed time to talk and we would be faster if we could just figure it out without interruption. She then sent someone else over. About 30 seconds later. I was so annoyed! Even if you're trying to turn the table, let someone THINK for goodness sake! Especially after being asked. 

Firangi has the food down. Great job on that. But get the service aspect together, please, owners. You have a good thing. Don't let poor service be your downfall."}
{"text":"Thought we'd grab a quick bite to eat before heading over to the movie theatre and boy, we didn't want to leave! 
Their version of \"chaat\", a south Asian street food staple, did not sound appetizing in the description on the menu but when it came, it was delicious! We also ordered their Pao Bhaji which came with yummiest buns! The paratas look more like naan but both plain and the onion chilli paratas were perfect with their chai. 
The restaurant is millennial style trendy, with funky artwork and an interesting bar. The service was quick and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in helping us choose our food. When we didn't like the kind of chai she brought, she was quick to offer to make another batch of chai more to our liking. 
It is quite out of my way but I will definitely be going back to try more things on the menu. 
Oh and it's halal :)"}
{"text":"We went to this spot when it first started! Really nice atmosphere and the food is great too. We had the lamp chops for appetizers and the chicken momos. We really enjoyed this spot! It is a nice Indian restaurant with great customer service. It is a little bit on the high end price range for Indian cuisine. For a family of three we spent approx $150 including food and drinks. Definitely worth a trying this place out!"}
{"text":"The Indian food scene in Toronto is changing rapidly for the better. Everyone has their own tastes but Firangi is probably my most favourite Indian restaurant in the GTA. It's trendy, casual and great ambience.

Food is impeccable 
Service is impeccable 
Selection of spirits in impeccable 

Food you must try: my top picks

- lamb sliders
- Amritsari fish 
- Lamb Chops 

- ambala chicken curry
- daal makhani 
- lal Maas (more like goat curry and not really all Maas but it's very tasty

Desert selection is ok - I think would need some more selections.

Try the Japanese single malt - Hibikki - fantastic!

Great place, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Firangi is the brainchild of Chef Sanjeev Sethi who is also the Chef & Owner of 'The Host Fine Indian Cuisine' near Square One. Just like his previous restaurant this is also as mediocre and over hyped by décor and hiked up prices for his \"prized\" dishes. We were greeted by the host in front with dirty shoes and were seated at a table with apparently most uncomfortable small chairs that would be for small children. This is mostly due to the owner trying to squeeze in as much as covers as possible in the provided space.
Now the Menu. You shall find items such as \"Butter Chicken Fries, chicken tikka taco's, Kingfisher Beer Battered Fish Amratsari\"; these are the dishes of a newbie cook trying to fuse Indian food with other cuisines thinking that they have created something amazing (hint hint, this is what you do with leftover food at home or find it at a carnival). 
We ordered 
Hare Patey Ki Tokri Chaat : I could taste the bitterness of the old cooking oil in the overfried potato baskets. 
Nurani Kebab: Chicken Mince with spices wrapped around Lamb Mince served in Shot glasses with basic green chutney underneath. Completely destroyed due to excess chilli's & spices.
Lamb Chops: a 20 year old recipe. I will admit these were half decent and I wanted more than just 4 piece for the price of $25 for this app. But considering the caliber of what they proclaim to be these could have been made by any good chef or a house cook with basic skills and they would turn out as good.
Harey Bhare Kebab: Vegetarian classic that is supposed to be mild yet but they overkilled it with chilli's and sprinkled what I figured was minuscule amount of goat cheese on top (our server nor denied or confirmed this when inquired) 
Rajasthani Lal Mass: quite ticked off with this one actually. This was recommended by our server. It was suppose to be a beautiful Mutton dish of Rajasthan yet what I was given was your basic Bone in Goat curry with some Lal mirch spice. Meat itself was not as fresh and clear water kept separating from the gravy 
Ambala wala Chicken curry: Just your basic Chicken Curry with boneless chicken. Let me remind you that putting a famous Indian states name in front of your menu item doesn't make it special plus no history was given to backup the name of it. Also the water kept separating from the gravy as well with this one.

Pukhtani Kofta : Beetroot covered Paneer in your standard cashew cream gravy. The kofta itself was good but the beetroot was being spoiled by the gravy which to be honest was more of your standard butter chicken or a paneer gravy. Sometimes its best not to force combine things that don't go together.

Clocking in at over $180 for all this with a bowl of rice and 3 naan's makes me wonder if by reading this review chef Sanjeev will change his course and actually make it worth while to charge these prices and serve up some real good food. Also with a name like Firangi I would have expected a British Inspired Décor and menu."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and great food . The quantity is little on the lower side but the food tastes good."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We tried all their veg appetizers and each one was unique and mouth watering. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience, great appetizers, good drinks, but average main course. The place is very balanced in terms of decore. The chat was delicious, and kababs were very well presented. However, I felt they didn't do justice with their main course. Chicken curry was ordinary. 
I heard about their lunch dabba, so will try that once. Hoping it will fullfil my expectations and I could give them additional stars ."}
{"text":"Super slow service for take out... i ordered today veggie biriyani, paneer sabji and rotis. When i open the box of biriyani i found chicken pieces... such a big disappointment. Such a carelessness of restaurant!!! I will not recommend to anyone who wants to eat vegetarian food there. Do not go they will feed you chicken!!!"}

{"text":"Good food, dint like the tandoori shrimp thou. It was uncooked.Loved the ambiance and presentation of food."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, you'll notice that the decor in the main dining area is top notch. Nice brown and gold colour palette and interesting furniture. Their open kitchen at the back provides both entertainment and makes the restaurant appear bigger than it is.

Unfortunately, we didn't get to sit in this room. On a weekday lunch, we were seated in the secondary dining room. The decor still followed the theme of the restaurant, but it appeared to have used a disproportionately smaller amount of the interior decor budget. Our primary complaint was that the chairs looked nice, but weren't comfortable to sit on. The backrest in their booths formed an acute angle, making leaning back awkward.

We spent a couple minutes viewing the menu with our server attentively answering any questions we had. We were particularly curious about their tiffins, which we were told were sorta like lunchboxes that were stacked container on container and brought to work for lunch. I ended up ordering their lamb tiffin. At $16, it came with a container of lamb curry, basmati rice, dal, and a pea and potato curry. It also came with an order of naan. We were given a basket of papadum to eat while we waited for our orders to arrive.

The food came in a reasonable amount of time. It was definitely a complete meal. the tiffin was about a foot tall, and once I emptied out its contents onto my plate, the food stacked at least a couple inches high. The naan was fresh and tasty. The three curries provided variety and there was a decent amount of lamb included. The meat was tender and cooked well.

I was satisfied with my meal, and the service was attentive with not many complaints. My only recommendation is to have a more robust communication system between servers. At least 3 different waiters came by asking us if we wanted our bill at the end of our meal. 

Other than that, my first visit to Firangi was quite pleasant. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty pricy for the quantity of food. Ordered 'Nurani kabob' and got 4 little pieces of kabob. I usually go to Nirvana in Mississauga which is great...high price but very good quality and quantity. Did not appreciate the service. Waiter kept recommending additional items when there was no need as we had already decided the food items we wanted to order. 

It was a good trial but will not go back. Fix the high prices or fix the quantity of food !"}
{"text":"Good food. Good environment. Decent service. I checked in on yelp and was to get the first appetizer 1/2 half but was denied. They said this offer was only during the first month. Bit of a bummer but overall good experience."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. Sometimes quite good other times quite poor. The butter chicken and roomali roti are wonderful. Otherwise everything else was quite bad."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  

I like the essence of Indian cuisine but some of the super-authentic dishes are a bit much for me.   This place just takes the edge off too-traditional Indian food and freshens it up with some subtle differences.  I had the Badami Tikka almond chicken dish and some naan bread.  Was awesome!"}
{"text":"Among the numerous restaurants in GTA area, this one tries to be a  different. The ambience is really nice - it's one of the best in the city. The bartender can suggest some creative drinks and the severs want to have a conversation with you and get to know you. There's limited items on the menu out there - which I thought was good. You should visit this place for appetizers and drinks. The appetizers are \"heavy\" and fill you up - you won't have a need to offer a main course. The restaurant likes to add some style to the restaurant - the servers wear black gloves which I thought was nice! Overall, a place where I'd want to visit when I want to enjoy my drink and some delicious appetizers and have a conversation with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Service sucked.  Food was ok. The server had no clue what she was doing.  We were sitting for 30 mins before we even got water to drink. 

When the bill came, then she wanted to be friendly and ask us how the food was.

Please.  We didn't tip her.  The service is what will make this place go down"}
{"text":"Came here during the holiday season. Place was quite busy. We got a table for two near the entrance. Here's the problem. Don't like sitting on a stool for dinner! Quite uncomfortable. Not suitable for entertaining for business.

Food was middling to good. Did not wow us. Price seemed a tad bit on the high side. Overall did not find the place compelling."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends party. Had a great time and atmosphere. Place is huge and spacious and lots of servers to constantly serve you. Great food too!"}
{"text":"Too noisy, food is ok, not that great. Very expensive and low quantity. Not recommended. Many better Indian Restaurants available in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Don't go there. Looks nice on the outside, dirty on the inside.  Walked passed the back, very disorganized restaurant! Makes me question about the food and drinks they served!"}
{"text":"Tried firangi on a recommendation from a friend. Drove from Oakville and was sceptical about about another Brampton Indian restaurant. Upon arrival the staff seemed very accommodating about where to seat us as we where 4 adults and 4 kids. Service started out okay but you can tell the staff is in experienced and not properly trained. Food was very good, but then we had a turn near the end of the meal and big piece of hair was found and you could see it was cooked into the curry. We advised our waiter who was very apologetic and offered Ilya free desert . It was a shame as we ordered extra to take left overs home . They offered us free desert and we said okay but I also asked that the potential 2 dishes that had the hair be removed from the bill as no one wanted to take any of the 4 dishes home that remained . The waiter agreed and asked us if we still wanted desert , And brought us 3 . We thought that was a fair remedy to the issue. When the bill arrived the desert where charged for . When we questioned it he said that since they took off 2 items the owner had to charge for deserts . Initially we could have raised a bigger issue but did not want to ruin our dinner out with friends. The service was below average and made the entire experience disappointing."}
{"text":"Was here last month. I chose this location as it was by host. It was Indian fusion food and usually other places don't do justice with fusion food. Tandoori chicken was amazing, had good favours. We ordered curry chicken by mistake and the server brought it to us but then I realized I wanted butter chicken. I know it was my mistake but I didn't touch the curry she brought to our table and asked if she could change. She just asked us not to touch it and she will confirm. She came back to our table within 2-3 mins and said she will replace it with butter chicken. Servers were coming to our table every 10-15 mins to ask if everything was ok and if we needed something. I know it was little more pricey than other places but with the quality of service I got, I don't mind the price."}
{"text":"This place is pretty fancy compared to the other Indian restaurants I've been to in Brampton. That being said, the prices are pretty steep for Indian food and the portions can be fairly stingy. I think it's still worth coming here for the quality of food you're getting. 

Hits:
- Garlic naan: Their naan is out of this world! Definitely the best I've ever had, they're basically the reason I come to this restaurant. 
- Ambala Wala Chicken curry: Definitely my go to dish here. It's delicious and the chicken is so tender. The portion seems small at first, but if you pair this dish with a naan it can fill you up. 

Misses:
- Lamb chops: Very flavourful, but not sure if I'd pay $25 for the small portion size."}
{"text":"What a cool spot this is!
While in town recently, the family had dinner here one evening. I loved the ambiance and was very pleased with the friendly service. the cocktails were good (i was a fan of the tamarind & tequila one), and the food was delicious & well presented. so many good options on the menu, that we had to go with a meat platter appetizer. everything from the lamb chops to the tandoori chicken was good. some dishes were on the saltier side, but nothing that couldn't be toned down with a bite of the hot butter naan. others on the table tried everything from the cauliflower to the jackfruit and biryani.. i heard no complaints!
the desserts though unique sounding, tasted not so unique - the gajar halwa cheesecake for instance, tasted like good ol cheesecake, and not so much like gajar halwa. the faluda and kulfis were as expected :) 
While our experience was mostly good, the only negatives were probably that the dining room got real smoky from all the tandoori dishes being ordered, and we walked out smelling like indian food - though to be fair, that's usually impossible to avoid if you're going to eat at an Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"My family ( including a 2 year old toddler) came to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our overall experience was fine- nothing super special. 
Service/ ambience- good
Food quality- fair
Price- $$$ (7 people and we paid $300)

Apps were better than dinner we ordered. We ordered veg and non-veg, meat dishes were apparently better tasting ( i am vegetarian). Dessert was a big disappointment though ( Falooda in a flat plate and we were given forks!!!). 

Lastly, neither men or women bathroom had a changing table and that's a big inconvenience as kids can be unpredictable. I would think twice before heading back to this place as this is a deal-breaker for us( people with kids might understand this better!)."}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing service. This is our second time back at Firangi's within two weeks and our waiter, Sarik, has been super friendly and has great recommendations. The food is served in a unique fashion and this place is a definite must-try."}
