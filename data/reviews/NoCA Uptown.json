{"text":"Brought my friends birthday here and had a blast! The food was next level and the service second to none! Can't wait for the nightclub portion to open and to spend more time and money here! Cheers to my man Slater!"}
{"text":"Warning this is a long and bad review of recent experience at the Labor day weekend nightclub opening of NoCa.  My friend reserved VIP table service with one premium bottle included for $345 through eventbrite. We arrived just before midnight and didn't have to wait in the long line because we showed our table reservation to the bouncer. Once inside, the table service hostess told us that one person needed to be seated before us then we were next so we could wait at the bar.  After 30ish minutes of waiting, we went to locate the hostess who didn't remember all the details of our reservation but told us that she was working on finding a table for us. Another 15 minutes passed before she told us that people were seated at our table that had not paid and she didn't know this which caused a delay. She then brought us to our table.  This table was a long dining room type table with barstools right near the entrance that was not in the main club area nor was it designated as reserved in any way. The 10 chairs at our table were partially occupied by other people so we asked if this was actually a VIP table and if so why was it not designated as such. She told us that all other tables in the main club area were for people who paid for 2 or 3 bottles and if we wanted those we would have to pay an additional $600. We asked why our table was so far from the club area and she told us that all the one bottle tables were seated in this area which was odd since no other people at this table had paid for bottle service. She told us she would be right back and left around us 12:45am. While waiting, we met a group of 4 guys who had reserved a table as we did, had been seated at a table but had never received the bottle of alcohol they ordered. The hostess returned and both of these groups asked for a refund which she said she would do. For the next hour, we got the run around from this hostess, management, the owner and various other employees. Everyone listened to our issues and told us they would have to talk to management then did not return. During this time we met another person who had the same issues, he had gotten his table and never got the bottle he ordered.  Finally around 1:40am, the owner came down and gave all parties a cash refund. In this final interaction the hostess asked for photos of our ID so that the next time we came she would comp us a bottle to which we declined.  My friend and I have traveled locally and internationally and usually always reserve a table for ease of entry. We have never had this type of experience before and will not be returning to NoCa because of this. Thus evening was ruined because bars in Charlotte close at 2am so there was no time to get to another club to get a drink.  If I could give no stars for this place I would. It is sad that on opening night they could not be organized enough to get us a table in a reasonable about of time nor could they act professionally after realizing they had oversold tables and could not provide services that were paid for. I highly recommend to avoid this place for evening events until customer service has made significant improvements."}

{"text":"My friend and I decided to come and try Noca tonight just to get out and have a drink. Upon entrance  inside the establishment I was excited because I love new night spots in Charlotte. My friend and I walked in and sat at the bar waiting to be serviced. It was toward the end of the night and the bar really wasn't that busy or full. We tried flagging down the Asian female bartender as well as the two male bartenders working tonight. The female bartender looked very unbothered as if she was just behind the bar to be there, not to work. We sat at the bar for a good 20 Minutes trying to be patient, however the lack service and attentiveness resulted in our departure. It is really sad that the service in this establishment was so poor. As follow member of the hospitality industry I feel bad service is a representation of the establishment as a whole. I'm disappointed that I will not be bad, however a few words of advice would be to train employees on proper service as well as customer service."}
{"text":"Low key night uptown. Stopped into the local new restaurant. The decor consisted of various artwork scattered throughout the restaurant with nice accents. We were immediately seated at our table.  Hubby ordered lemon peppered wings, well seasoned not overwhelming. I tried the grass fed burger with the fries. The burger was good and fresh but could have used more seasoning. Overall good experience, food ranged from 15-30 pp."}
{"text":"The food is amazing--the chef does an amazing job of marrying the diverse fusion flavors of southern food with a modern flair. I was very disappointed that although the website advertises a lavish drink menu, when I asked for said cocktail--I was told they don't have designated cocktails. Overall, great food, but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"First things first...an uptown place with abundant parking right in front is GREAT. A sign in front messaged that parking is validated, but the lot was prepay, so I'm not sure how that is supposed to work. It was only $5 though, so no big deal.  We attended a craft cocktail making event upstairs. Beautiful decor, including the artwork and lighting. Downstairs the bar selections were somewhat limited, but I assume will expand with time.  All the staff was extremely personable and warm - made me feel like they actually value their guests. The food pairings we had with our cocktails were well prepared - Asian inspired vegetable lettuce wraps, Satay-type chicken skewers that were not overcooked like most places put out.  I look forward to coming back to try out a few.more things. Good job, and best of luck!"}
{"text":"Noca Uptown is very posh without feeling stuffy. Diverse menu that mixes Northern California cuisine with Louisiana creole dishes. Trying the crawfish croquettes and Noca Surf and Turf for my first dish. The food is seasoned very well, served fresh, and with a classic yet welcoming twist. Definitely look forward to dining here for many special occasions to come!"}
