{"text":"After hearing some good vibes about this place online, my wife and I brought the kiddos in for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  Let me tell you all, It feels REALLY good when you make such a good decision in life.  After sitting down in one of the comfy booths, the kids went to work on the bowl of starburst on the table, which was a cute touch.  Great music was playing (Fleetwood Mac, Beatles, etc.) and we both commented on how the ambiance and decor of this cafe made us feel transported to somewhere...just...else, and in the best of ways.

After perusing the baked goods on the counter, we started with what I'd describe as a \"tropical roll\" which was appeared as a classic cinammon roll, only with banana, pineapple and strawberry.  I've never had anything like it, and every single ounce of it was consumed.  (Pretty good start, one thumb up...)

Then, we tried a breakfast sandwich and a breakfast burrito.  Both were simply delicious, especially the sandwich which came on this amazing bread baked in-house.  It had the sweetness of a brioche, but without the glossy finish.  The meat (ham and sausage, respectively) was very high quality and the veggies also fresh and delicious.  Just very, very good.  The coffee was top-notch and the water (yes the water) was from a water cooler (not the tap), which was just one of those little details that made everything better. (For those scoring at home, two thumbs are now up...)

Lastly, during the meal the owner came by the table and told our monkeys (read: kids) that she had a special treat for them if they behaved.  Of course they didn't because they're 3 and 5 and often make a strong argument to have themselves leashed while in public, but the owner certainly delivered the (baked) goods on her end!  I assumed they'd receive a small, bite-sized treat, maybe crafted from some excess dough.  I was sorely mistaken.  With a big smile, she handed each child a full-sized, warmed \"cinnamon roll on a stick\" blanketed with their amazing icing.  Not only the kids, but our faces also lit up like Christmas trees in July.  I don't usually do back flips over cinnamon rolls.  I had to apologize to the kids for eating so much of their treat.  Oh, and let it be known that I wasn't even hungry anymore after the prior food.  (Someone lend me a third thumb so I can put IT up!)

There was just a great comfort and warmth within this place, and when paired with such great food and service, it made for a very memorable dining experience.  This place really is a treasure in this town, and I can't recommend it highly enough!  Go try it out and see for yourself!  One request - save a cinnamon roll for me...you know, for the kids (wink, wink).

Thank you Taste of Grace for getting our weekend started on such a wonderful note!  We WILL be back...like, this week. :)"}
{"text":"We got some chicken salad sandwhiches, pastries, and some drinks. So good! I got a chai tea with almond milk. It was AMAZING. My daughter had a pastry and she absolutely loved it. She's become such a picky eater that I figured she wouldn't end up eating it. But it definitely got her approval! This was our first time in and we will be back!! ^_^"}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant fantastic pastries. Super friendly people love this place. Breakfast made to order period sandwiches made to order. Awesome awesome little restaurant keep up the good work"}
{"text":"The place looks really cozy and smells wonderful! It sits maybe 20-25 people. The owner is vey friendly and welcoming. The menu is confusing, she goes to the table to explain it to you. It's not clear about type of bread, optional ingredients for scrambled eggs(they call it omelette), or sides. The coffee was really good, but it takes 15 mins, so be patient. We went Saturday morning. When we arrived they had 2 tables, one finished and left about 20mins after. We stayed there for an hour and their table was never cleaned. I ordered pancakes but they prepared French Toast instead. They gave us 10% discount because of the mistake. Once the pancakes arrived they were really good! The other table also had problems with the order since we heard the server apologizing for the mistake. None of them cover their hair with a hair net or hat! Finally they brought the ticket and we handled the debit card, then the server verbally asked right there how much tip were we going to give her since she needed to enter the information in the machine.(It felt really awkward)It could be a great place for breakfast but they need to step up their game to make it!"}
{"text":"Amazing cinnamon rolls, period.  The ladies here are so sweet too.  But back to the cinnamon rolls, these should be patented. I don't know what's in the frosting but it's sooooooooo good.  I love how eclectic it is in this place too. It feels like home. It's that coffee shop you just want to go read a book in (and eat a million cinnamon rolls)."}
{"text":"I believe in supporting small, local businesses which is a huge reason why I encourage you to try Taste of Grace. It's small, not meant for large parties, but the owner is always there and she makes the food from scratch herself. We had the French toast and it was excellent. The omelettes are more like scrambled but, whatever, it was still good. I haven't had a chance to try the cinnamon roll yet but that is what this place is known for. 

The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's a little over priced for the portions (but I recognize small, local restaurants have a lot of overhead). It's also slow - luckily we weren't in a hurry, but if you're looking for a quick bite - until they hire more hands - this isn't the place for it. As it gains popularity, hopefully they can get some more help."}
{"text":"What an excellent addition to our small town! The owner is a sweetheart and the atmosphere is homey. She chats as she makes food and drinks over the counter and I immediately had a feeling of having breakfast prepared at a family members house. Plus the food is reasonably priced and fantastic! Will come again!"}
{"text":"Met some girlfriends here for lunch. I'd read on FB that it was pretty darned good, so was excited to finally be able to visit.
From the moment we entered, we were warmly welcomed and felt comfortable. The place is simply adorable. There's a couch and a TV (they had music playing at the moment). Seating was comfortable and the tables weren't on top of each other.
The make everything to order. Like literally - pretty much whatever you want, they make it. They make their own breads. They had tuna and chicken salad, deli meats, pretty much whatever you want they'll whip it up. Two of us ordered BLTs (which was crispy bacon on homemade bread) and two ordered their Chicken Enchilada special. We were all quite happy!
AND, of course, we ordered one of their cinnamon buns to share. Holy crapballs..... That was AMAZING. I mean, A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I told the ladies that I needed a moment to myself and a cigarette!

I've had a few friends that complained about the length of time it took to get served. I didn't feel like it took long. I didn't time it, but heck.... it's fresh, it's made to order. The company was good. It was allll good!

Rumor has it that they're going to be moving to Palisades. You should check it out before they move. I'm sure the new place will be adorable, but you need to see this one too!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They are still opened they just moved to Mesa, AZ"}
{"text":"Great breakfast this morning. My first time here.
I will come back for lunch later in the week."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing. I had the pulled pork sandwich and chocolate cherry pie. The bread was so fluffy but crispy at the same time. The cherry pie was just the perfect sweetness on every bite. The place has a very homey atmosphere and its very casual. Owner Jen is super nice. Every thing is made from scratch and taste fresh. Try out this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A great little place!!  Service, food, and tea was delicious.  I had the turkey wrap with mayo on the side, so fresh and tasty!!  Ordered tea and it was perfect!!  We shared a cinnamon roll which was so nice; next time I will ask her to heat it up so all that sweet frosting and cinnamon will blend together!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe tucked back into an \"industrial\" area of Fountain Hills.It takes some effort to find this gem, but it is well worth the effort.

After hearing about this place for months, I finally stopped in for lunch.  I had their chicken salad sandwich, which was made with the fresh bread.  Delicious!

I sat at the bar, watching Jenny, the owner, as she calmly filled the many orders as they came in.  It's obvious this is a labor of love for her.  You can taste the difference, too.

The freshly baked items are enough to tempt anyone.  The cinnamon rolls are incredible  and oatmeal cookies a must try.

Whether a local or visitor, this is a must try place."}
{"text":"The best cinnamon rolls and friendly service.  This is what a small town restaurant should feel like."}
