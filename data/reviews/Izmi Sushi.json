{"text":"We have been frequenting Izmi Sushi for quite a while now. The sushi is always excellent, the fish is consistently fresh and the size of the sushi and maki are not too big, so you can comfortably eat one piece. Originally the whole point of sushi was to be bite sized, something many restaurants in Toronto forget when they use too much rice and drown out the flavour of the fish as well. Unlike every other place I have tried, I actually WANT to eat the California rolls here, and their version of Age Dashi Tofu is unique and delicious. Other hits we enjoy often are the Goma Yogoshi and Gyoza dumplings. Yes, you can always get a table, and the servers are polite and attentive. So sake-to-me!"}
{"text":"Izmi is the closest sushi place to my house, so by default it was where I had been going. 

After having take-out and dine-in a few times, I won't be back. Nothing is horribly wrong with this place, but nothing is good either. 

To-Ne Sushi on Queen by Spadina or Sushi Queen by University are both excellent and definitely worth the walk from here."}
{"text":"Sadly, Izmi Sushi has closed their doors a few months ago. It was a great sushi joint and it will be greatly missed in the Queen West area."}
{"text":"I've been to Izmi for a sit down meal and I've ordered take out and both experiences were pretty average. There are SO many sushi places in the city, it's hard to know which ones are good. For the price and quality of the food, I'd say this place was alright. I really liked that the green salad came with lots of veggies; tomatoes, cucumbers even avocado! Most Japanese places here throw in some iceberg and dressing and call it a salad. What's with that?

Their edamame was delicious - salty and hot and soy-y, it really hit the spot. The actually sushi itself was good, but pretty standard as far as sushi goes. 

You won't be disappointed if you eat here, but you won't be overly impressed either."}
{"text":"I got take-out here after a meeting at Czehoski a few days ago. I hadn't eaten all day, I had a sushi craving and it was the first place I came to walking back to my parked car.

I ORDERED the Vegetarian Maki Combo (18 pcs of Cucumber, Avocado, & Yam Tempura Roll) for $12.95, miso soup, and edamame.

I got home and found some other combo of veggie sushi. The three I actually ordered, as well as two I didn't. These random two were both ones I don't like. They BOTH had oshinko/daikon - one with mushrooms, one with spinach. GROSS. And the worst part is, these stupid sushi invaders took the place of my beloved ORDERED sushi rolls - there were still 18 total. So I was mad. And still hungry. The rolls I did eat were pretty fresh, but they were prone to falling apart.

The edamame and miso soup were fine, but come on. You don't get any points for that.

The staff was nice enough (i.e. not rude), but they didn't even offer me tea while I waited for my sushi to be prepared. The two girls just stood by the sushi bar giggling with the chef. Perhaps THAT'S why my order was messed up??? There was only ONE other table with people eating at it, so it clearly wasn't because of how busy they were.

I suppose the lesson learned is that one should double-check one's order before leaving the establishment. But at the same time, should I REALLY have to do this? NO!!!

Whew! That feels better! So... avoid this place. I will certainly never eat here again."}

{"text":"After an afternoon at the nearby Trinity Bellwoods Park, my husband and I were meeting up with some friends for Sushi. We went to Izmi because apparently our friend (who just moved in close by here) had been to this place and didn't mind the sushi. Of course I quickly checked Yelp before we went to get an idea of what I could expect. Unfortunately we still went. 

When we got there, around 6:45, we were the only diners in the restaurant. This already told me something about this place, never mind the reviews I had just read. We were promptly greeted (no kidding!) by the hostess (our waitress as well) and were taken to the table right by the window. Great spot, because then we could do some people watching on Queen Street. Because I had just come from a picnic in the park, I wasn't starving, but wanted to get an idea of the quality of food this place had to offer (given its lack of popularity). They've got the typical appetizers I've come to expect at a low-end sushi joint. Edamame, gyoza, tempura, miso soup, etc...Of course I jump right to their maki rolls (I know I'm not getting anything fancier as I'm not sure I trust this place). They have a bit of variety, though they stuff a lot of their \"fancier\" rolls with imitation crab (which I can't eat) so it limits my choices. My husband and I end up ordering an Asahi beer each to drink, one order of gyoza to share and 3 maki rolls (spicy salmon, spicy scallop, and a yam roll). 

Moments after our drinks arrive out waitress comes by with complimentary salad. The salad was nothing special, though I am always a fan of the dressing on the salads at sushi restaurants. After we finish our salads she brings our order of gyoza. The gyoza are very hot, which tells me they are fresh! Nice touch! Before we can begin eating them our waitress comes by with complimentary miso soup for everyone at the table. Now our gyoza have cooled down enough to eat so we dig in. The gyoza are nice and greasy, still hot on the inside, and when dipped in the accompanying sauce they are quite tasty. They became the #1 dish in our dining experience here. We drank our miso soup because it was there, but I really could have done without the extra sodium. Our rolls arrived on one big plate. I'm never a fan of this. I must prefer eating a roll and then having the next delivered. Just a personal preference. 

In my opinion the rolls were terrible. The scallop rolls had such a fishy flavour I could barely stomach them. The spicy salmon rolls had too much tempura flakes rolled into them and the yam rolls were simply flavourless. 

Overall I was not impressed by this place. With so many sushi restaurants to choose from on this strip, I would definitely recommend looking around before you stop here. Its cheap here, and if that's what you're looking for then that's what you'll get."}
{"text":"Izmi Sushi would have had three stars if it wasn't for the fire hazard propane tank heating apparatus they had in the dining room. Scary! If I had seen it before we sat down, I probably would have gone somewhere else. 

The sushi was seemingly expensive on the menu for the type of establishment it was, but when it arrived the portion sizes were wildly large. The dragon rolls were delicious, the salad was a strange iceberg lettuce leaf in a bowl of dressing - not so good. The gyoza were not comparable to other sushi restaurants of its calibre - skip them."}
