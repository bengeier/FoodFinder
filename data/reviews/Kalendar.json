{"text":"I always want to love this place for their darling patio and interesting inside ambiance, but am ALWAYS disappointed with the menu or service. 5-stars for looking cool...2 stars for everything else. For starters, the servers seem slightly pretentious or just less than thrilled to be at work. It takes a while to get water, etc. Came with my husband and another couple to give it one last shot. The brunch options are okay. My husbands mango stuffed french toast was completely underwhelming. It's paying good money just to eat a loaf of bread- and we had to wait about 15 min until a waiter came to our table so we could remind her we needed syrup for the loaf. I had the Egg Napoleon- which was okay. nothing to write home about. We all ordered tea. And although the tea comes in a cute- loose tea filter, the tea was weak and barely flavored the water. And for $3- disappointing. We won't be going back- unless just meeting a friend for coffee and want a cute place to chill."}
{"text":"After a bit of an issue trying to meet friends for a brunch that didn't work out, we luckily found a parking spot right outside Kalendar and decided to have brunch here.  We needed to be seated pretty quickly as my boyfriend is injured at the moment and needs to be seated comfortably.  The staff was very friendly and even offered to make an accommodation for him that would have prevented them from being able to seat people at the table next to us.  The coffee was delicious and we learned it is a special blend that they add cinnamon to.  I had the french toast and my boyfriend had an omelette.  The food came quickly and was tasty.  I really like the atmosphere here as it is cozy and makes me appreciate the winter, if that makes sense."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  I had the baby clam spaghetti which was very nice.  My wife had the seafood linguini which had lots of seafood in it.  We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"I have been to Kalendar no fewer than 40 times. Probably more.  I have lived in the neighborhood for 5 years and it used to be my go-to place for first dates.  Here's the thing: I just wish the food were better. It's okay, but it fights with the excellent atmosphere.   The restaurant is a gorgeous space. It looks like the perfect Parisian bistro. Why isn't it a perfect Parisian-style bistro? I would just love that.  Eating a lovely duck confit while looking at the old fashioned clock and antique mirrors while seated in their comfortable wooden chairs in the warm, dark, fuzzy atmosphere?  It's such a waste.  The menu is a bit of a confusing hodge-podge. It has some italian leanings, which might make sense if it weren't for the hints of middle eastern in every second dish.  And then there's the thai salad. And the Indian naan. Hm, why do they call it a bistro? Just because of the camembert and the mussels? Weird.   The simple wine list is decent enough for an easy glass with dinner, and they have good cake.  Far and away their best dish is the roast beef and asiago scroll.  They really get it right with this one.  It is warm, delicious, horseradishy, filling comfort food. I have cravings for it.  Some of the nanettes are pleasing and I have had one or two decent pizzas here.  Breakfast is hit and miss but the omelettes are tasty, if not fluffy, and they always have good specials. I have never had the stuffed french toast but it certainly looks attractive on a plate.  I enjoy the cinnamon-scented coffee, but that's a matter of opinion. Others are distracted by it.   My other kvetch is that you can't sit at a table to have a drink in the evening.  They have some crazy rule--tables are for dinner only. Okay, I get that you don't want me nursing a single G&T all night, sure, but what if I'm ordering two bottles of wine and some dessert?  My check would be way higher than someone ordering the carrot and ginger soup and a water--which by the way, I have done before solely to get a table.  Doesn't really make sense, and I have left more than once because I didn't want to be perched at the bar.   I have had excellent service here and I have had average service here. That might sound spotty, but it has never been bad service and that's something that not every restaurant can boast.      I realize I sound like I am being hard on the place, but for such a great atmosphere I just want it to be...better.    Regardless, I'm still a bit of a fan. It's just so PLEASANT.  It's the loveliest place on college to sit and have an inexpensive glass of wine and watch the pretty people go by.  And it's one of the few places left on the strip where it's okay to be an adult.  Great patio."}
{"text":"Most romantic restaurant in TO my A$$! From the photos you get an impression that it will be a beautiful and warm Parisian restaurant, walking in it is ANYTHING but!  It was cold and not welcoming at all, particularly from the Serve staff. The music was all Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z, which I don't mind but it didn't quite fit the place.   Our waiter was a thin straight haired brunette, she nice but extremely inattentive and unprofessional (you would find more professionalism at The Fox and The Fiddle or Kelsey's). She greeted us as if it we were someone she was passing in the street. She had no warmth or caring in anything she did. From greeting to clearing and wiping off a table.   Then there was the food. To say it was mediocre at best would be an understatement; it is truly terrible, even at its low cost.   We ordered a \"Scroll\" which came out looking like soggy mushy naan bread mess. The flavour, I kid you not, was the way a dirty wet cloths smells after a few days of use and its never quite dried. We also ordered 2 pastas which were OK in comparison and a muscle bowl. When we ordered the Mussels bowl there is 2 options of sizes Small and Large. We asked the difference and the response was 20-30 and 30-40. We got the large there was 18 pieces.  Bottom line if you are looking for a romantic spot grab a 7/11 burrito a box of wine and head to the lake front or nearest park for a picnic as it will be 100x more romantic and worth while.  This place gives restaurants a bad name!"}
{"text":"On a lovely thanksgiving morning, my fiancee and I were hankering for a delicious brunch experience. And so online I hopped looking for somewhere that would not disappoint as we are fairly picky in the food department.  Kalendar was introduced into our lives and I cannot say I was disappointed, in fact I was fairly impressed. Walking in, the staff was friendly, and the tables were small, but it added to the overall atmosphere. I ordered the eggs napolean and my husband-to-be had two meals (he's a big eater), omelet # 4 (the one with spicy sausage) and the stuffed french toast. The eggs napolean was super tasty, and filled me up nicely and both of his meals were delectable although I can't imagine only having the french toast (definetly not satisfying enough.... i need MEAT with breakfast!)  The biggest treat however, was their coffee. YUM! There is a cinnimoneyness to it (i know thats not a word) in aroma and taste. VERY impressed with that. Overall, delicious and will definetly be going back."}
{"text":"They make a great breakfast and I really enjoy their veggie curry scroll. It's a nice place to meet up with friends and enjoy a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"...Their cocktail list is playful, and extensive.  They definitely had a variety of options that I could easily entertain, but I opted for the South Beach (vodka, banana liqueur, mango juice, orange juice) because once I saw the banana liqueur (my favourite flavour for anything), I knew it was for me. Well, it's definitely an easy-drinking cocktail, basically tasting like juice, which I must say can be dangerous for some of us who are in a tender state of life-goal-confusion.  As tasty as it was (and therefore, maybe a good starter drink), it was probably even a little too sweet for me to drink throughout the night or with food.  Food wise, we started with a couple of shared appetizers:  Hummus Plate (with carrots, apple slices, olives and naan) I wasn't a fan of this hummus.  It was too \"gritty\" for me (not the smooth consistency I prefer), and while I prefer a more pronounced lemon flavour, was almost bitter from an excess of garlic.  Also, because of the strong garlic aroma, I definitely did not think the apple slices worked.    Baked Camembert (wrapped in phyllo, sprinkled with walnuts, served with berry puree, sliced pear and apple, and naan) This was a much more successful appetizer.  The Camembert was creamy, and mild, which was complemented nicely by the sweet puree and tart apples.  We all opted for half scrolls with salads, which were massive despite being the half size.  I also like that you are able to sub any other cold salad for a $3 up-charge if desired.  I only sampled mine and my partners, as I was a little sick and didn't want to spread the bug.  Scroll Three (Oven roasted chicken, sugar snap peas, carrots with sweet yellow curry sauce) Honey Roasted Beet salad (with chevre, walnuts and arugula) First of all, I love the roti-like wrap on these scrolls.  It's got a really satisfying chew, it holds up to significant weight and moisture, and it isn't heavy or tough. I did really like the flavour of this filling, the curry was aromatic and substantial, without feeling too rich.  However, I did find the texture a little off putting.  There was a little residual grittiness that I tend to experience if I haven't cooked out or really dissolved curry spices/paste well enough in a sauce.  Regardless, it was an enjoyable dish The beet salad was good, but not great.  I found the honey dressing a little bland, and very sparse on the greens, so I was looking for a little more acid and a bit more salt and pepper.   Scroll Six (Roast Beef, portabello mushroom, caramelized onion, asiago cheese, plum tomatoes with horseradish mayo) Honey Roasted Beet salad (with chevre, walnuts and arugula) This one was the best dish of the night (that I tried, at least).  The beef was a touch dry, but still, was not at all leathery or chewy.  All of the vegetables were well cooked and appropriate- the mushrooms were really meaty, while the onions and tomatoes lent a balanced hit of sweetness.  It was well lubricated with aromatic mayo, and bound together by a healthy helping of salty pungent cheese. That poor roti was seriously packed full, but I actually ate it all......"}
{"text":"Kalendar is a beautiful cozy restaurant located in Little Italy, west of College and Bathurst (just past Palmerston Street on the north side) that offers a Parisian vibe, owned and operated by childhood sweethearts known simply as Ellis and Cher-Ann.  Kalendar has come a long way. The building has been at its current location since 1912, and has always been a meeting place in the community. From its origins as a barber shop to its final transformation as a restaurant in 1994, the owners take pride in the fact that Kalendar has been named the best spot for a first date.  The atmosphere is beautifully romantic, with dark wood panelling and seating, dim lighting, and décor that sets off an intimate tone that almost makes you feel as if you have been transported to a European cafe. Our favourite spot is the 4 seater wooden booth in the far back corner underneath the almost unseen DJ booth, which we've somehow managed to snag a spot at every time we've gone (here's for travelling in large groups!)  The menu is varies from Italian and Indian-inspired cuisine, and they have a nice variety of wines and cocktails at a reasonable price. The dishes they are most known for is perhaps their \"scrolls\", which are rotis that are a mix of North American and Indian ingredients.  Taylor and I both ordered pizza at Kalendar, our favourite. The crust is always thin and the combinations of toppings put a creative and delicious twist on an otherwise ordinary, run-of-the-mill dish. I got a Mediterrean-style pizza--Pizza 1--a thin dahl-puri crust with olives, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, onions and feta cheese; Taylor got Pizza 4, a thin crust with a pesto base, a brie-style cheese, roasted chicken, roasted red peppers, yellow zucchini and red onion.  unnamed3The good: The food is well priced for the portions, and comes fairly quickly. They have a good size patio, perfect for watching College Street on those warm summer nights. The atmosphere is delightful and one of our favourites along this strip.  The bad: They don't take reservations so it's first come, first serve. Street parking during the day is usually available but come night time, it's almost always packed. The best option would be to look for parking lots or take the College streetcar.  Overall: Kalendar is a reasonably priced and warm little restaurant. It's usually always fairly crowded without being overwhelming packed, and it's the perfect spot for a first date or catch-up dinner with good friends."}
{"text":"Umm...how do I put this?   This place is kinda cute, but the food is nothing special unfortunately. Their menu is amazing, the way they market their dishes on the menu, however when you get the dish, it's just okay.  If you are just going for drinks, then maybe you will like it more, however as a restaurant its more of a 3 star place.   Due to its romantic ambiance we will probably be back for some tea and dessert in the summer, however I won't be eating food here most likely.   The service was very good and like I said the place has a cool vibe about it, do its a great option for a date:)"}
{"text":"There is something to be said about numbering some of their choice menu items and not labeling them with some fancy name -  just letting the ingredients speak for themselves.  Going to Kalendar for brunch was a lovely alternative to my usual taste for greasy spoon diner brunches. Sure they have your typical eggs with sausage, homefries and toast option, but the highlights center around their creative omelette flavour combinations that think outside the \"Western Omelette\" box that you'll likely not see anywhere else. You'll also want to take a gander at their specials board that go above and beyond for brunch.  And while Kalendars became synonymous with brunch for me, I had the pleasure of going for dinner there once and ordering scroll #6: roast beef, portobello mushroom, caramelized onion, asiago cheese and plum tomatoes with horseradish mayonnaise - seriously, no words... just hard, passionate emotions.  Shhh... not yet...  It's no surprise you'll be subjected to a 10-15 minute when you get there but man alive, is it worth it! Friendly staff and delicious food is really all we foodie folk ask for. This place has you covered!"}
{"text":"Delicious roti and salads. Very cozy place, perfect for a relaxing evening with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past year and I'm definitely a fan! I'm vegetarian, so I can only speak for the veggie dishes on the menu, but everything I've had has been delicious ... (except for the Scrolls). I don't know... maybe it's just me (????) They seem to be a hit with everyone else I talk to!) :)  The Tortellini is A-MAZING. I highly recommend THAT!  The service is great too. Very nice staff, and always quick to fix any issues. They seem like they truly care, which is refreshing :)  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot on College Street for breakfast or brunch. I love the coziness and the ambience of the environment. The food is moderately priced with decent portion size and tastes great. I would definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Only way to go is scrolls. Their pizza is pretty good. Salads were small and not great value. I don't really understand the consistent line ups."}
{"text":"Kalendar is the ultimate date spot. Quiet, dark tables inside or a lovely patio out front, and a menu that caters to vegetarians, meat-eaters, picky eaters, spicy food lovers, and for cheap/extravagant spenders. The appetizers all sound great: hummus/pitas/vegetables, soup, a lot of different salads - I've had the warm mushroom salad twice, and it's amazing - warm mushrooms, apples, etc.  On the lighter side of the menu are scrolls/naan-type pizza. Scrolls are like rotis but shaped like crepes. There were five different flavours, and they come served alone or with a side salad for around $10-$12. For around $16-$20, they have pastas, risottos, and meat dishes, and specials that change daily. The service was excellent both times I visited."}
{"text":"We went to Kalendar the other night because Utopia was full. Kalendar is a little bit more expensive than Utopia but it was well worth it.   The ambiance is really nice, the lighting and decor were very warm and romantic. We had the lobster ravioli and I had one of the scrolls with salad, which had chicken, avocado, tomato etc. in it.   Both dishes were great, I especially liked the ravioli, the sauce was creamy and the ravioli filling was filled primarily with lobster and not cheap fillers like a lot of lobster ravioli is. The portions here are huge which is also nice, especially when you are dining with someone who will end up eating half your meal if he is not satisfied with his, like I was.   We also had some sort of three-layer fudge cake for desert that was really delicious, the middle layer had a salty taste to it which I always love in sweet desserts.   The service was friendly and quick, I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I was wandering aimlessly down the street when the smell of the food from this place drew me in.  The lovely waitresses were very nice and I have to say extremely polite.  I got the lobster ravioli and it was very very good at the time.  Got food poisoning after wards.......  I can't even say that it wasn't them that give it to me because it was my first real meal of the day.  I want to try this place again just because the actual dining experience was so nice that I can forgive them for poisoning me. LOL"}
{"text":"I go here now and then for dinner and every experience has been memorable. I adore the interior, very homey and well put together. The staff is always accessible and give great advice and tips on menu selections. Personally, I would recommend the Park Medallions, they're the best i've had in the city ! Im not a wine expert, but the selection was wide and I liked what I ordered. Recommended for sure !"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   This place is popular for all the right reasons. The patio is terrific, and perfect for watching College Street or being seen on College Street. The interior is busy, yet comfortable. It's filled with hardwood, but it's not cold. The service can be inconsistent, as they sometimes have more customers than they can handle. Don't expect to get your bill, or a glass of water, right when you want it.  I've tried a few things, and everything was really good, including a spicy pumpkin soup. They have a unique Indian-fusion thing going on, with \"Nans\" and \"Scrolls\"... but the reality is it's a tasty wrap that's closer to a well-stuffed burrito than anything out of New Delhi.  Good vibe, solid atmosphere, above average food, and usually a seat for you and your party. Kalendar gets it right.  4 stars"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Nice Italian place.  I recommend a naanette (appetizer size oven baked naan bread). Try naan five- pesto, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, roasted red peppers & asiago cheese with spicy italian and roasted chicken!"}
{"text":"Just not good.   We ordered takeout from here, so I cannot comment on the atmosphere, decor etc.   Food just wasn't good at all, especially considering the price.  We ordered the Chicken Yucatan Soup, the Lobster Ravioli and Scroll 7 (with mara curry).    I was really looking forward to the ravioli (probably because I have been watching too much Hell's Kitchen) and I was really, really, really disappointed.  The overall taste was very bitter.  I really couldn't eat much of it.   The Yucatan Soup was extremely oily and the flavour was just bad.  Really bad.    Scroll 7 was also very bitter.   Overall it was just a complete waste - food was so overpriced and it was really poorly flavoured.    Will definitely not go back.  Ever."}
{"text":"I like the interior, and the service was very nice- down to earth, courteous yet with personality. The patio is a decent size (perhaps 20 seats), and styled in such a way to feel intimate without losing individual table privacy. It is a pleasant place to sip sangria/wine/whiskey with a date and enjoy Toronto summer.  However, the food wasn't anything special. Our appetizer of smoked trout was lovely, well portioned, tasty and with good condiments, while the 'scrolls' as mains, were bland (one with too much hummus, one with a vaguely sweet roasted pepper taste and everything else an indiscerible mass of warm, wet). As well, the roti like bread which the scrolls came in was dry, and poorly executed.  In short, go for drinks, enjoy the people watching, stick to light fare---"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed.  Drink menu is decent but everything here is boldly overpriced.  I ordered a dinner-sized Indian-style \"scroll\" with spicy curried vegetables that was essentially a bland sop of mushy vegetables (mostly canned chick peas) wrapped in roti.  Throw in a side salad and charge $18 for a most disappointing and mediocre meal.  For all the naan fusion they boast I thought it would come out differently..... and yet most of the food we ordered was nothing special at all.  Nice ambience - the wooden outfit and candle-lit tables will make you freak if you factor in the possible \"cute date place!\" designations.  I don't really care for Kalendar, food is a first for me!"}
{"text":"I had not been back  to Kalendar in about 20 years and to my surprise the menu had not changed - the scrolls that I remembered still on the menu as a few pasta and meat mains. Unfortunately the service was beyond bad. The server never checked in with us, and when she did, we asked for extra pita (as they didn't have bread) but this only came after my husband finished his entree. The food was average, with the smoked trout appetizer the only stand out. Nice presentation and delicious. The decor is lovely and a saving grace with its warm walls and romantic, eclectic French bistro vibe. Too bad all elements weren't in sync that night. I hope the owners/ managers realize that they can renew this once neighbourhood gem by focussing on service and a reimagined menu."}
{"text":"I really want Kalendar to be better than it is. The location is good and the vibe/decor is unique and interesting.  The big thing on the menu is their \"scrolls\", which are basically like rotis with North American and Indian-inspired filling. It's a great idea and works relatively well, but the scroll shells leave a lot to be desired. They're usually too dry and flavourless. I'd love it if they hooked up with the crew from Gandhi's so they could learn how to make a proper shell.  The last time I was there was in winter and they had some delicious warm drinks to choose from. I had a spiked cider with a cinnamon stick that was delicious.  The service is usually friendly and the space is cozy and comfortable.  Overall a nice place, but with room for improvement."}
{"text":"I Actually felt like I was sitting at a french bistro on the sidewalk in Paris, until I realized...nope just Toronto. The patio brings back warm memories of Paris, familiar chairs and awning really great cocktails and a warm brie, tomato and basil sandwich on a baguette...... YUMMO! I added ham of course and it was delish.  It came served with a side salad, I wasn't to fond of, personal prefence I think , my friend loved it, I found it a little soggy,  I would recommend this place for sure, in fact I look forward to visiting again in the near future to try one of there naan pizza things! They looked really good!"}
{"text":"The ambience is great (if you don't mind overly crowded and noisy) but for me, most of the food just doesn't deliver. Still, a nice spot to meet for a coffee and a chat."}
{"text":"Ah! Cute little place. Definitely ideal for dates.   First time I went last year, my friend and I were seated on the patio in between two ongoing blind dates and it was some good eavesdropping fun.   Second time around we sat inside by the bar and my friends and I got the Scrolls. Very oddly named but delicious. And I don't know what they put in their salad ...probably magic because it tasted amazing!  The service was not that bad either and better still, Kalendar is the perfect distance away from Big Chill."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, patio always busy on a warm summer evening so go at off-peak hours if you want to dine outside... very cosy inside in the winter. Some of the more adventurous menu items can be a bit hit or miss, but the scrolls are delicious."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for brunch on a Saturday around 11.  The 'brunch' menu is really small. Just some of their usual offerings + French toast from what I remember.  -DÉCOR- Kalendar is in my top 5 nicest restaurants in Toronto that don't break the bank. Rich wood everything with such a nice European/French flair. Prepare to be amazed (the patio in the summer is the best on College St.). And that clock out front is iconic. Definitely a place to bring someone you want to impress.  -FOOD- We came for brunch and we both had the French toast. The French toast were pretty good; average. Portion size was very large.  The fruit compote was just frozen bagged berries. The home fry potatoes were undercooked (yuck). I wouldn't bother having this menu item again.  Other peoples food looked really good so I'll have to come back for dinner.  -SERVICE- Unfriendly & indifferent. The maître d, who was also our waiter didn't crack a smile or really say anything other than \"how many people? What would you like to eat & another cup of coffee?\". First cup of coffee was cold, the second cup was lukewarm. Soy milk was brought out for me in a dispensing cup which was great. All the waitstaff looked like they were nursing hangovers or were genuinely not morning/afternoon people. I wasn't impressed with the service.  -SUMMARY- Great décor, okay food, lousy service. I was impressed by the décor but that was it. I'll have to come back for dinner to see what the evening fare and service is like. A future review is forth coming."}
{"text":"I've come here twice for 2 anniversary brunches and my bf and I love it. A bit expensive but pretty much well worth the price. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is so fresh and delicious. Their breakfast is a very decently sized portion and will fill you up quick. Service is very sweet. Homey and warm atmosphere. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"YUM! Our favourite quiet dinner/relaxing brunch place in Toronto for years. Our usual order is:  Warm Apple Walnut Salad Beet Carpaccio Salad Lobster Ravoili Swordfish  + a Kalendar Martini for good measure  We have literally had this meal every month for almost two years and the service, atmosphere, and friendly staff never fail to impress!"}
{"text":"The ambience is very warm with lots of wood and exposed brick, and dim lighting.  Music was mostly indie rock (Arcade Fire, Feist), not too loud but loud enough to hear it.  Our server for the evening was excellent, very friendly and helpful.   They don't take reservations, which wasn't a problem on a Sunday.    We ordered a bunch of items to share and everything was tasty, although perhaps not mind-blowing.  The wine list is short, but contains a good range of choices to suit all preferences, and my dining companion indulged in some of the fancy cocktails they do, and said they were lovely.    Overall a great dining experience, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came as a group for winterlicious 2017.   I didnt like the decor but it was a cozy comfortable restaurant.  My friends and I enjoyed our meal.  It was a wonderful winterlicious menu.  Lobster bisque had chunks of lobster meat and well flavoured.  I ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly.  The steak was enjoyed by my friends.  The grilled calamari was so juicy and tender.  Portions were huge and the taste was superb.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"One of my fav. places in the city. Absolutely lovely and people there are so friendly. I love the mussels with white wine sauce and the scrolls are simply amazing. :)   It's a must visit place in the city."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great in Summer and Winter with lovely patio and cosy interior. Good drinks and tasy food. The scrolls are delicious and filling and I order the same scroll 4 every time! Half scroll is huge btw!!"}
{"text":"Kalendar is a wonderful restaurant. Nice candlelit tables, warm decor, they offer an abundant selection of quality drink and food. The restaurant layout has a seperate bar and dining room area.     Everything we ordered was esquisitely prepared and tasted marvelous. Order scroll #6 beef filled naan, nice. (see pic)  I'd dine here anytime, anyday. Definite recommend.  C'est bon magnifique!"}
{"text":"We didn't really know what to expect when we saw the description of the Scrolls on the Kalendar Menu.  With the helpful reviews of some fellow Yelpers though, we were convinced to try.  Personally I had the roast beef and horseradish Scroll, and it's certainly something I would have again! Half was plenty, so only order a Full if you're famished.  My party of three also tried a Nannette, which is a decent app.  We had #4 with the havarti adn pine nuts.  Nothing mind-blowing, but not disappointing.  Without a drink, we paid about $25.  Not your every day staple, but a nice and casual night out."}
{"text":"I showed up with a group of 7 girls for brunch on a Sunday morning - which can be bad news for places that don't take reservations (like Kalendar). Fortunately, we hit the jackpot and scored the private booth which is by itself on the upper level in a little nook, separate from all of the other tables. It was perfect for a brunch date with the girls! Show up before 11 and ask for it.  Mimosas are $12 but come with your own mini bottle of champagne and juice (one order of mimosa = more than 1 mimosa).  Some of the girls had the scrolls which were all well reviewed. 2 of the girls had the french toast stuffed with banana mango and cream cheese which is absolutely enormous (picture half a loaf of french bread on a plate).  I ordered the vegetarian quiche which was fantastic and reasonable for $8.95. It was a mini round quiche as opposed to a slice of a larger pie. Came with a side salad of mixed greens.  Especially considering the size of our group, service was excellent. Our server was friendly and genuine. She earned the 15% that was added to our bill automatically due to the size of our group (I always hate when they do that).   Would definitely recommend it and return."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in Little Italy. The decor is very inviting; not too small tat it wouldn't be great for a large group and not too large that it wouldn't be nice for a couple.   The food there is unique. It is Indian and Italian fusion. The flavors do justice to Indian cooking especially the full vegetarian dishes, and the italian conservatist is not foregone as there isn't too much of everything.   I personally much preferred the nanettes to the scrolls. However, the scroll portions were fantastic. Half a scroll is good for a single person. But I don't eat alot. I can't imagine how large the full scrolls might be.  I personally wasn't a fan of the large pieces of beef and chicken in the scrolls. I think they should be chopped into smaller pieces. It was pretty difficult to eat without becoming a mess.  The beer selection was good. I was happy.  All in all it was a good experience. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"pretty cozy great patio service a little lazy good drinks the tortellini is really good - the wraps are alright the pizza uses some sort of thin naan and its great  breakfast is also pretty satisfying albeit expensive"}
{"text":"Great little joint in Little Italy to hang out with friends without breaking the bank. Loved the environment and patio. Great way to spend a lazy weekday afternoon catching up with friends.   The food was decent, but nothing spetacualr. 5 of us shared the hummus plate for appetizer. Most of us got the scrolls for main course. I think Scroll 3 would be my favourite.  My friend got the salmon quiche, which was quit delicious.  The only set back from our experience was the discovery of a giant bug in my friend's water cup. Very gross.  For that reason alone, I may not go back."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, good spot for a date. Prices are reasonable- could run you about $40 if you're frugal.  Didn't try any of the scrolls people are writing about on this page - had the half roasted chicken. It was a little on the dry side and didn't have much for additional flavor other than the sweet BBQ sauce that came with it. Also came with mashed sweet potatoes.   Caveat: Gave me the runs in about 25 minutes.  (this is bad for a date)"}
{"text":"Dans le genre faux-français, certains vont jusqu'au mobilier de café de boulevard. Ne vous laissez pas impressionner, la cuisine y est particulièrement fade ou sans intérêt. Dommage car ça pourrait être tellement mieux."}
{"text":"When my family and I had lunch here the other day, the food was COMPLETELY INEDIBLE.   -I ordered a 'smoked salmon quiche' (there is a choice between smoked salmon or spinach) and I received a soggy, microwaved spinach quiche with a piece of smoked salmon sitting on top of it. (They could have just told me that they didn't actually have smoked salmon quiche!!) -Salads were gritty and tasted of earth and the tomatoes in the salad tasted like they were rotting.   The horrific quality of the food here is just mind-boggling! I cannot even understand how they are in business. I am so fed up with garbage places like this in Toronto, making money off of food that a dog would probably not eat. I cannot wait for this place to be replaced by a restaurant owned by someone who cares, even a bit."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food throughout the entire menu and very reasonable with perfect casual atmosphere. Great service and good spot for a date"}
{"text":"I was walking down College Street with my personal trainer clutching my arm telling me I need to do more arm curls (I already did 100 that morning), and we were looking for a cosy place for brunch. It was really hot out and we were trying to get out of the sun (also as per her advice). I hired her because she trains Billy Blanks and I had just watched Showdown. Anyway I instinctively asked Siri where to get the best brunch in Toronto, and she told me the Drake Hotel but after my last visit and that altercation with the man in the awful tank top who claimed to be Chevy Chase's cousin (bullshit, they're all dead) I decided to skip that and go to Kalendar.   We got a reasonably decent table out on the patio however it was half in the sun and half in the shade (I of course gave the shade to my guest) and needless to say I was freaking out because I could feel the start of sweat pimples starting to form just from sitting there sipping on my second sangria (I chugged the first one). We both ordered the breakfast na'an. Mine had cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers, and a salad. Hers had who even cares. They were both delicious (I ate part of hers). I couldn't get enough.   Our waiter was bashful, I tend to be very intimidating to wait staff, but courteous and timely. No complaints for anything really. Just stellar. If only they had fried chicken and waffles. Then I'd give them more stars."}
{"text":"When I walked by Kalendar's for the very first time, I was attracted by their patio. Tastefully decorated with plants, flowers and hanging gourds, their patio was super cute and romantic for dinner and drinks! I went there with my roommate and we had a corner seat. Normal street level noisiness since it is on College St.  Food was alright. I ordered their \"scrolls\" which looked pretty good. Loved the cheese but it was a little watery, so watch out! Definitely used a knife and fork for this one lol. Their portions were actually pretty big so I only finished my salad and half scroll for dinner. Saved the other half for the next day's lunch!   Only downside is that the food took Foreverrrr to come out. We went there on a Sunday evening at around 5:30pm so I'm not sure why it took almost an hour for our food to come out... I had to ask the waitress a few times. Just make sure you aren't super hungry when you go there in case there's a long wait for the food!"}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere was on the cusp of being claustrophobic I still enjoyed the ambiance, then again I should have expected it seeing as though it was dinner time on a Saturday night.   Everyone was courteous and the service was pleasant. I had the scroll five without the option of a dinner salad and it was just enough food. The chicken was tender and there was just the right amount of herbed mayonnaise. My dinner buddy ordered the scroll seven and I have to admit I liked mine way more.   Oh and I also had a Tom Collins and enjoyed it to the last drop. Not too sugary and not too tart. Definitely tasted like it was made from freshly squeezed lemons."}
{"text":"It's true, it is a lovely date spot and on a lovely date I went!   It was cute that during Halloween weekend the staff dressed up in costume. Except the bartender who gave a flat out no when we was asked to put on the nautical jackets others were wearing.  Even though the place was hopping we were able to get a table right away, though it was a bit of a tight squeeze. The type of deal when you feel bad talking about slightly inappropriate things, worrying you might ruin someone else's meal.   I got the agnollotti with tomato sauce as opposed to being tossed in olive oil. It was delicious and beautiful! Some soft garlic bread to the side and the pasta itself was striped on one side with green and red. I felt bad cutting into them. The sauce was very nice though I will say they were a bit stingy with sundried and plum tomatoes. Parmegean and fresh pepper sprinkled on the top, delicious and I licked the plate clean with my garlic bread for dipping.   The boyfriend got Scroll 6, a roast beef one that I hadn't read the description on the menu so it was kind of cool tasting it without that original idea of what it was. The horseradish mayo really came through and it was an interesting to combine a crepe and roti. It was definitely more of a crepe-like packaging with a roti-like filling. You can definitely have the single or single with salad and be satisfied. The dinner portion is for two people! The thing would be about the portion of ordering two burritos. Delicious, unique and flavourful.   I like that it's the type of place where you can sit and have a luxurious meal for hours or it can go as quick as an hour. Being students, we just got entrees with water so we weren't around for too long. Great atmosphere and yes, great for a date or girls night!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with a cozy patio. Went as a part of the Summerlicious menu. For appetizers I got a lobster bisque, which was mediocre, entree was a veal masala. The two pieces of veal was half tough meat and half nicely tender meat. Served with a sauce not worth mentioning, 1,5 roasted potatoes and four pieces of broccoli. The cheesecake was okay at best. Service was relatively slow, but I guess a Friday night weighed on their staff. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We made the trip to Kalendar for a friend's birthday.  Our party of three were seated in a cute booth.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The decor was cozy and warm, definitely a date worthy place.  Food: We ordered a nanette appetizer to share. A nanette is like a pizza but with various toppings.  We got a veggie one (I forget the name).  It was delish! The nan bread was crispy yet soft.  My friend ordered a scroll lunch size with salad.  The portion was HUGE, I am afraid to ask about the dinner size! My friend really enjoyed the scroll, he got the italian sausage one.  He said it was a good balance of sauce to scroll.  My sister and I both ordered the risotto, she got hers with tiger shrimp and I got mine with roasted chicken.  We both enjoy our risotto, it was creamy and had ample veggies and our selected meats.  To close the meal, we shared a slice of creme brulee cheesecake! It was decedant and not too overtly sweet.  Our total meal came to $100 even with taxes and tip.  We were each pleased with our meal.  I would recommend Kalendar if you are looking for something different in the Little Italy area.  I want to check out their menu for brunch, I have heard good things."}
{"text":"On the hunt for outdoor seating we ended up at Kalendar. I've heard (and read) a lot about their brunch, but I was curious about dinner.  It's a small cozy restaurant.  If you are able to score a place on the patio or a table by a large open window, it's great.  Otherwise, the rest of the indoor seating is cramped and dark.  The first thing I reached for was the drink menu.  They had a good selection of cocktails, we had sangria which was fruity and not too sweet.  A bit pricey by the glass in my opinion.  The warm apple walnut salad was a great start to our meal. It smelled delicious and the goat cheese and apple were awesome together.  The salad was fantastic, but I wish it was bigger.  The lobster ravioli was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Just the right potion and you could actually taste the lobster.  My friend had the steak and vegetables.  It tasted alright, I feel like they didn't quite cook it at a high enough temperature.   I'm really glad I got the ravioli.  I kept glancing at people eating scrolls (the Kalendar version of roti).  It smelled good, but I'm unconvinced that I would be pleased.  If I want Indian food, I'd probably go to an actual Indian restaurant.  I hate bland curry that looks like curry but tastes like disappointment.  I'm sure I'll be back, perhaps for brunch.  Let's see if I can get my rating up to a four star."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Loved the warm mushroom salad. Others in the party enjoyed the Pizza one and the wild mushroom risotto. Happy Canada Day!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere, cool chandeliers. Get the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"Terrible service, even when the place is a ghost town. Food sounds good, but when it arrives its meh.  I usually regret going, there are much better places along college."}
{"text":"While on a trip to Toronto my group and I stumbled upon this restaurant totally by chance. We read the menu posted outside and thought it sounded interesting enough to try.  I would describe the menu as Mediterranean/Indian fusion. Naan was present in most of the lunch offerings, and when I went downstairs to use the restroom (or the \"washroom\" as they call it in Ontario) I saw all the staff were of Indian ethnicity. (btw - the washroom was spotless)  The atmosphere however was not Mediterranean/Indian, it reminded me of a little restaurant one might find in Germany, and it reminded one of the people in my group of a place you might find in Belgium.  The food was spectacular. I had the Hummus plate which came with carrots, apples, pieces of Naan, and olives. The Hummus was delicious and creamy, and dipping apples in it was something I would have never thought of doing on my own but I loved the way the flavors worked together.  Other people in my group had Nannettes, Scrolls, Quiche, and salad. It was all pleasant to look at, and everyone enjoyed their food very much.  The service here was excellent. We were a rather large group but they did everything in their power to seat us together. They placed us on the upper level in a booth in the back corner. It was very cozy.  Being tourists we had a lot of questions about the area and how mass transit worked. Our waitress was a fountain of information and even went a far as marking places on our map to go see...just so kind and so polite.  I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is tasty, and the service is the friendliest I have encountered in a large city.  Also - Not everyone in my group had Canadian money but they accepted US money no problem(of course the exchange rate was 1-1 at the time of my visit so that could have been why)."}
{"text":"I was taken here on a date a few weeks ago.  Happened to be rather cool for the patio but we risked it.    After our drinks and appetizers arrived I was excited to receive this bountiful bowl of mussels!!  I wish I could recite the exact name of the dish, because it wasn't the 'spicy red wine broth' appetizer.  I think it must've been on special. Anyways, it was a 'whisky' base which didn't have enough of the alcohol cooked out of it!!   No matter how many delicious over flavours I had over the course of dinner....there was this terrible over powering whiskey flavour.    I would like to go back and re-try the lobster ravioli.  I bet minus the whisky taste, it'll be even better.  Definitely worth trying!!"}
{"text":"I love the cozy atmosphere at Kalendar.  Yes, cozy means tight!  There aren't a lot of tables that seat more than 4, so if you're in a large group I would advise arriving early.    The longer I wait for a table, the hungrier I get and the higher my expectations for a good meal.  We waited about half an hour for a table for 4 during peak dinner hours.  (Not bad, in my opinion.)    I had trouble deciding what to order because there were so many good options to choose from.  Lots of vegetarian options too.  I went with a scroll (a crepe style roti) - scroll two if you're into specifics.  It was delicious!    Kalendar did not disappoint.  Great portions, very reasonable price, and good service considering how busy the restaurant was."}
{"text":"I got the Spicy Peanut and Cilantro Chicken.   I came for lunch on a...monday, I think(?) at about two. Wasn't busy, which was good. Food was delicious- simple, flavourful, fulfilling and delicious. I also had a glass of sangria and really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.  Definitely a good place to take a vegetarian friend to, since their choices seem to be pretty good for both meat eaters and non-meat eaters alike. A good spot to enjoy a relaxed evening with a date or maybe a friend or two, as their dinner menu looks pretty good.  I also like how they have a variety in hot drinks that extends beyond coffee and/or tea. The menu has alot of variety and options too, so I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people like this place or why it's mentioned as the most romantic brunch place.   Sure, the atmosphere is great but the food isn't. It's pretty awful. I wish Toronto actually had GOOD brunch places downtown without me having to go to Leslieville. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Today as I squired my new Yelp friend (and manager) from Denver, CO around the burbs and Toronto we met up with the bodacious Evelyn W in the big smoke for some TO-touring, and brunch.   After comparing options we set course in our tour for College street and settled on checking out one of Lady-Ev's fav hometown spots Kalendar!  It was a quaint little bistro located just west of College and Bathurst (just past Palmerston on the north side). Street parking during the day is readily available but know that this area is a flurry of activity come dinner and late night so be prepared to wait for have a hard fight for parking.  Entering i wasn't sure at first if this was a restaurant or one of those pop up Christmas stores. The decor was red and decked out in wood and there was a enough dry foliage in the window to rival a potpourri shop - Very cute.   The restaurant was freezing cold, and by the time I left, my toes were frozen from the consistent opening and closing door at the front. That being said, the warm smile and personality of our servers was enough to warm our hearts (womp womp - cheesy)!  As for the food they have an interesting take on hybridizing Indian and Italian food elements to make delicious lunch options. I devoured one of their Scrolls (full size) which is a sandwich made in a traditional Roti. the Scrolls have no name, just numbers. I had Scroll Six (roast beef, pita bello mushroom, caramelized onion, asiago cheese & plum tomatoes with horseradish mayonnaise).  Tiffany our Denver friend had one of their Nanettes which was a pizza made on a naan bread base (they tell you it's an open faced sandwich BUT I'm Italian folks, if it looks like pizza, smells like pizza but it's made on Nann... it's still pizza). And Evelyn had the soup of the day (an Indian style soup) and a Quiche (which looked delicious).  Perhaps my 3 star is a touch tight, however I feel 3.5 is about where they sit for lunch - good but nothing that I would drive all the way into the city just to have. I'll return for drinks because their cocktail menu looks impressive.  Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan! This place never disappoints!  For starters it's lovely inside and out - In the winter it is perfectly festive and warm... in the summer their patio is covered by shade trees... this is the place to go to celebrate, or take a date or take your mom...all in all it's charming.  The menu is a little odd but consistently good. Pizzas, \"scrolls\", dips all served on crepe-like naan breads."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a Saturday. We sat on the sidewalk patio which was really nice. It's at a great location on College at Euclid so it's fun to sit outside on a sunny day and watch the foot traffic go by. The coffee was decent and the service was prompt and friendly.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't very exciting. The best thing we ordered was my date's eggs napoleon. The ingredients were fresh, the sauce on the eggs was quite nice and the fried potatoes were good. The eggs themselves were overcooked though, so no runny yolk deliciousness dripping down onto the croissant. I had the most boring french toast of all time. I can't really say more than that. I mean... it was just boring, dry french toast made with nondescript bread and some nasty fruit compote on top. I got a side of sausages which were equally boring.  Oh well. I could see myself trying this place again for dinner... or just coming for drinks. The atmosphere inside did look quite inviting."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, but they could have done more with Indian flavors.  We enjoyed scroll six and pizza two, both with mushrooms instead of the meat.  Drinks were so-so.  Atmosphere was very intimate, good for couples and small groups."}
{"text":"Kalendar has a charming little patio that we were able to take advantage of during dinner on a Wednesday night.   \"Scroll 6\" was a crepe filled with sliced roast beef, portobellos, and asiago. I forgot about the 'horseradish mayo' until someone asked about it, and even then I couldn't taste it :(  One friend ordered \"Scroll 7\", with the curry filling, which she described as too overpowering to taste any of our other dishes, and another ordered one of the pizzas, which she thought could have benefited from actual tomato sauce vs tomato slices.  Overall, the portion sizes were filling, the price point was decent, and service was pleasant, but...pizza on dahl-puri crust? crespelles using roti? Pshh, if that's all you're doing to be Italian/Indian fusion..step up yo game, SON"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a mid-day brunch. Cute, friendly atmosphere..but I wasn't impressed by the service. I ordered a vegetarian quiche and my boyfriend got the burger. After ~25 minutes of waiting in the quiet, empty restaurant the server came and told us they were out of the burgers and said she should've told us earlier. My boyfriend reordered steak frites and after another 15 mins or so it came out...and my quiche was the salmon one. At this point I was too hangry to wait for a reorder, so I just ate it. It wasn't bad but I would've preferred the veggie one. My boyfriend ordered his steak med rare as well, and it came out med-med well. Could've been an off day for the server/kitchen but it was, nonetheless, a first impression. Probably wouldn't have cared as much if I wasn't fixed for time."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places. The food is to die for. A bit on the pricey side but totally worth it. Everything feels very eclectic and quaint."}
{"text":"Cute decor!   Not a whole lot of seating.  Tables in the bar were tight and table was wobbly.    Had pizza and salad that was good."}
{"text":"How do I love Toronto? Let me count the ways. French bistros with German names in Little Italy serving crisp, dal puri thin-crust pizzas; Nanettes - personal-pizza-sized naan-bread-pizzas; wild mushrooms cavorting in flagrante delicto with thyme in a risotto of dreams.   No, wait, that's all in just one Toronto restaurant.   I was introduced to Kalendar by my poet friend Flanagan. Have returned many times with my wife who develops cravings for the dal-puri pizza from time to time. Just celebrated my baby girl's 16th birthday there. Go! Buono appetito!"}
{"text":"Nothing really was impressive, but the space looks nice. Food was pretty tasteless. Attempted creativess but failed."}
{"text":"My new favorite bar! Love the building and ambiance and they have a great martini list!!"}
{"text":"Came here during taste of little Italy with a friend of mine and was very impressed! On a busy night for them, the service was still quick and friendly! The good was great and the portion sizes were a solid amount for your money's worth. We were lucky that it was a beautiful night and could enjoy the nice patio there which was the icing on the cake making this an awesome outing."}
{"text":"I've gone here for brunch on a couple of occasions. The service has always been great. I think I have been lucky enough to not have to wait. The food has always been yummy.. I ordered an omelette on both instances and both times they came out warm and cooked well. I recall that the portions were average. The home fries were yummy. I don't recall there being a lot of tea selection though."}
{"text":"On a night out to the Royal, my lady and I popped into Kalendar, after our first choice for dinner didn't quite pan out.  This place is certainly a great date spot. Fancy without being snobbish, classy if casual, and the menu is very reasonably priced. Our table was small and intimate, plunked next to a huge mirror.  My girl ordered one of their pizzas, and I went with Scroll Four (parm, tomatoes, Italian sausage, carrots, mushrooms, onions and peppers). The scroll was delicious, and loaded! My girl also let me sample the pizza, and while it wasn't too different from your standard pizza, there was nothing wrong with it, and she enjoyed it, though our portions were both large enough that we were barely able to finish. I think with drinks, the bill came to around $50. Not bad at all!  I'd love to return to this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner on the patio while strolling in Little Italy and am so glad we did! Everything on their menu sounded delicious and was relatively healthy. We both opted for a scroll (stuffed roti) and upgraded our side to one of their signature salads. Everything was prepared beautifully and tasted just as good! This place clearly values offering quality service and a cool, inviting atmosphere. Whether you're looking for brunch, lunch, dinner or just drinks, this place is worth trying out."}
{"text":"They have nice drinks and a really nice atmosphere. Nice place to meet friends. Food is okay - not outstanding. Recommended: Kosmo (drink) and mushroom wrap."}
{"text":"good brunch place in Little Italy.  I had Scroll # 7 (they seemed to be missing #3 & 5. odd), a thicker version of roti prata stuffed with curried broccoli, potatoes and mushrooms. The stuffing was flavorful. The 'scroll' was a little thick and hard to cut through but it was pretty tasty.  Mimosa was yummy too.  Prices are a tad expensive...but overall a good experience"}
{"text":"I fucking hate this place. I hate their stupid, watery, disgusting \"scrolls\". I hate that they call them scrolls. I hate their servers. I hate their gross, rich, mushy food. I literally have no idea why anyone would ever come here. It's like the shittiest version of Utopia ever."}
{"text":"I wish I was in theneighbourhood more often because this is a damn cute coffee shop with cinnamon infused coffee. It's just a nice touch, people.  This place gets crazy busy and can be off-putting just because you don't feel relaxed when there is a lineup out the door and the space between the tables is next to nothing as servers run past you.  But on a more relaxing day this is a super nice bistro where you can enjoy some quality food."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a lovely lunch here last Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a Nanette with caramelized onions, goat-cheese and bacon.  It was delicious.  The portion size was great.  It came with a side salad.  Presentation could have been slightly better (I don't like my salad touching anything warm on my plate).  We had a nice spot on the outdoor patio.  Service was fairly quick and the staff were polite.  I was tempted to order drinks but was attending a wedding for later, so I will have to return for cocktails!  My only true complaint is that their patio had its fair share of WASPS.  And I hate those pesky buggers, so I was on edge while consuming my lunch."}
{"text":"Ohhh! So *this* is Kalendar - I've heard of you so many times, but never been there, until last night.  Wandering around Little Italy, it was the first restaurant that did not have a 20-40 minute wait.  I was a bit confused at first since I thought it was a pure Italian restaurant (I always assume it's an Italian restaurant when I'm in Little Italy...), so I was skeptical to order any Indian dishes.  I got the stuffed pasta, and it was very yummy!  My two friends got the scrolls, and I was jealous - it looked so good! I'll definitely be back to try the other options on the menu.  Also, all this talk on yelp about the brunch makes me want to go back TODAY.  Very cute atmosphere for a date! Nice service and good prices.  You have to experience Kalendar at least once in your life if you live in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious dinner ($28). For app, had calamari and soup. The calamari was good, soup was average. For mains, had salmon (overcooked) and veal with mushrooms (not a fan). Dessert was good - nice big slice of cheesecake, and I can't remember the other dessert we got."}
{"text":"Nice experience for a romantic dinner. Interesting french concept and tasty food. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Kalendar Restaurant continues to impress.  We have gone here over the years for brunch and dinner, and we never leave disappointed.  We love, love the \"Warm Apple Walnut salad\" -chopped apples and walnuts sautéed in a sweet brandy sauce over chevre cheese on a bed of greens.    We also adore the \"Scroll Three\": oven roasted chicken, sugar snap peas & carrots with a sweet curry sauce.  Going back soon to try the Lobster Ravioli!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place in the winter I loved it  So hearty and filling Had this roti wrap thing - forget name but well worth it  Cozy spot Sign outside states best date spot in Toronto for like the last thirty years!!"}
{"text":"It's been on my list to visit for years and now is my new favourite restaurant.   Inside its reminiscent of a French Bistro. The menu an eclectic mix of Indian inspired foods but without being too ethic or fusiony.   For brunch you'll get the regular fare with the \"Scrolls\" , roti wrapped with stuffings like eggplant, hummus , peppers and artichokes. A half scroll $11.95 was more than enough for one person.   Also had the eggs napoleon. Poached eggs on to of a croissant (they had me at croissant) covered in a dill cream sauce. Also the roasted potatoes were excellent and crispy on the outside /soft on the inside.   The bottomless coffee was actually very good. Rich and nutty in flavour. Not watery.   My new favourite place not just for brunch but I noticed also their extensive beer / cider (including growers) at around $5 per pint/bottle. The desserts also looked really good too.   The place is bigger than it meets the eye. Thy take reservations for lunch and dinner. Not brunch but at 11:30am Sunday morning there were plenty of seats.   I would recommend dates,groups , even parents."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a brunch spot that doesn't require an hour wait; Kalendar is your spot. I've been here twice for brunch and been seated immediately and there's still tables left over.   The downside is that their brunch menu isn't overly extensive. They have a handful of omelets, steak and eggs, French toast and that's pretty much about it.   The plus side is that their coffee is delicious. I drink my coffee black and that little hint of cinnamon is so lovely in the morning. Also, their service is really attentive. Coffee/water refills nonstop!"}
{"text":"Descent.  Better choices in the area. Good price point. Good music. Good for groups. Bottles of wine for less than 50 dollars. Very large portions. Nice ambience.  I would go back. The veal was descent"}
{"text":"Kalendar is a great spot on college to get some tasty food at a great price in a restaurant with a lot of atmosphere. My favourite thing about Kalendar is the seating - little nooks with intimate seating and soft lighting to set the mood. The waiters are very friendly and attentive and great at recommending a good wine with your meal.  Food wise, the menu is pretty eclectic. Lots of veggie dishes and a lot of Indian-inspired dishes. Their scrolls - which are  crepe style rotis, served with a garden side salad. I got the one with roast beef, caramelized onions and mushrooms. It was so tasty and warm and filling - I highly recommend it, especially when the winter kicks in. Also the hummus plate is super tasty and the pizzas are all very delicious.   Check out the patio in the summer for the ultimate College Street experience."}
{"text":"Went here for a night out with a girl friend. Great atmosphere! Great food! There were so many options I wanted to try. Great options for vegetarians, pescatarians, lacose intolerant... (I could see why they would advertise as the \"best first date night spot\") I will definitely be back.   After tax and tip my meal (soup and a shared appetizer) was only $15."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love Kalendars. I love their appetizers- the black bean dip with mango pieces is de-lish. I love their martini's- especially the Chocolate Peppermint one (and one is never enough). I love their nannette's- i always get the Smoked Salmon (fresh smoked salmon layered on top of creamy cream cheese and warm naan bread, yum). I love their location (Little Italy) and I love their ambiance. Seriously, great for brunch, a romantic dinner or a night out with friends. Best is in the summer when the patio is open and you can people watch or just chat the night away in the warm summer breeze.  *Note they do not take reservations....so if it is at peak time there will be a wait."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 rating.  food was good.  i ordrred the lobster ravioli and my bf ordered the seafòod risotto. to be honest it was good not exceptional but fkavourful and the portions were grand.  the bill was but pricey with a tea and beer but all in all a decent experience.  decor had a vintage feel...hard to describe.  but its a cozy and good date place as it is quiet and therefore potentially romantic."}
{"text":"This is a really cute little restaurant that serves an Indian fusion style of food. For example I ordered a nanette (nanette #5 to be exact) and it's basically a pizza on naan. (Be aware the people working here may try to convince you it's an open-faced sandwich. It isn't.) And it was really quite good. The nanette came with artichokes, roasted red peppers, pesto, and I added Italian Sausage to it. It also was served with a small green salad on the side.  Our servers were lovely, bringing refills of coffee, hot water, and cool water as we needed them, but letting the three of us languish around the table with no rush. It's possible this is how everyone is in Toronto, but as an American where it sometimes seems as though servers might hate you based on the way they actively try to get you to leave I appreciated it.  There were three main menu sections and if I lived in the area I'd definitely be back to try another nanette, or a scroll, or possibly even a plain old sandwich or piece of quiche. As it stands I'm glad for the opportunity to try one of them."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times -- once for dinner, another time at lunch.  I love the location as well as the vibe to the place.  It's busy but intimate.  However....  The dinner was ok, though I can't remember very many specifics.  I had a soup and a pasta, both were nice but clearly not something that really stood out.  Decent drinks and service for a relatively large group of people (there were about 12 of us).  I'd rate dinner 3.5 stars.  My lunch experience here wasn't the greatest.  I ordered the Reuben sandwich and it reminded me of something I had at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was dripping in cheese, mayo, butter, grease...it was disgusting I couldn't eat it (I tore it apart and ended up picking at pieces).  I can't remember what my girlfriend ordered, but she ended up throwing up a couple of times during the meal.  Admittedly, she wasn't feeling the greatest before lunch, but whatever she ate did not help."}
{"text":"I'm still not sure what I think about Kalendar. It has earned a few return visits, at the very least to help me make up my mind.  The overall ambiance is laden with charm, the patio especially is a portal away from the semi-dinginess of most of Toronto's streets, while the inside proper feels like the kind of restaurant Paris locals would flock to.  Kalendar's selection of libations is, at the same time, thoughtful and adventurous, while still putting forth several safe choices I fear might outsell simply because of their presence on the menu. Huge bonus points for a purposely heavy pour and extremely good prices, considering, to say nothing of the name 'Cassis Me You Fool'. Wine and beer selection is surprisingly good, without going too far off the beaten path.  Spicy black bean hummus, yes, yes, dear lord yes. Beet root 'carpaccio', also very good. My concern with the menu is that they're trying to do a bit of everything; wraps, pizza, entrees, pasta; Mediterranean, Italian, Indian, Classic French. Everything we tried seemed very good, though it may have just been a case of getting lucky and choosing the right items. The swordfish in a ginger butter sauce, for example, was spectacular and for a moment made me forget that I'm iffy about seafood this far from the sea.  Service is consistent and casual, in the sense that you never feel rushed or unappreciated, though perhaps a little lacking on menu knowledge (it took three servers and ten minutes to figure out if one of the ports was a tawny or ruby, for instance). That aside, it was quick and full of smiles, and I'm really just a big snob.  Great for people-watching, great for drinking, thus far good for eating, understandably busy but painfully romantic. Kalendar is trying very hard to please everyone who walks in, every bit the double edged sword it sounds. So far though, so good."}
{"text":"Fairly priced, generous portions - big fan.  I had the Scroll 7 spicy with salad which was perfect."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out for years. Last night (a Friday) we stopped in without a reservation shortly after 8:30pm. There would have been a 30-40 minute wait for a table inside, but luckily there was room on the patio and the weather was just tolerable enough to do it so we gave it a go.  I ordered a Nannette to start, which was essentially a mini pizza on naan bread. I ordered one and was brought another which to be honest I didnt even notice until the waitress pointed out the mistaken ingredients. It was pretty bland flavours (I was saying halfway through how it need a sauce or something to give it some flavour) and broccoli that didnt seem cooked enough. The thing is looking back at the menu now, there is no Nannette with broccoli so Im guessing I got someones custom ordered item, so I cant really blame them for the taste as I can the service of the mixup. It was still tolerably good enough to not complain anyways. My date started with the mussels which were good but brought out without a side dish for shells until we asked for one. Another hit against the service.  For mains, my date had the lobster ravioli and only had good things to say. I had the lamb chops which were covered in a mango chutney, and served alongside sweet potato mashed and vegetables. I'm not used to such an overwhelmingly high amount of sweetness complimenting the lamb I eat but this did work quite well. My only complaint is that the lamb chops were more on the medium rare side than medium as ordered.   Their dessert menu looked great but we were stuffed full already and called it a dinner. In the end, 4 drinks 2 starters and 2 mains came to just over $110 after tax before tip.  I'd come back again as the place was good and Im curious to try their 'Scrolls', although next time make reservations as this place seems to stay busy and if it were any warmer I doubt we would've even gotten our spot on the patio."}
{"text":"Really cozy and the food is pretty good. Will definitely go back. Went with a group and we ordered a couple of there \"scrolls\" and we were really surprised with how good quality is. Fresh was the word most at the table used to describe the evening."}
{"text":"Winterlicious at Kalendar? No thank you. I haven't been since 2011 when I moved from Toronto but it remained one of my favourite restaurants in the city. Until today. I hope that it's just the winterlicious menu... but I'll be honest I'm afraid to try again with so much other choice in Toronto. Starter was ok, the entree (steak) was pitiful. I could have made a better steak at home, never mind that one third was inedible (cartilage or fat) and the sides that came with it were Swiss-Chalet worthy. The dessert was not even worth mentioning, I should have stuck with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Instead I asked for the tiramisu which looked like someone else's leftovers. Even after having it sent back and being told that was the last piece (which explained a lot) I was not even offered a coffee or a real apology.   It's a shame that for such a beautiful place they have such terrible service.. Food came out very slowly and service was slow even though the restaurant was not busy. Had to ask for dessert after rudely being served with our bill immediately after the entrees. The waiter was clearly having a bad day but there is no excuse for lazy cold service, and I cannot excuse Kalendar for throwing together such a below-average Winterlicious menus. For 10$ more I could have eaten at a far more  superior restaurant. Wholly disappointed."}
{"text":"Tucked just outside of Little Italy, this place is small and cute with a good size patio. Inside had a great old rustic feel that was very intimate but not intrusive to other patrons.   Brunch runs from 10:30am-3pm, which is perfect for a late riser like me. I chose to eat the eggs napoleon which is poached eggs with smoke salmon, spinach, mushrooms on a croissant topped with a cream dill sauce. I gotta say that the dill sauce turned me off a little but the croissant was excellent and I loved everything else, except the sauce.   My partner had one of the scrolls and I'm not sure if it was the wrong choice or what but this scroll tasted like poo. There was too much chick peas and the filling was just a jumbled mess or vegetables. The side salad that came with it was quite tasty and I would order that salad on its own.  Service was great but our waitress seemed a little spacey but it was family style and when our waitress wasn't around, other servers picked up the slack.   One thing was that there was a bunch of bees buzzing around our food and around us. I'm not one to be scared of bees but they were being quite intrusive that at one point I had to get up and leave the table because they would not leave me alone.   I'm 50-50 on whether or not I would go back but I do need to try their dinner menu and I think I may be pleasantly surprised as the food did smell delicious."}
{"text":"mmmm very yummy brunch! I got the omelet two with asparagus, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, herbs, and asiago. It was soooo good. We had a pretty big group and the service was relatively well paced. They have a large patio which was perfect. I can't wait to go back to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was not that great, I had the butternut squash pasta, had an extremely candy taste. The sauce was way too sweet. Our server was very average. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Beauuutiful interior that is casually date-worthy but gah, I can't get over the absolutely FORGETTABLE food. My friend and I tried the scrolls and the monk's tonic - really, nothing to write home about for these items. Try again later... maybe...  Nah, there are better places to patronize. Save your monies."}
{"text":"Kalendar is an ideal spot on College.  With a lot of places serving similar food with similar ambiance, Kalendar is unique in both areas.  It's a great spot for just drinks or a whole meal as well as brunch.    I really enjoy the different scrolls and naanettes (#1 for me!), as well as the pastas.  My friend swears by the pork medallions.  And the Kir Royale is now my favourite drink (sparkling wine and cassis)!  I don't think you can go wrong with Kalendar.  It's cozy and warm and the service is great.  Just be prepared for a wait on weekend nights!"}
{"text":"Here I have had a type of fusion cuisine I never thought I'd see: Italian and Indian.  And man of man is this place a good idea.  Pizzas on Naan breads.  \"Scrolls,\" their version of Roti, but filled with things out of an Italian pantry.  This is one of those types of cuisine where I find myself really surprised that I hadn't heard about it sooner.  Moreover, I'm surprised every restaurant ever isn't an Italian/Indian fusion.  In regards to price, I'd have to say that this place is a bit pricey, but for anyone interested in trying out something new, or just generally interested in eating good food, I'd say the price is worth it.  Certainly not an \"every night\" kind of place, but it's the perfect excuse to invent yourself a special occasion, just to come.  Line-ups around the dinner hours are pretty much guaranteed, especially if you want a seat on the patio in the warmer months.  If you want to eat here, be sure to plan ahead."}
{"text":"I was so lucky I walked into Kalendar when I did last night. After waiting 20 minutes in the rain for a southbound Bathurst streetcar that never came, my husband and I decided to change plans and have him come north to College. I walked west looking for a good place to dry off and grab a glass of wine. I skipped over Negroni, just not in a sandwich mood, and fortunately found Kalendar.  There were lots of seats at the bar, so I grabbed two and was instantly greeted by my friendly bartender. I perused the wine menu and he offered me tastes of as many wines as I wanted before choosing a bottle. He was truly a gem, and warmed my heart with his kindness.  When the husband did arrive, he was soaked. Turns out the northbound streetcars were also nonexistent and he had walked from King! What a trooper! Our lovely bartender and I ensured he had some red wine to warm him. All that was left was to decide on the food.  The menu has a lot of good choices. The naan bread appetizers looked really good, as did the crepe roti dishes. A few people near us were eating them, and I was sorely tempted. Instead we opted for some mussels in a deliciously spicy sauce (I had to opt out of some of those jalepenos, though!) and a warm mushroom salad. All the food was delicious.  This place gets crowded. After I had secured the bar seats, people just started streaming in. No one seemed to wait too long for a table, but be prepared, just in case. Kalendar is a popular place and now I know why"}
{"text":"Toronto can get busy, remember when choosing a place that planning ahead is best in these large cities!  We were able to find one of the last tables here, many other places were full. The restaurant itself is romantic and has a very nice decor as well very good service. This is a nice date night place.  The food was just okay, they kinda have a fusion thing going on. Like here is your Italian grandma and your girlfriend/boyfriend whatever in the kitchen next to them making two different things that may not flow with the meal. They bring it out, clash of dishes! Then before you know it everyone isn't talking and it's awkward......Yeah sometimes it works, here it didn't."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick brunch.  I had the smoked salmon/onion quiche but it was pretty much an onion quiche.  Service was ok.  Portions are decent.  An overall nice place to chill with friends."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to Kalendar because I know the food is going to be awesome. I've ordered the salmon entree several times as well as the apple walnut salad. They always taste perfect each time. I think the owner has served us a few times and he is always nice. I have special diet requirements and even though it always feels awkward going to restaurants with those, the servers have always made effort to accommodate them. The decor is beautiful and I take note of it each time. It's super cozy in the winter time and has a great vibe in the summer. The servers do seem pretty busy whenever I'm there, but I am honestly too busy enjoying the atmosphere with my friends and deciding what to eat on their awesome menu to be bothered by it! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Came to Kalendar's for brunch and was charmed by the spacious patio and well thought out eclectic decor welcoming us with worn wood chairs, worn wood bar, red walls, mirrors, interesting light fixtures, black table tops, and wooden molding lining all walls, doors, and windows. The patio was very roomy for a sidewalk patio and the surrounding plants gave us just enough separation from the street to feel cozy and intimate while allowing us to people watch at the same time.   The service is top notch with servers being very prompt and courteous. The servers came around and the perfect interval to see if everything was going smoothly and there were no hick ups.  The food was sadly disappointing. The best thing for brunch was the eggs napoleon but the dill was a little over powering and the poached eggs were a little overdone. The Scroll#2 was also very underwhelming, heavy on the humus and very light on the vegetables and the roti was flavorless.   Overall, this space would be great for drinks on the patio but as a food destination I was unimpressed. Maybe the dinner service will be better next time around. The prices are steep for the quality of food being received."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of people.  They accommodate groups well and the staff are attentive. The environment is nice.  The Napoleon is good. It's 2 pouched eggs on salmon, spinach, mushrooms and placed on croissant halves covered in a dill sauce. (3/5)  The French toast was plain and dry. (3/5)  The attention to detail is lacking. The pineapple garnish was a few days old. The coffee cup and saucer were chipped. The fruit juice tasted like frozen Mcain juice mix."}
{"text":"Rude management/service!!!!!!! Can't believe how they treat customers.   Food was really mediocre. Not really sure what style of food the restaurant is serving. Israeli/Italian?  Odd menu. Some of the dishes almost had a freezer/refrigerator taste to it.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was okay, even though it was empty the service was shit.  I wouldn't run to get back."}
{"text":"i don't go to little italy often but this is one of my fav places for brunch in the city.  They make a mean cup of coffee and I love the scrolls."}
{"text":"A reasonably priced and warm little place on college street.  I have always wanted to go here so really happy to have made the trip!  It's hard to have anything to add to the existing plethora of reviews.  Simply: food was fresh and tasty. Came fairly fast, too . Servers attentive.   I will comment on the space itself . It's quite charming. A comfortable old world flavour that isn't over top into kitsch.  Makes you want to stay awhile that's for sure.  I was quite taken by the lovely assortment of chandeliers and lighting implements. Everything is done really well here."}
{"text":"Went there on a hot (roommate) date.  It was fun. We sat on the patio, people watched on college and had a beer. We then ordered a pizza to split (mistake). As soon as we started eating we got way hungrier and wanted more. It was pretty delish! It's a great spot, especially for a cute little romantic date. AW!"}
{"text":"Yum. Thin thin crust pizza with delicious pesto! Unique and flavourful salads. Speedy and polite service and reasonable prices. A cute quaint environment to go with some good friends!"}
{"text":"Meh... Used to love the food here , came tonight for first time in 2 years and was very disappointed. Had the salad I used to have ... Half the size, over cooked chicken and overpriced . Great service but forgettable ."}
{"text":"A (young) friend & I had lunch here on a weekday.  This is a great place to meet up for a delicious fun food lunch in a quiet atmosphere.  We could actually have a pleasant conversation.  We both enjoyed our choices even though  we challenged our waiter with our food allergies and our uncompromising palate as we are both foodies.   With the chef's help in modifying our dishes to accommodating food allergies, we shared a salad then C. had a Scroll  (wrap) and I a burger.  Great dining & meeting outing for lunch & brunch but may be too casual for dinner for my boomer generation"}
{"text":"Kalendar has a unique atmosphere, it's like stepping into a quaint cosy cafe transported from a small town in France to the the streets of Little Italy. The furniture is all in dark wood, the lights are dim, and none of the clocks works. All the better to lose track of time over a meal!!  I came during the first cold spell of the winter, so the outside patio was already closed but looked to be a charming place to have dinner during the warmer months. Instead, a table by the large windows facing the street served the purpose of people watching. Extra points to the restaurant for having hot cider to ward off the chill, with a shot of dark rum to make it extra festive.  I had scroll 8 (oven roasted chicken, cheddar, black bean hummus, mango, red pepper, tomato & fresh cilantro) with a side salad. A scroll could best be described as their version of a roti. Not really a crepe, but not really a pita... somewhere in between. Still good, but not mind-blowing. Not sure I would place it in a category of it's own though, too much like a roti for me to add 'scroll' into my food vocabulary. The service was easy going and helpful, leaving us mostly to our own after our meal arrives and letting us linger over our drinks without pressure. 3 stars for the food, an extra one for the charming atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and has a warm home feeling to it. The idea for the restaurant was unique with all the seasons laid out around the place.  I decided to be spontaneous and order the Butternut Squash filled Ravioli combined with regular ricotta cheese filled raviolis covered in MAPLE CREAM SAUCE and Spicy Italian Sausage.  The sausage was very thinly sliced and you can tell it was dry.  The raviolis and maple cream sauce was so delicious though... I had to finish it. I would order it again!  I am curious to try other foods on their interesting menu."}
{"text":"Kalendar is such a cute, romantic restaurant. And the whole Italian-Indian fusion concept is interesting to say the least. We went on a double date on NYE and had a fantastic time. Few things before a review of the restaurant and food:   1. There's plenty of parking on the little lanes one-two blocks over. Free after 9pm.  2. They don't usually take reservations unless it's on a special night like NYE.   And now for the real review:   Interiors: Love the 4-seater wooden booth in the far corner in the back. That's my spot! It's interesting to note how this restaurant has utilized space. There's tables and chairs everywhere but it doesn't look cluttered.   Ambience: Super romantic. Dim, cozy and casual. Not quiet during dinner; infact, you will hear chipper from the tables around you but it's not loud. It's a feel good thing. Perfect for first dates.   Crowds: Couples, couples everywhere... and not a single man. Don't go here to pick up, ladies!!  Menu: They had NYE specials + the regular menu. Everything looks interesting but my boyfriend and I were at a loss when it came to ordering dinner. We didn't want Scrolls for NYE dinner and were disappointed that the Entrees didn't contain a lot of meat options.   Drinks: The drink menu was long! The cocktails didn't look that great although they did have some interesting options. My boyfriend ordered a South Beach which was okay. I really recommend ordering Cider. They have a good range and the Elderflower Cider my friend and I shared was absolutely amazing!   Food: I ordered the Spinach Tortellini. It came in a small bowl and from the looks of it, I was disappointed at the amount. However, it was super delicious and filling. Now, the real disappointment - I ordered Roasted Chicken on it; and what I received was a very minute amount of shredded chicken for an extra $4. My boyfriend ordered a veal scallopini; and although his plate looked huge and fantastic, he complained that there just wasn't enough meat. The veal was thinly sliced and he only got about 3-4 small slices. The only Entree that looked like a total hit was my friend's order of Lamb Chops. We also ordered an appetizer to share - the Baked Camembert. It was delicious. Something I would highly recommend.   Verdict? All things said and done, I quite liked Kalendar. I've been meaning to try it for a while and I am glad I did. I liked this place for a night out, but to be perfectly honest, it was a one time thing for me. It's not one of those places I would return to."}
{"text":"Love the decor (scored the back booth in the front room)! Menu is great with lots of interesting selections. Had the half scroll #6 - no cheese. the chick pea flour flat bread is basically like a roti. It was SO delicious and creamy tasting when I took my first bite, I had to call the server over to make sure they'd left out the cheese (they had, it was delicious horseradish mayo). My lunch companion had the nanette #3 which was good but a tad salty. Had the raspberry rhubarb pie for dessert - it was good. Definitely will bring boyfriend back here."}
{"text":"Heart salad!!! Keep coming back for it after a workout. So good! Melissa is my favorite waitress on College. She even remembers I don't like ice in my water and brings it without asking. All in all  - Kalendar my favorite place on College. Can't imagine the strip without it."}
{"text":"I  have been here a few times and its been good but the last couple times I went for brunch and lunch it was a disappointment. With all the awesome restaurants and bistros opening up in Toronto this one def doesn't compete much with what's out there."}
{"text":"We tried Kalendar for the first time last week and we were very impressed!  Awesome little patio and great atmosphere.  Our server was very friendly and made us feel at home.  We had mussels, pastas and a scroll - all excellent!  A little pricey but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious.  It seems to have an Indian-fusion-inspired menu, with interesting takes on various dishes.  All very delicious.  The staff was very friendly too.    Atmosphere: Dim-lit, very charming and vintage looking and very romantic.  Food: We had Scroll Eight (oven roasted chicken, cheddar, black bean hummus, mango, red pepper, tomato & fresh cilantro in a chickpea flour roti) which was big enough to share with my gf.  We also had the Pizza 2 (tomato sauce, spicy Italian sausage, caramelized onions, plum tomatoes and mozzarella on a dahl-puri crust).  Both were so unique and tasted AMAZING.  I'll definitely return here."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to Kalendar for a very long time and eventually did on NYE 2013. The lights on the trees and a patio decorated with candles lights drew my attention to this restaurant as I passed it on a street car. The restaurant seemed ever so romantic from the outside!   The restaurant on the inside is just as romantic with dim lighting, pretty lamps and wall decor. The restaurant was a little smaller than expected but had a cozy European feel to it. It was the ideal place for our NYE double date.   The food is well priced for the portions. I ordered the lamb which was served with mash potatoes, sweet salsa and fresh veggies. I have a very large appetite and I found it filling. The staff was very polite and patiently waited for us to make up our mind.   I think it is a charming romantic restaurant perfect  for a date with good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"An adorable little place on College Street that oozes coziness from every inch of its walls. Its funky decor, delicious brunch scents, and smiling waitstaff lured a hungry group of us in one Sunday morning. The place looked pretty packed so we weren't sure that our party of 7 could fit, but they took us to a cute little hideaway up some stairs where we had lots of privacy and a friendly booth.   As for the food, they offer your standard brunch fare as well as some Indian-flavored flatbread things they call nanettes. I wish I had ordered one of those, but I was in the mood for a sweet brunch and went with the Kalendar French Toast. I liked the berry compote a lot, but the bread was a bit too soggy for my taste (even for french toast).   The standout part of the meal for me was their coffee. They have a special blend with a local roastery and it has an amazingly unique cinnamon-tinged flavor that we all flipped out for, even those of us who weren't coffee fans. The other highlight was the sweetness of everyone who helped us, from the hostess to our waiter. We had just come from being rejected by an unfriendly host at Utopia and were grateful for the warm attitudes!"}
{"text":"Have been working in the area and decided to meet up with two girlfriend post-work for cocktails and eats. Have always walked by here but never thought to stop in. My pals (who live in the area) told me that not only did the patio make for good people watching but they had some of the best sangria in the city. I was sold.   The patio is huge and does offer up some great views of College St, close to Bathurst. While it can be noisy at times, it just adds to the ambiance. And besides: isn't that half the charm of sitting on a Toronto patio?  We ordered a jug of their white wine sangria ($32) and it was simply delicious. It had fruit in it, but everything was delicately chopped or soft. So you didn't get a jug of fruit trying to pass itself off as sangria. We have all had those, haven't we? The taste was simple, easy and perfect for a summer day.   The food menu is Parisian themed. It's divided up into different sections. My friends both got the mushroom salad with scallops. I opted for the mushroom risotto with chicken. The portions were very big. The prices were very reasonable. The food was excellent. Also, kudos to our server for answering questions about menu items and generally just being kick-ass.  If you're looking for a summer hang, Kalendar is the place. Chill, relaxed patio and good food."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing experience. Extremely rude service for no apparent reason!   My husband and I came here for dinner this past Friday evening on a friend's recommendation. It was a warm evening so we sat on the patio. We chose our picks from the summerlicous menu, then ordered some drinks. Our drinks came promptly, as did our appetizers - grilled calamari which was just OK.   The problems began when our steaks came out. Both covered in a peppercorn sauce. I had requested no sauce when I ordered, since I'm gluten-sensitive. I let the server know and he took it away. I told my husband to go ahead and dig into his. He ordered a medium steak, but it was medium-rare. When he told the server, he took a quick glance and said \"Nope, that's medium\" before quickly turning away to tend to another customer. Extremely rude. When we got his attention again to say that the other server must have switched our steaks by mistake (I asked for medium-rare), he was quick to answer back that the server placed the right one down (when he wasn't even there to see it). Shortly after, my steak arrived. Instead of medium-rare, it was well done. At this point, we were pretty frustrated so decided to just get up and pay for our drinks and calamari so that we could leave.   The server was rude off the bat, as if he had something against us. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. Will obviously never return. We already told our friends who referred us about our cringe-worthy experience. Luckily La Carnita was nearby, and we were able to finish our dinner :)"}
{"text":"Oh hey Kalendar, I see that you paid yelp to hide my review. I shudder to think what your actual star rating would be. Your food is not very good, though one time I had a pasta that I enjoyed, but the portion was really small."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Food wasn't very good. Had the mussels (pretty good) the pizza (terrible) and the swordfish (over cooked and dry). Also had an apple turnover style dessert which was not anything special. Great ambience however so would go back for drinks perhaps"}
{"text":"Checked out Kalendar with a group of 6 for a pre-Christmas meal and it was fantastic. It's been a couple years since I've been back to Kalendar, and that night, it was our Plan B since Sidecar was full and we had no reservations.  We arrived at Kalendar with no wait for a table.  Our group ordered a Scroll with salad ($14.95), 2 lamb chop entrees ($24.95), 2 orders of the seafood fettuccini ($23.95) and I got the lobster ravioli ($22.95), along with a couple pints of beer ($6.50) and a half litre of malbec ($22.00).  Our food order came up pretty quickly and all the dishes were hot and fresh.  My lobster ravioli was okay...it really was more ravioli than lobster.  I think I only tasted lobster on the first bite and there were at least 8 jumbo raviolis in the dish.  The seafood fettuccini was packed full of shrimp, scallop and mussel goodness...I should have got that.  Lamb chops were delivered exactly as ordered (medium rare and well done).    A few of us decided to get coffee and split a couple of desserts - daily cheesecake ($6.95) and the black bottom pecan pie ($7.95).  The pecan pie was served warm and drizzled with chocolate sauce - amazing.  The daily cheesecake was orange cranberry and good but a bit on the tart side.  Our server was great...speedy on the service but let us enjoy our meal at our own pace.  We loved the warm, cozy atmosphere and the romantic decor with the twinkly white lights.  Overall, a really great dinner and impressed everyone in our group."}
{"text":"Middling restaurant in the Little Italy section of Toronto. Mussel pot was fine as were most of the other entrees.  Prices were fair and they were mostly allergy friendly.  Even though there were many empty tables at 8:30PM they squeezed the 5 of us into a small booth.  Overall it was acceptable, but given the choice I would explore other nearby options before settling for Kalendars."}
{"text":"This place is very charming.  It has great ambiance and very nice lighter fare.  In the summer you can sit on the patio, but all the charm is inside.  I've had a very nice first date here once... but I digress.  It's very well located in Little Italy."}
{"text":"A charming and cosy little spot with dim lighting and rich colour schemes. The Parisian style patio opens to College St. and it is very good for people watching. The staff is friendly and efficient. The music during the night can be a little too loud. I had the Braised Beef Ravioli from their daily specials menu. The raviolis were large and beef filling was tender and succulent. I was quite impressed with the meal. Dinner for two and a bottle of decent Merlot went for just under $100."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, and choose it when I am feeling too classy for most of my usual haunts. It's got a lovely atmosphere, dim and romantic, with cozy booths and just so happens to have a pretty creative and tasty menu.  The scrolls are made with (as they call it) \"crepe-style roti\", rolling its eclectic ingredients into some addictive sandwich wraps. My favourite is the roast beef and asiago cheese, a wallop of a flavor burst if I've ever had one.   I've only had brunch there once, but want to have brunch there often, and get another chance with the fantastic mango, banana and cream cheese-stuffed french toast. Once again, a combination that I never would have really expected, and a very exciting result- oh! and speaking of exciting, the coffee is some of the best I've ever had, and I can't help but dream of it often- it had some sort of sweet spiciness that I can't put my finger on. My sister had the latte and it came in a gigantic bowl. That is all."}
{"text":"It was such a beautiful day I thought I would venture outside my condo and find myself a nice patio to do some homework and grab some lunch.  I was kind of bummed out that Kalandar's patio wasn't open yet but it was dead inside so I got to pick a nice table by the window. *does a little jig of happiness*  The service was great. My waitress was very attentive which is great because I needed coffee BADLY! Speaking of coffee... ORDER IT!  The coffee beans have made sweet sweet love to cinnamon sticks in the kitchen, resulting in the most amazing coffee I have ever had at a restaurant!  I got a small hummus plate (which is NOT small by the way!) If you think hummus and apples don't mix? Shut up and try it... then thank me :-)  My large Kalandar salad is also amazing... that being said anything with a gratuitous amount of feta is fine by me!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Kalendar for 3 yrs! It's always too busy in summer. couple of times when I wanted to make reservation, it was fully booked for d time frame I was checking. And forgot what other reasons are, I just somehow never made it there. Maybe I always go Queen/King street since its closer to me. I heard good things about them long ago. I finally made it tonite! It didnt disappoint me.   First of all, its on College Street. Away from downtown King Street West atmosphere. The moment you walk in, you will discover how inviting the place is. Everything seem to be little antique alike, but not boring. The menu is nicely printed. Everything is very Italian and...cute!   I ordered wild mushroom risotto with cream sauce, sun dried tomato, asparagus, and chicken. It was absolutely delicious and extremely comforting. My friend had lamb chop, however he didnt like the mango sauce on lamb lol. So he ate the meat and ditched the sauce. I didnt get to try it so I cant comment on that mango lamb. I guess I would agree with him with the mango. Lamb suppose to have strong flavor itself, simple seasoning is enough, i dont know if it goes well with fruit. But I know i cant really say that because I actually didnt try lol.   Cant believe my friend lives 1 min drive from there but never been there. He said he's def going back. So I guess I picked rite place. 4 Stars! I take 1 star off since he said he didnt like the mango sauce on lamb. lol. I will give 5 star for my dish. =D"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with a wooden interior - classic but not grungy. I tried Pizza Four, which comes on a flakey dough - simmilar to puff pastry dough. This results in a flaky texture but a limp pizza - I personally don't like limp pizza, I prefer to have it hold in my hand, but if you do like this I would definitely recommend the pizzas. My friend had the seafood pasta and it was SO good. For the price, they do NOT skimp out on the seafood. It had mussels, giant shrimp, scallops and lobster. She got a cream sauce to replace the tomato which resulted in a really heavy meal, we both agreed tomato would have been better. It's served with two pieces of garlic bread as well - just in case you weren't full enough hehe.  Would definitely come back here, that seafood pasta is calling my name!"}
{"text":"We met some friends for a reunion. What a disappointment this place was. The atmosphere is okay buIt a bit noisy. The server was friendly but the food took forever to arrive. The food was pretty disappointing. The menu offers some creative descriptions but the actual food is pretty bland. We had the \"scrolls\", Pizza Four and one of the pasta dishes. Bland and disappointing. I could never get the attention of the server to get some salt or something to get the dish to taste better. It was pretty tight and squeezed in there so it felt awkward.  We had friends with a child so that may have been why it felt so tight.  I wish we had gone to Sotto Voce instead."}
{"text":"Service was super slow - food was ok but bland for my taste, it was an interesting fusion mix of Indian, itialian, French, Hummus thrown in for good measure..abit confusing."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my salad. It had some of the freshest peaches I've ever had in a combination of walnuts and goat cheese over spring greens."}
{"text":"Amazing food, old-world charm! My husband and I came here for an impromptu date on Thanksgiving long weekend. Place was mostly empty due to the turkey holiday, of course, but that's exactly what we were looking for. Got a cozy table inside, although the patio looked romantically perfect too. Service was attentive and prompt. But the food was the best part! My hubby got the Seafood Linguini and I ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto. We shared both entrees and licked every last bit off our plates. Will definitely be back to try their more exotic dishes."}
{"text":"How cute is Kalendar?? Everytime I walk by (almost every day), I feel some sort of invisible force urging me to go inside. It's just one of those inviting, cozy places, and also has prime patio space which is usually packed in the summer.   This is a place where you could enjoy a romantic date inside,  bring your mom for brunch on the patio, or sip coffee by yourself and read the paper at a window seat. Their menu is very appealing with choices grouped off (naans, \"scrolls\", etc.). All I remember is that I had something with goat cheese and it was delicious. All of their dishes seem like relatively healthy options as well (just salads for sides here!)  The service was friendly and efficient, and the prices are pretty reasonable for what I consider to be a classy but casual place. Kalendar doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Kalendar never disappoints! Staff is always friendly, welcoming and efficient! Food always good. A family favourite! Portions are large and prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The concept of pizza with Naan as the crust is mind blowing in my opinion.  I'm obsessed with Naan, so when I heard that Kalendar served Naan pizza, I was all over that like a stripper on a pole.  I only took a quick look inside, but it definitely had that cafe like feel, with dark woods.  Joe and I grabbed a seat on the patio, which was fairly large, and had the added bonus of bench seating around the perimeter.  Joe and I decided it was too hot to indulge in some adult beverages, so we opted for the limonata instead.  It was nice, but a little too bubbly for me.    For my entree I decided on a Naan pizza with goat cheese, chicken, pesto, and I think artichokes, but I can't remember 100%.  It was good, but I wasn't blown away by it.  Granted the flavors were nice, but the Naan was a little flat.  I've definitely had better Naan in other places.  While I probably wouldn't come back here on my next visit to Toronto, if I lived in Toronto, I would come back here to try some of the different options they have."}
{"text":"Kalendar is one of those places that's perfect for a little rendezvous.... it's oh so very cozy and inviting. Like most the reviews have already stated their menu has a good selection.   Summer or winter you need to check this place out.. I suggest if it's a cold winter night (obvi. not the case anymore) this is a good place to go to warm up with an espresso or hot chocolate (so yummy!) In the summer the patio is great and you can watch the passersby.   Kalendar was recently in the movie 'One Week' with Joshua Jackson so if you're into checking out places where movies have been shot you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"Kalendar is a cute and affordable date spot on College. It joyfully lives on another planet than the rest of 905 ridden Little Italy, and I've been a fan for (gulp) 10 years.   Their Nanettes are essentially flat bread pizzas, and are decent. They aren't my favourite because they remind me of a time when I made \"pizza\" on Sobey's-bought stale naan during my undergrad days. This is my issue, though, not yours. I usually go for their scrolls, which are basically rotis stuffed with bistro fare. So tasty! My go to is number six, which is stuffed with roast beef, asiago and horseradish. A true swaddled delight.   Inside is dark wooded and lovely at night with candlelight. It's a bit cold temperature-wise in the winter, but hell, this is Toronto and they have a lot of old windows to fight with. Their patio is pure people-watching pleasure in the summer.   PEPPER POINTS for their loose teas. I had a really nice London Fog here. Who'd have thunk it."}
