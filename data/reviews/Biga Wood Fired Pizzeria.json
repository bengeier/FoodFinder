{"text":"This is the best pizza in the area for sure! Crust is amazing, toppings are very fresh. Old world style pizza. The brocolini and deserts are incredible too. Great service as well. I would rate this place 10 stars if i could."}
{"text":"Best pizza place there is in Lake County.  If you like fresh, good quality pizza go to Biga!!!"}
{"text":"First,  you can ignore any part of a review that references BYOB.  Good wine selection,  and a small but decent beer selection.  Also,  make reservations,  but don't miss a visit if you don't have them. 

We ordered the crispy salad to start.  Just enough of everything,  and not so much that you felt full.  Nice white balsamic dressing served on the salad.  We got a white pizza (PJ) and meatballs for our meal.  I missed the mushrooms in the description,  but still a good pizza.  Honestly,  I would have paid $ 20 for just that melt in your mouth crust.  Crispy on the outside,  soft inside.  The meatballs were just as good.  Firm,  but perfectly cooked.

We skipped desert,  but the tray they brought our looked spectacular.    Absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"The staff was welcoming and friendly.  The decor was simple and clean.  Many salad and pizza fixings are from local growers-- love Sage's apples!  But... the salad arrived without the bacon on it.  The pizza crusts were burnt-- one more than the other, but both were black.  And the desserts were good, but not OH MY good.  Wood stoves can turn out great pizza.  Hubby's had the best in the world in Brazil.  However, it takes careful control of the temperature and ingredient ratios to get it just right.  And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the prices are kind of steep-- our two pizza meal was over $60 plus tip.  If you've never had wood fired pizza, give it a try.  If you've had GOOD wood fired pizza, you might want to skip this one."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. Salads are excellent. Desserts are fabulous. Ingredients are seasonal.  
A bit pricey but worth it. Only open Thurs-Sunday."}
{"text":"Excellent Food!   We visited here while passing through on vacation.  You know what that can be like- trying to find good places to eat (other than the regular chains).  The watercress Salad was super fresh and huge.  Plan to share it.  We added prosciutto to the margherita pizza and wild fresh mushrooms to the 3 cheese & garlic pizza.  Amazing!!!  Dessert was equally fantastic- sour cream blueberry pie  w/ pecan crumbled top.  Local farm to table ingredients and great service.   We'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER. If you dont go here on a weekly basis you are crazy. The ingredients are fresh and the people are friendly. Its definatly workth the stop"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new place out. I had fond childhood memroies of when this used to be Tommy's from years ago.  Staff was nice but have to say it was way overpriced. We ordered three pizzas and paid forty one dollars.  Each of our pizzas were burned and my kids who eat nearly everything wouldn't finish. If you are looking for a great flat or want a good wood fire pizza, head down the street to bravo. Better pizza and lower price. Bravo has a great bacon flat for about ten bucks which serves two."}
{"text":"If you want exceptional pizza you need to go to biga! The staff was great the food came quickly and everything from the salad to the meatballs to the pizza was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Very unique place for Kirtland.  VERY expensive!  We had 1 salad and 2 pizzas and the bill was almost $50!  Probably won't be back...it was wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"I love Biga!! Have been there six times now and have enjoyed it each time. Local and fresh is important to me, and hard to find in this part of town! 

The salads are incredible, the pizza is fantastic. (The sweet sausage is a favorite in our family.) Look for the specials they rotate based on what's in season. Try to save room for dessert. Or just get it to go. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Dinner at BIGA Wood Fired Pizzeria in Kirtland.  AMAZING.  Cannot believe this was our first time here and it is 5 minutes from our house.  They specialize in the authentic Naples-style (\"Napoletana\") pizza pie cooked in a wood-fired hearth oven at over 900° F.  We had Gazpacho made with melon and fresh tomatoes, Wood Roasted Broccolini with lemon, parmesan & garlic, Rustica Pizza with Roasted artichoke, onion & Kalamata olives, oregano, parmesan & fresh mozzarella, and traditional thin red pie with Genovetta hot salami and sweet fresh sausage and Lemon Pie.  Service was superb.  Absolutely charming - will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"aside from noce in chardon, this is the best pizza i've had this far out in the burbs.  it is a tad expensive for what you get, but if you factor in gas money for going elsewhere farther away from home, it's not so bad.  we had the spicy pepperoni and the corn & bacon (w/ blue cheese, rosemary, basil & a white sauce).  both were really good-the crust is delicious.  they will be serving wine & beer in 2015, but right now it's byob for a $2 cork fee per person.  when we were halfway through our dinner, the waitress brought around a dessert tray to tempt us to \"preserve our appetite.\"  there were 4 options: a peanut butter pie, a blueberry sourcream pie with pecan crust, a lemon zucchini pound cake, and something the waitress called a homemade ho ho with irish cream filling.  not on the tray were italian \"donuts\" served with warm nutella.  (we were told that all were made by the owner's mother fresh this morning).  we opted for the donuts, which was really more like pizza dough brushed with butter and tossed in cinnamon and sugar, then sliced.  but it was warm and delicious with the nutella which we slathered on with a mini spatula.  would definitely return, i'm glad we found another good pizza place out here.  highly recommend a reservation.  they open at 5 on saturdays which is when we had ours for, and the restaurant filled up very quickly."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last night after reading several reviews most of which I totally agree with the pizza was awesome got the spicy pepperoni and sausage probably one of the best pizza I ever had. We got the Cesar salad and split it didn't really care for that too much seem to be only lettuce and croutons and artichokes kind of pricey for what you get but the pizza made up for it. We will definitely be back but skip the Caesar salad for sure.also the chairs in the patio a little uncomfortable would prefer to sit in the dining room next time.would have been five stars if the salad was better."}
{"text":"Ate here with my mom when we were looking for something close.  I will say that I'm upset that one of my childhood memories has been taken over (Kokomo's - RIP), but I'm pleasantly surprised with what has replaced it.  The place is SMALL so be sure to either call ahead to make reservations (if you can) or be prepared to possibly wait.  Although, given it's size the place is very cozy.  

As food the food and drinks, right now the place is BYOB so if you're looking to grab a glass of wine with that awesome pizza of theirs, it better be your own or you'll be SOL (we learned the hard way).  As for the food, we were very satisfied with our choices: we split a salad, a broccoli rabe appetizer, and the prosciutto and asparagus pizza.  Between the two of us we were stuffed and I had plenty of food to take home to my BF to last the next two days - I will say that we did order quite a bit of food, but we wanted to try more than just a pizza to get an idea of how their food tasted (or maybe we just wanted to break the diets and pig out on a Friday night...guess you'll never know!).  Everything was delicious and seasoned well and honestly I don't have a single complaint about their food options.  

I will say that I have a slight problem with this - their weird hours.  They're only open 3 or 4 days a week (you'll have to check their website or call to make sure) and I believe they're only open for dinner hours.  But other than that, I have no gripes and you shouldn't either once you experience this quaint little pizzeria in a quaint little town. 

Oh, and P.S.  If I overheard a conversation correctly, they just recently opened a patio so you may want to check that out on a nice evening."}
{"text":"Ok, we found this place thanks to Yelp and you savvy foodies, your high reviews took us, a group of 12 happy JW's, there expecting great pizza, the real Italian way and we were not one bit disappointed, everybody got a little of everything, salads are huge and ingredients are fresh and so delicious! We loved the pizza rústica, the antipasto with that wine cheese and the apple cheesecake I took to go cause there was no room left in my stomach, the next day I tasted it, oh wow! Best cheesecake ever! 1 slice feeds 3"}
{"text":"We met another couple out at Biga . Let's just say I think I found my new favorite pizza place! 

The breadsticks were great! And the sausage pizza phenonomenal! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Local leafy green salad was gok. Pizza was burnt (one wild mushroom and one pepperoni) black on bottom and crust. Not much flavor. Desserts were also bland (very large portions though). Fed a family of four with two pizzas, one salad, one lemonade and two coffees for $77 (subtract the cost of bringing our own beer and it was $75). Seems pretty pricey and the food was average or less than."}
{"text":"First, the pizza is OUTSTANDING. The crust is as good as it gets.
I ordered roasted broccolini as an appetizer. Even after sending it back for more cooking, it was inedible. I felt like a horse, trying to chew it. Chomp, chomp, chomp...  Choose something else. The salads looked great.
All desserts are made in house and they looked wonderful. 
The place is small and they have an odd schedule so make sure they're open before you go and get there early if you can. 
Pet peeve:  they make you ask for salt. Put a shaker or grinder on every table please and stop being arrogant!
Once the place fills up, it's very loud.  Their background music is Old Fogey Italian.  How about a mix to include some current material?
Bathrooms are spectacular. 
Parking, unspectacular. Mostly unpaved and all very cramped. 
The place is fairly new and I'm sure they're still working out the details."}
{"text":"Pizza comes a dime a dozen, it's become a favorite of, well...everyone! But let's face it, usually pizza isn't so appetizing and in some cases, it's no better than ketchup on bread. Not this place! Not by a longshot! Biga is a place where people with a more discriminating taste will get the freshest pizza but it's also served the way it's done in Italy. Local ingredients, seasonal menu, there is so much going right with this place, EVERYONE should go there if you want a pie that's done the way they serve it back in the Boot! You can't go wrong if you order whatever they've got going on special. It will be ingredients that just arrived that day. Seriously!

The owners make you feel like you're walking into their home. It's an energetic and truly special atmosphere with personal touches. Fresh flowers, fresh herbs (that eventually end up on your plate) and friendly banter. There's Etch-a-Sketches to doodle on while you wait. It's cozy and really easy to hang out there. You'll want to come back to Biga because everyone feels welcome there.

The desserts? Wow, you'll have a hard time deciding which one to choose! Save room. They are all done from scratch and they are the freshest you can buy. 

Bring a bottle of wine or some brew. They'll uncork it for you (no license for beer/wine but they say they're going to work on that) and you can enjoy what they've got cookin' at Biga. Bet it'll be one of your top 5 restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza with fresh ingredients (homemade sausage) and family owned.  The owner is a Pizza Bianco follower and does a great job.  I had a peperoni and sausage pizza.....very good!"}
{"text":"Nothing says \"we can't be friends\" like a Yelp review for Biga that checks in at less than four stars. 

It is, for all intents and purposes, the finest pizza cooked in an actual wood-fired oven in all of Northeast Ohio. 

If you're too lazy to drive or too cheap to pay for quality, perhaps sitting at home with a dish full of hot pockets and a library owned copy of Back to the Future III would be more your style."}
{"text":"My fiance lived in Mentor, OH for 18 months and we went to many restaurants in the area. This is clearly the best restaurant there. The pizza is genuinely good (by New York standard), and we still talk about their delicious dessert pizza."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times. If we want pizza, this is where we go! This is hands down the best pizza in the Cleveland area, and we're lucky it's in Kirtland! I love this place because all of their ingredients are grown locally. The salads are a great way to start your meal. Their pizzas are phenomenal!! There is a variety of pizza selections to choose from, my favorite being the margherita pizza! It's a classic and they make it to perfection! The staff is very friendly, as well as the owners! It's not often you come across a restaurant like this, but when you do you just keep coming back for more. I know we will!"}
{"text":"I've found the best pizza in Cleveland right here!!!

Combining the Neapolitan style of Crostada's with the helpful and passionate staff of Sweet Basil, Biga excels in all areas. Most impressive of all being the pizza.

There are so many things right with this place. The fact that it is about a 40-minute drive east didn't deter these West Siders from getting there within minutes of opening (5pm) yesterday. We'd called ahead (they take phone reservations via voicemail and will call back to confirm -- highly recommend you do this), and they had our cute table of four waiting for us, complete with high chair and two Etch-a-Sketches for the kids to play with.

Having read the reviews, we started off with the bread sticks. I could have made a meal of these alone. The bread was wonderful -- like an Italian version of Naan, but even better -- and the parmesan cheese and bright, flavorful tomato sauce made it sing. We also shared a salad of local greens (I think that was actually the name of the salad too). Very good, with fresh lettuce right from their own garden. (On the menu, by the way, an asterisk indicates which ingredients are grown right there in Biga's backyard.)

For the pizza, we tried three: the Margherita (because it's my favorite), the Spicy Pepperoni, and a seasonal white pie with bacon and asparagus. Holy hell...this was possibly one of the best selections of pizza I've ever eaten. The crust was from another planet. Unlike Crostata's, which falls a little limp and thin in the middle of the pie, Biga's was sturdy, yet chewy, throughout.  It passed the \"fold test\" yet you didn't really want to fold it because the aromatic flavors and textures more easily wafted to your nose if you left it open.

For dessert (how could we not?), we opted for the \"donuts\" (which were reminiscent of zeppoles from Italian street fairs, yet cut into thick strips), served with warm Nutella for dipping. Needless to say, we didn't leave any of those over (although we definitely could have -- there were enough donuts on that plate to feed the entire restaurant). The funny thing is that, even after feasting for an hour on all this delicious food, we didn't feel sick or stuffed on our way out. Perhaps it was because we boxed a good amount of pizza to go, but I can't help but think it's also due to the light, fresh ingredients that don't have added grease or sugar.

Knowing it was BYOB, we saved a bundle on not buying drinks and instead enjoyed our own beer in the chilled glasses they provided. And the bill came to just under $100 including a generous tip -- not bad for a family of four (yes, even the baby ate pizza and breadsticks!).

If you're in the Kirtland area -- or even if you're not -- pay a visit to Biga. You will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've had in Northeast Ohio. It is consistently good every time we go. Salads are great (and huge) with super fresh ingredients. Be careful though- the desserts have been underwhelming. They look much better than they taste. If you're in the mood for something sweet, skip the dessert tray and ask for the donuts- pizza dough with cinnamon/sugar served with Nutella. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, wonderful salads and gracious owners. Good place to stop when you don't feel like making dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I were leaving Patterson's Fruit Farm this afternoon and were looking for a place to have dinner.  Jumped on Yelp and found Biga's - never heard of it before tonight.  We weren't familiar at all with the area (Kirtland) so we took a chance based on the reviews we read.

We were seated immediately (probably lucky for Friday night at 6:30).  As soon as we walked in, we picked up the smells wafting from the kitchen and they were delicious.

Starting with the Crispy Salad - it was big enough that the four of us brought home about a third of it.  It was moist and delicious, and evenly covered with the house dressing. So good!

We also had the Wood Roasted Cheesy Bread Sticks.  After having one, I told my kids to stop eating them because if the pizzas were anywhere near as good as these, they'd be full and the pizzas wouldn't be eaten.  The side of tomato sauce for dipping was filled with flavor too.

We ordered two pizzas - the Spicy Pepperoni and the Margherita.  Both were fantastic.  They both seemed toasted on the bottom with a bit of blackening, and both crusts were chewey and moist.  The pepperoni pie was covered (literally) with them and it looked as good as it tasted.  The margherita was even more delicious as the basil tasted soo soo good, and the basil was melted right into the mozerella cheese.   We reluctantly stopped eating, leaving about 3 slices total to bring home.  That just means lunch will be great.

Our service was good - we were more than adequately checked on and we received everything we asked for. No issues here.

The bill (including four sodas) was $57 before the tip. 

I am already excited for my lunch tomorrow to finish what we brought home, and I'm also looking forward to getting back to eating there again.

If you're anywhere on the east side of Cleveland, I most definitely recommend Biga's."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a different restaurant for pizza.  I have always wanted to try Biga Wood Fired Pizzeria since they opened, but never made the decision to go there until today.  I have had wood fired pizzas before and this ranks right up near the top. We ordered the sweet sausage pizza.  Note they only have one size pizza (6 slices).
The pizza had a very thin crust and gets charred due to the wood fired oven which adds to the rustic taste.  All in all it was a very tasty pizza.  The sausage was different, not crumbled or chunked, but a flat sliver of pork sausage. 
My wife wanted dessert and chose the lemon meringue pie without the meringue or whipped cream and she said it was fantastic. We took home the two remaining slices of pizza and half of the lemon pie.
Our waitress was just fantastic.  She asked if we had been to the restaurant before, which we hadn't, so she explained the menu and the specials to us.  Her service was prompt and kept checking on us to see if everything was ok with our order.
The restaurant is nicely decorated, and very comfortable."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for authentic Neapolitan pizza, we found this place by happenstance. After looking at their menu on the net, it seemed promising; however, we've been lured by great-looking photos and enticing reviews of other so called Neapolitan style pizzerias and gotten used to disappointment. Not so with Biga. The pizzas, which push the rigid boundaries of true D.O.C. pizza napolitana, are really very good--actually great. The restaurant uses a lot of locally sourced ingredients, which are delicious. My wife and I ordered a pizza with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella that was wonderful. The pizza arrived looking exactly as it should: slightly charred cornicione (the rim) with a crust that was just the right thickness, topped with bright, beautiful cut cherry tomatoes. Our friends ordered a pepperoni--although not something you'd find in Italy--that was also very good. Other dishes I saw on other people's tables looked fresh and well prepared. 

The decor is very basic, with an outdoor deck, and the service very friendly and attentive. They don't have a liquor license, so you have to bring your own wine and beer. From someone who owns a wood-fired oven and has spent a lot of time in Italy, I think this place is the real deal. I hope people support it and it succeeds--I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been to Biga twice now.  First and foremost the pizza is fantastic.  The pizzas are wood fired. The crust  is thin yet chewy, with just the right amount of toppings.  My wife's sister is from northern Italy and she says this is the way they do it back home.  If you like thick, sloppy pizza with loads of cheese and toppings, you came to the wrong place.  The salads are fresh with a wonderful classic balsamic dressing which tastes light and not overpowering.  The salads are large enough to share.

They also have homemade in-house desserts which are exceptional.  We shared a generous portion of chocolate bread pudding.  We enjoyed it but I think it could have been better if it was warm.

Why not 5 stars?  The pizza is a bit pricey.  $11 to $17 depending on the ingredients. It ends up being about the size of a slightly larger medium pizza.  We shared a Prosciutto and Pistachio pizza which was $17.  For the amount of toppings we thought it was a bit over priced.

A few more observations:  At this time they do not have a beer and wine license.  The decor is clean and contemporary but the hard surfaces makes the acoustics of the dining room fairly loud even when it wasn't full.  The service and staff were very friendly on both occasions.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful surprise. It's a casual atmosphere where you bring your own alcohol and experience gourmet food. I've been here three times and have tried a number of pizzas, our favorite is spicy pepperoni. Their pizza a dough is perfect . Chewy , thin, but not tough."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to experience a wood fired pizza and Biga is a fantastic place for the experience. For over a half a century, I've been a red sauce, pepperoni and cheese guy but Biga has greatly expanded my vision of a pie.

Although the pepperoni is an excellent pie, just the right amount of red sauce and meat, wonderful taste, great feel, you really need to try one of the specials. Well worth the trip to Kirkland, be warned once you go there you will go back. 

Great place, great food, great people"}
{"text":"Right out of the gate:  pizza is very good.  The flavor and texture of the crust are 5 stars all the way BUT some parts of it were burnt.  Now, I know wood fired pizza ovens are screamingly hot but it was unevenly cooked in spots.  The Margherita pizza was good with the cheese and basil but I felt like it needed a touch of salt.  Mozzarella cheese on there was 5 stars just like the crust.  The pizza is served PIPING HOT...too hot to eat or taste when it arrives at the table.  So keep the table conversation going for at least 5 minutes while you stare it on the table (see:  torture).  The Caesar salad was a bit odd.  It is not like a traditional Caesar.  The meatballs were okay...there is some type of binder in them that makes them slightly crunchy.  Tomato sauce is good.  Ho Ho dessert was stupidly good and large enough for 3 of us to eat.  Now here is the real ding...it was hot as balls in the restaurant.  Again, I know those wood fired ovens kick off a lot of heat but it was downright uncomfortable in the restaurant to eat.  I don't know if their A/C wasn't working properly but I don't think I will go back there to eat when it is north of 80 degrees outside.  That, or I will get carryout or wait until Fall to go back.  Surprisingly, I was expecting this place to knock me over with its pizza but I would say it is pretty close to Crostata's in Highland Heights."}
{"text":"Had the special, A white pizza with garlic, cherry tomatoes and basil. A beautiful presentation, but Lacked flavor. The mushroom pizza had good flavor. Asked for extra sauce on side and sauce alone was bland. Also had the broccolini appetizer which was good. The owner is wonderful, glad to be there and very pleasant. Great outdoor screened in space. Alittle pricey for what you get, $13-16 for a pizza that is not enough for 2 people and a bit much for one. The deserts looked amazing, homemade. We didn't try them but will next time."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from multiple people over the past year, we finally made the trek out last night to check out the establishment. Usually when we hear about a place (or anything in general to be honest), the over-hype usually comes with less than stellar results. 
The reviews were spot on.
We ordered two pizzas, one red (Cerino), one white (Wild Mushroom), and for dessert, the wife had some dessert (I don't remember what it was called. I believe she said it was the pizza dough that was sweetened, cut into small strips, with a chocolate dipping sauce of some sort).
The pizzas were spot on as advertised. The crust was amazing (I'm not a crust eater usually), and it had the right amount of crunch without being overcooked, and the right amount of give (without it being doughy). I was a fan of the Cerino more than the Wild Mushroom but that's probably because the sausage on top was amazing.
So, with all the gushing comments, why only 4 and not 5? It could have, and should be 4.75. The service. It wasn't the pace (which was really good for a Saturday). It wasn't my usual pet peave of Servers holding the glass by the top (where my lips go!). It's the fact that you took my drink order and then tell me the drink specials. Also, when I asked between two pizzas and what they thought, she offered to give us more time. Again, it's a minor gripe and it shouldn't reflect negatively on the quality of food but it did slightly alter the experience. Hence the 4 and not 5. 
That being said, I'll be back there soon. A day later and I'm already looking forward to going back and trying something different."}
{"text":"Best pizza in NE Ohio. Ask for the prosciutto, pistachio and arugula pizza. Or the wood fired flat iron steak. Locally sources ingredients, great people."}
{"text":"BYOB.     The easiest thing to get right is the dinnerware.   They had undersized plates which could not even hold a
slice of pizza.  Had the pepperoni/Sicilian. Pizza.   The taste of the pizza was very good.  Seasoning was not overpowering.  The center of the pizza was a little doughy.   Not a lot of red sauce.   Crust was enjoyable.   
The salad for two was piled high (on a small plate) waiting for us to spill it everywhere.  Tasted good.   But had to be eaten with care so as not to make a total mess.
Don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"One of the best Napolitan style pizzas I've ever had. The servers are super nice, the atmosphere is casual but nice. A must visit in Lake county!!!"}
{"text":"I'd love to write a great review of this local new restaurant, but I have to be truthful. The staff and owner were friendly and accommodating. The decor was stark, but clean. The place could use some curtains or other soft surfaces to absorb sound - there was an echo. They need to buy some big-boy plates...we were provided with bread plates which we had to use for our salad and pizza. 

The salad was uninspired, and over priced. We had a salad with greens, shaved parm and balsamic dressing - not enough to be a meal for one alone, but we shared among three of us.  Biga's cook needs to learn the difference between raw, grilled and carmelized onions. Carmelized onions are sprinkled with a bit of salt, and slowly grilled in olive oil/butter until they are at least golden brown - yum. What we received on our pizza were flaccid undercooked bitter onions. The pizza dough was thin and had a decent texture. However, the toppings covered an area only half the size of the pizza. We had one salad and two 10\" pizzas between three of us, and our bill came to over $60. We didn't bother bringing the leftovers home. The restaurant is only open Thu - Sun...a bit odd. They don't have a liquor license, but invited us to bring our own beer or wine next time. Perhaps we'll try it again a few months from now and hopefully they'll make some changes. We'd like to have a good nearby restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"If you've ever wondered where you might be able to find a small, unassuming, family owned restaurant in NE Ohio that specializes in brick oven pizza, then you can no longer wonder!  Biga has a small, intimate interior with both indoor and patio seating, and their selection of pizza includes both white and red pies and a variety of fresh toppings. Is is important to note that the pizzas all come in one size, which is roughly equivalent to a small pie, are absolutely worth it due to the amazing taste! I got a red pie with mushrooms, which was excellent and more than enough to satisfy my often insatiable appetite despite the size. Make no mistake about it, Biga is exceptional and well worth the drive out to Kirtland."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing as other reviewers have said. The best wood fired pizza I have had in Ohio. 

To give point of reference, I find the best pizzeria type pizza to be either Dewey's or Geraci's. IMO this place has the best of its style of pizza.

Service:
I went here last week and was not disappointed. We arrived later on a Friday, figuring there would be room but we were surprised to see the place still packed. 

They graciously made room for us, when they were booked for reservations. 

Planning to go on a Weekend? Then call ahead and make sure you can get in. We almost missed out on the great pizza. 

The Service staff was attentive and polite.

Food:
My party and I ordered 3 pizza's, 2 salads, and 1 dessert. We had the margherita, the sweet sausage, and the pepperoni. The salad that was on special with raspberry dressing and a house greens salad, it was some of the best salad we have ever had, put together with locally grown lettuce. Beyond fresh and full of life.

This place has a great welcoming feel to it but with bigger parties it can get noisy, I feel it adds to the atmosphere of the place. Its a great little upscale pizza place. 

Bringing your own favorite beer or bottle of wine is also a plus for me.

Cost:
It was outstanding pizza, great flavor. The only downside is the cost, we would love to go back more often but dropping $70+ all said and done on salad's,pizza, and dessert,  is a bit crazy when you step back and think about it. However, after tasting the food those feelings go away quickly, until you get home and dwell :P"}
{"text":"We came in the other weekend for some pizza with the family. We did make reservations and sat quickly. It did get very busy in here and we were fortunate to be seated quickly. 
We all order different piZza's. We got the marguerita pizza , the special artichoke pizza and one with sausage. We also ordered the shaved fennel salad ! The sale was delicious and the pizza was average. 
I asked if they had a kids menu and she said yes we have a kids plain cheese pizza. 
When are pizzas came out my sighted got the full size marguerita pizza and was charged the same price. I don't want to spend 13 dollars on a kids meal. 
I am not sure if that was a mistake or not. 
One thing we didn't get was dessert and they did look Delicious. We may give this place another try without the kids to meet friends. 
Oh and one more thing. They just have beer and wine. I tried to order my go to drink a rum and diet. They don't carry rum !"}
{"text":"We had an awesome shaved fennel salad and a wild mushroom pizza.  I'll never be able to eat pizza anywhere else ever again.  Suggest a reservation.  You can now (2014) purchase beer and wine there."}
{"text":"Took the wife and my son and his girlfriend,  we had 3 awesome pizzas, excellent salad and a dessert to die for.  Service was top notch and I love when the owners are on premise and really try to make everything special.   Obviously we loved our experience and would highly recommend BIGA!"}
{"text":"The BEST Salad we have ever had, chilled with wonderful freshly sourced local ingredients.  We would go back for the salad alone but we also enjoyed the pizza.  You should go!"}
{"text":"This place is a GEM of a pizza place.  My FAVORITE PIZZA in the city.  Super flavor and the crust is light and chewy.  All the salads are fresh and delicious.  They are HUGE portions so u can split between 2 or 3 people.  Try the wood fired Broccolini as well.. 
 Service is always very attentive and the food comes out quickly...

This place is really starting to get noticed, but the consistency and service have not suffered.  If you are a thin crust pizza lover do yourself a favor and stop by  and give this place a shot.  

Oh that Spicy Pepperoni!  I'm going to get one of those tonight!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a hidden gem in our area! We had the breadsticks, the Three Cheese Garlic Pizza, and the Sweet Sausage Pizza. All were delicious and I was especially impressed by the crust- so soft and delicious. 

Besides the food, our service was good and quick! We were in and out in like half an hour! 

I'm sure we'll be back when we're wanting something other than the $5 Hot 'n Ready on pizza night."}
{"text":"We've been here twice... so far. 

My wife and I LOVE the food.

She had the Wild Mushroom pizza and I had the Sweet Fresh Sausage pizza. The crust is the perfect combination of crispy and soft and every topping adds a burst of complementing flavors that melt perfectly together in the mouth.

The Apps are equally satisfying. So far we've tried the meatballs and the breadsticks. Rustic taste and feel with a quality you can't ignore. 

The one time we decided to try dessert we ordered this giant version of a hoho that was, like I said, giant. It tasted great too.

The atmosphere is great. It's warm decor and friendly staff are both very welcoming. Someone could show up in formal attire or jeans and a t shirt and neither would seem weird.

I wish I could keep the place a secret, but I feel obligated to share so that they get more business and continue to bring their incredible food to our area."}
{"text":"Big fans and the pizzas are great! It is a bring your own drinks place though, noted for next time!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Biga.  Their Salads are amazing.  The pizza is light and flavorful.  You have to try the antipasto plate.  It is my families favorite.  We love the friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"My expectations were extremely high for Biga and they were absolutely met.  We went to Biga at 8:00 on a Friday night.  We had made reservations in advance and was glad because the place was pretty full.  We ordered two pizzas.  The pizzas we absolutely tremendous.  We had the J&B and the Spicy pepperoni.  You could taste the freshness of the ingredients.  The sausage was tremendous.  Both pizzas were equally good.  The pizzas are about the size of a dinner plate.  We did not get salads but they look incredible and they are huge- enough for two people for sure.  I also heard the desserts are great but had no room left.  The service was perfect.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  The only criticism I have about Biga is that it is small so it can be loud.  I also think the pizza is a bit expensive for its price.  That being said the food and service is amazing."}
{"text":"We've been anxious for Biga to open. We are fans of woodfired pizzas. We placed a carryout order. The crispy salad was delicious.  Fresh greens, crisp apples, creamy Gorgonzola. The dressing was house made with good quality olive oil and vinegar. We had a tomato pie, wild mushroom and a proscuitto/ pistachio. All were wonderful. Thin crust, fresh herbs complemented the topping. It was very enjoyable. We wish other resturants would care about ingredients and preparation the way Biga does. This is a new favorite for us."}
{"text":"WE WERE THERE FOR THE LAST MEATBALL NIGHT OF THE SEASON. 

If you don't know what that means, you should be really sad about it. 

My previous experience told me that Biga does pizzas the best I've had, salads better than I thought they could be at a \"pizza place\" and desserts that weren't pre-made, but delectable. Welp, this time around I relearned all the things--plus, MEATBALLS. Yes, all those caps, you guys. All of 'em! These balls are magical, perfection, the best meatballs you will ever have. I think there are 6 of them--so our party of 6 each got to try one. And just keep in mind they're smothered in Biga's effing ridiculously good red sauce. What? Yes. One was like a warning. \"Please--you must be limited! If not you will eat too many and have to be rolled away!\" Holy moly, roly meatballs. Biga knows what's up. 

That's why you should be sad. We were there for their last offering of the season, so don't expect those again until it gets a little chillier out. But in the meantime, you should go and have the best pie you've ever had. Ever."}
{"text":"Seriously good , real pizza, not some chain.

I wish the water was not full of clorine..."}
{"text":"Biga won my husband and me over, let me count the ways:

1) BYOB: we happily brought a bottle of wine to reminisce of a somewhat recent trip to Napa, opened with a very minimal corkage fee.

2) Local/Seasonal Salads A'plenty: so many delicious options to choose from, we went with the Beet, Pistachio, and goat cheese (perfect for sharing).

3) Creative/Innovative White *and* Red Pizzas: we ordered a pizza each, knowing that we would have leftovers. The husband went with the Smokey Blue (incredible!) and I went with the Napoletano (pure deliciousness). 

4) We were given a pizza box for said leftovers. And, when we forgot the pizza box on our table (that bottle of wine just might have gone to our heads?) we received a thoughtful phone call at the very beginning of our drive home (they had our phone # b/c I had made reservations). We were very thankful for that call and laughed as we turned around to pick up that blissful pizza.

5) Friendly, just attentive enough, service. And, really, they cared enough to call us and let us know we left our pizza on our table!

6) Leftovers. . .we cannot wait to enjoy tomorrow (morning).

Go to Biga! Thank me later!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in all of Ohio! Ive never been disappointed with anything I've ordered from here. Always fresh always delicious. The weekly specials change since they are based on seasonal produce...I still dream about the roasted root vegetables I got here last fall. Cant say enough good things."}
{"text":"I moved here six years ago from N. CA.
Been looking for a creative pizza chef. Found her at Biga. Sourdough crust like I had in San Francisco. Awesome"}
{"text":"Yesterday, was our first visit. The staff was friendly and pizza had a wonderful flavor.  However, we were stunned at what we got for $13:  pita-thin crust with just a hint of sauce / cheese. There were six small slices. Way overpriced.  This should be considered an appetizer. We have had pizza just as good at many other places where we got more crust, sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"Probably the most amazing pizza I've ever had. We got the special and the bolegnese, plus bread sticks and the broccolini. Every thing was amazing! So much flavor in everything. We brought a dessert home. It was the ho how and lord was it fantastic! Great job you guys, we'll see you soon."}
{"text":"Biga is in my list of top 3 Cleveland pizza places (with Vero and Citizen Pie). I will admit, I am a HUGE fan of wood-fired Neapolitan-style pizza. Pizza perfection. Apparently a lot of other people love Biga pizza too, because it's always full. MAKE RESERVATIONS via phone ahead of time!

The building itself is nothing spectacular. No razzle-dazzle. There are a handful of tables in a small room where you enter, and there is another handful of tables on an enclosed patio (seating year-round). Despite the wood-fired oven in the back right corner of the main room, the temperature inside Biga is never too hot. And I've never been cold on the enclosed patio. 

All reviews mentioning BYOB are outdated. Biga now has a small but respectable beer and wine (by the glass or bottle) menu. But the main attraction is the pizza. Oh, the pizza. It's stuff dreams are made of. 

I've tried multiple pizzas here, but the simple Margherita is one of my favorites. The pizza crust is cooked to perfection. Slightly charred. Slightly crisp, but simultaneously chewy. The tomato sauce is simple, and the tomato flavor shines through without being corrupt with a zillion spices. The fresh mozzarella is smooth and a little salty. The basil is fresh from live plants you can see growing right on the counter by the oven when you walk in. Simple perfection. 

The size of the pizza is also perfect. To me, wood-fired Neapolitan-style pizza does not reheat well when taken home. That just means I have to eat more when it is fresh from the oven! Ha! I always order my own pizza, and my plate is always clean. 

In addition to the pizza, the dessert at Biga is always outstanding. It's not listed on their online menu, but there are always at least 4 rotating choices that the server will present table-side on a tray. I think it's great to physically see the desserts rather than selecting what sounds good off a list. Serving sizes are enormous and great for sharing. The main problem is that it's hard to save room because the pizza is so delicious. 
  
Service at Biga is always impeccable. The servers are always prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable. The hostess is often the owner. The cherry on the top to a great pizza experience.  

I will continue to eat at Biga often, and I will always suggest it to friends and family. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I love it."}
{"text":"Ambience, fabulous. service, fabulous, pizza - liked it a lot, my hubs was disappointed because it was not traditional pizza."}
{"text":"I'm no pizza snob, but Biga just didn't do much for me. 

My favorite part of a gluttonous meal at any pizza joint is the bread-sticks appetizer, but Biga's bread sticks fell flat for me. They were warm and fresh...but not that flavorful. I doused them in sauce and they were still just ok.

My mother and I split a salad. That was good. And large for the price. But...it's hard to mess up a salad.

I had a mushroom pizza as my entree. I love me some salt, but it was a little salty for my liking. That made me have to downgrade my meal a bit.

Since my pizza wasn't all that satisfying, my mom and I decided to split pumpkin cheesecake. Pumpkin and cheesecake are two of my favorite things...but not when they're dried out. Weep womp.

Overall, a nice local wood fired pizza place...but for the price point, I expected a little better quality food. I do plan on going back to give Biga another shot, though...I might have just been there on an off night."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and fresh, flavorful salads. A little pricey, but worth it for the atmosphere and special dough recipe."}
{"text":"We ate at Biga when it first opened.  It is a very unique idea and a very nice newly remodeled facility.  I like that they use all locally grown produce and very fresh ingredients.  The menu is small, and lacking in choice due to seasonal limitations, it is only open wed-sat. So call before you head out.  Overall had a great time and really enjoyed the pizza."}
{"text":"holy cow. this place really knocked my socks off! it's tucked away in Kirtland, so you east-suburbians need to get over there! (across from Kirtland High School). This place is serving up some of the best pizza I've ever had! We started with the crispy salad, this is a must-order. It's a heaping plate (we split it 4 ways) of fresh crispy butter lettuce, honey crisp apples, (some other stuff that i can't remember right now) and tossed with a light and delicious vinaigrette. We got the spicy pepperoni pizza, which rocked, and the seasonal apple, cheddar, bacon pizza - which was mouth watering. As if all this food wasn't enough, we just had to try the homemade pumpkin bread pudding. YUM! I can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Pretentious and the pizza isn't even good! The crust was perfect however the red sauce is terrible. When we walked in were told we needed a reservation. Then they acted like they did us a favor giving us a table even though the place was half empty. Waitress was decent. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"In my quest for the best neapolitan style pie in the cleveland akron area, this was a surprise! I was expecting a good pizza, but the crust is hands down the best of the best, better than crostatas, flour, 3 palms. the starter must be the main difference maker. I'm impressed that they choose to eschew the caputo flour for a north american wheat and they're focus on locally sourced ingredients is laudable! bravo
dont miss the salads though one can feed several, and if possible save room for the housemade desserts, only wish they were closer to aurora"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and ambience. Great wood fired pizza. Nice perfect pizza crust. I am very happy they serve fresh local produce. First time i had whipped fresh mozzarella. Great salad and nice meatballs. The marinara sauce from meatball is very good. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This little pizza shop is out of the way but one of our favorite places for wood fired pizza!  The sun room is particularly a nice place to sit.  Servers are always friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. The special pizzas are particularly good, but on the last visit we really enjoyed the wood-fired broccolini and the mushroom pizza. The crust is not overly thin, and the wood firing gives it a good taste. We also ordered the Napoletano, not realizing it has very little cheese, and they were nice enough to remake it with mozzarella at our request, which made it much better.

We were also fortunate to go this past week on a night when they had the double lemon pie (okay, we went there specifically since the FB page posted they were making it!).  It's a lemon cream pie topped with lemon curd and is delicious!"}
{"text":"Good and consistent, but nothing AMAZING about it.  Menu needs to be updated, it has been a while.  They used to have seasonal items, but don't any longer.  Those were great."}
{"text":"The crust is unique and delicious. Plenty of options between white and red pizzas. Nice dining room, cozy side porch. Friendly service, hostess very welcoming. I like the focus on local ingredients. We split a Caesar salad and it was plenty big enough for two and was excellent. They now have a beer/wine license so it is no longer BYOB. My only complaint is very minor, could have used a bit more mozzarella on my pizza."}
{"text":"BIGA!!! SO GOOD. Really this place is top notch. The wood fire pizza really is just insanely good. The salad is insanely good too. I also really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. The best in this area. Worth the money! One of the best places in Ohio"}
{"text":"Limited menu primarily pizza, but when you do something right why stray from perfection. Ingredients are fresh. Salads are huge and make for a nicer starter (plenty big to share). I have been here many times and am never disappointed. 

Owner is very nice and is usually at the door to greet you. The Nutella ice cream cake is to die for. Save room! European Nutella flown in special (tastes different from what you get here in the states). 

I would recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"So, I head to a pizza place and discover the best damn Meatballs!  Seriously, why can I not find meatballs like this in Cincinnati.  Having grown up in Northeastern Ohio, I also grew up with good meatballs.  I have been on a quest for over a decade to find a meatball that stood up to the balls of the past.  The flavor of these meatballs was spectacular and the consistency was perfect...juicy goodness.  Don't get me wrong, the pizzas were fantastic too.  But, the meatballs...  This was also one of the few places that we stopped in that actually had some local craft beer.  Why is it so hard to stock local beer.  So many local breweries in the area.  Sorry, I digress.  Did I, however, mention the meatballs!?!?"}
{"text":"Delicious fire-stone pizza made to order. 
You may need reservations unless you luck out and go early. 
Great wait staff and varieties of pizza, salad and desserts to choose from. 
Meatballs and salad as an appetizer then had a yummy pizza topped off with dessert. 
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but worth every dollar and every bite!!  Too full for the desserts. They are big enough for two, three, maybe even four people to share. I will get back there another time just for dessert!"}
{"text":"The meatballs will make the saddest day seem insignificant as these are rolly Polly meat goodness.  We had the antipasto and it was super good.  The Cerino pizza with the locally made sausage was a delight.  Lookout for the desert as it will crash all dreams of a diet. :)  the staff are all kind and warm.  Well back to my desert."}
{"text":"What good fortune it was to completely stumble upon this place on a family trip to Lakeland Farm Park.  The \"wood fired pizza\" street sign caught my eye, my wife and I were starving, and we decided to give it a shot.  From the outside, it did not look like much, and the inside was small, but once we read the specials and learned about the locally sourced ingredients, we thought, yeah, this might be good.  

A few other nuances we noticed: bunches of fresh basil and thyme on the counter that was being plucked and used on the spot (think fresh-fresh-fresh), copies of Edible Cleveland at the hostess stand (if they read Edible Cleveland you know they are into the local high quality food scene), several etch-a-sketch available for kids to play with (my 2.5 year old loved it), and an awesome red wood burning pizza oven that is visible to the entire dining room floor.

We started off with a basic green salad (local greens), which we shared because it is huge!  The balsamic dressing was light and perfectly dressed.  We also got a set of bread sticks which arrived with a bowl of pizza sauce.  The bread sticks were wood fired and combined with the sauce were excellent.  I had to hold myself back from completely eating all of them.  I had to save some appetite for the pizza.

My wife's pizza was a white pizza with cherry tomatoes.  I selected the traditional four cheese and had extra basil added.   Coming out of the wood fire, they were absolutely amazing.  The quality and freshness of the ingredients is outstanding.  Pizzas are roughly sized to be individual servings.  In addition, the crust is very thin and crispy, so the pizzas are not very filling.  Without appetizers, one could easily eat an entire pizza.

I cannot begin to convey how fantastic the pizza is at Biga.  The quality and taste is unbelievable.  In fact, it is so good that my wife and I made another trip to Kirtland from Hudson (~45min drive) just to get their pizza again.  Second time, it was just as good.

I can see how some local people may not get it and are turned off by the price.  It is high quality pizza, done in a Neapolitan style, using the freshest local ingredients as possible, all made from scratch.  Biga is artisan pizza made by a person who has perfected the craft.  It is not mass produced and sold by volume by a bunch of teens running the pizza parlor on a Saturday night.  If you are looking for the latter, don't bother (in fact - stay away so I can get reservation when I want to eat at Biga).

As a side note, Biga does not have an alcohol license, but is bring your own bottle of wine with NO corkage fee!  

I don't care that a round trip will consume an hour and half to get to Biga and back to my house; Biga is so fantastic that my wife and I have made a commitment to dine there at least once a month.  If you are a foodie, I beg you to try it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited Biga for the first time last night and it was a great experience. The wood fired pizzas are absolutely great and the best way to make pizza in my opinion. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and had a very cozy \"at home\" feel. The wait staff is friendly, the food comes quickly and we will certainly be coming back soon. As of right now the restaurant is BYOB but the waitress told us they are working on getting a liquor license soon. MUST try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Had the cheese breadsticks for appetizer and they were very good.  Tried 2 different pizza pies which were both very good. Next time we need to save room for the desserts.  First visit but will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place satisfies a huge craving I've had since living in Italy. The pizza is perfect.

We started with the cheesy breadsticks and crispy salad. I would definitely get the crispy salad again. It tasted so fresh and had a light, delectable dressing. One was large enough to share among 3-4 people. We probably wouldn't get the breadsticks again if ordering pizza because it's basically pizza dough cut in strips and served with cheese on top and delicious red sauce on the side. They're great, but very filling, so I'd rather have salad and pizza.

I ordered the Classic Tomato, which is a simple pizza of tomato sauce, oregano, and parmesan. I loved it. The crust is just so, so well done. Crunchy on the bottom, soft on top. My companions enjoyed their mushroom and pepperoni pizzas as well. I can't wait to go back to try Margherita.

For dessert, we got the Biga Ho-ho and a piece of cake, of which I can't remember the name. Ho-ho was okay, but the cake was amazing. The deserts are huge and highly shareable. 

Service was great as well. I think our server was Angela(?) - I may be way off with the name, but she was wonderful! Perfectly attentive! We were seated on the enclosed patio and it was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It's such a warm and welcoming environment and the food is amazing. I would highly recommend the crispy salad. Perfect place for a date night or to bring the kids. A little pricey but totally worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Not many know of this gem in Kirtland,  and really glad (have it to ourselves lol). But by all means, come east you Westies!! 

All the dough is homemade as are  all sauces.  AND homemade sausage!  Fantastic! 

Great list of appetizers and nice variety of salads.  List of pizzas by read and white.  They are baked in a stone oven for a great crust.  Suggestion: Prosciutto and Pistachio - Best ever!! 

Nice wine list,  with limited beer selection. Finally,  homemade desserts that change often. 

Grab your Google map; put in Kirtland and Route 306 and prepare to enjoy yourselves!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in USA! So far. Being Italian, I guarantee you this the real pizza! Now I do not need to fly back home to Italy to get real pizza!
Thank you John"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried this place out a few nights ago because we kept passing yet and were curious to see how it was. I was pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is not real fancy but the food was great. The overall cost was very competitive but not too high. We will definitely be going here more often."}
