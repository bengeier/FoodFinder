{"text":"We usually go to the Viva Salsa in Boulder Station but we live a lot closer to this one so we decided to give it a shot. The first time was great staff was friendly and even though they don't have the best selections for salsa (compared to Boulder) they had our favorites. We went back a couple of nights ago and were served by Raul and we will NEVER go back. He messed up on every meal. My son ordered tacos without onion and cilantro (got onion and cilantro, Raul knew because he apologized as we went to get it and didn't fix it). I order a quesadilla with shredded chicken and got grilled chicken (most people would consider it an upgrade but I dislike the flavor). My husband ordered nachos with grilled chicken he got cheese nachos. He didn't notice right away because there was so much cheese he thought the chicken was under it but after starting to eat he noticed there was none. He went to talk to Raul and Raul said he order cheese and my husband say no I order grilled chicken. Raul argued with him as another employee finally showed up they went and got the receipt we were charged for chicken. So Raul goes and makes new nachos for my husband and when my husband grabs them Raul blames my husband again he was saying things like \"how did you not notice?\" Never once owning up to his own mistake and blaming my husband the whole time."}
{"text":"My go to for the BEST Mexican food !! I love fresh Mex, non greasy food and this place has it!!Small little unassuming place but they have the best nachos and chicken enchiladas and tacos!!I love all their fresh toppings that would take forever to prepare yourself and not to mention , the work!! I have been going here for 15plus years ! Since I first moved here .We would come here after swimming in the summer and we were starving!!They have the same food as the Mexican restaurant that , until recently, was right outside next door, but for a fraction of the price !"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, it is located in the Sunset Station Casino, right off the casino floor in probably the center of the casino or thereabouts.

The tacos here are awesome, beef or chicken, in a flour or corn tortilla, good flavor and very big.  The salsa bar is awesome as well, the tortilla chips are fresh, when you order your food, watch the staff make the food for you, since you can see the prep tables and grill.  There are only about six tables and a few small two seat tables available, so this place can fill up fast.  I have not tried the burritos yet, but from watching other customers and what they order, they look huge.  For the price, you cannot beat the quality of food, I can't wait to go back again during my next trip."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  I'm giving it a low rating because this place is dirty.  The service is also, extremely slow because they only have one person doing the register and the cooking (might be a health hazard handling money and food).  A manager type came out and did a walk around to inspect, and then walked away.  Apparently, the amount of food and wrappers all over the place met company tolerances."}
{"text":"Extremely bad and where to start off? Unfriendly, not welcoming staff. Food was BLAND and I'd rather have eaten Chipotle. Very slow service. Regrettable."}
{"text":"Finally tried Viva Salsa last night and boy am I glad I did. It was hella good and cheap, too!

For $5.95 plus tax I got 3 giant steak tacos (which I ate the guts only), chips and salsa and a drink. The bonus is the salsa bar. They have three different mouthwatering salsas to enjoy and also beans! From experience do not even attempt to put the HOT as hell beans in the tiny salsa cups provided. If you are like me you will burn yourself. Be smarter than the beans (and ding dong over here) and put them straight onto your plate. 

Overall I have to say this is a smokin' deal of a meal in a clean, little nook of the casino. Friendly and fast service, too. I will absolutely be back for more."}
{"text":"I am always craving Mexican food. My boyfriend and I were staying at the Boulder Station hotel and casino for a car show and didn't want to spend a fortune on food for the weekend. We stopped by this place for dinner real quick and it was so good! I got the taco plate with the rice and beans. All of it was delicious and super cheap! We ended up eating there again for lunch the next day right before we left Vegas. I would definitely recommend this place! Can't wait to get it again sometime."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos. They were amazing! 

Try them- you won't be disappointed. The Guacamole is also excellent!"}
{"text":"When we walked up the lady was leaning on the counter with gloves on. She took our order and our money still wearing the gloves. Then she took the order an money of the guy behind us. Then without washing her hands or changing the gloves made both orders. When my husband told her he saw this, she got an attitude and said she washed her hands. That's funny, because we watched the entire time. We asked for the manager, he said he would have her remake it, but never told her to wash her hands or change the gloves se was still wearing. We got out money back from the snooty old bag and went to chipotle in the parking lot. Will NEVER return to viva salsa."}
{"text":"Good service, great food. Ordered the torta special thinking it would be a bland meal. Boy, was I wrong! Everything was cooked to perfection. Tried two different types of salsa as well (green and red medium) which added just the right amount of kick to my meal.  Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'm thrilled I can share my new discovery of a little mexican joint with you all. It's  located inside the boulder station casino near the bigger restaurants... not the food court.

A few weeks ago my hub and I were desperate for food that wasn't fast food or sit down. We happen to stumble upon viva salsa which has a cheap and simple menu so we decided to try it.

I ordered the chicken taco plate, which includes rice, refried beans and the usual taco fixings + drink 5.99. My hub had the burrito plate that included the same sides + drink 5.99. In a nutshell we had a really delicious and fresh hot meal for under $13 that hit the spot on hunger and wallet.

The only small down side is we waited in line for about 20 minutes till we could order, but the food came out quicker than expected. Yay! I love this little taco joint and if you give it a try I'm sure you'll love it too!"}
{"text":"Viva Salsa was an unexpected find. I was going to go to Cabo for lunch only to find out they weren't open. But Viva Salsa was literally a few steps away. I decided to take my chances...and it was worth it. Large portions, reasonable pricing, no attitude, a simple salsa bar that has salsa with a kick (don't let the size fool ya, what they offer is good stuff!), and fountain drinks that are strong. This is on my short list of places for when I need a Mexican food fix. Service with a smile is always appreciated and I get that here."}
{"text":"Great little fast food mexican food joint. I really love their quesadilla that comes with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. My boyfriend also enjoyed their chicken nachos combo with rice and beans. Best thing in Boulder Station when it comes to take out!"}
{"text":"Definitely hit the spot following the Lee's beer and. Tequila experience! Tacos and nachos were pretty good. Nice selection with their salsa bar, even included a bean dip.  Steak and chicken were pretty equally good.   We had casino comps but I'd pay $6.99 for 3 tacos al carbons with rice, beans and soda!"}
{"text":"Let me say that Viva Salsa in Henderson at that Station Casino is more user friendly with spacious seating and a better, cleaner salsa bar with more choices! When we arrived, a supervisor at the casino was getting his meal and the cook Michel was handling his food like he was cooking for the Queen of England! You could see the steam off the food! I ordered what that guy had; quesadilla. This poor guy was very slow and not very personable with the public. As he was taking orders, a mean, chunky lady comes in and washes her hands and starts cooking! You would think that with her cooking your food would come out hot...NOT SO!!! Nothing was hot!!! I stood there and watched her cook!!! How can you cook food and it not be hot?!! And, the refried beans and spanish rice were not hot either! Looks like someone needs to take lessons from a solo driver at your sister casino!!! Will not be eating at this one again! And, since I am on Boulder...let me review my experience at the buffet two weeks ago...."}
{"text":"I had won $5 free grub on a card scratcher in the mail. Had never eaten here before so, I stopped in after work. Very clean, nice size, loved the salsa bar but, tables were not clean because only one person was working; not cool Station Casino! I am going to rating the Viva Salsa at Boulder in a few. The older lady working the counter was not feeling well, but she did a good job on the food! It was hot! Everything was hot!!! Thank you!!! Can't say that for Boulder... She was very kind and courteous! Even though she was the only person working, she handled the rush with grace! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Viva Salsa is in the heart of Boulder Station.  It's a small little place that is easy to navigate.  We got to the restaurant and there wasn't a line at all.  Now, for those who haven't read my other reviews should know that I eat Ultra Low Carb during the week.  So, I won't eat the tortillas, chips etc...  It wasn't a problem here though.  I ended up having a tortilla-less carne asada burrito.  It was really good and filling.  My sister and her husband were raving about their burritos as well.  They liked them so much they went back and ordered two more to take home.  The atmosphere is really laid back.  A few high tables that overlook the casino and the Kixx Bar.  It's a good place to relax and people watch, if that is what you are into.  Because there are definitely a cast of characters that tend to walk around this casino.  But, that is for a different review.

*side note: I was taking a ration of crap from my relatives in tow.  They were saying \"you're not one of those guys that takes pictures of your food are you?\"  So, out of my new insecurity I only got pictures of the front of the place and not my food.  So, next time I go, and there will be a next time, I'll grace you with a picture.

I say, a job well done and I'll be back as it is relatively close to home."}
{"text":"My son has been to this Viva Salsa a number of times since he lives in the area. He said it was really good. We stopped to look at the menu and I asked a table of people if it was good and the said \"Delicious\" and we're locals that come often. Ok, I'm warming to it-even though it looks like a fast food snack bar. 

My husband ordered the 2 enchiladas. Both beef as they were out of shredded chicken and would 10 minutes more until the next batch was out. I got the taco salad (recommended by folks that I spoke to) and son got a taco. It took a bit because they were busy (good sign). 

The order came up and everything looked really good. The enchiladas were good-not spectacular-but for $6.99 for 2 enchiladas, rice, beans and a drink, they were great! The taco salad was filled with shredded beef, olives, with less lettuce than the typical. The taco shell was nicely browned and was not greasy at all. 

There was a salsa bar with tasty pico de gallo and other salsas, and spicy refried beans. I tried the refried beans and pico de gallo on the taco salad and they were both really good. I couldn't eat but half the taco salad so my son finished it. 

We would definitely go back for a quick lunch. The food is pretty good and the price is great. There is even a Yelp check in offer for shrimp and crab enchiladas."}
{"text":"These are the Best nachos I have ever had in my life the flavor of the meet is amazing also the salsas that you can add to it and on top of that they have an amazing bean dip."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and was blown away at how good the food was. I ordered the #5 Enchilada plate and a #3 Taco plate for my friend. I honestly expected a mediocre meal, but the beans and rice were really flavorful! We both looked up at each other with surprise when we took that bite. I originally chose a shredded chicken and shredded beef enchilada on my first visit and both were fantastic! 

This time around, I chose the same plate, but they were out of shredded chicken, so I asked for grilled. The cashier said that it's an extra dollar. Normally, I'm like whatever on the upcharge, but this time I asked, \"It's still an extra dollar even though you're out of shredded chicken?!\" She said, \"Yeah, sorry.\" That's just dumb to me...if you don't have the regular shredded  chicken that comes with the dish for the customer to get and ALL you have IS the grilled, then why the hell would you upcharge when there clearly isn't a choice in the matter?!! 

The prices are decent and the quality of food is worth it to me. I've had worse Mexican food that cost more. Even their side dishes are well priced at 99 cents for a side of ride or beans. You and I both know that other Mexican restaurants will charge upwards of $3- $5 for a side of rice or beans and many of them have no flavor.

Besides that, other reviewers are correct in regards to the service. It can be a hit or miss and it all depends on what kind of mood the workers are in. Some things they do can be considered as rude, believe me, but for the most part they are okay."}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE! -  WE FOUND RAT DROPPINGS UNDER THEIR CHIPS!!

My family and I have been eating here for years and we will never go back again.  Underneath our large side order of tortilla chips were rodent droppings.  Please find a cleaner place to eat."}
{"text":"Quality of food vs cleanliness......oh how tortured is the reviewer!
So, I had a $5 Stations food credit and haven't tried the food here yet.  
 The 2 shrimp taco plate with rice, beans & soda is $5.99.  Not bad.
Very good shrimp tacos and beans, the rice was OK. Their salsa bar has many varieties. 
I noticed some trash on the counter that wasn't removed while I was there. The cooking area could've used a hose down too.
The cashier mentioned how busy it had been, so maybe no time to remove straw wrappers that were right in front of the register. My order was to go and the cook/chef presented it to me not to go. She boxed it up, no problem. 
There was a bug in my soda so I threw it out. 
Meh."}
{"text":"I really love this place they must have 10 or 12 different salsas to help your self with. It is inside the Boulder Casino and is a nice restaurant over looking the floor with privacy.
The service was very friendly and could help you with anything.
The food is really good and not too expensive."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant looking for some good Mexican food. What we found was not that...

We got there and the front of the restaurant looked cheap and commercial. It was not very big and we didn't see many people eating there. We started looking up and down the casino to see if something else looked better. But...

We decided to try the restaurant. Edgar, the chef, talked to us first and he said that he would be able to accommodate our wheat allergy. The food that he served us was great. I had just spent a week in San Antonio and none of those Mexican joints could hold a candle to this place. There was so much flavor, great portion size, and all three of us were stuffed for under $20. Thanks Edgar for such a great meal! Don't judge this book by its cover, get in there and let the food do the talking."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised at how good my nachos were.  This wasn't chips with fake cheese poured over...but real cheese and fresh ingredients!"}
