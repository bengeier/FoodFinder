{"text":"I'm surprised at the previous raters on how intelligent as they are, they are ridiculously ignorant on Sushi.  Sushi is Japanese and they don't offer Chinese noodles.  The owners are Chinese, and no offense to the Chinese people and when it comes to Sushi, Chinese place is not the place to go.  Having said that I will say this place is really good. I ordered the Chinese appetizer braised beef tendon, and it was delicious.  It was served hot with delicious soy sauce.  I ordered their Spicy noodles and that was delicious.  I just wished they would get rid of the Sushi crap.  Sushi is way overrated and is crap.  Ramen is overrated especially when you can get this kind of Chinese noodles.  I just wish they would serve homemade noodles.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I remember this place being the old yellow fin. Since then it has changed hands a couple of times I believe, and now it has reopened as Asian noodle. I went in during a lunch hour, and it was empty. The hostess/waitress was quiet and I was seated right away. I ordered a sushi lunch platter as well as a spicy tuna roll. The waitress went in the back and return with some miso soup and a salad which were pretty standard. Soon to follow was my sushi platter an extra roll and it was not good. Something didn't taste right, not sure if it was the rice or the fish but it just didn't taste good . I actually had to spit out my napkin. In the meantime the waitress went to the restroom and didn't come out for about 20 minutes and I just wanted to leave as quickly as possible. She was friendly but inattentive and  the only thing I took away from this was regret ."}
{"text":"Really good soup, good sushi. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I'd recommend giving it a try and trying out their variety of soups!"}
{"text":"Their place is homely and they have decent noodles. There is not much ambiance so I prefer to cary out. The owner is a quiet but kind woman. Based on the dishes it seems that the chef is professionally trained. Never tried sushi, but I've tried 3 noodles so far. The Chen's Spice Noodles is a flavorful noodle soup with pickled cabbage and a stew broth. If you are not used to Chinese pickled cabbage, I would ask them to skip it. The Chengdu Beef Noodle Soup was authentic and fairly spicy. The beef was soft and flavorful. The Fujian noodle is a stirfried noodle with decent amount of shrimp in it. People seem to do take out freqently. Looking forward to trying more dishes before they take a break in July and Aug for a trip back to China."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Asian Noodle and Sushi based on her checking out a Google rating for the place. She ordered Fujian rice noodles without the shrimp (they accommodated her due to food allergy). I ordered the spicy braised meat and vegetables over rice--it was delicious. The meat options are beef, chicken, pork, and beef tendon (there may have been more options). I had the beef tendon which are actually kind of meaty, sliced up thinly. The pickled vegetables are paired with sauteed yu choy greens and topped with a boiled egg split in half which was tasty and complemented the overall flavor well. It was not overly spicy. My daughter liked her dish as well. Our server did right by us and we appreciated her helpfulness with the menu items. The sushi rolls were fine--we ordered two 8-pc portions, one spicy tuna, the other salmon. The only minor knock is that its interior has more of a lunch place feel rather than a place where you go to have a nice sit-down meal. I generally prefer warm interior light to fluorescent but if you can get past this and focus on the food, you might enjoy the value of a decent meal at a reasonable price (they gave me a large enough portion of which I took home leftovers). FYI this is on Cedar St. in Champaign, not Urbana, the former location of Yellow Fin, which sadly I never got to try."}
{"text":"The sushi tastes fake. They use questionable ingredients and present it as top notch sushi."}
{"text":"I tried out this place with my fiancée today and I was unfortunately not too impressed.

The three stars I gave them was because the sushi we had was just alright. I had a rainbow roll and a spicy salmon roll. The rainbow roll only featured two kinds of fish (usually its 3-4 and includes shrimp) and some brown avocado. I think my fiancée had better luck with his choices. All in all, Harvest Markets sushi was much better for the price and it's a grocery store.

In addition, a couple other things were just a little off-putting. The place was silent, no music or anything, and we were the only customers there at one point which felt kind of awkward. Secondly, all three my fiancées rolls came out before mine so I had to wait to eat and he was practically finished by the time I got my food.

Lastly, the waiter ignored us for a bit and was sitting in the corner listening to headphones while we were hoping to get the check and a to-go box.

All in all, as someone who has worked in the service industry and values service and as someone who really enjoys sushi, it is unfortunately not going to be a place I recommend for either. All that being said, I still plan to back and try out the noodles and give them another chance!"}
