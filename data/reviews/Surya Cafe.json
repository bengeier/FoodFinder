{"text":"Delicious food and great vibes! The cafe is very relaxing and has a cute eclectic, bohemian vibe. The food is all plant-based, which I love. Also, the staff are so sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a good review because I don't want it to get crowded! The menu has a variety of flavors and textures. I had lots of options even though I have to follow a limited FODMAPs diet with few fruits and vegetables to choose from. The southwestern bean grain bowl looks small but it is very filling. I super loved the spiral carrots in peanut sauce and the kale squash salad.  The seasoning here is based on enhancing the natural flavors of the vegetables rather than overpowering them with spices or heat.  I love that!  But my hands down favorite is the sweet potato hemp butter chocolate mousse! I'd rather eat that than any other sweet.  No sugar hangover!! Bliss! 
I've eaten here three times and enjoyed the peaceful and nurturing vibe of the place.  You do not have to remove your shoes unless you are going to the yoga rooms BTW.  The decor reminds me of eating in a Cost Plus World Market store. There have been all kinds of people here - different ethnicities, ages, and genders - eating or for a yoga class.  
I like using a tablet to place my order rather than making a live person wait on me -because they are usually waiting as I have to consider every item in a dish before ordering. You also get your own coffee or make your own tea from the tea bar and I love that. It feels like a community room space rather than a restaurant.  
Some tables give you a view of the kitchen and you can watch the cook taking the time to  mindfully make your meal.  With others you can sit and look out at the prairie and the sky (and the Promega buildings...)."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate lunch there today. Both of us loved our sandwiches; she got the Sunflower Beet Burger, and I got the Jackfruit Jerk sandwich. The bread for both was delicious, and the flavors were rich but subtle. It was also really comfortable; they kept it warm (important for Wisconsin!) and the women working were extra friendly and knowledgeable about what was in the dishes and how they were made. Really looking forward to getting back there for diner, because there were at least three dishes on the diner menu that got me excited. Especially after our experience at lunch."}
{"text":"My experiences at Surya Cafe have been absolutely excellent! I frequently order Meg's Toast, the Blush Blossom Sumie, Swimming Angels, and I always add a cup of soup. I've had an African peanut soup as well as kitchari and both were so flavorful and delicious. The Zucchini Noodle Alfredo is amazing--order that if you're feeling fancy :) The food is so unique and delicious and on top of that its so healthy. No other place in town offers this type of menu and it is not to be missed. The atmosphere and location are just like the food--unique and beautiful! You can eat indoors, in a library area (Air room) that has floor to ceiling windows, or outside on the patio. I utilize the online ordering and ordering at the self serve kiosk is so easy. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Tucked into what looks like a commercial/office building, you could pass this place a million times and have no idea it's there.  But YUM you'll be glad you DO know it's there!

Attached to a yoga studio, the cafe is bright and peaceful. You may wonder, when you first walk in, and see a pile of shoes by the door and notice people wandering around in socks \"do I have to take my shoes off?!\" The answer is no. (Although you could if you wanted to). 

You order on your own & pay by swiping your credit card on an ipad that's stationed in front of the menus. Your name will then be called & you'll pick up your food at a window. One thing I may suggest trying, if you're with friends but paying separately, is to perhaps make a note in your orders that you're together so hopefully the food will then arrive closer together. (We didn't do this so the first batch of food came out about 5-10 min before the next person's food, which can leave some people feeling uncomfortable starting to eat before everyone at the table has their food.) 

Everything we ordered was delicious - it seemed fresh and healthy, two things you don't always feel like you get when eating out!  The portions are not huge (at least on the bfast & lunch items we got) so if you have a big appetite you may want to order extra. When you pull up the ipad menu there also are small pictures of the food so you have some idea of the size ahead of time.  

Coffee/tea are around the corner from the order station & they're on an \"honor\" system. Take your beverage & put your cash in a cup!  Discount if you bring your own mug to fill... 

The cafe was pleasantly full on a Sunday early afternoon but quiet (soft music & low voices) so easy to hear your friends. It wasn't so busy that you felt rushed or like you needed to get going so someone else could have the table.  A very relaxing spot to grab a tasty bite and catch up!"}
{"text":"I called on a Monday to make sure they were open and got voicemail.  Both of my daughters happened to do the same. All three of us left messages, but we did not hear back, so we went elsewhere.  
That Friday I tried again and this time  I did reach someone.  I mentioned that we'd left several voice messages on Monday and never heard back.  She said they had been too busy to answer the phone.  I asked if they had been too busy Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to return my call.  \"Oh.  We deleted those messages\".  (Do they have so many customers that they have no need for more? I think this showed a disregard for common courtesy and good business practices).
But that experience was actually a foreshadowing of what it's like to eat there.  We sat down at a table and waited. And waited.  Nothing.  So I went up to the kitchen door and asked if I was missing something.  \"Oh. You need to order at the tablet around the corner\".  Hmmm. Maybe there could have been something on the table telling us about that?  So we ordered and when the food was ready, we came to the kitchen door to pick it up. There was no staff present in the dining area during the entire time we were there.  The drive-up at McDonald's provides a more personal experience than this.
The menu is very interesting and shows wonderful creativity, so we were excited to finally eat here.  Unfortunately the food was simply okay, and at ~$13/entree, a bit pricey for \"simply okay\".
(I don't understand comments that mention things like \"all of the staff were very kind\".  What staff? Did we go on a night when they were under-staffed?  If so, then perhaps our experience was not typical. I really do want to be fair)."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if that were possible. Or maybe infinity stars. It's effing delicious.
I have been searching for tasty, flavorful, delicious, vegetarian food and this is it. There are so many options here and I plan on eating my way through the entire menu. 
I ordered the beet and sunflower beet burger which comes with hummus, carmalized onions, avocados and greens. It was a very tasty combination, and I loved the texture. It wasn't your typical meatless burger that was just mush, but the sunflower seeds and crisp greens made such a pleasant bite. It was a bit messy, and difficult to eat with the GB bun - I ended up deconstruction it a bit and just getting each element on my fork in every bit.
I also tried the Sunrise fresh-pressed juice which is orange, apple, carrot, turmeric, lemon and ginger. I've been on a big turmeric-ginger kick and this was one of the better tasting juice combos I've had. It was extremely refreshing and had a bit of a zing.
Definitely, DEFINITELY going back. There are so many different plates, I wish there were more cafes like Surya."}
{"text":"The cultural appropriation here is absolutely wild. They have a Buddha head?? And you're pressured to take your shoes off when you come in. The food is alright at best. I feel like a white suburban yoga wine mom when I come here. I came for the vegan options and but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! I love the decor and the way it's all set up. The food is also very healthy and tastes really good too!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try the food here. I read that it is not a place to take kids. Well, I have 3 of them. So, we had the talk before we left and they were really pretty good. That being said, all of the staff were very kind and accommodating. They brought little glasses for the kids and smaller plates. They were attentive and considerate of my trio. Bonus - the food was awesome. We all loved it. I had the beet burger which was so flavorful. The hummus was great. The veggies were very fresh and tasty. The kids loved the sampler (but my kids will try anything - some kids won't like it). The heavenly date bar was a hit with all the kids. The iced coffee was smooth and perfect. Thank you for your kindness and delicious food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian anywhere in the neighborhood.  Awesome vibe and great yoga too.  Great place to be truly nourished in multiple ways.  In the Agora pavilion which in and of itself is remarkable, Surya is a gem hidden within this first class space.  Ordering is electronic which makes choosing easy.  Payment is by plastic which is easy too.  This will be a staple for us in trying to balance healthy nourishment with easy location and comfort.  Bravo to the creators.  We are fans now."}
{"text":"Been there several times and never disappointed. The personal pizza is phenomenal considering there is no gluten, cheese or meat, actually liked it a lot better than the standard stuff. Desserts are out of this world and the staff is so attentive and welcoming. Love going there!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a neat place for sleepy little Fitchburg! I never would have guessed that such a progressive and creative menu would show up here.

Surya is a vegan cafe attached to a yoga studio with an entire vegan and gluten-free menu. It's quite exciting and interesting. 

I stopped in on a Sunday morning and was there during the \"breakfast\" hours; they have separate menus for each meal, but the hours seem to overlap a bit. 

I ordered the Hearty Bowl (sweet potatoes and black beans with tons of toppings) and WOW was it good. The ordering process was a bit strange and clunky (you order yourself on an iPad) and the food took 20 minutes or so to come out, but it was EXCELLENT when it finally arrived. I also got the cold brew coffee latte, which was also quite tasty. 

The space looked nothing like a strip mall/suburb yoga studio and was decorated with flags, plants, and wall art. 

Overall, I loved the little breakfast I had at Surya and can't wait to try another meal there. Hopefully it's a little less crowded next time I visit so that it doesn't take so long to order and make the food."}
{"text":"Just tried Surya for the first time last night and everything on the menu looked good. They offer a variety of vegan dishes and I love seeing a plant based menu as creative as theirs. I ended up going with the zucchini noodle dish and great fresh juice! The cauliflower sauce was so good, I wish it was socially acceptable to lick the plate. Definitely will be going back especially since I love yoga at Perennial!"}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with some innovative and tasty eats. It's vegan which typically isn't my thing, but I really enjoyed it!"}
