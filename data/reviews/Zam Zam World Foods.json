{"text":"Aslam o aleequm             Good quality of food alhumdullaih with reasonable price and excellent friendly service. I always visit this resto Alhumdullaih"}
{"text":"Grocery shop is good. You get a lot of kinds of meet there.   But the restaurant is okayish. We had a buffet & most of the items were below par. Naans were so hard. and felt like frozen naans reheated."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. The staff is friendly and accommodating to my request! They have vegetarian and vegan options as well.   I would really recommend the Chana Massala as well as the eggplant. I order those dishes with the fresh made Naan and it can feed both myself and my gf for a nice dinner.   They are currently updating the look and feel of the restaurant and store. I usually just get togo from there, but sometime may dine in. More of a togo place for me though...  But look forward to seeing their updates! Good lunch falafel lunch wrap too :D"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great catering. Handled a 200 people party beautifully and even helped cleaning up. This restaurant is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I was just looking for a good restaurant which serves great chicken/lamb on sunday. My expectations were not completely fulfilled but this restaurant has good tasty  1. Chicken Sheesh Khabab (Loved it) 2. Sweet item (kind of indian Rava Kesari) 3. Fresh poor 4. Free Soft Drink 5. Lamb Daal 6. Chicken Curry bit different flavor  7. Mutton Paaya  8. White & Chicken Pulav.. & few more veg & Beef options  Most of the above items tasted good but different from Indian food flavor, most of them may like this.  Althogether i would say all meat lovers should try this (can say for Sunday's). Customer Serving is really good...there are two young girls who were very responsive & polite too"}
{"text":"Sitting at Fattoush for lunch early last week, I picked up a local ethnic newspaper to provide myself some lunchtime reading. There on the front page was an ad for Zam Zam Market, specializing in \"fresh halal meats\".   I thought to myself, in a half-interested kind of way, \"oh, ok. A new Middle Eastern market named after the holy well in Mecca. It looks like Baiz (and Al Haramaine, which is a few doors down from Fattoush) has some new competition in the central Phoenix area.\"   But then underneath a picture of some produce I spotted key words that made my eyes bulge out of my head: \"Our Z-Grill serves nehari, biryani, tikka, goat karahai, seekh kebabs...\". Immediately my mushy brain had to do a quick turnaround in its thought processing. This wasn't a standard Arabic market. These were MY people. Me not having to drive to Mesa or Glendale for Pakistani food? I started drooling at the thought, even though my stomach was about to burst from lunch. And so, I paid my bill and immediately headed over to Zam Zam. I had to see this place for myself. Now.  Zam Zam, like Baiz, is situated in not the greatest of neighborhoods. It's on 40th Street & Coronado, just north of McDowell. My goal for this initial visit was to keenly observe what this place was about. Walking past the cash register, I noticed a bunch of calling cards to Africa (including one awesome looking one called \"African Hero\") and a bunch of random Islamic trinkets.   I then looked to see what was in the freezer section. I spotted kababs. Lots of kababs. Zam Zam apparently makes its own seekh kebabs (skewered ground beef) and shammi kababs (Mughal-style ground beef patties mixed with lentils and other spices), ready for lazy bachelors like me to take home and grill or fry themselves. Holy mother.   Then I spotted little cones of pistachio and mango kulfi (our version of ice cream). A bunch of ready-to-heat Halal dinners (aka. the Muslim version of Swanson's TV dinners), a section stocked with goat meat, meetha paan (rolled betel leaves filled with coconut and other sweet stuff - very much an acquired taste but very popular in Pakistan and northern India),  and the butcher section filled with more fresh meat and chicken, plus more kebabs, etc.   The feeling that South Asia is the dominant force in the market is the dessert section - a couple of trays of baklava, sure, but the main focus is on jalebis (think of them as our version of pretzel-shaped funnel cake, soaked in sweet goopy syrup), ladoos, gulab jamuns, and halva (sweet semolina mixed with cardamom, pistachios, sultana raisins, etc.) - all sweets popular in India and Pakistan and not well-known in the Middle East.  A lot of the food stuffs on the shelves also cater heavily to South Asian cooking - a plethora of Pakistani and Indian spice mixes, chutneys, teas, biscuits, dried lentils, Basmati rice, etc.  They also have bottles of sodas from the homeland - including ThumsUp (a cola), Miranda (orange soda), and Limca (a lemon-lime soda, although sweeter and not as carbonated as something like Sprite or 7-Up).   There's also a small fresh produce area. Some cookware for sale, including karahais (heavy wok-like pots) and tavis (flat pans to cook chapatis on), and randomly, shelves of car oil (?!). Go figure. --- All in all, Zam Zam isn't the greatest market in the world. It's not nearly as buzzing with activity as Baiz. But having a store so close where I can pick up kababs (which I have done and they are good) and kulfi as well all the cooking ingredients I need is an awesome bonus to me.   As for the Z-Grill itself - a small counter to order on with three dinky adjacent tables - I'm going to review that separately.   Right after having another meal there. :)  Zam Zam itself gets 3.7 stars (rounding up to 4)"}
{"text":"I have no expectations when entering this place. I suggest ppl who expect the ambience - this is not your choice. We ordered some poori chole with halwa and my husband tried the goat karahi with rice.  To our amaze the poori chole was a hit. And the goat karahi is so so for the price. But the quantity is enough . Overall I would try occasionally ."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my dear Indian friend.   It was Sunday and I was craving some good Indian food.   He mentioned this place couple of times before and I finally made it there. He warned me that on Sundays they have buffet style food and that I should not have as high expectations as I would if I went on regular day and ordered from the menu. Despite what he said, I wanted some Indian food then and I took a risk and went.   There was four of us that went. We walked in to the restaurant through their convenient grocery store. The restaurant was full of happy faces and that was enough for me to take a seat  and join the happy crowd.   One of the employees warmly  welcomed us in and explained how the buffet works. She was really nice.   They had a lots of options on their buffet and we made sure to try it all. It was a big success. Everything we tried was delicious. Chicken Tikka Masala was awesome! The Naan bread was excellent as well.   My recommendations are to try everything and you won't regret it.   They even came to our table and offer to make us fresh Puri. I am so glad I said yes! It was heavenly.   The ambiance was great. The restaurant was a bit outdated but still great family ambiance.   There it is my friends - you must check this place out!"}
{"text":"Authentic Indian/Pakistani food here! I'm not a big fan of 'American Indian cuisine' which are mainly consist of 'cream' to make food look colorful and lots of 'Indian' restaurants in Phoenix are like that. This is a jem in the area and true spices!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I recently bought Nehari and it was great wih fresh NAAN.   Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Good variety, very friendly staff, reasonable prices. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good quality economical Asian grocery"}
{"text":"If you like Indian food as well as middle eastern or Persian food you must try zam zam. It's Afghanistan/Pakistani restaurant, very authentic abd one of my favourite place.I have lunch there probably once a week. Very well priced  You must try their nehari curry and every dish on their menu, nothing like typical Indian food"}
{"text":"This is a review about the new restaurant, Khyber Halal, which just opened inside ZamZam this week (1/14/2013). The food is a mix of Pakistani and Afghani cuisine, reasonably priced and above all absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend the Mantoo and Chicken Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"LOVED the eggplant, so deicidios and great portion size! Was not a big fan of the lamb, but it was my first time trying lamb and could just be it's a new food for me! Super nice staff and clean location!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good...hot, fresh n tasty. However, their service was a little poor and prices were a bit on the high side. I would still recommend them over other Indian/Paki restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great little shop, take out, catering or eat in. Food was great and service was very nice and helpful.  Enjoy, I did."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food in this little grill tucked inside this fabulous international grocery store. Great kebabs. Superb Naan... Very reasonable especially for the quality of meat that you get. We paid a little extra and got the garlic naan/flat bread which was a square shape. We even got some home to make pizzas... The husband wife combo of cook, hosts etc was a delight... All fresh ingredients. Would go back to try the leg of lamb..."}
{"text":"This place is called Tahura. Had their catered food multiple times and have also eaten in. Trust me, Im from Pakistan and can tell you this is authentic Pakistani food. Best you can get in Phoenix. Their BBQ items are great but so is their nihari. Try their Sunday brunch and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were on the lookout for authentic Middle Eastern food, and not the mainstream familiar most people go for. Our friend was in town from the UAE and we wanted the real deal (We were actually looking for a Ramadan Iftar meal but I don't think anyone serves it in Phoenix). The first place we went was actually closing for Ramadan, but the owner recommended this place. So glad we found it! I wasn't sure at first - they didn't seem interested in helping us order (she answered the phone while we were ordering), they were out of hummus, etc. But eventually, we placed our order and grabbed some drinks from the fridge. I was about 20 minutes or so until we got our food, but from that moment on, I was completely taken into a magical land of glorious food. The authentic rice and goat, the Tandoori melted in your mouth - the cook even brought out one of her favorites at no charge - Beef Masala. The Garlic Naan was buttery, warm and delicious (and I swear she brought out WAY more than one order of Naan). This little hole in the wall is a must visit for authentic Pakistani/Indian food. Don't be intimidated - dive in and try it!"}
{"text":"I just ordered Goat Haleem to go, as soon as I opened the bag to look inside, i was surprised by the size of the contained probably smaller than 5inch in diameter and quite flat. The worst part was there was no goat in the haleem, its suppose to have goat and lentil, mine had only lentils and fewer threads of goat than the ginger garnish they put on the top. I was very disappointed, it cost around $12 but nothing to show for it. At the end of the meal i was still hungry, taste wise also it was not good. May not go back there anymore. There kept me waiting too for around atleast 15-20 mins even though i got there after calling way ahead of time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything is so great! Chicken Handi is a personal favorite. The buffet is greatly priced for the amazing quality of food they have."}
{"text":"My first visit I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala and I wasn't a big fan but my friend got the Chicken Tikka and it was AWESOME, the best I have every had.  So I went back today and this time I got the Boneless Chicken Handi and it was really great.  The naan bread is also excellent. A lot of my friends like the Bryiani quite a lot."}
{"text":"This place has stepped up it's game, completely different then how it was a few years ago, the meat selection is way better, people welcome you when you come in.    kyber halal restaurant (similar to the one on 24th and indian school) is now taking up 1/2 the space of zam zam and the food is awesome, plenty of seating and good service."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Indian Pakistani Afghan he food in the region. The chicken karhi is phenomenal the service is very attentive the presentation of the plates is great. This is a gem that you would never realize when you pass by or look at the place from the outside. I have traveled all over the world and I can say that this is some of the best cleanest and freshest food I have had. Afghani kabob is also delicious."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  They have a functioning Tandoor (clay oven of Pakistani and Indian origin) which they make fresh Naan (flat bread), and I recommend highly the garlic naan with cilantro.  Mix that with a curry of your choice (the goat and chicken tikka are particularly good) and you're in as authentic a Pakistani restaurant as you're going to find in the Valley.    You are going here for the food not so much the ambiance.  Although it has a really good halaal (kosher) butcher shop and international food market attached to it, it is really authentic.  That's what makes this a diamond in the rough.    The owners know the meaning and true essence of hospitality.  Something lacking in most restaurants.  I send EVERYONE and their mom here who likes \"Indian\" food and has never had Pakistani food.  Which is better, and includes beef dishes.  Northern Indian cuisine is similar.  Check it out, and save the travel expenses and stamps on your passport :)"}
{"text":"Yes it doesn't have the best ambiance and not the restaurant with the best flair,but trust me its the best offering you will have on Indian/Pakistani food over here.  I havent had too much of the veggies but not a big fan of what ive had.Its the meats that will have you drooling for more. Leave your health stats at home because the oil quantity will be in your face...but the taste buds rule all the way."}
{"text":"I really don't expect a whole lot when I go to places like these. Someone without a real business plan somehow got a whole boatload of money and opened up a little store. I can name a dozen of these hole-in-the-wall, ethnic food restaurant grocery stores. Some of them do it real well (Haji Baba and Princess), others seem to have a little trouble (I-Mart).  Zam Zam certainly isn't a place that I would recommend buying your grocery.The meat appears to be a day or two old sometimes, and it just left out overnight sometimes. You can tell by the way the meat looks, its super obvious. Besides all that, I'm not exactly the kind of person that will go out of my way to buy 'zabiha' meat instead of grocery store meat. The rest of the stuff is pretty much as you'd expect. Plenty of spices, drinks, and arabic breads to fulfill your needs. But still, the meat isn't of the highest quality.  Customer service? What customer service? You must not have been to many of these types of places. Don't expect customer service at these places.  It sounds ridiculous that I'm giving this place 4 stars, and it actually is somewhat crazy. Zam Zam makes some AMAZING naan. I wasn't even expecting it, but the naan is simply amazing. At $1.50 its a little pricey, but you get quite a large piece. I don't think its cheaper anywhere else in the valley (or maybe the western US)? I've eating naan at plenty of revered Indo-Pak restaurants on the west coast and I must say I am absolutely in love with the naan. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for their samosas which are a little too salty for my taste. The lack of a sweet chutney certainly doesn't help, and the cilantro chutney is a little too far from classic for my taste. I haven't tried anything besides the naan and samosas, so I can't say too much about those. But even if the other food is only semi decent, the naan will definitely make up for it.  I might be wrong, but the naan might be from heaven."}
{"text":"My Pakistani colleague took me here for lunch and it was just terrific.  They have both an a la carte menu and a lunchtime buffet.    The buffet has basmati rice, a kind of chicken korma kind of thing, chana dal, fried potatoes and it came with a hubcap-sized piece of fresh naan, hand delivered to the table.  All you can eat for $5.99.    The atmosphere is basic - much like Baiz Market, it's a market that happens to have a small food area, not a proper restaurant per se.  I love these kind of places but it's not exactly a date restaurant in case that's what you're looking for.   What's not to like?  Cheap, delicious, quick and friendly.  Update: Went back for a casual dinner and ordered from the a la carte menu.  It took about 25 minutes which had us wondering but when the food was served we realized why - every single thing had been made to order, down to the rice.  It's like going to your Pakistani grandma's house for dinner.  Super-fresh, delicious and very friendly service.  Highly recommended for foodies who want authentic Indian/Pakistani food."}
{"text":"The Best Chicken Tikka in the Phoenix Valley. I try to go almost every week there. People are nice, food is great, price is very affordable. They have also improved the ambience. Not the best, but no complains. Guys, if you visit there, dont forget to try the Chicken Tikka (legs) there. My advice to the owners is: Keep up the good work and maintain the food and restaurant quality."}
{"text":"I expected little from this place on every other front but food, and I would rate everything else higher than their food. The poor customer service, meat that clearly looked like it has seen better days, slow service - all beat the food! We ordered the Lamb Biryani which was dry, bland and flavourless. The Chicken Tikka Kebab which came in much later (although we ordered them together!) brought us no respite from the bad food - the meat was chewy and the marinade tasteless!  Two stars because I took a parcel of haleem during Ramazan a month ago which was yummy and their naan was one of the better ones that I have ever had. I would give this place another chance, only because I have a soft spot for hole in the wall places and this could have been one of their bad days."}
{"text":"Been looking for about ten years for decent Indian food and we finally found it! Didn't eat in. Did take out instead and it was excellent! This stuff is legit."}
{"text":"this review is all about the sunday buffet. in the course of writing this review i'm certain that i will convince myself to go tomorrow.  zam zam is family run, and it's completely wonderful. they only do buffet on sundays so as not to have to serve, you know, buffet food. i think it's $16 but that represents a clear economic win for anyone who eats even one plate.  the dining area of the restaurant is dated and a little shabby, but it feels like home. a few other reviewers have mentioned what a family atmosphere you feel here - i'm with you. great vibes.   the food is just killer. i've seen my brother eat 10 pieces of their grilled chicken tikka. my mouth is watering as i'm typing this sentence. beef nihari on point. fresh hot naan until you canaan't. i can't believe you get to eat as much as you want at this place!!! what a time to be alive  4 stars since i can only go on sundays because i'm spoiled by the buffet portions  robbo"}
{"text":"Good place for buying meat, spices, biryani and kebabs. Don't expect high standards of customer service (read: greeting, asking if you found everything OK, if you need anything else, etc.), it's a no-frills shopping place for those looking for Indian/ Pakistani foods.   I can vouch for their biryani, having had it several times. It's flavorful and enough for one hungry man. They skimp on the meat, though, but that has been my experience at every biryani place I have been to. The kebabs are good, and come with two pieces of nan, though sometimes they can be a hit or miss, as I found out with my fave shish kabob. One day it was out of this world lip smackingly good, and the other day it was so bland and tasteless that I was sure I had gone to the wrong store!  I wouldn't do my veggies shopping here, because whenever I've been here (usually on Fridays), the shelves have held droopy greens and other veggies. The spice collection though is plentiful. They have a whole range of whole and powdered spices, including a bunch of Shaan's wonderful masalas. They also have an assortment of lentils, flour, frozen stuff like samosas, naans, rotis and fresh meat and chicken. A small seating area means you can devour the delicious stuff from their kitchen---both vegetarian and non-vegetarian--piping hot!"}
