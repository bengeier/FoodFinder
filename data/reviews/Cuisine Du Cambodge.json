{"text":"A nondescript hole in the wall in a strip of Lorain full of auto repair shops, tattoo parlors and burner cell phone vendors, this is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Cleveland and certainly my favorite takeout.  The food is objectively awesome and totally addictive.   Prices are reasonable and the portions are extremely generous, so plan to have leftovers (and to be horrified by how heavy your order is if you're indecisive).  The \"lot\" accommodates 2 cars and I'm not sure it's even intended as such, but you can usually find street parking nearby.  It is cash only, so come prepared.    Hadn't had Cambodian prior to eating here-- the food is like a 70 % Thai  30 % Vietnamese mashup with a balance of salty, savory, sweet, cooked and fresh.  Much more flavorful and a little bit funkier (but frankly also less photogenic) than either of those cuisines.  The noodle dishes are their strong suit and comprise the majority of the menu-- an overwhelming list of similar sounding iterations on a theme that superficially resemble pad Thai, but have surprisingly distinct flavor profiles.   A quick rundown of some highlights:   - The creamy shrimp rolls are a guilty pleasure-- like cigar-shaped shrimp crab rangoon in spring roll wrappers - The fresh spring rolls (D/D1) are especially good and herb heavy - Mee Krolaa (#28) is not stir fried so the noodles are a bit more al dente-- tossed w a sweeter soy-based sauce, lots of pickled vegetables, ground peanuts and dried shrimp that lends a salty funk - Chha Bun Kari Kroup Muk (#39) Stir fried vermicelli with a curry based sauce and every meat known to mankind. The chicken patties are super lemongrassy and totally addictive and the thick rectangles of homemade tofu are fried to a perfect chew.  - Khmer chili kuy tiev chha (#66) Essentially a well executed version of Americanized tomato paste-based pad Thai.  - Kuy tiev chha tek trey phèm (#67-73) Looks like pad Thai, but stir fried in a sweet soy-based sauce. Probably the least flavorful of the bunch.  - Kuy tiev chha chou èm (#74-80) Soy based sauce but more balanced with some tang, plentiful chiffonade of herbs on top.  - Banh sougnh (#108a-113) Similar to bun with the usual vegetable toppings, sliced spring rolls and fish sauce to pour over but made with thicker round rice noodles.  Topped with stir fried meat and onion in a coconuty sauce.  Weird, but delightfully addictive.   A few caveats: The banh sougnh noodles are rarely cooked perfectly-- usually a bit too soft or too firm, the basil fried rice is forgettable, Mee chha a bit weird, and chicken lemon grass is a bit bland. The spice ratings mean business-- the hue beef soup has so much chili that it turns the noodles a sort of pepto bismol pink and tastes like lava."}
{"text":"WE ARE OBSESSED WITH THIS PLACE!    We have been coming here for years, way back to when the original owners of Phnom Penh (which now own Cuisine Du Cambodia) were here.  We stayed with this location during the ownership change and for a time continued to go to Phnom Penh, as that is what we were most familiar with.  We heard that the original owners were back and had re-opened the restaurant on Lorian rd. and W 130th so we came back!  WOW!!!  This place is so much better!  The portions are LITERALLY double the size of what you get at Phnom Penh and the prices are the same or less.  My husband and I usually order 2 or 3 dishes and eat them \"family style\" rather than having to choose only one dish.  You get so much food that we both eat until we are ready to explode and still have enough leftovers to bring home and eat one or two more times!   We bring a cooler filled with beer (as beer is the perfect compliment to the spicy cuisine).  We order everything HOT but you can order according to your spice preferences...although some of the dishes lend themselves to being enjoyed spicy and just simply do not translate well otherwise (in our opinion).    Our favorites are:  Beef Hue Soup, Egg Rolls, Pork Pad Thai HOT, #39 HOT, and Asian Basil Combination Fried Rice HOT.  Woo hoo!!!!  But, you probably cannot go wrong with any of the dishes because everything is fresh and authentic and wonderful.  You must try it!!!  You may end up addicted to the food like we are!"}
{"text":"I have been eating the egg noodle wanton soup lately. I ask them to add bok choi to it and they do so without complaint.  The new special of sour chili noodles is good too. The servings are pretty large.   If you want vegetarian dishes here you have to specify vegetarian. Cambodian, Thai and Vietnamese cuisines are based on fish sauce, a rather smelly, salty liquid left over from fermenting fish.  It is a bit naive to assume that a cuisine based on fish sauce will not contain fish sauce. Like ordering onion soup in a French restaurant and assuming the broth is made of only onions.   My wife is a vegetarian and they make her food vegetarian but we specify that they use soy sauce instead. Not a problem."}
{"text":"The deluxe spring rolls are totally worth it!  They were very fresh with lots of shrimp and beef. The fantasy stew (147) was wonderful on a cold day. The noodles (71) were perfectly spicy at a medium level. The smoothies are larger than you'd think at $2.50, the jack fruit one had fruit pulp in it.  This is going to become a regular stop."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fresh made-to-order food, friendly employees, great food, wonderful serving sizes, oh and the price isn't bad either!  Be sure to try one of their home made egg rolls with their own hom made dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would.  I ordered the small Hue Beef Soup for take out.  When I pulled up in my German car, the owner told me I needed to get a large.  I was a little annoyed because it was obvious he was taking advantage of me.  He never said over the phone there was a size minimum.  But I have been seeking good Asian for years so I agreed.  If the food was good I was going to have leftovers.  Well I was wrong...it was horrible!!  Tasted like hot dirty dishwater!  So my large soup that I was forced to buy went into the garbage.  I get some people giving this place 5 stars who haven't tried places outside OH.  But I am shocked that those who have had Asian food in coastal states or big cities like Chicago, LA, etc would rank this place so high...really?!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the very best I have found for an exotic meal in Cleveland and has some of the most delicious food I have ever eaten! It is a family owned and operated restaurant, and it is easy to tell the food has been prepared with love. The flavors are complex, but also delicate and perfectly balanced and the portions are generous. This place is very cozy and intimate and the family makes you feel as though you are a guest in their home. It is a nice quite place where you can have a conversation over a great meal and not feel rushed, maybe even lose track of time."}
{"text":"My husband and I had never tried Cambodian cuisine, but according to all the positive Yelp reviews on the Cuisine Du Cambodge Restaurant,  we figured it would be a great place to start. And it did not disappoint!  We went on a Thursday night and when we arrived, there were three other small parties in the small dining room. The menu was quite large and daunting, but don't let that deter you. We started with the largest Sampler Platter, all the food was delicious, but we wish we realized it was ALL fried! For a main meal, we ordered #119 Chicken Coconut Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt, which came in a creamy sauce with a large portion of chicken and vegetables. And #39, which came with an assortment of chicken, shrimp, and tofu, mixed with vermicelli. This also had amazing flavors. The portions were huge, since we split two main entrees, and even had leftovers for the next night's dinner.   Don't let the outside appearance of the restaurant fool you, the food is amazing. Plus the restaurant is BYOB, which they provide a wine opener and glasses. We would definitely recommend this place and cannot wait to go back and try different dishes. This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Hands down: the best restaurant in all of Cleveland. The folks at the restaurant know what you want and they deliver. Every dish we've had is absolutely top-notch. The delicate spring rolls are probably the best dish in the entire world. Pitch perfect. Sometimes the service is a tad on the slow side, but that's because your food is being hand-prepared in a small kitchen between the dining area and the restrooms. The servers are always very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Everything about the food is great.  The spice level, freshness, taste, and the temperature of the food.  The friendly waitress helped out a lot while trying to pick a dish, and was very delightful to talk to.    The service and food were spot on.  I look forward to coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Do not be intimidated by the location or the dining room! I would say this place is best for takeout.   That being said, I have never had anything from here that was not wholeheartedly delicious. I have had: -chicken pad thai; I've tried all levels of spice (get spicy). complete with sautéed onions, peanuts, lemongrass, and rice noodles. Serves 2 people for 3 or so meals. -homemade chicken wings; thick but surprisingly airy, crispy breading -bubble tea. I had mango. It was spectacular and not made from an icky mix. -stuffed chicken wings; chicken wings stuffed with a lemongrass/basil mixture... delicious       -- wonton soup; the best wonton soup I have ever had, wontons, scallions, strips of pork -chicken kuy tiev chha; a sort of spaghetti dish with assorted vegetables in a tasty coconut sauce.. And for the dish I always get... -Chha kreoung mass prowt with chicken. Que singing angels. Tender chicken, spicy (as in nasal clearing capacity) sauce, ground peanuts, peppers, and amazing rice.   I love this place! I have been to Phnom Penh on 25th and can honestly say that their dishes don't even compare. I am slowly working my way through ordering everything on their menu, and this is the first restaurant I have ever wanted to make that accomplishment with- it's that good.   Cuisine du Cambodge, how I love thee. It's rather embarrassing how often I go there, and I have a Cuisine du Cambodge dish for every ailment I'm suffering:  Have a cold and don't want chicken noodle? Get wonton soup (homemade wontons, fresh scallions, strips of pork in a robust broth) Have a stuffy nose or sinus infection? Get chicken pad thai (specify you want spicy) or chha kreoung mass prowt. Have a 95 degree day in Cleveland and are sweating your balls off? Get bubble tea for a refreshing treat."}
{"text":"I think I'll go back here. The place isn't fancy, but I think the food was good. Never been to a Cambodian restaurant before, this my first experience wasn't bad. Actually I went there twice, and on both occasions I was satisfied."}
{"text":"I'd never tried Cambodian food before but this place was incredible.  We drove past it the first time, and it seemed very small and no-frills for a 5-star Yelp rating, so I was a bit skeptical at first. The place was packed with people though, which was a good sign.  Ordered four different noodle dishes and got humongous portions, with each one having its own distinct flavor. I ate so much I thought my stomach would hurt. The only waiter, who I presumed was the owner, was extremely friendly and courteous and even though the place looked like a shack, it was really worth the trip.  Wasn't a fan of Cleveland, but might come back just for the Cambodian food."}
{"text":"I love it here.  I live nearby so order from here more than anywhere else and am always happy.  Owners are great and really friendly and the prices are super for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I'll admit I've always had a negative prejudice against Cambodian food for no good reason. However, as time has passed, I've grown to love Thai, Indian, Vietnamese, and other Asian foods, so I figured it was time to try this place.  Our party of 3 arrived at 8:30 on a Tuesday. There was a VERY large party (perhaps 15 people) at the front 2 tables. I think because of this, we stood in the doorway waiting to be seated for about 5 to 8 minutes. Kind of a bummer, but no biggie. The menu was rather large and everything sounded appetizing. I settled on a \"delicate rice paper roll\" which was a \"fresh roll\" loaded with light vegetables and wrapped in a thin rice wrap. My wife had the spring roll, and our friend had the egg roll. All of the rolls were EXCELLENT.   My friend then had the beef rice noodle soup and it was fantastic as well. For our main courses I had Beef Chha Kroeung which was beef in a thick brown sauce with onions, green peppers, and peanuts on the top. My wife had Shrimp Chha Kroeung Ma Rass Prowt which was a lighter, coconut-cream based sauce. It was also very good. My friend had Beef Loc Lac with special fried rice. This dish was simply delicious and visually beautiful. It was a lot like a teriyaki but better! The special fried rice wasn't my bag, but my friend enjoyed it.  All in all, the food was outstanding. I only gave it 4 stars because of our wait before being seated and I also thought that the spice options were rather tame for asian food. Both my friend and I ordered our dishes \"hot\" and neither was very spicy. The portions are rather large, so be ready to eat. Another BIG plus to going here is that it is BYOB which makes for a very reasonably priced gourmet meal.   Enjoy!  Tom"}
{"text":"Great food!  I got #41 I believe, second page, last item about the middle of the page.  It was a Tek Phek Kreoung something or other, I can't remember the name.    The meal was great, hot, fresh, big, and a great price.  I got it with chicken.  Also tried the fried tofu and the shrimp rolls as appetizers and they were very very good.  Mango smoothie was awesome by the way.  I will be back to this place.  Waiter (I think owner) was very good, attentive, nice, cracked a couple of jokes.    It may look a little funky and parking is a little funny as in, hop the curb and park in front or park on a side residential street, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Vegetarians and vegan take warning.  We were told after takeout was paid for and given to us that it had a little bit of fish sauce on some of the dishes. This was after i asked if certain dishes were vegetarian.   Refund wasn't offered and we were told at least we will know for next time. Guess what? There won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Good amount of food. Cost performance is great and food is ver tasty!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing.  I studied abroad in Asia and it is as good as it gets.  The owners are SO NICE, someone will definitely come out and talk to you.  It's a quiet, intimate environment.  I've had spicy soup (drank several liters of water to accompany) as well as the noodle dishes and some of the appetizers.  I'm convinced that there can't be anything bad on the menu.  Very affordable!!"}
{"text":"This restauant is very similar food to the place that was there before it, but even better!  I would say this is on the must-have list for Asian cuisine!  Don't dine in the area without trying here.  All the menu items are great!"}
{"text":"Though I have passed this restaurant for years, I didn't eat there until this summer. And boy am I sad I missed out all that time.  Formerly Phnom Pehn, it has been renamed,but I believe the chef is the same.  I love them for pho and the fried tofu is the best.  Generous portions for the prices.  I recently tried the garlic and black pepper shrimp and it was crispy, spicy and delicious.  Everyone is very friendly when I arrive, but I usually order take out which is always great. Go go go!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food, helpful (family) staff, and HUGE portions.  This was our first visit but we intend to go back to taste more dishes!  Always nice to find good Asian food (no 1-10 scales here!) in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I came here with kids on July 5th. We ordered Pho and fresh fruit smoothies. Very happy with the food and service. My kids like the smoothies so much that we had to go back again on the return trip. My 5yr old forgot her baby blanket the 1st time we were there. They saved it until we went back the 2nd time. Met with owner, owner's wife and their daughters. They are very kind people. Best wish! Hope to eat there again next time."}
{"text":"We have been following Mang and Eng since 1991 when they were on Madison near 117th.  Since moving away (2004) we have never found anything like their place...out here on the Pacific Rim.  The food is fantastic and the people are very friendly.  5 Stars (if there were more they'd get em)"}
{"text":"Great food and low prices. Huge selection makes your decision difficult so ask the server for suggestions, very helpful. Not much parking on site but plenty in the area."}
{"text":"How can this place get a decent review? We ordered takeout and it took them an hour and 15 to complete the order. Also, they don't like to answer their phone and they don't have an answering machine. Patronizing places like this just encourages bad service and discourages good restaurants from opening."}
{"text":"Seriously theee best food!! Would recommend it in a heartbeat! Fast and friendly people! 5stars is underestimating!"}
{"text":"Excellent Cambodian food!   I especially like the Kuy Tiev Chha noodles.   Even good cold the next day"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Quite possibly my most favorite asian cuisine spot."}
{"text":"Mindblowingly great food. Everything is delicious. The combo soup is my favorite, but everything I've ordered has been outstanding. My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and damn is this place fantastic! I had the chef's special, my son had a pad thai, and my wife had a vermicelli bowl. The chef was very very friendly and he was the only one in the restaurant at the time. We were all very very happy. Will be coming back many many times."}
{"text":"Outstanding Cambodian  Cusine. Owner, and sometimes his wife,  does the cooking. Extensive Menu. Owner is the waiter and he is quite friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. Food is delicious! I tried # 108A Yum!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside - or the inside - but the food is great.  I had the special, spicy khmer ginger noodles and it was fantastic. Service was very prompt and courteous and the prices are great."}
{"text":"#47 was great for me, lots of noodles, brocolli, carrots, onions, beef - a good mix. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"I can't send a picture because it was so good and I ate it!!! Service. Great. People. So very nice. Food?!?! Phenomenal!!!! Thank you for a great great meal. I'll be back again. SOON."}
{"text":"The food was better than I could have expected. Large portions considering the prices. Only a few signature items that were over $10. The menu was massive and overwhelming but if everything else is as good as what I had this time I'll be able to come back hundreds of times and try something new every time. I had a traditional khmer pan fried noodle dish and a spring roll. The noodles were delicate and fried perfectly. The sauce was flavorful without being overpowering and the meats in the combination version I got were all very good, especially the beef. The spring roll I ordered was crispy on the outside with slightly crisp yet tender veggies on the inside and a wonderful sweet sauce on the side. Also try the French coffee with condensed milk."}
{"text":"A lot of Asian carry-out restaurants have the distinct smell of old fryer grease.  Not this place.  This is the closest I've had to authentic Far East in the states even though I haven't been to Cambodia. Food is amazing (loved Bangh Soungh chicken), pork is legit and Mang helped point out some other favorites.  $20 for two will buy you food for days. Tell your friends."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant ten stars, I would.  Going back 20 years, I ate at the same place when it was Phnom Penh.  I was very glad to see it open back up under a different name.  Nothing has changed.  The spartan decor, the cash-only, the bring your own beer/wine. And more importantly nothing has changed with the awesome flavors, made with the freshest of ingrediants, for some of the best asian food you will ever have in any city, served at such a reasonable price you will feel a little guilty. I am actually glad I do not live closer to this place, as I think I would want to get carryout every other night!  If you love asian food, do not pass this by...just hit an ATM and a beer and wine store first!"}
{"text":"i'll take other yelpers at their word that this is the best cambodian in cleveland but if that's the case, the bar is not very high. serviceable at best with reasonable prices. the pho with sliced beef came out well done (should be pink) and the chef's signature dish noodles we ordered came with some super dried out chunks of chicken that even the tangy sauce couldn't moisten.   and the delicate rice paper rolls were 90% vermicelli inside, with one limp piece of lettuce and an anemic shrimp cleaved in half.   still: cambodian in cleveland? whuddathunk?"}
{"text":"Looks are not so good from outside. But don't worry!!!! The food was good and also a great deal!!!!!! I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Get takeout from here because the food is ok but the restaurant is not very pleasant and the server has an interesting sense of humor (maybe other people would get it but not us) We both had stomachache after eating here so we will not be back but the food tasted good so if you are craving asian food... do it... under your own risk. It is also not a pleasant area to be around so I will not recommend taking outoftowners here."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to for Cambodian food. We've gotten takeout from Cusine Du Cambodge a few times now, and we haven't gone back to Phnom Penh since. Everything is fresh, not overly greasy, hot, and the portions are huge. Inexpensive (unless you're like me and order the noodle dish with 2,475 different things in it). Flavorful and delicious. Casual and comfortable. If you like Thai or Vietnamese but haven't ventured into Cambodian territory, give this a try and you will be extremely happy."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my absolute favorite places for Asian Cuisine! The owners are super friendly and the food is out of this world fantastic. I think of myself as lucky to have such a great place so close to work. This will allow me to try all the items on the menu!  This restaurant only seats about 20-25 people at max but as we all know those usually mean the best cuisine! The wait is never long and the cinnamon broth in the Pho really packs a flavor punch!"}
{"text":"First visit today and I am definitely visiting again to try more dishes!  It was really cold and I was craving some authentic pho (moved here from Chicago so I was spoiled) and read about Cuisine du Cambodge on yelp. We were around the area, so on we went! I must say, I am really glad we did pay this place a visit! :D They have an extensive menu and because there weren't any pictures on the menu, it was quite hard to figure out what was what (I like places with pictures of food on their menu).   Anyways, the waiter was super friendly and suggested we get Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt, so we got the seafood with steamed rice. We didn't know how spicy the 'hot' option would be, so went with regular. I would get 'hot' next time though. The dish was just.. awesome! Really tender pieces of squid, green pepper and shrimp all danced in a coconut cream sauce. It was sort of like Thai curry but different.  Definitely something to try again :)  We also ordered the house special pho with tendon (extra $1.50). I would say pho...wasn't as good as what I'd get back home. The broth was a bit too greasy for my taste but also very rich which I did like. Rice noodles were a little thicker than I'm used to but the tendon and beef pieces were awesome.  Oh, I wouldn't want to forget the rice paper rolls. They were fresh, chewy and a good size. Definitely one of the best I've had. :)  All in all, I'd say I found a restaurant I wouldn't mind driving 25 minutes to, and will definitely be back in the near future.   Though, if only there was a good parking lot for the restaurant... One would have to park in the street since we didn't find any other places to park."}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent. HOWEVER, they have now reverted to a frustrating policy of CASH ONLY.  A sign on the door says \"....unable to process cards at this time\". When I asked when they are getting the card reader fixed I was told they were not getting it fixed and staying cash only.   If you don't have cash you have to walk across the street to the CVS and use the ATM. The $3 ATM fee was their tip. I will be hard pressed to return."}
{"text":"This is a place where you know you are going to get the best ethnic food in the city, and that is probably the only reason why you will go there.   The neighborhood is shady after sunset, the place is small, there is only street parking, waitress is working on her computer in between breaks, the lights in the back give it an ambiance of a cheap strip club, and the furniture is not what I call classy.   Once you take all these things out of the way and focus on the following, it is the best place to eat Cambodian food. The neighborhood is shady looking but that helps because the cops are around, small places are nice as you get personal attention, waitress is working on the computer but boy she can multitask, the lights are good enough to show you the way to the clean restroom, and the furniture is not classy but serves the purpose.   Now to the important part: FOOD. It is hands down the best Cambodian food I have ever had in my life. It is tasty, portion sizes are large and always feels freshly prepared.   I will recommend it to anyone looking for take out or just sit in."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly staff. Affordable prices. Gigantic serving sizes. Go. Enjoy. Go again. Never remember what you've ordered previously because there's a zillion choices on the menu. Panic internally because how are you ever going to try it all? Bring others."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, large menu has something for everyone. Try the tofu!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! I think maybe better than the original Phnom Penh at the same location. No frills Cambodian food. Terrible parking. I went for takeout and had to wait awhile. So worth it. The egg rolls were awesome, real and homemade with big chunks of meat and great spice. The house khmer bun was fantastic. Pork basil fried rice and veggie pad thai with tofu were tasty too. After dinner for two we have enough left over for four more servings, no joke. Sorry, but Thai Hut and Thai Kitchen in Lakewood can't hang with this place. One last thing, the price is right! I think we found our new go to place for thai!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding!  Friendly people and exceptional food. The menu is so widely varied that there will surely be something for even the most novice diner to enjoy.  Their soups are good. I get the Huir Tui. And also be sure to try the rice paper rolls."}
{"text":"I was so happy that the original owners of Phnom Phenh (back in the 90's) were reopening a restaurant in there old location. I grew up down the street from there and couldn't wait to get my hands on some of their Pad Thai. It was just as yummy as I remember! You have to try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"DynOmite.  Delicious and the owners are super involved and friendly.  I had a great affordable meal for myself.  I will return when I'm back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Love authentic mom and pop places where the food is real, inexpensive and lots of it. I went here with a coworker. We split a soup and an entree. We ate until stuffed and still had two meals to take home. Fantastic. I will be back. The only complaints: I go to Cambodian for authentic and hot/spicy. I ordered the hot bun bo hue soup. It was not hot. My nose didn't run. Unlike the one at Siam Cafe where you cough and the chili oil floats on the surface. And though I eat habanero and ghost pepper sauces, at Phnom Penh, I order medium because the hot is painful. I would like more heat. They also don't have the wonderful stuffed chicken wings."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  I had #122 and it was phenomenal.  The sea food came in large pieces and was very tender"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. The food is amazing, and the service is amazing as well. It is also quite the value as you get a ton of food for your dollar. I have been here more times than I can count and there are a few dishes that I always come back to; first and foremost is the Chha Kroeung Ma Rass Prowt (#119-#123): this is a very \"saucy\" dish, and I simply can't stop eating it. Rice is served on the side. Next is the (#147): I forget what this is called but it's a giant bowl of soup that could be likened to phó, except that this is in more of a red broth. Rice is served on the side with this as well. Last but not least, my favorite noodle dish is the House Khmer Bun (#23A): this is listed as a salad, but apart from some lettuce on the bottom it's not really a salad at all. It is an extremely delicious noodle dish topped with chopped up spring rolls and whatever meat you order. It comes with a sort of sweet and sour sauce that you pour over the top of the dish. If I had to recommend just one thing, this would be it. I've posted delicious pictures of these dishes for you as well!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much, but it is EXCELLENT! They use quality ingredients in their homemade soup stock. The distinct flavors in their food really stand out. It's great, don't let no delivery and limited parking turn you off, it's worth going and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love the food here! The decor leaves a lot to be desired, but we usually get takeout anyway. When we do dine in, the service is friendly, attentive, and efficient. I love most of the noodle dishes, though a few have too much of a tomato/ketchup flavor for me, and I'm a fan of the rice paper rolls. The dishes that feature spicy basil are always my favorites! And in the winter, I love their soups."}
{"text":"In town for just a few days and what a find. Great food at very reasonable price. Had 119. Enough for 2 people. Will be back many times. Don't be concerned with size and looks of building."}
{"text":"Friendly, informal service made me feel comfortable & welcome.  The menu offers a lot with fair descriptions. Vietnamese & thai are 2 of my favorite styles of food-Cuisine didn't disappoint!  A light cambodian chicken salad was first course-shredded cabbage in a sweet/spicy vinegar topped with chicken slices & ground peanuts. This was a smart choice to keep on the table as the next courses were quite spicy!  I had pho next,  which was pretty standard but still tasty! Dinner was Chha yeoung ma rass prowt (combination meat& seafood) and beef phlear. The first was piping hot and comparable to a thai red curry dish. The spice & coconut flavors were great.  The phlear was a new experience  & was very good.  Citrus-y with basil, this plate was cooler ( both seasonwise & temperature) than the first, but instead of just white rice, it was accompanied by a delicious fried rice. The phlear is only offered on the weekends,  so be sure to take advantage of that! After all this, our bill wasn't even $40!! So the place is small with not the best decor or parking, but if those are the slight drawbacks to enjoying really wonderful food at very reasonable prices...count me in for repeat visits!"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here Saturday night.    First of all, this place from the outside is very underwhelming, as well as the inside of the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.  That being said, you are coming here for an authentic meal, not to be wowed by a fancy foyer and cool looking art on the walls. Note - This is a BYOB (savings!)  The food here is as authentic as being guests in a Cambodian families home.  It's a small mom and pop restaurant, with a very extensive menu.   It's entirely run by a family, from the Mom making the meals to the daughters serving you while their Dad oversees things.  My friend Jane and I both had the Combination Coconut Chicken, Beef and Shrimp Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt.  It was very fresh and tasty.  I had them prepare it medium spice, which is definitely tempered to a midwestern palate.  If you are looking for an Asian Spice level of medium just mention it when you order and they will oblige.  My wife had the Chna Bun Kari, which she also enjoyed very much.  The 4th member of our table had the special (the name escapes me) which again, he said was excellent.   The portions are quite large so keep that in mind while considering an appetizer or dessert.    Overall I highly recommend supporting this local restaurant that is both priced competitively, and an excellent quality."}
{"text":"Yes!! Four stars for my first try here. My friends have raved about this place.  Husband and I ordered this out after returning from a long trip. We anticipated that there might be a wait in restaurant, so we called in an order. As others have noted, it's family run and the service reflects that.  The food:  We ordered the #36, fresh papaya salad with fried rice. It is soooo plentiful. The papaya salad is refreshing but savory at the same time. There is a taste of seafood, possibly from the shrimp and other ingredients. At first, I wasn't anticipating the savory flavor, but as I adapted to it, I really liked it. The amount of fried rice that comes with it is huge!! Order this early - they tend to run out of papaya salad and they only make it on the weekend.   We also got #42, the stir fried eggplant. MMM. I love eggplant! It had a lot of good flavor and a bit of seafood and meat to give it some texture.   Then finally, we had the #123, combination chha kreoung ma rasa prowt. Love the lemongrass and flavor in this curry-like dish. All very fresh ingredients.  Overall, fresh, flavorful and well made. We love our Cambodian food. Highly recommend this place over all other Cambodian food wannabes."}
{"text":"We went here thksgvg wkend an indicator should have been no one else was here. Spring roll was burnt stuffed w/ questionable ingredients. Soup for 2 was not good and we were not provided with a ladle. Other items ordered were not favorable and could not have incl the mentioned ingredients (lemon grass, basil, just to mention a few).  Service was poor, had to ask for straws and server seem bothered by our request, as she preferred to be on her computer."}
{"text":"Fresh lemonade tastes like a mojito, sooo delicious. Egg and rice noodle combo is so good, lots of food so bring an apatite. Pad Thai is amazing"}
{"text":"It is a nice place, and the food is in good quantity, however, it is really sweet for me . I order fried rice ...   For those who like sweet, this is a nice place to go, but I, personally will not go back again"}
{"text":"It was a regular Friday night, around 8PM...  First impression- it looked pretty low-key and small from the outside. And yes, after walking inside, it was indeed small and packed. I'm not sure how packed it usually is but from reading the other reviews, apparently this is pretty common.   We were seated pretty promptly and things seemed to be going well. I think there was only one person working as a waitress - she was nice, but it looked like she was tired... and probably overworked. This is a family owned place and I think her parents run it. Anyways, she was nice. We went off her recommendations.   We started off with some appetizers. Spring roll, rice paper roll, and fried tofu. Everything tasted great. I especially thought the spring roll was delicious. Unfortunately though... waited close to an hour for the appetizers!! And the waitress forgot about one of them. We basically got the appetizers at the same time as main meal. Which.... kind of defeats the purpose of getting appetizers :( I don't think it was the waitress's fault... it was busy but still...!! That being said, it's possible that I may pass on the appetizers next time, if it's super busy. But if you decide to go with some appetizers, the spring roll is awesome and if it's not so busy, definitely go for it.  As for the main meals, we got the 74 (penh vegetable kuy tiev chha) and the 119 (chicken chha kreoung). Both are pretty good options if you want to try something authentic/cambodian. Overall, this is a great place for vegetarians! Speaking of which, the spring roll has chicken in it... so if you're not a carnivore, stay away. Also, my friend and I were both accustomed to spicy food - and both went with a medium spice level and were content. Not too spicy by any means but just enough to still appreciate the food's taste with a kick.  Overall, I would have given this more than 3 stars EASILY but with the wait and primarily the appetizers fail...it wouldn't be justified. If I wanted the appetizers at the same time as the main meal, I wouldn't have cared but in this case and pretty much every case, I like to have the appetizers before the main meal! That kind of represents poor service :(  Anyways, will I come back???...of course! Prices are very reasonable, on the more inexpensive side which is great if you're a broke med student. The food is good, honestly, but I have to always consider restaurant service etiquette when reviewing restaurants which is why I'm not giving it a 4 or 5. And ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS, support small business and family owned restaurants! If/when I do come back, I'll update my review...  If you're going to get anything from this rant: Try it out! By the way, you'll likely have to park nearby on a side street (very easy to do)... I think there are about 3-4 spots in front, and that's all."}
{"text":"little family owned cambodian/viet restaurant. my friends got the omelete which was yummy. something different they offered were the small soups for under $4 which was perfect for a cold winter day and allowed me to order something else instead of just a noodle soup dish. i got the #8 which had quite a kick to it but was yummy. had noodles in it too. finally ordered the monthly (?) special which was a spicy garlic noodle dish that had different kinds of meat and shrimp in it. got it hot, and it was quite spicy. a lot of food i couldn't finish it. the flavors were well balanced."}
{"text":"Winner, winner.  Chicken dinner! ... Yes I am that excited about this place.  SOOO glad the original Phenom Phen Owner/Chef decided to grace Clevelanders again with his mad culinary skills!    The other Yelp reviews nailed the location, physical place and wonderful staff.  There are only a few things I would like to add:   I am fond of their chicken basil fried rice.  Swung by for carryout a few weeks ago.  While waiting, I tried a new beverage.  Iced French coffee w/ condensed milk.  Holy cow !!  Not only was it refreshing after the spicy (I like medium plus) but kicked me into supercharge mode."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine. I could literally randomly point to any item on the menu and be happy with my meal - it's that good! The Somlaw soup is outstanding and the bowl is huge! Also try the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt with choice of meat - the lemon grass and other spices shine! Portions are large and prices are very reasonable. The owners are lovely and are happy to help you select the perfect dish."}
{"text":"Considered by locals in the know to be the best ethnic food restaurant in Cleveland, Cuisine du Cambodge did not disappoint, and I went in with fairly high expectations after reading the reviews. After perusing the lengthy menu, we settled on the vegetarian fresh roll to start, then on to entrees. We both chose things we were completely unfamiliar with...we have a Cambodian restaurant near us, but the food we choose always seems more like Thai. Doug went for Banh Sougnh with chicken, which the menu described as fresh round rice noodles in home-made whipped coconut milk ( sounds so alluring!) with lemon grass, lettuce, cucumber, spring rolls, Asian basil, ground peanuts and other stuff in their special sauce. This dish reads a bit like the rice vermicelli noodle dish you find in Vietnamese restaurants, but with coconut milk. I went for Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt, which is unpronouncable, but looked like a curry from the ingredient list. I ordered it with chicken. Both dishes floored us...exotic and unctious flavors that were perfectly balanced between spicy, sweet and salty, with chicken that was not overcooked, but meltingly tender. The noodles in the Banh were subtly flavored with the coconut milk, which leant just a hint of sweetness, like drinking the juice straight out of a coconut, and the raw ingredients were as fresh as they could be. My curry kept revealing itself to me as I ate it, the way the best food does, and the heat level...I had asked for medium...was just enough to keep pulling me back in. We had decided we would share, but I ws loathe to give over my curry when it was time...Doug thought I was going to stab him with my chopsticks. I was feeling a little protective, I'll admit. We talked to a friend of ours who lives in Cleveland the next day, and she says this is the best restaurant in town. She was surprised we found it, and I told her, hey, I Yelp!"}
{"text":"decided to try this after reading the reviews; don't be put off by the outside appearance.  Yes, it's not a fancy place but the food was good although not much chicken in the chicken pad thai.  Very good flavor, and fairly large portion.  Overhearing the waiters it was apparent that there were numerous repeat customers eating here which is a good sign.  Wait staff very friendly.  I'll go back, when I'm over on that side of town."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional. We started the meal with some really flavorful soups. The small soups were pretty big servings and for only 3$. Chock full of fresh vegetables, meat and noodles. The entrees were massive and so tasty. They can also vary the level of spiciness for the majority of their meals. Many vegetarian options. Great service and not too crowded."}
{"text":"Former Chef/Owner of Phnom Pehn, which explains why the food here is so good, and the food at Phnom Pehn is no longer that good.    Similar menu, better prices, higher quality food.   Always friendly.  Spicy Beef Hue soup is the best soup I've had in town!  Hallway to bathroom is bathed in electric blue light, and contains a cool trophy section."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian restaraunt in all of Cleveland area!  Contrary to other reviews, I'm vegan and have had absolutely no problem.  I just ask the girl to help me and she takes care of me.  Surprisingly she always remembers me, even though I don't go that often.  I will miss her when she goes off to college!  The food is always steaming hot and the flavors fantastic.  I love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Please try this place for the most amazing Asian food in the region!  This is the same great food as the old Phnom Penh, with a cleaned up act! Service was excellent and the food was delicious.  You really need to experience a stuffed chicken wing appetizer, while you wait for your entre... Soups, all homemade from scratch, and are unmatched in quality, freshness and flavor!   I stick with the Pad Thai, and can't go wrong cause its  good, but I'm missing out on slot of other awesome concoctions, because I don' ever want to switch from what I knows AMAZING!  Last but not least ...... No liqour license, so it's a BYOB. bring a bottle of wine or beer to drink with your meal, and they will provide an opener or corkscrew, along with glasses!    Ok, so that was not last, but this is.... Price is way too cheap for the amazing dishes served, and the generous portions to get!!! It's the owners way of getting people in to try them. Don't expect to see them on Groupon at 1/2 price, in reality, every day you you go there, you are getting your meal at Better than 1/2 price!!!!  Just try this place, you won't be disappointed!

{"text":"I love this place.  The family is so damn cool, they really make you feel at home.  The food is incredible!  Seriously!  So fresh and unique with flavors that will blow your flipping mind!  They're not afraid to melt your face off with spice and I like that.  Fear not, cool down that burning with magical fruit smoothies.  Easily one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been to the original Phnom Penh many times long ago and was excited for the reopening with the original chef. The food has always been great. That is not the issue. Today, on our third visit since reopening, my partner requested (as he has in the past) for the wide noodles in his dish instead of the thin noodles that is listed on the menu item. It's never been an issue, but today, the server went and asked the cook and she declined to allow the substitution claiming it would \"change the flavor\" of the dish. WTF? Who is eating the food? How dare you tell your customers that they can or can't have what they wish? On top of that, the way the server relayed that was very rude. We walked out and will never return.  Food - great, service - abysmal."}
{"text":"Hidden GEM of Cleveland .  Not to be missed. Must try the soups. Must try  entrees .  Must try the ice coffee .  Must try everything .  Lol. This is what embodies  a genuine small business  family  run restaurant  that deserves all the success.  Rock on"}
{"text":"Cuisine Du Cambodge is definitely a great place to check out! My friend brought me here, and the food was unbelievable! The egg rolls are some of the best i have ever ate, not to mention the service is pretty awesome as well! The menu has many options, so everyone can find something that they like."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and every time I'm not disappointed. The food is amazing and I've never had the same thing twice(aside from their fresh spring rolls which are the best I've tried in the city). The menu is big, a bit overwhelming to be honest but the staff is more than happy to explain any item(but just pick one, they're all great). I've made this my go-to restaurant for great food at a good price. No one's beat them yet."}
{"text":"In the last year my wife and I have noticed a distinct  downturn for this establishment.  The first to go was the #8 soup, which was a huge disappointment, as this was the flavor which kept us coming back week after week (no exaggeration, we were there at LEAST once a week).  We polite mentioned the change to our waitress, who went into the kitchen and came back with the reply, \"My mom says the Asian grocery stopped carrying one of the ingredients, and anyway, you're just one customer so we don't care.\"   Hmmmm.  Last night we stopped in for dinner (Tuesday).  The place was maybe half full.  My wife ordered Asian Basil Fried Rice and myself and my daughter ordered Pad Thai.  I asked for chicken with mine and extra EXTRA spicy, my daughter ordered shrimp.    When the food arrived, mine had shrimp (with tails...ridiculous) and was bland as the day is long.  The shrimp were tiny and few in number (maybe 4 in the entire plateful).  My daughter's arrived correctly with shrimp and was bland (which is what she ordered).  At one point I scooped a forkful of my wife's Basil Fried Rice and it was bland.  Hardly any flavor.  (As an aside, we finally stopped in at the Phnom Penh in North Olmstead, which used to be affiliated with Cuisine Du Cambodge and still shares an almost identical menu, and found their #8 soup to be exactly like Cuisine's original flavor...so apparently their Asian grocery is still happening)  I don't know what's happening to this restaurant...whether the economy is forcing them to cut corners or what.  They used to be a hidden gem for Cleveland and we talked them up at every opportunity, dragging our friends there constantly.  But somehow they jumped the shark.  The Phnom Penh at Great Northern retains all the original flavors which brought us to Cuisine, and truth be told, is a much nicer restaurant.  Their prices ARE higher and the portions ARE smaller, and maybe that's the trade-off.  But honestly, if I wanted lesser-quality food with larger portions, I'd go to Applebee's or Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is a REAL review from a REAL person, BTW.   Same owners as the old Phnom Phenh. Great little place with great food. No frills. No fancy schmancy. Just great Cambodian food. Everything is super fresh and tasty.   Ordered the lemongrass stuffed chicken wings. They were excellent. Plump and flavorful. Also had some kind of pork chop entree. I can't remember the name, but it was yummy. Be careful of the bones! My summer roll could have had a little less rice noodles and a little more meat. A bit bland. But the dipping sauce was divine.  Make sure you check the hours. We tried to go here 2 different times and it was closed. Slightly funky hours."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! This was my first experience with Cambodian cuisine, but I am a big fan of Thai to begin with, so I just had to try this place out. I had a great dinner experience here with a friend on a week night. Seems as though this place doesn't get much traffic, possibly owing to the secluded Lorain Ave. location, but I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere. We received very helpful and very friendly service. I had the appetizer sampler #3 and the house special 41A, both of which were very delicious. Can't go wrong with the sampler, as there is a good variety on the plate and frankly everything is worth trying. The smoothies here are also very good, and a must-have with the meal. The large portion sizes are also a plus, and make this place a great value. I definitely feel that this place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to Kamm's Corners and my favorite cuisine is Vietnamese, particularly pho.  Since the closest Vietnamese place is in Parma (Tay Do) I decided to try this place based on reviews, and was delighted to see they offer a small bowl of pho bo tuong for $2.95.  I also had #68 which I'm glad I ordered medium spicy.  I usually go full strength and medium was nose-running good.  The wife had #92.  Bottom line, the pho was heavenly and we both enjoyed our meals tremendously.  No skimping on quantity either, there was plenty enough for dinner and lunch another day.  I'm thrilled that I can try new things and also feed my pho addiction.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"this place is sooooo good. basically my favorite place in all of cleveland. the decor here doesn't even matter when you take a bite into the food. I think there is only like one grandma cooking tho so food can be a little slow to come out.  usually I get a tofu and vegetable and the traditional stir fry noodle. nom nom nom.  the portions are huge so there's always plenty to take home. they are also byob I believe although I've personally never taken advantage of that. I only come here once in a while tho bc it's like a treat to myself for something special but I could eat this every day."}
{"text":"Most amazing food! Every dish is fabulous! Bring some cash because they no longer accept credit. The owner is a riot and always makes sure his customers are happy and enjoying their meal.  I recommend the creamy shrimp roll or fried tofu as an appetizer. If your a coffee lover....try the French pressed iced coffee with condensed milk."}
{"text":"If I have another chance to go again, I will probably order something different and my review will change. My group ordered the papaya salad, crispy wings, beef meatball pho, beef lort cha, and beef stir fried noodles. Everything was good except for the papaya salad. It was a weird red color and had a weirder aftertaste. Nothing at all like I'm used to. It was almost vinegary, sweet and sour, and dried fish tasting. It also came with a HUGE plate of fried rice that I was not expecting to be so huge. The waitress asked if I liked it or not but I wanted to be polite so I said it was \"different\". Like I said, next time I will order something different like one of the Cha Kroeung dishes. Maybe I was biased because I compared it to my mom's own delicious Khmer cooking. I am willing to give one more shot the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"They always have fresh, well seasoned, delicious food every time that I've been. My favorite is the garlic and blackened jumbo shrimp. Even if you're not a big Asian food fan, I'd definitely recommend you give this place a try even once, and you won't regret it. The customer service is great, and your can really tell the employees care about this family run business. Overall a great experience. They also do takeout."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I've been here multiple occasions and this place never gets old! Their soup is the best whether it's cold or hot outside! My favorite is the #3 ( Beef rice noodle soup ).  I also enjoy the Chicken pad thai, they give you nice chuncks of chicken and the spice is brilliant! If you ever want to eat spicy, this is the place to be! Very friendly service, the place is a warm, cozy welcoming."}
{"text":"This place was FABULOUS!  Nothing bland at all, just FLAVOR, FLAVOR, FLAVOR!  Delicious food and very friendly service.  I had several questions & they were all answered in a very kind manner.  Their menu is (as mentioned by another customer) quite large.  You can basically get any kind of noodle or rice dish you could want...with whatever veggies and meat you like.  I had the Seafood Loath Chha...I'll be getting that again!  My husband had the Beef Lac Loc (a house special with the special fried rice) and that was great too...best fried rice EVAR!  We'll be back for sure and we'll be bringing friends!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!  GO THERE NOW...GO!!!"}
{"text":"Flavor. Flavor. Flavor.  While situated in an obscure location in a west side Cleveland neighborhood, this joint offers authentic Cambodian cuisine at a great value.   I recommend any of the soup bowls. They are spiced just right and satisfy on a cold, damp, Cleveland day."}
{"text":"Game on.  There is no reason to go to any other SE Asian restaurant in town.  This place gives you plenty of taste-bud popping food at a good price.  The heat levels are adjustable to your individual taste and the family/staff are friendly and warm.  Some other reviewers mentioned the not-so-great parking, which is true.  Some reviewers mentioned the place isn't going to win any awards for decor.  Also true.  Well, if you are like me and judge a restaurant by how well you like the food, you will be very happy you ignored the minor inconveniences and had a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Spicy and super cheap. Authentic."}
{"text":"I love the Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt (hot spice level)! The best way to describe it is similar to a Thai red curry, but with more aromatics and a little less chili heat.  I have only been once, and we got there just before open. The family was running a little late, but were happy to let us in and serve us. Great food, great service, and the owner talked to us for at least a half hour after the meal, just telling us about the restaurant and his story of coming here from Cambodia; all in all a wonderful experience. Glad to have Cambodian food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to say other than go there now. My date ordered everything as I was completely overwhelmed with the menu. We split three vegetarian dishes and each one was better than the next.  The basil fried rice was intoxicating!. It wasn't greasy, not in the lease.  Yeah ambience is pretty rough but the food and prices are worth suffering through.   I want to go back every night forever."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here (usually for carry out) weekly.  This is a family run business and they are super nice.  Food is consistently amazing, the menu offers a great variety and the price is right."}
{"text":"This place is like Phnom Penh's big, grown up sister.   I can't even quite place what they do differently here, but all the dishes I loved from their sister location, I ordered here and loved even more. Let's start from the beginning:   The storefront is just about the only thing not better than their W.25th location. Why? Carpet. Blegh--hate carpet in restaurants. Other than that, I can see why people sing the praises of Cuisine Du Cambodge.   - Wonton soup: Can someone confirm if they make their own wontons? Because it certainly tastes like it. Delicate dumplings with large cuts of pork in a wonderful broth. And I thought their W25th location had my favorite wonton.   - Egg Rolls: These tasted homemade as well. The outside was super-crunchy and the inside was piping hot with veggies, spices and pork. So delicious.  - Vegetable Pad Thai: Holy portion Gods of the Universe. This dinner provided me with three meals. One dinner for myself and then lunch the next day for my boyfriend and I. What in the world?! And the prices are the same as their Ohio City restaurant--such a great deal. The dish tasted fresh, love their signature pickled veggies, too. My only compliant is that since I ordered it \"veggie\" I wish there would have been more substantial veggies included. There was pickled cabbage and carrot shreds--nothing sturdy (i.e. broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, onions... anything!) although still delicious.  And the service was very friendly. In fact, the owner chatted with us for a bit, as well as his daughter--who was very pleasant!   Parking: minimal. Two spaces up front and then street parking about a block away. If you're just picking up, it's not so convenient, but not enough to keep you away from the delicousness"}
{"text":"My wife and I started coming here almost a year ago after reading the great yelp reviews and it has quickly become a favorite. The food is excellent, extremely flavorful and the ingredients always seem fresh. The owner always seems to be there and he is very pleasant and friendly. The menu is huge and a little overwhelming but once I found a few dishes I liked I generally stick to those. The place is kind of a hole-in-the-wall and the decor is on the shabby side but that kind of adds to the charm. The prices are great also. I've brought a lot of friends and family from out of town and everyone seems to love it. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Popped in with my friend on a Friday night. Was pretty empty inside, but a lot of ppl we're getting takeout. Inside is fine, typical for a small Asian restaurant. Also with a giant menu. However, the two girls working there were quite friendly and talkative and we had quite an enjoyable conversation with them. Quite outgoing.  So we started with some hot tea and I had an egg soda drink with condensed milk, which was like an egg nog (sweetened with the condensed milk) with mild carbonation and no spices. It was sweet and pretty good.  Then we shared the stir fried eggplant with shrimp and beef (number 42) and Chicken coconut Chha Kreoung Ma Ross Prowt. Both were really good. The eggplant was quite tasty, full of flavor and not too oily or anything. Great the next day heated up. The Chha Kreoung was also quite tasty, well spiced. Lots of sauce, much like the gravy in Americanized Chinese food. I woulda liked less sauce, but I'm more interested in healthy. Overall good stuff. You can get a mix of traditional and americanized stuff here."}
{"text":"I came to Cuisine du Cambodge with somewhat high expectations given the Yelp reviews and some very strong recommendations from friends and family alike, and, food-wise, I think the restaurant largely met those expectations.  The Shrimp Roll appetizer was good, though it was overcooked and I can't say I was a fan of the unexpected mayonnaise-based sauce hidden inside.  The Beef Loc Lac was a solid beef and onion combination dish and goes well with the included fried rice (which, at $9.95, is quite a value).  I really enjoyed, though, the Somlaw Machou Kreoung (aka Sour Fantasy Stew), which we were warned featured \"really strong flavors.\"  When served over the accompanying white rice, those flavors--highlighted by the lemon grass--get soaked up into the rice and, as a result, a little more evened out.  The reason for the 2-star review, however, was the unfortunate and growing collection of used plates (multiple stacks, some four or five high) on several tables in the small dining room that remained unbussed throughout our dinner.  At least as a matter of hygiene if not aesthetics, it's an issue with a simple solution that should be addressed.  If not for that problem, given the good combination of authenticity and value, Cuisine du Cambodge would have merited a strong 3-star rating."}
{"text":"I pretty much eat here weekly. Can't go wrong with the crispy wings and chicken and shrimp Pad Thai medium spiced. The staff is so friendly and helpful. The menu is very extensive so it will definitely take a while to look over. However I guarantee you almost all of the dishes are worth it. I've never brought anyone here who left disappointed."}
{"text":"I THINK THEY CLOSED! Nooooo!!!!  Closest thing to Pad Thai I've had in cleveland. Fried rice was great too. Portion and price on point as well."}
{"text":"Oh no!!!!! It seems to be CLOSED. I saw people working inside so I hope they are just remodeling. This is one of my fave places to go and I will be very upset if it is closed for goo. :("}
{"text":"A cannot miss place to get some excellent Asian food.  This is the original owner and chef from who brought Cambodian food to Cleveland and they are still putting out the best you can get around here.  Located in a small free standing building, it is easy to miss, just look for the awning.  Once inside you will find a small dining room with a cutout to the kitchen.  Decor is minimal, but sufficient.  Service is attentive and friendly, with most items coming out promptly.  The menu is long and complicated.  There are a ton of soups, noodle dishes and other scrumptious dishes.  I would strongly recommend the Pad Thai, the Mi Boorang and the Loath Cha.  The flavors here are exotic, but vivid and crisp, with wonderful textures and contrasts.  Prices are inexpensive, so you can afford to come back again and again to try different things.  If you want to try something different, it is hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and get take out. The people here are incredibly friendly and gracious.  I usually try to get something different everytime and while each dish is equally great......I tend to crave my favorites.  I cant say enough how great the House Special Hue Beef Soup (#9 on the menu).  It is eye watering hot and tastes amazing.  Also a big fan of the Delicate Rice Paper Rolls and the sauce that comes with it.  Every dish is always steaming and tastes fresh.  Never had a bad meal and will always keep coming back.  Just a heads up as they are closed on Mondays.  Isnt that weird that I always seem to crave this place on Mondays too?"}
{"text":"So amazing, The pad thai is to die for and the new deluxe rolls were very good. its always clean and quick and they are very nice;"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here after reading all the reviews. Sunday hours are from 3-9. We got there after 3 pm and the doors were still closed. I am writing this review because I'm hangry and very disappointed.   I would have left a review on the food etc but unfortunately, I wasn't able to taste it."}
{"text":"I don't know much about Cambodian cuisine, but I do know that the dishes here have a very homemade feel. The menu is a bit intimidating, so the one time that we visited we just ordered what seemed to be the more signature dishes with the inviting descriptions. The two dishes here were similar to other SE Asian style of stir fried noodles, with a ton of different vegetables, a choice of meat, and a balance of sauce and spice. Flavors in both were a lot deeper and heavier than what I'm used to in similar Thai noodle dishes. The ginger noodle was really strong in that flavor, while the vermicelli had quite a vinegar-y taste. Both were great to start with, especially with all the vegetables and ground peanuts mixed in. One dish was a lot for one person to finish, especially since they were a bit heavy, so at least for us they were suitable for takeout after about halfway through.  Ambiance was a bit dim and not the most modern looking inside, but it was fine. Service was curt but friendly."}
{"text":"Found this place in yelp and coming back to confirm all the positive reviews!  The service was great- server was nice and helpful- very sweet girl. The food was excellent!  I will be back to dine in or for carry out"}
{"text":"Bangh sough is awesome. Great food and friendly service. Love this place for lunch and takeout."}
{"text":"Just call it the Flavor Palace. Tried one of their signature dishes #39 Chha  Bun Kari Kroup Muk. It contains a little bit of everything, topped with lemon grass. You'll have plenty for leftovers. It's a small family ran shop so be patient- it will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Most Authentic Cambodian food i have had in northeast ohio.  been there twice, and go whenever I'm in cleveland.  Great prices & Huge portions!"}
{"text":"Best place for authentic Cambodian food. I've never been to Cambodia, but the flavors in every dish I've tried are so delicious and unique. It's a really amazing place. My mom lives in San Fran, and whenever she comes to visit me here in Cleveland, we always make a trip to Cuisine du Cambodge, order several dishes and share everything. It's the best! I hope this place always stays in business!"}
{"text":"Overwhelmed by the largeness of the menu, I restricted myself to the house specials and got the mikroolaa ($6.75), which is a noodle dish with egg, pork, peanuts, dried shrimp, and small pieces of vegetables. If anyone was wondering based on the menu description--the dish is indeed hot in temperature, not like a noodle salad as I thought it might be before I ordered. I loved the assorted crunchy toppings as well as the tangy flavor of the noodles, reminiscent of pad thai but less heavy since the dish is not stir-fried. I appreciated and felt nostalgic eating the savory dried and various small pieces of pickled vegetables, as it's not often that those more \"weird\" ingredients are included in Asian restaurants in America. I ate the whole thing, and felt satisfied but not feel grossly weighed down at the end of the meal. For an inexpensive, large portion of food, Cuisine du Cambodge is definitely a win!  Even though this non-fast food stop became quite a long rest stop for us on our road trip, I'm glad we took the little detour and time to sit and eat at this small, sweet, authentic Cambodian restaurant randomly in the Cleveland. I really have no idea when I will be able to come again, but I look forward to the opportunity and highly recommend it for those who are able to go."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it was still Phnom Penh back around 2000. The menu is much the same, but still fantastic. They hands-down have the best Pad Thai in Cleveland, and the Cambodian take on Pho is pretty awesome too. It's a tough call between this and Superior Pho for my favorite Asian restaurant in Cleveland.  Please note that as of early 2015 they're back to being cash-only, so hit an ATM before you come here."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of the food here, and a new regular customer!! The place is family owned, which makes me love it even more! You can feel the cozy warm welcome as soon as you enter. The owner's daughter served us both times that I've been here. She's very sweet, and her recommendations for dishes were great! She's very patient and helpful, so if you've never had Cambodian food she's the perfect person to give you advice on what to order.   For appetizers, I liked the homemade chicken patties! It has that zesty lemongrass taste with minced chicken that's very flavorful.   Both times I've been here we ordered the house special noodles, and the beef stew-somlaw machou kreoung (#143). The lemongrass and tamarind flavors are so pungent and delicious! It's the perfect winter stew to have to warm you up, and gives your taste buds a little holiday joy. We also enjoyed #37 the beef phlear- it's light and definitely flavorful, and the perfect balance of meat and veggies. We also got a plate of stir fried veggies (I think #42 cha bunle bimok), which was cooked with a unique sauce. I couldn't pinpoint what was in the sauce, but it was yummy nonetheless and a good dish for vegetarians to enjoy. I will have to try their fresh juices one of these days, which my friends have highly recommended. Until next time...which probably won't be too long of a wait haha! Let's hope I actually remember to take pics as well-oops!"}
{"text":"Wow! I thought I had already wrote a review for here but I guess not! This place has amazing food with the best bang for your buck. For $10 you can leave here stuffed and have enough food left over later. You are always greeted with a smile when you enter the door. I'm yet to try something I don't like here but my favorite is the Fantasy stew (#147). The staff is extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars at this place - we love love love it!!!  From their eggrolls with homemade sauce, to the basil friend rice, to the lo mein, and my favorite the Cha Bung Kari (not sure if that is spelled right).   We have loved everything we have got and continue to go back religiously! Can't give this place enough good reviews!"}
{"text":"Thee absolute best asian food in cleveland. PERIOD. The outside isnt too fancy,but anyone with a good nose and a sense of adventure will see right through the exterior!The  food inside is anything but ordinary. I say it's totally gourmet colorful and delectable!   Also, you'll experience real genuine hospitality with willingness to substitute and recommend the top dishes! Vegetarian friendly! Give this Cleveland gem a try!  you cant possibly regret it!"}
{"text":"We arrived late on a Sunday night, with just an hour before they were supposed to close. However, the waiter was still extremely friendly and helpful. Service is probably slower than you would expect, but the abundance of friendliness makes up for it.  The food was amazing! Whether you are a seasoned asian foodie concerned with authenticity, or a newbie who can't even pronounce the menu, you will find something right up your ally."}
{"text":"A buddy and I came here late after our first Yelp choice restaurant was closed and this was much more than we could have bargained for.  The owner was extremely friendly and we had a very entertaining convo.  He seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and food in general (my buddy was a diabetic and he recommended some dishes for those with type I & II)  Anyway, though the restaurant doesn't look great from the outside, the food itself was amazing.  My buddy (diabetic) ordered a spinach/mushroom/tofu dish and I had the garlic shrimp.  Both were delicious and had the right amount of spice, while also tasting homemade (mentioned before on some previous reviews).  They also had a nice coconut/pineapple smoothie.  5 stars for the service/owner and 4 for the food"}
{"text":"I have never been here before, but tried based on yelp reviews. I wasn't disappointed for sure. Don't let the outside building, neighborhood, or even inside understated decor fool you. This food is amazing.  And The service ,friendliness, and warmth of the owner is so cool.  Hard to find these days. Almost made to feel like an old friend and it was my first time.   The food is extremely varied. I had a small - not so small- bowl of hot and spicy vermicelli soup that was wonderfully spicy and had great depth.  My spicy noodles had so many great flavors from peanut to lemongrass and hint of ginger.  The plate was enough for 2 or 3 people.  Huge portion, but the quality was even better.   I very strongly recommend this place.  If you like authentic Vietnamese /Cambodian food run here. Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Erroneous post The sign on the door says:  \"closed for remodeling... Will reopen under new management\"  ****************************************************************************** Sorry Philip, don't know how this got posted here, comment was meant for Mi Pueblo.  Your place is great! Both food and staff are top notch!"}
{"text":"Nearly everything I've gotten here is delicious. I love the fried tofu appetizer, and the beef rice noodle soup, though the beef could be a bit more tender, but good flavor. I like the dishes with coconut whip."}
{"text":"Where have you been all of my life???  Went here for dinner last night with the husband and the nephew and was beyond impressed.  It is a hole in the wall type place, but that's ok since you usually find the best food at such places, and this was true to form.  They don't serve alcohol, but you can bring your own.  We started out with the mussels entree for an appetizer and they were just incredible.  So flavorful!  I had the spicy ginger noodles which were amazing.  They have a hot sauce on the table which is delicious and actually hot!  I can't remember what everybody else got because I was way too focused on my amazing meal.  The service was friendly and quick.  We will definitely be back, most likely next weekend."}
{"text":"Their menu is extensive - navigate it by starting with their specials (the Mikroolaa never fails). It might be a good business decision to downsize the menu to 30 items instead 100+ but I guess it's not up to me.   They make simple stuff really tasty. And cheap. A shrimp salad for $2.45? It's a great salad too. Their pho is as delicious as the pho at any Vietnamese restaurant in Cleveland, and that's only 1/100 of their repertoire.   How they run this place with such a large menu with seemingly one family of 3 is beyond me. The owners and their daughter are super nice - talk to them and tip them nicely!  The only issues I've had is the relatively slow service (due to their staff size I guess). I usually do take-out so it doesn't bother me. A take-out of 4 dishes can easily last two people a couple of days and that's under $30."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner on a cold and rainy in night in the Cleveland area. I assumed I'd be able to order Pho Ga - but I found no such item on the menu. I asked the lady waiting on me about it - she pointed out something that was their Cambodian equivalent of Pho Ga - it was a chicken soup, so I rolled the dice and went with that.  When the bowl came out, it was steaming away - usually a good sign. The plate of aromatics only contained bean sprouts (lots of them) and two lime wedges - no Basil and no Jalapeño slices. I asked - they did have Basil, but no Jalapeños slices, so I went with the Basil. They did have a small jar of a chili paste in an oil base and a bottle of Sriracha sauce on the table. I tasted the chili paste and ended up adding a good bit of it to the broth, along with the bean sprouts, Basil, and squeezed both lime wedges into the broth for good measure.  Overall the chicken broth was very tasty, the noodles were wider and flatter than most most Vietnamese Phos - and the chicken was very tender. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed my soup! Service was good! The lady working checked on me several times.  Cash only. I'd come back here again for more soup! Yummm!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Being Vietnamese, I'm very familiar with VN food and also Thai due to the abundance of Thai restaurants in general. Cambodian food, however, are harder to come by. Cambodian food is very similar mixture with Thai/Vietnamese food. We had the special fried rice, the Beef Kuy Tiev Chia, and another dish that I don't remember. They were all really good and great value but the fried rice stood out as the best value and was super delicious. I also tried the jackfruit smoothie which was pretty good but I think they used canned fruits to make it so a bit too syrupy for me. The setting of this place isn't going to win you over so if you're picky about that, I suggest you order take out. The menu is large - too large in my opinion. I'd prefer a small menu where they specialize in doing some really strong dishes. I know a few Vietnamese things in their menu require alot of time time make (broth for the pho or any of their other soup based items) And if it's not a place that does mainly those dishes than I don't know how they can make them well or fresh - so I didn't order those. Their stir-fried dishes are spot on though. Alot of the menu items are very similar to each other so it gets overwhelming and hard for me to choose from. If they could condense it down, it would be more efficient for customers to choose - esp. those that are not familiar with SE Asian cuisines to begin with."}
{"text":"Food was great, but I think they're out of business.  The published phone number doesn't work, and there is a sign on the building stating that it is available."}
{"text":"Portions are great! Food is so fresh and price is awesome. Only sad thing is they only take cash"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for Asian cuisine in the Cleveland area.  My go-to menu item is the #23 vermicelli with chicken, but am also a fan of the pad Thai, curry chicken soup (it's spicy hot but very flavorful), and the spring rolls rock.    For those who live in the burbs, it's well worth the trip into the city.  Easily accessible from 71 or 90."}
{"text":"Ah, so this is what Cambodian food tastes like.  Came here with a bunch of friends a couple of weeks after trying Cambodian food for the first time from another restaurant in Ohio City.  This place was distinctly better.  I had absolutely no idea what to order and the waitress directed me to order #41 - the Chha Kreoung Tek Trey Phem (say what?).  It was huge, very flavorful, packed full of stuff, and way too spicy for my taste (p.s. I ordered non-spicy).  Putting the spice aside, it was still pretty good and I fought my painful tastebuds and my sense of satiety for awhile before finally giving up.    My other six friends I came with enjoyed their dishes as well, and none of them were able to finish either."}
{"text":"The WORST The pad Thai was bland, the spring was an eggroll? I've been to many a thai restaurants and this place is the worst of the worst."}
{"text":"Be patient, and you will rewarded. The service is good but the food will take time. They are a small family run business. I don't mind because this is the kind of place to come in comfy clothes, hang out, and eat good food, not a fancy time.   The menu can be overwhelming so I asked for the server's recommendation which was #39. Chha Bun Kari Kroup Muk. It was absolutely delicious, especially if you love lemongrass. Plus, it's BYOB and big size portions, so yay for a meal the next day."}
{"text":"I wish we lived closer to this place because I love it. The menu is huge and takes a while to sort through, but since everything I have ever ordered here is delicious you really can't lose. I had the Asian Basil Fried Rice with Chicken.and made 3 meals out of it. My daughter did the same with her order of Chicken Pad Thai. The service is friendly and helpful. The only downside Is the parking and the dining room. The dining room is dark and could use a sprucing up. The parking is nonexistent. A recent curb replacement eliminated access to the two meager spaces which once were available in front of the restaurant. Fortunately you can typically find a space on a side street and walk the short distance.  It's well worth the walk, the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Plus you get to help support some truly wonderful people."}
{"text":"Best deal for Asian noodles/rice dishes in Cleveland, in my opinion.  I've been here twice - and both times, I left impressed and very full.  Cambodian food is similar to Thai food (of which there are a lot more restaurants in Cleveland), but it definitely has distinct flavors from Thai food.  Most recently, I ordered the Chha Kreoung, which is similar to Pad Thai but not the same as Pad Thai.  The dish consists of a lot of flat rice noodles and an abundance of whatever meat you choose to order.  I ordered the beef Chha Kreoung with fried tofu (you need to pay a little more for the tofu).  The vegetables include fried onions and peppers.  Portions are HUGE.  I came in starving and was very full.  My friends took half of their dishes home.  In the past, I've ordered the Chha Kreoung Tek Trey Phem, which is the restaurant's house specialty and incredibly delicious.   Service was reasonable.  The waiters and waitresses are friendly.  Few critiques, but nothing that would keep me from giving this restaurant a 5 star rating.  Our food didn't come out at the same time, but I'm assuming that's because not a lot of people are working in the kitchen.  Also, the menu could be condensed.  But both times I've gotten a good recommendation from the waiter or waitress, so this isn't an issue at all.  Great food at a very reasonable price!  My super size noodle dish was only $10."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I've eaten five different dishes and they have all been fantastic. On top of the great food, the owners are very friendly. It's a must go if you enjoy Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This could have been a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the long thick black hair in my main dish.  The beef hue soup was fantastic.  My main dish had the hair in it.  Service was excellent but I'm not sure if I'll ever come back.  There isn't any parking at the building really, but you can park on the nearby streets."}
{"text":"I've had take-out about a dozen times over the last couple of months... perhaps this is the first indicator of how much I enjoy their food.  After first stumbling across this place earlier this year, I returned the very next night and ordered the very same thing-- it was so good!  Since then, I've branched out and just started ordering any random dish and have been quite pleased.  The food is always ready when I'm ready to pick it up and always fresh, flavorful, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Sean and I love this place. We never seem to think of it when we're all 'where should we grab some food....I don't know.....'. But whenever we come we're always wondering why we don't stop in here more often.   Huge portions, excellent, fresh dishes and a huge, varied menu. Something for everyone here. At least two meals-worth of food no matter what you order.   The staff is a very nice family all working together as is commonly seen at these types of places. Mom & Dad in back, kids serving out front. Service is always spot-on and friendly. Clean, cozy dining room which is perfectly good for eating in which is nice - a lot of places like this are pretty much take-out only worthy.  Love Cuisine Du Cambodge, we'll be back again and again. Definitely give this place a try next time you're up for an ethnic food face-stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  My husband comes at least once a week for lunch- he loves it that much!  The food is so fresh and delicious.  The menu is absolutely overwhelming, but everything we have ever tried has been delicious.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I happened upon this little gem. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals which included the Cambodian Crepe and a bowl of Bun Cha Glo. Both were delicious, and we had a great conversation with the owner's 16 year old daughter, who is a very personable and knowledgeable young lady and an excellent hostess! (i think i just used the same description as richard b.) Two thumbs up! I'm only in the cleveland area once a year, but I'm definitely coming back to Cuisine Du Cambodge when i visit next!"}
{"text":"Ugh I was so excited about this place! After all of the amazing reviews I read, I could not wait to get off of work to order takeout. However, I don't know that I will return. I ordered a Vietnamese noodle salad with chicken and when I called the women recommended that I get a different style of Vietnamese noodle salad with some lemongrass sauce. She said it was delicious and that I would probably like it better than the normal salad I wanted to order. I listened, and I ordered what she recommended. Big mistake.  When I got home and opened the box, I was so disgusted. There was this weird yellow greenish sauce everywhere! I couldn't even stand the smell of it let alone eat it. I just picked off the top that was covered in that weird sauce and tried to it the rest but just couldn't stand the smell. So it ended up in the garbage.   I also remember the inside of the place just looking dirty and I saw a women in the kitchen blowing her nose and she didn't have any gloves on or anything. The whole kitchen looked dirty and just gross. I think the whole place needs a good cleaning.   P.S. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"On this visit we came with two long-time, most excellent friends. It was largely based on my recommendation that they agreed to come, so I did feel a significant level of responsibility for their level of enjoyment. It was rather early on... perhaps on the cusp of ordering that the male friend proclaimed that he was \"not a huge fan of the seasoning profile of Asian seasoning.\" Immediately my mind began darting about, was it ginger or garlic or Chinese 5 spice, or fish sauce or soy sauce or curry, what that was the Genesis of this distaste?  Regardless, I could hear the low metallic screech of ice on the metal of my ship's culinary hull much like Titanic's Captain must have experienced.  A second hit took place when his spouse, in attempting to determine what to order, mentioned an aversion to al things coconut, in an earlier conversation she had mentioned an aversion to fish sauce. At this point, realizing that the breach had been of both the outer AND inner hulls, I could only hope that by sealing compartments off , we might avert a sinking of the entire ship! Feeling a sense of desperation overwhelming me, I quickly suggested they simply scan the menu under the heading of the proteins they liked and try to find something that met with their palate's sensitivities. Feeling that, at least temporarily I had averted seeing the meal take a downward spiral, we proceeded to the ordering of app's and meals. My heart became buoyant when they both ordered the won-ton soup, sans hesitation, as well as entrees that hopefully would meet with their approval. My spirits became even more buoyant, when they both were absolutely effusive with praise regarding the won-ton soup which, (medium-sized), arrived in portions that were somewhere between a quart and 3 pints in size. And the fixins were more than generous, including 5 to 7 slices of what appeared to be pork tenderloin, copious amounts of dumplings, bok choy, and other items which escape recollection, in a broth with flavors layered and complex enough that our gentleman companion was moved to inquire as to the seasonings used in it's creation!  They also got egg rolls which are delicious,  actually have proteins and such inside and are not all bok-choy! At this point they are both effusive in their praise of the food, and happily grabbing this life-preserver of praise I quickly said that I would not steer them wrong in a culinary recommendation. Quickly, the gentleman gave me a look which said wordlessly, \"Oh yeah?  What about that time you took me to \"Sweetbreads, Tripe and Headcheese 'R Us?\"  I must confess no recollection whatsoever of having taken them or suggested such a place, but hey..the old memory ain't what it  used to be! The lady and I ordered shrimp rolls, forgetting that they are just a shrimp and cream cheese rolled in a won ton wrapper and deep fried, and followed with an order of egg rolls, which are sublime. For entrees, our gentleman friend ordered Beef Loc Lac with Special Fried Rice, ( lettuce, sliced tomato, ring onion, with marinated beef in a black pepper lemon sauce). which when served was mounded copiously high on a platter 10\" by 6\" at it's widest point, with a serving of fried rice of equal size, which combined, he was hard-pressed to reduce by half, serving praise for the dish with every other bite! Our lady friend got Chicken Pad Thai, with rice noodles scallions beansprouts, ground peanuts, sautéed with pickled cabbage and carrots, and chicken of course. It's difficult to judge whether it was the enormous volume of the \"medium-sized\" won-ton soup combined with egg-roll or the fact that she has an aversion to all things orange. (the dish was entirely day-glow orange in color!) or what, but she didn't take a single bite that I saw, but she did take it home, whether for her, her dogs or her daughter I just don't know. My wife got Shrimp Banh Soungh, (chunky rice noodles. lettuce cucumber bean sprouts home-made whipped coconut cream scallions chopped spring rolls Asian basil ground peanuts dried shrimp stir-fried lemongrass and other spices, special sauce and of course shrimp, which she loved. I got their \"special\", which changes each time we dine, Bun Chha Muri Kari Mates, skinny rice noodles, chicken, tofu, shrimp, beef variious veggies, in a ginger/garlic and other stuff sauce, (I don't have the description.) It was sublime.  My only complaint is that especially when buried in a huge mound of noodles, if shrimp are in the dish...take the damn tails off!  They can cause one to choke,  can't be digested, and if consumed are bound to collect with seeds, stems and hulls and such and slowly plug up the colon over time, really restaurateurs give a thought to this issue...presentation is not everything, occasionally practicality should prevail, otherwise start serving chicken legs with the foot attached, beef with the hoof or horn or hide attached, and the like. Alcohol is not served, but they apparently have no issue with bringing your own."}
{"text":"I have to review again, because since I have started going to this place, I have branched out and tried so many things. The addiction is real.   But this weekend, we tried the beef phlear. My niece who had never had this style of food and flavors was obsessed with this dish, I was too. It is the most tasty dish- gently stir fried veggies (red and green peppers were perfectly cooked!) and the beef is so tender and juicy which compliments the crunchy veggies. The flavors are savory with a hint of sweet. Served with the most amazing fried rice. NOT greasy and perfect ratio of veggies to rice. Amazing.   We also had #23, the bun with chicken which is the most stellar go-to dish. The spring rolls and chicken are always cooked perfectly.  We also had the pad thai- we asked for no spice since my niece wasn't feeling the spice but it would have been better with some spice. I advise getting it the way they make it. The noodles are pink which is odd, but the flavor is awesome.  I am only sad that the beef phlear is served only on the weekend!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Out of all the hole in the wall, mom and pop, independent establishments tucked away in every nook and cranny in the area, Cambodge is the best I've had. They offer an extreme value for the consumer - dishes may reach up to $12-13, but you can easily eat 2 or 3 meals from one main dish.  I love this style of cuisine - sweet, salty, sour, spicy, savory, aromatic - all of these flavors and sensations balance naturally at the experienced hand of the chef. Texture plays an paramount role in the greater scheme of enjoying these dishes as well. Crunchy on top of soft, sweet followed by savory, Cambodge is an exercise in contrast.   One of my favorite things to order is the appetizer sampler, which showcases many different fried and fresh appetizers, like egg and spring rolls, tofu, chicken wings, etc. Everything on the plate is perfectly executed. The plate always comes to your table less than 5 minutes from ordering, so you can have confidence the items were pulled out of the wok and delivered directly to your table.  Their garlic and black pepper shrimp is the best seafood dish i have ever had. The batter is not shy - thick and rugged, deeply crunchy, not lightly crispy - it makes you work for the shrimp reward inside. The batter is also flavored perfectly as a compliment to the shrimp. I'm not sure what is in it, but it makes my mouth water like crazy.  They saute little bits of bell pepper and onion which acts as the base for plating the shrimp, and these little nuggets are a delicious supplement to the dish.  While these are my two favorite dishes, I have had dozens more, and everything is better than the last. I would give Cambodge my highest recommendation to anyone. It is the crown jewel of Cleveland's network of low-key off-the-beaten-path ethnic eateries."}
{"text":"Wow, I really like Cuisine Du Cambodian.  It's definitely your homemade type of food- like, you going over to your Cambodian friend's house where their mom makes you awesome food that flavorful, tasty, and filling.  Yep, that's this place.  I had stepped off the plane from NY when my bf asked me if I had wanted Cambodian. After having eaten a full weekend of great food in NY, I was a little apprehensive..but curious.  So off we went. This restaurant would be a bit easy to miss as it's on Lorain..but man, I was happy to walk in.  It was a quiet Sunday night, but the wait staff and restaurant personnel were very warm and friendly. We ordered some vermicelli noodles (I forget the name) as well as chicken chha kreoung. Man, both dishes were phenomenal.   I loved this place. The food was cooked great, the restaurant owners were so friendly, and I left with such a happy stomach.  Hmm. Maybe Cleveland does have a good taste in Cambodian food. I'm a definite return to this place!"}
{"text":"yumm another authentic Asian restaurant!  we ordered three dishes - spicy ginger noodle the house signature dish, 41a which is stir fried vermicelli sour version, and chicken coconut Chua kreoung ma rass prowt. I would highly recommend all three of them - they are all very different and yummy. the ginger noodle is more seafood like and spicy. the vermicelli is sour but I LOVE the fried tofu in the dish, and the chicken coconut dish was very curry like and satisfying. tastes like home comfort food. the price was pretty reasonable too. three dishes was definitely enough for two meals for two people who can eat a lot haha.  my only complaint is their service speed. again, this is a family own restaurant so it is kinda expected that it is going to be understaffed. so be prepare to wait for at least half an hour before you get your food. also, the kitchen tend to be super smoky - it definitely made me cough when I was walking pass the kitchen to go to the bathroom."}
{"text":"Having recently visited Phom Penh, we had high expectations for this place, but it exceeded our expectations in every way by far!!  I can't recommend Cuisine du Cambodge enough.  We got takeout from here, including #37 Beef Phlear with Special Fried Rice (which is available Friday-Sunday only) and #119 Chicken Coconut Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt.  Both were amazing.  #37 was a delicious lemony mix of tender seared beef with a delightful lemongrass flavor with some vegetables and some ground peanuts.  #119 was a yummy stir-fry-type chicken dish over rice with more of a turmeric flavor to it with vegetables and ground peanuts.  Both were excellent and I would recommend them highly!    Their menu is really extensive, with lots of different rice and noodle dishes, soups and other yummy entrees to choose from.  The staff were really friendly, and it was a cozy family-owned place.  Merci beaucoup, Cuisine du Cambodge; we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  We order here often and they deliver authentic cuisine at amazing heat levels (adjusted to your liking)"}
{"text":"This is a very interesting place, I'll admit. I was very skeptical before I entered the restaurant as the outside truly indeed looked a little sketchy. But the interior is a lot nicer. Generally speaking, I have no complain about the food nor the service. But I did see some flies wandering around my food, that's why I only gave a four star. My fav dish is the #8 soup with extra spiciness, the flavor was almost exactly like what I had in china. I also ordered #37 as suggested by the other yelpers, I liked it but IMO it's just a little messy, for the lack of a better word. The flavor is good, but i could only identify the beef, cabbage, peanuts n peppers; the extra mixture in the dish was just a little confusing. I also ordered #119 as suggested by the very nice waitress, I liked it a lot, not too sweet. Oh, one more thing, the portion is relatively large, so don't order too much food :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Food is delish. Atmosphere is just ok. But that's usually how these places can be.   So many menu selections.  The pad thai was very good and I'd get it again. We ordered it mild so it was not too hot. But if you like spicy this is the place! Also had the clear potato noodle soup. It was good, but several years ago it was even better - a little more on the sweet side. The original chef is back.  We were able to bring in our own drinks.  They provided glasses and they were dirty. So that's why only the four stars.  But it is one of the best places I've ever had Asian food. Good portions too.   Next visit we'll try something different."}
{"text":"I make excuses to come here.  I have never been disappointed and have consistently been surprised.  My (current) favorite is #42 on their menu: Spicy Khmer Ginger Noodle with added tofu.  #41A: Khmer Chha Bun Mates Kroup Mouk (wot?) is also stupendous.  My friend who samples Pad Thai everywhere he goes considers their pad thai to be one of the greatest he's ever had.  Portions are huge, especially for the price, takeout is available, the owners are friendly and the spices they use in their sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"This has quickly become my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. When my father comes to town, this is one of our meetup places for dinner. This and Sahara right down the street. The food is always outstanding. I have tried many different things on the menu and have been impressed by each. The dishes are all flavorful and exciting. I have tried bites from my brother's vegan dishes and they are equally as good. The server is also one of my favorites in Cleveland. She has a dead pan delivery and is awesome. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. I am lucky to live within 5 or so minutes from here. It is easy to order a $6 entree, eat half and have another nice meal for leftovers. You cannot go to a grocery store and buy all of this for the price you get here. The value is great. I urge you to go here tonight! I am not one to talk up a place for nothing."}
{"text":"I truly love this place! Awesome food, owners and price.   The Pad Thai is defiantly the best I've ever had and is by far the most reasonably priced. Definitely a little different then standard Pad Thai, but much more flavorful and unique. My girlfriend also got the Pad Thai and an order of the Beef Soup which she really adored.   Although the building is a bit deceiving the ambiance is nice and a significant upgrade from the previous restaurant's decor. I have also gotten take out quite a few times and the quality/portions are exactly the same as dining in.   No alcohol for sale, but they are BYOB. I would stick with beer unless you bring your own wine glasses though.   I urge everyone to try this Cleveland gem!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! I ordered the chicken pad Thai and to my great delight it was full of flavor. As other reviewers noted, this place has taken the the place of my old favorite Thai restaurant. One meal here was enough to get me hooked. 47a was very well made with homemade tofu to boot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The interior and the exterior could use a bit of renovation but the service is friendly and the food is amazing. The prices are pretty good too.   The best wonton soup I have ever had! The broth was very flavorful and it's full of big pieces of pork and what I can only assume are homemade wontons. The wontons are filled with a delicious filling and the noodles are nice and thin, not thick and gummy like the ones I usually see.  I got the #41 on the menu also. I've had the Chha Kreoung #114 as well. Both are delicious. They have different noodles but I think I prefer the noodles in the #41. They're both packed with flavors and nice fresh ingredients.   They have a huge menu that may be a little difficult to navigate but if you're at all adventurous you will find the large menu a lot of fun to explore."}
{"text":"A2 & surrounding areas have pretty great Asian restaurant choices--so using that as a benchmark for this review.   I'm not from Cleveland, I come to visit my s/o  & go try new restaurants. And I'm always craving some form of noodles or rolls...so reading all the rave reviews, decided to try this place for takeout.   Overall impression, decent food...not blown away. It's cheap. We ordered:   1- Garlic & Black Pepper Shrimp - good  2- Asian Basil Fried Rice (Beef) - average  3- Kuy Tiev Chaa (Shrimp) - dry, average  4- Appetizer Platter (the first one) - oily; good shrimp rice paper roll & fish cake  5- Guanabano/Jackfruit smoothie - average   The flavored were a bit muted, I expected it to be a bit bolder like Thai or Malaysian or even complex like Vietnamese...but it just kinda fell flat.   I will go back to dine-in next time to see what the owners recommend & if there's a difference in food taste/quality. Will post an updated review then. But I'm glad places like these exist in Cleveland...need there to be more though."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Always very fresh and full of flavor. The owners are so nice and helpful. They will adjust anything on the menu and offer insightful recommendations."}
{"text":"Cuisine Du Cambodge is some of the best Asian food I've had! The portions are large and the prices are low. Whether you want noodles, rice, or soup.. this is the place to come to!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the unique delicious smoothies!!!! We tried the coconut jackfruit and the soursop jackfruit ones. Perfect refreshment on a hot summer day. We also got some yummy noodle dishes, comparable noodles to other \"typical\" Thai places."}
{"text":"I've never been to Cambodia, Vietnam, or Thailand, so rather than being influenced by reviews exalting authenticity, which might not necessarily mean good-tasting to some palates---whether a Cambodian dish, a Thai, Italian, Mexican, French, Yugoslavian, Greek, or Samoan---I was convinced to try Cuisine Du Cambodge based on their impressive star power.  If it tastes so good to so many, I'm in.  And Annette, who took our order over the phone, was likeable, friendly, and helpful, making the best first impression.     Whoa.  We never expected to be so disappointed with our take-out menu choices.   I have to believe that two of our off-putting dishes were mistakes---not authentic.  They couldn't possibly have been what they were intended to be.        Although some were flavorful enough---Stir-fried Spicy Beef (43), Spring Roll, Shrimp Roll, and Egg Roll---these two were inedible.  Couldn't eat more than a couple of fork-fulls.    52 HOUSE SPECIAL MI CHHA (Lo Mein) . . .         noodles may have been stale (I've ended up         with stale myself, but tossed out after tasting         first---before adding to other ingredients),         or weren't rinsed well with cold water after         boiling.  Sounds odd, but true.  A residual         thing---especially with some ramen-style         noodles; or maybe it was seasonings---        incorrect, the ratio, combination of, or old  53 VEGETABLE FRIED RICE . . .         very greasy with a strange, earthy-like flavor;         may have been colored with turmeric, which,         if too much added---or old---will make a dish         taste unappetizing; too meager an amount of         peas and carrots           I may not be Asian, but I'm familiar enough with Asian dishes to know when results are successful or not---having prepared them for years, mostly Chinese, Indian, and Thai, using cookbooks from respected authors.        Even favorite, frequently-prepared dishes from highly-rated restaurants of any nationality/country, can occasionally fall short for whatever reason.   * purveyors not providing the freshest ingredients,     and owners unwittingly (or maybe not) using     them * unwashed vegetables/fruits   But there's another, more likely reason, for mistakes.  It could be as seemingly harmless as distracting the person involved in any of the prepping or cooking processes, if even momentarily.  That's especially risky with most Asian dishes, as the strictest attention is required because of the many steps, the necessary quick-fire speed, and the number of ingredients.  And prepping Asian foods involves more than most other types of foods.  After cleaning and trimming the proteins and vegetables, there's the chopping, shredding, steaming, boiling, egg-washing, dipping, breading, slicing, dicing, and even some pre-roasting, too.  Then all the measuring and mixing for various sauce preparations, plus readying all those distinctly unique and exotic seasonings, herbs, and spices to add to so many different dishes.  A lot going on.    Interruptions during any of these steps---especially the lightening speed cooking, saucing, and seasoning, demanding concentration and timing for even average results---can quickly turn a favorite into a flop.  Like their House Special Lo Mein.   \"House Specials\" should ALWAYS be as close to perfect as possible.   Ours even smelled bad.  Also...      Be VERY clear when ordering over the phone.  Repeat your order, PRICES too, if using their menu---or you might receive something that you didn't want.  When I ordered 43, Stir Fried Spicy Beef, I said I'd like the Vegetable Fried Rice with it.  (Clearly, right above 42 to 45, in bold, capitalized type under the \"Steamed Rice Dishes\" heading---it states \"$2.85 ADDITIONAL WITH VEGETABLE FRIED RICE\".)  To me, there was no interpretation other than this was a SUBSTITUTE for steamed.   But when my husband picked everything up, the total was about $2.00 more.  No big deal---prices may have increased.   Well, that wasn't the case, once I opened the containers.    They charged 4.75---not the printed $2.85---packing a FULL size of vegetable fried rice, and STILL packed the small container of plain steamed---what I didn't  want.  May have been a misunderstanding between Annette and whoever was cooking, but surely they don't ever offer upcharged rice to ADD even MORE rice to a dish that already comes with it, then charge FULL price for a FULL order.  Someone should have caught that mistake.  It was less than $2 more, but that's not the issue.  It's principle.  I wasn't in Thailand trying to figure out how to order from a menu written in unfamiliar characters.  I was a 15 minute drive from this Cleveland restaurant, ordering from a menu in English with US dollar amounts, taken by a fluent English-speaking person.    I might give them another try, but I'm wary.  I'd hate having to throw out more of their mistakes.  So far, nearly $15 worth is unappetizing enough."}
{"text":"There was only one cook when we were there for dinner, so each person in our group got their meal at a different time which made for an interesting meal together. More importantly, I found my meal greasy and not very delicious although it was edible but I opted not to take any leftovers home if that's any indication to someone who loves leftovers. My dinner companions came to the same conclusions as me about their selections as well.   My magic 8 ball advises \"outlook not good\" for returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars for unique food, great tasting food, and the interaction with the family who runs the place.   It was our first time here and we asked for recommendations for dishes that were Cambodian. The mother and daughter both offered suggestions and seemed genuine in trying to help us. The experience was very nice and even later on when the daughter came to ask how we like the food, we heard her go back and tell her mom that we had liked it, like the mom wanted to make sure we liked the suggestions. We talked with the server a little about her family being from Cambodia and the menu items and the other restaurants. She was so friendly, but not overly.   It was just a nice experience, this nice family sharing their special food from Cambodia, preparing it and being proud of it.   The food was very interesting! Some flavors being familiar but just with a unique taste. Very fresh ingredients, good portions. We got I think 41a and a stew with coconut milk and other stuff. Both recommendations. Then like two hours later I was jonesin for leftovers.   Food might tend to run spicy, not sure yet.  Thank you Mother and daughter!"}
{"text":"we almost turned around and left because this place looks kinda sketchy from the outside, but i'm glad we didn't.  the food was phenomenal, the owner was adorable, and his daughter (who was our waitress) was hilarious and sassy as heck!  try the chha bun kari kroup muk!"}
