{"text":"From a professionals point I can simply say that \"Belville Concrete is my go to concrete repair company and I very highly recommend them to all\".  James Belville and crew provide a fantastic concrete services for cutting, removal and resetting new concrete as well as other fine concrete related services (For Pools Too).   The first time I used them as a sub contractor, I knew that I would use them again (and I have, at least five or six times) James and his crew  worked the hours necessary to complete the project and they were off hours at that, between 9pm and 4am. They were Great! and I was more than able to meet my deadline of completion, they were impressive, quick and neat.  Working in the plumbing business, as I do, there are plenty of times I have need for concrete cutting and patching to be done, and I always use and refer my clients to Belville Concrete.   Their prices are competitive yet fair and his work is good quality, clean and professional as one would want. Don't waste your time looking for another you have found the right concrete company for your project large or small. Take it from licensed professional, they are really good! Two thumbs up and six stars if I may."}
{"text":"AVOID these unskilled crooks! I paid for them to do what should have been a relatively simple job leveling a bedroom floor. They came out the first day and did some grinding, requested payment and left. I came home and checked their work and realized the floor was still significantly uneven so I called them back out. During the call the owner said \"oh my guy didn't have his cornering tool...\" So basically they were going to let the job go unfinished and not say anything. Well they ended up coming back out later that week and doing some more work. I told the guy I didn't think it was flat still and he said he thought there was a low spot now and that he would come back later and fix it. He did come back and laid some cement and told me it should be all good now. Since the cement was still wet I couldn't check the work, but after it dried I checked and the floor was still uneven. I texted the owner who basically told me he wasn't going to come out and fix the work because his guy had already been there and he was not a \"miracle worker.\" Now I am stuck here trying to level this floor myself so I can finish this room. All I expected was an honest company who would do the work they were paid to do, but I guess that is too much of a task for Belleville. I hope this review helps you make the right choice in avoiding this company."}
{"text":"EXACTLY what James had promised. No schedule changes, on time, fair price, done professionally and good communication pre and during project. Good job Robbie! You are definitely my go-to guys for all things concrete."}
{"text":"If you are looking for stained-type of concrete work for inside your house or a building, avoid these guys completely.  Their prices are much, much higher than other companies.  Their work is a disaster, unskilled and horrible.  The grinding and preparation of the floors in my house was sloppy,  uneven and was not ready for color.  The stain type products they did use are highly toxic, the stain job  looked awful, and amateur, and the sealant was peeling up within days.  James disappears after the first visit.  The workers couldn't fix the bad job because they didn't know how to do it in the first place.  Since they don't know how to grind and prepare well, don't understand the chemical properties of the stains interactions with floors or the proper sealant choices for the floors, they couldn't fix them.  I had to completely redo my floors, including grinding and staining them, and they turned out terrific.   Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  Ask to see, in person, floors they have done before even considering using them.  That will make it obvious."}
{"text":"Professionalism and customer service at its' finest!  James came out to the house to provide an estimate - instead of suggesting unnecessary renovations he provided some alternative solutions which resulted in no immediate business for him - however I know who I will call in the future!"}
{"text":"Think twice before hiring these guys!!! they did a horrible job on my floors and claimed they were going to patch all crack and make repairs where ever needed. The patch work they did do is so bad and I am embarressed with what has been left of my floors! After spending nearly 3000.00 I may have to lay tile or hardwood to cover up..."}
{"text":"Called these guys to come and look at my garage floor.  The guy \"supposedly\" could not find the house even though I am on a major intersection in Phoenix. I even delayed a trip out of town that afternoon to wait for them.  They finally called back and he had me text him photos of the job.  Said he would get back with a bid.  It is now 2 weeks later.  Even though I have called the office many times the receptionist keeps saying, \"Oh!  He will do it tonight.\" Totally unreliable company, and, if you read the other reviews, I would say \"Don't even bother to call them.\"  I do not know what their problem is, but it will definitely not be my problem anymore."}
{"text":"I caution everyone about using these guys to repair your foundation.  He scarred off my buyers and cost me sale of my house and the purchase of my new home by telling them that we had extensive damage and was even rude to them while he was at my property doing the inspection. I have since had two other Foundation companies inspect the property and both of them have said that the damage is moderate and there is no current foundation issues and will better than new post repair.  Both of these companies are half the price and offered multiple year warranties for their work.  One of them said Concrete Repairman is using sub-par materials and doesn't do quality work, which from the other reviews, sounds about right to me.  Anyone that posted a 5 star review either got lucky or didn't shop around to see what other, more qualified companies are charging for this type of work.  Shop around and buyer beware!"}
{"text":"really james...you set up the appointment for me 2 days ahead of time...i switch my work schedule to meet with you, then i get a call right before appointment saying you wont be there at 9:30 but will be able to meet at 11:30 which i thought ok i can work around this...at 12:25 i get a call saying you will be another 30 minutes???  when i express that you have already started out on the wrong foot you just laugh and said then your not coming at all!   this is just rude!!! no customer service at all???  glad i didnt go with you...who knows how you would have been once you had my money...  please think twice before calling this business!"}
{"text":"Stained concrete bid came in over 2x higher than other comparable companies.  Shop around peeps!"}
