{"text":"La Mejor Barbacoa is a Mexican Restaurant located just outside of Old Town Glendale. The specialty of the house is the Lamb Barbacoa (BBQ) but they also offer a Taco Plate, Cured Meat Platter, Pozole Verde (pork soup), Huaraches (open LONG flat corn cake tortillas with toppings), long Quesadillas (some squash blossom, corn smut), Menudo, Caldo de Rez (beef vegetable soup) and Many Mexican Desserts.  This is a casual restaurant. You seat yourself and someone runs a menu over and takes your order. This isn't a fancy place but it appears to be spotless. It looks like it might have been a banquet hall at one time.  I tried the Huitlacoche (corn smut) Quesadilla. I received a very long nicely grilled quesadilla stuffed with lots of earthy huitlacoche, melty mild white cheese and two types of corn. It was very tasty. The house made green sauce went really yummy with this quesadilla.  My husband got the Bisteck Huaraches. He received a very long sort of open tortilla like corn cake filled with refried beans, green sauce, crumbling cheese and super tasty caramelized steak. It was VERY GOOD!  Service was great!  Everything was delicious, portions were very large and everything was very reasonably priced.  Really really good!"}
{"text":"In a word HUITLACOCHE! It's wonderful, if you haven't tried it, you should. It's hard to find so I was elated when I saw La Major Barbacoa served it. Yum yum yum!  The Green Pozole is just out of this world good. The chichiron on top is a terrific bonus.  I also cannot say enough about the staff. Just absolutely terrific people. Kind, inviting, and attentive. This is my go to spot for authentic Mexico City from now on!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!! We are picky about our barbacoa and consom√©, but this place was really good! It was packed too!! Surprised that they don't have any ratings yet."}
{"text":"Very authentic Food.  My family is from Mexico City and I moved here from Los Angeles and it's hard finding good Mexican food in Phoenix.  I'm so happy to have found this hidden treasure.  The Barbacoa was the real deal.  Hand made tortillas etc.  You can't go wrong. Take it from a real Mexican."}
