{"text":"I love bagels !  I went to there other location in Mooresville, for the first time yesterday. Had the wheat everything bagel toasted with butter. It was delicious.  They serve sandwiches, and hot breakfast eggs, bacon etc.  good place to go for breakfast and lunch.  I will have to check out the Huntersville location next.  And  there coffees are delish too nice selections!  will be back again !"}
{"text":"i believe these are the BEST bagels around! fresh every morning (fact). and although sometimes it gets very busy and they become a little slow, the food is great and totally worth it if you know what a REAL bagel is! Employees are very friendly and polite. They messed up my order once before, but offered to give me all my money back AND made me my correct order. The owners are wonderful people from CR and always have great stories! sandwhiches are huge and delicous! love it! DEFFINETELY would recommend going. they also provide BIALYS and lox spread AND tons of cream cheese flavors! and flagels!"}
{"text":"Place your order at the counter, pay, and be seated to wait for your food to be brought to you.  The process is slower than it should be and sometimes even annoying.  The bagels are very good, and there is a good assortment of stuffed sandwich combinations.  Sadly it is just impossible here in North Carolina to get the quality of deli meats you find in NYC or other northern cities, but for what is available here, this is good."}
{"text":"I have had several bad experiences here. I think the owner really needs to hire professional staff and train them. The Reuben Sandwich is really good! I would go back for that. However, because of the service I probably won't. On our first visit we were new to the area and painting our house, we went there and asked for two toasted bagel sandwiches, when we got home and went to eat them they were almost ice cold and not toasted, I paid like $15 for two lox and cream cheese bagels, ouch!! On another occasion, my wife and I arrived there at 2pm, they close at 3pm, after a long day of traveling we were hoping for some hot deli sandwiches, well the young gentlemen at the counter told us they couldn't because there grills were turned off. Really? You are supposed to be open for another hour and as a deli you cannot make a hot sandwich. I guess they wanted to go home early? We were willing to give it another try for breakfast, and yet again they mess up our order. I was multi tasking and didn't realize that they charged me for the more expensive bagels, and didn't even toast them this time either!! The kid at the counter did not repeat my order, I guess that was my mistake for not asking. I probably won't refer them to neighbors or friends for a good while. The food is good, when you get it how you asked for and paid for."}
{"text":"Charged me for more than I ordered. Then, order was wrong, then refused to give me back what I was overcharged for. When I opened my irder 2 items wete missing including what I had been charged for that I didnt order.  On top of that they didnt toadt my bagel or put butter on it as asked."}
{"text":"Yikes! I finally got around to trying a bagel here. Highly disappointed. The bagel tasted like thick white sandwich bread. It was dry and crumbly. I would even be disappointed with the quality if I purchased it from the grocery store. Also, WAY over priced. The people who made the bagel were friendly. However, the cashier was talking on his cell phone. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Never has gotten my order right. Never. For the last 3 years. Never. Service is terrible and the food is not what you'd expect for the prices. They really need to revamp the staff. They are rude and never listen."}
{"text":"The quality of product is not worth the cost, and more importantly, the customer service is consistently poor.    On numerous occasions I have been forced to return after taking out, to get my ordered fixed.  Today, I ordered 4 bagels, and received only 3.  My order wasn't that complex.  When I returned, they did give me my bagel without question, but the attitudes of the workers were simply unapologetic.  I'm not looking for empathy for my lost bagel, and mistakes happen, but it has been a consistent theme to our experience with this establishment.    It is not out of the question to expect good customer service, when paying for just that, a service.    This note is to simply warm people if they plan to eat here that your experience will not be overwhelming.  A suggestion to the business owners would be to take some execution notes from Dunkin Donuts, and some personality lessons from Chick-Fil-A!!"}
{"text":"Crappy service but the food was good. I really want this place to last and get better because Bagel Bin has lines out the door. I need more bagels in my life."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. We waited almost 45 mins to get 2 bagel sandwiches. When our food was finally brought to us no one apologized for the long wait, our food was just placed down on our table. I would not recommend this place if you have anything to do within an hour."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed with this place. My fiance and I went in this morning for some breakfast around 10:30am. There weren't that many customers inside, maybe 5 or 6 and none in the line, yet the staff were all super distracted and we waited to be helped for a good 5 minutes. I just dont understand how, with three people behind the counter, no line, and only a handful of customers (already seated), it took them so long to get to us. So we took our ticket up to the counter and waited another 5 minutes for someone to check us out. The entire staff overall were just unhelpful, slow, and not very friendly.  After that we got our drinks, sat down and waited probably 15 or so minutes for our bagels. We only ordered three bagels with cream cheese. Nothing fancy. And there had been no customers in line a head of us that would have caused a back up in orders.  The bagels themselves were okay. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not a quality I would go out and sit down for. I could have easily gone out, bought a bagel, gone home and made it for myself better and in less time.  Now with all that being said- they did have an extensive menu with more options than Ive seen at other bagel places. They had a really nice assortment of bagel and creamcheese flavors and their pastries looked really good on the counter. This place has potential, but I cant see myself going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"BEST bagels around! Their sesame bagels are better than store bought. I've always had great customer service and the food is consistently awesome. The Huntersville location is the best one"}
{"text":"My dad, husband, & I went there & loved it.  We each got something different & we all said we would defintely order each again.  They got sandwiches, a side of chili & I got a delicious salad with grilled chicken & bagel chips.  My husband said this would now be his go to place for a great deli sandwich - close, not so over crowded & noisy as the competitor & reasonably priced with nice background music!  Meeting some friends there tomorrow & my husband also has taken some of his colleagues & friends.  They also provided a variety of wonderful sandwiches etc for a church lunch a few months ago.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You will find me hear just about every Thursday and Friday morning when I am in town. Good bagels at a good price.  Their breakfasts are very large so come hungry if you want a cooked meal.  The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is that they have more bagel flavors than they have bins.  Every now and then, you can tell that my bagel has been sharing a bin with an onion or everything bagel."}
{"text":"This place is not worth it, shouldn't be allowed to have N.Y in the title. It was $35+ for three combo meals (one was a child combo) which is insanely over priced for the portions and quality, by quality I mean very low grade meat not Boar's Head or any other decent brand. I will not be going back since there are plenty of other options which are better quality and less expensive."}
{"text":"I tried their bages at the Cornelius, Jetton Cove Store, they had a small selection.  The bages did not taste fresh.  Seemed like they had been maybe frozen and thawed out.  Dry and dense.  I'll stick with Brueggers or Bages Bin, Native NY'r"}
{"text":"NY bagels is the closest bagel spot to me, so usually I go there out of sheer convenience. However, I do really like their breakfast sandwiches. I usually get a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. I appreciate that they actually fry their eggs and bagel on a griddle, unlike several other bagel places that microwave their egg. In my opinion, this makes a huge difference. Today I ventured out and got their Nova sandwich. It was really delicious and had a good amount of lox on it as well. It can get busy if you go once church lets out, but other than that I rarely have to wait. While there are better places in Charlotte (uptown area), this is definitely one of the best places in the Huntersville area."}
{"text":"Have to give 5 stars for the Cuban Sandwich. The Asiago beagle with house cream cheese. Yummmy! Customer service fair. Will definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My fellow New Yorkers.  BE REALISTIC.  We are NOT back home.  FOR HERE, this place is VERY good.  The food is great.  The prices are high.  The service is slow.  BUT===The food is worth the trip.  Try the crumb cake.  Also the Greensboro is a very good sandwich."}
{"text":"Nothing like a bagel from New York! I'm tired of places using the name to help sell their products"}
{"text":"We stopped at The Original NY Bagels this weekend.  And we were certainly glad we did.  After going through the normal list of fast food...nothing seemed appealing.  We glanced across the intersection to see this nice bright inviting sign and decided....what a better way to have lunch...than with a great deli sandwich or wrap!  So we ventured into the store.  Parking was really easy!  Ohhh...the feeling and aromas of a \"real deli\" really took us back to days in Philly when you could stop in...get a bagel with cream cheese or a great wrap! I had a sundried tomato wrap that was filled with honey turkey, lettuce and tomatoes.  My wife had a sundried tomato wrap filled with \"lite\" chicken salad!  As I glanced at all of the goodies in the many deli cases, there were so many other things to try....such as asiago bagels...and many varieties of cream cheese!  Mmmmmmmmmm...looked so yummy!   But since I had already ordered my turkey wrap....I settled for some Israeli salad which was a combination of cucumbers, tomatoes and other goodies in a vinegartte. Ohhh my goodness...I cannot begin to describe how yummy it was!  It was so good!    Both of our wraps were so good we had to share them as we drove off!  Really great deli and we are looking forward to getting back there very soon!  And....get there early...the deli closes at 4PM on weekdays."}
{"text":"I went in because I was sick and wanted something wholesome for my belly. I came in at 2:15 on a Saturday. They close at 3, but the woman with the short blonde had behind the counter told me their grill was off?! Seriously?! Why would a DELI turn their grill off before 3?? Trying to go home early I guess? AND the open sign was turned off at 2!! She was so rude to me and aggravated that I came in.  My everything bagel was hardly toasted. She warmed in for 20 seconds and then wrapped it Togo for me. It was not a yummy bagel. It was worse than the kind I can buy from the grocery store. GO TO BAGEL BIN!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I have been back a few more times since my original review, and things have improved. Customer service is much, much better. The bagels, thankfully, also taste much fresher than they did when they first opened. 3/12/2012    We're a bagel-loving family, so I was excited to hear about another bagel shop opening in Huntersville in a spot we drive past every day. However, I was sorely disappointed by their bagels. The selection looked great, and they had my favorite sun-dried tomato bagels, but the prices were ridiculously high for a baker's dozen.  The everything bagel was seasoned on both sides (which is why they get 2 stars instead of 1), but tasted like it was yesterday's bagel being sold as fresh. If I have to toast a fresh bagel for it to taste okay, then it's not a very good bagel.   They don't have a set price for a baker's dozen (it's not even on the menu), and the price for a dozen ranges from $10-$13, depending on how many 'specialty' bagels you include (like asiago, sun-dried tomato, spinach, etc).  It's a new store, and the employees were struggling with two customers at a time, not sure how they would deal with a crowd. But they were very nice, and I don't fault them for that, I'm sure those kinks will be worked out in the first few weeks.  The prices are higher and the quality much lower than our current favorite, Bagel Bin, so I doubt we'll be going back anytime soon for bagels. I may give them a second chance for a lunch wrap."}
{"text":"Alright, deleted the old review because they don't apply.  Fact is, this is a good bagel joint and we're lucky to have it on our exit.  I find myself craving their chewy egg bagels, and have really come to like the staff that worth there. They are professional and have become more friendly to me as I've stopped by more often.  Great folks. Great bagel. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The bagels are much better than the other options north of the city, not too bready and not too chewy. Also, they make REAL eggs, not those weird microwaved egg products that are cooked in plastic in a microwave. They have tons of options for breakfast that aren't centered around the bagel. Their lunch sandwiches are really good too and come with bagel chips! Do yourself a favor and go get a bacon egg and pepper jack on an everything bagel"}
{"text":"This place SUCKS.  It's a disgrace to the great bagel places of NY for this dumpster fire to call itself NY Bagel...1st of all, this place is so poorly managed it turns what should be at most a 5 minute process into a 45 minute painstaking ordeal which leaves you questioning yourself as to why you came in the first place with every click of their out of service clock.  Just went at 10am on a Saturday, which I understand is a pretty popular time to go get a bagel but the amount of time it takes and the complete lack of organization is appalling.  After ordering right away, we watched several people who came in a good 10 minutes after us come and go...on top of that the people that work here are so rude and unapologetic it's icing on an already dull cake.  When I finally got home an hour later, I was surprised (maybe I shouldn't have been) to realize my bagel hadn't even been toasted as I asked.  This may seem like a small detail, but when your bagels are comparable to a stale piece of bread- toasting is a must.  Needless to say I will never return to NY Bagel, and I may even lead a crusade to force them to remove the NY from their name...this place is everything a NY Bagelry is not- a slow, poorly run, rude journey to a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"I am a charlotte native and have never been to NY but the bagels here were ok not toasted well enough for me. The cucumber dill cream cheese was good but the price for the toasted plain bagel with smear on the side was A little pricey. Will try bagel bin next saw a few posts saying they were better"}
{"text":"They have such a range of bagels! Regular bagels. Flagels (flat bagels). Miniature bagels. All kinds of flavors, all kinds of good.   And the schmear! Many options, mostly very good. I'm not such a fan of their sweet cream cheeses, and I hate hate hated their bacon-scallion schmear because it was like biting into a big block of creamy salt. Ugh. But mostly they are very good.  This is a casual spot that feels like a traditional New York corner bagel place. It's bigger than it looks from the outside so it can accommodate a good number of guests, which is nice. They're kind of slow with their service, though, so don't expect to be able to come in and grab a bagel quickly on your way to something else. Waitstaff doesn't really go out of their way to be nice or accommodating, and I've had to wait on them to finish personal phone calls before they would take my order or let me pay for my meal.   But on the whole, this is a decent bagel place if you have time to wait and stick to tried-and-true basic bagel and schmear flavors."}
{"text":"Try Bagel Bin (or brueggers) one time and you will know right away that ONYB is NOT good bagels.     I have heard from people I see as credible that they get frozen bagels shipped in.  Also, they are not like new york bagels....i am from right outside nyc and frequently ate ny bagels my whole life so i'd know.    their owners allow their staff to be rude to customers and they do not compensate you when they mess up your order (even when they habitually do it)."}
{"text":"93 health rating. I really wanted this place to work out, because we love bagels! Their bagged bagel chips are great. But with 93 health rating, I doubt we will be back until the health rating gets better"}
{"text":"They have gluten free bagels. Everything Bagels!!! That's all that i needed to hear. One thing i never understand. And this goes with all gluten free food. Why are they always SO SO SMALL in size. If you're paying extra bc it's made with different flours why so tiny?  Anyway- one of the most decent tasting GF bagels I've had, especially at a bagel place. Plus you have many cream cheese to choose from! That's always a plus!"}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for 3 years and nothing about their bagels even remotely resembles the deliciousness of a New York bagel. They taste like frozen bagels you'd buy at the grocery store.   I wish that was the worst of my experience but the customer service was just about the most terrible service I've seen in a long time. I walked in to not a single person in line, yet about 6 people behind the counters not paying any attention to anyone. I waited about 5 minutes to order then another 5 minutes at the counter to pay for a $5, yes $5 bagel with cream cheese. Nothing else - no drink, etc. New York prices without the New York taste.   I wanted to like this place as its close to me but will not be back. Seems very disorganized with below average bagels."}
{"text":"After living in the area for 3 years, finally decided to try a bagel. When I walked it, the shop was vastly different than I expected, not bad, just different. Ordered a bagel with cream cheese.   I'm not a bagel aficionado, so take the following at face value: The bagel was just ok at best and seemed a bit flat. The cream cheese was decent. All in all, it was ok. Until I checked out and the total came to $5. For one bagel and cream cheese. No drink, no coffee, just the bagel. Seemed steep, but again, I'm no pro, so maybe that the going rate."}
{"text":"Love this place. Owner is awesome so are all the employees. If you go there enough, they will remember you and your order.  They make everything fresh so expect a five minute wait for your order- it's worth it. I get breakfast bagels and they cook everything on a flattop in front of you. None of that microwaved egg or bacon nonsense."}
{"text":"They're fast, clean, and make some good bagels. I've visited here a handful of times and it always hits the spot for breakfast. Since I was in the adjacent shopping center I figured I'd give it another go before embarking on the dreaded \"I-77S at 8AM\" gauntlet.  When you walk in you're immediately drawn to the massive case of bagels. They've got a ton of different flavors and if you look closely, most baskets even have 2-3 flavors each. I counted over 20 flavors this morning and they all looked fresh. You can get your bagel toasted or get it as is.  Cream cheese game is top notch. 15 fresh, homemade cream cheeses this morning donned the case. I wanted to try something new this morning so I opted for the sun-dried tomato cream cheese on an everything bagel. I also got a plain with strawberry. In and out under 10 minutes with 2 bagels to go!  First bagel was the plain with cream cheese. I agree with most people, authentic NY this is not. It's a great light 'n chewy bagel but I think the main component of a NY bagel is the water, which this of course lacks. Still the plain bagel satisfies most of the talking points. Well seasoned, well made, good size. The strawberry cream cheese is a flavored strawberry, and almost comically pink, still good but the best strawberry spreads are made with real strawberries.  The second, Everything bagel with sun-dried tomato cream cheese. This left a sour taste in my mouth. One of my favorite bagels in town is sun-dried tomato flavored from another shop, but the tomato is in the bagel instead of the cream cheese. This, just didn't work for me. It may just be me but the cream cheese was borderline sour, not astringent but sour. They have a lot of great spread options but I won't be getting this one again.  To those that are arguing that \"NY\" and \"Bagels\" are just part of the name, I still think it's a bit misleading. The place is called \"The Original NY Bagels.\" While the name might not reflect what you'll actually get, the usual flavors will still satisfy. I wasn't happy with the sun-dried tomato spread, but it's still a good shop overall."}
{"text":"Don't go. May be original but not NEW YORK. The bagels are 30 seconds from being raw. Might be ok for something other then bagels. People were very nice. Food trumps service."}
{"text":"Being from  NJ always on lookout for good Pizza, chinese or bagels in Charlotte area. Saw this place and thought w the name might be good bagels. Unfortunately not the case. Got a mixed half dozen . All terrible. None were properly cooked. While place was nice and looked like menu items were strong the main thing was the bagels. Cant reccomend this,place"}
{"text":"Honestly this is probably the worst bagel I've ever had. I would buy store bought bagels any day of the week than spend my money here. The bagel was thin and not tasty at all, and an insult to NY."}
{"text":"Ummmm, I like their bagels but noticed a new sanitation score of 80 today when I was in there. Yikes. Here's a link to the report. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION_VIOLATION/ShowVIOLATIONTable.aspx?INSPECTION=3298534&ESTABLISHMENT=154813&esttst_cty=60. The worst thing to me was storing raw bacon near deli meat. C'mon NY Bagels. Please get it together. I like the bagels."}
{"text":"Wonderful bagels , great service!! A very fir sly and laid back place for  a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the bad reviews...I wonder if they hired new people? We have never waited more than 5 mins for our bagel sandwiches and the eggs are actually cooked on a griddle, not in the microwave. The everything bagel is not over the top salty which I appreciate. My husband likes the Asiago cheese bagels. I would give this place another try if I were you!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. They have great breakfast sandwiches as well as deli sandwiches. The one guy is always here, don't know if he's the owner or GM or whatever, but he's always here working hard and makes you feel welcome. Great local feel! Normally I have my breakfast sandwich on a bagel, but today I tried it on a roll and it's FANTASTIC. The egg was cooked perfectly to, you can tell it isn't microwaved. Great way to start the day! And the price points on all of the food items are very affordable! With the quality of food you would expect it to be more expensive, but it isn't! Thanks for always providing excellent customer service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I never have had a \"NYC bagel\" however I do like bagels a lot actually. This place is a good spot if you want a warm breakfast that is not out of a microwave.  I normally get the #2 with eggs and turkey bacon, hash brown and a blueberry bagel.  I am going to break this down. Food Taste- 2 fried eggs, I mean can you really mess up a fried egg? It was what I expected nothing fancy. The turkey bacon is the \"Butterball\" brand which is also expected not the more cured turkey bacon. The bagel was toasted and buttered its was good but again I will eat a frozen grocery store bagel. The hash brown really underwhelming you know like the ones you will get at McDonalds. What made this experience a 4 was the price of the meal under $6! In addition the service, the young man greeted me with a smile and asked \"how my day was going so far\" mind you it was 6:50Am with no coffee yet. So my reaction was like whaaaaa (#zombie eyes) so I was kinda caught off guard. Overall it was a pleasant experience. This will be my go to spot for breakfast before work. Oh I found out the young (not bad on the eyes) man's name, Sebastian. So stop in and get you a cheap eat and a nice view ."}
{"text":"If you happen to be in the Gilead Road area of Huntersville and looking for a quick breakfast , this would be a good place to try. The Original New York Bagels is very 'New York' and is just like the local deli spots I've visited in New York. No real frills or thrills when you walk in . The focus is on the food, and I must say I was impressed by the menu. Of course there are at least 8 flavors of bagels ( the FRESH, warm kind that taste more like bread and less like plastic produced for the masses), and a variety of different flavors cream cheese. In addition to all of this, they basically have the griddle going to do any type of breakfast sandwich, breakfast meat you may want or pancakes. I also saw they had a deli lunch menu and lots of grab and go snacks. If you work in the area, this could kind of be your one stop shop for lunch, breakfast , coffee, and a snack to get you through the day. If you're in the area, this is your bagel spot."}
{"text":"Waited in line too long and walked out. You won't get my money today.  No thanks after the employee looked at me twice and never said I'll be with you in a moment. Never will I stop at this place again. Piss poor service and unorganized. I"}
{"text":"The people there are friendly but that's about as far as it went. If you're going to call yourself \"the original ny bagels\" you should serve a sandwich like NY. I'm born and raised LI. Even my husband, who's a CLT native said this was sub par to the places in Babylon. The bagels weren't toasted like we asked, and it had a quarter of the bacon and egg you'd get in a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok everyone, just because the words \"New York\" and \"Bagel\" are in the title doesn't mean it's going to taste like a NY bagel or whatever you associate with that caliber... it's just a name, so put that aside and judge on the \"here and now\"   Since my sister lives close by, I've actually found myself here many times before I recently moved to charlotte, so at least 10 times and I've never had bad service or a messed up order... don't get me wrong it's been slow at times when the line is out the door (not literally) and I have witnessed a wrong order a time or two, but it seems like they were responsive on fixing it.   Although the staff may not be the friendliest bunch, they seem like they are hard at work and always deliver delicious meals!  They have lots of bagel flavors to choose from and a variety of sandwich menu items to enhance that bagel! Personally I could go for the Bacon Cheddar Cheese bagel plain any day of the week and if I'm in a rush that is usually the order, but if I have more time I put some thought into crafting the perfect bagel sandwich!!  I'd say if you haven't been here, give it a try if you're in the area!! I've never been disappointed and it's one of my \"go-to\"s in the neighborhood. And if you've had a bad experience or went in a little too judgey, give it another shot as I hope you'll find it much more enjoyable the next time!"}
{"text":"The bagels are not really NY style, but the service is.... Went here a couple of times for a true NY deli breakfast sandwich and every single time I got a rude person to serve me. Have waited over 15 minutes the last time and there was just one person in line besides me. Not sure how they can still be in business which such bad service."}
{"text":"Moving from NY, you lose a lot of the food you're used to. This place solves my bagel dilemma. Has the look and feel of a NY bagel spot. Lots of variety in the kind of bagels you can get. The Cuban Sandwich is a must have"}
{"text":"I think the owners hire relatives to run the places.  The last time I went I ordered a salt bagel with cream cheese toasted.  I got a plain bagel with scallion cream cheese untoasted.  It took 20 minutes (I timed it because I had to be somewhere).  The cashier counted my $5 in ones 6 times and had to use a calculator to make change.  From the looks of it the place is just horribly disorganized.  They check people out in order.  That means if you're behind a family with a complicated order you wait until that is cooked and rung up.  If you get a long line of orders.....well there's my 20 minutes.  The food is fine (when you have it.  Serve me a day old bagel again and I'll cunt punch you), but you've got to step up the service guys."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, The Queen's sandwich is my go to. Very solid lunch spot."}
{"text":"A group that I am involved with decided to have a coffee and someone suggested getting bagels.  I volunteered to pick some up.  I called the day before my meeting and placed an order.  The folks on the phone were SUPER friendly and helpful.  I love the fact that they were open early enough, 5:30am, for me to pick up my bagels before my 7:00am meeting.  Everyone commented on how great the bagels tasted as well as the yummy flavors the for 4 cream cheeses I selected (with the help of the NY Bagel Staff.)  I will use them over and over again.  The prices were spot on!  I plan to use them for another event where I need lunch catered and will write another review for that.  So far I amm VERY impressed!"}
{"text":"I have now been here 4 times (giving them a few chances) each time my sandwich was made incorrectly.  The first time I received the entirely wrong sandwich. I drove back to the store from home and they didn't even offer a refund or a free anything for MY INCONVIENENCE.  How difficult is a roast beef and provalone on a kaiser w/ spicey mustard and all the raw veggies they have.  Subway seems to be able to do it.  Prices are high - $8.50 for a sanwich & chips.   Won't be returning anytime soon. ;("}

{"text":"Had a pretty gross experience at this Deli today. The place is unclean with a very dirty floor and soggy napkins shoved under wobbly tables. The coffee had solid things floating all in it and when I told the cashier he just threw the liquid In the sink and gave me the same cup. The coffee had gross solid matter in it yet again. I've honestly never been in a food place that was that unclean"}
{"text":"Love this place! You can tell the bagels are made fresh! The Asiago bagel alone has me coming back. The service needs to improve a little though, most employees seem like something is bothering them but hey you wanted NY bagel I guess you have to get the NY attitude as well lol"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this place for some time.  I love the food.  My issue is with the staff.  They are the rudest people ever.  The lead man behind the counter is a latin male in his 30's and he rolls his eyes at everything you say, he throws the pad on the counter, tosses your beverage cup AT you.  WTF?  This guy has serious issues and I'm done."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great service, seating inside and outside. Fast even when there is a line. You get a generous amount of food for the price you pat. We have been to several of their locations and have never had an issue. They are locally owned."}
{"text":"Three gluten free options! Lunch sandwiches are large, generous portions. Great place to grab a quick bite. Everyone working was accommodating and so very nice!"}
{"text":"My normal bagel stop is at Bruegger's, but for some odd reason they were closed this morning & decided to try this place as an alternative. I can honestly say that it was the worst bagel I think I've ever had. I've had better from the grocery store!! I'm certainly hoping the Bruegger's being closed is an isolated incident because I will not be revisiting here again for sure! I'm not even sure it deserves one star...they don't even have fresh brewed iced tea!!"}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at Bagel Bin, but wanted to try NY Bagels for something different.  While their bagels aren't as large as BB (they aren't really NY style, either), they fry your eggs on a griddle, so their egg sandwiches are IMO, far superior.  While we requested to get the bagels toasted, they were clearly not, but the softness of the bagels worked especially well with our egg sandwiches.  They also are very generous with cream cheese.  We'll keep returning just for those egg sandwiches.  Take out service is fast and efficient, too."}
{"text":"Prices are pretty steep, especially considering the food is decent at best.  At least one member of the staff has been rude to me each time I have been in there.  I don't go here very often but each time I leave and say I'll never be back again.  I think after this last visit I may actually stick to that"}
{"text":"Sub par food. Sub par service..... Employees actively arguing in front of customers. Argues with me about what I ordered? Really?  Bagel bin 10000 times better"}
{"text":"These are the most disgusting bagels in the Lake Norman region. I wish I had looked at Yelp before I went. I was running late and decided to take a chance. What a mistake. $4.00 after tax for a hard, flavorless everything bag with light cream cheese? No thanks. Go to Bagel Bin one exit up. I'm from NYC and a bagel snob and find most bagels down here to be terrible, but this place is the worst!"}
{"text":"Always stop by when in the Huntersville. Good bagels. Sometimes sold out of fav kind but other choices are good also. Tried the crumb cake. Warm it up a little and eat with a good cup of coffee, yum."}
{"text":"Just started coming here. I am addicted to the gluten free sesame bagels and my husband loves the bacon & cheddar and Asiago bagels.  Love their cream cheese too. The sandwiches are delicious and filling. The Cuban is very authentic and amazing but a little greasy for me but my husband loves it. Love this place and it stays pretty packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"This  review applies to the CORNELIUS location only. I went into the location shortly after noon on Monday and after standing at the counter for over a minute and did not get as much as a \" Hello!\" or, \" I will be right with you.\" I turned around a walked out and went to another place for lunch. The place was not busy. One male behind the counter was sampling food to a customer and could have easily acknowledged my presence. Another male walked by me and  back into the kitchen with out even making a sound.  Just make a customer feel like they are welcome in your store and I will not mind waiting a while. Your food looked yummy but I refuse to spend money where I feel like I am invisible."}
{"text":"My friend and I went by on a less busy day and it was absolutely fantastic. All of the employees were very friendly and the bagels were DELICIOUS. WAY WAY better than what I've had at Brueggers and Bagel Bin. I am not sure why others had such diff experiences. I think a lot of the people in this area are just on their high horse and expect a presentation everywhere they go. The store was clean, employees were helpful and kind, and bagels are awesome."}
{"text":"The bagels are good but the service is TERRIBLE. The people helping the front are so rude!! We will not be going back there."}
{"text":"No where near authentic NY Boiled than Baked Bagel!!!! GOOD PLACE TO grab a quick bite for breakfast.  Love that they have turkey bacon!!! Customer service is always good though...."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick breakfast sandwich.  I usually order a bacon egg and cheese on plain bagel.  No complaints.  Quick and tastes good.   Coffee selection leaves a little to be desired as sometimes it's not fresh.   Atmosphere is a little awkward - but you can eat in peace if you pick one of the high top tables towards the back.   Not the most friendly staff, but they are quick.   Parking is sometimes hard to come by but you can usually park in the middle of the lot and walk over. I've only left due to no parking once."}
{"text":"So being a NYer and Jewish i have to give these guys deserving credit. Spoke to the owner, he sold bagels in NY for 20 yrs. true they are softer, less crispy then NY, but he told me they were when he first opened here but the customers complained so he adjusted to local taste. Easy fix, i got it double toasted and it was great. Nice people working here too. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I love The Original NY Bagel!  They have other locations in Mooresville, Denver, Terrell, and now Huntersville.  We used to always go to the Mooresville location even though we live Huntersville.  We tried all the bagel places in Huntersville...not good...until now!  I used to work in Mooresville and my hubby used to drive me to work just to have an excuse to go The ONYB.  Their bagels are yummy!  But we love their wheat bread!  My hubby always gets ham, egg, and cheese on wheat.  I like to step out of the box usually, so I get turkey, egg, and pepper jack on wheat...YUMMO!  Lunch is super delish too.  When you order a combo meal you get the sandwich, a side salad (potato, macaroni, fruit, etc.), chips, and a pickle.  I do have to say that since they've opened in Huntersville, the service is a little slow.  But hey, they are in a new location with new staff.  What else can you expect?  Hopefully the owners will crack their whip on their staff soon.  I'm willing to be patient with them since I know the owners are very personable and caring at their other locations...and so should you :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I will be back after my last couple of visits. I understand busy weekend mornings but waiting 20 minutes for 3 un toasted butter bagels is ridiculous. The last time I was there was an hour for closing time and my daughter wanted a bagel for lunch. When we walked in, there were no bagels in the case and I asked if they were out. The girl working said no that they had plain and some other varieties. I specified I wanted 2 plain bagels not toasted, one with butter and one with cream cheese. There was no one else in line and one couple waiting for their food at a table. Again it took AT LEAST 20 minutes to get my bagels. And they were toasted. As I waited one employee counted the cash drawer, one was cleaning, and two more kept walking around behind the counter and going into the back. I didn't understand the problem and asked what was taking so long and got a curt response. I actually checked my bagel for spit before eating due to their odd behavior."}
{"text":"As somewhat a creature of habit, I eat at the Firehouse Subs in this same set of shops a good deal.  I've always seen NY Bagels but thought, looks like a chain (I do get how ridiculous that sounds given the Firehouse reference!), probably not that great, blah, blah.  But...!  Thanks to my need to hit my Yelp 100 Challenge goal this year, I've been breaking some habits in order to get some new reviews under my belt.  I was quite glad I stopped in!  First, technically, it is a chain with locations in Mooresville and Denver.  As I entered I got the feel of one of the deli's I would frequent in South Florida when visiting my sister in law and that was a really good start.  Felt that way from both the visuals and the smells.  I ordered a pastrami and corned beef with swiss and Russian dressing on a toasted onion bagel and really had no idea how it would be served.  Turns out the meat was grilled and piled high with crispy edges atop the bagel with some tasty cheese and yummy dressing.  It was a 10 napkin sandwich to say the least but was well worth the wiping.  Just delicious!  Only negative was the toasting led to the onions on the bagel being little pieces of charcoal but, that didn't wind up being too bad of a thing in the grand scheme.  I plan on stopping by for lunch today to try something different and perhaps get a combo with one of their salads and some chips.  Quite looking forward to the visit!"}
