{"text":"I can't believe its taken me this long to stop in this fine establishment.
If you want a super fancy atmosphere then this isn't for you.
But if you enjoy DELICIOUS, quality fish and chips, this is the place!
Fresh battered fish, nice and crunchy, good sized portions.
Not over seasoned or over salted in any way & if your taste buds are missing something, theres a whole bar of different sauces for free!"}
{"text":"No-frills place, with good fish and chips (and oysters, and shrimp, and crab legs)... It's definitely a dive, with prices to match, but the portions are generous and the breading on the fish -- the most important part! -- is crisp and perfect. Skip the chain restaurants when you have a yen for fried seafood and check out this Phoenix local instead."}
{"text":"My grand parents came here back when it was called \"lazy Lew's\" back in the 50's. The place is a total dive but it's fitting and its in an industrial part of phoenix. However the food is great and so is their home made hot sauce"}
{"text":"After driving past this whole in the wall countless times, I finally went in & tried in. I got a piece of fish and the rocky point shrimp cocktail.  For the fish, fried is fried and the batter wasn't anything special. It definitely needed salt.
   But I'm a sucker for a good Mexican shrimp cocktail or ceviche & knock kneed didn't disappoint. It was flavorful & not too spicy. Decent portion that was full of shrimp.  
Knock Kneed would not be first on my list for fish & chips but I'd go back for the non-fried"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and I've ordered 2 Fish and Chip. Fish are hot and good sizes but there's NO Taste. No salt or pepper. Definitely not going back.... I can cook better than this place."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Knock Kneed Lobster!

It really is a dive, but Jeannie behind the counter is one of the kindest people I have ever met in food service.  We had the King Crab Legs for only $15.95 with 2 sides.  Most of the side choices are deep fried, but the were all hand breaded and prepared when ordered. NO frozen and fried side orders here like most every other place you go.  This no-frills \"joint\" prepares each meal for the customer as they arrive.  I doubt that they even own a heat lamp.  Oh BTW...  Our meal was GREAT!  I shall return

----------------

Ok...  I returned...  Had the Grilled Lobster!  Never had lobster on a paper plate, but it didn't take anything away...  Two bites in and I forgot the paper plate and plastic \"silverware\". What a delicious treat!

-----------

I LOVE this \"Hole-in-a-Wall\"

The fish is what most people order...  So I tried it.  Another Winner!"}
{"text":"I downloaded the yelp app solely for the purpose of writing a review to warn you of the bad service I received at knock kneed lobster. The staff was rude and had obvious difficulty taking my order. Instead of apologizing and redoing my order, they were rude and overcharged me. The manager insisted she couldn't edit my order. HORRIBLE SERVICE. And the name of the restaurant doesn't even make sense because they only have one lobster item on the menu. ZERO STARS"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best fish joint I've tasted in Phoenix. Their fish and chips are well-breaded and delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We saw the yelp reviews and decided to try it 
WOW it was great!
The crab legs are worth it and so is the cajun talapia
The garlic mashed side was great and the grilled shrimp was delicious
Definitely a local dive restaurant with good food on plastic plates... Give it a try"}
{"text":"Strange...the reviews seem to be all over the place  for this the best seafood joint in town.  I think their 60 year operation speaks for itself.  I've been a semi-regular for years now and love their fish.  It's the best breading I've ever tried.  Almost as important as the fish, to me, is you must have good tartar sauce.  If it's crap you can have the best fish and you've still lost me as a customer.  KKL does it right....best, freshest fish and the best tartar in town.  A few have mentioned that it's not in the best neighborhood.  What does this really mean?  Does location have some effect on a restaurants ability to cook food?  Or does your concern for it's location say more about you..."}
{"text":"I've been going to knock kneed lobster since I was 5 years old. I am 31 now.  My parents have been eating at knock kneed their whole lives. I got my wife hooked and her parents hooked. It just takes eating there one time to know that they have the best seafood around. The outside of the building looks a bit rundown and the inside it a little bit older but when it comes down to the food your taste buds are in for a treat.  I will fight anyone who eats there and doesn't say it is the best!"}
{"text":"My parents used to eat here a very long time ago. I have eaten here sporadically over the years as well. I can say that the quality took a slight dip a few years ago, and the breading on the fish always seemed to fall off the flesh. The prices and serving size of some of the sides seem a bit out of whack, but in general, it's better than Pete's Fish & Chips. We are living in a desert, so I cut them some slack. It's a decent place to go for the type of state we are in."}
{"text":"By far the worst crab legs I have ever had. I should have known because the price was low. They came out dry and the meat was stiff. Was like eating crab leg jerky. 
I saw someone rave about the hush puppies. If you like them tasting like salsa then they would be great for you. I believe they mix salsa in the batter because they taste like Mexican hush puppies. I love Mexican food but when I am eating seafood and hush puppies I don't want to taste Mexican food.
I will say the only highlight was the fried zucchini. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Where is the negative 2 stars button?  

They take cheap fish, we assume they thaw it before throwing it on the floor for the flavor, and into the grease (which smells lovely by the way).

Then, they serve this bland, unseasoned \"food\" to you and laugh all the way to the bank.

No taste buds?  This is the place for you!  The last time I entered was was cuz purely by accident.  The next time will be duck hookers and bullets....  Never again on purpose.  There's not even any cats near their dumpster.  Animals have keen 7th senses.

They owe me $12 and 40 mins of my life back!  And ppl thought Pete's was bad?"}
{"text":"The prices are good and the food is excellent. I love the fish and chips but the fried mushrooms are my favorite. It is a great place for the whole family."}
{"text":"After months of passing this place and wanting to try their food, we finally made it to KKL.  What we weren't expecting from this place was the very pricey menu for fish, shrimp and chips (french fries from a bag, I'm sure)!  The shrimp was different and tastey, I had 4 pieces with chips and also a side of mushrooms.  Chris had clams, chips and a side of cole slaw and of course we ordered the hushpuppies which everyone raves about.  This meal was close to $30 dollars!   Some people may feel that isn't bad for lunch at a seafood place, however for the area the food, which isn't like just from the ocean, it's from a bag - it's way too much money and your gut will feel like a grease pit after eating here!

My advice, skip this place if you can!"}
{"text":"Had the 2 pc. fish & chips. Fish was very fresh. Batter was good and crunchy. Fries we ok because they were fresh, but underwhelming. The cole slaw was pretty much like what you buy at the deli counter. My friend had the fish and chicken tenders. Skip the chicken. Overall I was expecting a bit more from most of the reviews."}
{"text":"Their fish n chips are sooo good!! I was raised on them, when there were more locations with the chain. But on the other hand, their fried zucchini is awesome... And their cocktail sauce is the best!! ;) still have yet to find a place that matches their fish n chips... Will always be going to Knock Kneed"}
{"text":"Fish and chips were good and so were the fried oysters. My girlfriend tried the grilled shrimp and they were tasteless and overcooked.  The fried zucchini and mushrooms were very good. We will be returning."}
{"text":"The fish is above average, not great. The hush puppies however are amazing. They have a nice selection of sauces to choose from and premium beers are only $3.25!"}
{"text":"Have known this place has been around for quite some time and have always said that we needed to try.  Well, finally had a chance to do so and I must say I was pleased.  Now I'm thinking what took so long?

Ordered the 2 pc fish with chips.  The fish, nice sized pieces of cod, with a nice and crunchy coating was delicious.  My friend's son, who's 13 and just released from hospital wanted to go to lunch, got the 2 pc fish, 2 pc shrimp and chips.  The shrimp were large sized and he enjoyed it tremendously.  I was surprised he ate almost everything.  

Though we live in Goodyear, will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was very bland. I like to have a little bit of flavor aside from the sauce that I put on but this fish didn't have it. It seemed fresh, just lacking. The fries were disappointing too. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Found this place on way back of Pueblo Grande Museum.  Fried fish and everything else at its best.  Packed with Friday lunch crowd.  Took carry-out which was fast and hot.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great shrimp that has a wonderful crust.  Always the large gulf shrimp you love.  Just added fish tacos which are decent but the shrimp is really why you come; and the fish is great too."}
{"text":"My family and I had just moved from the state with the cleanest air and the freshest fish.... ALASKA. 

Thus, the reason we were ignorantly walking on Van Buren St. We had no idea it was a little sketchy. But what did we see? A restaurant that said Seafood? Let's go!

And we have never looked back. 8 years now, my family has been enjoying the consistently delicious fish and chips. We never go to any other fish place when KK gets it right every time. 

Be adventurous and try it out! What's a little ghetto neighborhood?"}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips. Big portions and friendly staff. If your doing take out call ahead it will be much quicker. Try the shrimp they are huge and fresh."}
{"text":"Fish is too thick for batter. Not best tasting but the fish tacos and the onion rings are good."}
{"text":"Part 1: customer service was awful. It took me about 3 min to place my order. The woman behind the counter must of been having a bad day. My first time there so I walk up and begin to place my order I then asked the woman to fry the zucchini a little extra not knowing that's how they cook their food. So she starts to push buttons and has a little attitude about it. Then I ask for the fish to be cooked well done, again she has an attitude about me requesting how I want my food cook. Mind you my first time and it only took three min so I wasn't holding up the line. 

Part 2. Food was cool no flavor that just pops out at you but there's a nice variety you can chose from. Taste wise average. 

Do I recommend no."}
{"text":"Love their fried fish with fries and the endless supply of ranch. Oh sooo good! The price is right, the service is ok. There's room for improvement. Call in your orders during rush hours."}
{"text":"I only went to this place once but can't wait to go again when I am in that part of town.  It's a little bit of a drive for me.

The fish was excellent-- the best I can remember eating..  So was the tartar sauce and cocktail sauce and hushpuppies.  I went with a large party and we all had our food quickly and everyone liked their food.

You order at a window and then are called when your order comes up but it doesn't take long and your food is served hot out of the fryer.

It's in a little bit of an industrial part of town but I guess that's because they have apparently been there forever!  When I have visited a few more times I expect to bump it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"It had been close to 30 years since I last went Knock Kneed. But from what I do remember the food was great, it has not changed one bit. I had the 2pc fish and chips with a side order of Cole slaw. (homemade and delicious). 

The fish was huge and cooked to order, it actually fell apart when I picked it up. We arrived around 5pm, there was plenty of room. The only thing is I wanted to order their 3 fish taco platter, but I found out it is not served on Fridays. That was my only disappointment."}
{"text":"We had a family lunch today. The staff allowed us to reserve (without advance notice) the back room. We all had a great lunch. It was everyone's first time (except the wife and me). Everyone really enjoyed what they ordered.  There was 17 of us (10 adults and 7 grand children).  I wish the whole family could have been there..
I had not in my 20 + years ordered or seen the hamburgers they serve there. They are huge!  A couple of us don't care for fish. Anyway they said the burgers were great.

Thank you Knock Kneed Lobster for a great lunch and for the great service and friendly atmosphere. You helped make a good memory."}
{"text":"If you want good fish and chips this is the place. hand filleted  very light batter on the fish, fries are old fashioned not processed and frozen elsewhere. The only place that compares is Spud Fish and Chips in Seattle WA on Greenlake.

These are the best fish and chips in the World!"}
{"text":"The staff was very kind and my party felt welcome. The menu had many options. We like variety so we ordered fish n chips, king crab legs, fried catfish, hush puppies, fried mushrooms, fried okra, and fried zucchini. Everything was fried perfectly and was not too salty AND WAS NOT GREASY OR DROWNED IN OIL. The proportions were above average and the prices were more than reasonable. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone living in or visiting the Phoenix area. We all look forward to returning to Knock Kneed Lobster!"}
{"text":"Wife pointed me in the direction of this place since she had eaten there before.

I must admit I was a little leery of the place at first. The place looks like a dive: across from a strip joint in a pretty industrial part of town. The decor is straight out  of a recycled beach restaurant from the 80's and when I got a peek at the kitchen I wondered if I was going to have to visit the bathroom in a hurry after being done.

Well, never judge a book by its cover.

The food was really good: the garlic mashed potatoes were made from scratch and delicious, the fish n chips were light and crispy, not greasy.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was raised on Pete's Fish and Chips, but because they just don't do it for me anymore  I decide a few years ago to look for a better fried fish joint. With yelps help I found a number of restaurants in the valley.  They were all serving better seafood.  It cost more money but always worth the higher price. I would say this place is the best so far. I was told they fresh cut their fish filets everyday and the shrimp are a fairly good size. Very taste food. This place has probably the best tasting cocktail sauce I have ever had. I used it on both the shrimp and fish. Didn't care for the tarter sauce."}
{"text":"My Sister-in-law's mom forces her and my brother to take her to Knock Kneed Lobster every time she comes into town from Baltimore.  We met up with them .

2 piece fish and shrimp w/chips.  They even have pasta for the vegetarians!  The Mizithra Cheese Pasta was WAY WAY WAY better than The Spaghetti Factory!  We got a side of hush puppies...SOOOO YUMMY!  

WAY WAY WAY better than Pete's Fish and Chips (which is still good).

There is only 1 problem ... no Diet Coke ....Pepsi products :("}
{"text":"Over priced. Not very friendly. 
The place is A dive. 
Better deal some place else !!!"}
{"text":"Divey (heh get it? Dive-ey in a seafood restaur... Never mind), with lots of parking and seating. My fish was moist with crispy breAding, but the shrimp were dry little things. I also tried their fried mushrooms, zucchini, and hush puppies--all ok, but nothing really special. They do have a condiment bar so you can get as much sauce as you need. The place you go when you want to get crispy fried things."}
{"text":"Since I recently moved, I pass this restaurant on my way to work every day. I decided to take my husband there and try it out after reading the many positive reviews on this website. We hoped the food would be just as good as a restaurant that has also been around for many years in our Colorado hometown where they serve fabulous shrimp, chicken and french fries. I have to say that, although there were many happy people eating here and the staff was incredibly friendly, we didn't think the food was good at all. My husband had fish & chips, and I had shrimp. The breading was SO thick and grease-laden, you could hardly taste the fish. Really unhealthy. Sorry, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Do I really have to give them even one star? 

In the area so i dropped in for a quick lunch.  Had the shrimp plate with fries. Here goes:
1.  The prices are outrageously high considering location, restaurant decor and quality of food. You cannot have lunch here for less than $11 unless you order one shrimp.  Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.
2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape. This is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middle and almost split it to make it look longer.
3.  The shrimp had too much batter.  At one point the \"shrimp\"( what was left of it after I took a bite), came out and the \"barrel of fried batter\" was left
4.  The french fries were from a bag --frozen.
Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.  This place makes Long John Silver seem like a 5 star restaurant and it's a lot cheaper too.  
It is an outrage as a \"restaurant\".  All they do is fry up every piece of seafood that YOU can buy frozen at CostCo or Sam's.
Don't do this to yourself.  When you are in the area and hungry, go to the Jack in the Box across the street or some other fast food place. You'll be better off. 

and.... I cannot believe that the people who gave this place 4  and 5 stars are for real. They have to be the relatives of the owners.  There is no other explanation."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, dont let the ugly old building fool u! As a little girl, my mom would always bring me here when they were located in Mesa. When they closed down I was so upset because I loved the food! Then we found out they reopened again in a new location in Mesa, still and changed the name to Sullivans Pier. I must admit it was not nearly as good at all. That place also eventually went under. Then I dont remember how I found about of this location but Ive been here a few times and the food is AMAZING!! The chicken strips and fries is what I always order. I could remember they were still as good and tasty as they were when I was growing up, and all the sauces are excellent! The food is awesome! But I must say, the service SUCKS!! The girl who took our order was pretty rude. But it wouldnt stop me from coming for the food haha."}
{"text":"The Best Fish and Ships by far this side of the East Coast.  :)"}
{"text":"I can not give my opinion on the fish cause I only get the shrimp cocktail and hush puppies. I just can't get passed it. I have to order them. If my view on the menu is limited then so be it. As far as the shrimp cocktail and hush puppies are concerned. I love this place."}
{"text":"BLUF: The Fish just tasted a bit bland but the shrimp was OK. 

Service was friendly and efficient and I liked how they had all the condiments laid out. It seemed clean inside with a rustic fish shack feel. I ordered the 2 and 2 (fried fish--cod I think & shrimp). Shrimp was good but the fish (the meat itself) lacked flavor. The breading was fine and seasoning seemed fine. It's the fish itself just seems like it's been frozen too long or as if it has been soaking in water and just leached all of the flavor out of the flesh. I don't know how else to describe it. I'd say this place is definitely a step up from Pete's and I can't really think of any other \"fish and chips\" places around town that would compare other than Petes. I'm from the Seattle area originally so maybe my expectations are too high. I really wanted to love the food here but I feel if I came back I would only get the shrimp. Maybe they can look into another supplier for their cod. Pete's isn't even really fish and chips in my opinion because the fish they serve is essentially what you get in a frozen food aisle at the grocery store....processed chopped up and repacked into squares then breaded and fried. At least here at Knock Kneed the fish appears to be in a fillet form."}
{"text":"I love this place! I don't even live nearby and I will drive to Phoenix when I am craving fried fish and shrimp. It is tasty and always served real hot. They have a variety of condiments too so you can eat your food however you like it. The fish tastes fresh to me and delicious.  It definitely is a little dive but very welcoming."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place a long time.  My father a native has never been here.  He is a huge fish and chips fan.  There were a few of us for this trip.  Everyone agreed their food was good.  I got the two piece fish and chips with 2 pieces of shrimp.  It was good.  That hot sauce that is served with it too is really tasty.  Looking for a local place that has good fish and chips stop here."}
{"text":"I love fish and chips!  We were in the area (visiting Phoenix Ale) and decided to try the fish and chips. The fish tasted good but the batter had no flavor. No seasonings at all. I think the worst I've had in the valley. The fries weren't anything special. It was very busy so I guess a lot of people like it. The staff was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I thought Knock Kneed was pretty good.  Although a bit pricey for what you get, I think the ingredients are pretty quality.

What I did notice about the fish is that it doesn't taste super fishy.  Not sure if that's good or bad for you but for me it was great.  I'm not a person who really likes much seafood as I feel it's always too fishy for me.

I got a combo with two pieces of fish.  The breading was outstanding and the hush puppies were dynamite as well.  I'd probably go back just for the hush puppies.  

The condiment bar is a nice touch as well.  You can get all the cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, hot sauce and malt vinegar you want.  Love it.  I got all those.

The cole slaw was pretty decent.  I'm 'A-OK' with this place but I'll probably have to make another visit before I up the star quotient.  

Ambience,..?  Uh...it's alright.  I like the open window lighting.  But the 'hood aspect of the location gets five stars from me.  Two strip clubs within walking distance.  Well, allllright.

Pretty good."}
{"text":"I've gone here for years, but tonight I lost a lot of respect. 
 1) Pepsi was carbonated, so gave us cans, but refused to give us refills but could with any other flavor, aggggh I don't want the other brands. Just give me another can of Pepsi what's the big deal.
 2) Customer comes in 20 minutes before closes and cashier tells customer can't eat in, closing in 20 minutes. Customer says I can eat it in 20 minutes, nope sorry. Wow since when do you dictate where one eats. 
 3) 10 minutes before closing, over intercom an announcement, closing in 10 minutes. YEAH OK let me eat and choke on my shrimp so I can sue you....who does that? I'm surprised they didn't go to each table and tell everyone to leave. 
 I guess that's the new level of service they offer. F THAT...we drove over 35 miles for that. Sorry, your food is good but it's not that good. Back to Joe's Crab Shack...."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place for years and finally stopped in today. I don't give too many 5 Star reviews, but wow what a great place!

When you walk in it feels like you just stepped off a fishing boat into the dockside restaurant with \"Fish Shack\" Vs. Mexican Seaside type feeling. The place is very roomy with lots of seating, has a nice outdoor patio with smoking and non-smoking sides and a large parking lot.

Order at the counter window and be prepared for some golden battered goodness when they call your number. Get your condiments ready, take your ticket to the window once the magic number is called, and BAM! Flaky, moist, battered goodness is now yours to claim!

Everything was made at the time of order, not heat lamp fish sitting around getting stale. They boast \"The Best Fish Tacos in Town\" well I've heard one before and me being a sucker for a fish taco ;-) I took them up on the offer along with a 1pc Fish & Chips.

The verdict? I agree on the fish taco it was fantastic and piled high with all the fixings and aside of mango salsa. The 1pc you ask? Equally as good - you won't leave hungry even if you get the 1pc.

Stop by and check this place out, let me know and I'll come join you there! I still need to try the homemade Hush Puppies!!"}
{"text":"This is the best fish and chips in the valley, hands down. Don't risk the stomach ache of going to Pete's Fish n Chips; come to Knock Kneed and you most definitly will be more than satisfied."}
{"text":"The Knock Kneed Lobster in Phoenix Arizona reminds me of that crazy uncle or aunt we all had when we were kids- you know the one who tried to be cool but just couldn't pull it off. You were mortified and totally embarrassed if your friends were around!  but you still looked forward to spending one on one time with them because underneath all that nerdiness and failed attempts at being cool- you know they had a heart of gold and you really loved them. That is how I feel about this place. You have to get past the plastic  seagulls hanging from the ceiling and the neon light in the shape of a shark dangling in a waterless fish tank. You have to overlook the ceramic mini lighthouses brought from the QVC channel and the clay starfish made in a sixth graders art class. If you close your eyes and concentrate on the smell of the food- you may forget you are in a Seafood restaurant in the middle of an industrial complex in a desert fifty feet from the train tracks- you might just hear waves crashing on the shore or the fog horn of an approaching fishing trawler. Alright- enough with the \"fluff\". This place has decent fish! It has a decent beer selection as well! Except for sipping on a $3.25 cold bottle of Bud- I felt like I used to when I was a kid and my Dad would take me to Howard Johnsons- squeezing a dozen lemon wedges over a half pound of golden fried clams eating malt vinegar fries with a tub of fresh coleslaw! All this for under $13! The fries were crisp and golden- I hate soggy brown fries! The coleslaw tasted like it was just made- the cabbage still had great crunch to it- I hate mushy Cole slaw! They have a great self service bar- different types of vinegar, fish sauces, and a whole tub of lemon wedges! I would have given them five stars- but being from the gulf coast of south Florida, I kept thinking I was in a Red Lobster wannna be where all the interior decorations were obtained from a garage sale in a retirement village! I do recommend!"}
{"text":"I have come here before several concerts at the Celebrity Theatre.  I can always give most restaurants a second chance or sometimes a third.  But this place is just awful.  Service is sub par.  The cocktail sauce is way too spicy and watery.  Fried zucchini and mushrooms are alright, but nothing to terribly special.  Hushpuppies are good I will give them that.  the fish and shrimp are overpriced and way too heavily breaded.  and my brother in laws baked fish smelled just god awful.  won't be wasting my time or money at this dive again."}
{"text":"Their ranch is the best. Everything seems fresh for fried food and not too greasy! It's a very casual restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the baked cod with hush puppies and steamed broccolis. They were delicious and perfectly cooked. Defitnely will be coming back to try other items. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For the past 15 years or so, I have been a satisfied and happy customer of KKL.  I absolutely love everything about Knock Kneed.  The fish is among the best that you will find in the Phoenix area.  I am also a big fan of the okra.  

The ambiance here is also quite enjoyable.  There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and the nautical themed decorations make it one of a kind.

You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Been driving past it lately and had to stop in. Dive yes, but that's ok. Food was just about average, nothing special. Very bland unless you call fryer oil an herb or spice. Needs some sort of ambiance, a little pirate, \"Shiver me timber, aaaaargggh music\". Chowder was not creamy but milky, maybe forgot the rue?
If you're jonezing for some deep fried anything, this is where you should go. Make sure your table is wiped before you put your arms or clothes on it otherwise you will have somebody's leftover on you."}
{"text":"One of the best treasures in the valley.  Even the fries, or \"chips\" are good.  Everything is made when ordered-no frozen or pre made items.  Only reason 4 stars could use some updating, though that is part of the charm of this place."}
{"text":"This place is a bit rough around the edges, but worth the adventure.  They have really good fried food, especially the shrimp.  The prices are decent and they have a bunch of different sauces.  My suggestion is to mix the Louisiana hot sauce with the ranch.  Employ that for all of your dipping delights.  If you are health-conscious or looking for a nice place to eat, then this might not be the place for you.  If you down for greasy goodness in a low-key setting, then this is where you should dine."}
{"text":"Discovered this place in the last couple of years from word of mouth from long time Phoenix residents, and boy am I glad. Great little hole in the wall joint, the fried fish is exactly what I have been missing for years - crunchy without the breading overwhelming the seafood and not super greasy. Also love the shrimp, hush puppies, and fried zucchini. It's a little ways away from me so I have to make an extra effort to get there, but I'm never disappointed - and they're open till 9 in case I get a late-ish craving."}
{"text":"I agree. It looks like a dive from the outside. But at least it also looks like a dive from the inside too. We shared a fish and shrimp and chips along with fried okra and clam chowder. Everything was 'meh'. No real seasoning to the okra breading. Probably frozen bagged chips and my wife refused to eat more than a few spoons of the soup. She did really like the fish though. That was the slightly redeeming factor."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here for many years (decades).  Was looking for a place simiilar to Skipper's Fish & Chips (NW - Seattle) chain.  Was hoping that I could find the fish similar; it is the breading is very simlar to what I remembered; since I used to work there in the 70's; early 80's...Tried the seafood platter, Clam strips were good, coleslaw was fresh and not overly sweet; fries were fresh and didn't taste fishy; but the fish, the fish is what will bring me back again & again.
REVISED - Okay, this is becoming a staple in my diet.  Have been there probably once a week for the past 5-6 weeks!!!"}
{"text":"Just went last night for my first time, I was excited by the large menu and various options they have.  The place looks fine, very clean and the condiment station is laid out well as others have posted.  The layout of tables is a little \"different\" feels like you on a boat or sub with narrow walkways, guess that adds to the experience.  Ordered the 2 fish (cod)/1 shrimp so that I could try both types of seafood.  The food came out looking great but as Shane S. said the fish looked like it was frozen too long and just kinda fell out of the breading.  It was dripping water as I cut into the piece and the breading was kinda like a shell around it not really infused into the fish filet.  So I was a little disappointed, the shrimp was good and would probably get more shrimp than fish next time.  Yeah, I'll probably go again when I'm craving this type of seafood, I'd give it another shot.  The cocktail sauce does have a nice kick to it as well.  I'd like to try the zucchini and hush puppies next time."}
{"text":"These people where not very nice . I don't normally waist time writing bad reviews on things I don't like. Something should be said .  This place was horrible !!!! Don't waist you're time or money."}
{"text":"Last of a dieing breed, best old style fish and chips with a home made cocktail sause"}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've ever had. The hush puppies are so good. They have pieces of corn in them"}
{"text":"My friend and I read some ok reviews of this place and decided to give it a go. Not crazy about the location but I think for lunch you're fine. I got the fish and shrimp with fries. The service was friendly, the food served quick and hot. The tartar sauce was pretty good and the cocktail sauce was pretty good. The fish itself was a little bland but I think that I will give them a try again but this time I will add a little lemon. I hear good things about the clam chowder so I think I'm gonna order that next time too. Maybe I'll be updating this review."}
{"text":"I really got obsessed with trying this place. So much, my coworker placed an order. But I placed them together. 2 of this, 2 of that. They couldn't split it on our cards :/ that was disappointing. Also I had to pump my own cocktail sauce. Why wouldn't you just have it ready for a to go?  However I have an affinity for fried mushrooms (and artichoke hearts if you should ever dare) and fried zucchini. Sooooo maybe you should cater to your local clientele Who you could get business on the regular from. Maybe you should be able to split tickets. I couldn't  tip not that I wanted to based on management suck decision. Service was great, time quote was great. Staff and food were on point."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here for lunch.  First I should tell you I am not a seafood fan as whole so I wasn't thrilled at the idea. The only thing that is worse than something fishy tasting is something fishy and greasy.  I had the cod and fries and can tell you that neither of these came close to being that.  The cod was was light and fresh as were the fires.  You definitely get plenty to fill you up.  A seafood place I will go back to, WOW.  The only thing I regret was not getting wither the zucchini or mushrooms.  They certainly looked good as I saw them go by me.  An added advantage is Knock Kneed Lobster is very clean and inviting with plenty of parking.  I will go back."}
{"text":"My hubby has been begging me to go here with him for a couple of years now. We finally went last night. Nice hole in the wall spacious fried fish joint. Prices are okay. I went with the Large fried shrimp and chips, side of coleslaw (which is huge) and hubby went with fish and chips and hush puppies. The whole meal cost about $20 including a drink. It was okay.  a little under seasoned if you ask me. Will I be returning?  not quite sure. Maybe try the clam strips next time. Wasn't impressed and might even give it less than 3 stars. I was being a Little generous."}
{"text":"Customer service-3

Recommendation-No

This place is nice and big. The lady taking the order was nice. The food wasn't that great. I ordered the 2piece fish and 3 shrimp. The batter on their fried food is thick and was not seasoned at all. If u drunk and need grease this is the place to be. Other than that it's just a heart attack waiting to happen. Will I go back probably not."}
{"text":"Worst fish and chips I've EVER had.
The fish was tough because it was over fried and the breading was sliding. The chips (french fries) were cold and tough...NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on June 2nd. Just about every table was dirty. Cleaned a table myself. Went into the mens room and wow. I have never been so grossed out. Both  toilets full of crap. The bathroom reeked. I really think it was a bio hazard. I told one of the workers about the mess in the bathroom and she either did not understand english or she did not care. I was so grossed out I could not eat there so I went across the street to Jack in the Box 

I think the place is under new ownership. Did not look like the Sullivan family to me."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place for years. My friend and I kept saying, we should try it. Well, today was finally the day. If you're looking for a nice fancy seafood restaurant... This is not your place. And, you could probably tell this by the outside of the building. I wouldn't eat there when it's nighttime. It just doesn't look like a good neighborhood. The restaurant is clean and has some appropriate sea décor. The young girl who took our order was friendly and welcoming. My friend had one shrimp, one fish and chips. I had one shrimp, two fish and chips. Also, we shared six hush puppies and fried okra. The shrimp was like rubber. I would not order it again. The fish was good, but lacked flavor. I was impressed that it wasn't greasy. I would definitely get the hush puppies and fried okra again. The hush puppies were flavorful. And, the okra wasn't slimy and had a good taste. On the way out, I noticed a customer who had fish tacos. They looked really good. So, I might go back and try a few other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service my favorite soda which is diet mountain dew

This place may not look like much from the outside or the inside, but it is very clean and they serve the seafood. If you want seafood this is the place to go. The location is not the best, but that is far from a hindrance when it come to the quality of the food and the friendly and excellent staff."}
{"text":"Delicious and huge portions. Very packed this Friday night and no tacos on fridays currently. But so many other options."}
{"text":"Until moving to the far Southeast Valley, I used to frequent Knock Kneed Lobster for lunches (I worked at an office down the street) and dinner with my family. I remember clean succulent seafood and veggies, properly seasoned and fried to perfection.  I also remember a clean, casual environment in which to eat it. This was not my experience today, July 7, 2016. The breading was hard and tasteless and reminded me of chewing through a shell to get to the walnut inside. And the place was grimy.  There must have been a change in ownership/management to go along with the new cooks I noticed in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Good food. Lots of choices for dipping sauces at their sauce station. I would say this... if you are a life long Pete's Fish N Chips fan... try not go in and compare to Pete's. This is something completely different than Pete's and stands on it's own. Some days I am in a Pete's mood and some days I am in a Knock Kneed Mood."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been bugging me about trying this restaurant. When we drove into the parking lot, saw it was directly across from Christies cabaret and next to a private one on one house?? I almost fainted.. 

Anyway fried zucchini was AMAZING. It's one of my favorite things to eat, and they did a good job! Same with the fried shrimp. Ordered the fish & chips. I liked it, wasn't blown away. (Then again I am from Seattle.) I would have to say one of the top seafood places in Arizona. 

The reason I give 4 out of 5 is the dive aspect of it.. Seems like they picked any and every decoration their theme and threw it on a wall. Makes it look cheap & cluttered. And the bulletin board... At a restaurant? Weird. I organize for a living, and it made me cringe. 

Definitely will be going back though, but will order take out."}
{"text":"Really good deep fried fish that is breaded on the spot. Tastes fresh. Potato salad is very good."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, what? This place was the worst! First of all, it's a major dive in a thoroughly sketchy area (shares parking lot with really gross strip club and there's another one across the street.) The food is horrible! Horrible! Thick, bland, raw flour tasting breading with not a speck of seasoning to be found. $4.35 for a bowl of bad canned clam chowder. Fries were soggy and bland. Clams were bland as well, I've had frozen that were better. Cocktail sauce was even bland. Seriously, if you like eating at convalescent homes this is your place. Otherwise, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Updated 5/2018

I've been a customer for over 20 years. With the exception of a couple of times, the meals have been really good. Generous portions, fish/breading combo has a good flavor and is crunchy. The fries are fine. The fried zucchini/ranch combo is delicious.

The fish was a bit thin in two of the ample-sized pieces, but one had a nice thick chunk of fish.

 After staying a away for a while due to a clunker meal last year, this is once again the place I'll go out of my way to visit when I get a craving for fish'n'chips."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Friday night with a friend. When I drove up, I was a little worried as the area is very questionable. There was a sketchy-looking fellow just sitting waiting in a big SUV in the parking lot, so right away I was a bit unnerved.
Once inside, I felt a little better. The place was busy which is usually an okay sign.

I ordered the 1 shrimp, 1 fish and chips combo. The shrimp was big and pretty good, the fish was your typical battered fillet without much flavor. I doused it in lemon juice and tartar sauce which helped a little. The fries could have been better. They kind of tasted like Ore-Ida fries from a frozen bag. So really the food part of the experience was just so-so at best, if not a bit bland. 

I do have a bone to pick with the presentation of the restaurant though. What's the story with the handwritten signs covering almost every empty space of the wall? 'Do this, don't do that..' it's like they are so afraid of being sued that they came up with every possible less-than-desirable scenario that could possible take place whilst eating out and made a sign for it. To me it just came across as grumpy management. And then there are the sub-par pixelated photos slapped on the back of the booths. It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, \"that works.\" 
As a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.

DO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity."}
{"text":"When I first arrived i was excited that I found a diamond in the ruff. The exterior building was painted and decorated like an east coast fish restaurant. When i entered it was a bit confusing as to where we went in the maze.  Specials were listed in a hit board and a three fish taco special was running for $8.50 i felt like I needed to try multiply items to find my favorite so i ordered 1 fish taco and a 1 piece fish and jumbo shrimp. Again, my expectations were high for this business that has been in business for over 25 years. My order number was call and with great excitement i went to my table to partake in what i felt was going to be a great meal. I started with my fish taco that was advertised as AZ's best fish taco!? When i bit into the taco i was greatly disappointed that i got a taste of everything other than fish. After all it is a fish taco and it should be the star. I felt robbed, sad and greatly disappointed. Well there is still the shrimp and fish.  I choose the JUMBO shrimp next. Hardly jumbo by the way. I dipped it into the cocktail sauce and took my first bite.  What the heck is wrong with this place.  My bread ding is as thick as my not so jumbo shrimp. I mean it was ok but definitely not worthy. On to the fish. I looked at my fish and it was a good size piece of fish and pretty thick. Nice looking breading and texture. I put some tarter sauce on my fish and took a bite. Finally, i was delighted that my fish was moist, crunchy, flaky and yup, delicious.  I can say i would go back but based on the items i ordered i will stick with the fish.  Chips were not crunchy and just average but I'm not a big chip fan so i usually only eat a few so really i probably not one to give  feedback on them.  I did not post pictures of the food because i was too excited to dive in and EAT! So sorry, i forgot to"}
{"text":"The clam chowder was not too bad but nothing impressive. Their portions of the fried cod were big! The restaurant looked like a run down from the outside but I loved how the interior gave the area a real chill aura"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. The star of the show here is the fish and chips. No shit.. BEST I've had in az. A little pricier than Pete's, but not oversalted, or nearly as tough. The fish is flaky, and believe it or not, wasn't gamey or even 'fishy'. I think they keep it divey to keep out the foodies. Shhh. It's a secret."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with the hubby, after reading the reviews here. The parking lot is very dark and the place is not in a very good area (there's 2 strip clubs across the street- towards the front and to the side). 

The fish was flavorless, the shrimp tasted weird and the breading was ok. The hush puppies were the best! Service was ok, we had to wait about 5 mins, before anyone noticed us. 

Not sure we'll come back any time soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced not suggesting to no one in fact I'm gonna warn everyone not to try waste of money shrimp sucks fish tacos states inside best in phx but truthfully Filibertos knocks them out the water breading sucks everything is blan ugh  if there was a zero star I could give that'll be them"}
{"text":"if you really love Knock Kneed think twice before you continue to read!!!!! 


i went in today for the usual good food. That wasn't the case today... I sat down waiting for our order to be called and what do you know-in the corner of my eye i see something running. A MOUSE!! No thank you i went up to the cashier and asked for my money back and they all acted surprise \"a mouse? really? that's never happened before!\". My last visit there and i will not be back."}
{"text":"Crappy food, servers seem like drug addicts. Crab legs are over priced, precut and frozen. Go elsewhere for seafood."}
{"text":"Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover

Knock Kneed Lobster might not look like much from the outside but as the old adage goes,  \"Don't judge a book by its cover\".  If you are searching for an upscale restaurant with only healthy seafood options, look somewhere else. However, if you want a great \"hole in the wall\" place where you can enjoy good, old time fish & chips, Knock Kneed Lobster is the place for you.

Knock Kneed Lobster has been serving fish and chips for about 50 years, and there's a reason why Knock Kneed Lobster has been in the business for so long, the food at Knock Kneed Lobster is really good.

Knock Kneed Lobster  is a walkup to the window and wait to be called to pick up your order kind of place. Sure, the atmosphere might be nothing to write home about, and Knock kneed lobster couldn't be considered an upscale restaurant, however, no one can deny that Knock Kneed Lobster is serving up delicious fish/shrimp & chips. 

Today, I ordered the 2-piece fish/shrimp and chips, and not only was my fish/shrimp cooked perfectly crisp and light but the serving was large.
.  
In addition, to serving hot, fresh, delicious meals.  Knock Kneed Lobster makes sure you have everything you want to top your meal. The condiment bar has everything you could possoble want or need.  There's  ranch dressing, tater sauce, cocktail sauce, malt vinger, and ketchup, just to name a few.

The staff is always friendly, service is fast, and prices are reasonable. Knock Kneed Lobster has always been a good old stand-by that I always enjoy.

If you're every craving fish and chips, stop by Knock Kneed Lobster you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My lady and I love this place. Better then petes fish and chips! Try the tacos and shrimp and chips! Mm!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips are the way to go! The shrimp are also a good addition, with some awesome cocktail and tartar sauce. Definitely stop by coming back from the airport!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Phoenix!  This little gem is nothing fancy, but the food is fabulous. I highly recommend the lobster and crab.  They also just opened a new patio for this fall. It definitely  satisfies my seafood cravings without hurting my wallet."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 for their food but the sauces offered are horrible. Tartar and cocktail sauce are so easy to make. Don't get me started on the Ranch. The bottle stuff the offer brings down the whole experience because the food is really good!!! I will go again but bring my own sauce."}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in the valley. Always fresh and they have plenty of great sauces for anything you order. Love the shrimp n fish and chips. A tad pricey but the quality makes it worth it. I've been there over 20 times over the years and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  We live in the middle of the desert so it's pretty much a given that you aren't going to find a fish and chips place like you would on a coast.  I've tried a handful of places with the two places around the valley that have decent fish are Pete's and Long John Silvers (yes, I know this is sad).  I have just never found a place that is great.  

I've driven by the place a decent number of times and it looks like an old worn out building.  If I was just going by external appearance, I would never try this place because it looks bad and it doesn't help that it's next to two strip clubs (with the one right next door looking very creepy and questionable as to it's legality).  The rest of the neighborhood isn't great but it really isn't that bad either.

I finally decided to give the place a try because I was craving some fish and chips and thought it might be good to try a new place.  The inside of the restaurant isn't much better than the outside.  It looks like an old worn out place you might find along the ocean in California.  I ordered a 3 piece fish and chips.  It took a while to get the order and the fish/fries came out steaming hot.  It was definitely freshly cooked.  The fish pieces were not evenly cut and tasted very fresh.  Contrary to some of the other reviews, I do not think these are your standard frozen fish sticks.  Pete's fish looks much more like a standard frozen piece due to the uniform shape.  The fries were also very good.

I thought the meal was very delicious.  My favorite part about this place is the sauces.  They have all the necessary sauces available and you can get as much or as little as you need.  It was refreshing to get everything and not have to beg the person behind the counter for a larger quantity of anything.  The tartar sauce tasted good and is my favorite of all the valley fish places I've tried.

I've been back to this place twice since my first visit and have brought my co-workers.  They all shared similar feedback and enjoyed their meals.  On the return visits I added a piece of shrimp which was huge and delicious.  I tried the cocktail sauce with it and found that I really enjoyed their sauce.  I usually don't like cocktail sauce so it was a pleasant surprise.  

This is definitely my favorite fish place in the valley and my co-workers and I have decided this will be a regular stop on our lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Ambiance: An older family-style seafood restaurant, with lots of character. Some might call it worn-down but I think it's brimming with old school character. Patrons are 20-60 years olds from primarily the blue collar crowd. 

Food: Obviously a 'fish and chips' place so most of everything is offered deep fried, including the vegetables. The deep fried cod, with deep fried okra and hush puppies were excellent. They also offer a few non fried choice like grill and baked fish fillets.

Service: You order in the front and then when your number is called you pick up. Pretty hard to mess that up but I would say everyone had a smile on and was helpful.

Overall: A great history'd restaurant that has been around forever and offers the unique ' fish and chips' experience."}
{"text":"When a business has been around as long as this one, I have to try it to see what the appeal is. My wife and I ate here for the first time and it will be the last.

There are a LOT of rules. I counted at least 4 signs that said you must have your ticket to pick up your food. Hey guys. if you need to put up numerous signs, maybe its your rules that are the problem - not the customers.

I ordered fish and shrimp with chips. The shrimp looks like long, skinny chicken fingers and the fish looked like a square chicken patty. Far too thin, in my opinion. Cod is a very, very large fish, so to get skinny (thin) pieces, you might as well order talapia. 

The 'chips' were just ordinary frozen french fries. 

No tartar sauce was included or offered. The self-serve dispenser had a sign to ask for it and when we asked for it, it took over 5 minutes to get it as our food was growing colder.

There is an exposed surge protector that the soda machines (Pepsi) are plugged into. I'd hate to think what happens if someone spills their drink near it.

The place just seemed very old and the staff acted like they are doing you a favor and won't offer any assistance on their own. They wait until you ask. If you don't ask, you don't get.

At almost $50 for dinner, it is not cheap and the food was very bland. The tartar sauce that they guarded so heavily, was disgusting. 

Glad we tried it. Now we know."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  What happened to this gold mine?  We ordered Onion Rings and Hush puppies.  Received 5 each.  The plates and portions shrunk whoever the prices 
Increased. Rocky Point Shrimp Cocktail 
Is half the size it used to be. 
Time to find a new place."}
{"text":"I know what you're think, why would you order a burger and hush puppies at a seafood restaurant. I am not a huge seafood fan, but my group of coworkers wanted to go. I will say for a seafood place the burger was large and cooked well. The hush puppies were fine. The service was good and fast, and the decor was quaint. My coworkers loved the shrimp and chips they had and the fish and chips. Large portions and relatively inexpensive. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"So so so good. We went twice in one weekend and will def be back. Everything was perfectly cooked and so tasty. Def one the best seafood restaurants I have been too."}
{"text":"Where does my old man want to go for Father's Day? At of all the joints in town, he sticks with the place he has enjoyed the longest....Knock Kneed Lobster. We called ahead given our group size and were accommodated with a separate room (see pic :)) . Very appreciated. Upon arrival, we all headed to register to place our orders. Brooks, the manager, was so helpful and did not hesitate to answer all our questions and provided great customer service. Our food was ready in an adequate amount of time and was hot out the oven. According to all, the food was good and all left satisfied. I ordered their fish tacos and had the chance to also try their fried shrimp, fried oyster, fried cod, chicken strips and their hush puppies. Super healthy I know. All were good, but the tacos and hush puppies stood out as my favorites. All in all, great service, good food, and a satisfied father on his special day."}
{"text":"I WAS SO HOPEFUL! I saw this location as I was heading to my hotel. Looked like a moms and pop type of place so I opted to try it out. Ordered the Aztec Seafood Salad that was being advertised. The cashier was extremely nice and helpful. Waited about 10mins and received my food. 

Bland is an understatement. I doctored it up w/ their cocktail sauce and ranch but yeah... bummers. I rated it 3 stars because I did finish it and it was okay after my touch.

Maybe my expectations were just too high. It was $9 and I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"I used to go here when I worked in Phoenix years ago. We drove by it yesterday and I noticed it, so my wife and I turned around. I had fish and chips and Cole slaw since that's what I always ate there back In the day. It was as good as I remembered it. My wife had fish tacos, Cole slaw and onion rings. She's not a fried food lover, but she enjoyed it too. All in all the only thing I regret about stopping is that it's about 30 miles from where we live, so repeats will be few and far between."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but we're still looking for that GREAT fish and chips place in the Valley. I'd say this one is slightly better than average. The breading stayed ON the fish, which is a plus and the fish itself was nice and flaky without being too oily. The breading was a bit bland though, even after being doused in lemon juice and malt vinegar. 
I tend to think $6 is a bit steep for one piece of fish and fries, but since I only had one piece of fish they seemed to just fill the rest of my plate with french fries. The fries weren't anything special, but they were good with malt vinegar and ranch dressing.
Definitely a dive in a divey neighborhood, but overall a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I have had Knock Kneed Lobster for almost 50 years. I love how fresh and \"ungreasy\" the fish is. The batter is very light and not loaded with salt. Many people commented that it was bland or flavorless--works for me! Much better to taste the fish! Lots of wonderful memories of my dad picking up Fish and Chips on Friday--especially during Lent. My dad turns 97 on Saturday and I am picking up lunch tomorrow (Good Friday) and sharing it with my dad! The shrimp and sides are great too. It is a dive and we love it!"}
{"text":"Good ol' fish & chips. Food was good, not greasy at all. But they are heavy on the salt (and I'm not the type thats sensitive to salt).

All of the printed papers hanging every where with their rules & such is a little over whelming."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch this was my first time. I just ordered the shrimp and it was pretty good. Wouldn't mind coming back to try something else."}
{"text":"I am a huge seafood fan. I grew up going to places similar to this. Nothing fancy. The difference to me is the prices here are high for what you get and the Shrimp was awful. Their breading is unusually thick (about half the shrimp piece was breading). I did like the fish and the service was good. I also was expecting hushpuppies and grits for the price. Will I go back. Maybe, but I will only order the fish. It's too bad, because Phoenix could use a GOOD cheap Seafood place."}
{"text":"Came here for some fish and chips on a Friday. They do have a pretty good parking lot in the back. The ordering can be a little bit crazy since they rush you through it. But I just got the regular to fish and fries. I have to say the food is very good. But looking for a clean table that's a different story."}
{"text":"My fiance took me here the other day to introduce me to one of his fun childhood memories when picking family up at the airport. They would always stop in here to eat fish and chips. I walked in and thought the atmosphere was really cute and appropriate for the theme. We ordered up fish and chips and and waited just a few minutes. We went and got all our sauces and lemons then dug into some amazing fried fish! Great temperature, breading, seasoning you even got the French fries right. Way to go. I will definitely be back!  I thought the price was a little on the high side but it was delicious so...forgivable."}
{"text":"I love the zucchini here. It's so so good! I should probably just order the zucchini in the future, though, because I always end up with too much food. I end up packing mine up and giving it to a homeless person. Everything is really good, it's just too big of portions for fried food. If you eat a whole entree you will feel awful."}
{"text":"Very tasty place to eat.  They have really good tartar and cocktail sauce.  Im good with a 1 piece fish and 2 piece shrimp & chips meal which doesnt cost much at all.  Then when you're all done, head across the street to the topless bar ;)"}
{"text":"This place has the best fish tacos!!!! We love coming here. There regular fish is just as good."}
{"text":"Jumbo shrimp are always my go to. The now have fish taco's. Unfortunantly, you can't order just ONE fish taco to try it out. You have to order the freaking combo! That is pretty dumb IMO, what if I don't like it? What if I start to resent the place because I by passed my always delicious jumbo shrimp? So, I skipped the fish taco and ordered my usual.

I like to get the ranch and louisana hot sauce and mix them together. Dipping heaven. They offer coctail sauce and tarter sauce as well. There is so many choices on what plate you can get, fish and jumbo shrimp combinations. Or just fish or just jumbo shrimp. The fried zuchinni is also good.

For the smallest combo it's about 8 bucks, drink is seperate. So it's not to bad in the price."}
{"text":"this place has been here for years and though I've lived in Phoenix all of my life I just started eating here about a year ago. I was kind of leery about trying it out. It's not in the best neighborhood and I figured the seafood couldn't be all that good considering this is the desert. 

Knock Kneed is a hole in the wall, but it's a great little hole in the wall. I usually get the shrimp platter with a side of fried okra and hush puppies. 
If you like hush puppies this place has the best! I often just want to go there simply for the hush puppies. 

I got my coworkers hooked on this place and we usually get lunch from KKL once a week and we don't work close to this place either. It's usually a 30 minute trip there and back, but worth it."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to try a seafood place in a land locked state. When I see disk and chips I have a certain type of breading in mind, flaky wasn't it. It smells funny when you walk in... And yesXi know it's a fish place. When I travel I always like to hit a good local joint and that almost always includes a seafood place, normally I'm near the ocean, though. They never smell fishy, though. 

And their jumbo shrimp? Pretty sure it was just extruded normal shrimp. Lots of breading (which wasn't bad) with a thin strip of what I assume was shrimp. 

Not impressed."}
{"text":"The two-piece fish and chips is what I ordered.  The proportions were sizable and the taste was very good.  They have malt vinegar if you prefer this on your dish.  I will definitely come back again.  This is the best fish and chips that I have tasted in Phoenix."}
{"text":"When traveling for business I rarely eat at the same place twice. I like to sample the local cuisine. Landed late Monday and this place came up nearby as a decent seafood restaurant so I thought why not. The sign says they have the best fish tacos in Phoenix and I have to agree. Food is prepared when you order so don't be in a rush but I believe it's well worth it. Fish is nice and hot, not over fried. Cod comes in nice sizes and it is filling. Tortillas are warm and the toppings fresh. I get the 3 taco plate. If your a fan of mango salsa splurge for a second helping for $0.25. Was good enough that I made a second visit on my way back to the airport....  Same order LOL."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Been here for years when they had Mesa location as well as Sullivan's pier too. It's too bad that closed. Well the fish is amazing. Just as you would find in the northwest. The hush puppies and zucchini are simply the best. You gotta try this place. Don't let the location scare you. It's next to Christies and Juicy Lucy's but completely worth it. Only thing I wish they had was homemade tartar sauce. The affiliated Sullivan's pier that used to be offered it for $.25 per one and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  No junky cheap fish here.  And you lots of real fish, not just a bunch of batter and a tiny bit of fish. They have a huge selection on their menu.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! A great deal and delicious food. The fish tacos are packed with ingredients and flavor, and the salsa is delicious. The plates are awesome as well, and the condiments are spot on (especially the cocktail sauce). Cooked to order too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Phoenix.  The shrimp is unbelievable. Don't need to get a lot because they are huge."}
{"text":"Fried okra usually catches my attention, but all of their fried food is good as well, save for the fries (they're a little sub par, but still edible).  You get a lot of food for a decent price.

The place is across the street and right next to two strip joints, and it's a little sketchy coming here at night, but I've never had problems.  It's even right along the light rail, which is really convenient for times I decide not to drive.

They make their own cocktail sauce, which has more of a spicy kick than I'm used to, but it's tangy and Much better than Pete Sauce, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were excellent! Light and crunchy, fresh cilantro, just a hint of spice (mango ghost pepper salsa on the side is amazing)
I want to take this place back to Nashville with me to show those salt and beans places what real tacos can be."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave reviews, just in special cases.  But I really had to because of Jonathan M. and his overboard, exaggerated, bogus review.
I was at the Knock Kneed 2 weeks ago with a buddy on his way to Sky Harbor.  The food was well made and delicious, especially the fried shrimp.  It was probably the best fish and chips I've ever had. The restaurant is old with a lot of character and patronized by families.  This Jonathan fella must have gotten fired from the place or works across the street, the man is a straight up troll and a liar.  This is why I hate Yelp, guys like this get away with murdering a business without regard or consequence."}
{"text":"Mmm fried goodness. Expertly fried seafood and starches are the keys to happiness at Knock Kneed Lobster. We came here for dinner due to its close proximity to Celebrity Theater.

The menu is simple. You have your choice of various seafood, and an option for chicken for those that aren't seafood-inclined, with various fried sides such as fried zucchini, mushrooms, and fries. I opted to share a 3 piece fish and chips, and tried some fried okra and fried zucchini. The fish and chips had a perfectly crispy crust, with flaky tender fish. The fried okra and zucchini were delicious. The okra was not slimy at all, and the zucchini had a lovely tenderness to contrast with the crisp breading.

After ordering at the counter, you have a plethora of condiments to choose from, such as tartar sauce, vinegar, ketchup, and ranch. The soda fountain is self serve, and they offer good sugar free options such as diet Mountain Dew.

The neighborhood is questionable at best, but if you are in the area or if you want to catch a quick bite before a show at Celebrity Theater this is a good option."}
{"text":"We are waiting for my mom coming in on a flight and didn't want to sit in the cell phone lot baking in the son. This place is ten minutes away and air conditioned, much better place to sit and have a drink. We had a domestic beer and sweet tea and ordered the taco and ceviche it was awesome!"}
{"text":"It was busy, but I personally didn't like the thick corn breading.  There was very lirtle fish and a lot if bread on it.  Taste was ok.  Nit sure will go back"}
{"text":"I wanted to bring a friend here, but he took a look at the menu.  All it said was 8 fish, 8 chicken, 12 shrimp, nothing about lunch specials, so he wanted to go somewhere else.   Too bad I could not convince him how good the food is.  I bet this happens to a lot of people."}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix, I went to Knock Kneed all the time. I left in 1988 and have been chasing the crispy fish and the cocktail sauce ever since. Nothing has come close. Through FB, I am glad to hear you are still there. You are for sure a stop when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Foods pretty tasty and it's a great value. Quite a bit of food and dirt cheap."}
{"text":"I have only had the fish and chips here. It has been very very good every time I have been here, at least 10x.  I just wish it was closer to my house so I could go there more often. If you work or are in the area definitely go here. Its not fancy nor is it cheap, but it is definitely worth it when you want some fish and chips."}
{"text":"I love eating here.  We drive all the way from North Mesa to get our fish fix.  Its all about the crunch.  The fish is always made to order and always succulent.  I always order more than enough so I can have a fish sandwich for lunch the next day.  Hubby gets the shrimp combo so I always get a piece of shrimp too.  This place is worth the drive.  I would drive up from Tucson if I had to.  It's that good.  So if it's fish and chips your craving, then head over to this home town favorite.  I've been eating here since the Lazy Lou's days.  That's decades!!  No lie."}
{"text":"Ok, so YES, it's greasy, the place is a little sketchy, but OH MY, I love, love, love this place!!  I could eat their fish and veggies daily!! YUM! Can't wait to go back :)))"}
{"text":"Very cool old place in the industrial part of town.  I wish it wasn't surrounded by two strip clubs (made for interesting conversation with young kids) but the food was pretty good, not greasy at all."}
{"text":"Fully acknowledging and accepting I live in Arizona... the fish and fries stand up to any greasy spoon fish and chips place my travels have taken me. The fish and fries are always hot fresh flaky and delicious. The shrimp are larger shrimp split in half and come out a hot delight. The tartar sauce adds to the flavors and the cocktail sauce is a good accompany to the shrimp.. truthfully fish and shrimp stand on their own. 
Even the fries are perfectly hot salted and tasty. Try the fried mushrooms the zucchini is good I just prefer the mushrooms. This isn't a fancy schmancy place nor is it in a great neighborhood... just suck it up and give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.

Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. 

I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  

The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the \"hood\" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  

---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!"}
{"text":"Always a good sign when the parking lot is full and it did not disappoint!  Great fish and chips for lunch!  Friendly service and having to wait just a bit for piping hot food was worth it.  Portions were generous.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I went to the Knock Kneed Lobster for the first time yesterday and I have to say I was very impressed. If I wasn't with someone who knew the place I probably wouldn't have stopped here let alone been in this neighborhood.
I had the 2 fish/1shrimp and chips, The fish was flaky and good as was the shrimp. I also tried the fried Zucchini and the fried okra, both were crispy and not greasy at all. I am a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"Sometimes you try a new place which your first time turns out as your last time. Everything is fried and expensive. Even if half the price I wouldn't eat there again. Not even free. The food was bland. I was expecting so much more. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is one of the best fish and chips meals I've had in Phoenix. I highly recommend getting an order of the fried zucchini it could be the best I've ever had. Good portions. Priced right. More filling than you think. I Love it."}
{"text":"This fish fry place is delicious! They have Alaskan cod freshly battered and fried once ordered. the staff was nice, the food came fast, and hot! I'm a native and we brag about Pete's fish and chips all the time around here, but knock kneed lobster outshines them in my eyes. I ate Pete's religiously for my whole life, now I will come here for their fried fish."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Shrimp has a bit to much breading I guess thats what makes it jumbo! Fish is light and flaky fresh tasting. Love the hush puppys..great seasonings. Clams were crispy and yummy. Service was ok. A little unattentive and distracted."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is fulfilling. The fish is by far the best and always taste fresh. I wish there was more than one location but the drive is worth it. The only thing is the prices are a little high. To feed a family can become pricey. I have came with family of 5 and spent 80-90.00 dollars. Overall this is one of the best fish n chip spots."}
{"text":"A no frills joint I have been patronizing forever. Almost forty years. Ouch!! Sounds odd to say/write it. I love this place. Seriously, only once did I have a \"bad\" order. It's always been great and my Zucchs or Shrooms (I always substitute the fries) are always large/plump.

In all the years I've been eating at KKL it has never been greasy, save the fact it is deep fried. You know the kind, after you're done eating there is a pool of oil left behind. The batter has never changed, perfectly dry, so for me great. I get what expect. Tasty food, a little high in price but come on; we're not coastal...."}
{"text":"Big portions, I got the 2 piece fish n chips with a side a zucchini and a drink, was about $15, I couldn't finish all of it. I didn't really like any of the sauces, they were ok. The best sauce for the fish was the Louisiana hot sauce. Ranch dressing was good with the zucchini and ketchup for the fries. The fries were the best part of the meal. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and I did. The food was good, it just needed some Pete's sauce to go with it. Grade C+"}
{"text":"You dont go here for the decor you go for the made to order fish and Chips they are fantastic and I am very particular about my fish n chips! There is Tartare sauce for you fish, Malt Vinegar for your Chips."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for some good ol' fish and shrimp and chips. I try to not over do it but, how can I not with all the awesome food on the menu? It always comes down to 2pc shrimp and chips, clam chowder, and fried zucchini. Some places love to charge for extra sauces. Not at Knock Kneed's, get as much ketchup, ranch, tarter, cocktail, and as much hot sauce as you please."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying I disagree with other peoples Yelp reviews in regards to the \"catfish being really good\". It was absolutely ghastly! I can tell the Catfish was not fresh because it looked dull, it wasn't moist, it wasn't flaky, and when I chewed it instantly turned into mush in my mouth. I'm pretty sure this fish was either expired or frozen. I'm very disappointed in this restaurant for serving me trash for 16.95. It wasn't worth it! Save your money and go somewhere else!!

The only thing I liked about the catfish was how crunchy the breading was but yet that was also bland. I also ordered the hush puppies which were the only thing good on my plate. The fries were dried out like they been sitting under a lamp all day. 

By far this is the worst place I tried catfish and Hopefully I don't get sick. I won't be returning back to this place and wish this business the best of luck. 

You guys want delicious catfish go to WTF and order MARYLN'S fish and chips. You wont be disappointed.


Well 5 hours later... No exaggeration this food made me sick and my stomach didn't agree with that nasty fish. I might have food poisoning. You've been warned. Thank god I only ate one piece of fish out of the three."}
{"text":"Got a craving for fish and chips? Best place in town I think. Great Fish and Shrimp."}
{"text":"Knock Kneed Lobster is a classic standby that offers damn decent fried fish n chips. It beats Pete's and Pirates by a mile (but god do I hate Pete's) and the fish is freshly breaded in the back, fried to order: not frozen hunks of prefab awful.

The breading is very crisp and the fish flakes apart and is quite tasty with a generous dose of salt and lemon. The fries are basic, run of the mill fries, but they do the job.

I used to love Sullivan's Pier in Mesa, which was the family's Mesa location, because they had this legendary coconut shrimp and tropical sauce. Sadly, both are missing at KKL, though their other offerings are good.

You're definitely at a dive; that's part of its charm, I suppose, but it is what it is. It's also just a buck or two more than you might expect to pay for a fish n chips lunch, but it tastes fresh and good and I'm alright with that."}
{"text":"They say when you walk into fish place, if it smells like fish, that's a bad sign.  At Knock Kneed Lobster, when you walk in, you smell NOTHING, a very good sign indeed.  That's why they got a 3 instead of a 2.

Now, I know these reviews are supposed to be about the food, and that's a good thing, because the best thing I can say about the ambiance of this place is 1993 Thrift Store Rococo.  They say some of the best places are dives, and that's certainly true.  Just look at Mrs. White's.  This place is a dive, and it's merely okay. 

So let's talk about the food.  I ordered batter fried zucchini, and a 2-fish and 2-jumbo shrimp platter, which came with fries.  Everything that was batter fried (zucchini, fish, and shrimp) tasted exactly the same, and bland.  It was not bad, it was merely tedious.  And it needed salt.  Points in their favor, it was definitely NOT greasy.  I think next time I'd order something that's not batter fried. 

Between the Rococo decor and the food, it was a little surprising to be charged $12-$14 for the fish/shrimp dish, $4 for the zucchini and $2 for a medium drink (free refills) and to be served on disposable Coronet paper plates (the ones you can, if you're old enough to remember, pour an entire can of baked beans on and it won't spill).  Don't get me wrong; I totally understand the convenience of disposable plates, I eat off them at home, as often as not.  But when I'm spending more than $10 at your restaurant, a proper plate would be nice.

Will I go back?  Yes.  Often?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"This place is off the chain.  The white fish sucks but the catfish and shrimp taste like Jesus himself broke off the pieces and deep fried them."}
{"text":"This is possibly the weirdest place in Phx.  It is in a strange location, in a strange building that seems to have a drivethu menu but no window, and um...no lobster on the menu.  I ordered the shrimp with a side of hush puppies.  The shrimp had been sliced in half to the tail so that they could be fried as long sticks.  This was a little odd for me and left me with quite a few bites that were more breading than shrimp.  The hush puppies were pretty good though.  I don't think I'll be going back here but I'm glad I tried it.  It was quite an experience."}
{"text":"we try to come here whenever we are in the area as hubby use to work by here and use to come once a month or so.
the fish is awesome and so is the french fries!!
i did need to reorder a piece of fish as some meat in it but they took good care of us!!
there were 3 of us and the bill was $30-little pricy but we cant find a fish fry that tastes as good as this.
atmosphere is older but the food is good!!
try it you just might like it!! :)
sandy :)"}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day on the way home from work.  So after reading good reviews I decided to try it.  After a dinner of fried everything I think I will need a cardiac exam.  I had fried fish and shrimp and fries.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp.  My dad had fried okra and fried zucchini.  We all shared.  The zucchini was good, I like their batter, but I would have preferred thicker slices of zucchini.  I'm not afraid of having an actual vegatable.  The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry, I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle, but this one isn't it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldn't taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.  We did get a side of coleslaw that was as good as any I've had from the Safeway deli."}
{"text":"Total Dive. If I had just stumbled upon it randomly, I would've just walked right back out, but my friend raved about it. Fish and Chips are great. Shrimp cocktail is amazing. My husband really likes the hush puppies but I'm not a fan. Prices are a little high but its seafood, to be expected. I like the cheesy decor and shady location.. Makes it more of a word of mouth joint."}
{"text":"As far as basic fried fish and chips goes knock need has it down. Yes, it's a total dive hole in the wall and if you don't like the ambience get it to go.  Better than other local city chains.  They batter their own fish and if someone asked me where to go for good fried fish in the Phoenix area it would be Knock Kneed. Where they get the lobster part in their name I have no idea."}
{"text":"Um yessssss please!! Can I have one of everything please. I really love this place! The fish and shrimp delicious. The zucchini is the bomb!! The hush puppies are perfect. Everything is fresh. Live that it's not pretentious at all. This place makes my belly happy!!"}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, huge pieces of fish every time I go.  Love their fried zucchini.  Tons of sauces available, from malt vinegar to Louisiana hot sauce.  Service is pretty quick even when busy.  You'll wait a little bit but that's because they fry your fish fresh just for you, it doesn't sit around.  I usually go for lunch but one time stopped for dinner on the way home from work with the hubz, and he enjoyed a cold Dos Equis with his fish.  This place is a gem in an otherwise not great part of town."}
{"text":"Just ok overall.  The hush puppies were OUTSTANDING.  Best I've ever had.  The fish, fries and zucchini lacked seasoning and were a bland - although I used some hot sauce to fix it."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to give this place a try for some time now, and today was able to actually leave the office and have lunch outside of the office. This is new for me, as the past 2.5 years I was stuck eating in the office.

Once you walk in, you place your order with one of two employees and wait for your number to be called. I ordered the 2 piece fish and chips and  was number 510. There was a bit of a wait, which is fine because the fish is fried fresh and served hades hot. The fries were standard, but the fish was fantastic. I found the batter to be light and crispy; the fish was flaky and moist. A cornucopia of dipping sauces awaits at KKL, but I stuck with the Lousianna Hot Sauce and malt vinegar. There's also ketchup, cocktail sauce, ranch and a few others.

We were fortunate to get there shortly after 11 a.m. before the crowd came in waves.

The nautical theme is kitchy and inviting in a way that reminded me of something that might fit into Sponge Bob's world. I'm looking forward to many future returns."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but the food was good and decent portions.  This was our first time there and the Lady that took our order was friendly and informative.  we will not go out of our way, but we will return here"}
{"text":"I always used to laugh at this place as we rode by on the LR, and I still laughed at it when we drove there in the car.  Inside the building is a fun mish mash of tacky accessories and nautical theming.  I kind of loved it.  

This is a really no nonsense type place with a pretty solid menu in terms of offerings.  Strangely enough, I saw no lobster on the menu until we left.  At that point I discovered a sign that advertised a new menu item, lobster!  Too bad I missed it.  Instead, I went with the shrimp platter which came with 4 jumbo shrimp that were cut in half and then fried in one long strip, and 2 sides.  I picked the hush puppies and fried mushrooms.  The mushrooms were pretty good, but could've used some more salt.  The hush puppies were absolutely killer!  I could eat a ton of those!  The shrimp I didn't really like at all.  Something happened to them during the cooking process that turned them all rubbery like clams.  I wasn't sure I was eating shrimp.  

In any event, I really liked my side dishes and would like to give their clam chowder a try... and eat some more hush puppies.  Maybe if I am lucky I can come back on a cold day and get some chowdah!"}
{"text":"i have lived in AZ for 23 years and often pass the Mesa store but have never stopped. I decided to try it and i got the fried mushrooms that were underdone. Not a fan of those. But the clams were good and i wish i had ordered the larger order."}
