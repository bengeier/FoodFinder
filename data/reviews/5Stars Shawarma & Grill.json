{"text":"Best Middle Eastren food so far  ..  Great food and Friendly faces.

On our first visit we have tried their Beef Shawarma and their Falafel Wrap, and so far i can personally say that this is the best Shawarma and Falafel place atleast in Mississauga.

Price wise they are cheaper than other places, bigger food portions .. and even though they took some time to prepare the food since its fresh, but the result was defenitly worth the wait.

I dont think i can say more about this great place, try it and you wont regret it"}
{"text":"8 pm on a Thursday:
Soft Arabic music from the ceiling set the tone. Everything from the kitchen to were you dine was clean and mise en place. No other customer was in sight so I was greeted right away. 

According to the cashier their popular menu item is of course the chicken shawarma and second was the kofta. Kofta is ground beef or lamb mixed with a medley of spices then grilled to create a delicious middle Eastern meatball. So I ordered a chicken shawarma and a kofta in a wrap, both mild. I was warned the kofta takes 10 minutes to make but I didn't mind. 

The wait took less than 10 minutes. 

The chicken shawarma was by far the most delicious. As for the kofta, I wasn't impressed. Not sure if it's suppose to be like this but it tasted charred. And although I asked for mild, this wrap was WAY too spicy compared to the chicken shawarma which completely over powered what was left of the kofta.  

TL;DR: 
Positive environment/customer service. 
Great chicken shawarma to come back for.
Unimpressive kofta wrap."}
{"text":"Shawarma plate with humus, garlic sauce, hot sauce, potatoes, salad and shawarma was awesome. Great price and filling."}
{"text":"I live nearby so I get a shawarma wrap occasionally and I have to say it absolutely fantastic...to an extent. On the probably 10 times I've ordered here I've probably had my shawarma chicken burnt 2ce. Not just a little bit but all the chicken on the shawarma was burnt and went right in the trash. However the other times where I didn't get burned chicken it was spot on. Tasty chicken, the garlic sauce they have is delicious."}
{"text":"Ever since their name changed to five star, their shawarma wraps became inconsistent & not as good."}
{"text":"Picked up a Chicken wrap to go.   When I opened it was dripping. Overall the food tasted good, but way too messy."}
{"text":"Shouldn't be called 5 star.. food is at best 3 star. They should do something about the sauces they use too. This is a place you go to if nothing else is open or you just want some Arabic type food."}
{"text":"I have ordered medium chicken shawarma which is quite a meal for individual. I definitely would like to vist here again but for betterment i am in search of proper donner or gyros place. Their service is quite good."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall restaurant, so far for what I've tried is really good. And excellent service."}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma was  good. 
For only $ 6.00 nice size .
Not very seasoned . The shawarma was not toasted so it was a bit soft .
Place was clean and they kept changing gloves. 
I would go back ."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma wrap (regular size) with everything except pickles. Good wrap, flavourful chicken. Will try chicken on the rocks next time. Friendly staff.

Food 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review as the owners and name has changed since my last review. 

Its is still a mom & pop shop, seem like they were husband and wife. 

The food is Halal, as I confirmed with the cashier. There is plenty of space to sit down and eat. As its part of the a strip mall there is plenty of parking as well. 

I purchased their chicken Shawarama plate the meat is cooked properly and the potatoes were nice, the portion size was good.  

All in All its not bad. If you are in the neighborhood and feel like Shawarma, this place is there to go and enjoy some."}
{"text":"Came back without the friend who failed to complete the mission last time to try out the lunch special. Some things in life you have to do yourself. Good news though, I thoroughly enjoyed the lunch special. It's the same tasty chicken shawarma with good portion size and most importantly a good price. For $5.99 you get as much as or even more than the regular chicken shawarma plate which costs $10-ish. The special only goes until 3pm, but its worth waiting for. I'll definitely be coming back and it looks like I've just found myself a new go-to place for shawarma."}
{"text":"Went in with a friend and had the $5.99 lunch special. She asked if we wanted potatoes we said sure. She failed to inform us there was a charge till we asked her. Also they are using really cheap bottled water and charging close to $2.00 for it. Food quality was okay, potatoes were overcooked and salad felt old. Chicken was probably the only part that was decent. I would probably not return."}
{"text":"I always come here to get a delicious and fresh shawarma when ever i'm at mavis mall. I cannot resist!!

Besides shawarma's, they have other delicious middle eastern food, quality and fresh!

It usually gets really busy around lunch time!


**BETTER THAN OSMOWS!!!!!!**"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional staff and food it's not fresh.
Unfortunately I am not recommending to visit this place."}
{"text":"Quick review...

This place is just down the road and a great place to go when you want to fill up with a reasonable price. Usually works out to about ~$10. I usually just get the chicken shawarma plate. Chicken, rice, potatoes and a salad. But...! The salad is my favourite thing only because they have these deep-fried-pita-crouton-crunch things on it that are so damn great!
 
Other than that, it's a standard setup place to sit and enjoy a quick meal!

5 stars for 5 Stars, if only just for those crunchy morsels..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for alot of grease in your food.. and i mean dripping grease.. burnt chicken pieces in your chicken shawarma wrap and you are looking to pay 35 dollars.. then this is the place for you!

I ordered chicken shawarma wrap, garlic potatoes and a mixed meat platter(that had alot of grease too.. the rice is really oily and greasyyyy). We have had better shawarma wraps and mixed meat platter at decent prices and the food tastes good.

I do NOT recommend this food place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! If you are looking for a quality shawarma, this is your place. It's a small family owned business. Nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be when the food is that great."}
{"text":"I came by on a Sunday afternoon with a craving for a vegan/vegetarian meal.  I debated between the koushary plate and the falafel plate and I really wanted the falafel plate, but decided on the koushary as it was something different (plus it was cheaper lol).  It was $5.99 for a generous portion of rice mixed with lentils, macaroni with tomato sauce and topped off with hot sauce.  

I wouldn't say this item was great, but it was good, healthy and hearty and a reasonable price (for Mississauga).  

In terms of service, the staff were very friendly and accommodating (they made chit chat with every customer which is great to see).  

There are a few tables but very well spread out so you can sit and eat in peace and quiet.

Verdict; Decent place for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time here. First came here when they first opened.... It was alright. Decided to give them another try for dinner. Ordered the chicken shawarma plate (like I usually do) includes rice, salad, and potatoes. $11.99 + taxes. They charged me $14.99 + taxes. I asked why. She said that's only the chicken... No rice, no salad, no potatoes. They charge extra for that. Keep in mind, she isn't new to the job. I dealt with her the first time I came (year ago or so). I confronted her pointing out the menu screen above her head stating \"Includes rice, potatoes and salad\". She didn't know what to say so she replied \"Do you still want or no?\" (I was calm the entire time, just really confused). Ended up paying the proper price. DOG FOOD.... rice was stale and overcooked. Salad was browning, chicken was over cooked (dry). I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My dad really sold me on this because he had at least double the amount of meat I got.  Not  impressed at all.  Very unimpressed.

I went here because my dad said to go here for a good deal for a chicken schwarma plate.  In fact, it did seem like a good deal for $5.50 (which is now $5.99) because his plate was full of chicken schwarma.  My plate was full of rice and topped with chicken schwarma.  Not enough.  Is this some kind of sexist thing? I always find I always get less meat than the males in general... as if I'm on a diet, well I'm not.  

Not impressed. Not consistent with the servings.  

But then again, maybe it depends on the server, so maybe I'll give it another shot and see if it happens again.  I've actually tried this place a couple of times when my dad had leftovers to share, so if it so happens that I get less meat again, I'm not gonna be impressed for sure!!

As for the taste, it's very salty.  I guess that's why there's all that rice on my plate.  But still!! I expect the same portion as I've witnessed from my dad's plates."}
{"text":"I asked for a chicken shawarma plate AND NOTHING ELSE ($11.99) they charged me $14.11 and when I ask the employee why she charged me that much when $11.99 plus HST is $13.54. The employee tried really hard to convince me that it's just the tax . I asked for a receipt and she gave me the credit card receipt that doesn't show the itemized list, after asking a few times she finally gave me the receipt and it showed they charged me 50 cent extra for tabbouleh that I never asked for she said it's part of the plate.... I asked for a chicken plate and nothing else. The 60 cent doesn't matter it's the principle that they are stealing from customers.  The food is as best average."}
{"text":"Uber order, first time order from this restaurant. Chicken shawarma plate, chicken shawarma sandwich and tabouli salad.

Worst shawarma place ever, basic toppings only garlic paste and sauce on both plates...there wasn't hummus, tahini, etc. I asked for hot sauce on the side and didn't get that. Hot sauce (from my fridge) gave the food flavour other than that worth throwing out, other that that both chickens had no flavour , pickles and onion, wasn't turnips or parsley in the sand which. 

Tabouli made poorly, only oil with no buckwheat or lemon dressing. None of the orders had flavour, never order from here"}
{"text":"Now 5Star Shawarma is my favorite Shawarma place in Mississauga."}
{"text":"The last time I visited this place it was a different restaurant by the name of Pyramids. The place looked pretty much the same. 

They had a special for a fattas chicken shawarma bowl for $7. I love fattas so it was a natural choice. The dish is akin to Osmow's chicken on the rocks in that it is chicken shawarma on rice, covered in white sauce and an optional hot sauce. The difference with 5Stars' take on it is that theirs has pieces of fried flatbread to give the dish texture. My main gripe with chicken on the rocks is that eventually it just becomes a mushy mess. Here, there was a crunch in every bite. 

The bowl was quite a lot of food for $7 - definitely a good amount of meat for the price. Wait times were pretty short as well. This place may become one of my go-to shawarma joints. I'll have to have the chicken shawarma wrap or the kofta next time."}
{"text":"Very tasty shawarma bowl with rice made with chicken broth - not too spicy but just right - will def visit again plus friendly lady at the counter, very clean"}
{"text":"So this joint is awesome for Falafels. 

My very picky pops came with me and was so impressed he's been backs. Few times since. Their hot sauce is great! Falafels fresh. And the toppings generous. 

The best part is the tabouli actually tasted the way it should and was delicious on my falafel sandwich. Did I mention the prices can't be beat for the portion sizes. 

The have a lunch special of a shawarma bowl (chicken) with rice for only 4.99! 

I highly recommend giving this place a try the owners are hard working and accommodating! I sure enjoy eating here and will be a regular I'm sure of it."}
{"text":"These days, Lazeez has been our go-to place for shawarmas/plates, bonus as it is just across the street from me.  Decided to try 5 stars last weekend for lunch. There were no one there when I was there. There were also no menus. They had white boards up but there was not anything on it, maybe they were just getting started? 
Anyways, I ordered 3 chicken shawarma plates and couple baklavas?.  GF say the baklava? was very good.  But the shawarma plates were ok.  There isn't enough sauce compared to what you get Lazeez, but still, I didn't find the taste to be as good or that strong.  Now the chicken on the other hand was very very good. It was very tasty and felt like it was done just right."}
{"text":"It used to be one of my shawarma go-to places but the last couple of times I've been really let down. First with the chicken being old and rubbery from sitting out too long and when I decided to give it another chance my shawarma was so flavorless!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken shawarma with all the fixings. Even better than Paramount (and they're pretty good). It's a small place that I go to simply because it's local, but I've never been disappointed.

You can order in or take out; you can order a shawarma plate or shawarma in a pita, whatever you like. And of course, it's all halal!

If you like Middle Eastern food at a good price, I strongly recommend that you check this place out."}
{"text":"Okay, this is so far the best chicken and rice dish (chicken fatah) i've tasted out of all the chicken on the rocks in Mississauga.

The service was fast and friendly, convenient location, and clean restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fatah and its honestly the closest to halal guys i've ever tatsed so far. And we all know that halal guys is the king of chicken/mix meat on rice in New York. Although this doesnt come with salad, we just ordered as is. They arent skimpy on the chicken and the sauce,  they also added fried pita chips for an added crunch..so GOOD!
 I ordered the mix grill shawarma and boyyy was it good! Growing up in Dubai, i've eaten a LOT of shawarma and i know whats in it! Definetely no lettuce, tomatoes and no pickles! I added onions, hummus, garlic paste and sauce, fries (a plus and must), turnip and thats it! This took me back to my hometown!

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Location closes at 10 and rushed to get there before it closed. Got there at 955 to order food and even though 2 people were in line waiting to order was turned away because they have to clean up. Very unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5/5

After a very long exhausting day of Christmas shopping I was craving a shawarma wrap... I bookmarked this place on Yelp and low and behold I was in the same plaza... Score!

The lady behind the counter seemed nice but also seemed like she was rushing me while there was no one in line. I ordered the regular size chicken shawarma with everything on it. The flavour was 5/5... Very fresh ingredients, authentic BUT There was very little chicken in my wrap. So sadly I was still hungry after chomping down  :(

Perhaps I'll come back to try something else and update my review."}
{"text":"Really good food here! Friendly staff, great taste, lots of seats. I got the chicken shawarma plate.  The only reason I docked one star is because I feel it didn't come with enough chicken for the price.  Other than that it's really good. I normally don't like potatoes, but the way they cooked it and the sauce used is amazing!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried the fata chicken plate which their take on chicken and rice and it was delicious. The chicken was nice and tender along with the rice but what distinguishes it from the rest is the addition of pita chips to the plate. The pita chips add a great crunch to the dish and elevates it. They do not over sauce the dish and you can always ask for more white sauce as well as hot sauce. My gf ordered the mix grill shawarma which was tasty and they do not skimp on the meat. The service was friendly and attentive. For about $13, you really get the bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ordered the jumbo chicken shwarma.

The bread was completely falling apart and unfortunately it was a just a messy pile of food.
Called them explaining the situation, hoping I could come tomorrow for a refund, when most convenient. 
No-refunds, exchanges only, I would have to come back with my wrap, and within the couples hours before they closed that night.

It's not worth it going back. Whatever, I'll eat my shwarma salad  
lol what a waste of $10"}
{"text":"Pretty close to 5Stars as per the establishment's name!

* knocked off for food arriving in styro - despite dining in, BUT it's good for leftovers - and I wished that potatoes were in smaller pieces, crunchier.  They were on the larger side and could be cooked a bit longer before being fried.

LOVED that the kofta was freshly made, not from frozen as I can taste from the texture of the meat.  I also loved, loved, LOVED the hummus and usually I'm not that big of a fan of it, especially when it comes out of a container from the grocery store.  :(  I could tell this spread was made in-house as well and I really like the seasoning that they used for it, YUM!

I had the Mixed Plate ($10.99, beef/chicken shawarma) and friend had Kofta ($9.99).  Both plates came with a small side of Fattoush Salad, Fried Potatoes, & Rice with White Garlic Sauce/Spicy Sauce if you request it.

Both Shawarmas were good, but Kofta was really tasty!  

Wait was approx. 10-15mins.  As soon as friend ordered the Kofta, the man behind the counter immediately said that it would take 10mins for that particular dish.

Would definitely stop by again, especially since it's not that far from where I live."}
{"text":"This place does not deserve a star.  Ordered through skip the dishes (never order through them again, they're also horrible at their job).  Never got my order right.  They did not follow instructions properly.  Received 2 out of the 4 things I ordered. Skip the dishes spoke to the restaurant owner to give me the rest of my missing order.  Restaurant even called me to read out my order  for confirmation.  Once it was delivered (for the second time) the fries to two of my combos was missing...... Asked them where my fries where and they said they did not give it to me because they ran out........why did they not tell me that before when he was reading out my order on the phone to confirm my missing order???? Never again.  Service is horrible.  Save yourself the time and hassle and go to other shawarma places that taste better and SERVE better.

Oh did I mention my food took 2 hours for everything to arrive? Yeah definitely a great place.....NOT."}
{"text":"Had this for lunch at work and they do not have any flavour. I give them a 2 star because they got the order correct. The chicken had no flavour and the garlic sauce was bland with no garlic. The portion was good and their prices are good. Thats it!! Sorry but this is not shawarma. This was more of a grilled chicken on rice."}
{"text":"5Stars Shawarma & Grill is located at the plaza on Mavis and Eglinton, across from Starbucks and beside Sam Woo. I came here for lunch on 2 consecutive days as I live nearby.

Day 1:  I ordered the super chicken shawarma wrap ($7.99), which is essentially a larger version of their regular shawarma wrap. As someone who enjoys spicy food, I ordered my wrap as I typically do with hot peppers, jalapeños, and hot sauce - bad decision. One thing about this restaurant is that they actually make their own hot sauce, which is awesome, but I recommend that you proceed to order it with caution because it is super spicy. If I could go back, I would have forgone the hot peppers and jalapeños and just stuck with the hot sauce. Consequently, I had trouble enjoying the shawarma due to the heat overpowering the rest of the ingredients, and only ended up finishing ~4/5 of my lunch. Another observation about their wraps is that they use romaine lettuce. Since I am typically accustomed to seeing ice berg lettuce used at other places (ex. Osmow's, Lazeez), it was a nice change.

Day 2: I ordered the shawarma bowl lunch special ($4.99), which is served with chicken or beef, rice, salad, and topped with garlic and hot sauce. A much better decision on my end, particularly because I was able to taste every individual ingredient. I thoroughly enjoyed this meal as the rice was cooked fresh, the chicken was well-marinated, and the mixture of the garlic and hot sauces paired very cohesively as they always do.

Overall: The service is fast and friendly, the food is pretty good, and the menu items are priced well relative to the many other, nearby competitors. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to come back if I'm in the area and craving shawarma."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and beef shawarma dinner (Potatoes, Rice Salad) i chose the salad with the crunchy stuff in it because it looked wet, I assumed it was a vinagrette of some sort but nope.. no dressing and the salad wasn't as fresh which is weird because i went around lunch and everything should be fresh.. it was completely empty when I went. I also got a Peach Bardican drink. The chicken and beef together with extra garlic sauce and just a bit of hot sauce is really good.. the rice didn't really have a fragance or flavor that I can remember and I had it yesterday.. that just means it was okay. I'd come here and try the chicken and beef pita next time. Of course I've had better. I hope they have Falafel? I think I want to try that as well.. anyway, enough about me ranting about what I want when I should be reviewing what I had! I enjoyes the baklava, it's not to sweet and it was decent. I cannot safely say if I recommend this place or not but they are not bad. The customer service was akward but decent and on point."}
{"text":"I got the $4.99 shawarma bowl. It tasted great and was only $4.99. You can pick from chicken, beef or a mix. You can also add potatoes for 50 cents. It came with a bit of salad and some rice. The chicken was tender and flavourful and the rice fresh. The garlic sauce was delicious too. I'm so glad there's a decent shawarma option in the area now."}
