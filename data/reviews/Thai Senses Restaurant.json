{"text":"Best thai food i've had. The food was fresh and delicious. We had Basil eggplant tofu and pad thai. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Of the 4 Thai places I've tried in Oakville, this is the best and most authentic. I eat there regularly and it's always good. I especially recommend the Drunk Noodles, which most Thai restaurants don't have on their menu but are DELICIOUS. Also, the Panang Curry.  I'd like to point out that I've never had the issues that the below Melanie H. did- mango salad has always been good (the mango isn't supposed to be ripe) and the dishes haven't tasted like they were made of ketchup or out of the freezer. The only thing I would recommend is that you clarify the spice levels for your dishes- they tend to err on the side of gringo-spice (none), so if you want it spicy, tell them."}
{"text":"Really authentic flavors,  inviting decor,  they deliver ( but not as good as in the restaurant),  worth going with a group to sample the menu. ... worth a visit. ... You'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple times and we also get takeout from them quite often. I have eaten at quite a lot of Thai restaurants in my life before and this place is pretty good.  I also haven't had any troubles like Melanie H had either. I think mango shouldn't be ripe for mango salad and every time I have had it it was perfectly seasoned and their Pad Thai is not ketchupy at all... and let me tell you I HATE KETCHUPY PAD THAI WITH PASSION! When I eat their Pad Thai I taste it is properly made with tamarind paste to give it sour taste and pickled vegetable to give it a little crunch and I really like that they put little cubes of fried tofu.  Their lunch menu is a bargain. For 8 dollars you get a spring roll and a choice of either soup (Tom Yum) or salad (Mango salad) and your entree. Most of the time I can't finish it on one go so I will have left over for the next day's lunch.  I recommend their curries, Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup. I tried their Som Tum (Young papaya salad) which was my staple in Thailand but unfortunately their Som Tum was not really my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Excellent  fare and enjoyable. Quiet ambiance. Always welcoming. Cookies home made. Favourite ginger tofu or basil eggplant. Love coconut rice. Mango salad a hit."}
{"text":"What a fun little place. I am from the States and really enjoyed this place. The orange chicken dish was perfect. It is a non-spicy dish but i requested a little bit of spice (but not enough to require a lot of water) and it turned out great. This place is made for any occasion. The prices are very fair and the staff is very kind."}
{"text":"Best Red Thai Chicken Curry in the GTA area !!!! delicious and always cooked to perfection great lunch deals very authentic place loved it !!"}
{"text":"We came again for lunch today in this Thai Sense restaurant! We chose it yesterday because of the convenient transportation, but after trying it, we decided to come back today! We love every dishes, green curry, yellow curry, Thai tigger shrimp, basil stir-fried rice, pineapple fried rice, tom yum, pad Thai, and the mango coconut rice is the must try!"}
{"text":"On the plus side, the red curry dish was quite good. The interior design was also quite good. All ingredients are fresh which is not always the case for Thai restaurants.   Unfortunately the hot and sour soup was mediocre. The veggie fried rice did not taste at all fried and lacked any flavour. Spicy Basil Chicken with level 4 spice had very little spice and hence lacked any flavour. One of the most disappointing Thai meals we had."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you're suddenly unsure if you're in a restaurant or a jewelry shop.  Several dining tables are covered with jewelry and collectibles.  I realize this doesn't bother everyone, but for me it came off as crass and tacky.  The food was OK, but not memorable or special.  The papaya salad was good, but the mango salad and \"BBQ\" chicken was very bland and not at all what I expect from a Thai place.  I've eaten authentic Thai food many dozens of times and if what the other reviewers say is true - that it's the best \"most authentic\" Thai in Oakville...then Thai in Oakville isn't very good period."}
{"text":"It's local, delivers, and was tasty. Not my favourite Thai food but for the cost and close by I really liked it. Been 3 times."}
{"text":"I asked for a delivery. The food was still hot, boiling and fresh! Great customer service on the phone even after I asked what they would recommend. Very patient and quick service, they said 45 minute wait for delivery when it took about 20mins! Amazing food and service!  Ordered  Sweet and sour fish  Pad Thai  Crispy shrimp rolls   All was amazing and fresh!   $40 for two people who eat a lot, we were full!"}
{"text":"We tend to grab takeout from here at least twice a month! (Sometimes more). Let me tell you, the food is phenomenal. Their customer service is great and the staff is a pleasure to deal with.  Did I mention the food (ESP the green chicken curry) is phenomenal?  We found this place accidentally and am so glad we did."}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai dishes!  Tried the Green Chicken Curry, Tom Yum Soup and Drunken Noodles with Beef.  Everything was delicious.  The service was prompt and friendly.  They even had homemade cookies available for sale - small takeout containers for $3.00!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the good reviews... We were disappointed in what we got.   You know sometimes you get your \"authentic\" food, and then most other times you get your \"fusion\" cuisine. Thai Senses is a fusion thai restaurant.   1. Shrimp Tom yum soup was too Salty. There was an overload of fish sauce flavouring. At the level 2 spice, there was way too much minced lemongrass and minced pepper. I was choking on the residue from every spoon of soup.   2. Special Pad Thai was too saucy. Maybe because I know what pad Thai is supposed to be like.. I was a tad critics here.   3. Grilled beef salad, was generally good. Slices of grilled beef sitting in a bed of shredded cabbage with fish sauce marinade.   Overall, if you are agreeable with fusion food; then this is a good place for you. If you have a certain expectation for the what you are going to eat... then this place is not for you.   Service was friendly - oh, and they have this odd flea-market set up in the middle of the restaurant...   Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten take out as the interior of the restaurant does not look inviting. Some meals where good. I liked the mango chicken,the steamed vegetables and the spring rolls. However,  I ordered a sea food dish that looked like curdled milk... In addition, the portion size of the rice was sooooo small."}
{"text":"Not as good as expected, after reading all the good reviews I was really excited to try out this restaurant. As I am on a quest to find the best Pad Thai in the GTA... (perharps I should visit Thailand at this point).   The vegetable pad thai with a two level pepper was a disappointment. We ordered take out and brought it home, after taking my first bite I was already overwelmed by how spicy it was.  The Pad Thai was also very dry and bland. It seemed like it was only cooked with hot sauce. So I decided to recook it by adding tamarind and mushroom oyster sauce. Only then it was bearable to consume.  P.s  If a two level pepper was that spicy I don't even wanna know how spicy a five level pepper would taste like. I think it would burn my insides to ashes."}
{"text":"I visit Thailand occasionally and this place has the best thai food I've had in Toronto, comparable to food in Thailand. i love the papaya salad, pepper shrimp glass noodle dish , the red curry and the mango sticky rice. I highly recommend this place if you want a taste of great authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Thai restaurants in the GTA. It has hands down the best Green Curry Thai chicken dish in Oakville. It is rich in flavour, a thicker sauce made with real coconut milk, with green eggplants, sliced bamboo shoots, thick slices of chicken and not very spicy. I recommend the lunch portion with the spring roll, it makes a great sizeable meal for a fill up. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They deliver!!!  It came fast and was delicious - got green curry and Mango juice! Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"Did not update their hours. Went today to find a paper attached to their front door notifying customers that they would open at 4pm..."}
{"text":"This was a mixed bag of an experience. The wonton soup, beef satay, mango salad, and bubble tea were on the bland side.  The quality of the food was good but it lacked flavour. The grilled beef, while advertised as medium spicy was actually very spicy, and otherwise also lacked flavor. The pork ribs, calamari, and fried bananas on the other hand were excellent. The service was decent, though they had a mixup with the appetizers which caused them to come after the mains.  Overall I found it overpriced, and wouldn't go back, but some items were quite good."}
{"text":"Love the food and the ambiance. Drunken noodles is highly recommended. Tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood. Perfect for families and celebrations. All the dishes are worth trying."}
