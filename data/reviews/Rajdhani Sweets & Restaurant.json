{"text":"My go-to Indian restaurant, I've never been disappointed. It's 100% vegetarian, affordable and delicious. Parking can be tricky. Don't let the plaza discourage you, the food is delicious and the girls who work there are very nice. They curries often times change but they have the staples like daal and palak paneer."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times and don't think I want to come back again.  There are so many good thali places in GTA, I am surprised why this place is popular.  Food: 3/5 too oily, nothing special, ordinary and sadly tastes like it's been out for days and days.  Service: 1/5 a lot of shouting from servers and no greetings/manners   Ambience and location: 0/5 way too cramped, floors are sticky and dirty, tables are dirty, it sort of kills the appetite. And it's been this way during all of my visits. So I doubt it was a one time thing.  Price: 5/5 it's very reasonably priced, but quality is what matters. I would rather pay a couple of dollars more for better food. And in all honesty in the same price range you can get better Thalis in other GTA locations."}
{"text":"Looking for something greasy? Indian? Vegetarian? Head on over to Rajdhani and order a thali - an assortment of various dishes served in a silver round tray - kinda like tapas for those non-South Asians out there.  Afterwards, down it all with alot of water.  While I like this place, I'll only eat here once or twice a year, it's a greasy spoon. The decor on the inside is simple; the interior slightly awkward to navigate through - the seating arrangement is designed to maximize the most of the limited square footage. Oh, and the area this place is in ain't that pretty, so beware.   Despite some strange affection to this place I'll only give it 2*'s."}
{"text":"So this is pre-renovation Salad King meets Indian Food.Order at the counter, find a seat and listen for someone to yell your number. There is little to no pretension to this place. Decor and comfort are minimal. They pump out good quality Indian Vegetarian food and that's about it. Get the thali, and go nuts. There isn't a bad choice for your dishes. I'm a huge fan of their kofta. Every time I go back to Toronto this is my 2nd food stop."}
{"text":"One of the top 5 places around Toronto to have good authentic Indian vegetarian food. I love the punjabi flavours they have in their dishes. Cannot beat value for money for the veg thali.  And 3 big samosas for $1 is hands down the winner if you are hungry and have no time to sit and eat.  Highly recommend their Palak paneer, Daal Makhani, Muter Paneer, Chole, Naan, Samosas and Pav Bhaji."}
{"text":"Good quality and great value. I have been coming here for over eight years and it remains one of my favourite vegetarian takeout restaurants. I'm not even sure how they're able to keep the prices so low. The Jalebis are to die for! Thank you for existing!   P.S. the only downfall is trying to find parking in the plaza"}
{"text":"Its 5:30pm on a Tuesday, there are only three people in the restaurant including myself.  I ordered a veg. thali and it takes 15 mins.  to get my order.  The place is dead compared to other days.  I would expect to have my order quick especially considering the food is already made.   I like the food here and some of the staff are nice. That's why i keep coming back but the wait time is terrible.   I don't know the names of some of the dishes.  I guess one suggestion i could make for not just this restaurant but others similar to this is to put a label on each dish. It would attract more customers as they would not be as intimidated."}
{"text":"This place has the best nan bread, it's so good.  The food is authentic vegetarian Indian food.  I admit the sitting area is not too big and appealing.  But the food really triumphant that.  The value is really good too.  When ordering the Vege Thali, you don't have to order a sweet dish if you don't like it.  You can get another vege curry dish instead, no extra charge."}
{"text":"Yet again another amazing experience!!! Great food. Fresh. Variety. Cheap. And amazing service!!!   I just wish I didn't have to empty my dishes into the garbage and bins. It looks gross a little.   They have renovated since my last visit. New tables and chairs!!! But they need another TV. It's nice to watch the Bollywood actors and listen to the music."}
{"text":"It's good but the staff is a bit rude. Since last 2-3 weeks I have been to this place 3 times but still the behavior is same. Food is ok. I just like jalebi and imarti that's all. Otherwise all the curries have same taste."}
{"text":"Pros: - Naan is amazing. Seriously good!!  - Thali is at a great price for the quantity. Value = extremely high! - Malai kofta was exquisite. Mushroom masala was amazing.  Cons: - Place is pretty small. It had around 9 tables and none of them seated more than 4, unless you counted the first table which is near the main door. This table is usually avoided as cold air enters through every time someone enters the restaurant. Fix the seating arrangement/interior and EASY 5 stars!! :) - Achari paneer was too dry and not as tasty as I would have liked.  Verdict: Takeout!!"}
{"text":"Neat bright diner with simple and easy to read menus. Prices are cheap, seating area is limited compared to Brars but it's slightly cheaper and a bit less grungy looking. I ordered a veggie thali for $7.30 with tax."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and puck some sweets. If you keep your eyes and nose close outside and make your way inside then you can find great sweets and decent Punjabi vegetarian food. There is a pan shop next door and outside is coated with people spitting that on side walks. Disgusting:( ordered a thali and you can pick which sides. Do not order puri since the one I got was cold and made who knows when. Completely deflated and was more like batura instead of puri (supposed to be fluffy but was chewy). Chana was bit hard and so was ghobi... they had some rice and attempted salad but both were not edible. Ended taking a spoon each and throwing rest away. Naan looked fresh. All in all people who miss home cooked Punjabi meal should visit. There are Ana poorna in Santa Clara with better taste yet home cooked. Sweets looked good and yet have to try them. Will visit again if the outside area gets bit cleaner."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's way out of the way from just about everything but I make the hour plus transit journey frequently on weekends. The food is delicious. It's not the best Indian food you'll ever eat, but it is pretty darn tasty just the same. I live for their saag. The naan is freshly made and so good I've never bothered getting any other roti. The gajar ka halwa is also dreamy. Soooo sugary and soooo buttery. The food isn't terribly hot-spicy but I find it's increased in heat a little over the last couple of years. The excellent part is that for like 7 bucks you get three veg dishes of your choice, roti, rice, dessert, and pickle. It leaves you stuffed. Way better than most buffets for a lot less money.   The other handy thing about this place is that you can pick up all manner of sweets to take home for your diabetic coma needs. One can never have enough jalebi or burfi in my opinion. Anyway, if you are hungry in Etobicoke or looking for a nice long bus ride then I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Everything was extremely delicious. Amazing flavours. Very good naan.  One of the best samosas I've ever had. Good service."}
{"text":"Like Singh A., I've got a pretty soft spot for this little Vegetarian dig in the seedy Albion-Islington nook.   Thali-style restaurants fill that falafel type of fast food niche where Indian cuisine is concerned. For $5.99 you get an assortment of dishes with dessert, rice and buttery naan. Though lots of the items are greasy and 'whited out' the variety and presentation is great. Don't expect a spice-attack because you won't get it. The food just isn't that spicy. It's high on salt.   The mango and plain lassis are made really well here, though sometimes a little too sweet for my liking so adjust your order accordingly, because they're very accommodating to requests. Customer service is great and I've repeated my visits to Rajdhani as it's a lot cleaner than its competitors nearby."}
{"text":"Right on bovaird , location is convenient. We tried twice but we're not convinced with the taste of food !  Breads were good but gravies needs attention !"}
{"text":"Ordered catering   Reasonable prices and really tasty food with generous quantities   Ordered methi malai gravy, dal makhani, paneer achari with tava roti  I wouldn't recommend the naan since they get chewy if kept out for long . Sticky with tava roti which comes. Ask to make it without oil   Cheers"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.They sre selling uncooked and raw food and they call it Indian food.When asked they replaced the same and the Indian drinks tastes like medicine,they must be expired and selling without expiry on it. Never going to return back here."}
{"text":"My extended family catered food from here for Thatha's satyanarayana puja and his 70th birthday. Apparently this place can prepare food w/o garlic and onions for the above stated ritual. The white rice w/peas (veg pulao?), malai kofta, mixed vegetable curry, mattar paneer, and bhoodi raita were all on point. Naan looked slightly different than most of what I've seen but it was still delicious nonetheless. There are so many Indian restaurants here and in my 6-7 times I've been here over the years, it's been great to try so many of them out because they are all so tasty."}
{"text":"Upon a friend's insistence we landed here one fine Sunday evening. The place is nestled away barely noticeable amidst a plethora of Indian shops. I was surprised by how unclean the carpet was. You could see the left overs strewn across trash can even before making it to register.   Man this place is dirt cheap. And worth it. We got Thali for $6.50, Paav Bhaji for $5.50 and Ras Malai for $2.50  All good stuff. They have a big assortment of sweets at $8 per pound which I will try during our next visit. That is if I can overlook the unsanitary ambiance. And don't even think about using the washroom. Stairs leading downstairs are hazardous :("}
{"text":"This place is not where you should take your date or go out with your friends if you want somewhere to chill or share a drink. If, however, you're in the area, hungry, looking for a place to have a bite, this is it. For $6.49+tax you'll get a big metal plate with rice, salad and 4 options of veggies. No, there's no chicken, meat, lamb, fish or any other traditional options. This place is strictly vegetarian, but man their food is tasty. Where else can you pay $7 for a healthy meal that'll leave you full? I don't know that many places in Toronto. The value for the money is unbeatable IMHO.  Today was my first time here and I absolutely loved the food. Did I mention that they sell traditional Indian sweets, which are equally good?"}
{"text":"I love to try foods from different cultures, and I found this place while on the bus and decided to check it out...I got 2 veg. Thali's for my sister and myself, we were so excited! The food was decent the plating and packaging are so neat!! And the staff are nice I happened to get extra naan so my total came up to 21$ not bad actually! The only complaints I have is that there was a pepper of some sort that was fried and I ate it and it was extremely bitter I had to spit it out, also the naan tasted sour I've never had naan like that. I was an experience and I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"When I walked through the door, I could tell this was going to be a real authentic Indian restaurant. The food here is delicious. The sweets are fresh and the staff let's you sample before you buy. Prices and service are fair.   If parking is full, park across the street.   I would highly recommend it and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Pure vegetarian restaurant. Great and tasty North Indian food. Lunch combo nominal price and tasty curries. Chaats are very nice. Paav bhaji Gulab jamun parathas badam milk are popular and tasty here"}
