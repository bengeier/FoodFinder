{"text":"Chef Bob, your salt and vinegar crusted perch is amazing! This is a must try for all fish fry lovers. Aside of that, anything on the menu is worth a trip here. Hidden gem in Monona."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Went for fish tonight.  Except for being a bit noisy the bartenders were great, the cod was perfect, the waitstaff was excellent but the check in service was terrible!  Hostess checked us in at 6:00pm (said it would be 20 minutes). At 6:35 we re-checked but they seated others and lost our reservation for two!  We had to wait another 20 minutes to be seated!!  Their check in service was horrible!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but after 2 tries, I'm done. My first visit was about a month ago for happy hour. Service was excellent. The place has a great atmosphere and the drinks are good, but the tacos were dry and the noodle bowl was cold. I thought maybe it was just an off day, and decided to give them another try for brunch today. Oh man. I ordered the duck confit hash, which featured about 3 bites of dry duck and the most sadly overcooked eggs I've ever been served. I didn't eat it, and seriously, I eat anything. My friend had an underwhelming frittata with dry (I'm sensing a theme?) sausage. She said the whole thing tasted overcooked. THEN it started raining. We were the only table out on the patio, so when 3 employees came out I thought they would offer to help us move our plates inside. No. They started clearing the silverware rolls off the unoccupied tables. I worked in restaurants for over 10 years, I get it, rolling silverware is the worst, but SERIOUSLY one of you could have offered to help your customers. 5 minutes after we moved inside our server finally asked if we wanted our food. Sure, it's probably delicious now that it's a puddle. Bartenders were friendly, but somehow we got charged for an extra cocktail, at which point I just signed the bill and got out. I might go back for drinks but honestly probably not."}
{"text":"Did a Friday night here with three other couples a couple weeks after it opened. The decor looks nice and is a big upgrade from the old Bourbon Street. The place was maybe 3/4 full but the service was slow. Our server did a couple of table fly-bys to acknowledge us but it took 15 minutes to get our drink order in and another 20 for our food. Smaller selection of beers and liquor than most places in the area but enough to wet your whistle.  On the plus side the food did come out pretty quickly. I had the Cuban sandwich which was o.k. Others in the group had the fish and liked it. This will be a good place to stop at while boating on the lakes."}
{"text":"The previous incarnation at this location didn't quite hit the mark, so we'd been looking forward to the opening of The Breakwater for most of the summer. We boated in on an early Friday evening and headed straight up to the the outdoor patio/ bar. My initial reaction was meh, as nothing had changed since new ownership took over. The tables and walk-up bar were still the old, tired design from the old place. It wasn't clear if there was table service and, after sitting for 5 or so minutes, we decided to order our drinks at the bar. Things didn't go so well as we clearly interrupted a conversation between the bartender and another employee. There was no beer list available and I had to crane my neck to see the taps, additionally, the cooler with bottled/canned beer was in such disarray that I couldn't even figure out those selections. After ordering a refreshing pint of Bells Oberon, we settled in at a table overlooking the boat traffic on the channel.Should have been a beautiful summer evening, right? Wrong! We had intended on having dinner, as well, but the odor from the sewer pump out was so offensive we took our beer back to the boat and headed out to Lake Waubesa for dinner elsewhere. I really wanted to like The Breakwater, the Madison chain of lakes has a dearth of restaurants for boaters and I was hoping this was going to fill that gap! The lackluster upper patio and awful sewer odor were incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a tough review - I was here with my husband and daughter and it was as if we were at 3 different restaurants. I had the Brussels sprout salad and it was amazing. I would order it again at any of the top restaurants in Madison. So I wanted to give Breakwater a great review. My daughter's Mac and cheese was runny and nothing special. Which for any restaurant touting local food in Wisconsin seems like a serious oversight. The diner down the road (cranberry creek) has better Mac and cheese. But a kids menu slip up might be forgiven if not for my husband's noodle bowl. It arrived cold, had very little flavor and, as my husband said, was \"not good.\" The cheese curd appetizer was very good and the beignet desert was solid. But as much as I initially wanted to score it higher - as it is a welcome addition to monona - I have to settle on 3 stars for now. Hope to come back again and score it higher."}
{"text":"What an amazing new restaurant with lovely shaded outside seating at the dinner hour. The service was impeccable. We enjoyed cheese curds and truffle fries that were yummy but the salad with brussel sprouts and the marinated sirloin were absolutely gourmet. The key lime pie was a standout for dessert. There are 13 slips for boaters to pull up."}
{"text":"The claim of \"farm to table\" and \"craft cocktails\" is mere lip service. My wife and dined there the this week and having just opened, they are pretty far away from being ready for prime time. The bar service was poor, appetizer came out lukewarm and the meal was less than okay. If you enjoy trying to get aioli on a limp frite, you found the right place. The sandwich featured a bun that I am pretty sure came out of Woodman's bakery section (pretty sure I use the same sub buns for kids lunches). The noodle bowl my wife ordered was lukewarm and flavors were not at all balanced. My wife said she felt like she had just smoked a cigarette, describing the aftertaste left in her mouth. It was a greater disappointment because the chef formerly worked under Dan Fox who sets a high standard for food quality and service. If you like old fashions, look elsewhere and expect an up-charge of $2 on a rail drink for an orange slice, maraschino cherry in a weak drink, muddling not included."}
{"text":"Great beer selection to start.  Service was a bit slow to start but very pleasant.  Food was great. Salt and Vinegar chip coated walleye was the Friday special and was served with a large portion of tasty slaw and very addictive, thin and crunchy house-made potato chips. The brussels sprouts salad was very substantial and very delicious. Roasted sprouts, squash, goat cheese, chunks of bacon and port soaked cranberries. So good.  We will go back for sure.  Thanks for coming to Monona :)"}
{"text":"The food was alright, nothing real special.  The service was kind of slow even though there wasn't a lot of people.  They wasn't anybody to seat and serve us immediately so one of the owners ended up seating us and taking our order.  The place has potential but they just can't seem to do any one thing great."}
{"text":"We love The Breakwater. So much that we actually had out wedding reception there this past September. We did a buyout of the entire space and everything was absolutely perfect. I cannot thank Chef Bob, Tim, Nals (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) and the rest of the staff enough for making our special day a dream come true. We had a lot of special requests and they made everything happen for us. And the food, the food was amazing! We had a \"strolling dinner\" with two carving stations, a mac and cheese bar, shrimp cocktail, small bites and so much more for dinner with pizza and build your own nachos as our late night snacks. Everyone loved everything about our day. There was not a single compliant. All of the staff was very accommodating and wonderful to work with. They pulled off a fantastic event! If you're looking for a unique event space, look no further than the Breakwater!"}
{"text":"We came in on a late Thursday evening. The staff was super friendly and accommodating but the food was average if not slightly above. I'll be back because it's convenient and reliable, but not necessarily because I can't wait to try their food again."}
{"text":"Food is not inexpensive but very well prepared. We had the breaded Perch and the Pesto Fettuccine (with Chicken & Shrimp, paid extra) . Both were very good although Fettuccine was slightly dry - could have used more Pesto or a light sauce. Garlic Shrimp was great. Had two margaritas. First was weak, second was much stronger & better. Dessert was large and very good. Took home 1/3 of dinner for another great meal! Our server Aubrey was great. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We went today for brunch -excellent. Great service & unique menu. Farm fresh veggies, awesome hollandaise sauce & great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Been here several times when it was still Bourbon Street Grill, always enjoyed my time. Since the new owners took over, we were curious about the improvements made, so we decided to dock and check it out. Told some friends we would pick them up here to jump on the boat. In retrospect this was a bad choice because there isn't an easy way back to the docks, without going through the restaraunt.  They had a small cooler they were planning on taking on the boat. Breakwater said they couldn't bring it through. I get they don't want anyone BYOBing, that is fair, but we are talking about walking through. C'mon. Strike 1. On the way back we had a grocery bag full of cans to recycle from an afternoon on the lake. As we were about to throw them in the garbage can on the doc, we were told from Breakwater that our garbage wasn't their problem. Thought he was joking, he wasn't joking. Strike two. We ordered some drinks on the main deck to hang for a bit and finish out the Badger/LSU game. Six of us, plus a couple babies, sat down at a table on an empty deck after paying for drinks. Same guy from earlier asks us if we were going to be eating. Since we were not, he told us to move up to the third deck. Strike 3. Bartenders were great and accommodating, but this guy with a powertrip needs some learning disability level customer service skills. Lost us, but hope for their sake this guy gets let go. Didn't catch his name, but we were there in the afternoon twice on 9/3/2016."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Breakwater in Monona not only for the great food but first class service!  My friend & I stopped in on Friday when we were out boating & once Chef Bob found out I had just acquired my boat and was in the naming process, he sprung for a bottle of Blu Prosecco to christen the newly named boat!  BTW we have a video LOL. The fish sandwich we had was great with some red cabbage and wonderful aioli sauce added the perfect touch!  Very reasonable prices.  We learned they have great music lined up & will definitely tell everyone we know about this great place on the Yahara River!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Breakwater for the first time during their Mother's Day buffet this weekend. Everything we tried was great; the roast beef, omelet station, and French toast were delicious. We got there pretty late, but the staff is what set this place apart. Every single encounter we had with staff was amazing. It's obvious that ownership really cares about their customers. Really looking forward to coming back and trying their regular menu! Oh and Chef Bob is awesome!"}
{"text":"We (4 adults and a 4-year old) stopped by here to watch the beginning of the Badger game (so about 2:15pm on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend) and came by boat. Although, one of the best features of this location is the 3-story outdoor seating areas, we needed to sit inside to see the game. The 2 large TVs in the bar area had perfectly crisp pictures. We chose a 6-top between the 2 and everyone had a great view.   Two of us ordered from their specialty cocktail menu. And both were delicious and good sized. They were served in rather small (but interesting) glasses and came with an extra glass containing more cocktail. Nice!  Once reviewing the menu we decided to try the $25 poutine. $25 for poutine? One of the barkeeps, Drew, assured us it was the best he's had So we went with it and were very pleased. The portion was huge. It was covered with very good get and shaved truffles. I suggested they offer a half order, as this would be way too much for just two people. We also shared the Brussels sprout salad, which was also quite good. My daughter had the cheese burger with fruit off the kids menu (they only offer a cheeseburger, mac & cheese, and a grilled cheese). It was a nicely sized burger, probably a quarter pound, and came with a grilled bun. The fruit was fresh melon, raspberries, strawberries and blueberries. Perfect! I posted pics of both the truffles and kids burger.   Service was good -- plenty of staff there, even though it wasn't very busy. Overall we we quite pleased and happy there's another good spot to enjoy via boat in the area!"}
{"text":"New Years Eve dinner was beyond belief.  Best Prime Rib...ever.  Great wine.  Great atmosphere.  This place is so ready to break out!!!   Wow."}
{"text":"Went back to Breakwater to eat somewhere outside and because BF likes the wings. Service was much better this time and can really make such a difference. Winona our waitress was awesome -- fast, accurate, friendly and knowledgeable. The place seemed to be keeping pace with the big outdoor crowd and a reception. The first time we visited earlier this spring that was a struggle for them. The seafood chowder and fish fry were pretty decent too."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here after we read about their Poutine!!  We both may have a slight Poutine obsession, and had to try it.  Our server was friendly, the Poutine was AMAZING, and the service was good....quick and reliable, a huge upgrade from Bourbon Street.  Based upon only one experience, I would say this place is great - and I only gave it four stars because I personally do not believe that any dish that includes fries as its main base should be $25.  $18 Poutine?  Yes, definitely.  $20? Maybe...but man, I don't think I'd pay $25 for a Poutine again.  That definitely didn't stop us from trying it though and we don't regret it!  ...and for what it's worth my brother says I'm nuts and the toppings alone are worth the $25 price tag."}
{"text":"Great time at the breakwater happy hour was great they go all out to make sure everything is good if you don't like something to cook the bartender and the manager will come visit you to make sure you're happy I have the French Youngin soup and catfish those were excellent my wife had the red wine reduction chicken... it was pretty powerful so be prepared my friend had the salmon he said it was great they also have gluten free...  Sit outside it was lovely just watch out for the wind."}
{"text":"Attended second week of August, and the whole party was disappointed.  We were really looking for a new place to hang outside on the water.  The Good: Service was wonderful, with our waitress being really attentive, and shoveling drinks over and over. The view overlooking the water is beautiful, and enough to get us back one more time.  There was no wit, and very few people there for 6 pm on a weekday.  Plenty of room to park.  The upgrade over the Bourbon Street Grille is noticeable, and they did a slick job with barnwood, tile and clean lines.  The Bad: The Pizza was embarrassingly bad, after they hyped it as the best dish on the menu. Imagine taking an inch of think dough and putting flavored ketchup on it (but not enough).  It didn't say 'deep dish' on the menu, and we were all surprised.  We fought over who would take the leftovers home, but not the good way.  Dogs were the big winners that night, and they ate a lot.  They need to re-write the menu, work on the pizza, and shave the prices a little, and they should get the volume this place could deserve.  I really want to see it work, but so far, not so much."}
{"text":"This place is just so great! The manager is wonderful. It has a local, non-corporate feeling. They care about their service, food, and drinks! I LOVE their Brussel sprout salad and fish sandwich. The cocktails are poured generously and they make you feel at home. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Soooo wanted this place to be good.......sorely we were disappointed. Our server admitted he had only been there a week, but simple things like taking close to 20 minutes to bring a table of 4 drinks...(managing to only bring 3 and forgetting the 4th), checking on us after our food was delivered, waiting another 15 minutes to get the check.....It never came, so we went inside to find it. Calamari appetizer was served cold, they \"generously\" offered to take it off our bill when it was sent back. Burgers were served ala carte (i.e. they are too cheap to include fries or chips with their burgers). I believe it was the manager who continuously apologized to us and seemed truly apologetic about the poor experience that was Breakwater, he also comp'd our round of drinks which was nice. I would love to say that because of his efforts we would go back, but there are far to many other good restaurants in Madison to risk another repeat of an overall subpar experience."}
{"text":"Decent place not overly exciting food is ok, atmospheres nice on the water, Service was a little slow that you were there they were fairly busy"}
{"text":"We have been here quite a few times now and it is always good.  The staff is always friendly along with the service being good.  They always have a daily lunch and dinner special.  We recently ate here on Thursday evening and the turkey wrap special was really good.  Now, it is just a turkey wrap but it had REAL turkey in it.  It wasn't deli meat.  Everything was fresh.  The house dressing on the side salad was delicious!  It made eating a salad enjoyable!  :-)  The cocktail and beer menu is solid.  It is such a perfect place to go by boat in the summer, but you have to keep them in business in the winter months too!"}
{"text":"meh. Yes I intended the meh to be lower case. I had higher expectations for this place. I'm only giving it 2 stars because my husband's potato crusted walleye and fries were actually pretty good. The issue I had was with my dinner, the service and atmosphere.    Let's start with the service. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. That was when we actually saw her. I don't blame her necessarily. I think they are understaffed and have poorly trained the waitstaff. I had to prompt her to tell me the specials. Then when I asked about the price of one, she had to go ask the manager (who by the way was sitting at the bar within earshot and was unaware that dish was a special). After I ordered it, it took her 15 minutes to come back and ask how I wanted that steak. The place wasn't even half full and our dinners arrived at least 30 minutes after we ordered it.     Next the atmosphere. I have always been confused by the layout. It seems part pub part church basement. There is no cohesiveness. They even booked the front room for some paid talk that people were filing in as we left. I would never disparage a restaurant for making money where and when they can. More power to them. It just seemed odd. I don't know if it was a \"how to get rich quick\" seminar or \"find the power within you\", but it was a little odd.    Lastly let's talk about my dinner.  If you are featuring a special, then making it special. At least make sure it is damn good.     I ordered the sirloin with haystack onion rings and garlic mashed potatoes. When it came, it looked very presentable and smelled great. That lasted about 10 seconds until I tried to cut into my steak. When the first experience I have with my beef is trying to saw and saw and saw to get through it, that is an issue. It was cooked to medium to medium-rare but it was a horrible cut of meat. Come on! I was born in South Dakota and live now in Wisconsin. I know a good piece of steak.     Then there was the issue of the mashed potatoes or more accurately named smashed potatoes. They were fine, nice flavor with a hint of garlic. That was until I hit the 4 large pieces of undercooked potato hiding underneath the top layer. Two minutes would have saved these potatoes from being just OK to very tasty.    I may give this restaurant another try, but I won't be extremely eager to go."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.   It was a busy Friday evening, service was great, food arrived quickly and was well prepared.   I had the salt and vinegar chip crusted Walleye which was tasty with a good portion size"}
{"text":"This place was so fun! We rode our bikes over on a nice day and sat on the patio. It was fifty cent wings special so we tried them. Wings were nice and big, could have used a bit more sauce. We also got the perch sandwich which was crusted in potato chips. Very delicious. Lastly we got the fried beet salad. This is quite a substantial salad! I will definitely be back especially on a nice day!"}
{"text":"I see it's been a year since I was last at the Breakwater. It was a hot night in September and it's one of the few places with outdoor dining on the water so we went. Of course everyone else thought the same thing so the outdoor seating was booked. We decided to wait with a cocktail and it was a long wait. There was lots of waitstaff running around franticly but it seemed to us to be disorganized.  We finally got a table outside but it was dark by now so we couldn't read the menu without the trusty phone spotlight. We ordered but were soon attacked by swarms of mosquitoes which our waitress said would only get worse, so decided  to eat at the inside bar. Everyone was very nice but we had three different servers at the bar who seemed surprised that we were sitting there. Long waits between seeing them as well. We finally got the food, broiled cod for me and catfish for my companion. Both were very good no complaints at all, but by now I was irritated by the long waits and the screwy service. The inside of the restaurant was pretty much empty most of the evening so I guess just the outside kept everybody so busy. Other restaurants are equally busy but manage to get things done in a timely fashion so I don't know whats wrong here. I give it one less star this time for the slow pace but the food here is pretty good."}
{"text":"I just dined at Breakwater, the 4th time I have been there. The atmosphere is laid back, the service good and the food is great! My husband ordered the onion rings for a side and they were HUGE, lightly battered, not too greasy and he had no trouble eating them all; and it was a big serving! I had the Reuben with a side of truffle fries, both great and I truly think this was one of the best Reuben sandwiches I have ever had. A perfect place, especially in the summer, where you can relax and watch the boats go by and also eat some great food.  Needless to say we will be back, probably again and again."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here on a Friday.  We found a lot of items on the menu that were appealing but decided on a Reuben sandwich, clam chowder, white cheddar cheese curds, and the Brussels sprout salad.  All the servings were plentiful and delicious.  My friend asked for \"light on the sauerkraut\" and the chef obliged, and there was plenty of corned beef to make a hefty sandwich. (Although surprised no side dish came with it). The soup was tasty and we ate every single curd and loved the Cajun aioli that came with them.  My salad was outstanding and I look forward to ordering it again. The servers were nice and very attentive. I was sorry to see only a few tables taken and hope that this hidden gem gets the attention it deserves.  It's on the Yahara river channel and would be a lovely place to eat in summer.  On a winter day we sat by the window and enjoyed watching a few geese go by."}
{"text":"I cannot speak to the quality of the food, because we left before ordering. This pub has given in to the flawed business model of having inflated prices AND and an a la carte menu.  $10 - $13 for a sandwich or burger without a side dish, and then an additional $2 - $3 for a side is expensive.  More and more restaurants are doing it, and I choose to not support any of them. Just offer a complete meal for a fair price without trying to hide cost.  The atmosphere is nice and the service staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Lunched there with 2 others for the first time. Had the roasted broccoli salad which was excellent. The others had soup & salad & also said it was very good. The server was very pleasant & efficient. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. We'll be going back and taking friends next time. Had the perch hoagie. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but what put this restaurant over the top was their Chef! Chef Bob I believe? When we asked for the menu for the dessert the chef came and told us in detail about the menu. He was very nice and obviously passionate about his work. The porter chocolate cake was amazing. He is a real asset to this place."}
{"text":"I loved the view from this place and the inside decor. But that's where my love pretty much ends. Came here on a Friday night with my coworkers for a bridal shower. We sat at a long table in the bar area but next to windows overlooking the deck and water. The place was steady but not insanely busy. Appeared to have one bartender who was slow and way behind. There was a line at the bar and my coworkers gave up waiting. Eventually ordered drinks through the waitress but the bartender took forever to make them. Actually one of our 12 drinks arrived. 10 Minutes later maybe 2-3 more arrived. When my brandy old fashion was not very good not made the way I had asked it to be. I had one that was 10x better an hour earlier at a restaurant near by that also overlooked the water. We were all disappointed with our service so far and were apprehensive about ordering food but we didn't want to move such a large group to a new place.  I found something on the menu that I thought sounded great, Salmon and Sprouts. SALMON AND SPROUTS $17: wild caught, garlic roasted, salmon served on crispy Brussel sprouts, with a chardonnay oregano drizzle served with sweet potato fries. It came with A choice of soup or salad. I opted for the French Onion soup. It looked great when it arrived but the taste of it was a bit wrong and too strong, my coworker felt the same. I eventually  found a huge bay leaf in my bowl. When my entree arrived I was disappointed in the salmon. I found it to be a bit dry. The Brussels sprouts were okay but a bit black and over cooked for my liking. I did like the sweet potato fries with some aioli that randomly was on my coworkers plate of fish fry and mashed potatoes. I think hey meant to put tarter sauce on her plate but accident gave her aioli and ranch dressing. Not sure if I'd come back for a second attempt."}
{"text":"Great Friday night fish fry with the family,  was there earlier last year and service and food were dos so, but dinner tonight was fast, delicious, original and reasonably priced!  Service was super!"}
{"text":"Host was sooo awkward.  Waitress didn't know what kind of mix the bloody marys were made with nor was willing to find out.  Also, didn't know if the burger was served with fries.  I ordered the pork benedict.  The pork was inedible.  It was so tough my butter knife would not cut through it.  The potatoes were great though.  My bf said the burger was really good.  The chicken wings were pretty good, but so spendy.  Overall, I will return to this place for the view and some cocktails and skip the food.  I was tempted to try the poutine, but it was $25!"}
{"text":"We didn't eat there, but I agree with others, the Host was extremely awkward and made us feel very uncomfortable.  It's a decent place to hang out by the water and have drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place can't wait for warmer weather to sit on the patio overlooking the river"}
{"text":"Great service from our server Hollywood!   Very friendly and knowledgeable lots of fun!  Great food and Mother loved the homemade chocolate cake!  We would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Attention yelp losers. I know most of you never get out of the house because you live in Madison but if you do give breakwater a try. Great craft beers, great food and a lot of fun. Great happy hour for adults. If you want to go down to State Street and hang out with pimple face kids that's fine but no one's down there for happy hour.  So sick of people reviewing places and saying  they couldn't find  a spot to park, two stars, have you ever been to New York. You can park at Breakwater. On the water fantastic views see you there. Be on TV or Watch it on your couch. It's 5 o'clock somewhere ;)"}
{"text":"I love this location.  Great place to dock the boat, grab some grub, and wet your whistle.  Food selection is amazing now.  Everything tastes great.  Brunch is amazing too!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for birthday lunch today!   Sat on main level deck- beautiful!  There were 5 of us-We all ordered something different!  All was great!   Ryan, our server, was very accommodating and efficient!   We will definitely return!   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My trip to the breakwater was pretty successful and tasty. We went up to the top bar area where it overlooks the channel. It was a gorgeous day and there was a band playing. Great service and good food.   Knocking off 1 star because the prices seem pretty steep for pre made sandwiches and their portion sizes."}
{"text":"New Years eve dinner here was outstanding.  Great choices prepared well with fantastic service."}
{"text":"Came in during a Badger game, no TVs outside so had to sit inside, which was ok I guess..... Although I saw a \"roof top\" Badger tailgate on their FB page, but no one mentioned that one was going on today.  The \"lunch\" menu, as described by the waitress, was for people who like to eat sandwiches...... Which I do, and wanted to do, but they had absolutely no vegetarian options.  Even their cheese curds were made with pork rinds for breading.  I wanted this place to be better than the old one that was here, but with only a few people in this whole place the service was slow and the menu lacked anything for a non-carnivore. Also, I eat a salad everyday, don't wanna pay over $12 for one to eat while dining out.  Totally bummed, but definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The salt & vinegar crusted perch sandwich is amazing!! Very good flavors including the Slaw and mayo."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, the Cuban sandwiches were very good.  Service on the front end was good, but not so much after that.  First drink was slow to come, and to get the waitress for a second one was slow to come.  Now we are done eating, the drinks never came and we r waiting for the bill to go.  Might just be the waitress though...,,"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!!  Service couldn't have been better!  Very professional, friendly, great service!  Their food was a 10!!  I can't wait until summer & we can sit outside!"}
{"text":"I attended a wedding reception at the Breakwater recently and everything was great. The food was the best I've ever experienced at a wedding. The appetizers were extremely varied and tasty. The main courses and the service were wonderful. I'll definitely go back. It was a perfect evening to be on their rooftop terrace."}
{"text":"The ambience was a lil random (see Mary P's 3* review), but I'm usually down for that sort of thing if the food is good. The food was awesome -- the curds and truffle fries were absolutely incredible.  I had a lobster roll, which was my first time trying it. It was real good, maybe a little too salty. After a while, my spirits declined because it started to get soggy and the fries and curds made my mouth super salty, and I was also just a little stressed out because the sports were on really loud and you can hear them from the dining room, so the three things sort of combined to make me a headache. Again, this was not necessarily their fault, but a less salty lobster roll might've helped?   The whole thing was made worth it by the key lime pie. See pictures, it is to die-for.   My only issue with this place (that might prevent me from coming again) was that it was pretty damn expensive for a sort of strange vibe, but the food was dope."}
{"text":"Came here for some apps and drinks. We got the chicken wings and calamari. The wings were mediocre. The calamari was great! I did not like the sauce they had with it though.   We had a specially vodka drink that really hit the spot. It was fruity and exactly what we wanted as we were sitting out on their deck, overlooking the channel.   Their outdoor area is great! It has multiple levels and you can watch the boats coming in and out."}
{"text":"Well... I'm pretty sure this building is haunted or something.  Why?  Cause every business that tries to have success in this location really struggles.  \"I just started 2 weeks ago\". - first thing out of the waiters mouth.  Ugh... it didn't get better from there.  25 minutes for the drinks to arrive at table.  He brought them out one at a time on top of that!   Food took 45-50 minutes to arrive.  Yup you guessed it!  All plates brought out one at a time.  I was finished eating prior to others in our group getting their food.  The food was decent.  Not worth that kind of wait though.  Bill time.  You guess d it!  25 more minutes.  Then when he finally did bring it out the bill was all messed up. It was supposed to be four bills. Once sorted out, he took the cards one at a time (what the hell??) and wasted another 10 minutes of our time.   Don't bother with this place.  (Or the next place and the place after that in this location). Something about this location breeds failure."}
{"text":"We went tonight for the well reviewed Poutine. They no longer serve it. Completely disappointed. I had a burger with Jack Daniels bbq sauce, bacon, and onion straws. \"Truffle\" fries on the side. The burger was ok, nothing special. The fries did not have any truffle flavor at all. They had Old Bay on them, and were served with a side of Old Bay aioli, which was pretty good, but not with truffle fries. The fries were undercooked, and limp. Hubby had the special, Jambalaya with 3 blackened shrimp. I thought it was flavorless, he thought it was ok. All in all, not impressed."}
