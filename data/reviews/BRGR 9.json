{"text":"Went to lunch here with some co-workers during the week.  Service ended up being way too slow for lunch.  Ten minutes before someone took our drink orders after we were sat, another fifteen minutes before our drinks came out, and we didn't get our food until about an hour after we arrived.  I would be more understanding about this if the place hadn't been practically empty and we hadn't told our server we were working.

Ordered a burger cooked medium in a lettuce wrap - it came out well-done on a hamburger bun.  Burger's flavor was so-so.  One would think that a restaurant with \"burger\" in the name would know how to make a decent burger.

On the positive side, they provide large portions at a reasonable price and my co-worker really enjoyed his salad."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  A weird experience.  

I flew into Cleveland at 4 pm.  Talked to a fellow at the hitel who informed me about the warehouse district.  Good call hotel guy, I thought as I began my journey.

Quickly walking over I was greeted warmly.  Everything good so far.  Neat colorful decor to distract from the warehouse ness of the place.  They do it well.

I look at the menu and am happy  after seeing its 1/2 price Wednesday.  Yay.  So I order a double of makers with a buffalo chicken burger and some Cajun fries.  Here's were it all goes meh.

The burger comes out and looks peculiar.  I was of the impression it would be a chicken breast with buffalo sauce on the side.  It was a ground chicken patty formed into a burger, ok...  So I try it.  Not great, nor buffaloey, uh oh.  On to the Cajun fries.  The price was def right $1, over salted but still decent.  

I wanted to like this place but a ground chicken patty that has very little \"buffalo\" taste?  No thanks.  Skip the chicken here."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and it wasn't that busy. I really wanted to like this place so a new place could be added to the lunch cycle. The burger was just okay and the bun tasted old. I also thought it was a little pricey for just a burger (all the sides are a la carte and not reasonably priced either)

The atmosphere was great. It might be a good happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed that I can't give this zero stars. It was TERRIBLE! Most probably won't even believe this story but we arrived and ordered our food.  First they came back and told us they had no fries. After waiting for about 45 minutes I noticed nobody in the restaurant had food I asked the waiter what was going on so he said he was going to check and came back 15 minutes later. After an hour of waiting we found out they ran out of burgers! He said they were going to get more and promised that if we waited it would be worth it and they would cover the cost of our meal. In the mean time I noticed one of my friends was there and started talking to him. He told me they ordered a chicken burger and salmon burger and they were out of those too! After about an hour and a half they brought our food and it was terrible! We ended up all taking about 3 bites out of our burgers and leaving. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!!

It's still new and there are quite a few kinks that need to be worked out (ie. service could be faster, wait staff could be more attentive to customers, and any other complaint listed in other reviews) but all in all BRGR 9 is one of my new favorite restaurants!

The menu is fantastic and the food is incredible.  I split sweet potato tater tots (yummm!!) and ordered a turkey burger and despite being incredibly full I ate the whole thing b/c it was just that good!  They also have an insane selection of beer and alcohol...so drink up!

The place has got a great vibe, too--cool, casual, and chic--that makes everyone feel welcome but VIP-ish at the same time.

I hope they can work out everything that people are complaining about b/c this place is WONDERFUL and has tremendous potential to be one of the hot spots of the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"Came in here on Wednesday for half off burger night. Decor is impressive. Apparently there's a whole back VIP and private dining area that looks fantastic. Service was great, I sat at the bar (it was pretty busy) and got the Sunday Brunch burger with some Cajun fries and a whiskey. Food was delicious and came out pretty fast. The Sunday Brunch was a 1/2 lb burger with bacon, egg and Cajun mayo. Best burger in a long while. Definitely dip everything youre eating in the rosemary ketchup and malt vin sauce. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I realize this place recently opened, so my review is tempered with a grain of salt.

The burgers are large (1/2 lb), juicy, and come in several different creative pairings ( cheeses, sauces, vegetables, etc.) This is what I expected since I'm a longtime fan of the burgers at Heck's Cafe (the owner's other establishment.)

Our table of four wasn't all that impressed with the pickles, but that's somewhat insignificant.

I had an order of cajun fries with the Maui burger.  The fries had plenty of seasoning, and there were plenty of fries for the money.  I just wish they were a  little less soft, a little more towards the crispy side. The burger was perfectly prepared, the condiments and bun weren't overpowering. I didn't need to add anything else, as the seasoning, pineapple, and juiciness of the burger were plenty.

The service was friendly and attentive, although the  kitchen did seem to take a while
to prepare our burgers (understandable at a new establishment.)  The restaurant itself is very clean, but is a bit warm for my taste. 

We will be back again in a few weeks for lunch, to see how things progress."}
{"text":"Service: Slow. Probably a result of their being so new so I can't hold it against them too much. Drinks were never refilled.

Food: The first burger I got was raw. Not just a little pink, but cold slimy raw in the center. The manager however was very apologetic and rushed out another burger that was actually cooked. He also graciously removed my order from the bill. That burger was decent (the BLT, I believe). The seasoning on the cajun fries is very tasty but the fries themselves arrived lukewarm, bordering on cold. The sauces (chipotle ranch and bourbon bbq) were delicious.

I'd like to give this place another shot but I'm going to hold off a couple months so they can work the kinks out."}
{"text":"Ordered the basic burger with fries. Was enough for two people who were not that hungry. The extra fries were disappointing - they were like the ones you make at home. The service was prompt and cheerful."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night with my husband, the place was mostly empty. Our server was rude and very fast to get our order. Our drinks came out 15 minutes after we ordered them, and they were simple jack and coke and draft beer. Burgers were cold. took 30 minutes, get it together. I have no idea how you are surviving"}
{"text":"Only went here once, but my burger came out perfect and there were some additional toppings. It tasted great."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! 

The service we got was actually better than expected, according to other reviews. This makes me think they've gotten into a groove and have the business figured out. But, we sat at the bar, too, so that could have made a difference. I could kind of see how things could get jumbled up in the dining room, because there were servers flitting back and forth and disappearing a lot. Either way, we were satisfied.

The burgers were all really creative and I'm glad we tracked down the old cook from Lion on Lorain. It's a relief simply knowing where to go to get something cooked by him. Delicious! The menu was reminiscent of the creativity that LOL had when he was there. I got the Maui burger and it was PERFECT. It cooked exactly how I ordered it; it was a perfect medium, with great pink savory meat in the center. I guess I should add that it was perfect for me. Others have complained of wrong temperatures on burgers and I typically like mine more rare than well, so a lower temp wouldn't have upset me, whereas something overcooked would have. 

The fries were DELICIOUS. And the sauces! Oh the sauces! We got both fries and sweet potato tots, so we got an assortment of sauces. My boyfriend typically shies away from sauces, so I got to revel in the saucy variety. There was a malt vinegar aioli, which was my absolute favorite. SO GOOD. I didn't have to wait for the vinegar to soak into my fries! YES! The rosemary ketchup was ok. It was a little sugary or something for me. It was just a tad bit off. The other two are slipping my mind right now...chipotle something or other. They were good too, but that vinegar one got me distracted. 

Overall, I definitely want to come back, if not for another great burger, for the appetizers. Dorito crusted fried pickles?! HOLY SNACK HEAVEN. I must come back."}
{"text":"Ok. Good fries. Nice bar. Slow service. Crowded at lunch today."}
{"text":"Better experience this time around.  I ordered some type of burger on Texas Toast (forget the name) but it had pulled pork, cheddar, onion ring, lettuce, etc.  It was so, so good.  Juicy and big flavor.  And the cajun seasoning on the fries was great as usual.  Great bar service and a nice list of seasonals."}
{"text":"I've had BRGR 9 twice and it's been pretty darn delicious both times.

The first time, I ordered a burger to-go via the online eatwarehousedistrict service, which I had a coupon for. When I got to BRGR 9, it seemed like they had completely lost my order. Even though no one else was there and there was a bag sitting right next to the register, it took a good 10+ minutes for them to figure out that yes, that was my basic burger.

This meant that by the time I got my burger home (only one block away), it was a bit on the cold side - but was a really good burger! Whew. I was pretty happy with my lunch, and am willing to chock up the confusion to the fact that this was just when EWD was launched.

I then went back on a Wednesday, for 1/2 price burger night. I stepped up from the basics and got a fire burger - I expected it to be really hot and spicy, but I'd say it was more on the \"medium\" level. The bun got damp pretty quickly from the sauces, but that's fine. I ordered fries and that was a bit too much for me - they'd be good to share with someone else though.

I do think the burgers are a bit expensive if you get them full price, but with weekly half-price Wednesdays, it's easy enough to get them at a discount."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to sit back, eat a great burger, have a reasonably priced drink, and watch a game or two.

The appetizer portion of the menu might look a bit limited, but pretty much everything on there is amazing.  If you don't try the pierogis, you're doing yourself a massive disservice.  They come with a big old slab of butter that just goes perfectly with the sour cream.

All of the burgers I've had there have been fantastic, and really show the creativity of the menu planners and kitchen staff.  The Sunday Brunch and the Big Texas are easily the best, but pretty much everything on the menu would blow away the best burger you think you've ever had.

For dessert, you have to have the ice cream burger.  Vanilla ice cream and strawberry mousse top a brownie sandwiched in between two cookies, with fried dough french fries and a strawberry sauce for dipping/pouring, it's totally worth the inevitable diabetic attack.

The decor there is pleasant and easy on the eye.  Nothing really stands out, which is how it should be.

The wait staff and bartenders are always pleasant, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable about the insanely huge collection of beer and cocktails they have to offer.  The guy behind the bar all three times I've been there, I think his name is Fillipe or something Frenchy like that, is always helpful and on top of things.  Between swallowing the last of my drink and setting the glass on the table, he was always there with a refill for me.

The _only_ downside to this place is the shitty dance music that's playing in the background, but they'll usually turn that off in favor of the Indians game if you ask em.

Totally go to Brgr 9 next time you're downtown.  Nothing salves the pain of losing your shirt at the casino like stuffing your face with some of the best food in the Warehouse district."}
{"text":"Great! Tasty drinks, and a normal portion of fries ;) *I have a carb problem*. I also really loved the rosemary infused Ketchup very nice addition. Great location too very beautiful inside."}
{"text":"Was visiting town for work and a friend and I come downtown on a weekday afternoon after work.  It was about 6 so not too much traffic, and we noticed this place, and it wasn't here when I lived here, I asked if we could try it out.  I am kind of glad I didn't find this place by reading Yelp reviews, because I may have missed out... 

We couldn't find street parking so we went into the lot for a few bucks right next door. 

Had a few beers, and some amazingly good burgers.  Sat by the window and just watched the remaining activity going on downtown.  Probably would be cool to people watch during a game or weekday lunch rush. 

Great, friendly service, did like the fries, and as I said before, a pretty good burger.  I am not a big time burger eater, because I like chicken better, but in this case, I am glad I got a burger here.  

Will surely keep this as an option next time I am in town :)"}
{"text":"When I walked in and saw grass fed beef used in the burgers, I was really looking forward to my meal. The bartender did a great job explaining the menu and beer selections, but the meal did not meet expectations. We got onions on our burgers when the menu did not list them on the burger. The outside top of the bun was buttered so every time you took a bite your hands were covered in grease. Really didn't make any sense. We both ordered our burgers medium. Mine was medium my girlfriend's was medium well. 
The other problem with this restaurant is that they used some of the decor from the last place was there. If you are going to create a new restaurant it's should feel like a new concept. Recycling the decor of the last place is not that great and not good for business. 
With grass fed beef I was hoping I would like it but I probably won't be back. When you walk into a burger place, it's not unreasonable to expect an awesome burger."}
{"text":"First let me say I really want this place to do well, I love the concept and was very excited about it when it opened.  This was my 2nd visit and the first was after they opened so I knew there would be some growing pains.  Unfortunately the experience was the same.  First, the food is really good, it's just the rest that is lacking.  We stopped in for lunch which turned into an hour and a half experience, our food took over half an hour and my burger came out way overcooked.  The servers were clearly overwhelmed as I saw a lot of other tables suffering or walk out.  There was no management to be seen and the poor hostess kept trying to hide in the back, like she knew everyone was upset.  You have a great idea and a good product, please get the execution down."}
{"text":"The food was good, but service was awful.  It took almost 10 minutes to get menus, and we didn't get silverware until after we got our food. The waiter had to go behind the bar and yell out to us what beers were on tap (didn't have them written down), and it took 15 minutes to get our drinks (party of 6). Making it worse is that the place was almost completely empty. I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I will never ever EVER go back to this place! The place was sad looking because considering how big the place was, it was completely empty! Now, i know why...There was a scam about burger date night special but that was several days back although the sign was never taken out  - and they used it to scam people in! For a party of 5, prepare to pay $85 plus tips - for burgers, a basket of onion rings and 4 perogies! You're better off walking down the road to the Chop House for a great meal and a service! The manager/ bartender goes hostile on you if you ever question the prices - the waitress cop out by saying she's new and didn't know that the special sign was never taken down and the sign was still there when we left the place - unapologetic and hides in the back. They took our credit card and said that charges can't be reversed...the clumsy waitress almost poured an entire glass of water to my daughter! What a horrible Cleveland experience! We complained to our concierge back at the hotel about this place - it ruined our whole day, money can't be recuperated, we don't mind spending the money for a wonderful meal but this is so horrible I promise to talk about this dive to everyone I know. Please, I think this place is about to close, that's why they have no trained staff, no trained bartender and they really have no interest in serving people in this industry - the peachy keen, the onion rings, the burgers were all mediocre and bland - why even ask how you want your burger done when it all comes out the same???  was horrible, yuck! The place is so empty, but you can't find any one to serve you - perhaps they are washing dishes at back too? Visitors to Cleveland, beware if this place - go to another restaurant, you're better off spending your $100 somewhere else...."}
{"text":"This is a good burger place! Menu is creative and fun. Beer menu is stellar. I hope this place lasts a long while as the Warehouse District needs some new and inventive places to dine."}
{"text":"Since this place just opened, I'll chalk up the misfortunes to kinks that just need to be worked out.

Went here with a friend for lunch. Was pretty empty, but seemed like a great atmosphere. The decoration was gorgeous. If you removed the tables, it could pass for an upscale club. We ordered the pierogies and the garlic parmesan fries for appetizers. Pierogies were good, a little oily and tough though. We got a plain basket of fries instead of the garlic parm we asked for. Our server, who made the entire experience worthwhile, apologized and returned with the appropriate seasonings on the fries. It was better, but the fries seemed to be covered with a copious amount of butter/oil that settled on the bottom of the basket. Not appetizing. It also made the fries soggy.

Here come the burgers. I absolutely love veggie burgers. I was so excited to try theirs out. We get ours, and both of our veggie burgers were burnt. Our server said they were \"charred\", but this was way past charred where we couldn't even eat the patty. He was more than happy to have the kitchen remake them. They came back perfectly done, and were still great a day later. As an apology, he offered us milkshakes on the house. We were too full, but appreciated the gesture nonetheless. I would come back just because our server (Ryan, I believe) made the experience great."}
{"text":"Great upscale casual burger joint with outdoor seating. First of all, the burgers are pretty huge.  I had the basic burger and my friend got the Clevelander (cheddar and double bacon), but their menu has a huge range of burger options as well as a build-your-own burger . .  there is even a vegan burger! My friend also tried their lobster corndogs, which were basically crabcakes.  

Overall, not the best burgers I have ever had, but it may have Johnny's Little Bar a run for its money - at least amongst those who want a less dive-y burger experience. The service was prompt and very attentive, and the patio seating will be great for the summer months.  I will definitely be back to try more of the burgers, and of course, the milkshakes.  It's a great little addition to the Warehouse district, and best of all - its open till 3am on the weekend AND delivers!  Score."}
{"text":"In the area on vacation to catch an Indians game, we were looking of a family friendly place where we could eat without taking out a second mortgage. Tis seemed to be ideal. 

As far as the vibe goes, they've got it. Cool signage, nice bar and setup inside with a generous selection of beers.  It's the food that disappoints. 

Five of us dining including three teens. Four ordered various burgers, one a grilled cheese. We also ordered the sirracha onion rings, sweet potato tots and fries to share.

Service was generally slow.  It too way too long for food delivery, especially since the place was virtually empty.

They initially brought the sides. The onion rings were excellent, though the sirracha barely detectable in the sauce.  The fries were fresh cut and hot. The tater tots were disappointing, way too sweet, then add a sweet sauce. 

As for the burgers, they delivered those a five minutes later, save one, mine. Clearly it was missed in the order since my dining mates were half done when mine arrived hot off the grill. In fact, mine was the only one cooked as ordered, medium. All of the others tended to medium well.   Even the grilled cheese was bland and sent back to be replaced with a burger. 

There was nothing at all special about the food. If ever back in the area, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been there twice during their half off Wednesdays. My first time here was over half a year ago and the special included all burgers on the menu. Now there is a limited selection on burgers but there are discounted appetizers and drinks as well. 

The first time here, I had the big texas which had pulled pork and onion rings on top of the 1/2 lb patty. It was a very big juicy burger. The onion rings were crunchy and the pulled pork was quite flavorful. 

The last time I was here, I got the BRGR melt, which had caramelized onions, mushrooms and swiss on rye bread. This looks a lot like something you get at Melt. Again the burger was very juicy and the toppings went well with the burger and the bread. The rye was lightly toasted. You may also order fries, cajun fries, sweet potato tots or onion rings with the burger.

Service was average here, it gets a bit busy during the special. Also the last time I was here, the entire restaurant was smoky!"}
{"text":"Burger came out a dirty plate. I would avoid due to cleanliness  and the managers excuse was our burgers are juicy.   I guess I should just ignore the dried white sauce and old food on the plate"}
{"text":"Gosh, I just really am not a BRGR 9 fan. Looking at the menu in advance got my hopes up, but it was a pretty disappointing experience all around.

I tried the Maui burger and the sweet potato tots, and neither of them were as good as I was expecting them to be. I ordered my burger medium and it was basically well done, the pineapple was kind of dry (not sure how that happened), and the sweet potato tots weren't anything to write home about. Maybe this is an issue of me having expectations that were too high, but considering the fact that this place is called \"BRGR 9\" I don't really think it was inappropriate for me to expect an amazing burger.

On top of the mediocre food, our server was a little bit crazy. She spilled the sauces that came with the tots all over the table and only cleaned up about 10% of the mess, and then started telling us about how she was having an off day.. and spent a good three minutes explaining why. She kept trying to talk about her personal life.. I'm not sure if this was a ploy to get me to drink more beer (my third beer choice since they were out of the first two that I tried to order), but if it was, it worked. Definitely one of the weirder server experiences I've had.

Also, there was something off about the smell of this place. It didn't really smell bad, but it didn't smell good.. so I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I picked up a to go order today, and the food was really very good.   I got the Tuscany burger with fries, my husband got the Clevelander and my daughter got chicken fingers.   The Tuscany was really good.  The only criticizm I have is that the balsamic sauce REALLY made the burger, but it was sloppily applied to the bun, so only half of my burger had this great sauce.   I ate the half without sauce first, and it was good, but not really great.   Then when I got to the sauce, I was pleasantly surprised.   My husband enjoyed the Clevelander as well.   We did need to salt everything, but we must just like our food saltier than most, as we end up adding salt to most burgers.
I really liked the ketchup sauce that came with the fries, but neither of us liked the vinegar sauce.   I agree with the other reviewer who said \"Not the best burger on the planet or anything, but they will give Johnny's Little Bar a run for their money.\"  

Bottom line is, we really enjoyed our lunches, and will be back."}
{"text":"Just opened but not doesn't have the kinks out yet. Staff was very friendly but service was slow and not well coordinated. We were there for lunch. My companion ordered chicken fingers, I ordered a BRGR9 with fries. My son's meal came out 15 minutes before my burger, which came out 10 minutes before my fries. It took 3 requests to get a slice of lemon for my iced tea. The chicken fingers were cooked perfectly, but lacked flavor. The burger was excellent, but didn't need the distraction of lettuce or tomato  The fries and dipping sauces(malt vinegar aioli & rosemary ketchup) were worth the wait. This place has potential once they figure out how to smoothly serve their customers."}
{"text":"Bad parking
Good décor
Well made fries
Bland burger 
Ordinary shake

Nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"It's new so i'm hopeful for them - but man, fix your 'asian' coleslaw cause it's not so good. Burgers are though! So that's good news! Grass fed is a bonus. We're in the neighborhood so we'll go back. Eggplant fries are meh - they soak up an awful lot of oil and are kinda limp. Fry up some local seasonal okra! It's great! Trust me! And c'mon guys, get your act together sooner than later. it's just burgers! Wow us! You can do it!"}
{"text":"I think too many times people only review things when they have a bad experience and not enough when they have a positive one. We had a positive one at BRGR9.  We stopped for dinner before a Browns game and were greeted quickly(I believe by one of the owners)

We were seated out on the patio which made for great people watching. They had $2 16oz Bud Light cans on special which was great because these same cans go for $8 in the stadium.  3 of us ordered burgers and one ordered a salad. All of us loved our food. The burgers were cooked perfectly.  Fries were yummy and paired with two dipping sauces: Rosemary ketchup(yum) and malt vinegar aioli(DOUBLE YUM!). 

Prices were VERY fair. If you pay $9 for a burger at Red Robin, you cant complain about the same prices in a downtown eating establishment. And these burgers were better and bigger!

Definitely will be back to BRGR9!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great!  They are creative and delicious. Also, the appetizers are quite good.  The Stickles and Tatertots are our favorites.  If you are looking for something more healthy, they have several very healthy but tasty salads.  Service is usually friendly as well.  Inside is nicely decorated and they have TVs for sports games at the bar.  Despite all of the positives of this place, the service is usually quite slow.  It's definitely a drawback.  if you have enough time, I would definitely recommend going here and getting an \"I Called Fire\" burger or a \"Sunday Brunch\" (with extra cheese of course)!  But if you are in a hurry, hit up another place :)"}
{"text":"good service
awesome shakes
great quality of meat in the burger
cajun fries are nice"}
{"text":"Returned again a week ago for dinner, and finally tried that milkshake. It was delicious but TINY.  Like in the glass you get orange juice at a brunch place. Somewhat disappointing.

I wasn't in a burger mood this time so went for one of the salads which was actually really filling, and good. 

On the more unfortunate side, my boyfriend's burger was mediocre, then actually made him sick by the time we got home. 

I'm not sure I'll be back for burgers here, honestly. Milkshakes, salads, drinks- all great though."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here a few weeks ago after one of them had read an article touting BRGR 9 as a great, new, up-and-coming burger joint in Cleveland.

We stopped early on a weekend night, and the restaurant was fairly empty. However, the hostess was nowhere to be found. We waited at the front for five minutes or so before she finally appeared. She was unfriendly and did not smile, and bitterly walked us to a table outside. This table was very wobbly, even tipping when she set the menu down. I asked her if we could sit at a different table, or (since these were small, light tables) if we could switch this one out for another. She rolled her eyes at me, and then silently switched out our table for another. It turned out that the hostess was our waitress too, and after another long stretch of waiting she took our orders, again quite brusquely and never smiling.

After another inexplicably long wait, we received our burgers. I order the Fire, which was the best out of our three orders, probably because of the bacon jelly gave it a bit more flavor, but was not at all spicy and was average at best. My friends ordered the Cali and the Maui, which both sounded good on the menu, but were totally bland, despite having a lot of toppings. My friend ordered a side of sweet potato tater tots, and unfortunately, she recognized them as the frozen, whole sale store kind.

My biggest complaint about the food here is the fact that all three of us ordered our burgers medium rare, and they all were overcooked! There was barely any pink in any of them, and they were probably medium well. I mean, come on, this is a burger restaurant! You would at the very least expect them to cook your meat to the right temperature!

I definitely won't be coming back here! I would rather spend a lot less on a fast food hamburger than waste my time and money here on mediocre food and rude, slow service! In my opinion, BRGR 9 has to improve a whole lot if it wants to be the next up-and-coming burger restaurant in downtown Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a casual dinner in the Warehouse district. Fun atmosphere with modern decor. Burgers were a tad overcooked and, in my opinion, overpriced. Pretty good taste overall, though. Plenty of seating available on a Saturday evening. Service a bit slower than you'd expect. BRGR 9 is an affordable and pleasant dining choice in the area, and it's nice to support the local business!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything else is average...

Been here a handful of times, both right when they opened and well after. The burgers have always been excellent, just make sure you clarify with your waiter exactly how you want your burger cooked. Medium rare actually means medium rare here (pink all the way through, red center).  The fries are typical fries, but I suggest going with the sweet potato tater tots instead! Fantastic!

Drinks, service and ambiance are all average, but the food more than makes up for it. Prices are fair too.  Service seems attentive but a bit slow.

Overall I definitely recommend. My go too burger is the eastside. The Maui is also delish!"}
{"text":"Good burger. Not a great burger, but a good one. Overpriced a bit hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Friday night, but no need because there was plenty of space. The place looks great inside so I was a little surprised to see how empty it was! 

Ordered the vegan burger with plain fries and shared some of the cajun fries. The cajun fries do have a kick to them after you eat them, but tasty! The vegan burger was one of the mushy mashed vegetables kind, which was okay but nothing that I'd crave.

Will for sure come back some evening though for one of their adult milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger....Not so great. Staff was sort of rude."}
{"text":"Burger odyssey
The quest for the cheeseburger
Where will it be found?

So far, I have had three very different experiences at BRGR9.  Went  about a week or so after the opening, and that was a 2 star experience.  Food took forever, wrong temps on the burgers, service issues etc...etc....  You can chalk that one up to early jitters I suppose.  I gave it a solid month to get it together.  
Came back on a Sunday, for a BLT Burger. Sat at the bar and was nicely taken care of by Marissa.  Or Larissa. Not sure on the name.  The feature is obviously a zillion different kinds of beer, but they do make an attempt at cocktails. Serviceable, but a lot of vodka drinks. Mine was a gin/st.germain/cucumber  combination that was decidedly too sweet, but hey.  I'm picky.  So I'll stick to a cold one next time.  The burger took a half hour to appear, and it really was not busy.  It was cooked perfectly, medium as ordered. The BLT part was the weak link. The tomatoes were about sliced about an eighth of an inch thick and the bacon was not the highlight.  Limp, and an odd whitish color.  Other than that, nice bun and a decent burger. That took a half an hour.
Nonetheless, I was intrigued by one item I saw that I came back the next day.  And that my friends, that item alone is why I write this review, and bump it up to 4 stars. Lunch the next day was again, at the bar, with the same charming Marissa/Larissa. This time my lunch consisted of a wedge salad that was served with a burger patty. Food appeared in just under 15 minutes. A bit on the long side, but still respectable.  Apparently, there is a lot of to-go carry out that goes on during the lunch hour. The salad was fine, but again, really thin tomato slices.  Crispy bacon on top, along with a nice blue cheese dressing. Unfortunately, the beef patty oozed pink juices into the dressing, which was a tad unappetizing, but I'm clueless how to address that issue other than a separate plate.  The menu claims that the beef is Ohio grass fed, and I really hope it is.

And now, here is the winner.  The ringer. Two words folks. \"PIG WINGS\". This appetizer of sliced and deep fried pork shanks with a bacon jam is the tastiest thing on west 9th street.  Of the charts goodness. Tender and tasty pig shanks. Dear god, these just may make my death row dinner request.  So get them.

{"text":"We came across BRGR 9 by accident last night after visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and had wonderful experience!!! We will definitely return! 

The waitstaff was outstanding- from holding the door for us to enter to the manager coming to the table to ensure we had everything we needed, they were pleasant,  welcoming, and professional. They were very helpful with recommendations and we we were very happy with the suggestion we were given for evening entertainment! 

The food is reasonably priced for the quality. We enjoyed the interesting beer/cocktail offerings and the food was excellent. 

The only complaint we had was that my cousin's well done burger came out way later than the rest of our food."}
{"text":"Brgr 9 was great!  Lots of different burger topings and everything I saw appeared to be quality ingreedents.  
The french fries (cajun style) were wonderful - really spicey and when the rosemary ketchup was used it was an unique flavor.
If you are a Clevelander then I would say this - If B Spot is a 10 then this place is a 9.  Like the B spot they use Grass Fed Beef which makes all the difference - the bun was really good as well.  Can't complain and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted to like BRGR9 and the food was good--cold, but good.  I had read previous reviews before we went and knew we might get something great--or not so great; the horrible service is why I won't be back.  

Our host who seated us turned into our waiter out of necessity as the wait staff seemed at times lost, lazy, inexperienced, and apathetic.  To the host's credit, he tried as much as he could (and he made an awesome Nutella shake in his stint as bartender!).  There appeared to be one slow, inattentive waiter.  When he got in the weeds, the bartender came out from behind the bar to help him.  This left a back-up at the bar and everyone was walking quickly around getting nothing done in the process.  Watching the waiter and bartender deal with tables around us, it didn't seem that anyone had waited tables before: no one checked on drink refills, if the food was correct, etc.  Again, I don't blame our waiter because he was just the host, after all. 

When the food finally came out (some 30-40 minutes after ordering) it was good. It also seemed that there was some chaos in the kitchen, or maybe only one cook?  There appeared to be no manager anywhere, something BRGR9 could benefit from greatly.   This was also before a Brown's game so management should have known one waiter would not suffice."}
{"text":"I think BRGR 9 is at least a little bit better than Yelp currently gives it credit for. We dropped in here to get dinner after the Browns game one night and it was nearly empty. The service was great, very prompt and helpful. The interior decoration was a little bit awkward and felt kind of cheap, but it was very clean. They have a pretty excellent beer selection (Great Lakes Christmas Ale all winter!) and they play really good music too.

As far as the food, mine was mostly better than average. I had a Cali Burger, which is a cajun-spiced burger with avocado, corn salsa and pepper jack cheese. The quality of the ingredients was solid, and the burger itself was cooked perfectly (I ordered it medium rare). At a half pound, the portions are a little too huge for my liking, but it was good enough to take home and finish later anyway. The bread was better than average, and the sandwich on the whole was a little on the greasy side, but very tasty.

The menu is pretty varied and they have a lot of options for non-meat-eaters.

The one major disappointment for me was the onion rings, which were really greasy and overly breaded. They have decent milkshakes as well, along with a weird \"dessert burger\"-- the buns are chocolate chip cookies, and the \"burger\" is a brownie. It comes with funnel cake french fries."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a good burger.  

I stopped here first during a browns game to to try some Dorito crusted pickles.  How could those not rock?  We enjoyed them with a few beverages, but the restaurant was definitely lacking something; patrons.  It was a busy Sunday in downtown Cleveland, and while this is slightly off the W6th path, they really needed some more customers.  

Another Tuesday, I wanted to check it out again for a burger.  We were THE ONLY two people in the place, along with the 5 employees.  It just makes you wonder what is wrong with the place, whether they just don't know how to market, location, or their food.  It's not enjoyable to be somewhere (huge place, mind you) all alone.  It has potential, but they gotta get some people in there to survive.  The burgers were good, nothing exciting enough for me to overlook the awkward experience."}
{"text":"I am totally prone to using hyberbole and superlatives when I get excited, especially about food, so here goes:

BEST BURGER EVER!!

I got the Sunday Brunch burger, and it was sooooooo good. It had a runny fried egg and hash browns and aioli on a perfect brioche bun. I didn't try the fries, but my friends all seemed to love theirs. 

I also ordered the Slickles - fried pickles with a crushed Dorito crust...not as awesome as it sounds, and at the price, you'd be happier throwing in a couple more bucks and just getting TWO AMAZING BURGERS. 

The service wasn't awesome; I think maybe it was the guy's first day or something... There were long intermissions between sightings (like 20 minutes before getting drinks - iced tea that came room temperature with no ice), and two friends' orders were totally wrong, but he was friendly enough, and everything got rectified, albeit after more than an hour and a half.... we have a theory that the farther you get away from the center of downtown, the less restaurants seem to know of the concept of a lunch \"hour\"... 

Luckily, it was a beautiful day to sit on their patio, so we didn't mind too much. Also, because the parking situation is terrible, we walked - the long walk back to our office in the Gateway district was the perfect way to start digesting the huge burgers.

Overall, I was definitely happy with my meal, and I can't wait to go back and try the California burger with a veggie patty!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place...I just can't say it's anything special. They do have Half Off Wednesdays on the burgers (beef and chicken), so that makes it \"A-OK\" for me.

I've been here a couple times.  First time was a date, second time was by my lonesome for half off burgers.  I would have rated it 3 stars the first time, but wanted to try another burger and give it a shot.  I did, and it still got 3 stars in my book.

I had the burger topped with corned beef and swiss.  Granted the corned beef was tender (which is key), it was a little bland mostly likely because this isn't their most popular burger.  I had the guacamole burger last time and thought it was a little bland because it wasn't their most popular burger.  Maybe there is a \"most popular\" burger I should try...hint hint please let me know.

The decor is good, the bartender was nice, the music choice was questionable (Mariah Carey and J.Lo), and the menu is huge.  The burgers...just ok."}
{"text":"This place was great. Weird to read some of the reviews that had a polar opposite experience to ours.

We had the sweet potato tots as an appetizer, excellent. My wife got the \"Brgr Melt\" (patty melt) burger, I had the Pinnacle (Reuben on a burger). They were cooked perfectly and were a challenge to finish (huge burgers). I wish I were still eating that burger, I miss it.

The service was excellent, our waters and my beer were kept full without asking. The beer selection was very good, they even had Lagunitas on tap.

If we're ever in town again I would definitely hit this place up!"}
{"text":"We really want to like this resturant since we live in the area. When it first opened the food and service was great. In the past 6 months everything has changed.  The service is average at best and the atmosphere is unfriendly.  I would not recommend this resturant with all of the other good burger places in Cleveland."}
