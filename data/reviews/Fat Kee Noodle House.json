{"text":"If your looking for a place to unwind after days of traveling here it is! Fast service and a lot of items on the menu. They serve excellent great tasting comfort food with hot tea. I found my go to restaurant when traveling to Calgary!"}
{"text":"great food for late nights, we head over after class some nights and even late it is still fresh and good, it is a hidden gem,  dont let the furnishing turn you off the food is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, price is amazing. Always great! We ordered the family size ginger beef, shanghai noodles in black bean sauce, spring rolls and salt and pepper squid. All delicious and price was under $40"}
{"text":"Don't know why people said its noodles good.
Service is good, food is just acceptable."}
{"text":"Ok food. Bad service! I'm not done eating yet and the waitress took my saucer and tea cup. This is not the first time i had a bad service at this restaurant"}
{"text":"It was better before but has gone a bit downhill in terms of the quality of food. The chicken corn soup is kind of bland bit for Chinese food in cowtown this is pretty much it for fast-food. I recommend the wonton soup and the chicken fried rice"}
{"text":"Once of my favorite a Chinese places in Calgary. Very authentic.. but that also includes the service :) staff can be a little short with customers but its very much a authentic Chinese way of food service. 

You wont find your typical deep fried western dishes here. Most dishes are made fresh in a wok with no breading which i love!"}
{"text":"Ordered fried chicken fried rice to go,,,,, it was Labor Day and they were closing in one hour ( trying to give them excuse) but worst I ever had,,, I was really hungry cause it was around 4 and I skipped lunch,,, i ate 1/4 of it to kill hunger pains then thru in trash,,,,, won't be back"}
{"text":"I was expecting much better based on the reviews I'd read; unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by it. When I came in there was no one to tell me to sit wherever I'd like or to seat me or even to ask me \"for here or to go.\" There was only one server so it took quite some time before my order was taken but then only 90 seconds for my food to come out, in which I am always hesitant when food is prepared that quickly. My hesitation proved correct: the food was quite disappointing, the chicken was very thin, slimy looking, didn't look like any chicken I'd ever had and is often an indication of it not being fresh or stored properly, the taste was bland, bell peppers weren't even cooked... it's as though the chicken was cooked, the veggies and sauce were put on top and then everything was tossed into the microwave, hence why it took less than two minutes for me to receive it. Not once was I asked how I liked it, when I was ready to go, I walked up myself to the register to pay and leafy without finishing my food."}
{"text":"Ben here on business trip, food is surprisingly good. I was hesitating due to the number of reviews on yelp , but the food is actually really good. sweet and sour pork is very crispy and fried rice was tasty as well. plan to come here very night this week!"}
{"text":"Try the Salt and Pepper Squid. Crispy and flavourful! Service is fast and friendly, and menu items have  been modified upon request. Brings back good memories of living in China for me."}
{"text":"Came in here by default as we drove across town to hit up Inti Peruvian in the same plaza. Blasted! It was closed for lunch! So, being pretty hungry, we entered into the Noodle House after a quick Yelp check. I won't lie - it was a bit scary going inside. 1 customer, filthy floors, tables not wiped down and 1 server. We just sat ourselves as there is no formal greeting here and after a minute of looking at the menus with bean sprouts all over them, we decided on a take out order. I felt bad about just leaving as the kind server had plopped our tea down almost as soon as we sat down. Decor not much to look at while we waited. I certainly did not want to peek into the kitchen or have to use the washroom. The food did not take too long to come out and the prices were very reasonable.
The won ton soup to me tasted like tinny tap water and the Singapore noodles were just ok - needed another healthy dose of curry in it. And seasoning.
All in all, not the best choice for us."}
{"text":"My buddy has been raving about this little gem for ages. Tonight we walked in - it was completely packed. One woman was serving the entire restaurant, running hard to serve everyone. She was very apologetic about the wait, and friendly despite the obvious chaos. The food was delicious - especially the 3 kinds of seafood with salt and pepper (hot). Light, not greasy, the prawns had a good crunch, and the squid was tender. We ordered a plate of noodles and won ton with white flat noodles. Yummy. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place has quite a lunch following, so arrive early during the lunch hour and avoid having to wait for tables.  This place is tends to be more quiet at dinner time, because of the area.  The food is good for the price and the food comes quick once ordered."}
{"text":"Noodle houses are to the chinese what McDonald's, A&W or Wendy's are to the average North American. It's fast-food but a step up from hamburger and fries. It's not fabulous chinese food but it's good and hot and there's a great selection of what you can get. Noodles or rice with different kinds of toppings and meat. I generally go there for lo mein which is basically boiled noodles served with your selection of meat, some veggies and the broth on the side. Today I had a craving for crispy noodles so I ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein. Cantonese Chow Mein is generally noodles fried in the wok till the edges of the portion of noodles is crisp, placed on a plate, the meats and vegetables prepared with a bit of sauce and then poured on top of the crispy noodles and served. By edges I mean think of the portion of noodles like a big pancake so each noodle will have some crispy portions, some soft when fried. This is the normal cantonese chow mein that I grew up having. I was a bit disappointed because they have taken a short cut and opted to deep fry the noodles so the result is that it is a mass of crispy noodles; deep frying the whole lot totally changes things. It was ok but not the same. There was the usual mix of shrimp, barbeque pork, chicken and vegetables stir fried with a sauce and poured over the noodles. My photo has some hot chili oil added to the top. Decent cheap eats. Cost was just over $8 for the dish."}
{"text":"After some shopping/browsing at Cross Iron Mills, we wanted to grab a bite to eat for dinner Saturday evening. I was excited to finally try Basil but being ever so lucky, we went and it was closed! Completely shuttered down so I'm not sure if they were on vacation or just randomly closed for Sept long weekend. We weren't worried because this area is loaded with good eats. I remembered a new ramen place, Ramen Ichinen, had just opened so I thought it was meant to be. It wasn't.

Never a good sign when you see an old lady, chaining smoking in her car telling you that this place is legit. Moral of story: never trust crusty old ladies.

There was a bunch of restaurants in this plaza area, including Inti - Modern Peruvian, Sahana's Sri Lankan and South Indian Fusion (Sri Lankan!!) and a couple others. My parents spotted Fat Kee Noodle House and they were instantly sold on the sign proudly claiming fresh noodles.

We didn't realize until after we ordered but there were so many specials. Make sure you take a look! I regret not seeing this (of course, the sole waitress didn't bother to mention it) earlier because I would have been all over that eggplant special.

The menu is typical Chinese style with your usual 147 items. In case you didn't have enough options, you know?

- Ginger fried squid (#40) ($13.95) - I wasn't expecting the squid to be battered like this but the parents seemed to like it. I thought the sauce was way too sweet. It tasted similar to that fake sweet and sour sauce you get with Canadianized Chinese food. Meh.

- Foo geen chow mein (#73) ($11.95) - pretty standard chow main with a variety of different meats. This one was quite saucy.

- Szechuan style Shanghai fine noodle soup (#129) ($7.50) - Szechuan style usually means spicy/fiery right? Not in this bowl. Broth was pretty weak/plain but for the price, I guess you can't complain too much. Wasn't impressed with the noodles either.

- Tossed noodles with dumplings (#132) ($8.50) - this was my favourite out of the four dishes we ordered. Simple, traditional cooking. It comes with a side of soup that you can use to dip your noodles in. Liked these noodles much more - nice bite and went down smoothly.

Overall, Fat Kee was decent but nothing to write home about. The good? We put in our order and dishes literally came out in under 10 minutes. They are fast. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. It is what it is: late night, cheap Chinese food."}
{"text":"Fat kee has been one of those hole-in-a-wall places in the NE. I have been coming here for years and I'm sure they have gone through many different owners cuz or at least lots of different servers throughout the years but the food has not changed.

Prices are great as its in the NE and the food quality is great as well. I really like all their brisket dishes like the soup with egg noodle or just on rice with book choy. Yum! 

Service is not that great but the food is consistent. Cheap, quick eats!"}
{"text":"Fat Kee Noodle House is one of many hidden gems in the city's North East. You can complain about the NE all you want, but it has the souless, chain-ridden NW and SW beat for places to eat.

Fat Kee is in a strip mall across from a truck stop in an industrial area and is mostly industrial looking itself.

By that I mean the furniture and decor are functional versus stylish (green vinyl chairs, panoramic photos of Calgary's 1989 skyline) and it's not a place to take anyone who judges a restaurant by it's decor.

For those of us who are more interested in food than furniture, Fat Kee has a huge menu of delicious chinese dishes. There's always at least 4 ever changing specials as well as appetizers, try the green onion cakes. 

The food here is super cheap (usually less than $12 per plate), fresh, and tasty. They do not shy away from flavours here. I can't say I've had everything on the menu, but I have sampled a little of everything. 

Everything from the meat to seafood and the vegetable dishes are great. On that note, there's also some options for vegetarians on the menu as well.

The food also comes fast. I don't know how they do it, but I've had my food arrive in less than 10 minutes almost every single time.

The only thing to keep in mind is they only accept cash and credit cards and the waitresses get upset if you refuse to take your leftovers home. I can't blame them, I hate wasting food.

If you're looking for a unique spot for lunch or dinner in the NE, check out Fat Kee. As an added plus it's also close to the airport so you can have a great chinese meal before take-off or after landing."}
{"text":"The price is decent and food quality is acceptable as of chinese food in town or at least the northeast area. At least it's close to my hotel in walking distance so nothing to complain about. 

Ordered a few times there, 1) Cantonese chow mien 2) bitter melon & beef in black bean sauce in bed of rice 3) wonton noodle soup. Not too bad but didn't wow me at all. 

If I stay at the same hotel again, I will go back for cheap food and convenient."}
{"text":"Maybe it's okay for others but it really was the worst noodles restaurant I've been too. This place looks so outdated chopsticks were sticky.  As well the menu don't even have picture to visualize what I am going to get. I ordered a Sichuan spicy noodle soups, sounds spicy and hot! When it came out omg, there's mince eggplant and filled with mince garlic and a spicy oil which is not even spicy at all. I literally just took a sip paid my bill and left. Thinking about that noodle soup  was just nasty it was a nightmare!"}
{"text":"You've seen the greasy spoons in Calgary, now see one that's an awful lot like one in HK.  It ain't much to look at admittedly.  It's in a really weird shopping mall, the same one as Inti strangely enough.  It's in an area that never seems to believe in sunlight (so probably a great place to dine if you're a vampire... I meant the food, not the diners!).  But inside these walls, the faded pictures of it's dishes, the many yellowed and curled copies of John Gilchrist's reviews and so on, lies a pretty darn good noodle house.  

This is probably the singlemost authentic cantonese comfort food place I know in this city.  Noodles in all it's forms are celebrate here, whether it be thick or thin, rice or wheat, fried or in a soup and so on.  And to match it all, some pretty awesomely well done congee, nicely salted, has just enough pork or fish or seafood or whatever depending on the style you chose.   Add the fried chinese donut, freshly made, and the meal becomes a time of absolute complete, and total peace (even though surrounded by hungry noisy diners).

They don't have delivery, but they do have pick up, and even encourage it by offering a discount if you pay cash (10% off) or credit card (5%).  However this is also my single pet peeve with them, as they often forget to offer the discount, so you do have to remind them of it.  

Still, it's just simple good food.  Northing unassuming, nothing fancy, but filling, hearty and absolutely yummy.  

Special tip: for a few extra bucks, you can get the noodles or rice dishes \"family sized\".  It's well worth the cost!

#2 UPDATE OF EARLIER REVIEW of Yelp's 30-day Review Challenge"}
{"text":"It's good ole' dirty Chinese and boy do I like my food and restaurants real sometimes. And when I say dirty, this is not a bad thing. Dirty means real. I mean old school Wu Tang Clan, Old Dirty Ba$terd kind of dirty. From the outside the pictures of food are weathered; you might feel apprehensive. 

But inside, you've got a bustling little China market lunch shop, with an aproned woman and her bent helper, passing her vegetables, swishing the wok, plating quickly. 

I was in a good mood today, it was my last day at work in the North East before heading to my new job in the south, and I'm a south girl. Unfortunately, in Calgary things are neater in the south. They are more proper. So I celebrated today by coming to Fat Kee and getting a taste of real ethnic deliciousness. 

The food came out fast, probably no more than three minutes after ordering. I'd asked for the lunch special, beef and mushroom over steamed rice, but when I saw the menu and realized I'd rather have noodles, I tried to cancel my order but instead she came back with a piping hot dish of my lunch special. I asked for hot sauce. Done. I had already been given a piping hot pot of loose leaf green tea. I ate. Wished they hadn't held me to my order. I looked at what others had ordered, I felt twangs of jealousy. I ate more. 

Before I knew it, I'd finished the whole plate. Sure I threw away some pieces of beef that weren't suitable for my Princess/South/Royal mouth, bad bites into paper napkins. Next time I'll stick to seafood or vegetarian stuff. I saw Honda mechanics arrive to a table of heaping steaming fried rice, rice noodles, something else delicious. It wasn't their first Fat Kee. These were repeat customers. 

I noticed the three waitresses welcoming patrons by name. Again, the regulars knew to avoid the lunch rush, another mistake I think I'd made, arriving at 12:15 on a Friday. Would I come back? Yes. Most definitely. You come here with the one who already knows you, who you want to get down and eat with, have real talk, not in your best dress and the 30-minute heels, but a hoodie and kiks."}
{"text":"It's ok. Typical Chinese food. The menu is kind of limited. This is a bare bones kind of place if you don't mind no decor and text only menu. You really have to know what you want. The Shanghai noodles tasted great and the congee was excellent. Their famous chicken dish is pretty good, a tiny bit on the dry side.  Probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Finally, I found a real Chinese noodle joint in Calgary. I was SO happy that I did, as my default comfort food is Chinese noodles (generally Singapore-style rice noodle), and Calgary has been bereft of genuine noodle houses in my time here.

As others have mentioned, noodle houses are to be viewed as fast food, at fast food prices - and Fat Kee nails it on both counts. You get a great plate of noodles served with tea for as little as a Big Mac meal, often delivered as quickly - and it tastes so much better!

I have had better, but Fat Kee is usually very good. The inconsistency that shows in the occasional plate only being \"okay\" loses them their 5th star here.

The service is prompt if a bit brusque - hey, they're busy. And the decor makes you wish there was something to look at out the window - but what do you want when lunch is under $10?"}
