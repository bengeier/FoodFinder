{"text":"Been going there off and on for many years. Breakfast is always good, with lots of coffee fillups, friendly service, and cost-effective.

It's basically comfort food at reasonable prices. The lunch and dinner specials are pretty good, and consistent.

If you head out for breakfast on the weekend, expect to wait, it gets super busy.

{"text":"Good food, nice portions, really friendly staff! The old man (pardon me) is a great waiter, but apparently is retiring soon!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people keep eating here. The food is greasy and tasteless and the service is laughable. I should also add, that the last time I ate there I ended up with food poisoning. Do yourself a favor and eat at home."}
{"text":"This was a great spot.  Ate dinner here on a Monday and enjoyed Kids eat free.  The menu is big with lots of options.  There were many specials on the menu with reduced prices.  We enjoyed the souvlaki dinner and baklava for dessert.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Fickle Pickle, what can you say? It's probably been a long-time Stouffville favourite! It's on Main Street, Stouffville, right in the heart of the downtown area.

Went for brunch on a Friday, there were 4 adults and 3 kids. I thought it wouldn't be a problem to seat us all and I was right! Not many people I guess go for brunch at 11am on a Friday, but it was just a normal Friday, not a holiday so maybe that's why.

So, because we were 7 people there were many orders that I don't quite remember. I think someone had the \"Breakfast Slam\" if that is what it's really called and I think as well someone ordered the eggs benedict. A favourite was the fried pickle. It's plate of 2-3 pickles that have been quartered, battered in a crumb like battered and fried until its nice and golden. I greek omelet, it was a pretty good size. If I remember correctly, it was a 3-egg omelet! I got free coffee with the order and the wait-staff came by regularly to refill our cups. My one niece ordered blueberry pancakes, but from what I could tell from across the table was that they were plain pancakes with blueberry sauce on it. Regardless she was happy with it. I think overall it cost use about $70-80 including the tax and tip to feed all 7 of us, so pretty reasonable.

The interior is a typical small town restaurant/diner with pictures that are probably representative of the owner. There is plenty of street parking in Stouffville, and that includes in front of the restaurant iso it's easy to bring family for a meal."}
{"text":"The best small town diner cardiac paddle breakfast anywhere. Food is delicious and the service friendly. It's crowded on weekend mornings but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ok I'm sure someone isn't going to like this LOL! This place was ok... Not sure what all the hype is about! Found the food greasy and the staff a bit rude! Def not my fav place to eat in town."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place. Just your basic greasy spoon with good food and not too expensive. The service is quick (which is great because they will be really busy on a Saturday morning), and the owner goes around and makes sure everyone is taken care of."}
{"text":"Great small town diner. Good breakfast, Great sandwiches. Reasonable prices, good service. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Love when we go for Sunday breakfasts here YUM blt with a fried egg .... Can't go wrong. Always consistent with their food and the service is great ."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good that I am willing to drive 40 KMs twice a month to have my brunch there. Highly recommend it. Try their Pickle Slam Breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was good, but decor in serious need of an update.  Had the chicken souvlaki pita with a Greek salad.  Tasted good and was fresh but pricy at $13.  Service was fast.  Seems to be a local favourite among seniors ."}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict on a sunny Saturday morning. When we got there, the restaurant wasn't too busy so we were seated quickly and our service was quick. We found this place initially because we thought Red Bulb did brunches but nothing hot like what we were looking for. 

The food was decent - I found the pea meal bacon super sweet which threw me off. I couldn't taste the hollandaise sauce despite an overload of it on my eggs benedict. The potatoes were good - no complaints. Not sure if I'd come back to this place simply because I am rarely up in Stoufville and if I am, I would prefer to try different coffee places as there was an abundance to choose from on Main St."}
{"text":"On the way to the Stoufville Country Market, we decided to stop here for breakfast.  The breakfast foods were typical and nothing to write home about.  The prices were very high.  My breakfast of 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon, 1 ham, home fries and toast was $10!  We went at 8am and there were no early bird specials!  Bottomless coffee was also included in the breakfast, except it was almost impossible to hunt down our server to get refills.  We were only able to get 1 refill during the time we were there!  This was a very typical breakfast and it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Went with friends and ordered poutine and chicken fingers (the simplest meal), and it was horrible - barely finished it. Good project for 'restaurant impossible'"}
{"text":"We found this place during our mini road trip and enjoyed a nice breakfast. Really good atmosphere and friendly staff. The place was absolutely packed and I'm sure the dinner service is just as good, it has a different special everyday. It's better than Cora's breakfast and more reasonably priced too. Would come again if we passed by. Full of locals. Owner is a nice old man. 

Side note: restrooms are dirty but that's not what you're here for is it."}
{"text":"We just ate here again thought it would be different nope I got sick -_- it's the bacon they use"}
{"text":"Whenever someone asks me whats a good place to get food in stouffville, one of my first recommendations is the Fickle Pickle. The portions are huge and the food tastes great. The cheesesteak sandwich is my 'go to'."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my husband, his cousin, and his wife. It was actually our second time to go there. First time we went there almost a year ago. That time, the experience was very good, because the food was good and the portion huge. I ordered Leg of Lamb which the size was almost half of my head and it came with a tasty mint jelly as a sauce. The lamb was juicy and the memory was amazing. Me and my husband has been craving for the lamb, but was unable to go there again due to our far distance. 

Finally yesterday we had opportunity to go there again, but this time, it was little disappointing. There were no lamb and according the server, it was only available for promotional time. Well, because we were already there, might as well give it a try for their other dishes. 

They usually write their specials on the blackboard hang on walls and that's the place we usually start looking for our food options.

This time I ordered one of their specials: Pot Roast Beef which came with soup of the day, which was too salty. The portion size was greatly reduced and the side of roasted potatoes was too soft and watery. there were only two small slices of roast beef. Compared to the lamb we had, the meat portion was less. I also ordered chocolate milk shake, but the milk shake was not thick and the ice cream was melted to become watery at the half way of the dinner.

My husband ordered two pounds of chicken wings with fries and the wings just tasted like a regular wing, not too special.

I really hope they could go back to their previous quality and portions or at least have better roasted potatoes and little more meat."}
{"text":"Had to be in Stouffville for the morning and decided to pop in to try their breakfast. 

To be honest, this is your standard run of the mill diner. Previously frozen sausages, small eggs, Demptsers bread and OK home fries. 

There's really nothing to write home about. It's a perfectly good breakfast at a reasonable price if you're not looking for something impressive. 

Service was courteous, fast and what you'd expect. 

Quality of food was alright. 

Overall a solid 3 stars. Don't expect to have your socks blown off - but that's not what they advertise but a little effort would be nice."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to enjoy delicious Greek food. The serving sizes are so large and our party enjoyed a variety of delicious Greek Dinners. I use to live in Kato Patisia Athens Greece, and the Mousaka was just like something found on my Kato Patisia streets."}
{"text":"We just came home from the fickle pickle... notice that we came home and didn't eat...  The restaurant seated us at a table then made us wait with our 4 month old for 15-20 minutes before serving us at all.  

When they finally took our order souvlaki and steak sandwich the server  brought my salad and then 20-30 minutes later we noticed our food under the beat lamp.  then it sat there for another 10 minutes drying the pork to inedible cubes.

True it was close to closing time and having worked in a restaurant myself I understand cleaning up and prepping for the next day (BTW you aren't supposed to leave cutlery and plates on tables overnight.). But ignoring customers letting their food get ruined under the heat lamp  lead to them walking out.  And another tip as a waiter don't complain about someone leaving and not paying if you wouldn't eat it at home or worse asking me to pay and take it with me.  You can take out your own refuse I'm not paying to take it with me."}
{"text":"Have to say this place is excellent.. Basically a good old fashioned family restaurant with nice staff, tasty food and good prices. Definately will go back..oh wait..already have!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a diner still around. Food was good and comforting. Definitely a good spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great early breakfast restaurant since they are open by 7am. Typical greasy spoon breakfast of eggs/sausage/bacon/toast/homefries. Would have liked to see more fresh fruit on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places to go for weekend brunch or casual dinner. 
The quality and portion have decreased over the year. It's still a decent place if you want a casual meal or too lazy to cook. 
This visit, my hubby had the 5 oz steak which came with sauteed mushrooms, garlic bread, potato of your choice, and steamed veggies for $17. This is good value; not the best steak but its very fair for the price they charged. Mushroom was sauteed with garlic and butter, delish. Steamed veggies were too boring and a bit soggy.
I had the pot roast (feature menu for the night). It came with potato of choice, soup and steamed veggies for only $14. It was okay; good value.

Overall, price is fair. Service is friendly. Food quality is okay to good."}
