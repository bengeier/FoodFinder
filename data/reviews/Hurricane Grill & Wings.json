{"text":"My first visit there was not a good one. The service was very slow. My sister and I got the lunch special, which was the boneless wings, and i swear Tyson's wings, which come in a bag, are much better.   I was hoping it was just a fluke and decided to give it another try. So later the same week I took my family there for dinner. I wasn't busy at all, yet the service was still incredibly slow. We were there for almost 2 hours. It took roughly 45 mins for us to even get our food. Again, the food was nothing to write home about. I spent $11 on a salad, which would would have been fine if it was actually half decent. Sadly, the $3 Walmart salad kits that come in a bag are a heck of a lot better.   I would not recommend this establishment to anyone, to be completely honest, nor will I be giving it another chance."}
{"text":"Been in numerous times and have to say this place has gotten much better with staff and food!  We usually sit at the bar and Jason is more often than not our bartender.  He is AWESOME!!  Knows what we want to drink as soon as we start walking up to the bar.  He is now the new manager and it shows in the place.  The wings are the biggest I've ever eaten and flavor has gotten better and better.  The layout is great and I cant wait for football season to start, TV's in every direction!  If you tried the place in the past and had problems I hope this helps with giving it another try!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, no music or sound on the TVs, after I asked for the second time some music was turned on, some sort of low sounding reggae I think, could barely hear it. No food on the happy hour menu, $3 Cuba Libra's, I enjoyed those. Didn't sample the food. Might come back not sure yet."}
{"text":"At a $1 a piece for wings way too pricey for very small wings, good service but wouldn't try the wings again"}
{"text":"I stopped by today with my family and my friends. We were greeted by a young lady then sat by a nice young man. We sat down and our waitress took our drink order. Few minutes later the other half of our party showed up. I just want to say overall the food was amazing. Props to the cooks but the service..... The service was horrible. Myself as a waitress, it's important to make sure your guest are happy. First off, I had ordered extra hot sauce for my wings. She passed by twice and never got the sauce almost done with the wings she says \" oh I'll be right back with the sauce\" I said no it's fine. We ordered our food and I had to ask for a refill... She was no where to be found. Finally she was around our table and I asked. Thru out our visit I felt she was speaking with a tone that wasn't pleasant. My friend also done with her drink waited about 10 minutes. our babies were getting fussy so we were attempting to leave. Waiting while she's over at the other end of the restaurant talking her life away. I finally decided to go to a manger and tell him about our horrible visit. I do not remember her name but if there's a next time that we go visit I would not like to have her as our waitress."}
{"text":"They used to be good but lately are over cooking everything. Wings are very dry.  Service is great but too expensive for the type of eatery that it is."}
{"text":"My local Heavenly hangout.  With UFC, Football, and wonderful staffing makes Hurricane the ish!!.  Alex, Dan, and the whole crew at Stephanie and Warm springs are not only friendly but make sure that everything is legit and a fun environment. You can mix and match flavors. Try a one of their 3 dry rubs and any sauce that sounds good with it. Habenaro mixed with Thai Ginger is amazing....Hab mixed with Teriyaki is amazing.. Hab mixed with Burbon apple is amazing.... You get where im going.  Burgers are great, and grilled chicken swch, and shrimp are good as well...  The 2 for 1 specials on beer are cool. I wish they had NEWCASTLE ON TAP!!! Wish they had a BIGGER BAR instead of 5 seats that are extremely uncomfortable.  But.. I love the place. And will continue to devour those delicious wings.  Please go back to your old big wings!! screw the tiny buffalo wings.  For anyone who hasnt gone.. GO already!! 31 flavors? pssshh!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere with country music...i don't get it.This is a tropical setting. We were there for lunch and the service was slower than slow. Half hour later we got our food and it was good. The bar tender..Wendy went out of her way to wait on tables. The mgr needs to show up for work and chip in. I want to give it another try. Only because the of the food."}
{"text":"My first visit was for lunch with co-workers.  The service was courteous and prompt.  Food was OK for a chain.  My second visit was a total nightmare.  First we were seated at a table with freezing air blowing down on us, which required us to be moved.  Took 45 minutes for drinks and appetizer.  During that time there were numerous occasions when drinks and food were brought to our table which we did not order.  Approximately one hour for entrees.  One item ordered was grilled chicken breast with jerk seasoning, garlic and parmesan broccoli and yellow rice.  What was delivered was some type of wrap which was then replaced with the 'correct' item.  This 'correct' item was a chicken breast with the texture of a sponge.  And a cold sponge at that.  There was no seasoning of any kind (what happened to the jerk) and the grill marks looked fake.  The cold broccoli had neither garlic or parmesan and the rice was tepid.  During this whole time the waitress kept repeating \"your food (or drinks) will be up shortly\".  Obviously she does not understand the meaning of shortly.  At one point I asked her \"are you sure\" and she responded with \"did you want me to check?\"  REALLY?  I was advised my meal would be comped since it was inedible and took over an hour.  What I received was three $5 off coupons.  When they were presented to the waitress when she was ringing up the bill they were not used.  So the comp requires another visit.  ARE YOU CRAZY?  Oh, and I forgot, it was SO loud in there one needed to yell to have any kind of conversation with the other diners at the table.  The four or five previous restaurants which inhabited this space all failed for various reasons.  I can predict the same thing will happen to this establishment.  It's not worth the deep-fried pickles."}
{"text":"Great potential, been here twice and both times i have had to make someone take our order.. Food is pretty good and beer is great"}
{"text":"Really I came in with the word partner for Veterans Day being a vet hurricane real gave me a free entree and non-alcoholic beverage and I love the wings the sauce was delicious the wings were large.  Really enjoyed the service and how they treated us vets. I will  be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the hurricane grill in surprise and it was the worst meal I've ever had in my life ordered the fish and chips the breading on the fish was as hard as a rock and full of grease the fish inside was about 3/8 of an inch thick and tasted like fish it was not cod it must have been another type of finish the french fries   Absolutely a terrible meal."}
{"text":"Best wings in Surprise. I miss Buffalo Wild Wings but this place does have more of a selection of wings."}
{"text":"Heads up just don't even try it. That was awful. Both food and service. 5 servers for 1 table.  40 minutes before we got our food watched a large group walk out before their their correct order of drink came out and watched the manager run out after them to apologize."}
{"text":"Wow. Best food in the valley and served by the best bartenders anywhere.  I would use the term bar food but am reluctant because it is better then most casual dining restaurants in the valley.  Always feel welcomed.  The wings and beef are never frozen and the wings are the best I have ever had. Tons of TV's to watch your favorite team. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food choices are uninviting, the family and I came for dinner. Ordered a beer and the waiter brought me a flat beer that looked like urine. The food we ordered, the chicken wraps, veggie burger with avocado,  and the garlic steak. First off, the chicken lettuce wraps tasted like pre-packaged chicken meat mixed with dried cranberries of some sort. The chicken was not freshly made to order. Second, the veggie burger tasted like mystery meat and frozen. The waitress forgot the guacamole for my burger and brought it as a side. The guacamole tasted like wholly guacamole that you buy at the store. The ingredients were not fresh and tasteless. The garlic steak was surprisingly fair to eat but this place is definitely not a steak joint. The natural cut fries that were a side dish did not taste freshly made and looked burnt but felt cold to eat; this was odd. I don't want to be too negative but when it comes to food I expect to get what I pay for ($9-11 a plate). Instead, I received frozen ready to make food that I could have made at home for half the cost of my plate."}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here a ton during football season... They get super crowded, but still have great service. The wings are fantastic and the garlic Parmesan fries are to die for! The beer is a bit pricey but the food makes up for it. I love trivia Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Great food today. It was our first time eating here, but now we wonder why. They were super busy, which slowed the delivery of the food, but the wait was well worth the wait.  Make sure you try the BBQ pulled pork quesadilla."}
{"text":"Worst.......restaraunt........ever!!! Got dragged here a couple of times by a group of friends.the hostesses were nice and friendly,the decor was laid back,the food and service was just awful though.the beer tastes like it came out of dirty taps.it was skunky and gross.waited 15 mins.for server to waddle over to us.she mustve thought she was hot stuff because she had on a really short skirt and was about oh....60 lbs.overweight.gross!good if your on a diet I guess.she acted like it was a privelage to be served by her.as she was too busy talking to co workers in the middle of taking our order.the food was greasy and mediocre.the grilled chicken tastes frozen and is full of fillers.my friend said the wings were good though.the cliental consists of loud, drunk,demanding old people.we got stuck next to a group of like 10 of them and everytime any server walked by they demanded something loudly and rudely.I was shocked to see that every server dropped what they were doing to cater to these gereatrics.it really affected our service along with other peoples who were sitting near us.then later that night they had live music.it was just some stuck up hipster with an acoustic playing the same tired old cover songs we've all heard a million times before,mixed with his desperate need for attention by chatting up the drunks at the bar loudly over the microphone.the music/cries for attention were soooo loud we couldn't even carry on a conversation without screaming at each other.the whole scene was just annoying."}
{"text":"I will give two stars because the food is great!  We really enjoy the food and it always taste so good and is hot and fresh.  However, the manager there is rude and obnoxious.  We went for the ABC15 promotion of 50% off your bill.  We were over charged for our drink and appetizer based on the menu price and what the waitress quoted us.  When asked to honor the price that was given and published, we were given attitude and nobody would take responsibility for the misrepresentation.  When I challenged the discount that was given because it did not include the price adjustment as they stated it did (yes, I check my receipts and calculate everything to make sure we are charged what we are supposed t be) the manager asked \" well what do you want me to do\", I told him to honor the price that the waitress quoted and is published in your menu.  He took the receipt and changed the discount amount to reflect the correct pricing.  When he came back he slammed down the book and said \"here is your $25 of free food\" and walked away.  As we were leaving he actually came out of the restaurant and started yelling at us across the parking lot about our free food and hope we enjoyed all our free food, etc.  I could not believe the level of unprofessionalism by a manager and to actually come out of the restaurant and yell at us in front of other customers was absolutely horrifying. It's not like we were trying to cheap out, just asking for the rightful price that was given.  If your staff cannot remember correct pricing, then you should honor the pricing they give."}
{"text":"Love the wings  and especially hurricane rice. cold beers------- love love love it. Easy going place to hang out. Just normal people nothing like scottsdale :)"}
{"text":"If I could give negative I would- don't waste your time reading the reviews just DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times a while back it was good.  Today,  garlic parm fries were submerged in oil/butter and a bit under cooked.  Mahi, chicken, shrimp and pulled pork were dry and overcooked. Service was very slow and the place was empty.  So long Hurricane grill."}
{"text":"We have been going here since moving to Surprise a few years ago, but we won't ever be going back. My husband & I always order the same things: a burger for him & blackened mahi tacos for me. They really screwed it up this time. He asked the server, as he does every time, if they can cook the burger rare. The server said yes, but it came out medium-well. My fish tacos came absolutely flooded in sauce. It looked like soup! I used a pile of napkins to try to mop it up; I still couldn't taste the tiny pieces of fish. The server told me when he brought them that mahi tacos were no longer on the menu, but they made them for me anyway. So I'm guessing someone was mad & wanted to make sure that I never order them again. And he never asked us how are food was, even though he asked the table right behind us. It seemed like he knew it was messed up. We wish that we would have walked away once we saw our meals, saved the money, & gone to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Our family came here on a Sunday for lunch and we left with a knawing feeling of disgust!! My husband ordered a beer, that the waitress forgot about and  was never brought out to him. The wings were practically flavorless and had soggy skin! (Not to mention they were ridiculously overpriced) I ordered a hamburger that upon arrival, looked decent- I was wrong!  It was flavorless and the meat tasted freezer burnt- the fries were nothing I can't find in the freezer section at my local grocery store. Needless to say, we will not be coming back to this place. Worst $40 spent; we should have gone to Whataburger across the street, their burgers are better by a long shot!"}
{"text":"What I ordered: 10 Wings- Maple pepper (5) & Mild Buffalo (5)  My experience is inline with the other 1 and 2 star reviews on this site.   -Staff was generally rude/ lacking in any professionalism (except for my server, who was polite when dealing directly with me).  -Wings were TERRIBLE....really dry/ overcooked. -The \"sauce/glaze\" was watery and lack any flavor  -The decor/ beach theme looked fun but was overshadowed by all the other negatives.  *** I complained to the manager about the wings being less then desirable. The Manager told me that \"if I was going to complain about the food then please do not come back.\"  WOW! What kind of customer service is that?????? Pretty much sums up the whole experience.******  -I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HURRICANE GRILL & WINGS.... and I suggest that you do yourself a favor and skip this place altogether!  -Overall I would love to see this place and the management staff get torn apart on a Food Network \"fix my restaurant show!\""}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst I have tried in a good while. I arrived and I liked the decor of this place, it had a beach theme inside. Once I was seated it all went down the drain. My server was a girl named Ashleigh who did not tell me anything about the menu but I was there during wing night ( they increased the price of the wings from .40 to .60 along with a .75 up charge for ranch or blu cheese ) but I still wanted to try them. I overheard another waitress mention they had certain appetizers on special during happy hour so I was not happy that my waitress omitted telling me that. I ordered an order of loco coco (habanero and coconut) and chipotle raspberry wingless. Once they arrived i was extremely disappointed, they were heavily breaded with no flavor. I couldn't get a refill to save my life until about 20 minutes when my wings came out, she did apologize and brought me a refill along with the check. I was ready to pay and even then it took almost 20 minutes for her to come pick up the check which she didn't do, I had to flag another waitress to get her to cash me out. Thank god I didn't order a big meal here. Even spending $10 at this place stings but it's not bad considering they up charge for a lot of things.   Horrible food, horrible service, If this place last 6 months I will be amazed."}
{"text":"So the place looks like Hooters threw up on Joe's crab shack...that aside I gave this place a fair chance and was happy I did.  As an avid sports fan there are tv's everywhere in this place great when watching final four games. Our waitress was honest with her recommendations (fish and chips and this drink called Adams Apple -angry balls and Sam Adams)   Food was hot and cooked perfectly. I ordered an item that I thought would come out tasty...at first I was going to order the steak currasco and decided that would probably be a bad idea  Only downside was that not all the food on menu matches the restraint theme...and I'm not a big fan of commercially packaged theme restaurants at all but it was conveniently close to the hotel we were at and had a great bar menu. Sometimes that's all you need"}
{"text":"Wednesday wing day we will see you again. Holy freakin' awesomesauce! The wings are fantastic, perfectly crunchy on the outside and moist delishiousness on the inside. This is officially my new favorite wing joint! Loved the burger too! got a Mesquite rub on it... Amazeballs! Can't wait to go back and try some of the other stuff on that menu! To be continued..."}
{"text":"Great place!! I'm a bit of a picky person and they made my order just the way I wanted it!! And even gave me a free dessert for my birthday!"}
{"text":"love love the wings, garlic parm med,is my fav. make sure you try the fish and chips. I have my fish with onion rings, but they also have garlic parm fries. the food is sevred timely, hot and crispy, they are very accommodating for substitutions, the staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place staff super friendly extremely help full with the menu prices are great. Food was awesome you can't go wrong good selection of cold beer upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min at the table with zero service  not even  drinks got up at left. Food looked good entrée seemed priced ok. Very loud atmosphere"}
{"text":"Horrible food. I ordered hurricane salad with grilled chicken and chicken was so dry looked like it was reheated over and over. I've eaten here before and food is not good every time. Very disappointed once again"}
{"text":"I try to always find the \"positive\" in things. For instance the first time we came to this place we had great service and the food wasn't all that bad. It was a great little spot to enjoy an early dinner. Well sadly that was the one and only time. It was a nice illusion and worked on us. Eventually we wandered back into this place and well the smoke and mirrors came tumbling down. Firstly, there's never anyone at the hostess stand. I've never seen more than 5-8 tables max in this place. At first it confused me but now I see why. As someone who has lived the server lifestyle you can only imagine how much it makes me cringe to be sitting and waiting for over 10 mins for someone to take a drink order. There's no leadership no communication or any type of team work in this place. It seems like everyone on the staff moves at their own pace. If there's only 5 tables why does it take you 20 mins to get my drink and food order? As someone who knows the \"server life\" pretty well it really makes me sad to see the staff function here.   What about the food you ask? Dry, salty, almost inedible. Garlic rosemary wings is plain wings with garlic powder and dried rosemary sprinkled on top. It legit tastes like nothing but garlic powder. It's understandable now why this place is always empty. Their staff have no sense of urgency or seem to care too much about making money. Their food is a salt bomb mess. I'm sorry Hurricane but we are officially done."}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to like this place. From the outside it looks like it may have potential. Upon entering the door our first impression didn't change that much until we were seated. We immediately noticed tables were not adequately spaced for even the smallest of people to comfortably sit. We went on with the evening and ordered our drinks and the sampler. A few minutes later another table is sat behind beside us. My 1 year old sleeping in my lap and I were then pushed out of our chair so someone else could sit down. My son and I no longer had a place to sit so my family moved to a different table on our own. Shrugging off the table move we continued waiting for our food. The waiter refilled our drinks timely but left the empty glasses on the table. My sons food came first. We had ordered a cheeseburger with all the fixings. To our dismay the burger had nothing but meat, cheese, and bun. A little while later our food came and after the whole evening seemingly going shitty we were hoping the food would be enough to salvage the evening. We were wrong. The food can only be best described as \"meh\" with a side of disappointing. The honey bbq dressing was runny and not appetizing. The breaded shrimp was mainly batter and the popcorn chicken could've broken a tooth. The fried pickles while sub par compared to what you can get in the Deep South heart of Texas were the highlight of the sampler. We took the check after the sampler. We really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, my husband and I give them 3 months . We were asked to come back and give them another try. If they are still here in a year we may give it another shot. But until then we will be eating dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.   Great food Great service Great place They have many flavors of Wings and the burgers are great.  The tropical vibe is a nice getaway and all the TVs there make this the place to be to watch Sports.   Better than Buffalo Wild Wings any day"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.   Nice,  fun atmosphere and decor.  A little tough to see from the road as it's next to the hill right off I-10.   Bacon jalapeño cheese fries is amazing.  My personal favorite  flavor for the wings is garlic parmesan.  Wait staff is upbeat and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after buying a gift card on restaurant.com,  and even after teading all the bad reviews. Let me say, you really gotta try this place! We loved it. We had no problems with waiting times. Our server Cheryl was awesome. The only negative thing was that we ordered backend cajun wings & they were out. Other that that everything was great. They were hosting a fund raiser which had a dj. It was kinda loud but he was playing great music. We will definitely be returning. I do recommend this place if u want good wings in a laid back atmosphere. Oh and 60 cent wings all October!!!"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time we were there and thought I should wait a day before adding a review. Even after waiting a day, it was still a big disappointment. The place seems very nice but both times we encountered employees that seemed oblivious to what they should be doing. They are apparently poorly trained and no management to ensure they were working. Had wings 2nd time and they were fine. 1st time, had a shrimp& rice special. Really bad and didn't even look like same dish in picture. Never realized how much oblivious employees could ruin a restaurant"}
{"text":"First time here! Absolutely amazing! Great, efficient service and the wings/sauce selections were bomb!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and usually we go on Friday they usually have a live band which is cool to experience.  the service was very attentive which is great!"}
{"text":"First visit and was pleasantly surprised. Great build your own burger, flaverful meat cooked according to order with dinner style bun, highlighted with crispy fries. Hot wings crispy outside and moist inside, with several flavors to choose from. Nighy specials that include craft beer. Food was served quickly and Nicole,  our waitress, was friendy and attentive. Dog friendly patio a plus, minus one star of having a perfect setting, dirty patio and broken water misters in 103 weather, tvs covered."}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place and wanted wings so we found this place. My bf tried the wings (maple pepper and garlic rosemary). So good. I had some amazing nachos. I've been craving some good nachos and I wasn't disappointed.  Nachos were topped with yummy queso sauce, (I never find nachos with queso anymore), beef chili, jalapeños, Ancho Chile lime sauce and onions.  We went in early at 2 on a Wednesday and it was quiet. Not a long wait for anything. Beer specials always good."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Looking for a new place to go for dinner with kids. It was a good choice. Kids liked it as well! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Stabilized very well. Chocolate cake should be renamed sugar coma cake! Staff has improved and are more attentive then before. Good place for lunch too."}
{"text":"Old people...Old people...Old people  The service is good, the food is good, the crowd is VERY OLD.  I'm far from being a kid, but even I felt out of place there.  Maybe I'll be back when I retire, I suggest you wait until you do also."}
{"text":"I have ate at many wing places and hurricanes has by far the best wings i have tried!!  and not to forget the jalapeño  cheese  fries are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Biz partner and I went there today for lunch. We went at 11am, which is right when they open. Place was dead and the waitresses couldn't seem less enthused. There were more people working in the place than came in in the hour + we were there.   We ordered the bonless wings (hot). Not bad, but I'd agree with the other review comparing them to Buffalo Wild Wings. I ordered a burger, medium. It came well done and was very bland. I didn't even finish it. The fries...what can I say but WOW. I like salt, but this was crazy. WAYYYYY too much salt on them. Disgusting. Biz partner's were just as bad.    As far as ambiance, the decor is different with the island theme and all, but one guy actually mopped the floors and a waitress walked around with towels on her feet to dry it while we were there. She even joked that she was so embarrassed that she was told to do this and just wanted to sit at out table.  Then the bill came...12 wings, 2 sodas, 2 burgers...$38 without tip. Could have saved $10 and went to Applebee's. We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Took my 90-year-old mother to dinner. We were seated promptly but after 15 minutes we had to flag down a waitress. She took our drink orders as well as our appetizer order and we never saw her and it was another 15 minutes before we even got our cocktails. A different waiter  waited on us and our appetizer order was never put in. We placed our food order only to find out that one of the items we had ordered they were out of. Second choice was not very good. The nachos were extremely soggy and bland.just not a very good experience."}
{"text":"Been there with the wife twice this month and both experiences exceeded our expectations.  She had the veggie burger both times and loved it.  I, being a meat lover, tried it and was shocked by how great it tasted.  She customized it to include their really tasty and spicy teriyaki sauce, and added some sautéed mushrooms.  As an appetizer we ordered their yummy fried pickles.  We had never before had fried pickles and were pleasantly surprised by their taste.  On our first visit I ordered their five wing basket and went with the extra hot.  The wings were huge and blistering hot.  I literally asked the waitress for my blankey I was in such pain; but they were so good that I couldn't stop eating them.  I then tried their spicy shrimp tacos with rice and was blown away.  The sauce was ridiculous.  On our second visit I went with the boneless wings but just hot.  They weren't as saturated with sauce as I like, I mentioned this to the waitress, and she brought me a cup of the hot sauce and an extra ranch - at no charge.  Hurricane's hot wing sauce was the perfect balance between hot but not so hot that I began reminiscing about my blankey again.  Chicken was very tender and juicy, not dry at all.  I haven't been here for a sports-watching afternoon/evening but plan too soon and will post another review.  I'm interested to see how this place is during sporting events and in the evening.  Almost forgot to mention its gorgeous, pristine, and heated patio.    This place is extremely clean and seemingly offers a nice balance between a restaurant and a sports viewing option.  The décor makes you feel as if you're in Cali, not too far from the beach.  The kitchen is a little slow but that's to be expected with a new staff.  What impressed me most, with respect to the service, is that the employees genuinely care and go out of their way to make sure your leave satisfied.  One even offered me a glass of milk while noticing my struggles with their extra hot wing sauce.  Based upon our initial experiences, I believe place will make it first because of its food, second because of its service, and third because of its ambiance."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Friday night happy hour until 7. Got the Hurricane drink and it was delicious . Super nice bartender. Atmosphere was great. They played great music. They were super busy so we sat at the bar and got great service. The chipotle raspberry wings were amazing."}
{"text":"Went there on the recommendation of the staff at the Hampton Inn. First the food was great and so was the service. Ordered the pulled pork sliders and they were incredible. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Would have given it 4 stars however the rum and coke I got was awful, it was flat and tasted odd. Later I ask about it and they use some kind of cola mix instead of real coke or pepsi.  Great food great service will definitely return when I'm in town again"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for lunch on Sunday thinking we would get spectacular service and the food would be great.  I always like giving new restaurants a try hoping for the best.  Turns out we got the worst!  The staff excluding the management is very nice and friendly and do a great job.  When we were taken to our tables, they were not cleaned, but the hostess took care of that immediately.   We were then greeted by our waitress who brought our drinks immediately and took our orders.  It was Sunday and we requested a football game for the TV that was facing only our table, but that was never done.  Me brothers appetizer came out rather quickly, he ordered the wings.    It appears the cook does not know how to cook wings because some of them were very pink, not realizing until he had already ate most of the wings.   After about 40+ minutes waiting for our food, she finally returned with our order.   I unfortunately ordered the wings, which were undercooked as well.  Taking a bite into pink meat was disgusting especially for chicken.  At that point my lunch was ruined.    The burgers that were ordered were burnt to a crisp, very dry,  and tasted like they had cooked freezer burned meat.   The only thing they did get right was their shrimp which was very good.   After voicing a complaint about the pink meat, the waitress addressed the issue with her manager.   She said her manager will come to the table.  After waiting 20 minutes he never came, he stood behind the bar pretending to be busy as the place was not busy at all.   She came back and said my manager is going to take 10% off the bill will cook more wings.   I ate two wings which were both pink (ordered 15) , and at that point did was already feeling sick from eating raw meat practically and did not want any more food from this place.   After realizing the manager was not going to come over, I requested that they take the food off our bill.   Being a new establishment and wanting to get a good name out for their place you would think he would have come over to our table.  Apologized for the meat being undercooked, and tried to make the situation right.  Instead he sends his waitress back and with the 10% he takes an additional amount off, but not fully refunding the meal.   He never came over to our table but looked at us from behind the bar like a coward.   At this point I just wanted to get out of that place.  As my family and I were leaving he then decides to go to the door and wish us a good day, to which my son replies \"yeah if we don't get sick!\".   To which he just ignored.   Turns out we did get sick!  It was not a pleasant night for my family due to the horrible food we had from this place.   I would not recommend this place to anyone!  The management does not do what is right for their customers, and don't seem concerned about safety and sanity.    The food is terrible, over priced and maybe if you pay more they will cook it!  I have to rate this place, but if I could it would get a zero!  Please save yourself some money and sickness and avoid this place at all cost!"}
{"text":"Food on the menu looked pretty good BUT never got a chance to even order because our drinks were brought out, then 5,10,15 minutes go by and the waitress still doesn't come take our order. A family comes in and she goes right over to them and takes their order... That was our hint to leave!"}
{"text":"Good wings and you can put their large selection of sauces and rubs on any dish. They've just opened and are having some issues with the speed of the kitchen, but have been up front about it before seating you so no issues with that."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The wings were very good. Service was excellent.  Clean and well lit. Great food selection.  We would recommend Hurricane for a quick lunch, to watch a game, or to sit out on the no smoking patio. They closed up."}
{"text":"1st time here. disappointed.  menu pictures looked great,  but ....we both ordered teriyaki rice bowl with beef. very fatty pieces, and one piece was nothing but fat!  not enough teriyaki sauce which tasted great.  i would come again, but wouldstick to the burget"}
{"text":"Great food !They may be famous for their wings, but I love the other food here too. Try the Chicken Quesadillas or the Sliders. Another fave of mine is the Fish Fry on Fridays. Service is great. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They often have live music on Fridays."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary was good! Service was a bit slow at times.  Food is warm to touch. Needs to be hotter, temperature wise. Would be a good idea to have stickers on the wing orders so that we can determine what flavor we r eating.  Overall atmosphere was fine. Needs color on the walls a bit plain."}
{"text":"Decent food good prices, thought I ordered from the lunch menu a lunch deal and they charged me for each item seperately. I didn't argue. It was probably a Monday through Friday deal and it happened to be Saturday. Oh well. Foods good. Not very busy, which I like."}
{"text":"We visited hurricane on a Saturday night. I was very surprised to see that not many people were there. Especially when ASU football was on TV. The service was very very slow.  The bartender filled the draft beer all the way to the rim of the glass and made the beer flat. We were shocked that there was not a manager on duty.  I ordered the fish tacos that were deep fried. It seems as though the  greasr needed to be changed. The fish tacos came with chips as well and only one teeny tiny cup of salsa. I had to ask for more salsa and it still was not enough plus it took about 10 minutes to get it.  We came here just just after the restaurant had opened and it seemed pretty good. However, I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of this restaurant for a while now, love to come with friends and enjoy the usually delicious food and great atmosphere however, tonight was absolutely terrible. The hostess wouldn't even sit us because the servers couldn't keep up with the half full restaurant. We ordered anyway and waited 30 minutes for our cold appetizers. In the time we were waiting our drinks went empty without a server in sight. Sad to say I doubt I will ever visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Great wings with a wide selection of sauces. Don't ignore the rest of the menu. I've had some great fish here as well."}
{"text":"Sorry but these were the worst wings I ever had, no flavor, little spice or seasoning. I will not be back. Plus the service was slow but she really tried."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming CHAIN restaurant. We tried a number of things on the menu and I thought everything was pretty bad, except maybe the fish and chips. The boneless wings were the frozen over-breaded type, hard as a rock. The \"jumbo wings\" were nothing special and at $1.00 apiece, a rip off. Wing sauces nothing special. Red Lobster meets Bahama Breeze meets Applebee's. Happy hour specials were nothing exciting. Tried to charge us $5.99 EACH for a side of onion rings and fries that were supposed to be included with our wing entree order. Even if they weren't included, $5.99 is a LOT for a side of onion rings and/or fries. I won't return, even though I live close by. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great wings and service.  Get the $8.00 hurricane. Owner Mark great holster."}
{"text":"Love Hurricane Grill & Wings! They have so many sauce options for my husband, nothing is ever hot enough for him, but the top one was wonderful and he loves it. I love the fact that since I cannot eat poultry, there are a lot of other options for me on the menu! Not like other places we have went to for sure. Their happy hour is terrific and when the band is playing we always have a good time! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"It's bad for my wallet that I live right around the corner.  For a while we only went when we wanted wings but not pizza (once or twice a year), but lately, working from home and using the lunch punch and rewards cards, it's been too tempting and so we've gone more often.  It's also a good place to have drinks, especially if you live in the neighborhood, because you can just walk home if necessary.  They also have live music some nights and lots of other events and specials.  As to the rewards I mentioned, after you spend $100 you get like a $10 or $20 reward...and on Mondays, you get double points, so you could really get a reward after spending only $50.  AND after you buy 5 lunch entrees, you get a free one.  AND if you do the survey, you get free garlic parmesan fries, which are awesome.  So my only problem is that I have more free stuff than I can use in a week...or maybe a month....  Also, even though it's not on the menu anymore, ask them if they can make you a Mahi-Mahi Philly cheesesteak.  It sounds weird, but is so freaking good that after the first time I tried it, I've had a hard time getting anything else, because I crave it.  And I'm the one that usually wants something different every time, so you know it must be good if I've wanted to have it more than once."}
{"text":"We love this place so much! Honestly, the best wings ever- hands down. Perfectly crispy every time. Its a nice, small spot with outdoor seating in a very low traffic complex. We came yesterday and our daughter was just not having it- way too rambunctious, so we had to eat in shifts and take most of it home. She even dumped my hubs drink in his salad, so they brought him a new one to-go. Everyone was very nice and told us she was fine, not to worry at all. We live in the neighborhood, so we get dinner to pick up on the way home a lot. Again, best food, best people. Love it!"}
{"text":"Decided to get their burgers to-go today for lunch.  Could not have been better! Highly recommend you try it.  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Always the place to go in Surprise for wings and Beer. Try the grilled avocados. They have a nice patio as well."}
{"text":"I told the \"host\" that I was sitting outside and he promptly walked out to the table with me. He brought be a drink and that was the last I saw of any employees. My table was very visible from the front door yet nobody came to take my order. I sat there for 30+ minutes then went inside where again, no employees. I tossed my menus on the hostess stand and left. I have a limited time for lunch and there was no point in sticking around.   So the moral of the story, don't go here if you are in a hurry or you may end up like me...at the end of your lunch and still hungry!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here nearly every month for years and after tonight I will never be back.  Ran out of fish a little after 6pm (the third time this summer) and that was after we sat without silverware for 20 minutes as our food got cold.  Why?  Because there wasn't any clean silverware.  And once clean silverware came out no one brought us any.  I had to go get it for my table ourselves.   And when I chatted with the manager he confirmed they always plan to run out of fish and he was unaware of the silverware debacle.  Epic fail!  So sad I have to scratch what has been one of my favorites off my list."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible. We've been there twice and both times had service issues.  Our most recent visit was on a weeknight and the place was dead. It took awhile to seat us, food took a long time, our server acted like he was bothered by us and was more interested in flirting with other staff members. I seriously doubt we will ever go back which is a shame because the food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from this place I seen them open the place and I said I want to try it so I did and I will never ever go back I walked in was not greeted had to find my own menu and my own seat so I sat at the bar the bar tender who also was the manager ( a short bald black dude) said I'll be right with you so he knew I was there and I sat there for 10 minutes waiting and got tired so I got up and left but before I did I gave that worthless bastard a piece of my mind and I'll never be back FUCK THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"While the food is reasonably good, the service at lunch is abysmal. A friend and I took a break from work to have lunch. It took 25 minutes to get our order taken, our drinks were filled once, and then literally every employee disappeared. A half hour after we finished we finally saw one employee emerge and flagged him down so that we could pay and leave. He apologized for the \"lunch rush\" - and we looked around at the ten other people in the place and agreed that if they couldn't handle 10 people, we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"First visit here and glad we came. Nice day for eating on the patio. The service was excellent, for a very busy place. The burgers and fries were really good!  Can't wait to go back and try their other meals.  The only thing I didn't like was the loud music. They really should turn it down a notch."}
{"text":"No one comes to give you service or speak to you at the front it's like a club house and no people allowed other than the ones in there and there"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. it used to be nice and fun and have good food, I don't know if they changed management or lost cooks, but recently the last couple times I went in it hasn't reached its potential it did a year/year and a half ago. the food presentation has been lacking, food always comes out either over or under cooked, etc. If I was the manager here I would go back to the cooking staff that they had before or unchanged whatever was changed since then."}
{"text":"This place went straight to the top of my worst service experience list. Server literally yelled at me because she messed up on my order. Also took forever to get the 4 wings I ordered, then another day for the check...  And the food was mediocre at best.."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 3.5 star. The staff is friendly, it's a nice local/nearby place to go and the wings are good....the rest of the food could be a lot better, the desserts are clearly frozen and brought in and more variety of beers would be great. I get tired of having the Shock top all the time. It's very loud. But it is decent and clean and we always enjoy ourselves.  I just wish they could expand so during the busy season the wait isn't so long.   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite places to have wings and a beer.  Until I ordered to take out.  My order was wrong.  I ordered 10 Parmesan garlic and 20 buffalo.  The buffalo came with no sauce so I called to let them know.  I was transferred to the so called manager Nic.  Nic put me on hold again and came back to say the kitchen assured him there was sauce.  Nic said I could bring them back and they would re make them.  It was my Birthday and my kids were over and I told him I could not do  that.  Nic got huffy and said he could not bring them to me, which I did not expect. Never an apology, which I did expect. He started  getting upset because I assured him there was no sauce on the wings.  So he said what do you want me to do.  I called him an AHole.  He hung up on me.  Ok I get that I should not have said that.  I really only wanted him to apologize, as well as let them know what had happened.  I am in the service business and always apologize for any mistake or miss understanding.  I also appreciate knowing when something goes wrong.   My Son did call him back and he apologized to him and offered to make us the wings agin as well as a 5.00 credit.  There is no way I will ever go there again.  The food is mediocre and service is not good.  The only thing we liked were the wings.   Searching for a new place.  Let me know where that might be."}
{"text":"Horrible experience  Recently moved to the area decided to give it a try  Walked in there was no hostess at the stand so we waited around for long enough to have people start looking at us like wondering what was up She finally came and seated us at a large table that seats 6 I asked to have something smaller then she just turns and walks away leaving us to just stand there wondering If we should follow her or not because she went over to talk to another waitress and the tables around her were still dirty so we stood there looking confused when the manager came over and asked if she was taking care of us,  I said I don't know what's going on I'm confused  Then she comes back and says oh sorry I thought you were behind me  Then we sit,  I go to the bathroom,  come out and wait 10 mins,  still no drink came my husband said he ordered it before I went to the bathroom  Meanwhile it's silent in there. They have sports grill in their title yet when you walk in its bright and none of the TVs r turned up to even hear anything  A bright, quiet, restaurant with bad service and bad management Needless to say we got up and left  Ended up at Hob Nobs which is practically next door, has the correct service, ambience and management"}
{"text":"Fair at best.  Went with my 10 year old son (wife and daughters out of town) was 60 cent wing night.  First time here.....wings were below average and quite skimpy on the bone.  Had to ask for a kids menu for my 10 year old (his cheeseburger sliders were good).  Had to have bill adjusted due to an overcharge, server was not very attentive - was talking to the man at the host station.  Staff was friendly (soda refills were given by other servers who noticed empty glass).  No wet naps at a wing place????? Saving grace for me going back here may be that they broadcast UFC fights on pay-per-view with no cover charge."}
{"text":"I look forward to every Friday because Friday's are \"Fish Friday's\" and restaurants would have All You Can Eat specials on their fish baskets.  Nick's Diner II has it, Benny's Burgers, Tailgaters, etc.  When I went to Hurricane Bar and Grill and ordered their Friday Fish Fry I was in for a shock.    First when I ordered it I specifically told the waitress, \"I would like to order the Friday All You Can Eat Special\".  I was NOT corrected when I ordered it EXACTLY how I mentioned it above.  When I got my first basket I immediately ordered more fish but asked if they can bring it to me in 2's.  The waitress then proceeded to tell me that there was a LIMIT on how much I can get!  I was told that the limit was 4 additional pieces after the first basket... WHAT????  She tells me that the owner came in one day and found out that the manager had been giving out All You Can Eat baskets and stated that it was NOT CORRECT!  Every restaurant that uses the phrase \"Friday Fish Fry\" always mean All You Can Eat.  What I did not expect is that All You Can Eat at Hurricane Grill actually means after 4 additional pieces that's ALL YOU CAN EAT!    Sadly I will never go back.  I love their food but I will not tolerate being put on a limit.  It's stupid.  I have seen restaurants advertise \"Friday Fish SPECIAL\" where it says you will get a 2 piece or 3 piece basket meal.  \"Friday Fish Fry\" always meant All You Can Eat everywhere else I have eaten.  I have one cheat meal a week and it's always on Friday's because I simply love Friday Fish Fry but Hurricane got it all wrong and I will never go back.  It is absolutely STUPID how they reinvented the meaning All You Can Eat."}
{"text":"Heard some good things about this place.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.  I ordered some jumbo wings in medium and garlic Parmesan sauce.   They were bigger than most wings but not huge.  The sauce was sparse and not very flavorful.   I also ordered the mushroom burger.  It was cooked nicely and the meat was tasty.  The problem was that I couldn't taste the mushrooms or cheese.  Maybe because they are by sun city, they have to make their food bland.   I don't know but for my money, it's not worth the drive to come out here."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible save your money and go to the circle k across the street and get a hot dog it's better!!! Ordered their sampler was saturated with butter and that's saying a lot when a fat girl complains about butter, was Paula Dean in the kitchen??? Ordered a steak medium it was over done and charred!!! They took it off the bill and said they would give me a coupon really email me if u want to coupon not going back!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Hubby had pulled pork sandwich and regular fries. He was happy! I got jumbo wings with garlic Parmesan sauce and kettle chips. Yummy! Love their wings lots of meat and crisp."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon and came over for wings parmesan fries and soda. The food was awesome! We split the wings up mild and habanero rub for me. They were perfect , hot and delicious!  Matthew, our server was top notch!  Totally going to do this again"}
{"text":"Everytime I go I get the Parm fries and their Firecracker shrimp. I don't know what they put on those shrimp, but I'd drink it from a pint glass if they served it that way! Yum."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night for the live music and a few beers and the place was packed. Located in an area there aren't many bars close by they chose a great spot . The band was great and the service was not awful but the bartenders were so busy it took quite awhile to even get a beer. May I suggest another bartender or a bar back?   I ordered the steak which was well a $12 steak. The fries were cold and tasteless. My friend ordered the Cajun chicken breast meal which the only problem was there was absolutely no Cajun on it at all and we couldn't get anyones attention to fix the problem so she ate it as it was. The ginger slaw must have been sitting out for sometime as it was warm and one bite was enough but the broccoli was perfect. On the plus side we had some dry rub wings that rocked. So stick to the wings would be my suggestion and don't come when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"It's difficult to see this place which leads me to believe why it wasn't packed on a weekend around lunch time. Very clean and has a lot of great options on the menu. The garlic fries were tasty and not dripping in greesey. I ate the chicken wrap which had good flavor and tasted the wings. Wings were a good size as many places offer smaller and smaller these days however lack in the spice department. Over all a nice place, would go again."}
{"text":"I got very, very sick after eating here with some friends-I would have to blame the Diet Coke as that was the only thing different that I had (and it did taste a bit moldy, didn't drink much of it)  My friends thankfully were spared the disease. We all had chicken salads and they were nothing special but I'll likely not return due to me heaving my guts out the night before a flight to Chicago.............. Now, as a Maricopa Cty. certified food handler I know that food poisioning can take up to three days to manifest and you may not know 100% the cause of your gastro-intestinal distress.  But as I was walking to my truck after lunch my stomach was already churning and burning...."}
{"text":"Our visit was a complete disaster. We were seated right away (just 2 of us) - there was no waiting for a table so they were not super busy. It took over 15 minutes to get our drink order, and the person that brought the drinks had no idea what they were. We ordered Corona's (on tap), and he said they were Coors Light. They were in fact Corona after I tasted it. We asked for limes with it, and those took another 15 minutes to arrive. I actually went to the bar myself after a few minutes to get them, but the server did eventually remember to bring them.  When she checked in after we got our drinks we ordered dinner. She said it was National Wing Day, so we ordered the special (unlimited wings for $12.99). After ordering, it took 30 minutes to get our dinner, and that order was also messed up. Nothing big, I just ordered the chips instead of fries, but I got fries. Fine, whatever. I am not the complaining type so I just let it go.  With the dinner I ordered another Corona. 10 minutes later our server told me that they are now out of Corona on tap, and suggested I sample another beer. I said ok. Getting the sample took another 10 minutes (seriously, 10 minutes. If anything, I am understating these times it took to get these). I just said yes, bring me a glass of that and a water for my wife, knowing it would take some time before i would get it. We also ordered another plate of wings. 10 minutes later, she returned saying that they are now our of regular (bone-in) wings and asked if boneless would be ok. We just stared at each other and said fine. it took 15 minutes to get my drink, and she forgot to bring the water. Now I am starting to get frustrated at this. There are 2 couples at tables next to us, and they have been complaining to the server (the same one as us) about the slowness, missing items on the order, and other stuff.  While waiting, a different server working a table behind us spills a styrofoam cup of Sprite on the floor and it splatters all over my wife's back, head, and legs, and on my legs as well. As we are grabbing napkins to wipe ourselves off, she doesn't even look our way to acknowledge what just happened, she just walks right through the spill and on to her next table. At this point, my wife is pretty upset and would rather just leave now than wait for the rest of the wings and drinks. I am starting to agree with that.  10 minutes after all that, our wings finally come out, and they are the regular ones (that were allegedly out). The server comes to us and says, \"Huh, looks like they found some bone-in ones\". After looking at them, they are significantly smaller than the ones we had earlier, and their claim on their signs and menu are \"Jumbo Wings\". These were definitely NOT jumbo wings. I seriously think they were stalling so someone could run to Fry's and pick up some more bone-in wings for the rest of the night. They were literally half the size of the ones we got earlier.  This was the last straw for me. I am a pretty patient person, and I have been a cook in restaurants like this before so I know how it works behind the scenes. We witnessed 2 other tables complaining to our server about the bad food/service, and another man, with a group of 10-12 (mostly kids) quite upset talking to a manager as well. As I said earlier, they were not very busy (this was a Wednesday night, and it is their regular $.60 wing night anyways, on top of the National Wing Day promotion, so they should have been prepared for the volume this promotion would generate).  When we finally got the bill (which took 15 minutes after asking for it), there were 3 additional drink charges on it. It took over 5 minutes to get the server to fix it and bring us a new, correct bill. We sat down at out table at 7:25pm, and did not leave until 9:35pm. That was not because we enjoyed the ambiance either. It was the result of the lengthy waits for anything to happen. With all of these issues, and it was only a Wednesday night, I cannot excuse this experience, and thus I am writing this review to warn others of what might happen if you choose to come here. It may not be quite as exasperating as our's was, but some of these are bound to happen to everyone. Clearly this is a management and training issue. It felt as though the management does not care about the business, their employees performance, or getting any return customers.  All of this overshadows the fact that their sauces (which seems to be the main focal point of the restaurant) are in fact very good. We tried 6 different ones, and we each loved 5 of them (we weren't big fans of the honey garlic, but it wasn't bad either). We have been to their location in Minneapolis about 4 months ago and had a great experience there. This was the exact opposite of that, and I will not be gong back to this one ever again. I hope that they can work these issues out, or they will not be open much longer."}
{"text":"OK Folks - they have a new chef that started a month ago.  I don't know what it was like before, but there was 9 of us last Saturday and the food was great!  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  My mom, the hamburger connoisseur, said it was the best hamburger she had in 10 years!  The wings were very good.  The location makes it hard to see/find, so give it a try and spread the word."}
{"text":"Wife and I arrived at 6 pm.  Seated promptly, waiter arrived at 6:10 brought us our drink order 6:15.  Never stopped by again.  In the interim, he took food orders from 2 tables that arrived after we did.  Left at 6:30.  When we reached the door, hostess said \" have a good evening\".  I told her to tell our waiter that  we were leaving, thanks for the Coke!    Walked across to Picasso's.  Great Food, Great Service."}
{"text":"I can't believe all these reviews that say the fried fish is good what are you aren  on!! First of all they brought it to the table it look like it was a week old and they re-fried it.  I bit into it and got a mouth full of water so it was definitely frozen . So I changed it to a steak sandwich wrong idea I should've just left bid it to the steak sandwich and I couldn't get my teeth through it it was so tough needless to say I will never go here again last time I listen to reviews by snowbirds LOL"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday with my mom..if you like BBQ sauce the pork taco is yummy..The bartender Wendy is congenial and efficient...nice gal."}
{"text":"Noting I don't like about this place, mahi rice bowl good and spicy my favorite for lunch! Wendy's a jewel and very attentive. J C also very accommodating and friendly to a fault."}
{"text":"Sad to say, the Hurricane near Eastern and Horizon Ridge has closed only a couple months after opening.  Wish I'd had a chance to go there, was always on my to-do list.  I entered three stars because I had to enter something."}
{"text":"Great wings but sad to say they are now closed - looking at the past reviews of slow service, that might have been the reason why."}
{"text":"Amazing service, ordered the wings which were huge! Not battered and served \"naked\", the dry rub garlic Parmesan was yummy and the hot buffalo sauce. The cheesy bacon jalapeño fries are the best ever!!! My sister got the honey chipotle boneless wings and she loved them. The mango lemonade was so refreshing and our waitress even offered to-go drinks which make any pregnant lady happy. The environment is clean and staff was all welcoming. The prices are decent and much to choose from on the menu. Not a huge dessert selection but the food itself fills you up and to take home for later."}
{"text":"this is a good place though it is usually busy so the wait times can get long. They need to hire more staff"}
{"text":"My friend is a huge \"wing\" fan and just loves this place.   I found myself on this side of town at lunch time and decided to give it a try.   Very clean and colorful strip mall.  The mall was not crowded at all.  The restaurant has ample outdoor covered seating with misters.   My 80 yr old mom preferred to sit inside.   Cute and fun decor.  Bartender promptly greeted us and told us to select where our choice of seating.  Selected a booth, they have four & eight tops.   Our server Kyle was friendly, great positive vibe and easy on the eyes.      Mom order fish and chips.  Like the fish and fresh cut frys, but the coleslaw was more of a sour cream base so not a fan.  We both prefer the sweet version.  I chose the hand dipped chicken tenders with sweet potato straws with a black pepper sauce, loved it.  Their menu is large and crowd for a Saturday was a nice mix of young families, groups of singles and elderly from the neighborhood.   I heard one table mention they had a groupon so your may want to check.  We didn't try the wings but they serve over 30 sauces bone in & boneless.  Live music on Fridays and karaoke on another night.    I will definitely come back.  I would like to give one of their salads a try.  They loved great."}
{"text":"Went last night, will be returning againCole was are waiter, first day on the job and he was great. Cajun fish taco were yummy, wish they served 3, 2 was not enough! Hubby had the chard burger and enjoyed it very much. Only suggestion, white wine should be served chilled and that wasn't the case, but I drank it anyway. Waiter was kind enough to run my sun glasses out to me in the parking lot, I appreciate that! Nothing better than good customer service"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Service was almost nonexistent on the patio. You can tell they cater to the older population around here that has nothing but time on their hands. Went 15 minutes with an empty glass. Server walked by twice and no refill. Had to ask for a drink refill for which there is no excuse.  Star added for quick response and desire to improve from business. I'll be giving them another shot."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times now.. it has always taken a little longer than most restaurants to get our food.. but this time was completely awful in more ways than just that. It was not busy in any way... It took a little less than 5 minutes to even be greeted. After taking our drink order, our server told us she would be right back to get our food order.  After 15 minutes the bartender brought us our drinks.. our server still did not come back after another 10 minutes. After 30 minutes our server finally took our order. We ordered a basket of fries as an appetizer, and she brought us a side. When we told her that we ordered the appetizer of fries.. she told us they didn't carry that anymore. And brought us another side that they charged us for. Then after being at the restaurant for over an hour.. we received our wings that we order.. which came out with the wrong sauces. We then asked for a couple sides of ranch, for our order of 20 wings.. she brought us, one small ramekin of ranch.. Then after waiting for our check for another 10 minutes.. we hand to wave down another server to get it for us. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND EXPERIENCE all together!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night for football.  Wasn't too busy. The waitress was Awesome and refills were always taken care of. Friendly and knew the menu. They have a public service discount for police and fire, which is 15% off the entire bill. Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"Good... not great. The food was good. The menu was a twist on the same ol same ol... so that was nice... the problen was the service... if you weren't belly up to the bar you were ignored! Took 12 minutes to get seated. 8 minutes to get drinks. 7 MORE minutes before order was taken... they were not that busy... Waitress did not know the wifi password. We had to ASK for EVERY refill! Things like that drive me nuts. Anywho... I'm all about 2nd changes so I'll be back...  It's just not worth the drive from Litchfield/Waddell..."}
{"text":"Wings are bigger than most places, but, price supports it. Had my wings plain, extra crispy. They were done perfectly. Tried a couple of their signature sauces if which they have 40. Their menu is well illustrated and the waitress explained how to best read the choices. Service was friendly and great. They wife had the Caribbean chicken.  It was good. Will try this place again and especially on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Worst ever. Waited for initial order server took at least 10 minutes.  Not busy at all.  Got our food. No one asked if it was ok. Our drinks were empty. 22 minutes before server came back. Saw him across the restaurant on his phone.  We won't be back"}
{"text":"We have driven by this place so many times and didn't try it because we thought--yay--another dive bar...they won't be here long. Were we ever wrong! This place has been here in Surprise for at least 5 years now; standing strong against all the other restaurants that have come and gone in this particular strip mall. I'm not sure why, but as we were driving by, I thought--WHY NOT? So my son and I went in for lunch. As we walked in we were pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was, in the middle of the day in the middle of the week.  We were greeted and seated promptly. . We both enjoyed tacos for lunch that were out of this world! My son had the firecracker shrimp tacos which he loved and I had a chicken taco special that was excellent. We were pleased with the service and how quickly our food came out considering the place was packed. We are looking forward to a return trip with the rest of the family!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Saturday afternoon in February in Phoenix.  The weather was AMAZING and my fiance and I were looking for a place we could sit outside where there weren't a bunch of people smoking cigarettes (we had our toddler with us).  I had driven by this place before and wanted to try it, so we drove by to check if they had a patio.  They did, so in we went.    They really put a lot of effort into the atmosphere.  I LOVE the beachy feel - I almost feel like they did it better than Sandbar on Ray Road.  They had the wall between the patio and the restaurant open since it was so nice outside, and I noticed misters with fans and heaters out on the patio for when the weather isn't so nice.    We ordered an appetizer - don't remember what it was called officially, but it was a sampler style.  The fried pickles and garlic fries were awesome!  I can't speak for the shrimp or whatever else was on it because I don't eat meat or seafood.  The dipping sauces it came with were all tasty, too.  They ranged from mild to spicy cheese.  Love it!  I ordered a veggie burger with garlic parmesan broccoli.  The burger wasn't cooked as well as I usually like, but I didn't specify \"well-done\", either.  Everything else was surprisingly good.  My fiance ordered soime wings and said they were okay, but he LOVED the appetizer and beer selection, and agreed with me on the atmosphere.    Our server was attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back.  I highly recommend this place when you're looking for better-than-normal bar food and a great place to spend some time in the sun (before April comes...)!"}
{"text":"T.J. is simply the best!!! We had an experience that left me and my coworkers flat, T.J. went way above and beyond and saved us as loyal customers. T.J. we will continue to come once a week based on your service and the yummy food of course!!"}
{"text":"Gotta try the Jumbo wings here! Hands down best wings in the Phoenix area! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Second try. Should have stuck with our first instinct. This place won't last long. Came to dinner with my 9 & 10 year old children and sat in the patio since they were starting up a poker game in the restaurant. Within 25 minutes  there were 3 tables taken from the patio and chairs being moved around. The man who is running the poker game is disgustingly rude. Picked up two chairs knocking down another and just leaves the chair in the ground. If that's not bad enough, there are only 2 waitresses working tonight so our order of wings, a burger and 4 salads took 30 minutes to get. And the waitress forgot the salads so those came out within minutes of the wings.  Granted the wings are okay, meatier than natives but the selection of 40 rub/sauce options are mediocre at best. If you like over cooked wings or extremely crunchy they do that well. Also the turkey burger is horrid. A frozen patty on a soggy bun.    This is not my idea of dinner and a show. I feel like I wasted $65 on dinner here."}
{"text":"Well, the food was good but the waiter... he had no clue. The young man didn't write down our orders and could not remember mine!! After asking me 3 times I told the bartender that maybe he wasn't too smart in not writing down my order!  Sorry but I was annoyed, my friend had her food way before me. I was then asked to not return... NO PROBLEM... I don't need bad waiters...sad... Learning is part of life...write down the orders=no problems..."}
{"text":"Okay, overall not impressed. The drinks had to be sent back because tonight's bartender can't make standard mixed drinks 11/15 at 8 pm.  The wings, although cooked well, lacked flavor. We bought the 20 wings with 4 flavors and none of them had taste. If you're going to spend money on good wings go to Native or the Vine, heck Applebee's has better wings.  The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the server was really nice.  Good job Jordan.  Oh, the fries were good. Unfortunately, this place will last about 6 months based on the other reviews and my experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Amazing service too!! My 21 month old son devoured the food!!!   We will definitely be back for more!!!   Great place and family environment!!"}
{"text":"Why this place isn't my first thought for wings I'll never know. Come see Morgan and get the extra hot. Perfect crisp and just enough sauce. Great beer selections and always ice cold."}
{"text":"Ordered 20 jumbo wings to go.  10 with Jamaican Jerk sauce and 10 with \"Hot\".  They're not lying when they say these wings are jumbo.  They're huge!  Lots of meat on both the drums and the wingettes.  The Jamaican Jerk sauce has good, rich jerk flavor with a little bit of heat.  Very tasty.  The \"hot\" just wasn't hot enough for me.  Tasted more like most places' \"medium\".  Luckily, there are two levels of heat in the Buffalo sauces hotter than \"hot\".  I'll have to try these next.  Can't miss with these wings.  I'm looking forward to eating in and trying something different and having some beer."}
{"text":"Oct 6.  Crowded on Friday night.  Not enough wait staff.  15 minutes and no one approaches the table.  Place is great during the week and AVOID on weekends.   Sad."}
{"text":"First off our serviced Miranda was awesome! She cared about us having and enjoyable experience and an asset to this establishment.   The food was great. Everything came out as ordered and the proper temperature. The best part was all the creative flavors this place has to offer. It's not your typical wings and grill. It is truly amazing! We will be back again. I recommend the \"coco loco\" sauce!"}
{"text":"1st try at this beach themed sports bar....sound familiar? Menu has something for everyone but wasn't executed great.   I enjoyed a fresh salad with plenty of moist chicken. Thankfully avoided the overly sweet dressing.   The Cajun chili burger barely had any of either on it. Fries were terrible.   On the bright side the muddy tea and soda had free refills.   Great service and plenty of big TV's.  Next time I'll stick with wings and beer."}
{"text":"OMG - LOVE! I'm so glad I came here despite the reviews. My husband and I got a few beers and the wing lunch special. He loved the boss sauce with a side of buffalo extra hot and kettle chips. I got the garlic lemon rosemary (lacking a bit in the rosemary flavor) and dry rub Cajun seasoning with a side of garlic ginger sauce and a Cesar salad. I absolutely loved the garlic ginger sauce! The place has a really cool margaritaville atmosphere that's really chill. We will definitely be back for the all day happy hour on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area so my boyfriend and I are looking for a local place to hang out and enjoy food-beer. This is literally right down the street. Definitely love the atmosphere and the boneless wing Wednesday is a great deal, $.50, I'm in! (Plus the boneless wings are huge and actually have meat on them unlike other wing places I have gone). The only thing I have to say, is the hot scale is a little off, I like spicy/hot and they're hot is barely a tingle to me. But flavor wise of the sauces, amazing! Firecracker is one of my favorites, next to the mango habanero. Get a start, the jalapeño/cheese fries - amazing! I am tempted to try their sandwiches next. Pretty stoked."}
{"text":"I really liked this place the first time that my family and I went to eat there.  Nice ambiance and a good place to take the kids.  We decide to take our friend and her family there and get the worse service.  Only half of us got our food at the same time.  When I finally got my food, my friends where already done and my hamburger bun was soaking wet.  I asked for a side of bbq sauce and got hot sauce instead and then the server changed me for the side of hot sauce.  We talked to the manager and he was very nice.  Comped my food and apoligized."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for awhile!! It has gone down. We ate here for lunch, when I sat down I asked to order an appetizer from our server. Thirty minutes later we had no food not even our appetizer. I flagged down the bartender and she got us our chips. Another server brought us our food after amp her ten minutes. When I picked up my taco it split in half. It had sat so long the grease had made the tortilla soggy.  Our server finally came out with all smiles like nothing happened. Poor service, poor food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place for their Chile lime churrasco and onion rings with ranch dressing.  Love their wings extra chrispy!  I always get their hee-haw junction drink too.  Best ever!!!!"}
{"text":"hello there I gone to this place a few times I was told try the fish fry Friday I had it and it was good  pass that along"}
{"text":"Excellent food and fab service is what gets the 5 stars! Inside has a surf atmosphere, very open with TV 's everywhere. Menu is slightly confusing but while enjoying an appetizer we figured it out. Our server was courteous and friendly. I had the wings and they didn't disappoint! Big wings, wished the garlic in the Parmesan was slightly stronger. Menu looked to offer lots to choose from. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I came here after being given horrible service at the Hob Nob down the street and left. Immediately upon walking in, I was greeted. I said I would just sit at the bar to watch the game. The bartender that night, Jason, was awesome. Lots of TVs to watch just about any game happening that night. They also have some pretty good daily and Happy Hour specials.  The food was okay, although I did love the garlic parmesan fries (they are *really* garlicky with lots of parmesan though, which I like).  Nice outdoor patio with misters.  I ended up coming back a fe weights later to watch another game and was treated to the same good service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great menu! Cold beer and the wing sauce variety is outbid this world!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, and great food and our server amanda was amazing. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"My husband I went there for dinner.  We ordered the cheese fries for starters and they were awesome.  We had the boneless wings (Honey BBQ ) for our meal and they were really good too. I really liked this place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance on what I thought would be their sort of Super Bowl, National Chicken Wing Day, on 7/29.  My first experience was dismal but just chalked it up as them working everything out since it was during the first week of this location's opening.  What I hated about the first experience is going to mirror my second experience.    What made my first experience dismal was how the chicken wings were overcooked and the sauces were not proportional.  Other than the back of the office being well below our standards, the front of the house was great and attentive during this first experience.  Fast forward to our second experience and we were once again treated to a similar food experience with overcooked and unpleasant tasting food.  Compounding to the bad food from the back of the house, the second experience was much worse.  For the second experience, the front of the house was under-staffed.  And it took us forever to get any drinks as well!  I fully fault the manager as they should have been prepared for this day.  For Christ's sake, they had a huge banner up specifically for the Wednesday 60 cents wings special along with flyers throughout the restaurant advertising the All You Can Eat $12.99 special.  Adding to this, their website even had the $12.99 National Chicken Wing Day too.  Not only did Management set their restaurant up for failure through under-staffing, I couldn't even see what would appear to be a Manager during the two hours we were there.  That's right!  Two hours of waiting!!    I went with the All You Can Eat wings for $12.99 and my GF went with a seasonal Tropical Mango grilled chicken salad.  My wings took forever to come out!  I only ordered a second round of wings due to how I couldn't waste anymore time waiting on the back of the house to send wings out!  Not only did the wings take what felt like a year, they were terribly overcooked!  My GF's salad wasn't pleasant for her since she said the pineapple tasted as if it came from a can.  She also didn't care for the dressing.  In closing, we've given this place two tries to get their crap together.  They've failed each time and are in no way close to being the location in Surprise which is much much better IMO.  It's appearing to me that Management is under-staffing their restaurant which is indicative of it being on life support.  We won't be giving this place another try.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me..."}
{"text":"Awesome wings. Kaylee was great, and cute, and she kept our beers full. Too many Seahawks fans, Will definitely be back though."}
{"text":"Ok, so I just ate lunch here (like 10 minutes ago :o)) Anyway, it was pretty good. Someone from there was marketing and came into my work with a free lunch voucher, so I figured I'd try it out. So, I go in, atmosphere is relaxed, decor is island-ish, nice new establishment. I really like the muraled walls. When I gave the waitress my voucher she had that annoyed attitude. Here's my thought, the free voucher is to get me in, try the food, and want to come back. If the service is poor, then you just lost business and the free meal was a waste. ANYWAY, I ordered the boneless wing platter (wings and fries and another side). It's $9.99. I'd say the price fits what you get. I got 10 boneless wings in the sauce of my choice with fries. I wanted a salad with my platter instead of coleslaw, she said there's a charge. Salad was big for a side salad and it was good. You can sample wing sauces before picking one, I ended up with the medium hurricane sauce, the normal hot wing sauce. I loved it. It had good flavor and went nicely with fries. I'd say this is definitely the beer and wing joint, the menu is just appetizers, wings, and sandwiches and they have a full bar. One disappointment is that their happy hour food deals are not great."}
{"text":"My friend was right! The Mahi fish tacos are pretty good! They are grilled so you don't feel as bad about eating them. The firecracker shrimp tacos have a little kick in the flavor, but they are definitely not spicy.  I ordered hurricane rice instead of fries to go with the seafood tacos, but I guess the waitress forgot to tell them, so I ended up with fries. The regular fries were overcooked and lacked taste. It was a strange texture because once you bit into the fries, there was a crunch but it seemed like nothing was inside the fries. My other friend got the sweet potato fries, which I didn't know was even available, and that was much better than the regular fries. I'm not sure if it's always this way with the fries, or we just tasted the regular fries on a \"bad\" day, but just to be sure, I'm going to order the sweet potato fries next time. I should probably try the wings next time, since that is in the title of their restaurant/bar, but I didn't want to have buffalo chicken wing breath before going back to work. I like this place though. This was my second time back."}
{"text":"The neighborhood grill that never disappoints. Great food, friendly service and live music on the weekends. Sliders are delicious and they have a ton of different  wing sauces for their tasty wings. The outdoor patio is our favorite hangout. Currently serving 4 peaks pumpkin porter for the season. ..yum!"}
{"text":"50 cent wings and Karaoke with my beer.  What a nice way to end the work day.   Sports on the tv for the guys. Features a full bar and the menu is unique.  They also have a secret menu.  Ask for the Arizona menu.  I like the grilled cheese from the AZ menu.  Everyone is really nice and there is no pressure to hurry up eat and get out.  They also have a nice patio that also is accommodating to the bartender for perfect weather like tonight.  Beautiful water fountains outside too make it more enjoyable.  Probably will come back when possible."}
{"text":"We here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Very clean and bright. There were a few people at the bar and they look to be having a great time. We were seated in the back of the restaurant and the seats were a little uncomfy.   The waiter came with a smile and took our drink order. I had the Citrus Ice Tea which was pretty good. Mrs. Had the regular tea which was decent. We then proceeded to order the Firecracker Shrimp. There was a little too much batter and it wasn't as spicy as anticipated. But we ate it. The sauce that accompanied it was great.   I then ordered ten wings with the Garlic Parmesan sauce and also the Trifecta sauce (combo of three dry rubs). Mrs. Order the boneless wings with the salt and vinegar sauce. When the wings came out I was surprised to see little to no sauce or seasoning on them. Having dry rubs before and not really being able to see the seasoning, I figured I would be able to taste it. Wrong!! It was like I was eating chicken straight out the fryer. They were pretty blah. And the boneless wings...too much breading no flavor. Her side salad was great though.   If I go back I would definitely get a wet sauce and try it at happy hour."}
{"text":"They have a nice outdoor patio and it was a beautiful Saturday afternoon so we had lunch outdoors. The service was friendly but slow. The fish tacos were good but the chips and salsa side was ordinary. It was an ok place for lunch but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! The staff is extremely incompetent! The \"manager\" doesn't manage anything, yet constantly steps on the toes of her staff smiling and grinning at their tables while I count 6 dirty tables. This place will not last long! The food is overrated and the kitchen sucks. This restaurant deserves an special on Bar Rescue, but oh wait it's not considered an bar, maybe that's why it stays dead. Save your money and go somewhere that the staff and management doesn't have the deer in an headlight look!"}
{"text":"Well I have heard great things about this place so me and my husband and friends went there on a sunday got a table and waited for about 10 minutes before the waitress came over to get are drink orders. Strike 1. she takes are drink order,and the men in the group ordered beer and us ladies has sodas. The bartender actually ran are beers over to our table. Strike 2. the place was not busy. The waitress then comes back over to take our order and forgot are sodas,Strike 3. The food was really good but if you are expecting great service i would suggest to take your order togo."}
{"text":"We went to Hurricane Grill and Wings on Sunday to watch football and have some beers and food.  It is a nice, very clean place with ice cold beer, which is always good.  They had buckets of beer for $10 on special which is a good price.  However we ordered a round of shots that were made with Smirnoff and were charged $7 as piece for them.  $7 for Smirnoff is awfully expensive at any bar.  The food was decent, but had to be sent back as it came out wrong.  No big deal, it happens all the time.  When the food was returned, it was decent enough, but nothing better than any other bar food around.  Overall, we had a good time and the restaurant is kept up very well.  The bartenders were also very nice and attentive.  However, the bill came to $125 for an appetizer, a couple of entrees, 2 buckets of beer and those expensive shots.  Oh, the location is terrible and I will be interested to see if they can make it more than a few months, as nothing else has worked there.  Best of luck to them."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was great.  The band was not so good.  Their song selection was great but the drummer was bad!   It was dreadfully loud even in the farthest corner."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, food, and fun! Servers are awesome. Shout out to bartender Sean and server Allie. Free poker on Monday night's with a great bunch of people. Meeting new friends and making $$$!!! Come on down!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We came here for dinner on Saint Patrick's day. The environment of this place was awesome. They had a nice bar area, and also patio seating. There was a live band playing country music which I loved!!! There were customers dancing to the music, while others were enjoying their dinner. They have live music every Friday but because it was Saint Patrick's day, they played on Saturday as well.   The service was great. Our waitress Shiloh was so helpful with our orders. She was very tentative and always with a great smile when coming over to help us. She made sure that we got everything we needed and was very quick with our orders after we told her that we were all very hungry.   The food here is delicious as well. My friend order a burger and I had a bite of it, it was so tasty. I've craving another bite of it just thinking about it. I order tacos and that was also good. But my favorite were the wings. The bbq sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but the other flavor was yummy.   Their pricing is very reasonable. I would totally come back here again for some nice country music and great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very good wings and onion wings. Tried the hot buffalo and hot honey mustard. The menu had quite a few options and I'm anyone would have been able to find something they would like. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best wings I've had...I was able to taste them after having bar hopped with a great friend.  They have the biggest selection of sauces I have ever seen!  The wings are huge and they do not skimp on this sauce!  Fries were crispy and tasty...service was quick and beer was cold.  I mean what more can you ask for.    They have a huge patio and you can sit at the bar while still sitting outside which is great at this time of the year in AZ!"}
{"text":"Overall rating B-/C+  Good: Huge selection of very diverse & unique sauces for your wings. We tried 6 and all were good. Arrived 7pm on a Friday night, it was packed but only had to wait about 10 minutes.   Needs improvement: Quality control in the cooking process. A few of our wings had literally no meat on them (they advertise them as large/jumbo). As a result a day later I still have that dreaded taste of chewing on grilled grease in my mouth, yuk! Also your servers don't serve you, they just take your order then somebody else delivers your drink or food. Seems to be a very disconnected process. Took about 10 minutes to get another cup of ranch as the server took the request then hands it off to someone else to fulfill without any reconciliation between the two to guarantee the task was done.   Additional comment: it is a big open space with no interior walls or noise dampening structures in place. As such it was very loud as we almost had to shout across the table to one another and there was no background noise but other patrons.  This place has a fighting chance if they improve the quality of their food and and improve their service coordination. I realize they've only been open about 2 weeks , hopefully it doesn't take them much longer to get things straightened out. Will likely try again in a month and see."}
{"text":"They were ok. Nothing above and beyond. They at centrally located for our area and if they were friendlier it could have been a. Enter experience. Nothing was wrong there just not a very upbeat place for middle aged people. We were surrounded by older crowd made it hard to enjoy yourself like a bar or grill should be. I still swing by occasionally the food is decent."}
{"text":"2 of us wanted to try this place for dinner on a Saturday evening. We were told 20-30 minute wait when they had at minimum of 12 tables open that we counted. Can't foresee trying this place again."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this new bar slash restaurant.  Not impressed.  I had thier ok tasting hamburgers.  I was happy with the  cold beer  The food gets a \"c\" grade and the beer an \"A\" grade.  The service a \"c\".  I will not return."}
{"text":"I have a question? When you order a sandwich here, are you not supposed to get an order of fries with your sandwich, or is it just the small sandwich?  My fiancee came in about an hour and a half ago. I ordered 20 Garlic Inferno wings, garlic and parmesan fries, and a steakhouse sandwich. First, I thought the fries were an appetizer instead of a side, but I will digress on this point , as there are many negative aspects to this visit. First, the steakhouse sandwich my fiancee ordered DID NOT come with fries (I do not know if this is standard, but it seems to me that a sandwich would come with a side, no?) Next, when I placed my order (which was to go), the person on the other end of the phone seemed like she could care less and she didn't want to be there. After, I placed my order, I asked the phone operator for a COMPLETE total so I knew how much would be going on my credit card. Instead, she read me how much each item would be separately, which was not what I asked for.  When my fiancee picked up the order, she was greeted by disinterested and angry employees. I love this place, but I implore you to please get some employees who actually give a damn about your business because tonight was completely unacceptable.  As a coup de grace, my fiancee did not leave a tip because I do not tip to go orders, and she was using my card, and when the to go waitress saw this, she threw the pen in my fiancee's direction as though she expected her to change it.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! I hope you will take appropriate actions so that this does not happen again. I am not sure if we will return!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go to chill and have some wings. The food is decent. The drinks are expensive, but mediocre. We could get a higher end meal somewhere else for the same price. If it was cheaper to eat and drink here, we would go there all the time. The wing flavors are really good, but my husband and I haven't had anything else we liked. Service is typically very slow and it's awkwardly quiet. When it comes down to it, the wings and beer are what we go to Hurricane's for. 3 stars might be too high, but it's a cool place to hang out at with all of the TVs playing sports while eating wings and drinking beer."}
{"text":"Went there and had fish taco's.  Woke up the next morning with GI problems that lasted the whole day.  Almost didn't make it in time to the bathroom.  Called the restaurant and left a message for the manager.  Never got a call back. I didn't expect a call back just wanted them to know that they need to watch the cream sauce they put on the taco."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to give this restaurant a two rating, and I'm only giving it a two because the food is amazing. During our first visit we found the wait for our food to be quite lengthy, and then the waitress only brought out one of the meals when we ordered two. I guess we weren't clear when we said we wanted two of the same meal, so she only brought one. During the next visit the wait for our food was quite lengthy again, and Service was mediocre at best. The waitress was friendly but not very competent. I don't even think we got refills on our drinks. We came back a third time because we really like the food, and that we give the service another try. Unfortunately this turned out to be our worst visit ever. Each time the restaurant is quite empty but it appears as though the waitstaff is overwhelmed. We started off by placing orders for our drinks, and to our dismay it took at least 10 minutes just to get The ice tea, soda and waters. I did get a pretty tasty beer that was on special that night though. Although it was taco Tuesday we stuck with the original that we like to order, although it was no longer on the menu the waitress assured us that the cook would prepare it for us. it is a tilapia dish with shrimp on it and comes with two sides, it's extremely tasty and low-calorie. The waitress explained that new management was taking over and making some changes to try to branch away from the restaurant chain. She did say that most items would still be available to order they just wouldn't be listed on the menu. After another lengthy wait the two kids meals and one of our adult meals arrived. Again my husband and I had ordered the same meal but only one arrived, the waitress said that the other would be brought right out. She hadn't forgotten it she just said that the other three meals were ready so she thought she bring them out to get us started.  I assumed that meant she would be back in the next couple minutes with my meal, my husband tried to give me the one meal but I insisted he had it because I was gladly sipping on my beer. 20 minutes go by and I still do not have my meal and my family was near done with theirs. My husband went to the hostess and asked for a manager and approximately 10 minutes later he started walking towards our table with my meal. Before he even approached the table my husband asked him to turn around and bring it back because we no longer wanted it because it had been a half hour since everybody else had received theirs. He silently turned around and went back to the kitchen. He did return a couple minutes later with an apology and said our meal was on him.  My husband expressed his major concerns to the manager and let him know this was our third visit and each time we had extremely poor service with tonight being the worst service we've ever had at any restaurant. He was apologetic and explained they're going through some management changes and assured us that within a couple of months improvements would be made. We originally advised him we would never be back to this establishment, but after his apology we said we'd be back in a couple months to give it a try again. The food is really good but the service is the worst we've ever had and we eat out a lot. I will continue to check the reviews over the next couple months and decide if it will be worth our time to give this place another try. If they can get their waitstaff as good as they prepare their food this would be an amazing place to go. If not they clearly won't be in business much longer."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to eat here as we got a half price coupon and we really enjoyed urself.  The food was good as was the atmosphere.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Food was awesome.....service was spotty.....they were kinda busy though.....drinks r kinda pricey......50cent boneless wings were great....large selection of sauces too....karaoke W/ Arie was GREAT......over all a good night...."}
{"text":"I had to sign up with Yelp just to review this place and give it a fair chance... Rating is more like 4.5 stars.  I've been there 3 times now, and the last time was a busy night when other places that could accommodate 10 people had a 1-2 hour wait.  This place had ample seating for all of us, AND they were nice enough to split the bill up 10 ways which suprized me (and tip was not auto-included).    I got another set of 10 wings, 2 different flavors and they were delicious as always... The wings arent much better than any other wing joint, but if you like unique variety then that's where they get a 5 star.  Lemon Pepper, Mango, Maple Brown Sugar and 3 kinds of Parmesan wings won me over.  All the flavors I've tasted were pretty good, but a few of the 'medium' category (Ancho Lime Chili) could stand to be a little hotter.  My GF got the veggie burger which she said was better than most.  They also dust the kettle chips with a dry rub powder that's pretty savory.  Cole Slaw was so-so as part of the platter, and prices were about average.  Go on Wednesday to test them out for discount wings.  The two hottest flavors WILL make your eyes swell, so be warned.  I've had the waiter others talked about (who forgets things occasionally) and while he had to come back to ask questions, I don't see a problem with him re-verifying our order.    Overall a good experience, nice to have another wing option in town."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place. My whole family really likes chicken wings, and I have to say this place takes the cake compared to other restaurants serving wings in the area. Not only is their sauce good, but the size of their wings are huge compared to other restaurants. I don't feel like I'm being cheated since the price of wings has gone up so much lately. I feel like I'm still getting what I want to get out of my money. I have eaten both in restaurant and gotten takeout. My experiences have been nothing but excellent either way."}
{"text":"I don't give four stars lightly. Although this is a chain restaurant and has only been open a few days, I can definitely tell you I will be back.   We have seen this particular location go through two other restaurant iterations. Mexican and Steakhouse. Both failed miserably to keep up with food quality. As a local to the area I am so glad this location has been given new life.   We visited on the second or third night of its opening. It was a great place to watch the World Series game. The happy hour prices and food choices were acceptable though we did not order from that menu. Instead we ordered one of their sirloin dinners. The steak and broccoli was delicious and cooked perfectly. The cilantro tomatoes were a bit pink and underripe but still tasty. The portions are good but you will not have left overs. Try as many sauces as you can. They are amazing!  We had the beer mixers. I highly recommend the Snake bite with hard cider and Guinness.   We also had the caramel crumble cake for dessert. Very tasty but definitely a trucked in food.   We will be back for their wings and all their sauces. Eight pm to midnight 75 cent wings!"}
{"text":"I've never written a review on Yelp but after having boneless wings here a couple years ago that were a little too salty, we decided to try it again because we live down the street. We've had amazing food these past few times. Completely satisfied. TJ was a great server too. Very nice and not fake."}
{"text":"We had a bought a Groupon for this place and it was getting ready to expire so we decided to use it this past Sunday. We were seated right away and our server took our order for a couple of iced teas. Although we had a Groupon for   wings and fries I wanted to try the deep-fried pickles so we started with an order of those. They came with a side of \"cyclone sauce\" that went really well with them. I liked the fact that the breading wasn't too thick and the flavor of the pickle came through. We ordered the jumbo wings with half Gold Rush (a honey mustard with just a bit of heat) and half Honey Garlic. The wings were pretty big and meaty which was really nice and they were cooked perfectly - still juicy on the inside while the outsides were nice and crispy. The Gold Rush was our favorite although to be honest we have had better elsewhere. The Honey Garlic was too watery and didn't stick to the wings at all so we left those to bring home so we could slather our own BBQ sauce at home. The garlic french fries would have been good if they had been hot. Unfortunately they were lukewarm at best and after a few minutes they were cold and unappetizing. I was surprised that even though they were as cold as they were it didn't stop a puddle of oil from forming under the container they came in. Our server was nice and made sure to check on us periodically. I also saw that they offer karaoke on certain nights of the week which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Been driving by this restaurant for quite some time so my boyfriend & I decided to give it a try. As soon as we walked in, immediately we noticed it was waaaay to bright. I get the whole beach, ocean theme but if you didn't know any better, you would think the place was still under construction.  It was Friday evening & it was dead  if that tells you anything. Anyways, service was decent. We shared an order of nachos that came out as soon as we ordered them so clearly they just scoop shit out of a can. Nothing fresh or good about them. We ordered 15 wings, tried Fire & Ice, teriyaki, & buffalo parmesan medium. They were \"ok\". Flavor seemed pretty good but besides the teriyaki, they could have been crispier.  We ordered two fruity alcoholic drinks that were decent but for the price, they could have been in bigger glasses, less ice. Overall we didn't hate it but it definitely won't be a place we will go back to anytime soon. One more negative. I went to use the restroom & in the hallway, it smelled horrible. I guess it could have been from sulfur water but it smelled like someone tore up a restroom."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I am writing this as I sit at the table waiting for someone to ask me what I want to drink. I have been here for 31 minutes. At the 20 minute mark we asked a server that passed by and she said she would talk to someone.   I'm going to probably leave at the 40 minute mark. Not sure about the food but I'm not super impressed with the service...  ...Oh wow. A server just showed up to take our drink and food order. I guess the actual server went MIA. Doesn't seem like that should be my problem. Bad job so far. Might update this later if the food is decent. I ordered the all you can eat wings.   Update: It has been 16 minutes since the \"fill in server\" took our drink and food order. She came back to say that they only have one bartender tonight and the manager is stepping in behind the bar to help.   This place is ridiculous. They are not busy. I am literally looking at 5 other tables around me that have no people but still need to be cleaned. The tables around me got here after me but have already eaten some food but are looking for refills.   I have now been here for 54 minutes and haven't received my drink yet.  It has officially been 1 entire hour. The server JUST showed up with our drinks and 2 of them were wrong. The 6 of us have been talking about going to Hooters but I'm really interested in seeing how this awful place pans out.  67 minutes and 2 of 6 people's food has showed up. 1 of them is missing fries. The 2 drinks that were incorrect just showed up and are now correct. Please remember that this place isn't busy, it's just bad. I'll update when I get my food.   So I got my food at the 75 minute mark. 10 wings came out and I immediately smashed them because I was so hungry. I asked for a refill on the wings. The server came back at the 85 minute mark and informed us that..........you aren't going to believe it......seriously.....this can't happen........they ran out of wings! Then she let us know that she was sorry and that she talked to the manager and our bill would be comped. 2 tables near us also got their bill comped.   I don't see how this can happen. You are a wing place. The 1 thing you need to exist is wings. How?  97 minutes and still waiting for my second drink."}
{"text":"31 flavors off wings.  It's like the Baskin-Robbins of chicken.  They have either the sauce covered wings or the dry seasoning.  Some flavors were a hit or a miss.  I've tried the Medium Hurricane Sauce which has the familiar taste of tangy bar wings, Ancho Chile Lime Sauce dry, Firecracker Sauce dry, also not that great, and Smoky Citrus Chipotle which I thought was good.  The garlic parmesian fries weren't anything that I raved about.  The beers were only a $1 on draft because it's the NBA Finals.   They had friendly service, but sometimes forgot about orders when it wasn't that busy.  Just like the flavors of the wings, I believe that this place can be a hit or a miss for people."}
{"text":"Bar setting was very comfortable.  Nightly specials good value, we were there on a Thursday and had 1/2 price appetizers were good and reasonable priced.  Monday's daily special was a hamburger, which my husband had and it was good but any extras like cheese was an extra charge.  Overall all service was good, reasonable priced, food is average but love having a bar grill close that has $2 and $3 beer!  Outside patio is pleasant."}
{"text":"I went with my wife on a Friday night around 5pm.  The place was pretty empty, maybe 15-20 people in the place which isn't many as big as the restaurant is.  We were promptly seated, that's good!   I really wanted to like this place.  I did everything in my power to like this place.  I never actually got to try the food though.  We sat for at least 10 minutes and a waitress never came to take our drink order or even acknowledge we were there.  No smile, no \"I'll be right back\", no eye contact.  Nothing.  Three waitresses were hanging out flirting with the bartender and laughing the entire time.    Worse customer service I have experienced yet in the valley.  Trust me, the person who waited 40 minutes to place their order isn't exaggerating.  How is this place still in business?"}
{"text":"I really like coming to this place and trying new things. I have yet to try anything that I haven't liked. I love sitting out on the patio and chilling with a beer and a burger."}
{"text":"Greeted by a not so friendly hostess. Good less than average. Our server Lucky was very nice. Beyond that HORRIBLE! Won't return."}
{"text":"Our experience here was a great one. Cute place reminds me of those bars you find at the beach. Reasonable prices as well with weeknight specials. I had the fish and chips and thought It was delicious. My friend had a steak and enjoyed hers as well. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Well the food was good!  But the server was way outnumbered.  Poor management I suppose. There was one server for the entire place at 9:15 on a Saturday night and she had at least 10 tables inside and out. There was no way she could keep up. Cute decor. We might try again, but most of the complaints on Yelp are because of poor service. :("}
{"text":"We hadn't been to the Hurricane for a year, and won't go back. My husband ordered the shrimp quesadilla. He asked what came with it and the waitress, Sam, said tortilla chips, but he could pick a different side, so he asked for a salad. When we got the bill, he was charged additional for the salad. He asked if quacamole or salsa or sour cream came with the quesadilla and was told that would be an extra charge. When we got home we looked up the menu on-line and it says the quesadilla is served with salsa and sour cream.  I ordered the chicken chile chowder. When the waitress brought everyone's salad's, she told me they were out of the chicken chowder. This was 5:30 in the evening. But she said they had conch chowder. I'm not sure there were any conch in the soup, not a chowder, but it was good. Luckily I had ordered a side of coleslaw because the soup came in a very small bowl. The service was very slow. The waitress kept calling us honey, which is very irritating. And the food was overpriced for the serving size."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!  So many sauces, so little time, but the Coco Loco and the Maple Pepper are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"Spicy wings and sweet boozy drinks!  The sauce selection is really good, and the super-spicy sauce will knock you out of your chair.  The sort of stuff I can't resist, even if I really should.  Whatever, you only live once.  Some of the other reviewers complain about the service, but my table was served pretty promptly, even though the place was packed at the time."}
{"text":"First of all, this review is for the history books because when I went Saturday 3/26 they were Closed for Business (per the sign on the door).  Guess all the bad reviews did them in plus this whole area seems super-competitive for any restaurant.     I have been to several Hurricanes in South and Central FL so when I came here for job interview in January I came to this one.  Went back in March (after I started working here).  Food quality was same as the FL ones and I guess I lucked out with the service because both times it was decent.   Well, I guess no Hurricane for me in AZ anymore unless I decide to drive to Surprise (unlikely)."}
{"text":"Wings are excellent! Tried fish and steak too, steak was ok but not the greatest! This location needs to work on service! Too long of wait for attention from wait staff!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre is how I would describe my experience at Hurricane Grill. After looking over the menu, I was really craving the jerk chicken wings but come to find out they were out of jerk sauce. Disappointing. After that I decided I would try something really spicy so I went for the spiciest wings on the menu, the garlic inferno wings. They were spicy not crazy burn your lips off spicy but they definitely snuck up on me. They also had a sweet teriakyi vibe to them. The bone in chicken wings them self were just okay, very small and kind of dry. My fiance had the original hot buffalo sauce which was also just okay.  We also had an order of the bacon cheese fries which were good. We finished with a slice of chocolate cheesecake which was very disappointing. It literally tasted like the Hershey's chocolate pie that you can get at Burger King.  Service was okay. Drinks were not refilled which is very important when eating spicy food. Overall I just felt like everything tasted frozen and or pre-packaged. Just meh. I really didn't care for it. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and we had a horrible experience. Ashley was our waitress, she brought our drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. We asked her for a few minutes and 30 minutes later Ashley was no where in sight. We then asked another waitress if we could could get service. She told us she would have Ashley help us. Shortly after that Ashley walked right by our table not once but twice never saying a word to us. We decided then that we were leaving.  We have never left a restaurant mad but our waitress was the worst one we've ever had.  To bad for her because that place is only a couple of miles from our house and my husband always tips 25 to 30%."}
{"text":"Their wings are incredible I highly recommend them. The place has a cool beachy vibe and was clean"}
{"text":"Good wings, excellent attentive service. First time trying it, heard about the wings. We'd they have  50 cent boneless wings till 8pm and then all wings are 50 cents. Tried the honey garlic and really enjoyed em. Sampled the Jamaican jerk and trifecta as well. Our server Jennifer and she did amazing! Will be back for the wings and other menu items. Wanted to try everything!"}
{"text":"Great Service from moment we walked in Hamburger, Wings & Grilled Chicken Mmmmmm Good"}
{"text":"If you like boneless wings with a million sauce options this is a Buffalo Wild Wings alternative for you.  The husband and i decided to try out Hurricane's a few weeks ago and meh is all I can really say. My husband appreciated the fact that they were able to make a proper buffalo chicken sandwich (chicken breast is completely tossed in wing sauce) but I was left questioning whether or not the chicken in their chicken chili was really chicken- or pressed chicken pieces with chicken flavoring. The service was ok but like the food, nothing to write home about.  If dragged here again I would probably go with the intention to drink- not eat."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took forever to get a server. Wings were undercooked. Won't come back"}
{"text":"Sitting here Sunday afternoon of Labor Day weekend.  Came because they have buzztime trivia,  and we were in the area. Great craft beer selections for us.  Had grouper sliders, and they were delish and huge. Like this place."}
{"text":"I just experienced the worse lunch ever!!  The waitress  Ashley was very nicest.  I'm talking about the cleanlyness & food itself.  One of my friends & I ordered the Hurricane chicken salad. To start with It came out looking nothing like the picture in the menue.  Very small, i mean side salad small.  The tomato pieces were so small it looked like they were minced as were any other vegetables that were included.  When we touched the salt & pepper containers, they were very dirty.  The Chicken had been cooked before and reheated.  Tough as nails.  We actually only tried to a few pieces before moving them to the side & informing the waitress.  The kitchen, only gave us a discount at the end of the meal.  So, I'm still hungry. My friend that encouraged us to eat there said, \"It was cleaner inside\". Why should it be cleaner in one area or another in a resturant?"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Hurricane Grill on Valentines for dinner.  Overall we had a better then average experience and will be coming back.  The place was pretty full with tons of TVs and various games for all sports fans.  The drink specials were plentiful and reasonably priced.  As far as the food goes.  The menu has a tropical beach feel, but with a wide verity for all tastes.  My choice was the pulled pork quesadilla and cyclone sauce on the side. The pork was tender, flavorful, and not overly salty.  The sauce packed plenty of flavor, but not as hot as I thought it would be.  The only real down side, and the reason for the one star deduction, was that it was very greasy. Other then that, the staff was pleasant and prompt.  We might not go back on a regular basis, but we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were seated at the center of the restaurant. You had to actively avoid eye contact to not see us there. There were only 4 other tables and 7 servers/hosts chatting at the host stand. Waited 30 minutes without being acknowledged (we waited a little longer because we knew it was a new restaurant). Finally had to leave."}
{"text":"CLOSED. Not surprised. Not sure how they stayed in business that long. High prices, questionable hold times with food not hot, and service slower than molasses in January. Forget this place."}
{"text":"Darn !!!! I hoped it would be good! I walked in the decor was super cool. The service was terrible!!! I have no complaints about the food. it's slightly better than average bar food. The service was bad from the get go! I watched 3 party's wait 5 min to be seated in an empty restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is awesome they have TVs everywhere great staff the bartender is awesome he helped us with the menu as this was our first time here he made sure we were taken care of he was on top of things and he made some great reccommendations they have ice cold beer on tap great service and there wings are amazing with so many different flavors to choose from. I can't wait to try there burgers. We will be back."}
{"text":"I am an avid wing lover and this place has great wings. Their choices of sauces is about 40 and they're so good. I love their garlic Parmesan fries! Everytime I go the service is amazing all the servers are so kind and fun. The bartenders are a good time and make some tasty drinks. They usually have good music unless it's Sunday then the games are one. Usually great deals on Sunday for pitchers and mimosas and margaritas for us ladies. They have ladies night on Wednesday in which they have 1-3 dollar shots! Sometimes they have a band and it's a really great atmosphere. The management is kind and fun. I really hope this place stays open here!"}
{"text":"Another place turning the cheap wing into something expensive. Other than that the food and well drinks were OK and priced as you would find at most local bars. I was disappointed when they told me one of my flavors they were out of but with that many flavors it not hard to find a replacement. 5 levels of heat count as 5 different sauces so they really only have about 20 flavors."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim and this place is now one of our go to wing places. Great wings and love getting what they have on tap. Mostly get an ipa"}
{"text":"Great prices on wings, great beer and liquor prices. Bartenders are awesome. Over 32 flavors and rubs... and you can mix them"}
{"text":"What's not to love about 34 flavors of wings? Like ice cream gone chicken....some of the more memorable (and tasty) wings I've ever enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Felt food was not as good as my last time. Had tacos they were dry and lacking flavor. First beer was flat. Server was great."}
{"text":"Went to Hurricanes tonight and had a wonderful experience. There was live music, great specials, and we had a wonderful server. T.J. made sure we had everything we needed and, even though it was a very busy night, he a made us feel like we were his only table. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The wings here are awesome! The service is great! This is a cool place where people at the bar are friendly and get to know each other!  My husband and I enjoyed many good times here during our winter stay in Arizona.  The employees make the atmosphere good here. Just fun!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Atmosphere is colorful, airy, happy. The happy hour is until 7pm!! The firecracker tacos are a flavor sensation. I had a carribean style side salad that was excellent. Attentive and fast service. I also ordered a \"lime in the coconut\" drink that was smooth and perfectly made. I will be back!! Our server was Cole. But several folks checked on us too. Great customer service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I was SO excited for this place to open. I've only been in once, but I was pretty disappointed. The service was great, the inside is good with lots of seating and lots of tv's to watch sports, but the food?? I was not impressed! I first ordered the buffalo chicken bruschetta, we had to send it back because it was so bad (we still had to pay for it when we didn't even eat any of it) I then ordered the steak taquitos, better than the bruschetta but not still not great, it was so bland and boring. My husband ordered the wings, which he enjoyed and said that they were a great size. Next time I'm definitely sticking with be wings!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Appetizers are good. Average prices. Ok place. Inside bar with tables for dining. Outside patio for eating. No smoking!  When I go out with my smoking friends, we like the outside patios for smoking. Not a good match for me."}
{"text":"Great food and wings. Looks great inside. Great TVs. Def will be back, especially during football. Staff was nice and helpful, not sure what others are complaining about. Patio is awesome. Sliders were great, wing sauce was great, plenty of sauce options. Awesome menu too; tons of great stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered the sampler appetizer and asked for double boneless wings instead of shrimp bc I hate seafood. Waited quite a while for the food. When it came out I questioned whether I got double chicken wings bc it looked like a normal order but the bartender insisted it was \"based off weight and shrimp is lighter.\" Upon starting to eat, my food was cold. Not even warm, just cold. Keep in mind- the restaurant had a total of 4 parties!! No reason to get cold food!! The bartender said he would get me a new order which I thanked him for doing for me. When I got the new order, he forgot I asked for no shrimp.. Here's the kicker: I GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF BONELESS CHICKEN WINGS as I did when I asked for no shrimp even though the second plate had shrimp. The food was mediocre at best. Over priced. Bartender didn't know prices or if food was on happy hour.. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We had their hamburger special. The meat was great but the bun was soggy.  We ordered onion rings.  Can you believe we got 6 rings for $3.49. Pricey don't you think? Very upsetting."}
{"text":"Great service! People are friendly! Healthy food choices! Great drink choices! Fun place for friends and family!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the salads at this place! The menu is fantastic and the food quality is super consistent! And that's consistently amazing. The drinks and drink specials are just what we need for happy hour and the wait staff and management are super friendly and attentive! We are almost \"regulars\" at this point!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is being written one hour after arriving on Mondays wing night. The wings we ordered still are not out. Can't comment on the food because it still isn't here. It isn't packed. Luckily they were able to refill our drinks twice so that they can jack up our tab. Not happy."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes, I even joined their frequent diner club.  I've been there 3 times cause I do have a 3 strike policy before I completely write off a restaurant.  The first 2 times were terrible.  I waited FOR EVER just to get a drink and order food when the bar was empty, maybe 4 others along the bar with full drinks but THAT'S IT!  I tried to figure it all out but my best guess was that it was shift change and found out that WAS the case cause the female bartender wanted her tip and for me to close out my tab only to reopen it with the next bartender.  That's so annoying.  My third time there was a little better and I got to try their food for a 2nd time.  Wings are just SO-SO.  They lack on the sauciness of the wings and need to learn that when the wings start floating, take them out.  As you can probably tell, I'll probably not go back any time soon.  I'd much rather hop over to Fridays or across the street to Panini's.  Such a shame too.  Location, location, location."}
{"text":"It was amazing. We both had tacos. I had fish with fries on them and a really tasty sauce. My husband had pork with the same fries and sauce. Very good. We ordered a fried avocado with beans corn and salsa. It was better than I thought it would be. Joined their rewards club cause we will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner tonight and were pleasantly surprised with the whole thing environment, staff, prices and food.  We ordered the parmesan cheese fries appetizer and the chicken tender sampler platter.  The platter gives you a chance to try four of their 34 different sauces and they also let you make up your own by combining some; try the BBQ mixed with the Habanero Lime Toss.  The fries were very good and the chicken was tender.  They had a decent amount of TV's and were strategically placed where everyone gets a peek.  My wife and I started a check list of the sauces so we can try them all.  For sure coming back..."}
{"text":"The basketball finals are on - we're thinking wings and our ass planted in front of the TV at home.  So, we figure with Hurricane Grill & Wings advertising like mad about their 31 flavors, why not give it a try?  We walk in just as the game is starting and take a look at the menu.  The hard part really is deciding what flavors you want - we went for their Hurricane Wing Flavor Sample for $17.99.  It comes with 24 pieces of their jumbo wings or boneless wings, tossed with four sauces of your choice, celery, and ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  It took about half an hour for our order to go to finally come out.  We weren't the only one waiting though.  A bunch of people had called in their orders, and they weren't particularly pleased with the wait either.  Meanwhile, I'm watching the dynamics of this place - they're trying to train a new girl, but I don't think they are doing a very good job of it.  The bar is REALLY close to where the tables are.  Therefore, if you plan on bringing your kids to this place, watch out for the foul- mouth drunks hanging out at the bar.  Dropping the F bomb every other second can be described as a not family-friendly environment.  The good thing about taking it to go is that they label each box with what flavor you got.  The bad thing is that they don't bother asking if you want ranch or bleu cheese, they just give you the ranch.  And the celery includes four pieces.  Also, we saw someone else get hot sauce for their to go order, so we were sure to ask for some of that too.  Our flavor choices:   * Sea Salt & Vinegar - We really couldn't taste the whole salt and vinegar concept, just tasted like deep-fried wings. Lacking in overall taste.  * Ancho Chile Lime Sauce - Good flavor with a nice heat as well.  * Habanero Lime Toss - A dry rub - nice heat as well, with a fresh squeeze of lime on top.  * Hurricane's Garlic & Parmesan - Pretty good flavor with the cheese adding the funky smell and taste.  With wings, the BF loves Wing Stop.  My complaint with them is that their wings are too small, good flavor though.  Here - the wings are bigger with more meat and good flavors, if you choose the right ones.  I was dipping my wings in the ranch, bleu cheese, and hot sauce, so maybe there wasn't enough flavor for me.  Sometimes they don't have all the flavors available though as we heard they were out of a few.   Overall, we'd go back.  But the wait alone sucked and I don't about dining in since the service seemed lacking.  Their Garlic Parmesan Fries ($3.99) look tempting though!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but too expensive. $76 for three of us. Over a dollar per wing, just way too much. Service is slow at best. Had to grab other servers to ask for service. No complaints about the food but can get the same quality elsewhere for much less $. Rice was dry and I just took one bite. Both cabbage salads were not good. The appetizer of fries, fried pickles, shrimp and boneless wings was disappointing. The only thing that was good was the honey garlic sauce. So close to being good but just missing the mark. Price is just way too high for the taste."}
{"text":"Had lunch so it was quiet and not crowded. Our servers were great. The food was delicious. The chicken wrap is a little spicy and tasty. The pork sliders with honey bbq were yummy. Next time we will try their wings. It's a sports bar so TVs around the room. Love the beach/surf atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another stop on the Arizona foodie trek. Below is a pic of todays lunch. Fried Chicken breast instead of a burger on a bun. Topped off with some honey mustard sauce. The menu looked inviting and the food was good. For lunch time, not a crowd at all. Full service bar inside along with outdoor patio seating with a perfect veiw of a massive water fountain. Considering how slow it was, the wait for the food was a wee bit longer than expected however all of our food came out at the same time"}
{"text":"I have been to Hurricane Grill several times though out the years. I stopped going after the service started going down hill. That has all changed. They have a whole new staff with excellent service now. Food is still as good as it was and there are new items on the menu. Johnathan was our waiter and he was very attentive. We never wanted for anything and he kept our table clean. He is AWESOME. I have another group of friends I go there with and I will going back soon with them to experience the improvement. Thanks for making this a great place."}
{"text":"2:30 in the afternoon is probably not the best time to visit since it's between meal times, but we really felt like having an afternoon pick-me-up of some coffee but server said there wasn't any and she'd have to make some, and sure enough we had to wait an inordinate amt. of time for it but thankfully got it 1/2 way through our meal, and it was really good coffee, but then she had to make another trip to bring the creamer. Then when we wanted refills, we again had to wait, and she again had to go back for creamers. We ordered the firecracker tacos and the fish and chip tacos. An order consists of two of each and some taco chips and salsa--chips very bland. No choice of corn or flour taco--all on menu were flour except for one, which is certainly disappointing when tacos take up a chunk of their menu. My firecracker taco had some zip to it but friend's fish taco and fries had almost an old oil taste. Server was complaining to another table that she's usually at the bar, so that might be the reason she just wasn't very attentive and at one point walked away, oblivious to the fact that I was asking her a question about Happy Hour.  Name of Hurricane Grill and lovely seascape murals around the restaurant would lead one to believe there might be some island music or a bit of Jimmy Buffet, but all that was playing that afternoon was C & W music cranked up to Happy Hour noise level so had to strain to hear each other converse. Was very glad we came in on a BOGO coupon or we would've been far more disappointed. From reading the reviews I see there is a rewards club, but it wasn't mentioned to us. Noticed they had some draft beers I'd like to try, so will probably return during Happy Hour and then try the wings and hope all will be much better since after all Wings is supposed to be their Things."}
{"text":"Started out good....BUT...  The wings were really good, the drink specials were good.....everything after that went downhill. Almost bait and switch.  Service was meh. Food after wings was blech. Two sides were delivered wrong. Steak philly..oi. The peppers and onions almost non-existent. Steak was dry. Cheese was plastic-like, the roll had been obviously microwaved...couldn't even chew some portions. Server was nowhere to be found when we needed to leave. Getting a drink was like pulling teeth.   But, hey, if you're going for drinks and wings and not in a hurry, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner while we visited the monthly car show.  Enjoyed the wings and my wife had a hamburger.  Nice seating area inside and they have a outdoor sitting area, right near the fountain.  Will go back agin, reasonable priced selections."}
{"text":"Please see my previous review from 8/7/15 wherein I swore to never come back here again.  It took my husband over 18 months to get my to relent and try again.  Guess what.... I'm never coming back here again.   In front of me the hostess told a server to take care of table 64 because \"that lady makes me want to stab her.\"  She sat us in the sun because otherwise it would mess up the server rotation.  We moved after she walked away.    Guy brought his dog, sat next to the door and tied his dog to the door handle.  Dog stands in middle of doorway which scares some.  It licked empty app plates being carried out and the server still took those to the table.  Multiple servers and staff petted the dog and headed straight to the kitchen...I am going to assume to wash their hands.    And if all that wasn't enough they changed the fish, it's not as good as it was in 2015 and guess what now it's not all you can eat and every extra piece is $2.   LOL.  Now my hubby is done too!    To be fair our server was awesome but that's not enough too bring us back."}
{"text":"4+ for me. We keep going back week after week, and take our family there. The place is REALLY popular with the 50+ population. I really like the the Jamaican Jerk sauce, and have to say it's probably my favorite. This is our #1 place for wings, bar food and cold beer."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff.   Had a shrimp bowl that was delightful.   Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I completely understand new places having some growing pains and the introductory period with ups and downs but this place just isn't very good. I work in the business so I know what to expect at a new place (slow service,longer wait times,possible mistakes) but my reason for the 2 star review has nothing to do with those things.. I wasn't expecting a five star cuisine as a know this was a chain. Me and my girlfriend got a $5 off welcome coupon in the mail so we thought we would try it out for happy hour. Waitress comes over seems nervous that's totally fine and expected, I ask what draft beers they have she only knows about 3... I'm not expecting you to have them all memorized but wouldn't you want to have that all written down seeing that your a sports bar? Not a huge deal but a little frustrating having to wait for the back and forth and her finding out what beers they have. Then I ask what their happy hour specials they have. Doesn't know.... Something else I would think they would be teaching in training. These are just basic server things you should know and has nothing to do with it being a new place. Next the food not very good.. I had steak taquitos appetizer steak was chewy and dry it looked like they just slapped a bunch of cheese on top and it wasn't super busy either.. I got the sliders as an entree they weren't terrible but they weren't good either. In terms of the time the food took it wasn't long at all so that's a plus but it just wasn't very good also for happy hour beer $4 is nothing that would keep me going their solely for that purpose as their are better places in the area for happy hour. Overall just not very good"}
{"text":"I am NOT kidding people!!! If you like fish fry (even if you don't typically), you HAVE to order the Yearling fish fry!! It is HUGE and THE best fish fry I have ever, ever, EVER eaten!!! In fact, it is so good that every single family member (dad, brother, sister, brother-in-law, husband, kid, nieces and myself) orders it and it is the ONLY place we all order the same thing!!   It is just so AMAZING!!!! The other food is worthy, but once you order the Yearling fish fry, you probably will NEVER order anything else!! In fact, if you are like me, you will need your fix on a regular basis!!!!  Don't forget to ask for tarter sauce!! It is exceptionally good, and they don't drop it off without a request!  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"Good wings. For some reason they weren't hot off grill per say. It's kinda a boring atmosphere. Not something I would actively try to go to, but I would not say no to it. Could be more of a sports bar. Not really sure what they are going for. Good but not really good."}
{"text":"PROs: Food was excellent! I had the tilapia with rice and broccoli. My wife had the fish and chips and they were great as well.  Had a really nice draft beer selection and there speciality cocktails were well made. Clean restrooms and lots of big TVs.   CONs: I understand the concept is South Florida-ish but it's color scheme is like a kids beach playhouse. Our server was very nice and informative, but she only came by every 10 mins or so. We had to wait a lil bit to keep the dinner/drink flow going. The atmosphere for a Sat night during the Elite 8 basketball tournament was LAME! There was almost as many customers as staff members.   I would come here if your staying in a near by hotel and tired of driving. Other than that, take a 15 min road trip to something more vibrant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone way down hill. The food is disgusting and the customer service is atrocious. The bartender needs to be taught how to deal with customers. I ordered boneless wings to go and received old, dry chicken tenders with sauce in a cup. It's a shame I live right across the street because I'll never return."}
{"text":"I like the food that I've had from Hurricane Grill. This evening, I had the mahi-mahi with a jabenero rub and a side of carribean rice and a side of garlic broccoli. They had a nice band on Friday that was fun to listen to. I was tempted to get the Friday fish fry but, I decided to have the other meal instead. I wish there were a couple more locations around Glendale or Phoenix. They have plenty of parking and a patio for the cooler months."}
{"text":"Service is generally slow.  Their Jamaican jerk chicken is awful. I've also gotten weird grisly bites of chicken...  They do have some good flavors, but overall I was un-impressed.  They also have a number of wobbly tables."}
{"text":"They have 30 sauces for their wings and tenders. I had the hot BBQ and Huricane hot sauce on my boneless wings. It was delish!!! The service was friendly and attentive. They have NFL Ticket, so it's a great place to chill on Sunday. They even put on the 49ers game outside for me!!"}
{"text":"This place just plain sucks.  Bad management and awful service."}
{"text":"We love to come here whenever we visit Arizona. It's a fun atmosphere and the service is great. The only bad thing is trying to decide what to order because it's all so good!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THESE WINGS!!! 30-something different flavors!!!!!  I have dined here 6 times now and every time I have really enjoyed all the food. I have actually turned 5 different people into regulars at this joint, just by taking them there once.   We always start out with the garlic-parmesan fries. Pure artery clogging goodness. I actually feel my blood thicken as I eat them.   We then usually get the wing sampler which lets you choose 4 different flavors. The wings are jumbo wings not those little pinkie finger sized wings you get at some joints. These babies are more like mini drum sticks. They have flavors ranging from Mild and Sweet to Ridiculously Hot.   Check this place out if you like excellent flavorful food ( Full menu on their website)....defiantly worth it. Also there are a few locations this one is just the one closest to my house.   This place gets 5 stars for great service, awesome wings, and a FULL BAR."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Conch soup. Salad needed more inspiration but service had been great. Gamers next table were a hoot and fantastic surprise!!! Chandler finally has character!!!"}
{"text":"Great Gluten free menu with lots of options including gluten free buns. Mon special is 1/2 lb hamburger for 4.99. Excellent. Be prepared to take your time as service is slow. Sitting on the patio in this weather is great"}
{"text":"Went there with a few buddies the other week on football Sunday. Wings were ok but extremely over priced. Waited a longtime for the order as well. Bucket of beers was reasonable.   It's going to be tough for them to complete against Native New Yorker when they do $.49 wings on Sunday. I would of paid half the price for better wings if I would of gone there."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the new place in the hood and try the wings.  For a dollar a wing, they were quite disappointing.  CK's down the street has wings of similar quality for .40 cents less  during regular hours and .60 cents per wing on happy hour.  I guess they need to pay for the televisions and new decorations in the place.  Beers were a little pricey as well given the location.  Heard that the owner of the property is the father of the guy who previously launched a place there so that may reflect that and affect the prices.  Poor business planning. Not likely to come back.  Should develop a better\winning approach.  Available for consulting as needed.  Server was nice but overall experience did not meet the hype.  Anyone's guess as to what will occupy this place next."}
{"text":"First of all, they aren't doing happy hour appetizers... Stupid... Why ADVERTISE a happy hour?  Secondly, the wings are so dry! They aren't that big either...  Thirdly, the Garlic Parmesan fries are cold, hard, and soggy, even the replacement order we got... The food just isn't good at all :-/  Fourth, it's sooooo sooooo loud you can't have a conversation  Their saving grace? The people are very friendly...  Good luck staying alive...!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this local restaurant.  The atmosphere was clean and we were seated right away.  I asked the waitress about a particular drink and said I didn't want anything too sweet.  She recommended a drink and when I got it it was extremely sweet.  She was very nice and said she would replace it.  I ordered a chardonney.  I got a red wine.   Told her chardonney, she brought me a sweet Moscato.  I went to the bar and got the correct drink.  In the meantime, a singer on the patio, Chicago Dave, was tormenting us with his music.  It seemed the longer he sang, the worse he got and louder he got!  The waitress said he was worse than the band the previous night.   The food was actually quite good.  The wings were tasty and service was good, except for the wine mixup.  We asked for the bill and  we found they overcharged us for the sides.  The bill was adjusted when it was brought to her attention.  We rushed out in order to escape the screeching on the patio!"}
