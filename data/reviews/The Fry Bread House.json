{"text":"Service has never been good, but the food was good. So I wanted to try the new location on East Indian School Rd.  The service was so terrible I will not go back. You place your order at the counter. It took over 30 minutes to bring me out my order and then they forgot the hot sauce. They have an interesting way of bringing out your food... someone goes up and down the aisles calling out your name until they find the correct person. One medium size green chile burro, a tiny amount of rice, and a small coke was 12$. There was also someone who looked homeless cleaning off the tables. Most of the tables still had food crumbs on them. The building is big, but is a mess inside and out."}
{"text":"How can something so simple taste sooo good? I wish there were one more on the west side. I hate going to the fair to get my fix of fry bread. There needs to be one of these on every  corner of the compass in Phoenix! As Rachel Ray would say, \"Yummy!\""}
{"text":"While I love that it is Native American owned and operated, the best thing about this restaurant is the food - as it should be.  I don't go out to eat to be entertained or charmed - just fed better than I could be at home and that is exactly what this place does.  

The food is amazing. The fry bread isn't greasy and I don't know how they do that.  The meals are flavorful, filling, and reasonably priced.  The only thing I would do is add some tomatoes to the tacos but that is a minor quibble.  

If you want to go out for a delicious meal in a casual place and not pay a lot for it, GO NOW to the Fry Bread House."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best fry bread and green or red chili you are going to get in the state. They're not trying to sell you on the customer service, it's there amazing, ridiculously delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ideal for the taste of home for fellow Natives in the area. Downside there is no ventilation inside in the restaurant; hot and a little humid. Customer service could be improved.  Overall if you need your frybread fix in the city this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"Most large cities have their unique cuisine:
Go to New York - get the pizza or a Coney Island Dog.
Go to Chicago - get the deep dish pizza.
Go to New Orleans - get the jambalaya and the gumbo.
Go to Boston - get the lobster.
Go to Philadelphia - get a cheese steak sandwich.
Come to Phoenix - get Indian Fry Bread.

Maybe you've seen fry bread at a carnival served with powdered sugar, cinnamon, and honey. That's a good dish but there's so much more to this Navajo specialty. I like it served as a beef taco but there are a number of variations with and without meat.

Unfortunately I don't get here as often as I'd like but when I do come I'm never disappointed (OK, the service can be a bit sketchy)."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian.....you must try the veggie taco. The mountain of goodness atop the tasty fry bread will leave your belly too full, but your mouth will definitely want more. This is a great spot for a a mixed herbivore/carnivore lunch stop, as my non-veggie friends can't seem to get enough of the red or green chili tacos. I am much looking forward to returning to try the honey fry bread desert, as I have never had room for desert after the massive tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Frybread was good and the green chili traditional. Will come back again and again"}
{"text":"Huge fry bread tacos, really great green chile. Prices reasonable and location is alright. Nachos were good, and the fry bread in general was delicious. Portion sizes are quite large, keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Delicious and different! We'd never had fry bread and as our first experience this was a treat! The restaurant is cute and the service is fast. There were folks who stopped by for lunch and got in and out quickly. I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good fry bread I get the red chille with beans and cheese, I just hope they stay put this time and not move ... But the food is awesome I recommend it"}
{"text":"Green Chili Stew is intense and fantastic! If you can handle spicy foods- I would say that this is a must try! Only knock on this place is that it is tiny and not ventilated very well. There is a lot of grease trapped inside of this small restaurant, and you will smell like fry bread for the rest of the day. That being said, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Ok food is pretty good. So why the two stars. $30 for 2 adults and a kid. Service is horrible. The place smells like sewer back up so bad it makes you sick. It is not worth the $30 to go to this place.  I am just not sure why the great rating. Like I said food was good but over priced. Add in the environment and this is not a great place."}
{"text":"I have a natrual affinity for grease...so reading the reviews, I had one of those \"aha\" moment...square peg, square hole.

But..(sorrowful violin in the background)...me and FBH...we just weren't meant to be...I was looking for a bit more crisp in my deepfry relationship...while FHB had that mysterious salty yeasty flavor that I didn't even know that I was looking for...it was seriously lacking that soul-filling crispiness that break against my teeth on first bite before falling into pillowy steaming breadiness

Conclusion:  Definitely worth a try if you haven't had fry bread before.
Now that I tried it...I'd go back if I'm in the area...but personally not something that I would drive out of my way for."}
{"text":"This place was such a treat to find. I was passing by through Arizona and we decided to stop in Phoenix for lunch. When we searched for Native American food, this appealed to us. First, you're greeted by a nice and hilariously sarcastic owner. I was a little worried when I saw one of the cooks in the corner, eating McDonald's though! lol

We got the green chili and red chili with the fry bread. The fry bread is about the size of a small pizza. Its hot, fluffy, pretty decadent, and super yummy. The green chili was more mild and less chunky than the red chili, but still good. Its good for people who want chili but do not want a spicy one. 

But the red chili was out of this world! Deep packed with flavor, chunky, the right amount of spice. 

The place is casual and will definitely make a visit back when we come this way. We took a quart home. We also had the butter and chocolate fry bread, which is their sweet specialty. The chocolate kind of tasted like middle quality fondue chocolate. The real star of the dessert was actually just the fry bread itself though. I have yet to taste the tacos but they look huge!"}
{"text":"My older sister kept raving about this place and by kept raving about this place I axed her to stop talking about it because she kept putting it on higher pedestals and I feel that things shouldn't be built up so much.  She stopped talking about it until after I finally told her I went and man, was it worth all that hype.
I went to Phoenix to see the White Sox take on the Diamondbacks and I flew in that Friday morning.  After I got to the hotel I quickly found my way to the light rail which took me north to Indian School Road.  And then I caught a bus for a quick slide over to 7th avenue.  I ordered a red taco AND a green taco thinking that they weren't too big but perhaps I should have paid attention to what was on other people's plates.  They were both really, really good and if I had to pick a better one, I'd say that the red chili was slightly better than the green.
The red tamale was OUTSTANDING and next time I go in there I'm a gonna order at least 5 of those.  Did you read that last sentence?  I repeat, the red tamale was OUTSTANDING.
The inside of the place wasn't much to look at but if your food is that good, then who really gives a fuck what the decor looks like?

Helpful tip:  Go there really hungry."}
{"text":"Oh my God...Oh my God...I feel the heart attack coming...Ahhhh....and it is so worth it!! 

This place has all of the tasty, greasy goodness one needs to complete a day, or week, or month for that matter. The Fry bread is made fresh and you can most certainly taste it. Again, it is definitely greasy, so if you are on a health trip, you may want to avoid this place. For the rest of us, who indulge, this is worth every pound. 

The meat was cooked perfectly. The sour cream was abundantly present. The cheese was in all the right places (everywhere). And the fry bread was greasy, crunchy, and light all at the same time. Not sure how they pull it off, but they do. 

I would suggest to go there for lunch for the following reasons: 

-a wonderful break from work 
-leaves you in a food coma, meaning that the rest of work with fly by 
-it gives you the rest of the day to work the grease off 
-just makes the day better!"}
{"text":"If a doughnut and a giant taco had a baby they would top it with green chiles and name it \"deliciousness\".

Seriously bomb veggie fry bread taco. The Fry Bread House is a  fantastic cultural experience for any visitor willing to indulge in the delights of southwestern cuisine."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews of Phoenix area Yelpers...

The parking lot is pretty small - maybe enough for around 10 cars, but I found a spot even at 12pm.  There are probably 25-30 seats available in the restaurant itself.  Looks like there are quite a few people who order to-go.

I had the regular old green chili fry bread taco - it came with beef in a sauce, lettuce, and shredded cheddar cheese on top on a deep fried bread.  It was very good.  The beef was tender and not chewy or rubbery at all.  Good thing they give you a fork and knife because I don't think it's possible to eat the taco without it falling apart with the sauce.

I probably took a year off my life with all that grease, cholesterol, and fat, but it was definitely work it. I would come back here if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"What more can be said about TFH ? The food is great.  My only complaint would be the size of the location needs to be 10 times bigger. They also  need to add another location WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF MY HOUSE !!!!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for uniqueness and yumminess!  Had the green chili fry bread taco. So good!  Everything you've read before is true: very greasy and heavy. But I deem it a \"must do\" if not for the blind pleasure of fried food, but for the unique \"cultural culinary adventure.\"

I came here by myself so didn't have anyone to split a dessert fry bread with :-("}
{"text":"Clean dining area, not too fancy. Great if you have kids and need to feed them fast. 
Get the Indian taco with the beef! Yum! The desert was the highlight, deep fried bread with cinnamon sugar. Ugh! I wasn't hungry for the next 12 hours..."}
{"text":"Ever since my visit to the AZ state fair as a child, I've had a weakness for fry bread.

I loved everything about this place -- from the local papers about Indian reservation events to the chit chat with the guy behind the counter about which Navajo tribe managed the restaurant -- and I recommend it to anyone visiting the greater Phoenix area.

Personally, I like fry bread \"as is\", particularly after a quick dip in the red beef chile or hominy beef stew, but those wanting something with a bit more pizazz can order a wide array of sweet or savor toppings (cheese, honey, cinnamon, powered sugar, chocolate, beans, etc)

When I visited the first time, I had the red beef chile stew early in the day and later returned later that evening with a friend to have the hominy beef stew.  By the time we finished, the place had long closed, and the owners were cool about politely waiting until we finished."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time we went but this place was packed! Maybe that is saying something about the place but I'm never going after the Fiesta Bowl Parade again.  lol.  But the food was great! The Indian Taco I ordered was huge.  I suggested to my bf and bf's parents that they should expand.  Wanna go again...but maybe in the middle of the week when it's not so busy for such a small place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my by a friend and all I have to say is WOW.  The bread was light and filling and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best fry bread ever.  The tacos are excellent and the powered sugar dessert fry breads are wonderful and light.  They also make really good iced sun tea.  

Like that this place is low-key and casual."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the new location, it's been awhile since going to FBH and I wasn't aware they had moved.  The spacious new digs are a big improvement over the moderately squeezed 7th avenue spot, especially the parking.  Although I went in for a take-out order, I could appreciate the huge dining room where you wouldn't have to sit right on top of somebody.  If you go there for anything else than the food you might find it a little 'sterile', but of course the food is everything.  

I was greeted by a cashier, she was exceptionally nice and made me feel welcome.  Opting for my favorite, I ordered the bean (whole bean) and cheese fry bread.  My order was ready in about 10 minutes and I headed for home (7 miles) where I found the meal was still hot.  

FBH knows how to cook beans; they are the best in the city and prepared to perfection.  They don't skimp, the cheese is the real deal and the fry bread is divinity - as advertised.  Add-in their supplied homemade hot sauce and you've got a delicious 'homemade' meal.  The only thing I could compare it to was a favorite meal my mother used to make many years ago - cornbread and beans.  This Indian-style version of that meal certainly tastes homemade to me.  

Let's hope the expanded version of FBH brings them much success.  For the uniqueness and quality of their food at bargain prices - they've earned it.  FBH is scheduled to move once again to the southeast corner of 7th Avenue and Hazelwood, about 5 blocks south of Camelback."}
{"text":"The dessert fry bread with honey and powder sugar is amazing! I highly recommend it. The shredded beef taco is pretty good too. The service is okay and the location isn't the best, but the fry  bread makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Boys loved the fry bread kids meals and I had the green beef taco. A may zing! Everybody was really nice and the place seems clean and the food well prepared.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good hole in the wall! I'm going to try the Ultimate next time, I felt the beef taco would be better with beans :P"}
{"text":"Hey, want something SO GOOD??

So good you will want to ignore your doctor's advice and eat there every day!?   Something that will make you weak in the knees and leave you begging for more?

Go. To. The Fry Bread House. GO. Now.

If you know native american fry bread, if you don't, doesn't matter. This place rocks. They have an assortment of native style dishes, like the red or green chili stew (that come with or without the bread - but puh-leeeeeze get the bread) and mexican/indian type things. Today I had the indian taco; re-fried beans, cheese and lettuce wrapped in, what was that? Deep fried flipping nirvana-esque bread did you say? Oh hell yes. And the salsa is pretty good too. 

Then just to make sure I would require an ambulance ride home complete with frequent use of the defibrillator, we topped it all off with fry bread covered in honey. Oh my god, my mouth is watering. If you live Az, if you are planning to visit, just make sure you stop by. I promise you won't be sad you did.

Ok, I think I have rambled enough and hope that you all understand, that uhhmm, I really really really really like fry bread!!!"}
{"text":"Hi, Nathan, thank you so much for talking to me today about the avalibility new location in South Scottsdale. I've been to your restaurant several times and I'm excited for the possibility of you aquiring the space next door to my barbershop. I've been on this corner for over 40 years, with a senior center across the street, the General Dynamics Research Plant on the other side, and the Salt River Indian Reservation on the East side. Including the densely populated neighborhood. It is sure to be a winner.

P.S. It is a great location!"}
{"text":"This is the best fry bread I have ever tried, hands down! It is slightly crunchy, light, and a bit chewy- literally the most perfect! Also, the portions are huge! I ate half a taco for dinner and enjoyed the rest for lunch the next day. As far as ambiance, I love the way this restaurant is laid out- the lines feel very clean and uncluttered, thanks to their unique use of ropes to demarcate the order line. Their string lighting is very kitschy and adds an artistic flair that balances out the modern feel of the space.  The food and ambiance makes me want to bring g everyone I know here- thanks Fry Bread House!"}
{"text":"This placed moved to 4545 n. 7thavenue. Wrote this before but someone changed it again."}
{"text":"Not too much to say here. Went to the Fry Bread House for lunch and got a Green Chili Indian Taco. Inexpensive, came out of the kitchen in about seven minutes, huge, and absolutely delicious. Dining area is clean, staff is friendly, food is very tasty (if not the healthiest in the world...), and service is fast. The only con is the dining area is very small so you can feel packed in. 

Overall, the Fry Bread House is a great little local place to go to if you ever want some fast, delicious food at a low price!"}
{"text":"Delicious!
FYI: it moved to 1003 E. Indian School Rd.
I had the spicy red chili beef taco and it was awesome!
The ordering part is a little unorganized but I assume they are still working out the kinks.
This place really isn't for the healthy. :)
Go!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Okay, so the woman who took our order was far from friendly, but that really didn't matter because the food was outstanding!  My son got the Beef Vegetable Stew, and it was amazing.  I got the green chili fry bread which was perfectly flavorful, and delicious.  We can't wait to go there again!  Yeah, not the cleanest, but you can get your food to go, and it wasn't the dirtiest, either, but we made it a point not to look around."}
{"text":"We got the Chocolate and butter fry bread and it tasted great.  We liked it so much we got another one.  We randomly found this place using yelp as we were looking for some kind of desert place.  On arrival, we were not sure if we got the right place, since it looks like a house.  There were some people outside the place that were selling necklaces, etc..

After getting inside, I realized that this was Native American food.  We unfortunately already ate, but we decided to get desert, so we got the chocolate and butter fry bread.  I am glad I found this place, so at least I can say I tried some Native American food, while out in Phoenix.  It also got really busy as we were leaving.  I would like to come back here."}
{"text":"My visit to the FBH was absolutely over the top!  I experienced over the top customer service, the food was over the top good and the portions were over the top huge!  Needless to say there was some serious over indulgence on my part... I'm right there with Dottsy Z.- the Big Red Cream Soda washes the guilt right down!
The manager talked with me for a long time and was helpful with making a decision- it all looked so good I almost couldn't imagine picking only a few things... In the end I believe I made the right call because I was so full when I left the I actually pondered unbuttoning my jeans... fortunately I was out with friends and had to keep my dignity about me.  
I will definitely be putting this place into my regular rotation of favorites..."}
{"text":"The fry bread is always great here. The beans are soooo good! I would recommend trying the tamales too. They're big and flavorful. My little brother loved them."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from their food after talking to the hostess about the poor service we received. They were very rude and,  I'm guessing,  did something to my food.  Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  I havd very high hopes based on other reviews, but The Fry Bread House was just OK.  I tried the green chili soup (very, very good), the ultimate chorizo taco (eh.....) and the chocolate and buter (one bite was enough).  Overall a cute, aka authentic, place with nice enough service, but no need to waste a meal there if you are from out of town."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a two and a half at most. Lots of dirty tables that need to be cleaned.  Very slow service.  No one greeted us when we came in.  My order was wrong, and so over stuffed that I had a hard time eating it.  The red chilie was very good.  My wife and son liked thiers.  Prolly won't return."}
{"text":"The place was ok the harminy stew needed more meat and the fry bread was a little to crispy and hard for me. I'm half Pima and have had much much better plus it cost a lil 2 much I can get a red chilli fry bread for 3.50 on salt river res."}
{"text":"Fry Bread house, what a treat! I went there on a Friday evening and ordered the veggie taco. The fry bread is absolutley delicious and you can get away with spending less than $8 and be completely stuffed.

After the veggie taco, a friend and i shared the honey fry bread desert. Get it, you'll be pissed if you don't. The place isn't much to look at but the food more than makes up for the lack of decoration or ambiance."}
{"text":"The fry bread is good, but it is overpriced and the service is Horrible!  The fact that they gave a Giant Tip jar is hilarious, since they just take your money and call out your name when it's ready.   I guess you're tipping for the indifferent service that is border line rude and obnoxious.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on a cross-country move and ordered the red chili beef fry bread tacos. They were awesome good! The only problem is I'm now craving one and I don't know if I'll ever get there again! It was definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Ultimate Indian Taco is my favorite.  Everything taste homemade and is very fresh.  They have numerous types of Indian Tacos, soups and desserts.  As well, they have a salsa which is mild but flavorful.  I have taken friends and family to this place and they have all loved it.  You can't beat the pricing which is very reasonable for the quality of the food.

Everyone in the place is nice and helpful.  The building is small and pushed back from the street.  I always pass it and have to make a u-turn to get there.  The only negative is the dining area is small and sometimes really packed (but any good place would be packed).  Luckily I have always found a empty booth or table.  Also, what is cool is that  sometimes they do have someone selling Native American Jewelry outside.

I can't speak more highly of the place.  Give it a chance and I am positive you will be back to the place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. Big portions and happy kids. Even had homemade jewelry for sale so the girls loved getting new necklaces and son loves his dream catcher."}
{"text":"We were in town for a short visit and wanted to find fry bread. This was an excellent find. There is a lot of variety on the menu. Tje chocolate and butter dessert fry bread was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Fried dough topped with red or green chile beef: that should be enough to make you want to eat here.  There are other menu items but this is what we came for and what the place is named for and it did not disappoint.  I would have been happy with a bowl of either the red or green chile beef on its own, but served on top of the crispy-tender fry bread and topped with creamy shredded cheese and crisp lettuce - the whole thing was great.  It wasn't easy to pick up and eat like a taco so I used fork and knife.  Definitely worth the drive across town.
Order at the counter and they bring it to your table. About $10 for a fry bread with red or green chile beef.  They also have sweet/dessert fry breads, tamales, etc. but we were pretty full from our chile beef fry breads.  If we're back in Phoenix (were in town from Virginia) we would try to visit again."}
{"text":"This place...this place....just too damn delicious. Vegetarian taco is my specialty while the Chorizo taco is the boyfriends. It is complete heaven: humongous frybread, slathered with beans, meat or vegetables, cheese, and huge sodas. Lunch time it is PACKED, but after hours it is always calm and relaxing. The food is prepared quickly and they never miss a beat.

*Conan and Andy advertised it for their live show* This demonstrates the pure power of the Fry Bread House."}
{"text":"Nothing too great about this place. Food was ok once we sent back the reheated food we first got. Once they made it fresh, it was good. Customer service was nothing great, but also not horrible. It would be nice to be able to get a free refill on the fountain soda too."}
{"text":"So beyond superb! I've been twice, just wish there was an East Valley location!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the Fry Bread House! When I grew up we would go to the AZ State Fair just to pick up some Indian fry bread. When I discovered this restaurant I was a happy guy. I often enjoy a fry bread with green chile beef, AND a bowl of red chile stew. I have found that it is good to add on the stew because two fry breads are too much food for me but one fry bread isn't enough. The green chile is spicy but not bad spicy. Slow burn build up spicy with a lot of flavor. The red chile has a terrific earthy slow burn to it as well. The fry bread is Perfect here! If you are from out of town and you want to experience the Southwest, this is one of the places that you should begin your journey!"}
{"text":"The food is always spot on but the place smells like mildew.   I think they mop the whole place with mops that need to be cleaned.  The food is good so I keep going back but this last time the oder was so bad I couldn't enjoy my food so I ate as quickly as I could and got out of there."}
{"text":"I love this place it is sooo good the green chili taco is to die for.  I would recommend this place anytime of the day.  The soups are soooo yummy as well you have try everything on the menu at least once."}
{"text":"I've traveled the west coast and parts of the east coast finding and trying fry bread and I've gotta tell you, this is the best of the best!

Most fry bread at other places is of an entirely different consistency, but at the Fry Bread House, their bread is PERFECT!
It goes well by itself, with a soup, or even topped with something to make for a delicious dessert!

The few times I've been there, I've also ordered the hominy soup which is very delicious to eat along with the fry bread.

I highly recommend those two together.

As for the dessert (the offer a variety of toppings for the fry bread, I've had the honey and sugar and the chocolate) Both are good, but the honey and sugar is a bit messy, so be prepared for that. The chocolate is also a bit messy. The different toppings add a bit more sweetness to the fry bread, but honestly, I find it best when served warm without any toppings at all.

Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents when they came to visit.  Our first experience with fry bread was down in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument several years ago, and we were looking to try more.

The chili taco was very good -- not what I expected, but who cares when it's good?  We also got cinnamon and sugar fry bread, and honey fry bread.  *nom!*  The only bad thing was it's fried (duh) so the grease factor is extremely high.  I really can't eat a taco AND share a dessert bread without getting sick.  Unless you are used to eating a lot of unhealthy foods, pick either the meal or the dessert (I'd pick the dessert!) or go with a friend and split everything to cut down on your grease factor."}
{"text":"Best fry bread in the world.  I lived in Phoenix and took eveyrone who visited me to the Fry Bread House and after all these years we talk about taking a weekend trip back to AZ just to get our Navajo Taco fix.  My only gripe with them is that they aren't open later, I get that it is a family run establishment however I would usually get my craving around 7pm.  I love this place though."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is so good! If you want good fry bread that tastes almost homemade this is the place to go."}
{"text":"How. How much do I love this place? Lots! The staff was enjoyable. He was wearing ASU garb and we were in our U of A shirts. He has helpful. The food was spectacular. I had the red chili and will gladly have it again. Me two young sons enjoyed their food. They especially enjoyed the chocolate fry bread. Parking is a challenge but totally worth it. Do yourself a favor and stop by when near by."}
{"text":"If your feeling the craving of a homemade fry bread but don't want to put in the work, GO HERE! It was delicious! I got the Indian taco with green chili beef and it was a tad on the spicy side but the flavor was on point."}
{"text":"I would have probably given this 3 stars if not for the awesome green chili stew and the variety of dessert frybreads that rock my world.

The various frybread tacos are solid, but nothing that exceptional. I like the chorizo one with lots of hot sauce. 

It's a good neighborhood spot when you're in the mood for something a little different, or especially if you've got a sweet tooth! :)"}

{"text":"First ever experience with Indian food and definitely NOT a fan.

Exterior definitely looked like a house as their name calls for. A tad bit worn both interior and exterior. Furnitures were simply cafeteria like tables and you order at the counter paying upfront.

Their # 1 rave after hominy stew was a must try so I did so and for sure there will be a no second time. Blindfold me and I would've never been able to tell if this was homemade or out of a Progress/Campbells can. Stew definitely had sufficient ingredient but simply lacks flavor. Abundant amount of hominy in every spoon but does not suit my palate at all. Protein was tough and soup tasted run down. 

Fried bread reminds me of chinese donuts served for breakfast except a tad bit more doughy and is flattened to a circular shape. The bread itself is a great foundation for both entree and dessert if all ingredients were done right. I ordered a taco and a dessert (all utilizes fried bread) and was devasted with the ingredient used. The chocolate butter dessert was simply a cup full of butter poured over a cup of chocolate syrup. NOt to mention that the bread was already deep fried. Enough grease where a pack of oil absorbant sheet can't even save. Flavor was just like how it sounded. 

Taco itself was ground meat, refried bean, lettuce and cheese. Definitely tasted like something you can get at a taco bell/ Del Taco. No special marination nor seasoning done. 

I guess if i'm ever craving fried bread itself and if I\"m by the area..which will never be..I'd probably pick one up and slap something on there myself. However it wasn't all that unique to me since Chinese cuisine carries close to identical \"fried bread' they make.

Plentiful parking. Poor service since I was turned down for needing an extra set of utensils.

{"text":"Best. Food. Ever. The green chile fry bread taco is to die for. Posole is excellent too. Always consistent. Always authentic."}
{"text":"Yes I drove 30-35 minutes to The Fry Bread House because of indian fry bread. We went to Payson recently had it there and really wanted indian fry bread!! Has anyone had it? If not, you need to! Since we made the drive there we decided to try their indian style tacos - the beans, cheese and toppings were surrounding by a lightly fried and fluffed \"shell\" - it was delicious! We did sit down inside, different environment than what we are used to (sticky everything and different crowd of people). You have to give this place a try regardless."}
{"text":"Soon the Frybread House is coming back to 7th Ave (Melrose). Sweet. I like all their stuff. It is the only place I have brought people and they have gone back on their own, that says alot. I got hooked on the \"Frybread House\" when they were on Indian School and 3rd St. LOL! Two little tables for seating, in the center of the table a flower vase with a plastic flower. Ya, the place was small. Most people are walk in/take out. The fry breads that was to big for the paper plates they were served on only add to the charm. Then they found a bigger place on 7th Ave and it was nice, updated, and still had the charm. Moved again and now coming back. Looking forward to having them back in Melrose (7th Ave) and going to oder one of everything!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I've only tried a few items. AND LOVED THEM ALL! Green Chili Stew is delish and has heat to it. The fry bread tacos are amazing also. My 3yo old has been grubbing on their fry bread ever since he was old enough to slobber lol
You gotta go and get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Absolute best place to eat in all of Arizonan the food is magnificent it's delicious every time 
never been disappointed great serviceall-around awesome place and totally affordable something for everyone"}
{"text":"i so miss the mesa location.  i love the red chili and the green chili bowl with the indian fry bread.  i miss the service from the the nice native american indian girl.  please please please come back to mesa.. love you guys."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Feast Day.... 

They're awesome. I wish I could bring all you yelpers to my village's feast day.... it's like... christmas in the early fall except the only presants aren't left under the tree but instead are scooped by 60 year old O'odham grandmothers who have been cooking since childhood and only know unwritten recipes that lack measurement, volumetric or otherwise. 

I could describe to you the food we eat on San Juan's Day (in my village) or Saint Frances Day (Ak-Chin & Salt River)... but if you want a taste of what it's like to line up and part take in the ceremonial meal... head on down to the Fry Bread House.

The BEST way to experience this would be to go and order a bowl red chili stew with side order of frybread and if you're interested a lil baby bowl of beans. and then just wait. Dip and scoop the bread in the stew and enjoy. There's NOTHING better than moistening the light and crispy bread into the broth of the stew. It's heaven!"}
{"text":"Don't just go for the fry bread, the green chili is the best I've ever had. Be sure to try both! (But the fry bread was worth it all by itself)."}
{"text":"The last time i went was on saturday after the fiesta bowl parade, the food was so good the last time that we decided to go after the parade. It was very busy. I was a little disappointed in the portion of red chili i got in my red taco. maybe its a consistancey thing but i remember my taco being loaded last time. My family members and gf liked their food fine. Maybe going again when its not so busy would be better."}
{"text":"You're gonna want to put your eatin' dress on for this place. I have been going to the fry bread house for almost 2 years now and have never had a bad experience. I actually heard about this place from many Phoenicians but wasn't really a fan of fried bread. The food is always phenomenal, the prices are great and you know you're going to leave with a full belly. I went back recently and am not sure if I somehow overlooked it but I noticed that now they have menudo on their menu! Not just served on Saturdays and Sundays like other places. It was excellent! It had a spicy kick to it and was not uber greasy like some places make...actually many places. I find the staff friendly, the environment comfy with all of it's earth tones, and an overall awesome little place to go when you want something hearty. I actually have family that when in town, they come here straight away!"}
{"text":"The original location was wonderful both in food quality and atmosphere. Then the move to the dungeon on East Indian School. Once was enough for me. Dingy, dark, and dirty. Now the new location on 7th Avenue has renewed our interest. Back to an attractive place and the quality of food seemed to improve back to it's old wonderful style. The green chili and posole are great. Glad to have them back after the previous horror shop."}
{"text":"Actually came only for desert. We shared a butter, cinnamom, sugar fry bread and a honey fry bread. We asked for coffee, but (at 2PM) the pot had been time and tasted like it. Should have told us it was old or offered to make a fresh pot. It did have the most robust menu of any Indian Fry Bread Place I've been to. The restaurant is too big, was obviously something else before and is not in good repair, but it is clean. Fast Casual dining (order at counter/delivered to table) Service was fast  Food was fresh and good, other than coffee noted above. I will return."}
{"text":"We used to go to Arizona every year when I was a child and fry bread was always my favorite thing from fairs and rodeos. We recently went back to Scottsdale and found this place online for fry bread. Drove in to Phoenix specifically for it. They tasted exactly like I remembered :) I always get the classic with icing sugar though, I prefer these as a snack or dessert, not first course (Dont get the fruit tea though, tastes like water)"}
{"text":"Don't let the simple decor put you off. Ordered hominy stew and was in heaven. Frybread was fresh and crispy outside while soft and delicious inside. The soup was spiced to perfection and hot. Mom. Enjoyed every single bite."}
{"text":"Today I took a trip to The Fry Bread House for my first taste of the famous bread.  Until just a few days back I had thought fry bread was a desert much like an elephant ear or funnel cake.  I had no idea it was used as the base for a meal (they do offer desert varieties too).

For lunch I had an Indian Taco with green chili beef, beans, cheese and the normal taco fixings only it was served on fry bread as opposed to a tortilla. The taco was tasty and the portion was large.  I paid $5 or $6 and it was well worth it.  Just think about the money that can be spent at any fast food joint and the Indian Taco becomes an even better deal.

Service was easy and fast.  I ordered, picked up my drink, grabbed a paper towel and sat down.  By the time I checked in my name was called and my taco was waiting.  

I was very impressed with The Fry Bread House and I will be returning."}
{"text":"Think about it. A James Beard Award for fry bread. It doesn't have to fancy to be good."}
{"text":"Maybe im crazy but I went here and didnt see the place. 
Was looking forward to it since im from chicago and cant find frybread there.
I also was dissapointed I rushed over since It said they closed at 8pm on a saturday."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! the red chili burro is to die for!!  The green chili stew WOW!!!  If anyone reads this please do yourself a favor and go!!"}
{"text":"Cool place to try once but  not all that. The food is just ok, regular tostada toppings on top of fry bread with some sauce. Don't go in their with 5 star expectations or you'll likely be disappointed.  Positive - They have red cream soda"}
{"text":"Put on your eating shoes for this place...as you will be doing some heavy duty eating. The fry bread is loaded and greasy and dripping and...in a word AMAZING.

The red chilli soaks in to the fry bread which is completely perfect to begin with and sinful when topped with stuff. (like said red chilli) Whatever the step after sinful is, is what the frybread becomes when you drown it in the hotsauce. I am a big sauce guy. this is a big sauce. I would totally eat your granmother if she were drizzled in it.

Parking is a pain but it is well worth it. If you must, just park down the street. You are in the melrose district anyhow. Hit up Copperstar Coffee on the way or shop for your favorite record in Revolver Record store. Its the greatest area in the Valley. 

You will not leave disapointed unless I get there first and eat  up all the frybread.

I am making myself hungry...I wonder if I can make it before 7."}
{"text":"This place is utterly delicious and a great hidden gem of Phoenix. I first had it after they catered an event I went to and I haven't looked back. The chorizo taco and the green chile tacos are my favorites, but the navajo taco is also a top contender, simple but delicious. And you can't go wrong with the wait time. It's quick to get in and get out and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Your Friendly Neighborhood Cholesterol Paradise!

I took a couple friends in town from San Diego here some weeks back for a pre-Chez Nous banquet. Man, you have no idea how much I was looking forward to eating at the Fry Bread House after driving past this joint countless times. Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a politically incorrect, diabetes-inducing culinary wondercarb, but I still had to have some.

First off, it's a very casual place run by members of the Tohono O'odham Nation and the prices are pretty cheap. I looked at the menu and wanted to eat everything, but I decided to be good and *only* got myself the green chili Indian taco. I forget what my friends had, but we then split a fry bread with honey & powdered sugar for dessert.

And can I tell you, it was all so good going down. I sat there all content while listening to Michael Bolton's \"How Can We Be Lovers If We Can't Be Friends?\" oozing out of the soundsystem. 

But then something happened. Something bad. My internal orchestra went into overdrive and I had to make a mad dash for the bathroom. 

SO, the lesson being, for all you digestively normal members of the human population, relax! Come eat here! It's really good! Just don't eat here too often, or your body will hate you. 

And as you for lactose intolerance sufferers, you're well aware that your body already hates you. I don't know what I ate here that caused my gut to go into a tailspin, even after downing 3 Lactaid pills. I'm usually great with eating cheese (pizza? no problem), but I'm assuming the cheese they used in taco was the culprit. Unless they cooked everything in clarified butter instead of lard or oil. Then that would explain things. So if milk has unfortunately become your enemy in recent years, proceed with caution.

But at least for 45 minutes, it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Yeah... I think Frybread house relocated, and is now replaced by \"Two Hippies Magical Mushroom Burger\"...correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, this is about the frybread, not the burger.

Last time I visited this place, I had the frybread, opted with steak instead of shredded beef, with everything on it- cheese, carmelized onions, guacamole, and all the other stuff that makes for a good artery-clogging lunch. And were my arteries clogged indeed! The frybread I ordered was good, especially when I sank my teeth into the stuffed mess, could feel the grease stream down my mouth and chin. My table etiquette was totally abandoned here, but if you could care less about the calories and like grease glossed lips, come here. It's okay."}
{"text":"Decor could use some work but that kinda adds to the charm of this place. The fry bread tacos are unbelievable. My wife had the green and I had the red. Mine was awesome but hers was better. Lol. The house salsa is also sooooo good. Will definitely return every time we come to Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to discover that I didn't have to wait for the state fair or travel north for a great Navajo taco.   Decor is simple and the service is pretty good.  The food is awesome.  My favorite is the vegetarian, with beans and lots of green chili strips.   The tacos are huge and they have really good dessert fry bread.  They also have red cream soda, which you don't find very often.  You can also pick up some Indian jewelery at the stand out front.  Definitely a unique neighborhood treasure."}
{"text":"3.5- This is one of those places that I would be happy going to once every couple of years or so. While I liked the food, it's not something that I see myself craving on a constant basis. The fry bread itself was fresh, chewy and tasted eerily similar to a traditional Chinese breakfast staple called  called \"You Tiao,\" which is a fried bread in the shape of a stick, rather than the round shape of the Native American \"fry bread\" served at The Fry Bread House. 

We tried 2 varieties of the fry bread tacos as well as a sweet fry bread while we stopped here during our roadtrip to the Southwest: chorizo taco, ultimate combo taco and fry bread w/ honey. Again, no complaints about the bread really, but the fillings actually kind of took away from the tastiness of the fry bread. The chorizo was the better of the two \"tacos.\" The meat was spicy and abundant. However, the ultimate combo taco filling was a let-down. There was hardly any beef-- there was way too much refried beans, and it just did not pair well with the fry bread. The sogginess of the filling weighed the bread down. 

The sweet fry bread was very tasty and dripping with honey. However, I was feeling really bloated by the time I got to this portion of the meal-- you see, whatever fry bread I consumed seemed to have expanded at least 3 times in my stomach...

So overall, worth a stop for the curiosity factor. But now I know if I ever wanted to eat Native American \"fry bread\" again, I can just buy some You Tiao from the local Asian grocery and experience pretty much the same taste again."}
{"text":"SO my friend, and I wanted something to eat for dinner..we were craving something other than the usual McDonald's, Denny's, or any other mundane restaurant that failed at tantalizing our taste buds.  So I went on yelp, and looked around for a new, and exciting place for us to explore, and I saw this place.  Now I've had Indian Fry Bread for the first time several months ago, and I loved the store but could never acquire more..so when I saw this place I was all over it.  There isn't an abundance of parking, and it gets crowded very quickly but as my friend stated that's a good sign.  The interior is decorated with Native American artwork, artifacts, and pictures.  It's a pretty cozy place, we will be back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting FBH with my fave Foodie Bear and Robert a while back. (Yeah I'm behind on reviews). All I can say is WOW. I have become a fan of FBH. We walked in to a small, clean space. You order your yummy meal at the counter and you have to be quick to grab a table! My advice, grab a table then go order. For my yummy meal I had the fry bread with beans and green chile. I was delighted to see that I could wash my guilt-ridden meal down with Big Red Cream soda...mmm.. When I bit into my fry bread it was crispy and light on the outside and nice and chewy in the middle. It was so good. I wished for a little more spice or flavor from the green chile sauce, but it still did the job. We also tried the chocolate and butter fry bread. It was so-so in my opinion, but I'm not much of a sweets person so definitely not a knock on FBH! 

I will certainly visit FBH again maybe after I do a giant work out or have been fasting for 5 days... it's just too good to eat on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Came here with a co-worker, trying something new for lunch. Food was delish, but we weren't excited about the price. I spent over $10 on the ultimate frybread (green chili beef, beans, sour cream, and lettuce) and a drink. His total was over $6 for a bean and cheese frybread (and he was still hungry when we left). Maybe we're just cheap, but ouch!
Small space, jam packed, and obviously a popular spot (with a super small parking lot)!Someone that looks like your Grandma making the frybread in the back, which was light and perfectly cooked. Staff was friendly and on top of things and our orders came out quickly. 
Free refills on the iced tea (tropical), but charge for refills on the soda. 
We'd probably come in more often if it were cheaper."}
{"text":"Best favorite so far is their green chili stew, but overall great chow! If your in the mood for authentic Native American food (none of that fair stuff made by non-natives) I'd recommend this as the place to go."}
{"text":"The fry bread is good..a little stingy on the beans (bean and cheese). The red hot sauce is not great.  I really liked the green salsa though.. it's got a uniqe flavor."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Arizona and as we were visiting the Heard Museum he told me  what Fry Bread is and how he hasn't had any in years, but that it's delicious. So I went on Yelp and found this place.
This is your \"made with love\" kind of place. Feels like there's a grandma in the back making the food. It's just SO good.
I had the fry bread with beef stew, and my boyfriend had the Ultimate Taco. Delicious. We ended up coming back the next day where he had the same thing and I tried the Hominy stew. It was my first time trying Hominy and I honestly wasn't a fan of it but the broth was still really good. I just liked the beef stew better. But the frybread! So good. If I had to describe the taste I'd best put it as a Zeppole and Naan bread had a baby. 
The pricing is also great, about $8 for the stew and bread together which is very filling. About $3 for the bread alone. I later on stopped by a fair and saw them selling fry bread far more expensive, so get it here instead!"}
{"text":"Delicious Indian fry bread. The Indian taco is perfect, great beans. A delicious affordable place."}
{"text":"The staff is nice and funny, (5 stars). Food is over priced and ok, 3 stars. the environment is not what you would expect for the amount of money you are paying for the food."}
{"text":"Wow! Best Mexican ever...and that's what i eat out. Fry bread is one of a kind. Go next door for great service and nice people."}
{"text":"Wow. If you're looking for authentic Indian fry bread, this is it! We all enjoyed it. I had the Indian taco and my sisters had the ground beef taco and my other sister also ordered a side of the red chili. They are so big that they are hard to pick up. Next time I think we order fry bread and a side of the chili and of beans so we can tear off pieces and just dip in the good stuff! We shared a butter, cinnamon sugar one for dessert..amazing! Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The first thing you must understand about this restaurant is that it is a dive, and that is being kind.  The interior of The Fry Bread House is TERRIBLE.  If you are looking for anything like a \"fine dining\" experience, look elsewhere.  The place is falling apart, is dirty, unattractive, etc.  Having said that, I went for dinner before catching a show at the nearby Rhythm Room concert venue.  I ordered the green chile stew with fry bread, and they both were excellent.  I would go back, and do recommend, if your sole criteria is the food.  I did read Yelp reviews before trying this place, and can understand why it has received a number of negative reviews.  The staff was friendly, but not effusive.  My food came out about 5 minutes after I ordered it (I was surprised how quickly).  There were a number of families dining there who clearly didn't mind the physical appearance of the restaurant; my impression was that they were regulars.  It's also really inexpensive.  If the restaurant was clean / up to most restaurant standards, it would easily rate 4 stars."}
{"text":"What an amazing place to stumble on as we were just leaving Phoenix! Green chime stew & ultimate taco were unforgettable! If I make it back to Phoenix, I'll make it back to the Fry Bread House!"}
{"text":"I always have a Soup Nazi moment here. Once I ordered a 'Navajo Taco' and not an 'Indian Taco' -- a mistake I will not make again. They are hardcore, but pretty much some of the best food you'll find in Arizona. Every time I sit down to my Indian Taco, I think...this should be the official food of Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It was one of the first places I took my boyfriend to when we first started dating.  The food is fresh, authentic and the fry bread always comes out with the perfect amount of crispiness that I like.  The location isn't the best but I don't mind driving out there because the food is worth it.  The red chili is my favorite. Yum...I need to go back there again soon!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I came here to check out the fry bread. It's a bit different than we have in the Pac NW, thinner, more like an elephant ear. I am used to thicker, doughier fry bread. However, as this was my first fry bread in three years since visiting home, I'll take it, and try not to cry over being homesick. To go with the fry bread I got a bowl of the green chili, and it had amazing flavor. Just fantastic. Spicy enough to make even me happy. 

The price is right, and it's like a little touch of home for me when I was far away from home. I'll take it, and be happy."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Had an all around great experience. From the great customer service, good timing of the food being cooked, to the great taste,etc., all was just sublime. I would recommend this place to the WORLD. Lol... 5 stars! Way to go! :D"}
{"text":"Dam this place has the best fry bread they make the bread better than me! But they need to add more toppings on the Indian tacos since the prices are high."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall is tucked away off of 7th Ave; you have to keep an eye out to spot it.  Upon first glance, the shack-like eatery might not seem like the most appealing place to grab a bite, but sometimes it's the little crappy looking places that have the most authentic and best-tasting food.  Fry Bread House is one of those places for sure.

Fry bread is just that, fried bread.  It can be eaten in a number of ways, including as a taco shell wrap, and here, they are said to be the best in the state.  The fry bread is thick but airy and is folded in half to create their specialty dishes, fry bread tacos.  We tried the green fry bread taco, stuffed with spicy green chili beef, topped with lettuce and cheese, which was delicious.  My personal favorite was the chorizo taco, filled with spicy chorizo, also topped with cheese and lettuce.

Do not leave without having dessert.  The chocolate and butter fry bread is an award winning favorite, using their secret recipe.  It's basically a slab of fry bread loaded with chocolate sauce, butter, and God only knows how many calories.  We tried it and needless to say, it was amazing.

By the time we left, the line was out the door.  This is one of those places you come to indulge and try out the local cuisine.  We made it a pit stop on our trip through Phoenix, but I highly advise against making this greasy spoon a regular lunch spot.  

What it lacked in nutrition, it definitely made up for in taste.  Plus it was super cheap, and great for a quick meal.  I left completely stuffed, but I just had to try it all!  If you're ever in Phoenix, I have to insist that you stop in for a fry bread taco and/or a sweet!"}
{"text":"Great food good prices.  Little hole in the wall joint definitely worth experiencing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been there twice now and had the red chile taco. Holy crap that's good!
My sole problem with the place is the lack of free drink refills. Especially with the spicy food, come on guys, you gotta get on the bandwagon!"}
{"text":"Fry bread was excellent, the facility is another story.
Men's bathroom should be condemned, one urinal working, the men,s stall door held together by duct tape, a sign on the door said toilet out of order.
The booths in the restaurant have ripped seats, two booths have handwritten signs saying do not sit here, table appears to be cracked.
Been coming here every winter while in Arizona, tonight will be the last visit.
If this was inspected, surely would be told to clean up or shut down

Two stars for food!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to get Indian fry bread when the state fair wasn't around. This is my first time going to the new location and it's kind of scary. Inside, it looks like an old Mexican restaurant and they have cloth hanging everywhere to hide windows and openings. The staff doesn't try to make conversation at all. As far as the food goes, the fry bread itself was great but the beans were cold. I don't know if I'll return. I'm kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here, the food comes out great. The fry bread is always fresh (a good mix of crunchy and fluffy), and the green chili stew will leave you sniffling (in a good way, of course). This new location is quite a bit of a downsize, however, and it also looks like they got rid of selling native jewelry on the side. This new location comes with two personal restrooms for the diners, but some might find the parking a bit of a squeeze during their rush hours. Regardless, anywhere that the Fry Bread House goes, I'll be going. Always a fan."}
{"text":"OMG!!  This place was amazing!!  My first time here. The place is nice and clean.  I had the ultimate green taco and it was delicious!!  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place was very popular, and there was a line at the door.  The food is very simple cooking, but its door well.  The menu has a lot of variations on he same thing, and items are just different fillings for the fry bread.  You order at the counter and they call you for picking it up.  Dining is simple and spartan.  there is eating area outside too.  Everything our party ordered was good, but I would not give it an off the hook rating.  All in all with the price being cheap, it was a place that I would recommend and visit again.  Excellent for take out due to the limited seating."}
{"text":"I came here during a long lunch break coming from the Convention Center on light rail. So glad I made the trek! Never had fry bread before and it reminded me of bhattura in India Indian cuisine. So tasty! Their menu has a lot options but I went with a regular fry bread option. Would try a stew next time!"}
{"text":"Absolute BEST Frybread place in Phoenix. The only frybread I prefer over this place would be the home-made frybread my friends Rocky and Mario would make, so you know I'm not messing around with this, folks. Try their amazing Frybread Tacos, which was vegetarian friendly, btw and if you do eat meat, their green chili is an absolute delight. Cheap, quick, and open late--- If I could give this place 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Tasty food, casual atmosphere.  Add this to your list of favorite local mom and pop ethnic restaurants to take out of town guests, it's one of those unique places that my return visitors tell others about and ask to be taken back to.  If you're lucky you may see former Governor Rose Mofford (beehive hairdo and all) enjoying a frybread in one of the booths.  i'm partial to the frybreads that come with green chili, either on board or on the side.  the powdered sugar and honey one's also very tasty but i usually don't have room for that after a meal...but hey, you could stroll up  7th Ave to checkout some of the cool antique and vintage fashion and art shops in the Melrose neighborhood, then stroll back to FBH for that powdered sugar and honey frybread.  in the past they have sometimes had a live chicken scratch band playing in their parking lot on First Friday night which only adds to the local color.  i need to go by and see if that's still the case -hope so!"}
{"text":"Just plain good. 

My husband and I went with our three youngest kids. They loved it, we loved, we all left full and happy. 

My husband and I had the Fry Bread Tacos. The fry bread was perfect. I had the green chili with all the fixins' and my husband had a red chili and cheese taco. He hadn't been all that excited about going here for dinner, but he changed his mind pretty fast! 

Both the red and green chili were delicious. I preferred the green. 

One son had a bean and cheese burro which was perfect from the tortilla to the beans that were cooked perfectly. 

Another son had the folded cheese crisp and I don't know what they did to it to make it so yummy but I think it might have had a little magic in it. 

For dessert we shared a chocolate butter fry bread and it was to die for but VERY rich. To share it between the five us we had more than enough.

The man at the counter was helpful and funny (in a sassy sort of way) and we didn't hold it against him that he was wearing and ASU shirt ;) GO CATS!

If you are over on this side of town - this is a must stop. Go, go, go!"}
{"text":"Try the chocolate and butter fry bread. The dessert was sweet and salty but very fatty so if you want a healthy dessert go for fro yo because you will feel guilty after this one. It kind of reminded me of a crispier funnel cake. Next time I want to try a fry bread taco which looks like a huge chalupa."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I would definitely go back. I had the pozole and it was really good. I also had a green chili fry bread taco. That was delicious. The only thing I would suggest is not to order the red menudo. I had it and I didnt know what to... The red sauce was made from enchilada sauce.  I did not enjoy it, but the rest of it was terrific. I dont have to wait for the state fair to have fry bread. YEAY!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place whenever I'm in the mood for fry bread. Since I'm vegetarian I order their Indian Taco most of the time. Their dessert fry breads are really good too. The restaurant is a bit pricey in my opinion and it sucks that they moved from 7th Ave to 10th street. The workers aren't all that friendly sometimes but I truly enjoy the food here. Overall I feel this place is worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"I read about this place in a guide book before I traveled to Phoenix. The description was interesting enough to make me want to try it, and sure enough, I made my way to The Fry Bread House not really sure what to expect from my first fry bread taco. 

Plenty of parking in the lot, not a big parking lot by any means, but I was able to grab a spot. Although I can imagine the parking headaches that one must endure during busier hours. 

We arrived at about 5:30PM on a Tuesday night and there were plenty of other people and families enjoying their dinner in this tiny place. This is a seat-yourself type of restaurant, so don't expect much from the service. Plenty of booths and a few stand alone tables. The ordering process here is easy: you simply walk up to the counter, tell the cashier what you want, leave your name, find yourself a seat, and they call out your name when the food is ready. 

Everything on the menu was intriguing, with a wide variety of fry bread tacos and a dessert menu that really looked quite appetizing. Unfortunately for us, we were so full from the enormous portions, there was no room for it. We would have loved to try the chocolate and butter or golden honey fry bread. Next time! 

For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese crisps, which is basically a large baked tortilla with melted cheese on it. This dish was just okay. Not really what I was expecting, but still delicious and cheesy. Add a little bit of hot sauce for a tasty kick. For dinner, we stuck with the fry bread tacos. I ordered an indian taco and my girlfriend ordered the vegetarian taco. Both of them were awesome! The indian taco consists of refried beans, cheese and lettuce wrapped in deliciously fluffy fry bread. The vegetarian taco is basically the same thing except it also comes with onions, sour cream, and green chilies. Since this was our first trip here, we were not prepared for the massive size of these tacos. They actually look like small babies wrapped in diapers. 

Overall, a great place if you are a traveler looking for something different that you won't find at home, and an awesome place for the locals to enjoy great Native American cuisine. I hope they don't take it for granted!"}
{"text":"Bummer. I really want to like this place. The food is awesome....sort of....9 times out 10 the food I have gotten is cold. It's a big sloppy mess too. How hard is it to neatly scoop some beans on a giant fry bread? The staff is rude. Condescending signs posted everywhere- as though they are talking to all their customers like children-\"don't touch the cups.\" \"Don't swing on the or even touch ropes\". No refills on sodas? Ice tea tastes like it's been sitting in the pot for a few days. Rancid. But that is free refills. Come on, their profit margins can't be that low? Seriously? Or how about $1.00 for a sprinkle of lettuce or a $1.50 for a sprinkle of tomatoes. I could buy a pound of tomatoes and a head of lettuce for that price. Seriously? 50¢ is plenty for those extra toppings. But don't bother, because if you get it to-go, you'll have to microwave it to avoid food poisoning. I called them to see if they will do anything about the cold food. They wanted me to bring the food back so they can \"look it over\". Not offering a solution we didn't bother and threw it in the trash. $26 down the drain. We won't be going back.  Maricopa County Health Department needs to do a surprise inspection here. I'm certain the food is NOT being kept at proper temperatures. Gross."}
{"text":"Food was okay...had the taco. Not reservation standards...too commercial. The fry bread was good; however, the service is awful. I guess that is where you encounter the reservation! Huge reservation attitude! Very pricey! I ordered a taco and bread from facebook marketplace and found that it was better with better pricing! Frybread House I paid over twenty dollars on a taco, four frybreads with one that had powdered sugar. (according to their pricing, it is $3.45 for powdered sugar. They need to find cheaper powdered sugar.) Facebook Marketplace...same purchase...$12; and it was better tasting and faster. I don't know...we need to get some other natives together and give them some competition..."}
{"text":"Wanna absolutely over the top fry bread indulgence?  Try the Chocolate and Melted Butter Frybread - AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best frybread I have ever had! The portions are huge! I split the Ultimate taco with red chili with my son. My daughter tried one with green chili and liked it even though it was too spicy for her. We also shared a chocolate frybread. The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant clean. Much nicer than their old location."}
{"text":"Being that I'm Native American and its pretty popular with ppl I hang with I was kinda disappointed. Frybread was a little too crispy and maybe I'm just used to my family's style of chili but it didn't satisfy me. I also had the menudo and I'm very particular about menudo so I didn't enjoy that either. Overall my experience wasn't satisfying but other ppl should give it a try and decide for yourself if you like it. I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"very simple and friendly place, the indian bread was different and good. staff was very friendly and recommended some good choices, nice gift store inside."}
{"text":"I love me some Navajo Tacos.  So so so so good.  Do yourself a favor and use the salsa in the squeeze bottles.  I wish they would sell it!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, cheap and a dream come true outside the fairgrounds. Have a ball"}
{"text":"While Fry Bread House East gets 5 stars I can only give the Phoenix location 4 stars. Still good fry bread but not as good as their other location. We've eaten at the old location on 7th  several times and a couple of times on Indian School. The difference seems to be in the fry bread itself, the Baseline location fluffier and perfectly cooked while the Indian School location was a bit thinner and a little greasy. Both locations share the same excellent red and green chile and beans."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I've always enjoyed fry bread but have always worried about the amount of oil that goes in.  Fry Bread House has somehow reduced the amount of oil in their fry breads.  I always get one of the chilis and a fry bread.  The chili here is really excellent, full of meat and flavor.  I tend to prefer the green to chili to the red chili, but they're both fantastic.  If they have the tamales, definitely check those out as well.

Seriously, if you're in Phoenix, you absolutely have to check out Fry Bread House."}
{"text":"The best fry bread in town.  While I havent had tons of fry bread I have had my fair share and The Fry Bread House was the winner by leaps and bounds.  They make the bread fresh everyday and top it with very delicious green and red chili and beans.  The dessert fry bread comes with butter and melted chocolate that drips off your bread.  I recommend sharing with someone if you have anything to do for the rest of the day.  Also the parking can be tight at peak hours as the spots are limited."}
{"text":"Best and largest fry read taco I've ever had!!!  The menudo didn't have enough meat but I honestly can't complain it was still delicious. I've been ordering the burritos lately because the are delicious and I've never had a tortilla like it. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This is the worst service I ever had!!! Was not pleased with the cashiers smart remarks, I lost my appetite when bathroom door opened! I can't believe I was \"QUESTIONED\" for requesting extra silverware for my toddler! I was completely disappointed with the food taste and quality!!! They are unfriendly to kids and my family and I will definitely not ever return!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone down hill since they've moved to this location. Don't know if it's under different management, but the food is extremely salty and the service is REALLY poor. I will not go back to this place nor will I recommend the place."}
{"text":"I am the type of traveler who loves to eat food specific to the area instead of running to a chain restaurant I can get back home.  The last time I was in AZ which was about 12 years ago, I tried the fry bread Indian tacos and even bought the mix to make at home.  It has been a long time and will have to see if I have pics, but for some reason I don't remember it being this huge, not that I am complaining.   

I knew I had to stop by again and introduce my dad to something different.  The fry bread is thick but soft and have a slightly airy quality to it.  For us non-spicy lovers, we got the hamburger filling (ground beef, cheese, and lettuce).  Funny thing is my husband ordered the ground beef combo which we thought came with sauce but the only difference was the addition of refried beans.  Regardless, it was a tasty and filling meal right after our flight in."}
{"text":"Great Native American food! I always get the Vegeterian Indian Taco when I come here and it never dissapoints. Great taste! Just make sure you add salt to it cause they don't seem to put much or any in it. Biggest fry bread house I've been to. This place is huge compared to all the others around. Great spot."}
{"text":"Was just in Phoenix for Cactus League baseball and before I left I checked out local cheap eats in the area.  The Fry Bread House was something that caught my attention.  I'm so glad we came here.  We had the shreaded hatch red chile beef combo taco, it was AWESOME!  We also shared an order of the green chile stew, again great and we shared the cinnamon sugar fry bread for dessert.  All was great, the three of us were stuffed and all for $30.  If you like spicy, if you like new mexican and american indian food you will love this place.  Try it out if you are ever in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I love this place, the fry bread is awesome.  I have one complaint however, this is the second time we have been overcharged for our food.  I mean really, how can 3, $7.99 items with no drinks, cost $32.95??? . My husband, who ordered the food, didn't realize until after they had ran his debit card, that this was the total....too late to rectify it now!!!
Anywho, next time we go there, it's gonna be CASH ONLY!!  They can't screw that up...I hope!"}
{"text":"I went looking for a puffy taco like I'd find in San Antonio, TX. Close but not the same. Indian fry bread was a little breadier than I hoped for but still pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Ok..so my gf  RAVED about this place, and we went for lunch.  I was excited! I had a big fry bread taco. The bread was thick, and good, but the stuff inside the taco lacked any real flavor or distinctive taste.  Bland --and nothing interesting.  

It basically was fried bread with lettuce, meat, beans and some shredded cheese slapped in it.  Very filling, and I got fed.  I really wanted it to taste good because my gf was all into it. 
 By the time we were done,  I really wondered if she needed taste bud implants.  I would try other things next time, but I know flavor --and The Fry bread house just didn't have it."}
{"text":"Is there anything better than eating a Green Chili Beef Frybread at the Fry Bread House while Journey's Separate Ways blasts in the background? I think not."}
{"text":"100% predictably good food that is bad for you; the taste is worth the splurge of calories and fat. Delicious consistently."}
{"text":"If you want to have an extraordinary taco Tuesday, or an awesome taco anyday than this is definitely the place to get it! Be prepared to get great customer service, incredible flavor, completely full, and to eat your taco with both hands or to attack it using your knife and fork! If you're looking for fancy, this isn't the place. The menu is on the wall, you order at the register, you take your number, grab your own drink and seat yourself. Located in the old Panchos building they're not about gorgeous decor it's all about great food. I came in with the International Supper Club, other wise I probably would have never discovered this diamond in the rough. I ordered the green chili taco, the fry bread was soft, the inside filled with spicy goodness that melted in your mouth. I wanted to order the dessert bread but 1 taco filled me up! I'll be back, I've already looked it up to see if I could race over on my lunch hour from Tempe. They're moving soon to the 7th ave  & Camelback area but either way it's definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"YES. Yes the location isn't much to look at. Yes the building is larger than the old place, and yes, the tables could be kept clear of debris. But food? YES!  Taste? YES! YES! YES!  (I would have included a photo of my green chile taco but it was gobbled up before I could get my phone out!). Spicy, flavorful, intense -- if you are in Phoenix & looking for some local taste YOU MUST TRY THE FRY BREAD HOUSE! Oh yes, and the prices are easy to swallow, too!"}
{"text":"Always love going to this restaurant. The service has always been nice and the food is on point. Everything from the chili, stew, soup, tamales, fry bread, and specials. At the moment my family favorite is kokoji. Looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"I have memories that make my mouth water.  My mother calls me everytime she passes through Phoenix to ask me where this place is.  She tells her friends in Los Angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to Phoenix.  They all rave after their experience.  

The fry bread house is as authentic as it gets.  Indian tacos, fry bread with sugar, and oh my god--the red chili stew.  I think I just drooled a little on my keyboard.  

The place does get a little cramped during meal times, but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down Central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we weren't wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures.  

Make sure they are open before you make the trek, they have funky hours."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Can't go wrong with this place!!! My daughter and hubby love this place! The Fry bread is so good I can eat it plain!! Everyone that works there is super chill including the atmosphere!!! It's worth the drive!! It's YUMMO!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been going to the fry bread house out in Mesa and it was recently closed. Me my fiance and my brother in law came over here because we've been dying for fry bread. But the quality in the flavor was definitely not there.  the mesa establishment had. Flavor chunks of meat and quality tasting chille. I felt like I ordered a red chili soup in my fry bread very runny hardly any meat and the red chili sauce honestly tasted like store bought red chili tamales. The bread itself was very good but the red chillies suck. I mean it tasted like can sauce. I mean is money that tight you can't make homemade chili sauce? Cuz Homemade should never taste like store bought. Either way I don't see myself ever coming back. 38$ for store bought red chille. Smh"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SOOO FREAKIN' GOOD! 

I have visited the fry bread house a couple of times on our way through phoenix eastbound from cali.  As an LA native, fry bread tacos were unlike anything I ever had but also familiar, with delicious fillings that reminded me of the mexican food I grew up with, like chorizo and chile verde and awesome refried pinto beans.  but the chewy, crispy fry bread brought everything to a whole new level.  I'm kinda glad that we don't live nearby because, while delicious, I'm sure its totally artery-clogging. 

Also not touristy at all, looks like a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of folks come here for the fry bread tacos - well......I had to be different and have their red chili beef tamale.  The BEST tamale I have had in a LONNNNNNNG time.  I also got the fry bread with honey because in another life I swear I was a bear - I can't turn down honey ever.  My hubby had their pozole soup.......very flavorful and the meat in it was ridiculous!  This will be a visit of MANY more to come.  I LOVE the Fry Bread House."}
{"text":"The fry bread was flat out amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect the first I ate here and I was pleasantly surprised with my choice. I got the beef taco with red sauce.. literally to die for. Unfortunately it's more unhealthy than I would like but sometimes the best tasting food is bad for you."}
{"text":"The fry bread was good. Texture was soft and chewy. It wasn't as crispy as I was told but it's probably because they wrapped it in paper foil since the cheese bread was super crunchy. 

My friend and I both got the ground beef not realizing there was shredded beef. I would have liked too try that too. We were hungry after a 6 hour car ride and didn't read the menu in depth. Anyhow, the beef was average in quality. Taste was also average. However when you put the green sauce on, it was a lot better.

My friends and I had fry bread in Alaska too and it seems that this place didn't take time to drip out the oil as much (or pat it out) so we had a lot of oil on the deli paper which they wrapped the fry bread taco in. That wasn't a plus for one of my more health conscious friends. But I just pat the oil out of mine with the napkins they gave us. 

For me, there was so much meat in the Indian ground beef taco, I was actually able to split it into two tacos since I had bought extra fry bread just to munch on."}
{"text":"The place is a dump . But it has good food . We tried their chorizo  fry bread this had red sauce and had a nice spicy kick. We always love their green chili fried bread the portions seem a little  bigger than normal . At the counter they pushed for a tip . . Parking lot is Huge"}
{"text":"My friend hyped this place up so I finally came. I ordered the pasole and it came out cold. I'm not sure if that is how they sell it or maybe they just didn't warm it up. Obviously it's not fresh! I will probably try it one more time to see if they have a better option on their menu. I really want to like it because I loved them at their previous location"}
{"text":"They moved recently.  The place is newer and cleaner . Much better decorated. Prices are higher . Portions are smaller. Not a good  combination.  The bread seems to be thinner.the red.  Chiliwas very bland. I liked my beans and chili. It  would have been a little spicier"}
{"text":"I've come here on two occasions and enjoyed my orders both times. The hominy stew and the vegetable beef stew are very tasty, and the fry bread is a perfect complement. Fast service, good prices. I'll definitely be back to try the tacos."}
{"text":"I'd never had fry bread before, so I was thrilled to try it here. My vegetarian bean and cheese burrito was not just massive but also very tasty (and messy). A vegetarian or vegan can get a huge and delicious meal here for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service!! I just wish they were located in Vegas!! Next time I come to Phoenix, I will definitely stop!!"}
{"text":"First time is the best time! Cant wait to go back and try the Fry Bread and Butter!"}
{"text":"I love the FBH. I have been eatting her since i was little. Green/red chili and menudo were all fantastic this time and everytime."}
{"text":"On the journey from Boca Raton, FL to San Jose, CA, I thought I'd be able to find some fry bread along the highway at some random stand or truck stop, but no luck.  I have only had fry bread once before, on a meandering cross-country alcohol and testosterone infused college spring break with some buddies.  One of them knew about fry bread and not only did we have some, but we got a recipe for it!  (long since lost, and never tried, but such is the folly of youth)

Haven't had any since college, so thought I'd get it while the gettings good (i.e. while crossing through states like NM and AZ which I never do).  I am no connoisseur of the bread, though it's good and greasy.  Cripsy too, which was my favourite part.  I had the bread as part of the House special, choosing the green chile stew.  I have been out of Texas and the southwest, so I was pleasantly surprised that the thing was actually spicy!  A perfect complement to the fry bread.

It was very good. I'm not saying it's a must-do in Phoenix, but it does fit along the lines of SW comfort food, while at the same time likely different from most food to which you are accustomed.  On a cold day (night) it would be a perfect dish."}
{"text":"Very good fry bread, but a bit pricey.  It had been a few years since I last visited this place at the old location.  $2.99 for plain is reasonable, but $5.99 seems pricey for fry bread with honey especially when there wasn't a lot of honey. Also, fry bread with honey and sugar for $7.49 seems pricey. Probably would go back and just get the plain and bring my own honey and sugar."}
{"text":"I want to say up front that this rating is solely for the interior and exterior of the restaurant. I had lunch here today and the food was good and the staff were very nice. My problem with this place was the décor, (or lack thereof) along with the \"old\" and dirty smell/feel of the dining room. Furniture that needed to be replaced long ago with ripped seats that are cheaply taped over, broken tables with hand written notes on them telling the customer \"DO NOT SIT HERE!\", very poor lighting, and just an overall \"dirty\" feel.  I thought I was eating in some third world bomb shelter or something. Outside wasn't any better with overgrown weeds, dirty windows, etc. Now thinking about my experience today, I wonder how clean the kitchen is? Won't be back."}
{"text":"I thought it was quite good. Los Angeles has almost every type of food, but fry bread is hard to find. The bread did not look or taste overly greasy. I got the green chili bowl and my dad got the red chili bowl. Both were flavorful and pretty spicy. The beef in both chilis was very lean and tender. The red chili had more meat but maybe it's because that's basically the only visible ingredient. The green chili had other ingredients such as strips of green chili and onions, etc. The bowls looked small but by the time we finished them, along with 1.5 pieces of fry bread each, we were stuffed."}
{"text":"Well worth the two hours you will need to spend at the gym working it all off."}
{"text":"I am going to have to take the unpopular side on this. 

i was not impressed. I had the fry bread with the green chile. It had lettuce and cheese on it, too. 

so dull and bland. the fried bread was too much and the green chile was totally lacking flavor.  I felt like it needed salt or something.

I had a taste of the dessert fry bread w powdered sugar and honey and well...i don't get it. it tastes like regular old carnival fry bread to me. it's yummy but not worth driving here for. 

I was really hoping the fry bread taco things would be super yummy but not so much :("}
{"text":"In 2012, The Fry Bread House garnered a rare honor.  A coveted James Beard Award.  Founded by Cecilia Miller in 1992, this Tohono O'odham Nation inspired restaurant was given an American Classics Award by the Beard Foundation.  If my memory serves me correctly, I believe that was two locations ago.  I can't say for certain, largely because The Fry Bread House has moved around a lot over the last couple of years.  First they were in the Melrose District, then they moved east to the Coronado District.  Now they're back in Melrose and have stood still long enough for me to finally come by and get a meal.  On a Thursday around dinner, it was fry bread time.

You'll find The Fry Bread House's current (and hopefully permanent) location on the southeast corner of 7th Avenue and Hazelwood (midway between Camelback and Indian School).  Inside, the restaurant can pretty snuggly sit around 50-60 patrons max.  Unsurprisingly you'll see plenty of Native American art, photos, and other symbols adorning the walls of this valley staple.  You order at the register here (and negotiate a somewhat odd triangular metal frame used to form the customer line) and they bring the food and drink out to you.

I've had my fair share of fry bread in my time.  But for me fry bread was always more of a fair food.  I'd had various iterations at the Arizona State Fair growing up and even at county fairs around the state.  In fact I've only had fry bread once in a restaurant setting prior to this (a dessert fry bread at a Mexican restaurant in Flagstaff in case you're curious).  Here at Fry Bread House it's available both as a dessert and as the main entree itself.  The menu here decidedly tilts along the lines of traditional Sonoran Mexican food, but with Native American influences.  So for those dining here for the first time, much of the menu options will look familiar to longtime valley connoisseurs of Mexican food.

For my first go around, I ordered as follows:  A fountain drink, a Ground Beef Combination Fry Bread Taco, and a Chocolate & Butter Sweet Fry Bread.  Total cost for all of this including tax came to $20.  Let's first discuss the Combo.  Ground beef, refried pinto beans, lettuce and shredded cheese.  Sounds familiar right?  Now put all that on a piece of warm pillowy soft fry bread that's twice the size of your average dinner plate.  Think I'm exaggerating?  Look at my photo.  Or better yet make the same mistake that I did and try to eat this taco with your hands.  You will fail as hilariously as I did.  This thing is genuinely huge but the fry bread largely works well here as a vehicle for all those dairy and veggie toppings.  While the fry bread is solid, honestly the taco otherwise tasted like...well...a taco.  Just in gargantuan form.  As for the Chocolate & Butter Sweet Fry Bread?  Same size fry bread as my taco, but this one is carved up in pizza form and covered in warm milk chocolate and lots of warm butter.  They brag that this has been an award winner for them.  If you've ever had a sweet sopaipilla before, this will probably remind you of it's sweetness and crispiness (albeit slightly more oily).  I liked this dessert for the most part.  It's not especially hearty, but rather a light and airy dessert that can easily be devoured by yourself despite the enormous size of the bread.

All things considered I would say my first meal here was okay.  The taco and dessert were decent and in each case the bread stood out as the most noticeable and well made component.  Though I will say the rest of the presentation in each case was somewhat bland to me.  I trust that Cecilia and her staff are largely sticking to their traditional roots with their menu, and good for them for doing so.  I suppose all those years of fry bread at fairs and the variety of Mexican food at my disposal have me yearning for something a little more bold than what Fry Bread House's menu offers.  Nevertheless I embrace fry bread's place in our culinary history and applaud Fry Bread House and other fry bread proprietors for keeping the tradition alive.  Whether bolder iterations of this bread will evolve beyond the fair circuit?  Your guess is as good as mine."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Haven't been in a while but will check it out again at the end of December."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I'm embarrassed to admit that I've only recently visited here for the first time. Especially being a Phoenix native living close to Guadalupe who grew up on Fry Bread with honey and powdered sugar. Of course my expectations were high for my first visit to Fry Bread House - James Beard recognized and the Green Chili Beef Taco voted as a top dish from AZCentral's Dominic Armato. Plus all its history here in the Valley going back to when it opened in 1992. The restaurant is located within the Melrose district (after a couple relocations). The decor pays homage to Native American culture with plenty of pictures and a Man in the Maze motif standing in place of a welcome mat. The roped off line to the ordering area at first confused me but I eventually caught on. There was a good mixed crowd here and plenty of regulars. Even though I already had my mind set on the taco, the Chumuth Burro, the Red Chili stew and the Hominy stew with plain fry bread called out to me from the menu on the wall as I waited. Service was quick and easy and they really try to move the line. The green chili taco was a lot bigger than I thought. I'm not going to lie, it was also a bit sloppy to eat. But when you stuff a fry bread with all that yummy gooey goodness it's probably not going to hold together for long. The fry bread is light and crisp and folded into a taco shape. The chili beef was nice and tender with cheese and the perfect amount of spiciness for me. It was a pretty good meal for $9 and good first experience for me. I'm dying to try that stew next time around. I'm also looking forward to introducing some of my Native buddies to this place."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for the SERVICE! My mom and I rushed to get this place by 7pm, since the restaurant closes exactly at that time. We arrived at 7pm, and the door was locked. We knocked until the person at the cash registered allowed us to come in. 

Surprisingly, all of the credit card transactions and the cash register closes exactly at 7pm. Must be a systems thing. The store worker said that the dinner would be on the house. NO WAY!! He was so generous letting us order past the closing time. We definitely paid $15 in cash for our order.

The food was pretty tasty!! I wish we could have eaten the fry bread fresh, but we had to rush to the airport. 

We ordered:
+ Green chili taco- with lettuce, chunks of beef, and cheese. Pretty good meaty flavor, and a bit messy to eat. I probably used 10 napkins.

+ Vegetarian taco- with refried pinto beans, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. I couldn't taste the beans as the sour cream masked the flavor.

+ Honey bread dessert- Basically a flat fry bread and you pour the honey. Simple concept, but the bread was delicious!

The fry bread is so light and a HUGE size. I had enough carbs for the night.

Definitely get to this restaurant before it closes at 7pm!!!"}
{"text":"What happens when you take bad Mexican food, and replace all the tortillas with delectable fry bread?  You get The Fry Bread House.

I stopped in FBH after a long time hearing about how great this place is.  After all, it is a James Beard award winner.  The menu left me immediately underwhelmed.  I went with the chorizo combo, which has sausage, beans, lettuce, and cheese inside of a folded piece of succulent fry bread.

The chorizo was OK.  All the other toppings were mediocre - the lettuce and cheese didn't exactly seem like the freshest lettuce and cheese I've tasted. 

The drink selection was weak.  They only offer fountain drinks, for which you have to pay $0.80 for a refill. (I don't care about paying an extra $0.80 for some cheap liquid, but it's awfully inconvenient!)  How about offering some Mexican Coke or something?

I believe I've already mentioned how delicious the fry bread is.  But it's fry bread.  I haven't had *disgusting* fry bread yet.  Food trucks and various off-the-food-inspector-radar sidewalk stands in the ghetto have awesome fry bread, too.

Go here for awesome fry bread.  Just don't try to make a meal out of it, or you may find yourself severely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I arrived at 7:25pm and waited in line this evening for over 15 minutes for your staff to only take the order of one person in that time frame.   Some lady who is just standing around instead of helping take orders from the waiting customers states at 7:45pm , \"everyone after him (the man ordering) has to take their order to go.\"   This is extremely poor customer service!"}
{"text":"They should call this place \"The Soup Nazi\" because its exactly like that episode of Seinfeld. The stew and frybread are amazing but the service is F-ing horrid. It almost seems like they intentionally hire the rudest, grumpiest people to work the register. The frybread is a good size and made to perfection but the \"bowl\" of stew is more like a cup of stew....the portion they give you is OK for my 4 year old but not a grown man. The taco is good but they charge the heck out of your wallet for additional toppings...lettuce, onions, tomatoes etc. Its a good place to eat if you enjoy being frowned upon by staff and treated sub human! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Indian fry bread! I always get the bean and cheese fry bread-my favorite! The best I've had in Arizona!!!!
Very friendly and polite. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The bean and cheese fry bread was good I experinced good service thats all I have"}
{"text":"I love this place... I am a southwesterner to the bone, languishing in California, and whenever I am back home to visit, this is my first food stop. The menu is simple and straightforward -- mostly fry bread, pozole, and chili... indian tacos, sweet fry bread, stew... plain home food, excellently prepared. Ambience is quiet and unpretentious, the service is fast, the prices are great. Parking can be a problem, but it's worth walking a couple of blocks.

Faves:

plain ol' fry bread"}
{"text":"Our first time trying fry bread and boy were we surprised by how unique and delicious it is. We hope to go back to this location before we leave town. I got the ultimate fry bread with green chili beef and it was so good, but a huge portion. We also tried a tamale, a friend corn taco with the best tasting ground beef we've ever had in a taco, and a butter, cinnamon, and sugar desert fry bread that was oh so tasty. Service was good and prompt!"}
{"text":"This is my go to fry bread place if I'm not making it myself.   This weekend was the Heard Museum market event  and the fry bread line was a bit long and $7 for a plain fry bread. Nope. Not today. I can score a whole bag of flour for $7 and make my own bread,  next best option was to come here and spend the same amount of money for bread WITH toppings. Yes, toppings. Sorry Sacred Hogan, I went to Fry Bread House. Oh, and parking is a premium, but i managed to shove my truck between the dumpster and a small car."}
{"text":"Gross.

Flies all over the dining room. Ripped up upholstery. Big divots in the floor where  structural elements were removed and never patched.

Now the food.  I ordered the ground beef taco. The meat had absolutely no seasoning and was oily. The fry bread was not fully cooked and oily. The scant bit of lettuce that was put on the taco was wilted and brown. And the salsa the counter attendant raved about we couldn't try because the ketchup type bottle they put it in was sealed shut with gunk.

2 bites in and we left. Waste of money and now I have a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Whoo Hoo!  Congrats on your James Beard Award, Fry Bread House!!!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good...the fry bread could really melt in your mouth...it was that good!  I had driven by this place so many times and finally stopped in yesterday.  I can't tell you how much I have been missing the past 6 years!"}
{"text":"Yum!  even though it is incredibly heavy and bad for you- YUM.  we got the beef and hominy stew with fry bread and the ultimate taco.  let's start with the stew- though it was just beef and hominy, the broth was so tasty and delicious.  didn't even need the fry bread on the side.  the ultimate taco was pretty awesome- we got the red beef chili and then it had refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  it definitely wasn't gourmet but it was so delicious and so cheap!  gluttonous, but worth it.  we wanted to get a dessert fry bread, but we were just way too full to even go there."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Lanta!!

So, Kelly A. and I ended up finally going here and we loved it! This place is small, the food is deliciously greasy, the portions are hearty and the staff is great! Since it was our first time here, we had questions. I absolutely enjoy it when you can go into a restaurant, ask about the food and get an honest and happy response! After the questions came to rest, there were two recommendations that we went with: the green chile and the chocolate and butter covered fry bread...let me just say that there is something truly magical about chocolate and butter on fried dough. There was definitely instant guilt but also instant bliss! That being said, the food here is just tasty!

Fry Bread House is definitely a local spot for locals. There isn't as much press as I would expect and I don't think I've ever seen it in a travel guide to Phoenix. It's truly a little gem and I am a fan."}
{"text":"First time here and will be back. The green chili stew special was very spicy - just how I like it. Green chili taco was tasty as well but not as spicy. Overall, the service was quick and the food delicious!"}
{"text":"Good.  Not bad.  Not great.

Tastes just like a fry bread that you get at any casino or street fair, ect.

I had the Indian Taco with beans, cheese and lettuce.

My three kids split two of the Tacos with ground beef, beans, cheese and lettuce.  We threw some food away and only spent $21."}
{"text":"I've been a regular visitor at the Fry Bread House at four locations over the years.  I quite like their green chili combo fry bread.  The green chili is consistently serviceable and the fry bread, excellent. 

But it is time this needs to be said: Fry Bread House, stop putting a 10\"-12\" fry bread on a 6\" plate!

Serving a sloppy fry bread (with a knife and fork) on a piece of yellow paper on top of an undersized plate just pretty much guarantees you're going to eat some paper. 

The paper does not taste good.  Let's put an end to this game. 

I enjoy everything else, though."}
{"text":"Mmm green chile taco was delicious. We will absolutely be back. Friendly cashier. Building is old but I hear they are moving into a new place soon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go try this place, but what a difference customer service can make. Debbie who was working the counter was very friendly to the customer in front of me, but her attitude and demeanor changed with me. She walked away in the middle of still taking my order and checked her cell phone, answered questions and talked with other staff. I continued to stand there waiting to pay. FINALLY the other girl came over and rung up my order. $17.25 for two drinks and a plain cheese and 1 bean and cheese fry breads. I thought that was ridiculous. The gentleman with the long braid walks up and just puts down our food and walks away. He came back by and I asked him for a napkin and all he did was point to the back of the restaurant without speaking. I couldn't wait to get out that place. I did find the fry bread to be good. The beans were not hot and the cheese never melted. I considered this a long drive for NOTHING but a waste of $17.25."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, but this is seriously one of Phoenix's best kept secrets. I'm Native American so I grew up on frybread and I was floored when I found out a whole restaurant was devoted to celebrating it. Also, it's Tohono O'odham owned and operated so that gets huge points in my book. I really don't think I could stand the idea of a \"fry bread house\" being run by anyone but Natives. The beef stew and hominy are choice, and all come with fry bread. This place may very well be a future heart attack coming on, but I'll die with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"We had takeout. It was BOMB. We had ultimate tacos, hominy soup, and a bean and cheese taco. So much food. Great prices. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great food! Love going here for the Indian tacos of course, but they also have one of the hottest green chili stews out there. There is nothing on the menu I don't like, native food is the perfect comfort food especially to those of use away from home in the city. Satisfied returning customer :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. We have been going to eat here for about 10 years. The quality is in the food. Not in the location. Remember, it's Native American not fine dining. It is a James Beard award winner in 2012. Give it a try? Dig in..."}
{"text":"Of course it's delicious. It's fry bread! Way better here than at the fairgrounds. The location is small and quaint. The set up is awkward though, as you walk directly in there is a high counter where you place your order. There aren't any signs with the different types of fry bread they offer. Instead, a couple of menus on the cluttered counter top and  grumpy large man behind the counter. 

When ordering, we said \"We're going to have 2-the bean/cheese and the honey/ powdered sugar, please.\" Mr. Grumpy didn't say a word as he poked at the register. He spit out our total, around $17, while walking to the back to place the order. When he returned I said \"$17 seems like a lot, is that right?\" He looked at me like I was a total moron and said \"Yeah..it IS right. You got two beans/cheese and two honey/sugar!\" Correcting him I said \"Oh, no. We wanted just one of each, please.\" He actually rolled his eyes at me and went in the back and angrily crossed off an order on the paper he had just delivered. Shocked by the horrible customer service I said, \"sorry for the confusion\". He looked at me, clearly annoyed - how dare I not order properly - and just said my new total. Yikes!

The food came quickly. The beans were average, not too flavorful and the cheese plentiful. The red bottles the tables with salsa of some sort wasnt too bad. The desert fry bread was much more tasty. Perfectly crisp, I'm going to try the one with butter next time! Yum!

I would've given this place 5 stars if the set-up was better (would love a clearly labeled menu in plain sight) and the awful customer service (Mr. Grumps). In a small, family owned restaraunt-word of mouth is your only chance at repeat and new customers. After reading other reviews, I'm not the only one to have had this same experience. 

I'll be back...but hopefully someone else will be working the front counter."}
{"text":"Heart attacks on a plate

HOWEVER

Its SOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!

:)

I love the plain frybread
or the frybread with chocolate and butter
or the frybread tacos with chorizo, cheese and refried beans

Mmmmm!!!

They also have awesome menudo and tamales.  Love it."}
{"text":"This was amazing.  Wow, I had the green chile taco, chips and the white stew.  I'm only in the area for 4 days, I will be at this spot everyday!

Going to bring my NASA friends too!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Fry Bread as the bread itself was very delicious especially when topped with beans and cheese with the bread being an above average size.  Prices have gone up as a Fry Bread with bean and cheese will run you $6.28 after taxes and if you want to add a drink to that you can count on at least another $2.00.

For me the price isn't worth coming back on a regular basis.  The beans didn't have much taste but you can add salt and salsa to your bread if you want to add more taste.

Overall, if you are in the mood for some fry bread this is a good place to get a quick fix.  Although, I would have to say that the fry bread sold annually at the State Fair taste much better.

Special note, they have a child's size fry bread with bean and cheese with a drink for $3.95 plus tax.  Interestingly, the child's size is not too much smaller than the full size.  

So if you want to save some $$$ you can always order take out and get the child's size fry bread !"}
{"text":"The service is getting faster which is great as I can' wait to get my food once I order.

On my last visit I went with the vegetarian taco, it was good but had a bit too much sour cream for my liking,

 After killing off  bottle of hot sauce my coworker ordered the chocolate and butter fry bread for a heart attack and desert. 

I tasted it and to my surprise the fry bread goes well with sweet as well as savory. I then tried some hot sauce on it. IT WORKED chocolate and the sweet spice of their sauce are a magical combo.  

Try it, then call me crazy."}
{"text":"It's...meh. The red chili and beef 'taco' looked great, like most of the pictures. But, it came to me barely warm. It really ruined the experience. I had the posole to take home with some fry bread. Overall the posole was ok, not good or great. Seemed and tasted either over cooked or old. Really not good and will not be returning.

I say all of this having been raised in New Mexico where there are lots of examples of great Indian/Mexican.  I'll stick with Richardson's and Frank & Lupe's."}
{"text":"The Fry Bread House in Phoenix has long been one of my culinary meccas. Many people envision fry bread as a junk food relegated to carnivals and county fairs. However in the hands of masters like these found near Camelback and 7th Ave in Phoenix, the fry bread realizes its true potential.

This location has bounced around a few times, but their new place between Indian School and Camelback on 7th Ave is a nice upgrade from the former places. The converted house has a clean modern interior with lots of Native American art and touches.

Your hardest choice is sweet or savory. Most of the menu focuses on various taco combinations including red and green chile beef. The red is delicious with the green being much hotter.

You can add any number of toppings, but the fry bread can only hold so much stuffing before it oozes all over the plate. Fortunately they hide a fork and knife underneath to help sop up the goodness.

The restaurant also offers burritos and native style tortillas which are worth a taste. Their kids menu is also great with mini fry breads for a combination playtime and dinner.

Everything is done well and very authentic. I highly recommend locals and tourists support this unique and native cuisine in the region."}
{"text":"I have never had fry bread. It's hard to describe: perhaps a cross between puri and fried dough a fair. But better than both. This place is operated by Tohono O'odham Nation. It was recently named a James Beard American Classic. No frills, simple digs, this place let's the food stand out. And it does by far. The red chili stew was finger-licking good. Which is impressive since stews are eaten with spoons and typically don't involve licking fingers. I ordered the fry bread with beans, lettuce, and cheese. These are deceptively large and perhaps could fit an infant. I recommend buying a blanket for your infant, so you can eat the fry bread. Places like this make me sad that I don't live in the area. How I yearn to try the rest of that menu!"}
{"text":"Looove fry bread! Om nom nom....

Normally I look forward to state fairs or festival type gatherings to get fry bread, but ever since I had this fry bread there is no need to wait! In fact, the Fry Bread House is much better than any other I have tried, so I skip it unless I am here. I usually get the Indian Taco, which is fry bread with beans, cheese, and lettuce. Big serving..  you will be more than satisfied. Do not forget to try the honey and powder sugar! Amazing and worth the extra calories."}
{"text":"I love traditional native American fry bread and this place does a great job as well.  I ordered the green chilli stew and loved the spicy flavor could not stop eating it and loved dipping the fry bread in the chilli.  My wife ordered the Pozole and loved it, again great natural authentic southwest flavors whats not to love.  The only negatives are non food issues in my opinion.  Limited drink selection, and close far too early for a downtown Saturday night in my opinion (9pm)!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place has the very best Fry Bread in town. It blows the State Fair away by far. The place is small but that is fine it makes it seem more family owned. They really take pride in the food the put out and they give you a lot. The desert fry bread is great also."}
{"text":"This place has always been a kitchen away from my own home for many years. I grew up in the neighborhood and over the years, they have never disappointed! 
There fry bread is always made fresh. And there stews and soups are always delicious.
There have been multiple places over the years, but this place has lasted the test of time.

The new location has a more modern feel to appeal to foot traffic in the area. Way better parking options. Seating is and decor is a well needed upgrade."}
{"text":"This place is just what you would expect!! AUTHENTIC FRY BREAD THAT TASTES GREAT!!
Nice menu with choices for everything... I would come back for sure.. not many fry bread spots in phoenix to choose rom so this is it... PROCES ARE JUST A LITTLE TO CLOSE TO STATE FAIR PRICING TO MAKE HIS A 4 star... still worth trying!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, every single time I am in Phoenix I have to stop here, I have followed it from all its locations. I love fry bread. I usually get the Ultimate Taco but sometimes the red or green chili. But I have a sweet tooth so I usually get the powdered sugar and honey fry bread too. Portions are huge! So, so, good."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Indian fry bread and it was pretty good. If you're a fan of chinese donuts (yow tieu), this is a close cousin to it. 
The  wifey and I both had the hominy soup and it was super filling. Good thing we shared one fry bread as it's so big for both of us.
The hominy soup had huge chucks of lean beef. A full meal in itself. Great mom and pop place. I wish we had more places like this in California."}
{"text":"This is a unique, must-visit spot. The fry bread is good but the real magic is what accompanies the fry bread. The $7.49 special of a 12-ounce stew plus fry bread might be lunch for a normal person, but since I'm an out-of-towner I added another 12-ounce stew.

The green chile stew and the posole were both spectacular, and spicy in different ways. If you have to pick just one go with the green chile.

I also want to add that the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 3 stars! I'm from California and I don't know of any places like this. I've had lots of different posoles. I can make a pretty good one myself but this one.... Omg. So delicious! Probably the best posole I've ever had, even better than my grandmas! And the fry bread is heavenly! We were dunking it in the posole and we also got a desert fry bread with honey, butter and powdered sugar. Bomb.com. Next time I come to Phoenix I'm coming here to get a big fat bowl of posole and some fry bread! Mmmm yummy"}
{"text":"I'm no Dodger fan, but we had to come here after reading about the restaurant on Andre Ethier's blog.  Ethier plays outfield for LA, and he has roots here in Phoenix.  I ordered almost exactly what he ordered, it sounded so good.  And it was!  I don't think I've had better hominy stew. And this was my first time eating anything quite like the fry bread with red chile. I probably made a big mistake ordering so much, but I didn't have any idea there might be a half pound of meat in there. The cooking is high quality, the experience definitely original, and the atmosphere is very comforting, being in a remodeled house.

Alas, there is a downside. I generally have a strong constitution. I eat street food in Mexico as often as I can get there, and usually with no ill effects. But the Ethier special had me reeling. Not in the many-unscheduled-bathroom-trips kind of way, but I felt bad and was belching uncontrollably for about the next 24 hours.

I really like the Fry Bread House.  I'm just not sure it likes me."}
{"text":"Usually I go here and pick up lunch for everyone at work. I have never had a problem till today. The new lady at the register was extremely rude! I said I was paying separate and she said in a very stern and angry voice \"NO! YOU CANT DO THAT WITH PHONE ORDERS!\" Which I don't understand why not  since the food doesn't even get made until you get here to pick it up! Last time I come here! I'm all about customer service and this \"new\" person ruined this place for me!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this placed this past Saturday. We are from Los Angeles and were visiting Phoenix for the Dodger game. My husband and boys all had Indian Tacos. We also ordered two tamales, and I had the Green Chile Stew w Frybread. Everything was delicious and we were left fighting over their yummy frybread. Thank you for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"Food : Fried. Carbs. Cheese. Yum.

Selection: Main specialty and dessert. Sufficient. 

Price: Under ten bucks a pop. Great.

Parking: Sucks! I nearly died after having to park across the street (no room at the inn) via a running jaywalk across the 7th ave midday madness. However, I don't care. Gluttony is so worth it.

Hours are rather limited. Better for me anyway, otherwise I'd have to start popping Lipitor because you'd probably find me here way too often."}
{"text":"The Fry Bread House - oh how I miss thee. Love the Navajo taco's - Fry Bread - beans, lettuce, cheese and their yummy salsa. I always thought it was a little bit pricer than I would have liked - but I loved it either way."}
{"text":"The green curry stew, $5.75, is nicely spiced with hatch chillies, bursting with heat.  With every bite, you will enjoy the lean chopped beef.  The Indian Fried Bread with Butter and Powdered sugar is very fulfilling, $6.49.  I love it.  If you want to spend less, just get the stew and add on the plain fry bread for $7.99, it is called the \"Joedd Special\", and sprinkle your own powdered sugar on it.  I did that previously.  This time, I didn't have any sugar in the vicinity, so I ordered it separately off the menu, and spent $5.00 more.  It was worth it, though.  I definitely will be back to the Fry Bread House. I always visit when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Easily the most unassuming James Beard winning establishment that you will ever visit. A bit of a dive but the best a great place  to get introduced to some of the culinary heritage of our Native friends."}
{"text":"Honey & sugar fry bread, yes. 
Bean & cheese fry bread, yes. 

Forget the interior, it's nothing to write home about and you may even wander a bit to find a table that's been bussed. 
On the upside he fry breads are a generous size, not oily, and really tasty. Winner in my book."}
{"text":"Disappointed 


The Fry Bread House is an unpretentious spot serving fry bread, burritos, tamales, and various other items.

I use to be a huge fan of the Fry Bread House.  However, lately the food has been somewhat disappointing. My lunch group and I were looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat. After noticing that the parking lot at the Fry Bread House was  full we decided to give it another shot. After all with that many cars in the parking lot the food had to be good.

 However, our lunch was a disaster. The Fry Bread we ordered was soggy, greasy, and lacked any real flavor . My lunch companion ordered green chili and it ended up being the worst green chili she had ever received - and that was after sending it back because the original order was wrong. 

My other lunch companion had the red chili fry bread, he said it was okay, but nothing special. I would recommend trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Loooove this place! So much! Best frybread I've ever had in my life. And I've been to a fair amount of pow wows. The green chili frybread taco is my fave! But really everything is good. Every time we go we want to try one of the desserts but we're always too full after our tacos."}
{"text":"I paid a visit to their new spot on 7th Avenue Melrose and ordered takeout on a Saturday evening.  One green chili and one red chili frybread were ordered and took about 10 minutes to receive. I really like the new location and the interior, very comfortable so that the wait wasn't overly intolerable. The staff were very friendly. The frybread itself is absolutely delicious- not greasy and just the right amount of fluffy.  However, for the price they charge for each one I would have preferred more chili filling; it seemed a little stingy, so one star deducted.  The green chili frybread is highly recommended, just the right amount of spice...without a doubt I'll be back to order that one again.  (The red chili is good too, just not as good as that green chili goodness)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Started with the cheese crip, a thin pizza-like dish, fried crust with melted cheese, just awesome.  Then had the Ultimate Taco Fry Bread with green chili, amazing.

Friendly service and surroundings, great food, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Why not 5 stars? The location. I was a little creeped out by the location and the strange building next to it. There were some real sketchy lookin' dudes hanging out over there. Parking lot was kiiiinda small, but we found a spot.

Other than location, it's great! I was craving Indian Fry Bread and Googled restaurants...this seemed like our best bet. I'm so glad we chose it. The fry bread taco was faaaaaantastic (exactly what I was craving), and the posole was AMAZING! I didn't really like the chocolate butter dessert frybread; I'd probably go with honey & powdered sugar next time. 

The decorations were very nice. The customer service was...decent. There was a nice Indian lady outside (despite the sweltering heat) making and selling jewelry. It was nice to look at & if that's your style she had some good prices.

I would definitely go back. However, I might bring a gun or pepper spray next time. Lol."}
{"text":"Yummy fry bread and green chili chicken tamale that was super good, green chile stew is the way to go and a fry bread taco with ground beef we shared everything!!being from Colorado I've had better green chili however it's hard to find in Arizona and impossible in Southern California so felt spoiled to be able to get it here yummy my recommendation indulge"}
{"text":"Super tasty!  I was worried it would be crowded so we got there about 11:45 and it was no problem to order and find a seat,  The staff was super nice and volunteered to cut them in half for us since we were sharing.  I think the Green Chili taco was our favorite, the one with just ground beef was a bit boring.  I'd love to go back and try some others. The dessert fry bread with butter and powdered sugar was awesome.  I didn't like the one with chocolate near as much."}
{"text":"The origins of the Tohono O'Odham people are a matter of debate. Some believe they are descendants of the ancient Hohokam, whose presence in the Phoenix area dates back to the 3rd century AD. Others claim they migrated northward from Mexico three centuries ago. Their modern-day nation with its modern-day political boundaries is in southern Arizona, close to Tucson. And some of its citizens have opened up this totally awesome little shack on 7th Avenue for the rest of us to enjoy. 

Last summer I took a road/bike trip through the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona, and first discovered the joys of something called \"Navajo Tacos\". I actually stopped at a hut, if you can even call it that (it was basically some boards held together by rope) less than a mile south of the Utah-Arizona border in the middle of nowhere. A cute, old, wrinkled Navajo lady made it for me and the very thought of it now makes my mouth water. I couldn't believe that this beautiful invention, which is so truly unique to Arizona, was something I'd never tried before. I was also sad, as I drove away, that I could only get it again by making the 4-hour trek to the Navajo Nation. 

I have no idea if a Tohono O'Odham Taco is the exact same thing as a Navajo Taco. At the risk of offending anyone, I will assume it is not. But let's just say that the Tohono O'Odham Taco does the same thing for me as the Navajo Taco did that sunny July day by the Utah border."}
{"text":"Great fry bread, but what stops this place from getting 4 or 5 stars from me was how ordinary the rest of the taco was.  I ordered chorizo and I think they gave me carnitas instead, but I didnt have the guts to tell them just in case I was wrong.  Who knows, maybe that's their version of chorizo."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Indian Fry Bread house.. so warm and comforting, speaks directly to my heart and my arteries. I only indulge every once and a while but damn these are good. My favorite is the version topped with green chile, lettuce, tomato and cheese, grab a squeezy of salsa and you're set!

Definitely one of those home grown places that you should take out of towners!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Fry Bread...YOU CAN'T!!! I've been coming here for years and it's always fantastic! I liked their old location better than the one that was off Indian School but thing they moved again recently and I haven't been there yet. Service is always good and quick and you food is always piping hot!"}
{"text":"Great food, in a simple setting. I have been a couple of times now and have enjoyed each visit."}
{"text":"Saw owner wipe the tops of the red ketchup bottles with the same rag he used to clean the table. Won't go back."}
{"text":"My husband ate here one day for lunch, and wanted to go back that night for dinner.  It's THAT good!  

I tried it the next day and I would have gone back the same night for dinner, too, if I wouldn't have still been so full.  It is THAT good!!

The front parking lot is tiny, but there is a gravel lot in back, and the dining room is a bit small, so if you plan to eat there around regular lunch or dinner hours you might be better off ordering pick up."}
{"text":"Good grub. Had the bean and cheese and got nice portion size with inexpensive pricing"}
{"text":"Hands down, best fry bread in all of Phoenix. Don't waste your time going anywhere else, I promise you it won't compare to here. I've been eating at this place for the past 13 years(at their different locations) and I swear it's just better every time!"}
{"text":"The fry bread was ok, somewhat tough. The \"Indian taco\" was o.k. But extra dollars for all toppings. Onions, tomatoes, and jalapeños  can't do anything without staff stopping you."}
{"text":"There is no arguing that the Indian fry breads are super delicious, tasteful, hot and enjoyable to eat. I order the bean and cheese  fried bread, which was made to perfection. Beans were just right and why I say that is because if beans aren't cooked or seasoned the right way, it can make a huge difference. 

Make sure to order a large drink of your choice because it isn't one of those self serve soda machines and they charge for refill.  

Ordering food wasn't at my expectation, considering the employee wasn't very pleasant or friendly. 

Now let's talk about the environment which caused me to rate this a 3. Environment is so important to me in a establishment, especially in a restaurant. As soon as we walked in, the employee was cleaning the restroom, mind you the restroom is right in the entrance, so as she is cleaning it, the whole restaurant smelled like cleaning chemicals which is very toxic for my food and the fact that I'm pregnant I wasn't to happy about the smell. It was very unsanitary and a wrong time to clean when the doors had just opened for business that day. 
I'm sure the people felt the same way behind us in line. 

So my experience was ok, but luckily the food was good."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic in my opinion. Busy around lunch. Great service. Order up front then food is delivered to table. Great space for groups."}
{"text":"The Fry Bread House is a tough place to figure out.  We've been to this establishment three times at two locations [they didn't add a 2nd restaurant - it was a relocation], and now according to the lady behind the counter they are moving yet again in February. On our previous visit, they had been open at this property for only 3 months - now they are packing up to move yet again.  I'd rather of course that the Owners find success wherever the are, but maybe deep down I'm kinda just a little bit more hopeful now because I think it'll work out better for the Owners in the long run to take this saloon outa Dodge. This current venue lacks personality and reads more like a big generic cafeteria or meeting hall. The awesome food deserves a better context. We hope The Fry Bread House can find the charm and magic of their first location, where we first waited in a line out the door. 

Their food is fantastic. They won a freakin' James Beard \"America's Classics\" award designation in 2012 - totally true. Google it. It is a very big deal.  I've had their green chili beef stew (awesome), their green chili beef taco with beans (fabulous), and most recently their ultimate fry bread taco with the red chili beef. The green chili is definitely hotter than the red, but the red has great flavors with just the right amount of heat. I love them both but my favorite bite here is always the rich, smooth and oh so decadent refried beans. Love the beans. 

My kids always devour the coyote coins, which are little fry bread circles served with their signature refried beans smothered in cheese. So simple but so good. On our most recent visit my son left the coyote coins to my daughter and had the Cheese crisp on chumuth, which he loved as well. Also very simple. 

Love this place, wherever they locate. Let's all do our part to keep this treasure in business. And thriving."}
{"text":"So as a native Phoenician, I grew up eating fry bread. But here's the deal... the only place you could get it was at the Arizona State Fair (And believe me, my folks would actually plan ASF trips for that very purpose!) or if the Heard had some special event.

What can be said of puffy little pockets of air and chewy goodness fried up in some hideously unhealthy concoction, thereby creating a crispy yum yum shell which you can top to your liking? Holy Mother of God my mouth is watering just thinking about it!

The people are friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the sauce should be nominated as a sixth food group in itself... foodies unite and to hell with diets!!! 

The only downside to this place is that parking can be a nightmare (my sister went once and almost drove over someone napping on a parking block!) But seriously I wouldn't let that detain you from the food inside. : )

Whether you are looking for something veggie to carnivore or sweet and sticky the servings are generous. So put on your big girl pants, head on over to The Fry Bread House and pull up a chair.

love Love LOVE \"The Fry Bread House\""}
{"text":"I wouldn't advise any health nut go here but if you want some cheap super yummy HUGE taco's with frybread wrappers?   Hit it up!

The ladies working were really nice and the price was pretty fair.

I felt like a peace pipe afterwards... no really... okay no I didn't but it was really good."}
{"text":"I love this place, don't let the outside fool you, it's in the \"hood\" to most people,  but to me it's just a midtown city area.

This place as been around forever,  every time I come here, the food is great, consistently great. 

I had the ultimate taco with green chile, hubby had same, but with red chile. We both grubbed. 

And if you feel like shopping,  they have a little area where a Native American art/jewelry is sold.

I even bought a cute bracelet!"}
{"text":"So good and homey the fry bread was light fresh and crispy. We ordered at the register and the food came out pretty fast and hot. The employees are courteous and polite. It's a great casual restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good. I always get bean & cheese frybread so I am not hard to impress at all. Therefore, service is everything to me.

I walked in on a Tuesday at 7pm. They were open, but the open sign wasn't lit up, went inside anyways. I walked to the counter to ordered. FOUR different people looked at me, and walked into the back room. Okay..... The lady that would eventually be the one to take our orders, saw us, and then began organizing and restocking. Eventually, she came to \"help\" us. With no eye contact she took our order. I had she made a 30 second phone call to confirm someone's order and she was very annoyed. She asked if I wanted salsa with my order and I said yes.

The food came out quickly.

When I grabbed my order from a different lady, I asked for some extra salsa. The lady who TOOK my order overheard my request and told me that she already gave me salsa, and I can have 2 more, and THAT'S IT.

Well guess what? You can have one star and THAT'S IT. Worst customer service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Some of the best frybread tacos I have ever eaten.  Strongly recommend the green chili ultimate frybread taco.  The green chili stew is second only to my family's recipe.  Outstanding.  Get there early, it can get busy during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I love chewy flatbread and I love fried foods, so I knew I had to try fry bread while in Arizona. We decided to check out The Fry Bread House on a Saturday night before we headed to the Rockets game. There were people in the restaurant at 6pm, but we were able to order right away. We got:

-Ultimate Taco (Refried Beans w/Spicy Red Chili Beef, Diced Onions, Sour Cream, Shredded Cheese, Lettuce, $7.69, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA): Yum (I stole a bite of my friend's fry bread)! I really liked the spice in the red chili beef, and that the beef was really tender. The fry bread was perfectly cooked, and was crispy but still chewy.
-Ultimate Taco (Refried Beans w/Green Chili Beef, Diced Onions, Sour Cream, Shredded Cheese, Lettuce, $7.69, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#IGaxrR-YU3PsJ6IYjvRHnw): We got the refried beans on the side, and I was really happy we did that since the fry bread itself was really filling. I loved how puffy it was, and the green chili beef had really good flavor. 
-Chocolate & Butter ($4.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-fry-bread-house-phoenix?select=w9ARHJ3G0GpgcvKd2eyGFA#IDu9jkqjvrKF6MlGhZKojA): SOOOO good- a must order if you enjoy sweets/dessert! This fry bread could have used a bit more chocolate, but I loved the combination of the chocolate and butter. 

I really wish they let you do half and half of the red chili and green chili beef. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat an entire fry bread to myself since I also wanted to try a sweet one, so I had to make a decision to choose either the red or the green. I wouldn't mind paying an extra $0.50 or $1 to add the extra flavor, just because I know I won't get to come back for a while. I liked both the red and green chilis, but would probably choose the red over the green just because I like spicy food. I was super full after eating half the ultimate taco and 1/4 of the sweet fry bread; however, two of my friends were able to eat the entire ultimate taco on their own and eat some of the sweet fry bread. The restaurant itself is very hole in the wall-ish, and the building is definitely on the older side. The benches for the tables could have used some cleaning, and the lady taking our order could have been a little friendly, but oh well, have low expectations for that sort of thing when you dine here. Just come for the delicious, fatty, fry bread, and your tummy (and wallet) will be happy! Parking was easy in their lot, but I'm not sure where you would park if the lot was full."}
{"text":"A memorable meal to say the least !!!!!!! When working out of town I discovered this place my last week in town.  The red chili stew meat was amazing !!!!!  The best way to to describe it is for someone to imagine a fresh gordita type tortilla warm and filled with great meat and cheese and veggies.  It's just comfort food at its best. I live in California and every time I hear someone say they are going to Phoenix I tell them this place is w must stop !!!!

Amazing food. Thank you all for memorable lunches while hundreds of miles away from home.  Cheers !!!"}
{"text":"When a friend asked me to meet them for lunch and eat some fry bread, I immediately thought ~ \"is the fair or a carnival in town?\"  No, this is not your carnie type of fry bread, it much better!!

We met at The Fry Bread House and found it to be this little gem of a place that's kind of a hole in the wall.  You must look for the street sign to find them because they are set back off the road and since this is a small place they are kind of hard to find.  Their parking lot is usually full so you may want to park around the side.

Restaurant ~ nothing fancy here but it's very cleaned and kind of 70's dinerish. You walk in and step up to the counter and place your order. There are a lot of regular's and locals that dine here, so don't be afraid to ask one of them about your choices.

Service ~ friendly bunch of folks working here.  Everything is pretty much self-serv.  They are not very green friendly and use lots of plastic and stryo foam.

Food ~ The fry bread and red chili beef stew was very good and I would get it again.  The red chili stew was pipping hot with a very good balance of seasoning that wasn't too spicy and it had a good balance of meat to broth.  The fry bread was a little sweet, very tasty but it was a little too greasy. I know it's fry bread but I thought it would be a little more crispy.  We also had their tacos with beef and a veggie taco.  Both were very good however I should have eaten the taco first before my stew because the meat, beens and yummy goodness inside the taco was too much for the fry bread to hold up to.  It fell apart when trying to pick it up.  

All in all it was a very good experience and I'm looking forward to going back to The Fry Bread House to try an opened faced taco, their green chili stew and some fry bread desert!  Oh my!"}
{"text":"visited from Washington state, and all I can say is we need a frybread house near me!! Its amazing, I will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!

Thank you for the amazing ndn taco!"}
{"text":"As my husband described it, it was a taco wrapped up in a doughnut. Or rather, a burrito in a doughnut. The chorizo is SPICY. Take it easy if you're unsure how hot you like your spicy foods. Loved every bite, although none of us finished ours. Did I mention that it's like a burrito wrapped in a doughnut."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix - great food, huge portions and inexpensive...can you really ask for anything more?

On my most recent visit I had Red Beef Chile over Fry Bread and Hominy Stew with Fry Bread.  

The Red Beef Chile was savory, spicy and seasoned to near perfection.   It had just the right amount of liquid so that it didn't fall through the fry beard, but still retained the right amount of moisture.  My recommendation is to eat this thing fairly quickly and not to nurse this plate...eventually you'll see the beef fat harden and it's something you really want to ignore when you're enjoying such a great meal.

The Hominy Stew was really good.  Usually posole or hominy stews have chile added, which is great, but it was so interesting to get a stew that didn't have that, but still had a ton of flavor.  They didn't skimp on the beef, which is something you'd expect from other places.  The side of fry bread was perfect with the stew and added a bit of substance and heartiness to a great dish. 

I hadn't been there in probably 8 years so it was nice to go back and see the food hadn't changed - actually it was better since there are more options and the décor is nicer (and I think they moved too?).  

This is definitely a place to eat great food if you're visiting or living in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I found the bane of my pregnant existence: a giant slab of fry bread loaded with beans, lettuce, cheese, grilled onion, and sour cream.. also known as the Vegetarian Taco. 

The place isn't too big, and you place your order at the counter and wait for it. The food comes fast though, and when ours did, I gulped in anxiety over how to tackle the taco.. it's h u g e. Just give in, get a pile of napkins [and a moist towelette] and grab that delicious morsel with both hands and understand it's messy. It was love at first bite for me, tasting every ingredient nestled between two sides of one delicious piece of fry bread. 

For dessert, my husband and I split a powdered sugar fry bread, and as he was so full from his green chili beef taco, I got most of it. 

Bring your appetite and leave your Biltmore ladies behind, because hearing how fattening this wonderful place is would be a total buzzkill."}
{"text":"Great native American food options. Friendly service. My kids loved the desert fry bread with the powdered sugar and the honey!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good. However, everything is over-priced and the place is an absolute dump. I also question the cleanliness of this place."}
{"text":"This place is really trying to make a buck off so-so fry bread. I added tomato to my taco and it was a 1.50, that's a lot to me, it's not avocado! Also they won't let you fill your own drinks and only ONE refill allowed. Love the make shift wall around the soda fountain too.  My fry bread was cold along with everything else on it! Yuck, cold beans! Cheese not melted yada yada...the fry bread itself was thin, oily, crunchy with holes in it. I get better fry bread at the fair. I really have nothing good to say, I won't be back unless they actually make good fry bread one day. It's actually not that hard or expensive to make, so I'll just make my own next time. :)"}
{"text":"Ok, I probably shouldn't do it, but I have to put in a review for this place.  Now, the last time I was here was back in 2001, but damn, Yelp wasn't around, and I just have to Yelp a place unique like this (besides, one of my Yelp Friends just Yelped this place and jogged my memories about this Native goodness).  

So yeah, if you're in between pow wows and have a fix for some fry bread, this is the place to go.  I remember having some fry bread here and it tasted excellent.  I also remember totally loving the soups/stews as well.  There are not that many Native restaurants around, so give this one some props!

Shiiiiiiiiiiiiii.  I think I need to plan a trip to Phoenix this very minute, innit?!  

Aieee!!!!"}
{"text":"Similar to others, enjoyed the fry bread with honey or cinnamon. I don't find the interior \"charming\" or quirky. It's a DUMP. Bad booths and old floors, poor lighting. Needs a make over.  Wouldn't try any meats this place offers."}
{"text":"As a fry bread \"noob,\" I'll err on the side of caution and chalk most of my dislikes up to unfamiliar, lest I make anybody angry by sullying what seems to be somewhat of a Phoenix institution.  Still, I will say that I was not absolutely astounded by the food or the prices, both of which most reviewers have raved about.  Fry bread itself is something akin to a fluffier fried version of Indian naan, and can be ordered with a wide variety of savory or sweet toppings.
I had the chili combination taco with green chili sauce, and while it was good, it was nothing spectacular -- I've had mexican dishes with more interesting flavor.  Still, the fry bread itself was fluffy and delicious.
When I saw menudo -- beef tripe stew -- listed on the menu, I decided I should definitely give it a try, having never eaten tripe before.  The tripe was a lot less chewy that I was expecting, and a good contrast to the almost crunchiness of the hominy, but the stew as a whole was largely flavorless, and just plain salty.
I would definitely give this place another go, and try the sweet fry breads, I saw a couple get one for desert and it looked awesome."}
{"text":"I guess there really isn't much left to say but \"ditto,\" but I've loved the Fry Bread House for years and just couldn't resist adding my 2 cents.

I try and I try and I TRY -- but I just can't make fry bread like they do here! The basic recipe for fry bread is so simple (flour, water, oil) you'd think it would be a piece of cake. 

But the freindly folks at Fry Bread House obviously know something I don't. Maybe it's the fact that they are native Tohono O'odham Nation members, and I am SO white (as my exchange student son so often reminds me)...

Anyway, check it out for absolutely the best comfort food to be had this side of a heart attack. And I mean that in the best possible way.."}
{"text":"Everything Fry Bread House serves up is incredibly delicious. 
I like the unpretentious service, and the salsa that comes with the tacos is pretty addictive!

This is probably a bad place to be a vegan. I'd love to see some bison and lamb added to the chili menu, but the beef is pretty tasty the way they serve it up. There are two kinds of chile -red or green. Both are delicious.

The fry bread is perfect all by itself and I have ordered veg tacos here before and they were pretty tasty too.

Yum!"}
{"text":"We went a few weeks ago after finding out about The Fry Bread House on Yelp.  I ordered the green chili stew and a fry bread and my Hubby had the menudo (or was it pasole? I can't remember) and a fry bread.  It was good.  I'm giving it a three because......... I grew up in north east AZ, a few miles from the \"REZ\", I have grown up eating the best of the best.  In fact, I can cook it myself pretty darn good.  I enjoyed what I ate, so much I kept craving it.  I ended up cookin up a big meal at home with the kids, and I enjoyed what I made a lot more.  It just had so much more flavor.  This is not common for me, I usually enjoy restaurant food much more than my own.  So, as a recommendation, go there! It is very good!"}
{"text":"Best Fry Bread in Arizona, same style as the StateFair Fry Bread."}
{"text":"Fry Bread is really a lot like fried dough, but this restaurant takes it to a whole new level. My favorite is the beef and vegetable stew, but they have tacos and dessert stuff too. All centered around fry bread of course. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. There is not wait staff. You order and they call your name.The night that I went most recently was a busy night because of a fair that was happening on 7th ave, so the food took about 10 minutes, but usually it's pretty prompt."}
{"text":"Met up with the International Supper Club at The Fry Bread house to give them a try, I have been meaning to check them out for a while now and glad that I finally got to! 

The 1st thing I noticed was there were plenty of signs telling you that they are moving soon, well dang it, I finally get here and they are moving! But it's not too far from this location, so don't freak out too much.

The menu is on the wall and it's pretty simple to follow, so when it was my turn to order I went with the ultimate fry bread taco with red chili. Took my number and headed off to our table.

One person in our group also got chips and salsa, and let me tell you, their salsa, its amazing! Great in flavor, I mean I could just make a meal out of there fresh fried chips and salsa, so good!

Order came out to the table and I have to say ITS HUGE!!! I mean HUGE!  It was fry bread the size of a plate, loaded with beans, beefy red chili, cheese, lettuce, sour cream folded in half, I swear I didn't know how to attack this thing, it is def something you eat with a fork.

The red chili is soo good, this fried bread taco was amazing, I couldn't believe I ate entire thing! So good, in fact I want another!

Another person in our group ordered the fry break with chocolate and butter, offered a piece for me to try, and man that too was simply amazing it was real melted chocolate and warm melted butter, oh that was sweet bliss!

If you haven't been to the Fry Bread House, you should go! I look forward to checking out the new place next month!"}
{"text":"the simple idea of this fine establishment not having at LEAST a four star review is an atrocity. who are you people? the food is amazing and definitely not your average meal - at least in all my travels i have not seen many authentic native american fry bread restaurants. and it is delicious.. my recommendation is the green chile beef taco because thats all ive had. its a confusing and enormous place in there, kinda feels like the DMV but the food is soo good and the employees are wonderful and so kind."}
{"text":"Okay I have come around, the Fry Bread House rocks! maybe I just went on a bad night or something...anyways after a few hours of trekking in the Heard Museum, we became very hungry looking at all of food and more specifically, fried food exhibits. Knowing that this place is Tohono O'odham Nation family owned, it was a no-brainer to stop in here for our fry bread cravings. You can see the women in the back stretching out the dough getting it ready for its hot oil bath.

I recommend you take your time to order because there is so much to choose from. They also want you to shut your trap on your celly while ordering, so please put it away in the name of order accuracy. Why do you have to be so fattening fry bread?? Why??!? Tasty fillings and the  bread itself is slightly chewy without being too chewy, and has a fried, fresh, goodness about it. Try the red cream soda, it ties it all together."}
{"text":"Th food was awesome! Red chili taco frybread was awesome. The inside is run down and could use a face lift but the food more than compensates."}
{"text":"Hmm... I'm not sure what I was expecting from my first taste of Native American food but, my Navajo Taco from The Fry Bread House was did not live up to any ideas I had.  The fry bread is good enough... of course, anything you deep fry is usually tasty but, the taco was super bland and nothing interesting.  It basically was fried bread with lettuce, beans and some cheese slapped in it.  :-/

When I add the lackluster food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friendly at all... rude actually, I don't have a very satisfied feeling about my experience.  My friend was trying to order the stew and some fry bread and the man treated him like he was dumb for not knowing that you have to order a combo to get both.  Then, when we ask what drinks they had, the man kinda rolled his eyes and pointed to a sign... again, like we should have already know where the sign was or what their options were.  Really?  We walked in and right up to the counter so we didn't have much chance to familiarize ourselves with their exact set-up.  I almost said something but, didn't want any chance of retaliation in our food. 

So, my friends stew was full of flavor and my taco had none.  The only saving factor was the dessert fry bread at the end... 

I'd go back to try other things if friends invited me again but, I might try to find a different fry bread location since the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescending at this one.  

Prolly won't see ya there."}
{"text":"Good food but they are definitely not concerned with the level of customer service they provide. We used to come every week during our lunch break and bring it back to the office to eat and then all of the sudden they stopped letting us place separate phone orders claiming it was \"a huge inconvenience for them\". So as long as you keep your customer service expectations low, you'll be fine with the service provided."}
{"text":"I love this place, been there twice and the food is fantastic. Building appearances may be deceiving but the food is excellent and I'm telling you, you must give it a try. The Green Chili Stew is top notch and the Navaho Taco's are great as well, but the fry bread is 100% A OK

The only issue I have is that they are closed on Sunday's, but I guess everyone deserves a day off."}
{"text":"I love fry bread and this place is as authentic as a restaurant can be!!!! 

Indian tacos are my favorite and for dessert I love the honey and sugar fry bread. Usually I have to share dessert and don't eat for a few hours prior to my visit. 

The people are friendly- but it's a bit confusing as to if you leave your dishes or put them somewhere. Feels like a small mom and pop place... Not many signs and tables broken etc. they are moving soon (still) so that could be why. 

I love the food and the food is phenomenal!! I think with a little more attention on ambiance and service they would be jam packed all the time. 

Must try if you're in Phoenix !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to finally trying authentic fry bread for years and finally had the opportunity to do so today at The Fry Bread House. I wasn't disappointed - it was fantastic! My husband and I shared a plain Indian Taco and a Red Chili Indian Taco and my kids tried (and loved) the UFO's, which were silver-dollar sized fry breads with a side of refried beans for dipping. 

While it wasn't the healthiest meal, it sure was a tasty once-in-a-while treat. The fry bread was light and fluffy and not greasy at all. The red chili beef was very flavorful with a moderate amount of heat (they serve hot sauce on the side). 

I don't know where to get fry bread like this where I live in San Diego, so it was an extra special treat to enjoy it here in Phoenix. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Fry Bread House since they moved from 7th Ave. and Indian School to 10th St. and Indian School. I used to LOVE, I mean absolutely LOVE it. Today's experience was awful, though. They must have left the recipe back at the old joint (lol). Today I got the hominy stew with a plain fry bread on the side. Usually this stew is absolutely delicious. The meat has always been very tender and flavorful. Today, the meat was very tough and hard.  The stew had no flavor, whatsoever. It was very bland. Just nasty.The fry bread didn't even taste good. It was VERY greasy. I was not impressed at all with my visit. My husband also said that he visited a couple of weeks ago as well and also noticed that the food wasn't as good as it usally is. I don't know, maybe they need some time to get back into the groove of things but I definitely won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"I will always think of this place as \"Ponchos\", even though it hasen't been there forEVER.

I walked in and it's pretty spacious, it was just about 11am so it wasn't busy. Right away I noticed the ugly sheets hanging to block the view of the kitchen. Honestly it just looks tacky and needs to be changed. An employee was cleaning the bathrooms and greeted me as I waited in line to order. The employee taking my order was nice enough.

I got the Green Chili Taco and a Lent tamale. The outside of the frybread was good. But the all that gooey green chili basically tore through the frybread because it was so thin. Not good. The chili itself was egh. The lent tamale which had corn and chili was better. But they were just reheated in the microwave before being served. I observed the cashier tell the cook who was reaching for the refrigerator that \"there's one more Lent.\" It was okay I guess, the outer edges of the masa was a bit hard from being reheated to long... sigh... It just isn't the same when they were at the old tiny place.

The also had a Marketplace for Indian jewelry. I didn't walk over becuase they tend to be overpriced. But it was in the other half of the seating area with a little handwritten sign over the door way. Between the marketplace and kitchen I guess was the \"cleaning supply area\", all their supplies were in plan view becuase the sheet was pushed and held to the side. It just doesn't look good. 

It may seem like a step up into a bigger place, but its actually a step down."}
{"text":"If you are on a diet, don't come here. It's too tempting! My friend and I had our last meal in Phoenix here, and we shared a chocolate and butter fry bread. It was fantastic! So gooey, but the chocolate was delicious!

There are a ton of other options, ranging from savory to sweet. I went during lunch, so a lot of people were getting fry bread with beans and meats.  Prices are very reasonable, but be prepared to wait if the line is out the door. Seating is very limited, so if you have a big party you'll have to keep that in mind.  

Based on the one meal I had, it was great. I would have liked to try the other ones, but I was too full (and feeling way too guilty!)

BTW- They are closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Yummy stuff. I can only comment on the dessert ones and in my opinion it is the best fry bread. Love to treat myself whenever I can."}
{"text":"today, i had to find out if i actually like fry bread or not. there are only two occasions upon which i eat it: when i hike havasupai and at music festivals. i like it on both occasions, but i'm not sure i can judge whether i like real fry bread based on these experiences.  so, off a coworker and i to the fry bread house, where i learned i really do love fry bread ... especially the chorizo taco variety. 

the chorizo fry bread taco was presented on a styrofoam  plate and wrapped loosely in paper. the massive taco is full of  fat, calories and general weight-gain potential. don't get me wrong, it tasted amazing, but i couldn't stop thinking about how many hundreds of calories i was consuming. one taco is probably large enough for two people to split. the house hot sauce, served in large, red bottles, is tasty -  ask for a bottle when you pick up your food. all in all, this was a seriously tasty lunch. i will definitely be back, but it won't be very often."}
{"text":"OK. Food was good, couldn't help but stare at all the awkward seating arrangements. Seating area needs a little TLC. I also feel it necessary to say if a customer asks for water, I suggest bringing each table a pitcher as opposed to little itty bitty styrofoam cups that I\they have to get up to refill every 2 minutes.. . Makes me feel little tacky. If they're worried about people filling the cups up with soda instead of water they should change the area of the soda. Lemons are 1.29 for a half a lemon cut up in thirds..(could resist)  Lmbo #detailsmatter 
There is a native table next door if you want to purchase jewelry or dream catchers. Enjoy the food try not to stare at all the damaged seats\ booths\ statues\ Tables. Staff was friendly and maintain customers as they came in well."}
{"text":"I order the green chli taco. Still as good as I remember. I do miss the old location on 7th ave. the new place has an awkward layout and  the tables are all mismatched. Also the fry bread taco did seam a bit smaller than I had before at the old location.  The food is great though and it you don't mind a weird dining area then I recommend"}
{"text":"In my first visit to the new location, the food was as good as I remembered from a too-long ago visit to the tiny and now closed 7th Ave location.  I was hungry and pleasantly surprised at how both tasty and filling was but a single bowl of the hearty beef stew and a plain fry bread ($8). The fry bread was fresh and warm, lightly oily, easy to tear into strips, and delicious, with a light, tender texture.  It's walk-up counter order & pay.  Staff then delivers your food on plastic tray, and clears your table after.  The hodge-podge of different style tables, chairs, and booths left over from the location's former occupant, \"Pancho's\", fills the dining room.  Nothing fancy but it works okay. 
  
Off the main dining room a sign designates the attached room \"Indian Market\" and invites the guest to purchase direct from Native American artists. Inside, two Native American women and the daughter of one displayed their jewelry of turquoise, silver, and more on a couple folding tables under too-dim lighting in this, the old Pancho's Mexican Buffet on the south side of Indian School across from Panda Express - and just diagonally across and down the street from \"the other\" well-known fry bread place in town.  I hope the proximity of the two locations is not too damaging to either

It occurred to me that given the size of this place, that with time this could become a happening restaurant and Native American gallery/cultural center. Before that could happen however, there's some  sprucing up to do.  It's an old building that shows considerable wear, and the restaurant was not as clean as it should have been on this occasion: my arm stuck to the first table I sat at, one men's room stall was without TP, and the other had mounds of it on the floor (though was otherwise reasonably neat and clean). To their credit,  the sticky table was cleaned immediately on bringing it the attention of the young woman at the counter.  She also said she would alert someone to the mess of paper on the floor of the larger stall and explained they were having trouble with the ancient toilet paper dispensers unraveling paper to the floor.  
Four stars for the food and the pleasant and competent woman at the counter. She was also both friendly and competent in taking orders, answering questions about the food, and running the register.  Minus one star for what I hope are temporary less-than optimal conditions, but the food was very good and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a must try in PHX! Fun, funky, good and locally owned place that takes fry bread and"}
{"text":"My go to fry bread place! Always busy, especially during lunch! But if your looking to satiate that Indian fried bread craving, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing!
I had both the bean & cheese on fry bread, and also the chocolate on fry bread!!!
They both were delivered quickly after ordering, and the staff is very friendly!!!
Must try if you are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"They have a sign saying closed and moved. I think up on 7th ave now. Close to old place but across street."}
{"text":"Came in today to try something different usually get the green chili stew which is the best.  So I tried the posole been awhile since I had any but wasn't impressed.  Should of stuck with the green chili, the posole didn't have any flavor and hominy tasted old."}
{"text":"A local business recommended this to us, otherwise I would not have stopped. Curb appeal isn't the strong suit, and neither is the decor. However the food was tasty and the servers were super friendly. I enjoyed it, and would come back again. Be brave and check it out."}
{"text":"Went in here right before lunch to try it out. Got an Indian Taco (which doesn't feel PC but since it's owned and staffed by Native Americans, I guess they can call it what they want) with a drink for just over $5. The fry bread was super soft and not really greasy (like I expected, it being fried and all) with really fresh beans, melted cheese, and lettuce. For having no meat and just being a single taco, the prices are a little steep, but for being a small locally owned restaurant downtown, you can't expect Taco Bell prices. Nice staff, clean building."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Read the reviews and knew I had to make a visit. The place was small, had plenty of parking, and had a  few jewelry vendors outside. Service was friendly and pretty quick with our orders. The ultimate taco with green chili sauce was sooo good. The bread was tasty- fried perfectly and was such a large portion. Try the ground beef taco as well, if you're not into saucy. The hominy stew was good- simple but flavorful. Sodas come with free refills. (wish I noticed the sign before ordering a 'Large') Their large is HUGE and comparable to a 2 person family sized portion? Lol I don't know how to describe it but large was definitely an understatement. 

The food here definitely hit the spot and the next time I'm in Phoenix, I will HAVE to stop by!"}
{"text":"Fry bread... red chili.... Worth the drive.

When I did a drive on my own to Phoenix, thank god for the gps for pointing me out to this place. Just thinking about the light fried bread soaking in the red dammit I'll fly back"}
{"text":"So delicious renovated space is so cute and modern and comfortable my daughter like the kids menu and menudo was bomb !!"}
{"text":"Who cares if the interior ain't pretty? The food here is to die for and the staff is so sweet. I talked to the lady at the counter for 10 minutes about thrift stores in the area and my food came out pretty quick. Its a huge portion for the amount, so just order 1 taco if that's what you're getting (you can even share..I'm not joking its a TON of food). I got the refried beans, definitely going to try the chorizo next time."}
{"text":"Been here only once but the place was packed.
A fried dough covered in various chillis or taco ingredients. 
I had the green chili. Absolutely terrific and the green salsa served alongside was fantastic.
This place is a new must return joint for us."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place!!  Great menu - lots of Home made choices!  Service is good a restaurant is clean and quaint."}
{"text":"Very popular spot it seems!  The line was super long on a Saturday afternoon.  It was worth the wait because the fry bread with butter and powdered sugar was delicious!  Will visit again if I am ever in town."}
{"text":"If you really insist on having a stroke from the amount of fat in your diet, you can't do better than the Fry Bread House. Now you all need to know that I'm from California and we never had fry bread before we came to Arizona--but I discovered that I really like fry bread, like once a year or so.

The Fry Bread House has a decent menu of traditional Arizona Indian foods, including posole, mutton stew and yes, fry bread. It's also a gathering place for urban and 'rez' Indians alike...in a homey atmosphere.

Thank goodness they also have tortillas though! Because fry bread is just packed with lots of fat, salt and flour--not good if you're on a low-fat diet.

Now if they would just add acorn stew to the menu--I'd eat there every week regardless of the sucky parking."}
{"text":"Made to order fry bread with all sorts of toppings (reminiscent of Mexican food). The bread is deep fried, of course, but it wasn't dripping with oil. Instead it was light, airy and fluffy. As you order you can see the kitchen, they were making refried beans, red chili sauce, fry bread, and soup from scratch. Not a canned food in sight! Some home cooking going on here so its got favor. 

I had their ultimate with beef, lettuce, cheese, beans and sour cream - making my mouth water right now. It was about $8.50 and was so big! An even amount of each ingredient layered on top of the fry bread and folded in half. Good mix of flavors. If you go, go with an empty stomach or after you worked out :) 

I dig it when I go to a local business that serves good food. People were nice and the place was very clean. Not that much seating though and its busy at lunch time. 

I was so stuffed after my meal but I couldn't stop... I ordered the fry bread with powdered sugar and honey. Oh man. Yum."}
{"text":"Based off the of the Yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try. I tried the ground beef fry bread taco, and the boy had the green chile fry bread taco. Mine was very good, his was AMAZING. When I go back I'm definitely getting what he had. 

I also tried the hominy stew based off of what everyone says here, and while I thought it was good, I don't think I'd order it again - it just wasn't my thing. 

To top off an evening of absolute indulgence, we also got a honey & powdered sugar fry bread. It was....mmm. Delicious. Gluttonous. Fantastic.

The staff were great, super friendly. The prices are low, and the portions are huge. Bring your appetite. :)"}
{"text":"I was first exposed to The Fry Bread House during their days operating on Indian School Road. They've since moved to 7th Avenue in the \"suicide lane\" area as I like to call it. I decided that it was time to pay them a long-overdue visit.

Now, one must keep in mind that I've always placed fry bread under the same umbrella as deep dish pizza. When done right, it's good, but it's something that I'd never be able to eat regularly. But occasionally, when the mood strikes to eat something incredibly unhealthy, but yet satisfyingly delicious, this is one of those places that pulls it off quite well.

At this point, I've only tried their red chili beef taco and haven't quite developed the courage to experiment further. The red chili beef is classified as hot, but by the standards of most, it's pretty mild. Ingredients are all good quality, with the fry bread itself being a notch above what you'd find at other places. It's fluffy, it's chewy, and it packs some solid flavor.

If your stomach can handle dessert, I've found that the chocolate and butter combo works well, although there's a variety of other dessert options to choose from if you're more into cinnamon-style. It's also surprisingly much lighter than you'd expect. I was able to finish both my taco and half of the dessert bread quite easily, which is something that I didn't expect to be able to do going in.

I've made a mental note that when I return, it's high time that I finally try the green chili that everyone mentions, to see whether or not I've been missing out.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved from Peoria to Central Phoenix and we were so used to eating at chains whenever we went out, that now we avoid them at all costs. A couple times a week, I check out Yelp and see what great gem we can find next. Last night, I wanted to take my mom and boyfriend out to a relatively cheap dinner. The Fry Bread House sounded amazing! I read a couple reviews that said the man behind the counter was rude, but I pretty much overlooked them. That was a huge mistake, because I received the absolute WORST customer service I ever have in my life. 

We went up to order and the man behind the counter did not smile, did not greet us, did not ask if we had any questions, NOTHING. My mom and I ordered the red and green chile tacos respectively and my boyfriend ordered the taco with ground beef. I have to say that my mom and I did like our food, but it wasn't enough to keep me from despising this place. My boyfriend is not fan of vegetables, onions, or anything really other than meat. He specifically ordered it because on the menu, \"ONLY these ingredients\" (ground beef) is underlined and it says 'without all the extra stuff' or something like that. It sounded perfect to him! 

We sit down to eat our food and he finds that there are many diced onions all over the ground beef. We both go up to the counter and tell him that my boyfriend is allergic to onions and he ordered it specifically because of the verbiage on the menu. He did not say anything; he just went looking through the menu to try to prove us wrong. I said \"I didn't read it, but my boyfriend did.\" He laughed, did not look at us and said \"That's right, he didn't read it!\" in an extremely offensive manner. He is still looking through the menu still and after a while he cannot find anything to prove us wrong! He offers my boyfriend fry bread with beans. We ask if there is a way we can get the ground beef with no onions, and he very rudely said \"If you wanna wait an hour!\" My boyfriend tells him to just make it with cheese thinking it will be somewhat like a quesadilla. The man behind the counter throws his old food away right in front us angrily, and then he tells his employee something. He comes back with fry bread sprinkled with shredded cheese! It's not melted or anything! How is this an equivalent meal? He also gives me about 2.50 back. Of course, it was terrible food. Who would want to eat that? 

My boyfriend was still hungry and I was sick of going up to the counter. It was the worst experience I've ever had at any establishment. Good food will only get you so far, Fry Bread House. We will never be back again and it looks like you're starting to put off a lot of people. You better change or else you will go under faster than you can sprinkle shredded cheese."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! I had the green chile stew with a plain fry bread and I was blown away with how awesome it was. The place is a little run down and there are no lights outside to tell you that the place is even there but it is so worth it. Make sure you get dessert too!"}
{"text":"When I think of Arizona and food I think of Indian Fry Bread. I'm so happy that this full service restaurant exists and that I don't have to go to a stand on a dirt road alongside an Indian tourist attraction to indulge in my fry bread cravings. 

This is a big open restaurant. Service is a bit slow but very kind and friendly. It's definitely a family run operation. 


Alongside their fry bead they also have an American Indian style flour tortilla type bread that they had as a special wrapped around hot dogs. Very unique. 

Green chile. Red chile stews with hominy. Delicious tacos made with the fry bread as a shell. One taco is a pretty substantial order. 

Dessert also features the frybread. You can have it simply dusted with powdered sugar or drizzles with honey and melted butter among many other creative combinations. 

Ahh the versatile and delicious Indian fry bread."}
{"text":"For the past three years I have driven past this little place every day on the way to and from work and I have never stopped it. Today I did and I think I have found my new favorite place. I got the Ultimate Taco with the green chilies and it was delicious!! The beans were fantastic as well. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I had the ultimate taco. It was very delicious and filling. Service was great. 

The place was clean and had convenient parking."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant over 100 times.  I was finally curious enough to give it a try.

Because I had read the reviews here, I knew what I would order for my test lunch.  A simple red chile beef taco.  I went ultimate - all the toppings.

Holy crap!

I hate it when I drive by a gem 100 times without giving it a try.  This is going to be a regular for sure.

It's a 5-star bit of food wrapped in a weak service and marginal cleanliness package.  The table we sat at was sticky, the guy who brought our food dropped it splattering a salsa bottle all over the table.  They give you only 1 see-through napkin for what is a messy meal, and although he said more were available - not handily.  Treat it like a giant immobile food-truck.

I'll make it a to-go place, but I'll be \"to-going\" once a week."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and yummy. Will be back very soon. The ultimate taco is so good with red."}
{"text":"Somebody recommended this place to me a long time ago and now I have been faithfully going here for years. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I had a friend who was homesick for any kind of Native food, and brought her here...she was so happy to see a place actually run by the Tohono O'odham Nation, AND it was absolutely amazing to boot. I always get the \"everything possible on it\" green chile frybread, and they never let me down...so so so good. They spice the meat perfectly and the frybread is to die for...you can't go wrong with any of the frybreads here, ever!"}
{"text":"OMG that is the best fry bread! I was visiting during Memorial weekday and place was closed until Tuesday but I was determined not to leave w/o trying that fry bread and I am sooo glad I did. I ordered the Indian Taco which comes with lettuces, beans and cheese and I also ordered plain with honey. You have to it eat it while is hot; it tastes the best. After finishing one, I ordered another it was so good. Super friendly staff, parking outside the place."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO 1003 E Indian School!!!! They have moved to 7th Avenue South of Camelback Rd. near Joe's Diner. 
Great food, but they keep moving!"}
{"text":"Little slow on the service but my God the food is phenomenal especially the Green Chile Stew (you better like spicy!)"}
{"text":"Before we vacationed to the Phoenix area I did some research on where and what to eat. I was looking for good eats and hidden gems that locals love. And then.... I found FRY BREAD!!! Why are they not making this everywhere in the US. It's like an elephant ear as the bread used for a sandwich, with many option as stuffers for the insides. We ordered the beef and green taco, whoa are these things huge!! I was expecting the same as the Mexican restaurants that they have in Chicago where you order two or 3 small tacos. 

So be warned that 1 fry bread taco = 3 Chicago Mexican Joint tacos

Now that I'm back home, this food is probably the most thought of during my summer, every time I'm at a fair or carnival I'm wishing they had a Fry Bread cart."}
{"text":"Yum! So happy with everything I ordered. Food was great! Service was great! Cute establishment in midtown/melrose district. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best fry bread ever!! I've been here twice and never disappointed. The red Chile fry bread is amazing!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place the boy&I went to when we went to AZ! Ohhhh my goddddd I love Fry Bread, and they make it delicious here! We got the green chili chicken fry bread, supreme Indian taco fry bread, and the butter/chocolate one. Ohhhh emmmm geeeeee so good. So unhealthy, but so delicious. I regret nothing!!!

Green Chili was definitely my favorite... I want some more now :( The butter/chocolate fry bread is SUPER rich. I don't know if I'd get it again, but it was yummy! Hopefully I can make it to AZ sometime and try the other ones..."}
{"text":"Over priced and Under whelmed 

I have never been to a restaurant that wouldn't fix a wrong order. This establishment charged me 7.25 for a tortilla with melted cheddar cheese on it. Then asked for an additional 1.60 for sour cream. This product was not what I ordered yet the supervisor refused to refund or replace it with the correct item. I love getting fry breads at the fair and thought this place would be awesome. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Never a disssapointment. In the past as I read the reviews I see attitude with the employees, but that is gone with the sister running the place. My guest and I had a wonderful experience and everyone was very helpful and friendly.

We ordered the beef and vegetable stew and powder sugar fry bread.

The beef was wonderful and a little bite to iy. Dip your fry bread and you would be in heaven. My guest also really enjoyed her vegetable stew which she commented was very flavorable.  My only complaint would be the quantity which could be more for the price.  I felt like the bowl and quantity were too small. Maybe because it tasted so good.

Now the best part of all is the Fry bread with powder sugar and honey. I can only say I went back for seconds.

Definitely worth the 20 mile drive and we will be back."}
{"text":"When I was living in NYC I attended a nation wide food award event. The Fry Bread house won an award that night. When I moved back to Phoenix I decided to look them up and try the food. I had never had a savory fry bread before so I had nothing to compare it to in that sense, but it was delicious. I have had the fry bread covered in sugar and honey, and their version is excellent. I have only been to the old location which was limited seating, but I've heard they moved to accommodate their rising popularity."}
{"text":"what a great surprise and I wished we didn't stop in after having lunch cause there was more than a few savory things i would've love try with the navajo fry bread. it was so good that it made me look for it in California which is super hard to find.

interesting story of the navajo fry bread which has a similarity with matzo bread."}
{"text":"A local HIT!  It was a delightful \"hole in the wall\" restaurant, like finding a hidden treasure  We noticed a lot of locals, so knew that was a plus!  Ordered the Indian Taco, Red Chili Taco, and the Green Chile Stew.  The fried bread tasted like a savory funnel cake.  So word to the wise, do not order when you are super hungry...my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach.  The portion is huge, so I think one taco wouldve satisfied my hunger.  One thing I regret was not making room for a dessert one.  However, I did peep out someone else's order and it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to checking out the new location of the Fry Bread House on 7th avenue and finally made our way in last week. I ordered the green chili beef taco and my husband ordered a red chili burrito. I was a bit sticker shocked looking at the $8 price for one taco but when it came out I understood, the thing was huge! The fry bread was super tasty and fluffy and the green chili stew was flavorful and not too spicy. My in laws tried the stew alone and loved it and ordered a fry bread with powdered sugar and honey for dessert, YUM! Service was friendly but it did take a while to get our order in and sat. Good value for the price, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've written it before and I'll write it again, I feel spoiled here. As I said, we only get fry bread when there are powwows, which don't happen as often as I wish they would. What's more, people tend to treat the freshly made fry bread like it's a tostada shell and throw it away when they've eaten the meat, cheese, and vegetables. 

At Fry Bread House, owned and operated by members of the Tohono O'odham Nation, I can get so many more toppings than just ground beef or powdered sugar. 

Oh my god. Green chile beef with beans and cheese. Yes. 

The boyfriend got chorizo, and my mom, who'd never had fry bread before, got a chocolate and butter covered one. 

Someone was a bit liberal with the spices this trip as the green chile beef and chorizo were a lot hotter than usual, but that's how you know it's homemade. 

This place is one of the many Phoenix eateries near and dear to my heart."}
{"text":"I was on a solo trip to Arizona and I wanted to make sure i stopped to try local food ...or actually real Native American Food... The Fry Bread House was my first spot I went to, to try the culture out!...  The food has some SPICE to it for sure!! What i Had was SPICY but it was good...The bread is made to order and tasty.. Im not sure what I would recommend there because I have not tried many of the items...but the flatbread is pretty good :)"}
{"text":"Love the location and interior setting. I ordered the Fry Bread with shredded beef and it was fantastic! I couldn't finish my food because the serving was huge. Only reason i didn't give 5 Stars because of the service. I walked in and didn't know to order or if waiter would take my order. Staff walked by like i was invisible. I finally figured it out in others came inside and stood in line. I saw a huge party walk in and they were confused like me. I politely showed them where to order. Overall the food was delicious, prepared fast and a huge amount of food."}
{"text":"Deep fried pockets of deliciousness.... Even better when served with green chile pork, chorizo, or as the Ultimate taco.  It gets crowded around lunchtime, so take out is a good option."}
{"text":"Giving two stars for the benefit of the doubt. Stopped by to try the fry bread which I had heard was a must try. We went in, looked at the menu and decided we were going to get takeout. Stood at the counter, a woman was cleaning some equipment, she saw us, never said a thing. Not a 'someone will be with you', 'hold on let me get someone', nothing Just kept cleaning, gave it a few more minutes and then we left, figured they didn't need our business."}
{"text":"Ultimate taco with green chile beef was amazing!!! Posole was underwhelming at best though. Portion was HUGE! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice atmosphere. Base pricing was very reasonable for the large portions. Beware of add-ons though! $1.25 for lettuce or jalapeño seems kind of insane to me."}
{"text":"I love Fry Bread!!  But my big belly doesn't let me indulge as much as I would like!!  Occasionally when I get the hankering, this is the place!!

I really enjoy their chile toppings, either red or green with all the fixins!  Just really good traditional food made by authentically traditional ladies in the back!   Yes, ladies you rock!!!"}
{"text":"I crave fry bread and grew up in the Midwest with it    These hit the spot.   First of all huuuuge !!!  I had one with beans meat and all the fixings and one with honey.   So delicious !!"}
{"text":"We flew into Phoenix and just had time for lunch on the way to Sedona and the Grand Canyon. We had researched The Fry Bread House and wanted to give fry bread tacos a try. SO glad we did.

Never had it before, but these were better than the fry bread we had in a cafe on the Navajo Nation, so I have to assume they're authentic.

It's a small place and a little difficult to find, but clean, cool, with a friendly staff. And fry bread tacos are amazing.

We both loved the Ultimate Taco. If you like chewy, fried flatbread, you haven't lived until you've had a taco made on it. Go a little out of your way (not far from the airport and Interstate 17) and enjoy a southwestern treat."}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing!!! I am so happy that I don't have to attend the State Fair to get my fill of fry bread and theirs it top notch! We normally get take out and everything is so delicious and the portions are huge we eat it for several meals. It's in a great location right down the street from our house. Dear Fry Bread House keep doing what you're doing because it's perfect! Don't miss out on the Hatch Chile!"}
{"text":"Very very yummy!!!!!! Never disappoints! Green chili taco and honey powder sugar is bomb"}
{"text":"I concur! This place is DEE-LISH! 

I had the beef stew and fry bread, and my friend had the vegetarian taco. Her taco was HUGE! Bigger than her head! She couldn't finish it. I think it could easily feed two people. 

The ice tea has free refills. Hells to the yes! 

Next time I will split a taco with my husband so I have room to try their desserts. mmmm....cinnamon and sugar fry bread. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Oh man, talk about guilty pleasure. It's basically SNL's \"Taco Town\" in real life, if you know that reference.

Even the dessert fry breads are good. And loaded."}
{"text":"Came in near closing time - so near that the lady at the register looked back at the clock and told us our order would be made to go (because they were already cleaning the dining room). I asked if she thought I needed to order one or two of the \"Indian Tacos\" because this was my first time there and I wasn't sure how big they were. She told me I only needed one, and she was right! They're huge!! I got the deluxe and we sat in chairs outside while ate - there are no tables outside, only a few chairs. We finished eating before the last dining room customers finished eating and throughly cleaned up after ourselves so I didn't feel guilty eating curb side."}
{"text":"When your friend who makes fry bread, vouches for this place and says it's the real deal, you go down there and check this place out.  And that's exactly what I did.  It is mosy definitely good, greasy, junk food.  In oh so glorious fry bread.  Some of their items are a little pricey, the honey and sugar fry bread, for one, but it sounds and tastes so good, you suck it up and order it anyway.  The flavors are overflowing, both figuratively and literally as the tacos mostly fall apart the second you try to pick it up.  They do provide a fork and knife to help with this, but don't do that, use your fry bread and scoop everything right up even if it makes your taco fall apart again.  My only little gripe is that although I taste the meat, the texture of it reminds me of refried beans.  Still good, nonetheless, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I forgot to review this place when I was on vacation in AZ. It's one of those corner restaurants that you ask your friend if they \"want to try this place?\" The portions are insanely huge.. I couldn't even finish my plate and on top of my meal, my brother ordered us a fry bread dessert with honey and powdered sugar on top! Can you say FOOD COMA!? It was delish!"}
{"text":"Here is the paradox of the Fry Bread House. You want to eat your fry bread while it's sizzling hot and freshly puffed, at which point it is light, airy, and gently crisp -- a superlative fry bread that leaves many other fry breads deflated with shame at not measuring up to its texture. At the same time, eating in is likely to harsh your buzz, as the restaurant has the eerie dive-iness of a place that's kept scrupulously clean but that's too big to be properly lit and decorated on the available budget.

My suggestion would be to stop by before a show at the nearby Rhythm Room, get your fry bread \"to go,\" hustle back to the venue at top speed, and eat your piping hot fry bread on the picnic tables before the doors open. 

I ordered mine with beans and cheese, and these are fine beans. Now I'm torn between wanting another savory round with many things heaped on it (bring on the chorizo!) and wanting to try 'em with sweet toppings."}
{"text":"My 1st time her and I must say it was absolutely amazing. The Indian taco was to die for. I can see how addictive it can be. I had the ultimate and omg I will definitely be back very soon. I see why people rave about this place. The owner is a sweet native American that too over operation from her parents. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. They have all kinds of food. Indian tacos, tamales, menudo, burgers and much more"}
{"text":"While the white man still struggles with getting the native population to die so Uncle Sam can take over the casinos and cigarette sales, the tribes smile and continue to wave their tribal lawyers at the government but there is a secret plot to kill the white man and it's plain delicious!

Yes, if you don't notice from the size of the workers and other tribe members who eat there or sell jewelry out front, fry bread is not a diet item. Seldom is the mana from heaven good for you but why question the powers that be?

Start with the chili (red's my favorite) and fry bread and finish off with the butter and chocolate fry bread. A quick trip to the emergency ward for some artery cleaning and you are ready to go back for more.

Seriously, one of the better fry bread places and it's clean, inexpensive and the staff is friendly. You will need to wash your hands after your meal or your car keys will slide from your hands and forget trying to steer. With such a small parking lot, one does not want to navigate out of a spot with greasy hands.

*I had to laugh at the Yelp form when it asked about \"reservations.\" ;)"}
{"text":"yum yum yum yum yum. Been wanting to try this place after trying a fry bread taco at Oktoberfest. Took my daughter there today. Got a beef chili taco and chorizo taco to go. Had to resist licking the plate. Awesome food fast service."}
{"text":"Had been reading reviews about the Fry Bread House and had been looking forward to eating here. It's a very cute restaurant, very casual. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Menu is up on a board when you walk in. You order at the register and they give you a number and they bring  your food to your table.
My husband and I both had the fry bread. I had the beans and red chile and my husband had the fry bread with  green chile only. The fry bread was very doughy, making it extremely difficult to pick up and eat. The beans in mine were very bland as was the red chile. They don't give you much chile either. I tasted my husbands green chile and it was very spicy. I love spicey food but that was a little too much for me. He also said it was good but felt it had very little green chile in it. Next time  if we go he wants to get the green chile stew, with the fry bread on the side. It would be much easier to eat and you probably would get more chile.
We got 2 fry breads to go but wouldn't do that again. Just not the same when you re-heat them.
All in all it was ok but was expecting more after reading all the hype about it."}
{"text":"Food is on point. Had a green chile taco and a sweet fry bread. The restaurant is a little run down, but the food certainly makes up for it."}
{"text":"Frybread is sooo good that it makes me feel very bad.  I know it's not going to be good for me but I do it anyway.  

Do it.  Do that cramped dive-y space called the Frybread House.  When you're feeling very bad.

Afterward go to confession."}
{"text":"Amazing fry bread topped with ground beef was truly delicious! Make sure to have time to eat there, the bottom of the fry bread got soggy on the way home (15 minutes away)

Cashier was really nice and helpful with he menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Actually very good.  The fry bread was pillowy and tasty. The green chile was delicious and spicy. Hot sauce ok. Cool modern decor with ropes and cacti. Nice people. 

It didn't taste greasy. Hey I know it was fried, but it tasted fresh and good. I will come back and try red chile."}
{"text":"Mmmm Indian Fry Bread. Is it a cake, bread, pastry or other delicious baked good? Is it for breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert? Its all of these things!

So far I've only tried this mysterious disk in its sweet dessert form. What could make deep fried bread even better? Well covering it in chocolate would be a good start. If that's not enough lets add some melted butter to it. Holy doctors worst nightmare!

Despite knowing what it was I was doing to myself I was still able to enjoy this delicious treat. The butter and the chocolate was a great combination. Its all tied together with the chewy warm dough that's been fried to perfection. 

This was so rich even in a sugar binge eat everything in site kind of night I had to stop after half.

I wouldn't recommend this more than once or twice a year for your own sake. Bring a friend and share the MmmMMmmm"}
{"text":"Food is great! The only reason I only give 4 stars is because the place is really dirty, the staff is super rude,  and you have to put your own dishes away. There is also no place to sit and the wait time is horrible. Their set up is really weird. They are stingy with their drinks. But... the food is great. Everything I have tried is fantastic."}
{"text":"Very tasty, but dont go.  Seating is limited and I dont want you taking me seat."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about fry bread house for awhile now. So when I moved into my new home and found it right next door to my neighborhood dive bar, which does not serve food, I was understandably excited.  
You know what you need whilst drinking cheap beer? greasy food.  This isn't greasy bad, like dripping and wet, this is good.  This is fluffy warm fry bread, with delicious spicy chorrizo, and all the fixings.
The prices are good, the staff was friendly and quick, and the food? oh yes, I  will be back.
Also, the leftovers with a fried egg cracked on top, a great breakfast the next morning.  really."}
{"text":"After a lifetime of California 'fair food' masquerading as fry-bread, this was a delight!
Light and fluffy. Fresh and hot and not at all greasy. We all loved it, including a 13 year old and somewhat picky 9 year old. All of the following can be recommended:

- Ultimate taco with red chile beef
- Spicy pisole
- Bean and cheese fry bread
- the cheese covered fry bread

The physical restaurant is sub-par, but a sign said they will be moving soon."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! This place is absolutely amazing!! Don't let the appearance fool you... The food and the service are top-notch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great fry bread and toppings, large portions, decent prices, friendly staff. Highly recommended for a quick, filling lunch!"}
{"text":"Respect the Fry Bread house and the native culture.  A small place located on the west side of 7th St. and Indian School Rd, in Central Phoenix.  This corner is a strong developing area in Phoenix along with 7th St in general.  This is a popular Phoenix lunch and dinner restaurant.  Its places like this that reflects the word of mouth when there's good food.  Allow your palate choose the right Fry Bread, from vegi to meat lovers.  Did i mention their freaking huge. Don't for get your appetite."}
{"text":"Much improvements since my last visit 3 yrs ago. From 2 stars up to 4 stars. The stews (hominy & beef stew) were much hotter, however they were on the salty side. I've also tried their green chili shredded beef taco which were excellent & I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was at Showcase Honda getting my car fixed and remembered that the Fry Bread House is only a mile away. What an excuse to try this place. I set my expectations low on the place because all the reviews told me it's not the interior but the food. So driving there I noticed it's really sketchy area of town. The outside of the building isn't maintained and neither is the plants or the parking lot but I really wanted to try this place so what the heck. 

I walk in and all I see is a bunch of tables surrounding the place then in the very back I happened to see the counter. Very unusual to be so far back but what the heck. 

Everyone told me the menu is in the wall so I walk up to the counter looking for the menu but the menu is to the right of the counter. All the reviews told me Red Chili taco. Had that in mind and that's what I ordered. I got the choice of retried beans or meat and of course I got the meat. They give you a number and you find your own table. 

Anyways, I found my table and before I know it BOOM. I'm served. Very cool. Let me just tell you first and foremost. It's so dang good. The fry bread is so soft, fresh, and light. The red chili is out of the world. So good. Has a nice little kick to it. If you like it hotter, they bring out home made hot sauce with your meal. I tried eating it like a normal taco but wasn't successful. It's so messy but so good. I really did enjoy it. 

The lady at the counter was so nice and friendly. The person who brought out my food and even the busboy were so friendly.

Like everyone said this is a true blue dive. Dining area is ok but the food is great. Don't come here for the ambiance or atmosphere cause there is none but come here for the food and nice service. I was very surprised by this place and for sure will be back."}
{"text":"Was passing through Phoenix on way to the airport.  Realizing I had extra time, I stopped here to try fry bread which I had never had.  This was one of the awesomest things I have ever tried. I had the bean and cheese fry bread. The fry bread was delicious, fresh and not at all greasy. The beans were really delicious and elevated this to great! They were fresh and not overly seasoned - just perfect. I only wish I had been hungry enough to try the dessert offerings. The restaurant is cute, the people were lovely and I would recommend a stop here to anyone."}
{"text":"Fry bread is amazing.  We all know that and this place does not fail to deliver fantastic fry bread.  I had the ultimate green chili fried taco and it is as good as it sounds.  The place is very small but we had no problem finding seating around lunch time.  The price was a bit expensive.  For a ultimate fry bread taco and a med drink was just over $10.  Chips and salsa are $3.75 so I had to pass on those.  Otherwise this is a great place to bring some co workers and chow down on some lunch and dessert fry bread."}
{"text":"The red chile is unbelievable. The only gripe is that the Phoenix location is a tad small."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here some stupid policy they have about returning my food that was wrongly order! They could've just change the soup That simply order but nope they go blabbering about their so called \"policy!\""}
{"text":"I went here for years and thoroughly enjoyed it but havent been in the area for a few years and popped in today.  I'll unfortunately say it wasn't what I remembered.  The red chili taco didnt have much in it like before.  The cinnamon sugar fry bread when I got it home saw they gave me a powdered sugar one instead.   The side order of red Chile stew was all red chili and onions, hardly a few bites of beef.  I'd taken my boyfriend excited to introduce him and he didn't finish more than a quarter of his taco.   The staff wasn't friendly anymore either.  
I am really bummed...  I'd had high hopes to have their excellent meals again and it was just so-so."}
{"text":"The fry bread here is delicious. Above all lots of flavor and top notch customer service.

I got the special beef and potato burro that was pleasantly pleasing.

The decor needs a lot of work but otherwise very good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The red chili is always tasty and very delicious. Today (01/20/17), I just tried the green chili combination taco and it was also very flavorful. More spicy than the red chili but still most excellent. Their prices did increase a little but definitely worth it still. The fry bread is authentic, and fluffy just like my grandmother used to make. Never can go wrong with this place, highly recommend it for lunch or dinner. Serving sizes are nice and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My buddy Kevin N. back in San Jose told me about the Fry Bread House. He said I had to find it and try it when i got to Phoenix.  It sounded like a place I would LOVE.  So when I got here I started looking to see if I could find it.  I drove down Indian School on several occasions, turned down 7th St.....nothin.  After several attempts and a post to Yelpers I realized that I was looking for 7th AVE and not 7th ST.  Doh!!  With that issue out of the way, I made a trip over last week and found it!!  

The parking lot of pretty full.....good sign in my book, and it looked like a little house on the outside.  We walked in and picked up a menu.  I wanted to try it all but I finally narrowed it down and ordered the Hominy Stew.  My daughter had some fry bread with cheese.  We were greated warmly, ordered, got our drinks and sat down to wait.  We did not wait long for our food and out came the fry bread and the stew.  My daughter LOVED her fry bread with cheese.  That is her kind of thing.  The hominy stew was perfection!!  I love hominy and there were chunks of tender beef in a nice broth.  And a giant piece of fry bread to go with it.  I was so full when I left.  I totallly loved it.  

This is a great place!!  A nice little hole in the wall that serves up big portions for small prices.  You can see the ladies in the back cooking up  a storm!  This is such a little gem of a place.  I only wish that they could take all the calories and bad things out of the fry bread....but then it wouldn't be fry bread and it wouldn't be nearly as good.  *sigh*  I can't wait to go back and try the tacos, the green and red chile, or any of the other amazing sounding things they have on the menu!!  Seriously, get to the Fry Bread house now and enjoy!!  

Special thanks to Kevin N. for telling me about this wonderful little gem!!
Miss you Kevin!!"}
{"text":"This is a 1 star at best.  The fry bread was soggy and it tasted as if it was fried in fish grease or really old grease.  The salsa was absolutely disgusting. The taste of the grease lingered on my pallet for hours.  

Additionally, the customer service was horrible. The order taker was rude.   This was our first time at this establishment and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered tacos with only meat and cheese, they bring us our order wrong, I spoke to the manager and she had the nerve to ask me if we ordered the tacos right. Two people told us that our order was being remade, waited over 30 minutes. Had to speak to the manager to be remade, and had to wait even longer. I was terribly disappointed-
Usually they do a good job. Their customer service was terrible. *Update- they brought out the \"tacos\" in little cups of meat and cheese with corn tortillas and told us to make them ourselves. I asked for a refund and they stated that they do not give refunds. I asked the manager  how she could treat customers that way? And her reply \"we aren't treating you any way\" and she was rude to us. They didn't refund us, yelled at us, told us that they had us ordering on tape and she wouldn't show us the tape. I was upset that she wouldn't refund us, and that she brought out meat and cheese and tortillas- I dumped the tray over and walked out. She tells the story on Facebook that I had a rampage...it seems like she has encountered unsatisfied customers before."}
{"text":"It was not that great it was over priced I got a green chili fry bread there was barly any meat in the chili the beans needed salt the red salsa had no flavor honestly the only thing I liked was the green salsa"}
{"text":"The Fry Bread House is fantastic- not healthy by any means, but delicious all the same.  The menu is short, but filled with both meal fry breads and dessert.  
I had beans, cheese and tomatoes on mine and then split one of the powdered sugar breads for dessert with my friend. Both were excellent. 
The restaurant itself is supercasual- you order at the counter and sit at little tables.  The food is very reasonable and the staff is friendly. 
Definitely not a restaurant to miss!"}
{"text":"3 stars for nostalgia.  I left feeling disappointed.  The frybread was thin, the bean & cheese didn't runneth over , was more of a smear & the red chili had zero heat.  A little history, this restaurant has been an urban native staple for years.  It has changed location a few times.  The newest location is sized well,  not tiny like the first restaurant and not so huge like the old Panchos location.   I used to break a mild sweat with the red chili and the frybread was fluffy.  The menu options have increased,  there are tamales,  chumuth (Pima tortillas), dessert frybreads, $10! Frybread burgers and stews.  Might be nice to see the food go back to basics.  In a nutshell, I felt it was a bit over priced.  
Good to see Native Artwork is still supported."}
{"text":"If there was a Zero star that's what this place would have gotten overly priced for just ground beef and the fry bread alone $6.50 no cheese,lettuce etc. They must don't know their competition here in Phoenix like White Eyes FryBread where you get any topping added to your choice of meat for $6. The cinammon honey sugar FryBread was bland! Was in booth less than 3 mins after receiving food... Starving still and disappointed! Don't trust other reviews I did coming from N.Phoenix"}
{"text":"The fry bread melts in your mouth! Delicious Indian Tacos. Glad i had the chance to visit this location before you move to 7th /Hazelwood"}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch here with some friends on a sunny weekend. Among our group, we got: beef+vegetable stew w/ fry bead; a green taco; a red taco; a veggie taco.

I had the green taco. The bread itself was good; the stewed beef was so-so. It wasn't spectacularly, and it also didn't taste like much. My friend, who got a red taco, said she could make better fry bread at home. She was very not impressed.

The portions were huge; nobody finished their meal."}
{"text":"Decent food, but as other reviews have stated, poor service. 

My mom likes this place. She was born in raised in Phoenix and always comes here. I was along for the ride so I came in with an open mind. I ordered the vegetable beef stew special. It was pretty good, but I had never had fry bread before so I didn't have any expectations. 

My biggest complaint would be that we asked for the desserts to go, and we had to go chase down the waitress and have her to bring them to us after we had finished eating our lunches. When they finally did come, they were made to eat at the restaurant so I had to ask the waitress again to have them packaged to go. I am guessing they made a fresh batch to go because it took a while. 

The food was good but not to die for. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. And the interior of the place needs work. For a place that supposedly just moved into this location, it sure had a lot of broken tables and out of order bathrooms."}
{"text":"One good thing about large chains is they make you really appreaciate a place like this.  
Small, rustic and no one ramming apps or desserts down your gullet. 
A James Beard award winner for local fare, The Fry Bread House is great!  Big taco like creations with their amazing fry bread. The green chili sauce is outstanding.
You also need to make room in your belly for their dessert. It's chocolate sauce on their fry bread. Amazingly simple and extremely addictive. My hands looked like a fight scene from The Matrix as to how fast I ate it! 
Parking lot is super tiny and I heard the lunch crowd is huge (not large in weight just lots of people)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Joedd Special w Beef Stew. My beef stew turned out to be a veggie stew w 2 pieces of beef. I asked for more beef or to get it re-poured but i was told 'thats how it comes'. So i asked if they could just re-pour it, and was rudely told 'do you want a to go container'. Seriously? How Rude! Dont waste your $ coming here. I paid $18 too much for 2 veggie stews w frybread."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for fry bread. I've grown up with this food so it's not so much a novelty as a long time staple of this a native Arizonan's diet. It conjures up memories of taking out of towners to Canyon de Chelly to see Spider Rock, volunteering as a Girl Scout at the fry bread stand (all you can eat pillowy goodness!) and eating a \"Navajo taco\" with all the fixins right before hopping on the Zipper at the State fair. 

Disclaimer: Erica does not endorse the consumption of fry bread before having the contents of your stomach whirred about in a frenzy of nausea inducing quasi-whip lash. Just ain't a good idea.

I pretty much stalk craft fairs with visions of deep fried crispiness topped with meaty, cheesy, beany, sweet and crunchity mmmmmm *drool*. Little did I know that full time fry bread heaven was less than ten minutes away!

The menu is simple, an indication that everything on there is done to perfection, especially the green chile, which was a-bangin' when I went. A couple of menus are right next to the register, so wait patiently for someone to pass one back to you if you're in line, or step up and snag one. You give your order to the lady at the register and it's fired back to the kitchen where it's assembled lightning fast and ready for pick up. Hot sauce is on the table and your silverware are beneath your taco (took me a minute to realize that) so take a seat and chow down!

There are the traditional tacos that consist of heavenly fried goodness topped with beans, red or green chile and garnish (cheese and lettuce), as well as dessert fry bread drizzled in honey or sprinkled with powdered sugar-- but you'll be much to full by the end of your meal to indulge unless you're sharing with a group. There are several stews (hominy, red and green chile) that come with a piece of fry bread for dipping and making lil sammiches. Or you can go the burrito route if the siren call of the fryer doesn't tempt you.

Don't forget to check out the jewelery out front. A gent with some turquoise and silver wares is usually there if you're looking to support some local jewelers after your nirvana inducing lunch.

This place is just as good as anything I've encountered on the Res, and ten times better than fair food. 

And that my friends is a recommendation as glowing as the lovely sheen of oil topping your taco."}
{"text":"The food was good but the customer service was absolutely AWFUL. I won't be returning again. There's many other fry bread houses that cater to customers"}
{"text":"Awwww yeah. Do you find yourself low on sodium? Do you want more grease than the ADA nutritional guidelines recommends? But do you want your face to explode with flavor rainbows? You should try The Fry Bread House.

We visited there and their sparsely-furnished dining hall was in transition. We overheard they're moving so I can understand. But let's be honest: you're not here for the decor or for a fully-paved parking lot. You want el sabor supremo.

I got the ground beef taco, hubby got the chorizo. Oh wow. So much punch. So salty. So delicious. This is the kind of meal you are sad that bits of cheese and meat are still stuck to the serving paper under the taco and you want to eat them but are afraid of also consuming paper fibers. But you do it anyways because YOLO.

Times visited: 1"}
{"text":"Loved the read chili combination taco, full of flavor and is not spicy at all. The bread was flaky, and crunchy, yet beautifully made. I Also got the frybread sweets with just honey, it was absolutely delicious. Will definitely be coming to this cute little spot in the future. The staff was friendly and had a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"Moving finally to the last of my supplementary snacks I'll start off by saying I'd read about The Fry Bread House a couple of times when planning my trip to The Valley but it did not make my list of must visit stops until just the day prior during dinner at Kai when I was speaking with head Chef Michael O'Dowd about the lack of Native American restaurants in the area (he explained this to me, but that is for another time) and one of his expeditors suggested I should check out Cecilia Miller's temple of fried dough calling it \"about as authentic as it gets around here.\"

Hailing from the Tohono O'odham Nation and serving up her style of Indian Tacos around the area for nearly twenty years (and now at two locations) I opted to head to the original Fry Bread House West and having followed my GPS from door to door I found the location with ease on a relatively dingy stretch of 7th Avenue and allocating parking with ease I made my way into the unassuming low-lying restaurant where I was greeted by a short line and then by a curt but friendly waitress who took no time in requesting my order and name before handing me a plastic cup to get my water and suggesting it would be perhaps 10 minutes before my food was ready.

Taking a seat - the table slightly sticky and clearly not wiped down since (at least) the last diners - and browsing the scene while I watched the kitchen work through the small open window I marveled at the flow of the room as patron after patron received his or her food.  With some orders having been phoned in and others being delivered to the tables surrounding mine if I had to guess nearly fifteen Fry Breads were served during my nine minute wait and when I finally heard \"Michael\" called from the front I stepped up to collect my $12 merely seconds before the next order was served up to \"Andre.\"

Returning to my seat with prizes in hand my first impression was that I'd over ordered as each disc was easily the size of a Frisbee and two-to-three fold as thick, but picking up my first option, the \"Indian Taco with Pinto Beans, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce\" I was next impressed as to just how light the hand stretched bread was - a wisp of pillowy flat bread crisped on the outside by the oil but light and airy within.  With the ingredients a standard store-bought admixture of traditional taco toppings and a bit of hot sauce to taste this was a good choice to understand what the \"Indian Taco\" was all about (and perhaps to understand why diabetes and lipid disorders are so prevalent in their population, as well.)

Moving next to my dessert selection, one of the frequently noted \"best dishes\" in Phoenix and denoted as an \"Award Winning Favorite\" on the restaurant menu, the Chocolate and Butter Fry Bread would prove to be every bit the \"Fair Food\" extravagance I expected with the same airy dough this time served openfaced and drizzled - nay - ladled first with butter and then with melted dark chocolate tinged with what I believe was adobe spice and cinnamon.  Sliced and resting atop both wax paper and napkins to soak up the grease I attacked this fry bread with zeal and without going so far as to call it the most sinful thing I've eaten this year I will simply say this; it was a once-in-a-year sort of treat that was entirely worth the money, calories, and visit but at the same time the sort of thing that simply feels \"bad\" for you despite the smile on your face as you're eating it."}
{"text":"This was unique and tasted really good, we got the veggie taco, chocolate dessert both were amazing! Super unhealthy but tasted good! My husband got the green chile beef taco, again very good like nothing we had before!"}
{"text":"Hey there people....I have one thing to say.

Go. To. The Fry Bread House.   So naughty, so yummy."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I'm not giving it 5-stars. I love this place! The red chili with fry bread is incredible. For about 4 or 5 visits, I wouldn't order anything else (didn't want to take the chance of something/anything not being as tasty) but the server recommended the red chili taco and damn was it good too! 

We usually hit this place for lunch 2-3 times a month, if not more."}
{"text":"Do you know what fire tastes like?  I do,  the green chili burrito!  It was amazing,  the taste I crave.  It burns so goooooood!  Also tried a vegetarian tamale,  mmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"You know, every culture has some delicious form of fried bread. From donuts to funnel cakes to begniets to fried dough to sopapillas and on and on. 
They are all good. Deep fried, melt-in-your-mouth, good.

Indian Fry bread is no exception. It may have the advantage of being easier to make at home than other fried doughs... so I am a big fan.

Here I had the vegetarian and it was filled with a tasty mess of green chiles and beans and other mostly healthy things. 

Then I had the eyes-roll-back-in-your-head honey and sugar combo. Hot and tasty honey. Beautiful bread and powdered sugar. Just a pleasure to eat.

The staff here was very nice, too."}
{"text":"Big fan of Fry Bread House. I love the hominy beef stew with the fry bread. The fry bread is just flat out amazing. That stew is so good I usually burn my tongue with inadequate waiting.

I've had the tacos & they're good but tough to make me pass on the stew.

The dessert fry bread (gotta go honey w/powdered sugar) is also amazing.

Cheap & locally owned too. Gotta love that.

One of the AZ musts for folks visiting from elsewhere in my book."}
{"text":"This was first time trying out American Indian food and I can't say I was all that impressed.

First I went with this stew called Menudo (red) -- yeah, definitely not a fan of the overload in hominy. I mean, this stew could possibly be amazing for those hominy lovers, but it's not for me. The taste and texture was not very appealing to me.

I then decided to try out their famous fry bread tacos. Fry bread I guess i would have to describe as a better tasting chalupa. Anyways, I didnt know which to choose from the menu so i thought that it was best that i try multiple ones since i might not ever get a chance to return to this area. The two I went with were the Chili Combination Taco (green) and the Chorizo Combo taco. Both were decent tasting, but it was so greasy that I feel like I will now be dieting for the rest of my life to burn off these calories. Although not my favorite of meals, it was worth trying out at least once."}
{"text":"My new spot for green chili stew... 5.99 for a bowl of the best, most perfectly spiced hatch beef green chili! Fry bread adds 2.00 to the bill. Very friendly counter service. A small store off to the side with artisans and their work while you wait delivery of your food. My partner in crime ordered the cheesy fry bread.. It was excellent. I will b back for more taste testing in the near future! Thanks for being here!! Don't let the parking lot fool you--the good stuff awaits you on the inside."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here after reading everyone's reviews. However the food and service were very disappointing . The fry bread was cold and greasy and there was hardly anything inside. The green chile might have been good had there been enough there to actually taste.  we asked for extra hot sauce (you get a little 1 oz cup with your taco but that's not enough) and the gal at the counter told us she was too busy, yet when my friend needed a box for leftovers she just yelled over her shoulder for someone to give us a box. Why couldn't she do that when we needed more hot sauce? Would NEVER eat here again even if the food was better. Their treatment of us told us they dont need our business.  If you are not from around here and have never eaten fried bread dough with mexican fixings on it, you might enjoy it!"}
{"text":"What a dive! I had their fry bread taco w chorizo ground beef.  FREAKING AWESOME. the bread was delicious and fluffy.  The meat was spicy and flavorful.  The taco was huge but I scarfed it.  I'll be back at least one more time before I leave A zilla."}
{"text":"\"I like it so much I'd like to eat here everyday for forever.\" That was the comment from a four year old when I last ate at the former location of The Fry Bread House. Fortunately, the food remains as good as ever, not harmed at all when the capacity to serve customers expanded.

A great place for visitors to Arizona who want to sample some genuinely regional cuisine, specifically derived from the traditions of the Tohono O'odham. The Native American craft booths are a fun bonus. 

Just don't expect much in the way of ambience. You can sense that the building was once a cheap Mexican food cafeteria. Oh well. Just convince yourself it adds to the charm of the establishment.

I must admit that I do miss the sketchy and cramped confines of the old location, but having a little extra room to dine is nice. It must also be great for the Native American craft vendors to have space inside in air conditioning.

The staff has always been friendly to us. I read some reviews on Yelp that complained of inattentive service... Surprising to me. I'm suspicious that some of those negative comments may be the result of cultural miscommunications. We weren't really greeted when we entered on our most recent visit, but the server who brought our food to the table was very engaging and we were warmly sent on our way as we exited. I'd characterize it as a kind of quiet friendliness that you might miss if you aren't accustomed to it.

Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"For real.. place was boo boo. My native friend hyped this shit up, and brought me a supreme damn indian taco. That muddafunka was weak sauce. Not much flavor in the red chili. Beans were meh.. Cheese... Lettuce. Sour cream. Overall plain as fugg.. 

I decided to give them another try, cuz I was craving some damn menudo, and no place has menudo during the week. Me and my coworker Fernando hit up the FBH at 11am. I ordered menudo.. Fernie was in line right behind me bout ta order when some fine thang who reminded me of a Brown Stallion Horse with skates on came up and told the clerk, \"skuse me..deyyzz supposed ta be sep-rit oah-duz.\"

the clerk looked at her like she was a terrorist, and let out a super long, loud, and frustrated, \"Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!­\"

The shit was disrespectful as hell.

Whatever.. I sat down and waited for my menudo. You figure it should probably take 5 minutes or less to take a laddle.. dip the muthafunka in a big ass pot of pre-made soup.. pour it into a styrofoam container.. put a lid on it.. put it in a brown bag.. toss a pre-made baggie of onion and cilantro in.. grab a piece of fry bread form the muthafunka crankin out frybread.. toss that shit in the bag.. and shout out a nigga name.

Nah man. Their shitty ass process took 30 fuckin minutes!!! Then I took that shit out of the bag! \"WTF is this???\" I said. FBH hooked up a midget ass little cup of menudo, and some fried dough for 7 bucks. My other spot does like 3 times that for less money! Stingy ass FBH.. You guys can suck one. That ish didn't even taste good. Work on your broth mane, and throw some damn limes in the bag. Eff this place man. Don't go here-"}
{"text":"Ordered the Red chile taco. Wife got Red Chili stew and a Cinnamon and Sugar fry bread delicious. I will be back again soon"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in on a rainy Wednesday for lunch between Christmas and New Year.  
This place definitely busier than Sacred Hogan and I can say I enjoy this place almost as much.  I find that their fry bread here is thicker and crispier than that of Sacred Hogan and they salt their food well (to the point I didn't have to add any, and I think I have a salty palate). Sacred Hogan is not as generous with their salt (can be good and bad).  
My mom had the beef stew and I had the combo indian taco with red chile.  I can say that I would go back just for a bowl of their red chile beef,  and has me curious about their green chile, after having it on my taco (this coming from a Native New Mexico girl who knows her chile) .  It was not spicy but full of flavor.  My mom's beef stew was hearty and served with a good sized piece of fry bread and was quite tasty.  
We left stuffed and didn't eat another meal that day.  

I will still find myself going to Sacred Hogan for their Lamb Sandwich, or their Mutton Stew but you may find me mixing in a little FBH now and again."}
{"text":"My first stop in Phoenix was the Fry Bread House and I instantly started a fry bread addiction for the rest of my stay. The surroundings are nothing fancy and the food comes out in disposable containers, but its delicious and extremely cheap. I particularly recommend the green chile stew that comes with a side of fry bread."}
{"text":"my family went to az for vacation and found reviews for this place on yelp. coming from CA, i've never had the luxury of trying fry bread. it's very similar to the asian indian prathara, but it seems a bit more greasy...but don't get me wrong, still very good.  we had the red chili ultimate taco - it was HUGE!  

The best was chocolate and butter fry bread - clogged arteries here we come (butter on top of something deep fried ...eeks).  definitely get this one to share.  my only regret is that i didnt try the honey fry bread."}
{"text":"Been there several times, sun tea and tacos is the usual order. It's a fun place. The hardest part is deciding whether you want dinner or dessert. Both is best left for competitive eaters. It's casual but mostly clean and they sell mucho frybread. The salsas were all great. I'm obviously a tourist here but it's clear that the passion for fry bread is similar to pizza, bagels or any other regional carb based favorite. Except it's fried, so kudos to you guys for taking it to the next level.  Some people eat it plain too. Fry bread done correctly is a must-experience for any visitor to the American Southwest. For those unfamiliar but want to know more, there's a wierd mockumentary \"more than frybread\" not necessarily about this restaurant but about the general concept."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The food was average and i could have definitely made it at home. Maybe if they varied their tacos ingredients i could see how the price would be justifiable,  unfortunately it was rather plain."}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of my fry bread taco, it looked and tasted delicious! The restaurant is not much to look at from the outside and the inside is very plain. We didn't dine in so I didn't get a good luck at the set up.  The cashier is also the person who takes the order and she was very helpful and friendly, since it had been my first visit there.  I knew I wanted cheese and beans, but I also added the ground beef. The food was hot, the fry bread was light, and fluffy.  The beans, cheese and beef were seasoned just right, it melted in my mouth.  Even though the portion is large, I wanted more. My brother ordered the green chili and that would be my only regret.  I will be back for the green chili, it has a nice little kick to it and is amazing.  I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"***update***  12/31/17
Since my last review, The Fry Bread House moved from the location on about 14th ST and Indian School to it's current location on 7th Ave, just south of Camelback, which is literally a few blocks from its original 7th Ave location, that is currently PHX Burrito House.  Still has the same great food & owners, but this newest location is about half the size as its immediate predecessor location.  I spoke with the owner once, and she stated they moved from the Indian School location because the building was old and needed a lot of work.  This newest location is about as large as the original 7th AVE location, with slightly better parking.  

Previous Review 10/13/2014
This is my favorite place for fry bread, and IMHO the best place you can go to get some.  I've been coming here since they we e at the location near 7th AVE and Indian School, and this spot is INFINITELY better.  Not the old location was bad, they just outgrew it.  This new location used to be a couple of different Mexican Food locations, most recently a Pancho's I believe, and was a Maya's before that, I think.  In any event, same great food, but a ton more parking and restaurant space

My favorites are the ultimate taco,  green chili stew with a fry bread, and hominy stew with a fry bread."}
{"text":"Took my in laws from North Carolina here and they absolutely loved it! SCORE! They had never had fried bread before and I made sure they had authentic. Nothing else will ever compare so they will just have to keep coming back for them delicious Indian tacos!"}
{"text":"There are hardly words to describe the deliciousness of this restaurant. 

I have heard about the Fry Bread House, as most of us probably have, because this little local restaurant has won a James Beard award which is.... odd. Usually the words 'James Beard' evoke imagery of white tablecloths, waiters with the contraptions to clean crumbs from the table, ridiculous numbers of forks for various purposes..... well, this isn't that place (at all). This restaurant is (temporarily) located in the old Pancho's buffet, which, as you know, was a very classy establishment (heh). They did pretty much nothing to make the space their own.... The buffet area is sectioned off with a sheet hanging from the ceiling, some of the extra rooms house other businesses (Native American art anyone?), and the floors/walls/tiles/etc are all the same. This is understandable as they have announced that they are moving (again) to 7th ave and Camelback (ish) early next year. 

Anyway.... the husband and I came here with the International Supper Club on Wednesday night. The clientele was eclectic to say the least, but that is part of the charm. They have the menu posted on the wall, you order at the counter, and they deliver your food to the table. We had the cheese crisp, the green chili combo taco, and the butter and chocolate fry bread to share. The cheese crisp is a waste of time... it isn't bad, but it isn't anything special.... definitely skip (especially for the price... 6$... almost as much as the tacos). The taco was... incredible. It was love at first bite. The green chili pork was slightly spicy, soft, and full of flavor. The beans were delicious (and I don't typically like refried beans at all). The combination of those with cheese, lettuce, and fry bread (and a little of their house hot sauce) was unlike anything I have ever put in my mouth. This cannot be compared to fry bread you get at the fair... this is so much better. I want another.... like right now. 

So what could top the taco? The chocolate and butter fry bread, that's what. The husband was expecting Hershey's syrup.....this was about as far from Hershey's as you can get. Rich, melty, decadent chocolate oozed on top of hot fried dough complemented by melted butter made for one of the top desserts I have had in a long time. This thing is not healthy. I don't care. It was great. 


Take home point: Go here. Close your eyes. Imagine the white tablecloths. Ignore the grungy location. Sink your teeth into some decadently unhealthy deliciousness and smile."}

Coo spot good food !!
Go Native style food cuisine ..
Ka hujka - thank you in Lake Miwok"}
{"text":"This place is a dive but the food is awesome! If you skeeved out by an old building and furnishings then take your food to go. I was a little worried about the food being terrible but it was so good and my mother is a champion fry bread maker! 

I took note of the sanitary aspects -hair nets and gloves. I get freaked out when I watch people make my food at restaurants but it was nice to know they are pretty sanitary despite the building being run down. Just in case you were worried. 

My fry bread was FRESH not greasy and bigger than my face. I got the vegetarian taco which came with hatch chili -it was a little hotter than I like but not overwhelming. The lettuce was green and cheese didn't taste low grade aka imitation cheese or a \"cheese like product\". But next time I will probably get the regular taco because of spice. 

Everyone was friendly, worth the price and I will definitely be back when my little mother refuses to make me fry bread. 

Don't forget to check out little art market located inside with the natives selling their bead work, pottery and jewelry."}
{"text":"If anyone comes to Arizona, what should you try? Fry bread!

At least that's what everyone tells me since I am from California.

Since I already had dinner, I went for the chocolate and butter fry bread.

It's big and be careful when you carry it because you might drop it!!! At least that's what my sister almost did -- what would I have done if the fry bread fell to the ground? :( Probably eat it off the ground! 

So I took a bite into this. My first reaction: Why is this salty? So I was thrown off by the saltiness of it. Some people might think the chocolate and salt compliment each other but I didn't feel it. I love the chocolate on it. 

When you're on a diet, never go to any fry bread house. There's swarms of oil dripping from the fry bread. 

And please share it with your guest. Do not eat one by yourself. 

Overall, it's decent but I wasn't the biggest fan because I didn't like the saltiness of it. (I love chocolate though!)"}
{"text":"The fry bread house is excellent! Great quality fry bread and it is so good. Both the savory and sweet fry breads are great, you have to try then both!"}
{"text":"Very good red chile fry bread tacos, and honey/sugar desert fry bread served sliced ;)."}
{"text":"I'm making an effort to stop by anytime I'm in Phoenix.  The chorizo fry bread taco was beyond anything I've ever tasted before.  We'd never had fry bread but have seen signs for it everywhere driving through the southwest.  We were at Chief Dodges jewelry and they told us we had to try this place, they were right!  Definitely split one if you're not a big eater cuz they are huge.  The staff was really nice, after I told them we'd never had it one of the cooks brought out a fresh one for us to see and the lady at the front went through the whole menu with us.  We went with her suggestion and I'd probably get that again, chorizo taco, and the chocolate and butter fry bread.  Both were phenomenal, I finally realize what everyone is talking about when they say you have to try fresh fry bread!"}
{"text":"So sorry I wasn't hungrier when I stopped here.  I was on my way somewhere else, saw \"Fry Bread House\" and made an abrupt detour.  I ordered the Red Chili Tamale and fry bread with cinnamon & sugar.  Best tamale I've ever had.  The fry bread was less \"doughy\" than I'm used to and I kind of liked the crunchy edges.  There is a back room where NA handcrafted jewelry is sold.  I was drawn to a pretty little malachite pendant and ended up buying two of them.  \"Malachite is for new beginnings,\" I was told.  Perfect."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been back here since they moved from their old location and can I say I am pleasantly surprised. It's a million times cleaner than the old location and has a better feel. Not as big but what are you going to do. The food is still good and the staff just seemed all around friendlier than before. Gonna throw place back into the weekly lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I just love this place and everything about it. The food is great, I would recommend this highly for a casual lunch date."}
{"text":"I am staying at a hotel on Indian School, and this place caught my eye. I know AZ has a fixation with Fry Bread, and felt like giving it a shot. A lady had a table set up, she was hawking jewelry and knick-nacks. Once inside, the atmosphere was like a traditional burrito place, but with a Native American flair to it. I ordered a Carne Asada taco and a \"Chief\" size soda. I helped myself to some complimentary water, and sat at the fast food-style benched table. The meat was great, and tasty, but the whole idea is the Fry Bread that it is served on. Pretty good, flaky, and huge portions. I would recommend for a lunch if you are in the area and feeling a bit adventurous."}
{"text":"After eating here once, it has skyrocketed to one of my favorite places.  The green chile beef is absolutely amazing. No need to pay twice as much at a pretentious place like Richardsons when you get the real deal here! And the frybread was perfect!  The perfect balance between crispy and fluffy. The whole thing just melts in your mouth. Combined with the hatch chile beef, and it is a combo that can't be beat! Unbelievably good! 

Seriously, the negative review that kept me away from here must have been from a hater."}
{"text":"My husband and I make the trek to The Fry Bread House as often as we can. Both the red and green chilies are amazing, and they make the best fry bread, hands down. We usually get the Joad special ( a bowl of chili and fry bread). This time I got adventurous and ordered one of the daily specials - a squash burro. Summer squash, corn, onions and cheese wrapped in a chumuth. It was so flavorful, I had to make myself slow down to enjoy every bite.

Love this place - keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Tried to go to Angelina's but they have not re-opened yet so we ended up here. We both had the green chili frybread and it was great. I still have to say Angelina's is better but this place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Love the fry bread house. I have been going to them for year. My favorite is the red chili. I also love how they give you salsa. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"this place would get 5 stars from me if it weren't for the fact that they're never open when i go. i've called at 7:15 and asked \"What time do you close?\" and they say 8pm. So i drive over there and arrive at 7:30, and they've already closed.

the food is great though, especially the green stew."}
{"text":"1st time coming here, Employees were extremely nice, great set up. I love the way the restaurant looks.  Food was pretty good. 
:) Thank you"}
{"text":"I have been all over the USA and eat out most weeknights.  Why the rest of the world does not know about fry bread I can't figure out why.  The locals told me about this and I was very happy to find it. They have moved down the block.  Got a bean and cheese fry bread and a tamale.  I got a cinnamon and sugar fry bread too.  The bread was fresh and portion was good sized.  It is a hole in the wall but it is good."}
{"text":"The bread was super thick and drippy with grease. I had the \"ultimate fry bread taco\". The veggies were limited and I feel as though I had a can of chili dumped onto fry bread. The service was soooo great that I didn't have the heart to complain but after $40 on two large tacos I didn't care for- I won't be returning simply for the great conversation."}
{"text":"This is out of love i write this review, I have been going for ages to this place, since they moved back to 7th ave again they changed the hot sauce flavor. I asked and they said it was a change from powder to real garlic. This doesnt sound like anything right?

 The problem is it ruined the flavor. I bought like 4 things and smothered it with the sauce that I always loved and it ruined it all. There is a weird taste to it which makes me want to vomit when smelling it now. You can ask for other ok salsa they have, but if anyone is like me or my wife and never knew how it tasted before I am pretty sure you will have a ton of one time customers. It has a fish smell to it now. At first I thought it was the oil they fried the stuff in but then asked the staff and found out what changed. I know it doesnt make sense but it ruined like 45$ worth of food.
If you plan to eat here sample the sauce first or smell it, one of my friends said he couldnt tell but we havent been back in months so he isnt chomping at the bit to go back when it was a weekly thing. The food is still great just dont ruin it with the hot sauce.

 I will take this review down if they tell me they changed it back or wont ever change it back but anyone trying out the food for the first time, it wasnt like this before. The sauce added to the food, the food was epic, now you might accidentally ruin it if you dont know and try the hot sauce now.

update 3/20/2018:

they changed their salsa taste on my last visit with my wife, we were both happy about it. They really need to figure out their weird soda fountain rules though, hence one missing star."}
{"text":"If you put up with their small previous location you will like the larger restaurant and especially the parking. 

Food is still the same which means it is a James Beard Award Restaurant. 

Don't come here for the ambiance or the interior designs, come for any I the Frybread combos or just plain.

I prefer the green chili Frybread Taco and the simple Frybread with honey and white sugar.

They need to add a Navajo Burger (two burger patties in a Frybread with tomatoes and lettuce to their menu, would be a big seller.

Would recommend eating and being done before dark, not the best place at night.

Will come back very soon and would recommend others here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner with the International Supper Club in Dec 2014.  I have gone to the other location and this location didn't disappoint.  One thing is absolutely true about this place, they have delicious food."}
{"text":"ok..so i had a really good friend who took me here a few times...well not here..actually when it was on Indian School and 7th st. it looks so much more inviting now. i just need to bring myself to want to gorge nom nom nom on some fry bread. it's like a big pile of fried crack. you seriously get hooked on the decadent fried morsals. topped with hot and saveries these are just to kill for. maybe even worth dying for. a sweet one is excelent..nom nom nom. ok i think i need to end this post before i eat my keyboard."}
{"text":"This is simple food. Simple, unhealthy ingredients, presented in utilitarian environs.  I had hominy stew and it tasted fine in a Progresso soup kind of way,  but I guess my real disconnect with The Fry Bread House  is I didnt encounter anything remotely interesting - unless you count morbidly obese people on either side of the counter. Maybe I didnt look hard enough.  

I guess for me, the joy of visiting an ethnic place is sampling a bit of the culture gastronomically and through the restaurant's atmosphere - and there doesnt seem to be much joy here. I wont say there's no pride. There's just very little imagination or pizzazz. Maybe it's a traditional culture thing, but I find it kinda sad.   The menu is very redundant. Decor is charmless. Service is not  bad but perfunctory.  The stew was too thin to really slather on my fry bread, and I'm quite certain no one here is concerned about any of it. . 

It presents an interesting contrast with a place like LoLo's. Inexpensive ethnic. Limited, unhealthy menu. Plenty of fat people. Sure, the food's better at Lolo's, but it's deeper than that.  There's an attitude, a pride, an eagerness to show off their skillz that's somehow uplifting and fun, whereas The Fry Bread House comes across, to me anyway, as nondescript and depressing."}
