{"text":"My room was clean and appeared updated. Be prepared to pay for internet if you want to use it in your room. Free in the lobby, $9.95 or $14.95 PER DAY to use it in your room. A bit ridiculous. I'll be staying elsewhere next time. Lots of other options to deal with the hassle."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Clean and quiet. The food downstairs at amp was above average. I would definitely stay again."}
{"text":"Nice property, not a great location.

Good rooms (standard marriott full service rooms), nice lobby, nice courtyard, reasonable gym.

The only complaint I have is the food in the lounge is miserable. The food in the resturante looked good, but I didn't eat there.

Finding dinner near the hotel is difficult, you can't walk to any place, but you could drive 10 minutes to find something."}
{"text":"This hotel has bed bugs. 

Avoid this place at all costs and if your airline offers you a free night, reject it and book elsewhere. My quick stay is now costing me several thousand dollars to eradicate the problem."}
{"text":"I've traveled around a lot and I usually stay at hotels closest to the airport because they tend to be cheaper when you reserve online. One thing I've noticed is that parking, even at airport locations is usually free. I was disappointed that they charged $8 a day for parking. This is a 3 star hotel and while it's clean and the inside is updated, the outside is not and the rooms are not fancy, they should allow parking to be free. 

Upon arrival, I got scared because I thought the interior was going to be as outdated as the outside but I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in.  Everything looked updated, modern decor, there was a bar/Resturant that looked welcoming and the hotel staff were very friendly, efficient and knowledgeable with answers to all our questions. Our room was small but clean, just a regular hotel room typical of any 3 star hotel, bedsheets were clean, pillows soft. 

I stood here and drove to Cedar Point about an hour away, the ride was great. We also went to the Cleveland Zoo, it was about ten minutes away. I loved that Denny's is right next store and open late! There's a gas station and convenience store across the street. My mother loved the courtyard area, I didn't get a chance to enjoy the pool or gym but they do have both.  

I probably would not stay here again because I don't believe in paying for parking at a three star hotel. Aside from the parking, I really didn't feel safe here. There were some undesirable people hanging out in the parking lot. They approached me and my family, they were loud, drunk and obnoxious but I didn't report them to the hotel because they would have known it was us and probably would have damaged our vehicle. Thankfully there were no problems but again, I didn't feel safe and it's really dark in the parking area of this hotel at night."}
{"text":"The staff is great. Everyone was smiles and helpfulness.  

The facility is nice.  It seemed liked the whole hotel was either new or had been recently remodeled.

I gave it 4 not 5 stars because the WIFI is not free in the rooms.  The bathroom door is a sliding door with a ridiculously small handle.  It is a solid wood door with a half inch deep handle.  Rock climbers can have privacy.  Grandma can't.  And if she does get it closed, odds are 50/50 on her being strong enough to open it again.  This might sound funny, but with my six year old on one side of the door and me on the other with no reasonable handle, it was a little irritating.  Oh, and there was no free brewed coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"Been to this hotel several times. Tends to be my go-to when in Cleveland. Love the staff at Amp 150 (the restaurant in the hotel). Mike is fantastic and the seasonal menu keeps things interesting. The staff at Amp 150 deserves 5 stars; they are always attentive and customer focused. Probably the best Marriott restaurant at which I've eaten. I feel bad that I'm giving a low rating but it's absolutely not reflective of the restaurant and the staff (at the restaurant). I had an encounter w/ the hotel staff where I felt discriminated against, and thus the bad review; won't get into it here but have done so w/ the hotel (and will do so on their survey). One bad apple...sigh."}
{"text":"Just for the points is the only reason to stay. 
Beds are comfortable on concierge floor but everything else is sub par. Dirty restaurant, sticky floors, scrappy concierge lounge. Food in restaurant is way overpriced and poor quality. Service weak too. 

Nice people just sort of below expectations.  Including WiFi that keeps knocking you off. Symbolic of a poor commitment to excellence.

Like I said, other than points this is run down, poor leadership, and over the hill property."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, walking distance to light rail station and airport shuttle available. I came out for a baseball game at Progressive Field and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"An unexpected hip and cool lobby buzzing with activity.

The lobby of this airport hotel will surprise you... the lobby bar and surrounding area is full of hipsters. 

Theres even a pool table.

The hotel has been renovated. There are hints this is not a new property, I.e. old finishes on hotel room doors and the piece meal of different wings and elevators.

Putting all that aside, staff is very nice and helpful and the rooms and common spaces have been renovated.

Very likely your best choice for an airport hotel in Cleveland.

Go to the lobby bar and bring your pool cue!"}
{"text":"Excellent hotel, very clean and nice. Good exercise facilities and nice courtyard. Fast and free hotel shuttle. The only drawback is its is not close to downtown if you want to explore there, otherwise it's an excellent hotel! Great service at the hotel also, very good location for small conventions / conferences, etc. The catered food is very good."}
{"text":"We were not impressed with this hotel. Things seemed to go wrong from the start. When we checked in there was a leak from the ceiling onto our toilet. I called, was told someone would be up with keys to a new room, only to get a maintenance man 30 minutes later who told us there were no rooms left and that he was fixing the ceiling right then and there. I called front desk again and they finally sent someone up with keys to a new room. 

Then when we got settled into our room I called to get an extra pillow (it was 8pm by that time). Called an hour later and said, \"I called an hour ago about an extra pillow...\" the lady on the phone, Robin, interpreted me saying,  \"it hasn't been an hour,  your pilow is on it's way.\" She SHOULD NOT be working with customers. Fire Robin. 20 minutes later we get a knock on our door and it's towels, not an extra pillow. How hard is your job? 

I took a shower the next morning and by the time my 10 minute shower was over the water was above my ankles. The drain was completely clogged. Lastly, no clean towels at the pool and the water was FREEZING! 

I wouldn't ever go back or recommend this hotel to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a pre-business dinner meeting huddle at the bar and the service didn't disappoint whatsoever. It's a great location with nice and clean rooms. I'd recommend for any business traveler coming to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Not impressive from the outside, looks older. Very nice lobby laid out well. Enjoyed the citrus water while checking in at the nice front desk.

Enjoyed the local photos as I walked to my room, past the nice pool area. 

This hotel has NO HAPPY HOUR. Be warned.

Rooms are refreshed with wood floor entry and carpet in the room. Small bath with sort of a small counter area. Toilet was right against the wall, felt sort of close. Great shower and water pressure. Bath towels were smaller and more thin than other Marriott's that I'm used to.

Room has a fridge, coffee and tea but no microwave.

Not much in the area to walk to but a Denny's. 

Went to the lobby restaurant with cards all over the ceiling. We saw the bartender talking to another couple and suddenly a card flew up to the ceiling and stuck there, but we didn't see what he did and he didn't offer the same show to us.

Had one of the best burgers here, the double burger with bacon. It came with great fries. I'd definitely order this again! It was a little pricey, tho, at $12."}
{"text":"I have decided on 4 stars not because of the hotel, but because of their smarts in bringing in a fabulous chef to run their restaurant AMP 150.  Breakfast is the usual thing you see in most hotels, but dinner is a DELIGHTFUL experience."}
{"text":"We parked here in May for 8 days, and Marriott provided transportation to and from the airport. We arrived about 5:20 am for our departure and arrived back at 12:30 am, service was outstanding both ways!  Drivers were very nice and professional, we will definitely use this service again!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I didn't actually STAY at the Marriott Cleveland Airport, but the shuttle service impressed me so much that I want to give the driver a shout out.  I was in Middleburg Heights for a work training program, and was booked at the nearby Crowne Plaza while most others in my training were booked at the Marriott. After meeting the others in the Marriott lobby, I found out that the Marriott shuttle driver (a very nice Albanian man) was willing to drive us to a nearby area called Kamm's Corner, which had a few bars and restaurants we were interested in.  Not only did he drop us off right in front of the bar, but he left his number so that we could call him when we were ready to be picked up.  Sure enough, when the night was over and we called the shuttle, he was there at the door of the bar within minutes.  He shuttled everyone over to the Marriott, at which point I asked him about the best way to get a cab back to my hotel.  He would not even entertain the idea of me getting a cab (which he said would cost be at least 20 bucks), and insisted that he drive me back to my hotel himself (probably 15 mins one way).  Given that I was not even staying at the Marriott, and he went way out of his way to drop me off safely, I'd say that the friendly Albanian shuttle driver deserves 5 stars.  Ahhhh, random acts of kindness- they make me so happy!"}
{"text":"Rooms are great, but the staff really makes you feel unwelcomed because you are using your points for the stay #badcustexp @marriot you can do better"}
{"text":"I'm a Marriott rewards member so I feel a bit guilty writing this because other Marriott stays have been stellar. But my stays at the Cleveland Airport Marriott continue to disappoint. Last night was nothing short of bizarrely arrogant and stressful. I was traveling with my handicapped mother and an already stressful situation was made worse by front end staff accommodating business travelers. If you are a business traveler with a company expense account and want to drink at the bar this may be the place for you. But if you are a family member or anyone traveling with handicapped individuals steer clear! There is an exception, Angelo the  shuttle bus driver and also the morning shuttle bus driver, they both are awesome. And the housekeeping staff and management too! In end a couple of the up front staff members tried to make up for all the issues, but it came too late. Sorry, won't be staying here again."}
{"text":"I stay at Marriots very often and this was one of the nicer ones I have been to! 

About a 10 minute drive from the airport to the hotel and there is a complimentary shuttle that runs every 20 minutes. The shuttle driver was very friendly and personable.

It's way bigger than I was expecting it to be. The lobby looks like it was just renovated... everything is nice, new, and modern. The decor is very elegant. I was also pleasantly surprised with the size of the restaurant/bar. 

The people at the front desk were friendly and got me checked in very quickly.

The room that I stayed in was an average size, two beds. I liked the setup of the bathroom because it was a good size and I actually had space to move around. I liked the fact that the bathroom had sliding doors because a lot of the hotels I normally stay at, barely give you any space to close them! The room was very clean and had everything that I needed for my stay!

Would recommend if you're in the area for a day or would like to stay close to the airport and have no transportation."}
{"text":"It was very nice!  The staff member was able to recover an item of mine that I lost.  Awesome!  I liked the layout and the cleanliness.  It was close to the airport and convenient.  What I did not enjoy was the hockey team down the hall. Those kids were playing hockey in the hallways at 10 pm without supervision.  Yes, they were loud."}
{"text":"Outside around the area not so pleasant but this hotel is  very nice and we enjoyed our stay here....came here for a basketball finals.  The restaurant  there was good...like any other hotel food.  The bar I really like a lot....the bartenders very efficient  fast & outgoing.  Nice gym & indoor pool and a super  cute courtyard!!!"}
{"text":"Nice Marriott. Renovation shows, some details still lacking, signage, elevators, etc. all in all solid experience."}
{"text":"I've stayed at a lot of Marriotts over the years and this location went over and above for great service.
They made sure we had plenty of water and the morning buffet was great plus the omelet chef was a nice Suprise to have for a buffet.
Very attentive staff and clean property.
Thank you we will stay here again."}
{"text":"As much as I don't like to be in Cleveland, and especially near Brookpark RD and the airport, this hotel is not all that bad.  It is actually quite nice these days.  The rooms are are not depressing and have a great bed.  In addition, the workout room is great.  I love the tread mills.  They have a great interface to track your distance, time, heart rate, etc...  The concierge lounge is rooming.  They have the typical Marriott food and drinks.  It's on the 9th floor in the second tower (not in the courtyard building).  This hotel is my \"home away from home\" when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Eric W. made a review that I 100% agree with!!! 
\"One star may be a bit harsh but I expect so much more from a Marriott. This place seemed more like a hotel. Looks nice from the outside and nice lobby, then you have to make your way to the room. The front of hotel gives the appearance of being nice then the rest seems more like a motel.\" AGREE.

\"The motel (I mean Marriott) was run down and not at a the level to have Marriott name. IT SHOULD BE DOWNGRADED TO A RESIDENCE INN OR FAIRFIELD INN SUITES. The rooms were fine but old, needs major upgrade.\" MAJOR AGREE.

\"Yankees were in town so rooms were hard to come by but I would never return here, it does not live up to the Marriott name.\" Agree!

This place is a joke. The other day I got in at 5am and was trying to pull my two big (heavy!) suitcases through the round vestibule while two attendants at the front desk just watched me struggle. Then they proceed to put me in the complete and I mean the absolute furthest room from the elevator. Knowing I have these two big bags and that I was only coming here to sleep, checking out same day. (Still never once offered to help me with my bags!) Very rude. 

Fast forward to today... My company books rooms here so I am back (unfortunately) and this morning I ordered a $3 banana just to receive a banana that looked good on the outside but the inside was mushy and brown. (Much like the hotel itself.) 

My thing is, if you're going to take the name of a nice Marriott like in New York, LA, or Miami don't half ass the service. Either give phenomenal service all the time like the other Marriotts in big cities or don't call yourself a Marriott. 

The only good thing I can say about this place is it has an airport shuttle. Food isn't that bad either but that also depends on the chef."}
{"text":"I'm upping my review to five stars. After finding my bag in the bottom of my clothes hamper (random!), I called the hotel to let them know. They couldn't have been nicer. I was fearing that they'd get upset by my guffaw, but they were so sweet, saying they're glad I had my belongings. Exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"Terrible #marriott. I'd be embarrassed if I approved this hotel to carry the name. Front desk people are extremely rude and unaccommodating. They had terrible attitude. I was lied to that all rooms sold out within 2 minutes of checking in for my reservation. Manager got me another room in 5 minutes though and she was nice. Rooms are small and run down. Toilets don't flush properly. I asked for a small salad bowl and they said they don't have any. Even though there is a lobby restaurant. Terrible views and just bad. And I travel for a living. #marriottfail #dontwasteyourmoney."}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. This is a solid airport hotel that is older but updated. The courtyard style hotel was renovated to include a new tower. The two top floors of the tower are the concierge levels and require key-card access. While I stayed on the weekend, the lounge was closed and the offered a breakfast buffet in the restaurant which featured an omelette station.

The hotel was often packed with people coming for family reunions and other events with 2+ events booked each day. The courtyard features a gazebo and chairs with fire pits. The pool is indoor and heated and a good size with a depth of 5 feet.  The service at the hotel and associated restaurant was wonderful and we would return if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place since I'd never been to Cleveland before..and when you hear \"Airport Marriott\" you don't really think of a high-class joint..HOWEVER, the front desk managers were so courteous and attentive. It was something I really appreciated.

The lobby/bar area is really nicely done. Definitely something I could appreciate. I thought the rooms were pretty standard, but you can tell they made an effort to keep the amenities clean and modern. My room was dirty on the first day I arrived, so that was pretty disappointing, BUT i went to the front desk, asked them to give my room a good scrub and it was great by the time I went back to the room.

I liked the fitness center. It had 4 treadmills..but only 3 worked..and of the 3 that worked, only 1 TV had good reception. hahaha, SAD FACEEE. Its not that important tho...the fact that they had more than 2 treadmills AND there was enough SPACE in between them made it easy to get in my workout during my week out here.

I ended up having to work from the hotel a few times and ordered in-room dining. The food wasn't the best..but oh wells, still not as important...

They had great service, i slept well, cushy pillows, and a warm/welcoming lobby. yay!"}
{"text":"Booked this hotel on Park,Stay and Fly as a package deal hotel and airport parking. All I can say is what a deal. The hotel itself is newly remodeled and the rooms were great. common areas are nice as well. The hotel is huge and has lots of banquet space and lots of gated parking. The hotel provides a free shuttle to and from Hopkins airport. We stayed one night and got 7 days of parking for around 100 bucks. At the airport that wouldn't even get you a weeks worth of parking."}
{"text":"Convenience to the airport - 5 stars
Convenience to food- 2 stars
Hotel restaurant- 4 stars
Hotel rooms- 3 stars
Gym and pool- 3 stars
Staff- 10 stars, if I could!


Living out of a suitcase from week to week means I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to hotels. How does this Marriott rate? It's a high 3 stars/ low 4 stars. The staff is excellent. The staff is the reason I like this hotel. The location is meh. Close to the airport which is very convenient getting shuttle rides. However, if you want to eat anything other than hotel food, you'll need a car and it's a hike to civilization. (And no the Denny's next door does not count as food). There isn't even a drug store nearby. 

The rooms are a decent size if you're in the newer part of the hotel. However, the bathrooms are minuscule with no counter space. As you can see from my pictures, I have a LOT of hair and my beauty regimen products do not fit on the counter. I pretty much just keep my toothbrush on it. No room for anything else. 

The restaurant- AMP, is pretty tasty. Good gumbo, burgers and those sea salt fries! Yum! The concierge lounge is in the main building. So be careful which room you're in because if you're in the wrong side of the building you'll walk for days to get there. 

The gym is pretty limited on equipment and gets crowded early in the morning (yes, there are crazy people like me working out at 5 am). The pool is a standard tiny hotel pool, but there is a hot tub. 

The staff is awesome! I'm talking smiles, greeting me by name, leaving hand written cards for me at the desk and in my room. The shuttle drivers who cart me back and forth to the airport remember me. Just this week one of the drivers cleaned the snow off my car and waited for it to warm up before letting me get in it! Seriously, the staff here goes above and beyond. They make my stay here almost feel like I'm at home."}
{"text":"Cake was dope. Salad was dope. Drinks were dope. Was 1/6 dancing at the end, but the light-up rings got the people going. Mullets also must be in? Cavs in 7."}
{"text":"This hotel is OK. What I would normally expect from a Marriott. It's a little rundown, needs renovation and the staff in the restaurant at night could use a serious attitude adjustment. 

However the breakfast staff including Preston are hands-down one of the best things here at this hotel!  And the staff in the lounge are quite lovely as well. 

However the reason I'm writing this review is because of the gym.  I was working out when I noticed that my screen was filthy while working on the treadmill. As I got on the floor to stretch, I realize there is all of this trash and dirt all over the floor. As I looked closer I realized that it's filthy and hasn't been cleaned in who knows how long. 

The cleaning person came in while I was working out yet failed to pick up the headphones that I have shown in the picture below. It's disgusting. 

I think something seriously needs to be done about this. Gross."}
{"text":"The outside isn't much to look out... However, the inside is GORGEOUS!  Very classy.
The rooms are very clean, and the bed and linens are VERY comfortable.
High end hotel in the armpit of Cleveland.
My only complaint is, the wifi is only free in the lobby/business center...  which is unfortunately typical in the more expensive hotels.

If needed, I would defintely stay here again."}
{"text":"Me and three of my business associates checked in and all four of us received handicap rooms. I have nothing against handicap rooms. I've stayed in plenty. I do find it inconvenient to use a sink that's down near my knees (I'm 6' 3\" tall). 

I just found it odd that, 

1. They didn't make us aware we would be given handicap rooms.

2. That everyone in my party got a handicap room. 

3. That someone less able bodied couldn't use these rooms.

I've made it my travel policy to ask for another room if a hotel gives me a handicap room without first telling me first. If they tell me, it's not an issue. In this case, they didn't tell me, so I asked for another room.

I changed my room to a standard rooms (read smaller). The room dimensions were fine and the room was plenty clean. I can't say the same for the restroom. Dirty mirror and pee on the toilet seat. Nice.

The in-hotel restaurant, Amp150, was nice and the food was very good. However, the service was slow."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Cleveland Airport Marriott for the first time - stayed at this hotel for two night. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The hotel itself is an older Marriott and parts of it feel a bit dated - especially the bathrooms and the elevators.

The room had a flat panel HD TV, mini-fridge, and due to my Marriott status, wireless internet access was free. The HVAC worked well and included a digital thermostat control. It was a bit stuffy in the room when I arrived, the room quickly cooled off after adjusting the temp down.

The one thing I will ding the hotel on - the availability of HD channels. They offer some HD channels, but the majority of the channels were in standard definition. Let's get with it Marriott - you have an HD TV in every room, it's time to offer only HD channels. We have no use for SD channels.

There is a small pantry area by the front desk with bottled water, soda, snacks, and toiletries. There is also a restaurant/bar area on the main floor called AMP 150. You can get breakfast and dinner here - not sure about lunch.

Parking is in the rear area of the hotel and there is a fee for it. You'll need to have your room card with you to exit the hotel parking lot as there is a gate.

Service was good, staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great service at the front desk, they have been wonderful and very friendly.  The rooms are clean and nice.  The athroom door, however isn't the best idea with its sliding concept.  Good restaurant; Amp 150 isn't as fancy as most full service Marriotts offer; yet it's decent.  Great location and it's in-between everything.  Third time here and I've always received top notch quality!"}
{"text":"One star may be a bit harsh but I expect so much more from a Marriott. This place seemed more like a hotel. Looks nice from the outside and nice lobby, then you have to make your way to the room. The front of hotel gives the appearance of being nice then the rest seems more like a motel. 

The motel (I mean Marriott) was run down and not at a the level to have Marriott name. It should be downgraded to like a Residence Inn or Fairfield Inn Suites. Parking was atrocious, not enough spaces to accommodate all guests. The rooms were fine but old, needs major upgrade. 

Room was on low floor (although I always request a high floor) near courtyard. It was very loud and I will say the front desk was helpful with this issue, the only good thing about this stay. 

It was about 15 minutes from downtown Cleveland. Yankees were in town so rooms were hard to come by but I would never return here, it does not live up to the Marriott name."}
{"text":"I have been traveling a lot recently and stayed at about all your standard business hotels. My first time in Cleveland but not first in a Marriott, and I have to say this one is a pretty nice Marriott. Clean rooms and sheets. Great shuttle service. And the rooms have basically anything you could want and need. The only minus was the questionable location and the chicken soup on the room service menu. I warn you avoid the chicken soup at all costs!! I am not a picky eater and will eat pretty much everything but this was really hard to down. 
All in all, when in Cleveland, go Marriott."}
{"text":"this place deserves no stars had me stressed out to the point of tears on my wedding day rude unprofessional broken promises all lies they tell and then have the nerve to over charge me smh dont waste your time at this place especially on a special day..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my stay here. Nicely updated rooms, reasonable price. Nice pool and gym. Excellent restaurant, and an extremely pleasant and outgoing staff. High marks! I'd stay here anytime."}
{"text":"I am not going to lie, due to my work I live out of a suitcase and live in a variety of Marriott's. I spent over two months at this property alone. While many may not see this as a full service Marriott, you have to take into account the area and market that you are in. It is the Midwest and you are by an airport. I would give the hotel 3.5 stars if Yelp would allow for you to give half a star.

The hotel itself when compared to other hotels on the same street is the place to stay. They have done a lot of improvements to the hotel, so if you are put off by the outside of the building, you will be amazed by the inside. It has been updated in the past few years and has the current Marriott design, bedding, carpeting, bathroom shampoos, etc. 

Pros:
- Location- It was close to where I was working and the airport.
- Shuttle- They do offer shuttle service to/from the airport, to local offices, and to some of the closer restaurants, but the airport is always their first priority as they do contract with airlines and there are a lot of pilots resting for the night.
- Concierge lounge- They have one and it is on the 9th floor in the tower. It has an honor bar and hot food that looks like you can make a meal out of. 
- The staff was friendly and prompt to help if there was an issue with any of the rooms or if I had any questions
- Close to the Rapid- This allowed you to go into downtown for $5 round trip.
- Gym and pool- They have a pretty decent gym and pool area. The gym is open 24/7 and the pool closes around 10.
Cons:
- Location- It is next to an airport. To get a decent meal, you had to drive 10 minutes to Lorain, take the Rapid downtown, or drive into the suburbs for food. 
- Layout- The rooms are separated into two parts of the building, the tower or the courtyard. If you want to not have to go for a hike to the Concierge lounge, I recommend staying in the tower.  
- Concierge lounge- While I can no longer eat cookies, you better like cookies. The lady who normally works Sunday- Thursday in the longue only \"bakes\" and that will be your option for dessert. This seems pretty lacking compared to other lounges. 
- Noise between rooms- I hate adjoining rooms, yet seemed to get put in them multiple times. To muffle the sound, I generally suck a towel in the crack of the door. Also, as others have said, the pluming is just loud. 
- The doors on the rooms themselves- I don't know if the doors on the rooms were designed to be slanted and have a huge gap at the bottom due to safety reasons or what, but it just seemed odd. It also seemed like some doors had a wider gap than others I just but a towel down at the bottom to block out the light and noise from the hallway.

If I am every in the area again, I would definitely return. Also, if you are assigned room 988, I would recommend changing to another room. This room is right next the lounge and shares a wall with the Concierge lounge Kitchen which can get loud, especially if you are not a morning person as they open at 6 am."}
{"text":"For a Marriott, really you have a boat load of room to improve.....  At this rate comfort inn just has to keep the doors open.  Let's pick it up will ya!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference a renovation on a hotel makes.  I stay here once a quarter for work, and this is one of the few hotels I really enjoy.  The rooms are nice...there's hard wood floors, a nice flat screen tv, large bathroom...and the restaurant...wow, for hotel restaurants, this place rocks.  The gym is great, as well- large with lots of machines with individual tvs.  The only real downside is that it's in kind of a random location, with not a lot nearby...but if I have to travel to Cleveland for work, I certainly don't mind having to stay here."}
{"text":"Updated hotel with great staff. Hotel lobby is nice with good beer menu and food. I will definitely stay again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Not up to the standards I have come to expect from a Marriott property especially a full-service Marriott property. Customer service and front desk left much to be desired and why the rooms were nice the hallways and some of the other areas looked really dated. The thing that really made me unhappy was when I checked in around 830 at night and I was put on a room facing the highway and it was very noisy. It's not like I had just booked the room two hours before I showed up I had booked the room weeks in advance."}
{"text":"This was the only Marriott or Hilton with a room.
The room is OK but it is a long ways away from everything.
The concierge lounge is a good hike from my room and in a different tower.

The worst is the toilet tank takes ten minutes to refill.

I am only here for nine hours, so I will get over it and choose somewhere else next time.

This place is not worth the 266.00 per night charges..."}
{"text":"I was excited to get here after an 8 hour drive but was really dissapointed. When we first got into our room the door would not close. So we had to have someone contact Maintenance for us to fix the issue. After putting my bags down on the floor I see that there is a long grey sock sitting right under the side of the bed. Everything in this room is covered with dust. I don't think anyone even cleaned these rooms before we came. It's definitely dissapointing to plan a trip and your hotel is in disarray.

Will not be coming back. Shouldn't have to be inconveineced in the first 2 minutes you step through the doors of this hotel."}
{"text":"Old, and in need of a renovation!  The hotel is large, the layout is confusing, but there are some good things too. They have a nice restaurant bar in the lobby and also a full service Starbucks. The staff is very friendly and overall the hotel is clean. They have an indoor pool that is better than most and a fitness center that is well equipped. Parking is plentiful, Denny's next door, fast station across the street. I'd stay again but it's time for a face lift."}
{"text":"Hotels near airports aren't all skeezy, but the ones that aren't unfortunately get lumped together with the ones which win the skeezy awards. I was flying back home to Seattle from Erie, PA, and encountered a very late first flight which caused me to miss my connecting flights home. Continental Airlines hooked me up with a voucher for a room and a meal until I could get the flight home the next morning, and the Marriot is where they sent me. 

Pros:
-Free airport delivery shuttles take you to and from the airport, and come every 20 or so minutes. 
-Check in was quick (under 10 minutes), even with the line of flight attendants and other guests who had hotel vouchers. 
-My room was equipped with the standard things you find, but included a king bed and above average quality toiletries that didn't bug my picky skin. 
-The hotel restaurant offered a nice selection of small plates, apps, and larger plates which were reasonably priced, even for a hotel restaurant. An emphasis on locally sourced and organic food seemed to be a source of pride, and most of the beer and wine was local as well. 

Cons:
-My bathrooms plumbing was LOUD- I could easily hear the guests above and to the side of me flushing their toilets. But thats my only complaint. I would imagine more expensive rooms not specifically reserved for overnight airport people would have less hallway traffic and better wall insulation. For being so close to the airport, I surprisingly didn't hear any overhead airplane noise. 

All in all, I spent probably 9 hours total here. I don't see myself ever needing to stay in this particular hotel again, but it's definitely a good stop if you get bumped or need a place to stay for a couple nights near the Cleveland airport."}
{"text":"The hotel is a little dated and a little below marriott standards. The other contributing factor to my rating is their lack of customer service when it counts. I needed to make the 4:40 am shuttle to the airport. I called the desk at 4:38 and said I was on my way down. They said they would hold it for me but when I walked outside at 4:42 no shuttle. When I inquired one told me she tried to hold it while another said they couldn't. I ended up being late to the airport and closer than comfortable to making my flight. I think I will stay elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Good price and ok location.  This place is a loud party hotel so beware.  Very noisy until all hours of the night.  The staff at this property is horrible.  Bartenders and cleaning staff in particular are not too bright.  Rooms are very average and tough to cool down."}
