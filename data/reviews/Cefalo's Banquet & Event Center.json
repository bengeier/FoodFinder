{"text":"The Staff at Cefalo,

    I would like to thank you all for doing such an amazing job!!!!  Len did an amazing job coordinating everything down to the little details.  I live in Chicago and he made everything so accommodating.  The day was PERFECT and was without a doubt the best day of our lives thanks to you.  I would like to thank Dean for the food because it was excellent.  I have received several comments from the my guests on how great the food tasted.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and the crab cakes were just delicious.  One guest commented that it was her best crab cake she had ever tasted and even better than the ones she has had on the coast!!!!  The lobster bisque was to die for!!!!!  Also I would like to thank your servers and bartenders who did a fantastic job.  The service was great and no one was kept waiting.  I would also like to thank Amy for everything as well. The whole day was perfect because of all of you!!!    :o)

Thanks,
Heather"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing -- I got salmon with cranberry sauce, and I asked for it as raw as they'd let me have it. It was gorgeous.

There's a nice, quieter seating area for large groups in the back (we were a group of ~20) and smaller tables in the main room that surround a stage/set. Live music apparently is a staple of this restaurant, but I couldn't hear it from our room in the back.

The restaurant is in a converted church, which makes the outside fairly impressive. Valet parking (flat fee $5), or wherever you can find."}
{"text":"The food is OK.  The service is awful.  The staff is rude & condescending.  Not what you would expect if you are at a nice event.  All I can say is: Do not think of throwing an event here - your guests will be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a venue!  The food is outstanding and the service is even better. If you're looking for a place to have that special event, this is it. Family-owned and top notch from start to finish.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had my 40th class reunion here on Saturday night.  What a great venue!  It was perfect for our group (which was about 100 people).  It's an old church with beautiful stained glass windows and lots of different seating areas.  They had a great sound system too. We had a cash bar and lighter food since we didn't have the resources to have a sit down dinner.  By the way, Len Cefalo, the owner of this wonderful space, worked with us and was so accommodating since we didn't actually know how many were actually going to attend.   It couldn't have turned out better.  The food and service were terrific.  I would recommend Cefalo's if you want a greta space for your next event."}
{"text":"Really unique event center. Beautiful inside. Food was excellent. Would have been five stars but everyone, from the bartenders to the waitstaff, was either inattentive or grumpy or both. Our table never got water refills and didn't get coffee until everyone else was already getting their second mug -- someone came up to us to ask if we wanted refills! When our plates were taken away we all said, \"Thank you,\" but the server couldn't even hazard a smile."}
{"text":"Came to a wedding here and was blown away by it. The food was outstanding and service was even better. Would definitely recommend this place. Had a great time."}
{"text":"NIce looking venue but what a disappointment.  Awful food.  My \"new york strip\" was the approximate shape of the state of Virginia and full of gristle and fat, in no way a strip steak at all. I don't know who they thought they were fooling.  Ordered medium rare and it came out well done as well as mushy.  And no I didn't send it back sicne they couldn't even get the cut right.  Garlic potatoes were food service or at least tasted that bad.  My husband ordered the pork loin with Thai sauce, which was ridiculously dry and tough. The lobster bisque is good but not worth coming to such a bad place.  The staff could use some manners too, and something better to wear than black t-shirts and pants. Yelling across the room for more menus etc, is a shame as such a nice looking place.  It certainly isn't the classy \"rat pack\" dinner club that the website claims."}
{"text":"I attended a wedding last night at Cefalo's. This was the first time I had ever been to this charming banquet facility (it's in a converted stone fa√ßade church) and I was very pleased with my experience as a guest.
We used the available valet parking which was a convenience I appreciated.
Instead of describing the rooms myself, I recommend that you visit their website and view the pictures there to get an idea of the interiors and examples of different event layouts.  I loved the large stained glass windows behind the bar and I also thought that the balcony that overlooks the room that was used to announce the bridal party was a nice feature.  I felt the balcony was a little dark when the bridal party was announced but it looks better lit in the pictures on the website so maybe that isn't always the case?
I thought the food was excellent.  During cocktails, each appetizer that was brought around to the tables was more delicious than the one before! For dinner, everyone at my table had either steak or chicken and all agreed that their meals were very good and that the portions were quite large.  My chicken was nicely cooked, very juicy and delicious! This was the best meal that I can recall ever having at a wedding! I also really enjoyed the almond cake that was served (not too sweet!).
Every staff member I encountered was very personable. The food and drink was served quickly and always with a smile.
On the way out we met Len (one of the owners) and I was glad to get the chance to tell him how much I enjoyed my evening as a guest at his venue!"}
