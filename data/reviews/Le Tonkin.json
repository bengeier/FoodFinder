{"text":"On a tous NOTRE petit resto chinois. C'est le miens! Quand je veux un bon gros repas soupe, rouleaux, general tao, banane frite pour 20$ environt c'est ma place. C'est un apporter votre vin et les portions sont généreuse, on dois s'atendre a rien d'exceptionel mais c'est réconfortant que le menu et le gout ne change pas. L'ambiance est très calme, on entend parfois que le silence.. Mais les Samedis soirs c'est bondé!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here at least once a week for a few months now as it's near my work so excuse my biased star rating.

The phõ at Le Tonkin varies from average to good, sometimes a bit on the salty side. My favourite meal so far has been the vermicelli platter with three meats. It comes with an imperial roll and the choice of a nice, light house soup or Tonkin salad for $17. Their calamari comes either as an appetiser or a plate with rice and salad (same portion size) and is decent but a bit over salted. Every other dish I tried here has been average to great with no other standouts.

Service is quick, even during slower periods. A good option if you are looking for a quick meal. Expect to pay 1-2$ more than you would in Chinatown. As another poster has stated, I wish I could give them a 3.5."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. For the price, this is a solid choice for simple, fresh, great tasting meal. It has good portions, fresh food, and a nice casual clean atmosphere. Family owned and run by a very nice husband/wide duo. Simple Vietnamese options for the uninitiated. The Pho is really good too.  Again, for the type of establishment and expectation for this type of option, it's a great choice"}
{"text":"Tried out le Tonkin on Saturday evening with a group of friends and overall enjoyed the experience. The resto itself is located in Little Italy and is a BYOW resto. Metered parking is free on Saturday night after 6pm and definately recommend making reservations as the resto is quite busy as it has gained popularity for it's good and inexpensive food dishes.  The resto itself has a cozy feel good feeling as soon as you enter the resto and menu has a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Tried out their hunan dumplings with peanut butter sauce and their tonkonese soup..both were tasty and perfect for a Fall evening. I recommend sharing entrees and main dishes as the portions are quite huge. The soups come in medium, large and extra large sizes.....if you plan on sharing entrees...I recommend the medium size which is a perfect portion which will not leave you feeling stuffed. Check out my pics for food diishes."}
{"text":"Un méli-mélo bien étiré, à tort, sur l'imaginaire préconçu. Le Tonkin nous propose un brouillon culinaire presque pan-asiatique. Le fameux poulet du général Tao illustre d'ailleurs le menu. Déçu. 

Toutefois, la composition du plat (vermicelle aux rouleaux impériaux) se dresse favorablement par l'autenticité de sa sauce aux poissons. À la fois relevée et justement sucrée. 

Je félicite le service, car malgré un français quoique sommaire, notre serveuse a exercé un effort bienséant."}
{"text":"Good byob option in Little Italy.  Had the Won Ton soup, scallops and fried pineapple.  All were very good. This is not a fancy restaurant, but met our expectations and them some. If you are in the mood for Asian food this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty standard East Asian fair, nothing extraordinary, you can have better and cheaper prices in Chinatown. Decor nice, but again nothing special, service very good and personable. Good for groups, very accomodating, but overall, try Chinatown first."}
{"text":"\"The best food is in the little joints\"

How often have you heard that one? Well Le Tonkin is no exception to this rule! Beautiful discovery in the Italian Village!

Do not be mistaken by the simplicity of the look from outside, as once you are inside, you will be welcomed by a family that loves to laugh and serve. Then you will rediscover the amazing sensation of having  flavors exploding at ounce in your mouth as you taste the vietnamese flavors in front of you.

And can I say enough how affordable it is!

On my fave list!

\"La meilleure bouffe est dans ces petits restos qui n'ont l'air de rien de l'extérieur\"

Combien de fois avez-vous entendu ce dicton? He bien le Tonkin ne fait aucunement exception à cette règle! Une magnifique découverte dans le village Italien de Montréal.

Ne soyez pas trompés par le look extérieur simple de ce petit bijou car une fois entré, vous serez accueilli par les rires et la chaleur de la famille qui tient ce resto. Ensuite, vous redécouvrirez la sensation exquise de 5 savers qui explosent en même temps dans votre bouche lorsque vous dégusterez les différents plats offerts.

Et puis-je dire assez à quel point c'est abordable!

Sur ma liste de coups de coeur!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I read a review before I get there, and forget that someone else's 5 star, may not meet my expectations. In the case of Le Tonkin, this is what happened.

If I could rate 2.5 I would have, and this is why:

I'd like to begin with how accommodating this restaurant was to our group, and was quite patient, as well as tried to meet our \"off menu\" request. For that, I felt like the effort was put in, and should my friend have wanted an authentic Chinese dish, we may have been better off going to a restaurant specializing in Chinese cuisine. 

I ordered a Noodle Dish with Chicken and Vegetables in the Bird Nest Style, and although may have been okay in most respects, the noodles were a bit too thick, and the sauce was just a soy based sauce, and perhaps too salty for my liking.  Did I eat it? Yes I did. Did my dinner companions try it and like it? Yes, they did say how good it tasted. 

I guess being in Vancouver, I got spoiled by the awesome Asian cuisine, and after the 5 star review, I got my hopes far far up.

Decor-wise definitely cleaner and nicer than most of the whole in wall types located in Montreal's own China Block (I can't call a few streets a town).  There were many groups there and they seemed to have truly enjoyed their meals too. 

For dessert, I picked up a fried banana, soaked in syrup, and it was crispy, not too oily, and hit the spot. I think in that sometime in the near future, to give this place a fair shake, I'm going to have to come back, and try it again, and give it due process.

I would like to reiterate though, that the service was lovely."}
{"text":"I went there one time, not too long ago. It's a safe bet for tonkinoise soups. My friend took the General Tao, it was good, but we all know better places around. It's a quiet restaurant, a bit retro. Anyway, you go there for the soup, not the walls. Portion are good, a lot of meat and the stock is good too."}
{"text":"I'd be happy to give Tonkin a 3.5 star if that were possible, it really is a solid option up in Little Italy for fresh and super tasty Asian food. I certainly agree with Clare L that the menu is a little multi-national to be successfully authentic Vietnamese but I can sympathize with the logic that puts General Tao on a menu while trying to stay afloat on a sparse-ish stretch of street. (This strip is brightening quickly though and no doubt Tonkin's kindly fresh face is helping make the change.)

The grilled chicken pho and rare beef are both delicious, inexpensive, light and perfect for delivery when you're feeling under the weather or you know, just lazy. The beef balls weirded us out because of the texture, and the ribs were disappointing but in both cases this was due to our misguided expectations not kitchen problems. The imperial rolls are good stuffed stuffs - not greasy, light, yummy enough that these days we each get our own order (screw you sharing!) The house soup is a hot and sour that, while not life changing, has the proper bite and fresh ingredients. 

Tonkin is a solid A-OK and a half and I'm so glad they are among the people in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sans aucun doute le meilleur resto vietnamien du secteur. Personnel attachant et serviable, les portions sont généreuses, savoureuses et abordables. Possiblement le meilleur calmar frit (à la vietnamienne) en ville."}
