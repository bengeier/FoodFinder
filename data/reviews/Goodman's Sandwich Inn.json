{"text":"Apparently has new owners, but they haven't changed anything.

Pros:
-Excellent quality meat
-huge pile of food (platter of 4 meats) for $12
-manager was great

Cons:
-waitress seemed unfamiliar w/ menu. She got my order wrong then upon fixing it tried to charge me more, i had to point out that I'd paid the correct amount in the first place
-$1.50 for a can of coke seems a little steep"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and parents (who have been getting Goodman's sandwiches as a treat since I was a kid) this past weekend. The new owners have got it right! The sandwiches are amazing!!!! Potato salad is just like grandma's (in a fabulous way!) and service was excellent. We ate at the lunch counter and enjoyed watching the cooks make other people's meals.

The new owners are keeping all the \"oldies but goodies\" and also experimenting with adding a few more offerings. For example, they've added a Reuben and are trying out some other sources of meaty happiness: we got two free Chicago dogs to try and they were amazing! They really treated us special and it was awesome!

For those who say \"don't bring a date here\" - I disagree - if you and your date are foodies, most who know 'atmosphere isn't everything' and that 'holes in wall' often are the source of the very best food - then you'll love the 50s lunch counter!!

You won't be disappointed - this has got to be the best place to get corned beef in Cleveland, and one of the best places to eat there period! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I found Goodman's by accident, and I can't be happier about it.  

It's a dirty, crummy place run by an old Jewish guy (he's in his 90s) who opened up his first sandwich place in Brooklyn, New York.  

Goodman's braises their own meat in house and stacks it high on their wonderful bread.  Lightweights should stick with the half sandwich options (it's plenty for me).  If you eat at Goodman's you'll experience the distinct pleasure of having the best corned beef sandwich you can find. 

This is a diner with a lot of character, a long history, and great food.  You won't regret cracking open a can of pop, mowing on some fries, and indulging in one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have. 

A few tips -- Don't take a date there.  The place is a dirty diner.  Goodman's does not accept credit cards, so be sure to take cash.  Also, they don't have beer, but their cans of pop complement the corned beef nicely."}
{"text":"Is this place really called the \"Sandwich Inn\"?  I've always just known it as Goodman's.

In any case, I have been going there since I was child.  My parents got me hooked on corned beef at a young age, and let me tell you something else: PICKLES.

The short bar with its little stools has probably been there since my dad was a boy - the decor has not been renovated, it doesn't seem - which is seriously awesome, if you ask me.  It's like going back in time to an old diner.  Except it's now.  And everything is old.  There is a place to hang your hat on the wall.  So, you know, wear your hat.

The food's great, the staff is hilarious.  They serve the champagne of beers.  Really, it's heaven on earth.  In an ironic sort of way.  But seriously.

I recommend following up your lunch with a trip to Jack Frost Donuts down the street, for an Old Brooklyn culinary tour."}
{"text":"Sadly the owner has retired!!!  I found out the hard way when I stopped in for a sandwich.  

New owners bought the place but I haven't tried it.  Not sure if they bought the recipes too or not.  When they are up and running I will give it a try, but I have a hard time thinking it will even come close."}
{"text":"While I wouldn't eat here every day for fear of my heart exploding, I could definitely handle one of their corned-beef-and-Swiss on any day that ends in \"-Day.\" Real old-school place with old-school service -- don't expect to impress a first date here. I think they have beer too, a thought that makes me just want to make one of their booths at the back my permanent residence."}
{"text":"Best corned beef in Cleveland.   Forget what you have heard about slyman's, or anyother place.  This is the gem that no one really knows about.

The place has horrible atmosphere - but that is not what you should be there for :)"}
{"text":"Goodman's can be described in one word: character. Its food and the people running the show. Wood paneling. A long, white diner counter. Looks the same since the 80s, I guess. 

Goodman's has been in a dilapidated stripmall for over 25 years but there's still reason to visit. Our server was a character. Calling my water as a vodka on the rocks and an ice tea as a long island. She gave a regular [who called ones of her rhymes a ''pathetic rap''] a retort of 'it's not as bad as your rap sheet.' Thought aloud that toothpaste originated in West Virginia. Gave good service to us. 
No wait to sit down at lunchtime on a weekday. 
Food itself: 
I had a corned beef and swiss cheese: it was very good. The corned beef: Not very peppery. Soft, without much fat, moist [only dry on 1 or 2 pieces of the 8-10 they slapped on], Tastes better than my Grandpa's.  1/2 of a sandwich was ~$5.  

On my way to the bathroom, I passed the huge pans of the corned beef, just out of the stoves in the kitchen ready to be methodically shaven [yes, you read that right]. Too bad they were out of their only beer selection [MGD, nothing less] when I was there. 

Been years since I was at Slyman's so I can't compare but this is a very solid pick if you're looking for corned beef."}
{"text":"It looks just like an old fashioned corner deli. All kosher specialties. You can eat in or take out. They slice the corned beef in the window- nice. You can order it lean or even extra lean for higher price. They have sesame candies and halva, too. I saved the best for last- this is the best corned beef in Cleveland. The Plain Dealer and professional reviewers hype Slyman's Grease Palace all the time, and Goodman's gets little recognition, and that's a down right shame, cuz this is the best deli on the West Side."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite at Goodman's, but this time, I brought friends.  Couple of co-workers were in the mood for sammiches on a recent lunch outing so I thought I'd introduce them to Goodman's.

We all ordered corned beef on rye.  Not much variety, but the sandwiches were delicious as usual.  

I don't remember the prices being this high before.  It was $15.00 for a sandwich, a side of coleslaw, a sprite and a small tip.  Wow, that's a bit much for a diner sammich.  

Anyway, the corned beef sammiches are some of the best around.  Keep it up, Goodman's!"}
{"text":"Best hand carved corned beef ever!  Be prepared to wait, there is always a line but well worth the wait.

Slymans down the street is machine carved and a little dryer.  Slymans is also great, probably *only* a delicious 4 star, but you will not be disappointed with Goodman's in any way!"}
