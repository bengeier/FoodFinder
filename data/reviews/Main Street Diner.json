{"text":"They have always been the most convent diner due to their central location.  But what makes you come back is the warm family experience, and consistent food.  They do off substations/illuminations.  And fresh brewed coffee, before most other stores open in the morning.  I hope the rumour of a new restaurant taking their space comes true."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place. Fast service, warm food, good prices, & none of that generic \"big box\" restaurant chain feel  :)"}
{"text":"This place has a really friendly and familiar feeling, staffs are really king especially the little girl! Breakfast aren't that great and comes in a small portion in my opinion. The bathroom is pretty gross but overall the breakfast aren't that bad but I really love the atmosphere of this place"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, food is good and prices are cheap! I recommend this restaurant to anything is looking for cheap quality food."}
{"text":"This diner is such a cute place, and a great stop if you're looking for breakfast! The menu is simple, the staff are friendly, and the prices are decent. The thing I really liked about this place was the eclectic dishes and salt & pepper shakers. They were different for each table, which was a nice, homey-feeling touch!  I love breakfast places, and it seems there are so few in Newmarket! There's a chain breakfast place across the street (won't name names), but this place is so much more comfortable-feeling."}
