{"text":"Place is disgusting...I make better burgers at home and the fries are disgustingly disgusting.  This place won't last if people know what good food is."}
{"text":"If you're gonna indulge in a burger and fries, I would have to say this is as healthy as it gets! I've only had their burger and fries, and I'd give it a 10/10. The price is obviously a bit more expensive than any other burger take out, but it is totally worth it.   Customer service is great! you'll get your burger in less than 5 minutes if they're not busy.   And most importantly, they are clean!   two thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for burgers!! Way cheaper than burger priest as their burgers are bigger. Fries are great. Poutine is too salty - they need to reduce sodium in the gravy."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service with great food. The portion sizes are huge and you'll go home stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"Well above average burgers, real real beef !   Tasty Burgers and soft toasted buns with all the toppings.  Been here several times since they opened.  Have not found a burger place in the area as good as this.   The Bigboy burger combo is excellent.  Pop refills as well.  Better than Wimpys !"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the commitment to quality.  Burgers and fries are very good but the souvlaki salad blew away some greek restaurant salads.  Fresh romaine, grape tomatoes and real feta plus red onions.  No skimping here for sure.  I posted a photo of the souvlaki dinner I had today.  Looked great right in the container just like the photo.  Never had a bad meal there yet and I have been at least 8 times.  Impressive quality plus very pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Staff were helpful and polite. Burger was real meat, like others I'd suggest it needed a bit more seasoning, but they do offer bbq and other sauces which fill the gap.  The rings are like Harvey's, maybe a little less salty.  Fries are excellent for salt & vinegar.  Poutine was weird - Fries, brown sauce and something that looked like curds, but seemed a bit more like cream cheese in a curd shape.  Was disappointed by this.  Highlight: Ordered a deep-fried Mars bar, but was told they were all out.  After we'd finished eating and were heading out the door one of the staff chased us down and gave us one (no charge).  It was AWESOME! One of the staff had run to the nearby variety store and bought some."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a year.  The food is good, and the prices are reasonable.  Its a family run chain - they have another location.  The burgers remind me of the way Harvey's used to be 20 years ago, when their food was edible.   The fries are great, and I recommend the gravy."}
{"text":"Was looking for a burger place that didn't close at 7pm(and not Mcds) on a Sunday night. First time so thought I'd try it out. Great burger and fries tastes great. Would have been 5* but they didn't ask me what I wanted on the burger(said everything) and even after I told them what I wanted, relish and hot peppers ended up on. And I hate relish and just picked off the hot peppers. Not a big deal but I guess that's what u get on a Sunday night after a long week."}
{"text":"It's pricey...but you get American sized portions,  so if you're in the mood for a binge day or cheat day - this place is great. They have poutine with curds which is more than I can say about anywhere else near by.  FOR THE ULTIMATE BINGE MEAL. get a half pounder with cheese and bacon combo with everything on it with an upgrade to poutine and a milkshake. Best take it home...because if you manage to eat it.. its the last thing you'll be able to do for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I've driven pass this place many times.  I finally decided to give it a try.  Sure glad I did.  The first time I ordered chicken souvlaki, pork souvlaki and poutine.  The salad that comes with the souvlaki dinners was very good - it was a good size and make with fresh ingredients.  The chicken and pork were both good.  I believe they are made on site.  The poutine was huge.  They cut the fries on site.  The second time I went, I ordered a gyro dinner and burger.  The gyro looks like it was pre-made somewhere else...it was good, but not great.  The burger was really good...better than you would get a franchise joint...better than Hero burger and South St.  But not as good as Big Smoke Burgers, Beaconsfield Burgers, Burger's priest.  The employees are friendly and provide good customer service"}
{"text":"I have never seen any fries that are so thick!! Just like my fatty fingers. They are crispy too. Taste delicious just with ketchup.  The burger, however, is SALTY! I am eating the burger with the bun, lettuce, tomato slices and pickle slices. Yet, I could still taste the saltiness from the patty. The burger is over priced."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A friend of mine told me about this place. I never heard of it so I wasnt expecting anything spectacular but when i walked in and saw their way of cooking and serving and their burgers taste amazing and the prices are very good considering their great quality. Very nice people who love the business work there as well. Will go back again. Gotta try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Gone are the days of the classic roadside burger joint, you know the type, the ones that Danny Zuccho and the T-birds would meet up at with their gals for a burger and a shake. Classic burger joints that don't need secret menus, nearly illegal spiced peppers and every ingredient in the refrigerator to make their burger rock, just three basic ingredients; beef, grill, fire -- that's it.  ... or so I thought!  I had my first encounter with Big Boy's Burgers last week during #BurgerBingeWeek, and man was I shocked at what I was provided. I massive patty started and pressed on flat top before being transferred and finished on the fire grill. This method is an excellent way of cooking a burger as the flattop cooks the burger in it's own juices keeping it moist while the finish on the grill gives it that BBQ taste and char that makes a class burger a burger.  This burger came with cheese and bacon as well as my choice of toppings all piled between a thick bun, perfect for holding all that content (and their juices) together.  I had only ordered the burger but mistakenly the team tossed in some of their fresh cut fries. I noted the mistake and they were kind enough to say \"don't worry about it they're in the bag already\"!  I decided to be polite I'd have only a few, but the moment one of those perfectly cooked, thick, freshly cut fries hit my lips it was game over, took my about 30 seconds to go from overflowing french fry container to licking the paper of my bag (SMH) - Damn you guys, there goes my failed attempt at a healthy lunch.  Well worth it though.  I really dig the authenticity and taste Big Boy's puts together and with a convenient road side location just south of Bayview and Elgin Mills I know this won't be my last visit.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!  I'm no burger connoisseur but I've had my fair share of burgers ... whether it be webbers up on Hwy 11 or Burger Priest downtown.  But Big Boys has the best burger patty I think I've ever had.... it's thick, flavourful, juicy and charbroiled just right.  It requires no additional condiments on the burger.  I could eat the patty on its own!  The fries are thick cut fries.. they're good, but a bit on the heavier side.  I need to come back to try the other menu items.  Their souvlaki and chicken fingers look good too!"}
{"text":"Great burger, real home cut fries, gravy is so-so.  Take advantage of the $5 deal. Friendly service.  Worth a visit in this competitive burger market."}
{"text":"It's a good bugar and you get a good portion too it was good I was fool too try it out you will love to have a nice lunch"}
{"text":"Big price for small quality, paid $16 for a big boy combo, let's just say the ketchup wasn't Heinz, the fries had too many bits and end pieces which means the fries are too big and the potato breaks off.  The meat is not even their own and it tasted like a cheap breakfast sausage.... if you're gonna charge big prices then give good value, the value here is lost, won't be back."}
{"text":"Great burger experience at a decent price, in the age of ultra Gourmet Ultra expensive Burgers these guys are doing it right and not putting the boots to you price wise. Enthusiastic foodie on the cash, delivering friendly service, making recommendations, suggested they make a really great melt-in-your-mouth steak sandwich or cheesesteak, and even threw in a free order of Special Sauce, recommending we dip the onion rings. Why anyone would head a little further south on Bayview and get FROZEN supermarket 'crispy fries' from the megabyte joint when super-fresh delicious burgers and real fresh-cut fries are available just up Bayview a couple blocks, is just beyond me! Just say \"No!\" to deep fried crap from the freezer, and drive a couple extra blocks to get the real deal from Big Boy Burgers!"}
{"text":"Nice large burger with fresh toppings. I liked the lettuce and tomatoes, but I found the meat a bit like the frozen pattys from the supermarket. It didnt seem like freshly pure ground beef. I also would've liked more char in the burger. Overall I still enjoyed it over McDonald's and Burger King, but I wouldn't rank it as highly as the other reviewers"}
{"text":"Today, I purposely brought a friend to try this new joint. We were excited with all the variety and the decor. The cashier was happy to tell us how their food was prepared and what was in each item since it was our first time. We ordered a philly cheese steak and a 1/4 burger. The service was quick but the food did not live up to what we expected. It was mainly starch and bread with little meet. The $11 Philly cheese steak was a let down; little meat and basically a flatbread. The burger was much better but was not as good and succulent as a burger from Wimpy's or Joe's Hamburgers."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious. It was huge. Option available to add a side to a yelp burger. Service was Ok, polite but not overly friendly."}
{"text":"Went there today with my son to try the poutine, also had a chocolate shake. It was amazing! Best poutine I've had in a while, great gravy, real cheese curds and home cut fries, incredible. Shake was very solid as well. Later that day I had a craving for a gyro so I went back there tonight with my wife for a quick gyro and vanilla shake. This is going to be very dangerous having this place 8 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"I've visited this place about four times. The menu has a decent amount of options. From steak sandwiches, to souvlaki and gyro wraps, they aren't your typical burger place. I always just get the Big Boy Burger combo with a poutine, that's just my go to at a burger joint. To review the food, the burger is indeed quite big as advertised...The poutine was pretty good, not my favourite, VERY salty, thick potatoes. The burger was tasty, also kind of salty. Their options of condiments are good, variety of tasty sauces and fresh veggies. I would say the burger is pretty comparable to Hero Certified Burgers, but a little bigger. Very standard prices for a burger joint you're looking at spending around 9-14 dollars. I actually kinda like the layout of the restaurant, its cool and different. Every Time i've been there they've been playing EDM on Sirius XM, which is kind of cool and different.   All in all i'd say its a good place to eat and i'd rather spend my money here keeping this place alive than most chain burger places. But im only going to give it 3 stars...cause im a harsh critic and i only want to give the best of the best 4 stars and above. I would give it 3.5 stars if i could...get on that yelp  CL"}
{"text":"I driven past a lot of places like 'Big Boy Burger' and now I realize I've made a TERRIBLE MISTAKE!  This place is worth trying, especially if you love homemade fries and onion rings! I purchased a 1/2 pound big boy burger with onion ring and my heart skipped a beat. I AM IN LOVE!  My burger was cooked perfectly and paired with an equally perfect pile of onion rings.  The only reason I did not give them a 5 out of 5 is because the condiments and burger toppings are seriously lacking.  'Big Boy Burger' should not be overlooked!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best burgers in the GTA! I had the Big Boys burger. Everything about the burger tasted wholesome, delicious and fresh. None of that artificial crap from other burger joints. The burgers were also huge! The burgers and fries were enough to fill me up for most of the day. Staff were also really friendly and informative. The only thing I would change about Big Boys would have to be the prices - especially for the toppings. It's about a dollar extra for each topping that you choose for your burger. Other than that, this place is amazing and I look forward to seeing more Big Boys burger joints in the future."}
{"text":"The burger was made fresh, but didn't have great meat flavour and honestly it's a little big. We came on a day with a lot of snow so the service was good (we were the only people there initially).   Overall it's not a great burger, wouldn't come back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: typical hard core burger setting, everything on the menu looks absolutely amazing  Food : 1. regular burger with caramelized onions: 5/5 the burger was HUGE, and the onions were definitely worth the extra 75 cent.   2. Big boy poutine: half a pound of burger, loaded with gravy and cheese, huge huge portion.    Overall: ive been thinking about it everyday after. its that good. most definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Been there lots, but no more.  pricy pricy already and the kicker is now on their interact terminal it ask for a tip?????  Its a self serve place like Tim Horton's, why a tip if you have to clean up your own stuff and even take out is the same.  And.... the girl stands there watching you to see if you tip.   The tip for you is, you have no idea how many people won't come back because of this, it really is a pisser.  I know you will say there is an option for no tip, but your staff is watching your every move, so, the solution is we just don't come back, end of story.  Everyone in our company is telling everyone about it friends and family.  THINK BIG BOY.  Reply that you take this function out if you are a real businessman."}
{"text":"An old schooled burger joint often upstages a trendy gourmet burger joint on core competencies.  Big Boy's Burger is another proof.  I had a Big Boy's burger.  Fresh warm bun, big chunky moist patty, fresh toppings, large portion.  It was tasty and satisfying.  Every component was fresh and yummy.  We also had a poutine and some wings.  Poutine used good potatoes, and the gravy had lot of cheese.  It was just a tart too salty for my taste.  Wings had an crispy coat.  The honey garlic sauce was slightly spicy.  All were perfect comfort food.  Services is fast.  Friendly staffs are generous with the toppings. Overall 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good burger place. Burger was huge, cooked medium well, but not dry.  Could have used a little more seasoning.  Standard toppings as well as a few \"premium\" ones... Fries were real good, and you get plenty of them. Deep fried Mars bar?  I was tempted, but didn't try this time out.  Gives me a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing! I like how they make old school burgers! Fries are really good too! Staff is friendly, short wait time, always fresh!"}
{"text":"Classic burger, great of helping of fries, and a fountain drink for 12$. Getting every cent that you pay for."}
{"text":"Its a good burger and fries, the poutine is quite good. Only problem is the price, its a little more on the expensive side for a fast food kind of place. I had to pay almost 15$ for a combo. The price range is kind of unfair when compared to any other burger place which makes me go there much less even though its very close in proximity to me. Hopefully they lower the price or have some specials! If not I likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit or miss.... Sometimes your food comes out perfect or sometimes it comes out burnt and over cooked both fries and burger.  Same goes with the cashiers.... You either get the really nice one or the really miserable one. The miserable one has served me atleast 4 times now and she has yet to smile or be polite and if you don't order cheese or bacon on your burger your in for a dirty look lol customer service skills defiantly lacking.  There Greek salad always comes out perfect and there dressing is delicious. And if you don't like a crunchy bun defiantly ask for it not to be toasted or grilled or whatever they do to it. Tends to come out like a stale bun, Once they toast it. This burger would probably be like number 4 on my list of best burgers in richmondhill. Also have tried there Philly cheesesteak if you are a cheesesteak Regular eater this is probably not what ur going to expect. It's like s mix of cheese with a little bit of shredded meat and covered in BBQ sauce.  Not a traditional Philly :("}
{"text":"This place is the perfect spot to come for a quick bite with your family. You get SO much food!!!! Fries, burgers, chicken nuggets and Greek salad are only some of the amazing items. They are quick and the staff are SO polite. They'll make you anything you want.  This is so much better than other burger joints."}
{"text":"If you know what good meat tastes like, and want it in your burger, come to big boys! This place doesnt have your crappy wimpys/hero burger, with flimsy loose meat. When they promise an 8oz burger, you GET an 8oz burger. When you ask for some mix and match of ingredients that's not offered, they'll do it, no complaints.   By far the best burgers I've had in all of GTA, and I've tried quite a large number.  P.S. Try the big boy's poutine and replace the burger they put in it with their souvlaki, for when you're already eating a burger."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, but I found the burgers to be a bit too greasy and felt a bit gross afterwards.   I really wish they offered antibiotic free, hormone free meat.  I think I've been spoiled by hero burger which remains as one of my favourites.    However, the staff here are extremely nice.    Don't think I'll be going back, but others may have a different experience."}
{"text":"This place is a must try! Do not be fooled by it not looking busy whenever you drive by and not see anyone sitting in, I believe it because most people order to take out. So far everything I have tried here has been spot on. If you love Chip Truck fries like I do then this is the place to get them without having to travel down to the city. Everything is also very reasonably priced and the burgers ..... massive!"}
{"text":"Popped by this place on our way home. Got a back bacon and a regular burger to go. Extra egg on both. Buns are great, definitely an upgrade over something like a McDonald's. Burger patty wasn't bad, but back bacon tasted of smoke and... nothing else. Ketchup was a little bit too sour, definitely trying to save money on ingredients. All in all - great potential, however I suggest working on getting better ingredients even if it means making the dishes a dollar or two more."}
{"text":"We had a great meal from this place!  We've driven by so many times, it's a shame we hadn't tried this earlier. Walking in you think you want a burger but then you see they have Philly cheesesteak sandwiches, chicken wings, hot dogs and more.   We decided to order a couple of classic burgers and the chicken fingers and upgraded our fries to poutines. Note that you can upgrade you side or drink to anything on the sides menu. Poutine upgrade set us back only $1.85 or so and was well worth it.   Everything appeared to be made-to-order so expect to wait a few minutes, this isn't a fast food place but they are quite fast.   The burgers were really good, they had a nice grilled taste and the toppings were fresh and generous. The chicken fingers were really delicious and large. You only get three but they're massive, crispy and juicy on the inside. The poutines were really good, the fries are fresh cut, thick and crispy and they use real cheese curds and are really generous with them. The gravy was also delicious. The portion of fries was massive though, more than enough for two people to share, had we known this, we would have only done one poutine!  The prices are almost on par with fast food burger restaurants but the quality is much better. 1/4 or 1/2 pound burger combos are around $8-$10 and some change and come with a fries and a drink, extra cost for bacon, cheese, and other premium toppings.   The restaurant has a retro diner feel, almost like a truck stop or biker gang hangout, it's clean and family friendly, however not a lot or seating inside. It's likely more of a takeout place.   The service was good, you can tell the people working there actually enjoy it, one of the guys dressing our burgers was talking about how people come from as far as Toronto or Barrie to have their food so they're making a good name for themselves. It makes a difference in the taste of food when the person preparing it takes pride in what they do and I felt that at big boy. I feel fortunate to have this place so close to home!   The ingredients are fresh and I will be back to try the Philly cheesesteak or chicken burger next, the milkshakes looked good as well!"}
{"text":"Worth trying, I was surprised at first. It's nicer inside than outside, I've driven by many times without thinking this place was going to last(old coffee time joint before) but it's got a nice modern diner vibe inside, cool friendly staff!   The outside is ok but the plaza is a bit isolated and scenery of bayview/construction doesn't help a patio vibe, which is a few tables outside, nothing fancy.  Yelper review guided me to stop in as it's hard to find a good burger joint uptown. Fries are thick cut and nice crispy crunch that is true to chip trucks not from a coating but from the soaking and blanching process. My poutine was as expected, oozy cheesy and salty gravy goodness, decent price too.   Burgers both beef & vegetarian were awesome! Toppings are just the classic kind, nothing hipster here.   I won't hesitate to stop by here again, and bring friends."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with my hubbie and kids. From Chicken Souvlaki to Gyros to hotdogs - all deliciously awesome! Fresh and very flavourful. Great atmosphere too! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good. The burger I had was huge but a little overcooked. The poutine was bomb. But I came back for the Greek food, the gyro, and chicken on a bun. It was top notch and the taziki was cream and the bun was fresh and soft. Mm mm mm"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to hit this burger joint up for a while since I heard a lot of good things about it.   Needless to say it was everything I had ever dreamed about and possibly more.  Amazing burger, amazing fries, excellent service and staff is really friendly. Even the washrooms were clean! I'll be sure to return again.   Thanks a big boy burgers!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and got to say definitely 100 percent better than the burger chains. Great service  and great food! Definitely recommend this place ! :)"}
{"text":"Big Boy's Burger cooks when ordered. I love the smell of meat on grill but I always ended up smell like what I were eating.  Big Boy's Burger Combo($9.95) has 1/2 lb of meat and holy moly full tray of french fries! I almost want to tell the nice guy at the counter that I cannot really eat all of those by myself...   Come hungry! I did finish the burger which was juicy... but just lack a little seasoning. The toppings consists of the usual onion, tomato, lettuce (thinks Harvey) other toppings are 99 cents each: fried egg, sauteed mushroom, bacon. And the Fresh Cut Fries were really good!  Quite busy during lunch rush since it is located near a High School.  Big Boy's Burger serves more than burgers, so I will be back to try out other items when I have a craving for some meat!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and thick cut fries. I had a no bun with half pound burger and it was very tasty. Also offer Greek salad but would have been great if there was a caesar salad offered. Very polite and efficient service with very fresh toppings. Also would be good if there is a while wheat bun available but was still very delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"BBB is a classic diner style burger joint which is not easy to find anymore and good on them, they preserved the diner feel with great food at reasonable prices.  Drive up, park and you can smell the grill cooking up some meat before walking in the door.    (BTW...the check in deal for the Yelp Binge week is not accepted and is expired as it is outdated from June 21-27, 2015)    Seating is limited to a handful of booths with black seats which look worn and some metal round stools are lined up along the glass with a counter to eat on. All very old school resembling the 50's style era.  We ordered the Big Boy burger which is a whopping 1/2lb hunk of juicy beef served on a home style bun. The poutine served in a box with dark gravy and curd cheese (my fav) on fresh cut fries which remained firm.  Portion size is on the large side making it a good deal for the price. Overall, its dayymm good...Time to put on those big boy pants and give it a try."}
{"text":"Went here for burger binge week first stop. have been to a different branch before. To be honest I don't think it was this bad that I would've given it a two star.   Volume is there I have to admit especially since I got it fully loaded with the egg.   Presentation as to be expected wasn't there. Considering the decor I don't expect a perfect looking burger. I was expecting good tasting meat from the grill.   However, the meat in a word was really \"tasteless\".  I only really tasted the salt. There's no aroma to the burger.  I was full in the end but it really wasn't satisfying and I found it a waste of my daily caloric intake.   It's a very disappointing start to burger binge week."}
