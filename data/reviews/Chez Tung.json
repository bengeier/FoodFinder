{"text":"We stumbled upon Chez Tung after having stopped at 3 places and being highly disappointed after waiting at the 1st for 30 minutes and the wait was to be another 30 to 40 minutes, we finally stumbled upon this little gem of a place. The staff was really friendly as soon as we walked in. We got served right away. The food is absolutely delicious. Its not your typical asian reataurant that americanize everything. The prices are decent. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff! It's on a side street so a little hard to find, but once you find it you will be so glad that you did! 
It's a great place to go to for a quick lunch with colleagues, or a nice dinner with family and friends. I would definitely recommend the shrimp tempura, crispy noodle dishes and the soups! Yum!"}
{"text":"Every item I've ever had on the menu at Chez Tung has been excellent! Let's start with the soup. The Thai soup is my favorite. It's like shrimp, mushrooms and spice are having a party in your mouth. I've also had the Tonkin soup and asparagus and crab soup and those are awesome too. Now on to the rolls. The best imperial rolls I've ever had. Their spring rolls are equally delightful though. The main dishes are all great, but I usually have the Spicy Chicken with crispy noodles. So tasty!! I've had every other main dish on the menu as well and like I said, I've never been disappointed. Don't forget the fried banana at the end of the meal. It's such a great way to finish up. Happy eating!!"}
