{"text":"We have all passed by Caffe Trieste before it was open and always wonder what new retail franchise will be opening up.   What is Caffe Trieste you may ask? They are an international chain of four Italian-themed coffee houses plus one retail store which features traditional wood roasted coffee, beautiful food, and cold beverages. Originally founded in San Francisco, California, USA, Caffee Trieste is the first espresso house on the West Cost and the first in Canada.  To me Caffe Trieste is an upscale luxury version of Starbucks. Yes the two businesses are no where close to each other in the coffee world but one is more luxurious then the other.   When you first step into Caffe Trieste (or pass by it) the first thing you'll see is their menu on the left side of the store, read each individual item they have on their menu and you'll want to try it out. There is no coffee aroma, you won't smell like coffee unlike Starbucks and Tim Hortons, but the atmosphere gives you a luxury upscale vibe. The concept of the store is just like Starbucks and Second Cup where it starts off with the register followed by the barista station and an area on the end where you pick up your orders. Across from the barista station, Caffe Trieste has an open refrigerator concept in which you can grab cold beverages or cold desserts freely. They have tiramisu which is actually worth trying! From the pick up location, Caffe Trieste has an indoor patio like deck where you can find a table and a place to sit. It's the same area where the escalator are connecting the 3rd floor to the 4th floor.  Caffe Trieste has two sizes, regular and extra with the extra size being a quarter taller than the regular. Their drinks are amazing as if they have a rich flavour. Their food on the other hand is absolutely mouth watering. I had their Nutella filled croissant and it was actually warm, baked fresh, flakey and crisp.   Ever since they have open I became a regular instantly, I tend to visit Caffe Trieste at least 3-4 times a day. Although they don't have a reward program or loyalty like Second Cup and Starbucks, that won't stop me from coming back every single time!  I would strongly recommend Caffe Trieste if you want to try something new."}
{"text":"I had lemon cake and it was one of the best cakes I ever had; right moisture, a little too sweet for me, but the lemon flavor was done right. The espresso and vanilla latte were really good, well crafted and had a nice foam texture to it. It even comes with a chocolate, but the service could use more smile."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. The live band is unfortunately just way too loud -- acoustic instruments would be more appreciated. It's a coffee place-- people need to hear themselves talk."}
{"text":"Fresh and high quality sandwiches! The prices are reasonable as well. It's a good and quick lunch choice compare to the fast foods in the core"}
{"text":"cool coffee stop in td square, staff was super nice, I LOVED the giant menu by the door. Their organic chai is my favorite. Choose this over starbucks or second cup anytime."}
{"text":"I like to stop in at Cafe Trieste when I'm in the mall... pre/post-shopping is always good.  Pretty sure I had one of the best Americanos here... it was on a little tray and there was a little ceramic milk thing and a chocolate.... it was like mixing little potions!!  Friendly staff (a little formal, but I'd prefer that to too lax).  No complaints."}
{"text":"The latte was excellent - although not really hot enough. The panini was a small round loaf of bread stuffed with prosciutto and some arugula and may - way too much mayo by the way. I always thought panini's were toasted - oh well -that was my fault for not checking.  The service however was first class (very polite and professional).  The desserts look lovely and if the espresso is as flavorful as the latte - it's a definitely a wonderful euro coffee and desert stop!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Caffe Trieste while on my way to the parking lot under Holt Renfrew.  The sandwiches don't come with any sides, but they're quite hefty. I had the Italiano which came came on a soft ciabatta bun filled with a thick layer of Italian meats. The basil bruschetta and red pepper aioli spreads brought all the flavors together. For $11, I felt I got my money's worth.   The mochaccino was delicious and really hit the spot. I'm quite envious of those who work in downtown because Caffe Trieste is quite a delicious lunch option. I'd come back to Caffe Trieste again to try other items on their menu for sure."}
{"text":"I visited Caffe Trieste on my only day in Calgary while I was on a work trip from Los Angeles, and I was so glad I stumbled upon it. The owner took the time to help me order what he considered to be the better of the vegetarian sandwiches, and he was right! The sandwich was incredible as well as the chocolate chai. Additionally, the entire staff was friendly, and I wish I had been in Calgary another day to go back."}
{"text":"The coffee here is so bomb! I ordered a double shot mocha and it came out perfect, sweet and creamy ."}
