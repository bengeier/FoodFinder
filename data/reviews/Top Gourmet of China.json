{"text":"This restaurant is located in a really awkward location and you can easily miss it driving by. So as expected, it's typically pretty empty. My family has been here several times. I think my dad found this place only because of newspaper ad. We live under 1km away and we've never been here.  The most notable thing to me about this place is their unsustainably low prices on some of their menu options. If you order from their \"fancy\" menu it's pricier. But if you are Chinese, they have some combo/special menus. My family had the $88 combo which comes with lobster, peking duck 2 course, a soup, fried rice, and some other dishes. The value for $88 is ludicrous. Can easily feed 7-8 people. We also ordered from one of those paper a la carte menus and you can get decent portioned dishes for like $7-9.  You might be rightfully worried about the taste. Frankly like most Chinese restaurants, the menu options are extensive and the kitchen is bound to make some things better and some things worse. Their shrimp and spicy beef brisket (don't know English name) are excellent. Their lobster is average. Their peking duck is as good as any other place. Their \"dim sum\" dishes are generally sub par. So basically if you visit a few times, you know what to get and what to avoid.  Service is awful but I'm one of those people that primarily focus on food. I don't need to be pampered. Just fill my order accurately and let me spend time with my family.   Will come back again and again simply due to proximity to home and the amazing value."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. Horrendous service. The restaurant is 25% full and customers are getting their own plates, utensils, cups, tea, food. Its pretty much a self serve restaurant at this point. The servers are no where to be found. The food is tasteless. Don't come here and waste your time. This place is a joke."}

{"text":"Big restaurant with modern fixtures inside. Clean washrooms. New management!!!!  Ordered: Peking duck, $38. Tofu dish, $10. Noodles with eggplant, $10.  They have an AYCE Xin Jiang Bbq for $15.99/person.  Service was prompt; there were 4 tables plus us.  Peking duck was Beijing-style, not Cantonese-style:  no red colour on the duck!  Taste was similar to Dayali or Peking Duck Kitchen.  The noodles were very good; better than the one I ate at Shanghai Dimsum.  Tofu was just ok.  The restaurant, I would say, is under-appreciated.  It may be suffering from the bad reviews from its previous management (slow service/food taking long to come).  We will go again. Family dinners will be perfect here since it is quite big and their prices are reasonable."}
