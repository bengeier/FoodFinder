{"text":"I have been to Quigley's many times before and found the service to be consistant and the food was of good value. We moved away from the area for a few years and now that we are back we decided to check it out again. The brunch was good and friends raved about the ultimate eggs. The pear salad was also good and was large enough for a meal. What I have to complain about is their credit/debit machine. Of the four times I have been there since February, the systems weren't working. We had to use the in house cash machine, with charges, it added an additional $3.75 to the bilI. I will have to remember to take cash next time."}
{"text":"You aren't going to get cheated on anything at Quigley's. Great value for food, decent taps. There are very knowledgeable servers there, but on our last visit, we got a rookie. Nothing bad, just some awkwardness.  I also have had issues with the credit card/debit machine, and was not notifies ahead of time. It was like it came as a surprise to the staff, although it's happened 3 times to me."}
{"text":"Generally a bit of a sports bar feel, but the food is a big gourmet surprise.  Try the eggplant parmesan and reconsider becoming a vegetarian.  Lots of local brews on tap and if the expansive patio is open, it's great for people watching in the famous Beaches area."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here last time I was in town and I was back again this time.  A typical Irish pub, which I happen to like, and a good atmosphere, we sat inside, although you can choose to sit on the patio outside.  The food was good and the beer was cold.  It is clearly a neighborhood locals spot, and everyone was very friendly.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"The patio is definitely a key draw for this bar/restaurant.  It looks like you could fit about 50 people out there to enjoy a decent menu under trees that are almost Endor-size when you are under them at your seat.  The selection of beers and the price are both reasonable, which makes spending an afternoon or evening that much more relaxing.    The servers are friendly, and on Saturday nights they bring in a live band, which really rounds out the fun, \"great little watering hole from a movie\" kind of feeling.  Just a great spot to sit back and watch all the Beachers walk their children, dogs, themselves, each other ...  Will be a killer spot for the Jazz Fest, too!"}
{"text":"Quigley's has good brunch and a great waitress.  Great vibes all around.  The food was good, the Bloody Mary was good and I would love to come back in the summer and spend some quality time on their patio.  The best: - the waitress.  She was super friendly and super awesome.  Top notch staff and top notch service.  The good: - The hashbrowns here were very good.  They were in the style of THE Lancer but without the amazing spice.  They were very salty and had their own spice on them which had a kick.  They were also mixed with flecks of green onions.  All around very good hashbrowns, but definitely needed ketchup. - My bloody Mary was SPICY!  But that's how I like it!  - Big portions and decent coffee - Great ambiance and I had a really good time hanging out here  The Bad: - The bacon was kinda shady.  It was floppy and super greasy and I kind of wonder if they had deep fried it.  That is a pet peeve of mine - bacon should never get deep fried.  I'm not saying for sure that that's what happened, but something was not right at all.  I would order Canadian bacon next time. - Not much parking around here.  Would I return here? For sure.  I look forward to it.  I hope my waitress is working."}
{"text":"While they have a very nice patio, we chose to sit inside.  The music was at just the right volume for the dinner.  Food was pretty good and portions were massive.  At first I thought it was odd that when bread was brought to the table there were only two buns for me and the other person I was with.    Normally you'd expect a basket.  But when the food arrived so quickly afterwards, and because of the large portion sizes, I realized it didn't really make sense to offer a cavalcade of breads that you wouldn't have room for, or have time to eat.    As an added bonus (and probably the most important point to most people), they weren't stingy on the alcohol when it came to mixed drinks.  The main complaint I had was there was some confusion with the menus.  We received two different menus that had different menu items and prices and both were still different than the menu posted by their door.  They really need to make sure they are all updated.  If I was someone else, I could have complained and got my dinner for a few dollars cheaper than the current price due to the inconsistancies."}
{"text":"I'd award four stars to Quigley's just for playing the GOOD version of Soft Cell's \"Tainted Love\" - the extended version that outros with a cover of The Supremes' \"Where Did Our Love Go\". But thankfully, the food and service were equally four star-worthy.  Quigley's is sort of pub-ish and has a huge patio that, from the looks of it, is usually full of Beaches locals. Inside we had our choice of seats in the massive dining area - I'd say it can hold no fewer than a hundred people. Absolutely huge. This would be a dynamite place for a large group or special event.  The menu is substantial and has an intriguing mix of Italian and Asian inspired dishes - several pizzas, pad thai, burgers, club sandwiches, baby spinach, blue cheese and pear salad. Most things can be vegetarianized and our knowledgeable server was eager to help break down the best veg choices for me.   I commented to my dining partner that my homemade four cheese with tomatoes and basil ($11) tasted a lot like Delissio. But really, what's wrong with Delissio? After all, it tastes like delivery, right? I weakly finished only a quarter of my pizza before tapping out and asking to have it boxed. Imagine my surprise when my pizza came back to me packaged up in an actual pizza box. Legit!"}
