{"text":"Pizza is okay NOT THE BEST ..very rude ppl asked for a slice ..they didnt have a slice i had to buy a whole pizza..should consider taking the slices of the menu it happend one time now a second time!! Will never go bak here again!!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely average or slightly below.  Our pizza was fairly bland.  Nothing special at all.  Instead of regular pepperoni or small balls of sausage, we got  actual  paper thin FLAKES of them.  Even these flakes had little meat flavor  Won't be back and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"It's good pizza and wings usually pretty quiet has a few TV's. Prices are good owners are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best place in AZ for pizza and wings! Clean chill environment. Best part is that Mario actually makes your pizza. It's always good all the time. I gave them 4 stars because they don't use a water filter in there soda machines. The water makes the drinks taste like flavored city water. When they get filtered drinks I'll come back and give them the extra star. As I said. Very very good pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Out of town from LA, fresh ingredients great pizza and cheesy bread and the ranch sauce was good"}
{"text":"for years this was my favorite pizza place.. in the last year it went down hill.. still good just wasnt what it use to be... i remember walking in here at anytime and they use to jump up and yell almost in excitement...i took a break for a few months then walked in here not knowing a single person.. i was ok with that because the new people are just as nice... just doesnt feel the same and the pizza isnt the same..."}
{"text":"The only redeeming value is the friendly staff.  If you are looking for a great value on pizza and wings it is not here.  The wings are very small and not of good flavor.  The pizza tastes like cardboard.  If anyone is searching for good wings and pizza I would recommend US Pizza."}
{"text":"I live near here and have come around a few times for dinner. Overall, the pizza quality is great! Really great tasting pizza here in that New York style. The wings are decent, but aren't anything to brag about. However, no complaints there.   The inside of the restaurant is in need of a makeover. The inside has that \"run down\" feeling to it. Some of the chairs and tables need replaced/fixed. Additionally, the people at the counter aren't exactly the nicest. Every time I've been here, it's usually, \"What can I get you?\" I can't say I have ever made small talk with the counter help, which is rare given my outgoing nature. This usually leads to that awkward meal where you and a few friends eat, but feel uneasy about staying in the restaurant.   All-in-all: The food is great and is what will make you return; the price is above average (think Papa John's pricing); and the counter help could use a personality change."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings. I would highly recommend it to anybody. The staff there is also very nice. It's very clean in there with a lot of TVs around and they have a lot on the menu."}
{"text":"Super watered down wing sauce leaves it with no taste. Asked for extra sauce on pizza didn't get it. Other than those issues pizza is ok."}
{"text":"Pizza is my MOST favorite fast food. Yeah, I know that I should not boast, but, if you want an honest review of this genre, read on! My love of pizza began in Astoria, NY at the foot of the Tri-Borough Bridge when I discovered this tasty treat at The Pine Tree Tavern.( at the tender age of FOUR ! ). Yes, fellow dough-boys and girls, the romance started at this moment of first bite. Through the years in NYC, and later Chicago (boy did I think their pizza was WEIRD with cracker crust or thick enough to bust a gut and tomato sauce on TOP to boot ?) I learned and embraced the diversity of regional delights!  I STILL favor the thin, chewy, crisp crust of NY style pizza ! You want it ? You have it right in the Surprise/ El Mirage area ! Updated on 4//12012 I still go here regularly and it's still EXCELLENT! Couldn't believe that they took my great review down because it was questionable???  Original Review  After relocating to Surprise 4 years ago, my quest to locate my 'pie of choice' began. I tried 'Streets Of NY' ( a step above soggy Dominos); 'NYPD' (OK in a pinch); 'Rosati's' ( not bad Chicago thin or thick but too $$ for what you get); Barros, Pizza Hut, Dominos, (in the same league as Costco.....Ech!); I then discovered 'Lucky's' and 'Famous Ray's' much, much better! Our area began to sprout new businesses and I discovered MARIO's hidden behind the El Mirage WAL-MART at the intersection of  W Waddell/Thunderbird and Dysart.  I have been on board at MARIO's literally since day ONE and continue to follow the trail of pizza crumbs back to their lair at least weekly. This is a family operated business and they make you feel at home. This is one of the ways that it sets itself apart from other pizza places. The atmosphere is basic with Phoenix sports decor with 4 flat screens and the counter to order. Plenty of tables are available with pleasant a family service staff to take your orders table-side. The food is the real STAR !! NY thin crust PIZZA with the right balance of crispy, CHEWY goodness.  Pseudo Pizza snobs need not apply, there are no caramelized anythings, not a marinated trendy veggie in sight!!! No sun-dried SQUAT!..... Only excellent crust, tasty sauce, real cheese and all the traditional toppings in perfect balance Their other offerings,  the hero sandwiches, hot dinner plates, pastas are basic QUALITY pizzeria fare. They offer draft and bottled beer, and soft drinks. WINGs were never my thing. The guests who sampled them in my presence were quite satisfied. OH! Their Sicilian PIZZA is also EXEMPLARY !  Treat the family VISIT MARIO's, I gar-on-tee you'll satisfy your NYC Pizza 'Jones'."}
{"text":"I love love love Mario's! I've only ever had pizza and wings (and beer of course) but delivery or dine in, it's great! The crust on the pizza is perfect and they have great deals, too.  The owner (Mario) is pretty much always there and he's a nice, friendly guy.  I would have given 5 stars, but last time we ordered wings they were TINY! I was super disappointed because I love their wings so much and usually they are a pretty good size. All in all, this is my favorite pizza place. Forget Pizza Hut and Dominos!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something good to eat with reasonable delivery times look els where. So I placed an order a few weeks ago, it took a while for just a gyro & pasta anyway left a good tip, open everything up & the gyro meat was so dry it must have been sitting out for hours, the cucumber sauce was terrible. It was almost like they just put scraps of cucumbers in sour cream. The pasta was poorly prepared, in a layer of oil. Called back right away, Was assured I'd have a credit under my phone number. So I let it go, tossed the food for the dogs & made something. Went to give it another shot today, turns out my credit was never put in to the system. The gentleman on the phone did however offer a credit anyway but after remembering what I got last time & that my credit was neglected I had to turn down the offer. Will never order for this business again unless it is under new management."}
{"text":"I don't write a whole lot of reviews, but we eat Mario's on a regular basis and love it.  We moved close by about a year ago, but have been eating at Mario's since my husband started working nearby about 3 years ago.  The pizza is delicious, though we've never had the wings.  The lasagna is fantastic when I'm not craving pizza.  They serve their pizza by the slice which made it a favorite lunch hour spot for my husband. After they started delivering, we started ordering at least 2-3 times a month! Love this place.  Great service, fast delivery (though we do live less than 2 miles away), and great food!!"}
{"text":"We had pepperoni/sausage pizza and fried mushrooms. Pizza was good, toppings were sufficiently dispersed. Mushrooms were great although I personally prefer horseradish sauce to ranch as a dipping sauce. Lady behind the counter was very nice and patient with us while we decided what we wanted."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad. Ordered wings they were rancid tasting. One bite and we through them away. They tasted was so bad I spit it out and had to brush my teeth. Also got an Italian hoagie, low quality meats, bland dressing. Will never go back., save yourself a major disappointment, much better places to eat in the Burg."}
{"text":"This place is near my home and my wife liked it so we continued ordering from here despite my dissatisfaction. No longer though. My wife felt ill after her latest order, chicken salad, so fortunately I will no longer be forced to order from here.  While previously there have been no issues with the food I have experienced numerous service issues. One time I was provided with the wrong order and did not realize it till I arrived home after picking it up. The ticket included with the order was correct and I did not want to open everything since it was stapled in the bag.  This isn't the worst thing in the world. They were clearly busy and stuff happens. The next time I returned they charged me $10.00 though because the wrong order I received cost more than my order and they indicated I should have notified them my order was incorrect.  They are also consistently off on their pick up times. I generally end up standing around for 10 minutes waiting for my order even though I generally arrive 5 - 10 minutes after the expected wait time since it became clear there was no way the food would be ready in that window.  My review is 2 stars instead of 1 because their stromboli is delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings and salad. Very impressed and the owners and staff were exceptional."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  I think the sauce is excellent. Definitely get cravings for this place frequently."}
{"text":"So last night I ordered pizza and broke my tooth. I called the restaurant and the owner  told me that if he paid for everyone's dental that made complaints he would be out of business. He told me he would believe it if I had ordered a Marios special. The owner doesn't even offer to replace my pizza or ask if he can help in anyway. Not that I wanted a new pizza at this point. So I write a bad review on Facebook, and he has the nerve to call the police to ask me to remove my review. I went to the dentist and had it fixed immediately but really wtf is wrong with people. Don't eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza and they give you pretty good size portions for what you pay for the wings are also real good and we order from them all the time"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza, the atmosphere, and the staff were extremely friendly. We will definitely make this our family spit for pizza"}
{"text":"Everything we've had is great!  The pizza, the subs, the pasta and salads. Oh yeah, wings too! Clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"It's ok nothing special like every other place In surprise lucky pizza and Ray pizza just ok make sure to order your wings and pizza well done"}
{"text":"My families Favorite Pizza place.  We are from NY and struggled to find a NY Style pizza we liked as much as the ones we got at home.  Others in the area aren't bad.....but not as close as we liked.  We discovered Mario's 10 years ago and have been there at least once a week ever since.  Prices are great, pizza is excellent and if you want some sandwiches/subs or other things like Calzones, Pasta dishes, etc...they have them too.  I love the WINGS.....simple and effective.  Just like home!    Adrian and Destiny are wonderful at the front counter and \"Dad\" in the back is always cooking away!      Did I mention the beer is ICE COLD.......Try the garlic pizza too!   It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Again, I gotta hype the (good) local shops and this is as local as it gets as it's within biking distance. I started coming into Mario's right after they opened and haven't been disappointed yet. Whether you order a whole pie or by the slice, their pizza kicks ass. Like most pizzerias, they give you more bang for your buck and are usually cheaper than most places that deliver. Every time I've been there, Mario is behind the counter and always greets me. I get the feeling that members of his family work there as well including his wife.  Bottom line: Mario's is my first choice for pizza because of quality, price, location, and the people who run it."}
{"text":"We are from out of time and needed a pizza place that delivered. The pizza was great (I'm from NJ and this pizza is almost as good as home). Delivery was fast and our order was correct. Reasonably priced and great food."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place my family has been ordering there for over 5 years. However,  the current management is rude, the pizzas are late, the orders are wrong, I ordered my usual 2 large cheese pizza special and and hour and 45 minutes later our pizzas showed up... but they were the wrong pizzas we almost got charged double and I was told were would get a credit for our wait and the inconvenience, called to get my credit and the manager who remembered the incident said our credit was the pizzas we were originally supposed to get.  Meanwhile she's extremely rude, and I said if your going to be rude and not give us our credit your going to loose a longtime regular customer, and she said \"ok, that's fine\".  I will never order from that rude and unorganized place again, I will support other local pizza places in the area now."}
{"text":"Of course, when we are leaving the state we find the best pizza ever! We ordered an extra large cheese pizza and twenty hot wings and all arrived on time and the best we've had in a very long time! The pie was huge and i could actually fold the slices just like being back on the east coast! The wings were fried perfectly and the sauce was awesome!!  Prices were very reasonable and I now wish we were staying in AZ just for this place! Haha"}
{"text":"Quick service, great prices, yummy food!"}
{"text":"We ate at Mario's for lunch and loved it!! We had a large cheese pizza with black olives and an order of wings, YUMMY. We are so glad we finally gave this pizza place a try. We wont order pizza anywhere, but at Marios. The pizza was hot and fresh,the crust perfect. The wings were good too. Cant wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"for a few yrs this place was a staple for ny pizza in the far west side area, but in the last yr, wow a change for the worse, workers seem to be stand off ish, pizza although ny stlye  has been getting dry , toppings suspected of being canned. Ill avoid this place for a while and drive past for some good greasy ny pizza elsewhere, they on probation with me  LOL"}
{"text":"Only getting 3 stars because the food is always good. On several occasions I have waited an hour and a half for SALAD. I don't understand why it takes this long. Right now going on 2 hours for steak salad and bread sticks."}
{"text":"Mario's is walking distance from my house so from time to time we go there and get a slice. The pizza is really outstanding New York style. We usually get the fried zucchini which is fresh and very tasty. We also have gotten wings before they are very good. I love Mario's because it's a local restaurant that's privately owned. The owner is always very nice and takes care of us every time we go. Highly recommend Mario's if you're in the area it is an El Mirage secret gem."}
{"text":"Decent pizza.  Not my favorite, but we order it every once in a while. The staff is very friendly though, so that kicks it up to 4-stars."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium sausage, green pepper and onion pizza for delivery. When it arrived, the pizza was lukewarm and the vegetables were actually cold like they were in the refrigerator. The pizza crust was delicious, but the sausage was very thin and flavorless. There was not enough cheese and sauce. The overall price was reasonable (no delivery charge) but I will not order again."}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to try a new pizza place and we picked Mario's. There were a couple of reasons why I'm not giving this place 5 stars. 1. When I went to order, the women taking my order did not speak English very well and had a really difficult time understanding me. Eventually she gave the phone to someone else who could understand me. 2. I ordered a white pizza and did not get a white pizza. Where I'm from, white pizza means there is no red sauce on the pizza. This one was a cheese pizza with red sauce which is not what I ordered. They did redeem themselves though by delivering my pizza in about 20 mins. The gentleman on the phone told me 45 mins but from the time I ordered to the time it showed up at my door was roughly 20 mins. Although I did not get my white pizza, all the pizza we ordered was really good and I have no complaints about the taste or look of my food. I will definitely be ordering from Mario's again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner so maybe I'm used to a different kind of pizza.  I use Yelp almost exclusively to decide on the fly what to order and more importantly where to order when I'm out of town, so there is an element of trust that I've grown used to .  I was visiting relatives in the El Mirage area and they live here 2-3 months out of the year and they said Mario's was good based on word of mouth from their friends. Seemed like a slam dunk to phone in an order, pick it up and be grubbing shortly thereafter.  Service was great during pickup. The pizzas was some of the worst we've had when we got home. There was no delay in eating them. The pizzas lacked proper amounts of toppings, had limp crust and generally didn't look good.  I usually leave good reviews on Yelp as I'd rather say good then bad but this pizza just isn't recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza an hour and a half ago, and I dont have it yet. I better not get charged. I ordered through GrubHub, and they (Mario's) said that it would take longer than expected. However, the sketchy part was that it was well past their posted closing time.  ***Update*** I did get charged for the pizza and did not even receive it. What a waste."}
{"text":"New favorite pizza place! We got the pizza and wing special with pepperoni pizza and it was amazing. Crunchy chewy crust, perfect amount of sauce and the topping were amazing. The wing were very good to. Definitely will order again and will recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite mom and pop pizza place in the Surprise area so far.  We ordered 2 large pepperoni pizzas and a antipasto salad.  Both were very good.  Nice thin crust, and the ranch was very good.  Didn't taste like it came from a bottle.  They charge extra for extra cups of ranch.  FYI.   But seems that most places do anymore."}
{"text":"Their staff was friendly, the food was great, our order was correct, reasonably priced and delivery was quick. We will order again."}
{"text":"I'm from NY, Mario is from NY. Pizza is really good but this weekend when I went with my family I decided to change it up and ordered a hot chicken parm hero. It took me back man, circa 1987 in Manhattan working a late night. One of the best pizza joints in the Phoenix area.   If you don't like them, eh, go somewhere else. LOL."}
{"text":"Checked Yelp for highly rated restaurants and Mario's caught my eye. We went in for dinner with my dad and ordered a greek salad, and 1/2 & 1/2 of cheese and combo pizza. The cheese pizza was pretty good, but I didn't care for the combo too much. The salad was average. We also ordered 20 buffalo wings which I scarfed down; they were pretty good.  I wouldn't say it was service with a smile. Before I went back I'd try the other pizza joints in the area."}
{"text":"Great pizza and more!  Pizza base is just right (a nice balance btw thin & medium)  toppings generous, good sauce.  Hoagies very good.  Good &  fast delivery. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I 'v heard lots of good things about this place, so last night I put it to the test , a friend from New Jersey was over, and I felt he would be  the best judge of the pie. Ordered a large special, New York Style, we both agreed it was phenomenal.The Pizza arrived in 30 minutes and it was hot and perfectly cooked. I also ordered a large side salad and and large antipasti salad. They were enormous and and antipasti could of been a meal within its self.The prices were every good, and the delivery person, and the gentleman who took the order were very polite."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and we looked up the highest rated pizza place near us to get a pizza delivered. This was a terrible idea. The pizza got here quickly but that is the last good thing I can say. We got the Mario's House Pizza but were really disappointed by the toppings. The crust is nice but canned mushrooms? That is nasty! The sausage is shaved so thin you can see through it and the sauce is just bland as can be. I have only thrown out one pizza in my life until this. Now it's two. If this is the best pizza around then we may be in trouble.  The fried zucchini was pretty good I have to say. Not much of a meal after a long day of moving but it's always nice to end a review with something nice to say."}
{"text":"Amazing wings and pizza! Pitchers of beer ice cold! Staff was friendly and welcoming! Too hot in there though but still fabulous!"}
{"text":"Got a pizza and a buffalo chicken wedgie delivered.  They were both amazing. Look forward to visiting Pittsburgh again and ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. It's flavorful with a crisp crust. The staff is friendly and service is fast. I also love the hot sandwiches. Prices are decent and they deliver too!"}
{"text":"Just had pizza and wings...excellent for both...delivered hot and quick on a friday night...we will be ordering from there again"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I just moved to the Surprise area and I've been trying different local pizza places.  This one is by far my favorite. I've had several different pizzas that I loved.  Huge slices and thin,  chewy crust. The fried mushrooms are delicious!!! My only criticism is that they put the ranch container in with the mushrooms so it's completely hot lol. Pizza and appetizers are usually so hot that I have plenty of time to cool the ranch down before eating. Seriously,  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have pretty high expectations for pizza delivery these guys are definitely up there with the best of them in the surprise area. If you even think of ordering from Domino's Pizza Hut or Papa John's over Mario's just slap yourself!"}
{"text":"Great service very friendly.  Pizza was big & super hot. We waited for it to go & decided to eat a slice before we left. The staff was nice enough to bring us plates. Crust was tasty & crispy which I didn't expect but I love. Place is roomy & tables are far enough apart. Tvs are nice. So far I'm pleased & planning to return"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza again and again perfection.One of my kids actually fought over the last piece for school,I lost.The cheese is awesome ,crust,perfect,great job guys."}
{"text":"I am frm cali but have a vaca home in surprise for spring training. I was one of Mario's first customers. not only is it the \"best pizza\" I ever ate? I don't even eat pizza in Cali anymore because \"nothing\" compares to his pizza. the greasy pepperoni is bomb and iIalways order my wings x-tra crispy & extra spicy. He even holds a bottle of habanero sauce just for us when we come into town to spice up our wings. His tap beer is kicked up cold glasses always frozen and I can watch any sports channel I want! his kind presence along with his wife & brother Aldo & his wife make it a pleasure each time we roll into town! I def. give them 2 thumbs up and 5 stars. If you say otherwise you just don't know a good pizza when you've had one. All our family & friends look forward to it during spring training. If we are there a wk we eat there at least 4 times. Mario's is bombay!!! Best pizza anywhere!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My pizza was really good didn't need anything extra. The sauce was good on my hot wings but the chicken tastes funny I'm not sure why. They forgot my napkins and plates but that was okay it didn't bother me. I would order again but I would appreciate if they would give me napkins next time. Customer service was good on the phone as well"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Literally trying to stomach this food right now and even the pizza tastes like old grease. Food came cold. Only reason I ordered from here was because GrubHub has a 5/5 rating for it. Food is repulsive. Service was late. \"Orange soda\" was really Mountain Dew.. Cinnamon sticks were just breadsticks with cinnamon. Mild hot wings were in a pool of grease with two splashes of hot sauce. GROSS. I'm gonna have a heart attack"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Nothing special about this place except the prices and free delivery. Ordered the medium cheese pizza and 10 hot wings for $16.95. Pizza was bland and the wings were basic. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mario's is under NEW Ownership! Always friendly and accommodating to all his customers. Fast and prompt delivery service as well, always with a smile. The Pizza's are great, from the simple Cheese Pizza to the Works!  I and the family LOVE the in house made, Ranch Dressing, they really need to bottle and sell that stuff can never get enough !. The Caesar Salad is Wonderful, large and very tasty. I like the Italian Hoagies & Meatball Hoagies. My son always orders the Gyro and loves it. This is a must try for those living in the South Hills or anyone willing to travel for a great pizza & hoagie at a great price. The menu is huge with plenty to please any family member. Keep up the good work guys !!!!"}
{"text":"Wanna get that NY feeling with awesome pie & sandwiches on the west side....drop in at Mario's!! Good atmosphere and very relaxing, plenty of beers and even some cheesecake!"}
{"text":"as local pizza goes this place kicks the pants off of chain pizza places.  yea the decor is dated and the place doesn't impress visually, but last i checked pizza should taste good!  i love their crust, their sauce, their cheese, and the way their pizza reminds me of east coast yumminess!    the staff isn't the chattiest staff, but they make your food fast and bring it to your table.  they are polite and that's all that matters to me.  i don't want chit chat.  i want to stuff my face with your greasy delicious pizza!  the pizza is so good my 13 yr old will actually offer to buy the whole family dinner with his saved money if i take them to marios.  when a 13 yr old will part with cash just so he can eat pizza you know it's good!  the wings are decent, the pizza is great with generous toppings, and the sandwiches are yummy too.  the kids love the french fries, but i don't think you can mess up fries :P"}
{"text":"Delivery was quick and the pizza was hot.That's about all I can say. We ordered a medium Hawaiian with bacon and a pepperoni Sicilian. Everything about the pizza tasted canned and unseasoned. The sauce left a bad aftertaste in my mouth and the Sicilian pizza sauce had lots of tomato chunks in it (per the person who ate it). It was also pretty expensive for what I ordered ($33.64). I won't be ordering pizza from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Really I love this Mario special pizza , one of my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh I ordered almost 30 times thanks guys you are doing great job"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Mario's a few times and their food is actually pretty good. But after our last experience there we will not be ordering from there again. First off they got our order wrong and gave us the wrong hoagie and did not give us the dressing on the side as we requested.  We contacted  the shop and explained to them that the order was wrong.  I was told by the manager that they would deliver the correct hoagie to our house.  After waiting an hour they finally delivered the second sandwich. The delivery guy asked for the first hoagie back after I had eaten half of it.  Within 15 minutes I received a call from the manager asking why I gave him a half eaten hoagie back and that we were supposed to be swapping out hoagies.  The manager was very rude and actually hung up on me. We were never told my the manager that we were swapping out hoagies.  I would be leary of ordering anything from this place, since they asked for the hoagie back, were they going to resell it????? The customer service was horrible and on both orders I never received my dressing, the manager's answer \"Never order from us again then\", my response was if you are a new company trying to start a business you will never succeed if you treat all your customers like us.."}
{"text":"Mario's is by far the best pizza in Surprise maybe even the valley. It's absolutely delicious.. 5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"They have really good pizza. We usually only do delivery and the wings are really good too but smaller than average in size so don't be shocked. They usually always deliver on time and they have even taken special request for food in specific ways the heart pizza is great for anniversaries. If they get their wing game on point they will be on my top 3 of best authentic pizza in town."}
{"text":"There pizza is very delicious but there delivery is not the best. We waited over an hour and the pizza was cold. They called us 3 times for our address and we live right down the street. I would go there again though since the food was very good just next time maybe go pick it up."}
{"text":"I love supporting the locals. Mario is always behind the counter and when I walk in to pick up my pie he walks over and shakes my hand.   They appreciate the business and support. they know that there success depends on the community.   The food is great. the pizza is always hot and fresh. The crust is thin and flavorful. My wife and I usually get the pizza wing deal with 1/2 pep, 1/2 sausage, & onions on the whole thing. The onions are fresh, the sausage is cooked and sliced in house and the pepperoni is full of flavor and greasy. I don't know about you but I like a greasy pepperoni pizza. :) Now that's comfort food.   I have also had there hot Italian sub and it did not disappoint. Fresh meat, melted cheese, oil and vinegar. Tasty.   I highly recommend that you stop on in and try some of there great food.   My wife and I eat a lot of pizza. I mean a lot. Some times as much as three or four pies a week. It's not because we don't know how to cook, it is just simply our favorite food on the planet, next to Sushi. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mario's Spinach and Feta pizza and their Mediterranean Hoagie!  They typically deliver within 45 minutes to an hour."}
{"text":"I love Mario's Pizza! I come here once a week or once every two weeks and have not been disappointed. Super nice guys, fast service, and great food. Favorite pizza place out there. By far."}
{"text":"They deliver, so I had to give 'em a try :)  It was actually difficult finding their on-line menu or website, so I called them to ask for it. (http://mariospizzeria.weebly.com)  They don't have small pizzas, but they do sell pizza by the slice. I ordered a medium Hawaiian pizza & a small order of hot wings.  The pizza was ok. The wings were small, but they were decent. Neither was anything I could really rave about.   The delivery time was 1 1/2 hours. They did tell me ahead of time that they couldn't get it to me before then. I agreed because I wanted to see if it was all that & a bag of chips. Not all that & no chips :("}
{"text":"We avoided this place, for the first few months after it opened, just because it is hard to make a left out of the plaza that it sits in. Mistake! I really like the NY style pizza (by NY style, I mean crust is neither really thin nor really thick, really tasty sauce use sparingly, and lots of cheese), and just love their wings - nice and vinegary, with as much heat as I want or don't want. The service is always pretty fast, the restaurant is spanking clean, and there are big, flat panels hung around the place... and there's always a game on. They were running good pitcher specials, whenever the Suns played. I've not had their Sicilian style, sandwiches or pasta dishes, but from watching other patrons enjoy them, they must be good!   The most expensive item is NY style steak pizza or a specialty Sicilian, around $18, and a pitcher of beer is about $7-8. Wings run about $6 (10 piece) to $15 (30), and they do have an everyday special - the usual large pizza and 20 wings for under $20.   I recommend this place, for the locals. Time to dump Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's... this is a local business that is worth supporting!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not gonna lie.  Got a marios special medium and jalapeño poppers.  Jalapeño poppers are delicious.   Pizza was mediocre but very well priced."}
{"text":"I us to love this place. I loved their pizza. We would order from them all the time. We would order over the phone we never ate at the place. One day we decided to stay and order. I never realize how rude the lady is at Mario's pizza. They had me waiting over 45 minutes for my pizza. All because they gave my order away. When I asked about my pizza the lady gave me so much attitude. Don't really want to go into details but I cant believe I have been giving these people business for many years. Yes there pizza is good but I don't think it's okay to talk or treat people like they do. I guess it's because they are the owners and they don't care if they lose one customer. I will never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but not worthy of the high praise it get's here.  As a self proclaimed pizza connoisseur, owner and operator of several pizza places, I'd have to say that it is above average and good but in no way reminds me of NY style.  We ordered their version of a Supreme pizza and wings.  The pizza had a lot of water on it which is usually a sign that the vegetables are fresh but the mushrooms tasted like they were 100% from a can.  All in all it was good pizza but not 5 star NY style as I was kind of hoping for after reading what other Yelpers said.  The wings were very good but tasted a little less than fresh.  If they changed mushrooms, and the wings were a bit fresher 4 stars would be a possibility"}
{"text":"Been here before, my kids and wife enjoy the place. Ordered to go tonight. Large pizza and wing combo and without fail Mario's came through. Pizza is great, wings a little on the small size. Good deal overall and pizza is delicious. Also fried mushrooms have no flavor, take water and deep fry it. BOOM = Mario's mushrooms. Not bashing the place, just some things don't belong at a pizza joint."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing here. The family that owns the business and all employees are so nice, and very accommodating.  In the last year the pizza has gotten even better than ever, the crust is not too thin, but with a delicious crunch, the cheese blend has been mastered and the sauce is out of this world.  You cannot find better pizza on the west side."}
{"text":"Marios is by far the best NY style anywhere in the area. The owner is always there and there quality is always spot on and consistent. If it's not ask to speak to the owner. I guarantee they will make it right. This is Mom and Pop and if you like pizza and not from a chain then check out Marrios. I am extremely picky when it comes to pizza. Only legit NY style with whole milk mozzarella and fresh dough."}
{"text":"Got delivery, 2 large pizzas and 2 orders of wings. Took second bite out of the extra cheese slice and a long hair was baked right into the cheese, GROSS! I then call them to complain and they kept me on hold for 10 mins, not to mention the girl who answered was very rude and tried to make me sound like a lier! Really!?? Like I don't have better things to do with my time. Owner then gets on the phone and tells me this is impossible. Just Wow!!!! I know things like this can happen but at least just own up to it apologize and offer me a refund. I had to tell them I wanted my money back just for the 1 pizza. They finally agreed then about an hour later send the delivery guy back with a new pizza. Thanks but no thanks, my appetite was already lost at that point! I will do my pizza business at Luckys pizza from now on!"}
{"text":"Top notch NY style pizza.   One of the best in El Mirage / Surprise.  I'm alway greeted with a smile when I order my pie. The wings are ok, but could be better.  I also can say this is one of the cleanest places you can eat!  Please give these guys a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This place takes me back to the east coast by far the best thin NY style pizza I've had in Surprise. The owners are great people and always welcoming."}
{"text":"Mario's pizza used to be my favorite pizza restaurant in Surprise, but lately something has changed.  The quality has gone way down along with their customer service.  The last few times we have ordered delivery, we requested the pizza to be cooked a little longer so it would be more crispy rather than soggy, but all we get is an undercooked soggy pizza that you have to eat with a fork.  In addition, we requested our wings to be extra crispy with very little sauce.  What we get is undercooked wings drenched in wing sauce.  It seems as though they are doing the opposite of what we want.  They make it however they want and you have to deal with it, like it or not.  The last three times they have been this way so ...three strikes and you're out!  Hey Mario's, you better listen to what your customer's want."}
{"text":"What? How anyone could rate this pizza higher than a 2 star on here is beyond me. Okay, I am a pizza connoisseur. I have had the best there is. First off this pizza lacks flavor. Not enough sauce and the sauce is not good. Secondly NEVER, and I mean NEVER put canned mushrooms on a pizza!!! No, NOPE, UH UH!! Big NO NO! This pizza is not even as good as some frozen pizzas that I have had. Sorry! I then tried Rosati's and now that is the real deal. It is take out only but man o man!! Rosati's is fantastic so don't wast your time with this place."}
{"text":"This place really used to be good but it's taken a interesting turn in the past few years! The quality of the pizza is lacking! Always super duper greasy and just doesn't taste good at all! And the wings are always like soggy which I guess can be a personal preference but I prefer a nice crispy wing! I hoped that things would turn around but it doesn't appear that Mario's is going to be a place I can count on anymore for a good pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, New York style, Greek salad and Mario's cheese steak special. Delivery (free) was within 30 minutes and the food was hot, fresh and tasty. Small salad was big enough for two and was very good."}
{"text":"I love Mario's. Best pizza in the surprise area. Also great ranch. But sometimes their chicken wing sauce gives me the trots. Go Mario."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. Loves their light sauce and everything is perfect.  Highly recommend to feel the pizzas out. More like New York real pizza."}
{"text":"I was visiting my house here in Surprise this week from Washington, DC.  Found this place on Yelp, and I am very impressed with the service and especially the pizza.  I have been looking for a great place to go that was near my house and this is the place."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. First of all, I appreciate a place that can deliver food on time. It's not real hard- I order food, you tell me when you expect it. Everywhere else around here is at least half an hour late- not these guys. They say 9-9:10 and they were here at 9:03. Secondly, and most importantly, the food is delicious. We've tried their pizza, buffalo rolls, spinach rolls, and calzone. Every one of them is better than the last (I did prefer the buffalo rolls over the spinach rolls). We asked for extra ranch and got it (which also isn't difficult)! Incredible food, timely delivery, friendly people! Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I went in for a slice of cheese. It was a nice big slice but it was pretty bland. Was going to order an extra large to-go but decided not to."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place. Their pizza is amazing. Their ranch is even better - homemade too! Their hoagies are delicious - especially the Italian. I haven't tried anything I don't love here. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Arizona.  Period.  You'll find very east coast style pizza here and beer to wash it down.  If you are from jersey or New York, get your pizza here and relive the good stuff.  Sorry to break the news, it's more than $1 a slice."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!!!!  I am not a huge fan of pizza un-american I know, this is awesome though.  A little on the pricey side for me, but is worth it.  Pizza's are huge and they don't skimp on the toppings, chz or sauce.  Owners are great and always funny.  Lots of tv's if you are looking for that but not to noisy.  Booths are large so you can go with a group and there are tables also."}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVORITE pizza place in AZ!!!! I've been coming here for 4 or 5 years now and I swear the taste just gets better. The owner is great. He's not very friendly but extremely friendly if that makes any sense... the wings are amazing and the pizza is delightful. I use to live in the area and one of the delivery drivers was or is the coolest guy I've ever met.   This place has great specials too.   YOU HAVE TO TRY THE FRIED MUSHROOMS!!!! Don't even get me going on the ranch....    Just go here. Really come here."}
{"text":"Not only is their pizza absolutely awesome... Mario's now DELIVERS!!!  I have to give them props because their delivery area is HUGE! Their menu shows they deliver from 107thave to Reems and from Bell to Olive. That's a much bigger area than the \"NY\" restaurant in Surprise (which I also love but they don't deliver - sorry guys... Mario's gets my business from now on)  I usually order the large pizza and wings special. Large is a good description - they can hardly close the box the pizza is so big! The whole pizza is well made and tastes spectacular. I do like their wings too although can be hit or miss with how crispy they turn out.   Word to the wise: I love spicy food and can generally tolerate a fair amount of heat, but their medium wing sauce is sometimes a bit to hot to be called medium. Don't get me wrong though, it is still delish and full of flavor.  I have dined in on occasion and their restaurant is very clean and has a ton of tv's tuned to sports. A couple of beers on tap as well as some bottled. Can this chick say \"Awesome. Beer, pizza and sports. Does it get much better?\""}
{"text":"Mario's is still great but still only getting 4/5 because -  Soda: Still iffy on the carbonation Sicilian: Not the best I have ever had Jal O Peno Popers: Are FANTASTIC  The NY style pizza is still in my top 2 of all time so do not pass Mario's by just because of a couple short comings."}
{"text":"This is not about the food. My coworkers and I used to order from them all the time for lunch. The guy that I spoke to on the phone was so rude when I tried to be nice about them forgetting our drinks. They said it would take a hour, prices for the drinks, and a delivery charge. Seriously??? They are literally 5 minutes from where I work. If I had the time, I would have driven there. I will never order from them again. When I told them that, the guy said \"oh well\". See ya...you guys lost A LOT of business from my work."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the food,seriously love the pizza and their steak hoagie is amazing!!!! The owner is always pleasant and his dad is super nice too!!!! Keep up the good work!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It appears that the miserable Pizza Palazzo has been overpowered and put to rest by the superior Mario's Pizza.   A concert I had tickets for was canceled (Danzig at Stage AE), so with a night off as a result, Kay and I figured it was high time we tried Mario's, a place we've been passing a bunch during our travels of late.  A special deal got us a whole hoagie, a pizza with one topping, and a dozen chicken wings for one price ($23).  The pizza, featuring our chosen topping in bacon, had a crust like a Southside Pretzel; it will strengthen your jaw muscles, let me tell ya. The sauce had the proper amount of sweetness to add some Yum Capital to the pie, and the cheese was generous. The brackishness of the bacon we added played off the honeyed sauce beautifully, reminding this diner that salt and sugar make quite the couple.   The garlic wings made me melancholy for each flat and drumette evoked memories of the recently departed George Aiken's chicken chain with their fatty, friable quality.   The soft of bun, fresh of vegetable, and slightly light on tuna hoagie was an acceptable filler that barely scores a victory over Subway's version.   Yeah, I can see us getting delivery from here often, but Beechview's SLICE on Broadway is a contender as well. I guess we'll have to flip for it, that is unless I keep finding more pizza parlors to review, and there are many left in the 'Burgh.  P.S. Our order came to the house within the 45 minute time frame and was correct."}
{"text":"Just ordered and after I managed to chew through the bland overcooked crust I was highly disappointed because the topping was not fresh like they were mushy. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"When I'm looking to have a pizza and a beer in a friendly environment this is the place i come. The staff is always friendly and beer always COLD!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat, let me say it took almost 2 hours from when I sent the order through GrubHub to when my order came. It's a Monday night. That wasn't cool. But I got a big hunk of cheesy garlic bread, bacon cheese fries, and a small half salami/olive/onion, half pepperoni/mushroom pie. It was all REALLY good! The garlic bread was pungent and extra cheesy. They serve the cheddar cheese sauce on the side for the fries so they don't get soggy, and it's the super salty processed cheese you want, too. And the pie was really good. Perfectly cooked crust and the sauce is just acidic and tangy enough. A little uneven distribution of the toppings, but I can't hate on that. I called when my order was late and Lou, the guy I talked to, was really nice and genuinely sounded like he cared. Plus he gave me a $10 credit the next time I call. Can't hate on that. Great food! Just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Ordered from here the first time back in June for my daughters bday. It was just ok. The crust was really tough and even tho it had just come out of the oven and we brought it straight home I think maybe it's just the way their pizzas are made. I loved the sauce and toppings but idk if we'll go back. It's a tad pricey to try again and see if the crust would be different"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday right before Halloween. We had a wedding rehearsal and needed somewhere that could accommodate our close friends and relatives from outta town. Marios took care of us . Everyone loved the food and service. We order from Mario's for delivery. Our first time eating in their building was this night."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review--I don't want anyone else to know how good this place is, because then I might have to wait longer for my order!  I love pizza, which is odd, since I've worked in pizza restaurants for over 15 years, off and on. The pizza I love more than any other? Mario's!   Mario's pizza starts with a crust that's excellent. it's never over-worked, too sweet or too yeasty. It's a perfect, chewy, crunchy base. The meats on Mario's pizzas are excellent. I've never had a better all-meat pizza! And there's just enough gooey cheese to hold it all together. My suggestion is you ask for a side of the marinara to smother your crusts in. There are chunks of tomato, subtle spices--not too sweet and not too spicy--and I'll fight anyone for the last bit in the bowl.   The best part about Mario's is the feeling you get when you're there. The staff is friendly, welcoming and just flat-out nice. I usually don't put tips in the tip jar when I just get a carry out meal, but I always do at Mario's. That's the kind of place it is.   Give Mario's a try...and then add the number to your speed dial list. It's just that good."}
{"text":"Perfect crispy crust. Prefect cheese to sauce ratio. How pizza should be. No frills customer service but my needs were more than met. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have never stepped foot in this place but it's hands down my favorite pizza place in or around the Robinson area these days. We discovered in GrubHub when they were one of the only places open that was still delivering. Their pizza, calzones, and 'rolls' are baked to perfection. If you ask for something on the side you actually get it. When they estimate your delivery time it's actually delivered during or before that window. I literally have no complaint about this business and we've now ordered from here three times. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to pizza places! Mario's has affordable pizza/wings specials and everyone is very friendly! Not to mention the pizza is delicious"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible!!! It took them over an hour to deliver it and when it finally arrived it was cold. I ordered a caprese salad and by the picture on the menu assumed it was a traditional caprese salad. I don't know what this was... lettuce, large tomatoes, barley any mozzarella, old rotten olives and covered in shredded parm. I asked for no mushroom and my wrap to come cold. It was warm and soggy and filled with mushrooms. Lastly, I asked for cheddar cheese SAUCE on my cheese fries.. I got cold shredded cheese that was hard as a rock! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Delivery is absolutely terrible. The food took TWO HOURS to get here, and when I called to ask about the delivery time the person that answered the phone simply told me \"We're understaffed so everything is slow.\" When I asked if they could contact the driver to see how much longer it would be I was hung up on. By the time the food arrived I was pretty mad, and the delivery driver simply said they are slow. Thanks. Food was mediocre after all of that. I will NEVER order from this place again. There are plenty of  great food places in the area - we certainly don't need ale delivery for not impressive food."}
{"text":"This is our family's \"Go to\" for pizza, calzones, wings, etc. Family owned and operated. Dine in, carry out or use their reliable delivery. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza on this sidevof town and great prices. Love them i always get them my family love's them"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious, but the wings left a lot to be desired. I will be eating their pizza again for sure!"}
