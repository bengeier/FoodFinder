{"text":"This restaurant serves a variety of Vietnamese dishes including pho and rice and pork chops but their signature dish is Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef noodle soup. The taste is very authentic and The restaurant fills up quickly around lunch time. A pot of tea is served wth each meal and the staff are quite attentive and are happy to take care of their patrons. When I was there, one of the serves overheard me say to a friend that I might want more fresh lime on the side, next thing I knew she came right back with a plate full of fresh lime. What customer service! 
I haven't yet found a place in town that makes a better bun bo hue than this one!"}
{"text":"It's funny that this place is called \"Bun Bo Hue\" and people came in ordering pho and complained about it. I have been a long time customer, since 2006 having been introduced by a Vietnamese friend. A couple years back I guess due to the relative obscurity of the \"bun bo Hue\" dish, they renamed themselves adding the \"pho\" as that seemed to be the only food non-Vietnamese knew about Vietnamese cuisine

Let's get to the food: bun bo Hue is a vermicelli dish, with beef shank, pork, lemongrass and lots of other herbs. This restaurant has the dish perfectly cooked. The soup base is tasty and a little bit spicy, the meat perfect. One of the hardest thing in cooking bun bo Hue is the handling of the shrimp paste. It must be there to realize the full potential of the soup base, but must not leave its slightly pungent trace behind. This place handled that perfectly. The other places (Pho Dau Bo, Pho Mi 99, etc) failed badly in this respect and I could clearly smell the shrimp paste in their soup. Some other Vietnamese places even use the pho soup base for their bun bo hue. At this restaurant, bun bo Hue is simply heaven. I ordered a large bowl every time (they recently hiked the price to something like $8.50, still a deal).

Service is fast and as expected for a typical Vietnamese joint. That means you can expect basic service, order from a piece of paper. Overall, their bun bo Hue, is the best in town. I never tried the other dishes, why try pho in a bun bo Hue place?"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the bun bo hue here. They usually do a good job. I also enjoy their fried rice dish when I'm not feeling for soup."}
{"text":"The best bun Bo hue in the city. It's a very spicy dish and very favourful.
They only accept cash."}
{"text":"This is it. My all time favorite pho store. I always order the bun bo hue; their specialty. I know i know it's bun and not pho but their pho is up to par as well. However i am so addicted to the soup i used to visit the store every Saturday for about 3 years. I don't have the time to go as much now but whenever someone asks me \"hey Kevin, where do you feel like eating?\" This is the place i name."}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall restaurant for Vietnamese food. My Vietnamese friends took me here for an authentic experience to sample their favourite dish. I was pleasantly surprised.  Ordered their specialty, the bun bo hue. We all loved this flavorful vermucielli beef noodle dish. We also had the shrimp appetizers and very refreshing drink/dessert as seen in the pic. All were very good. I highly recommend coming here if you like the spicy bun bo hue."}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week! Best Vietnamese restaurant in this area. Love their soups and spring rolls!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is called Bun Bo Hue. They have THE BEST bun bo hue in Toronto! 

The ONLY reason they place gets a 4 instead of 5 is because the other items on their menu are meh. Honestly, just come here for their specialty, don't be crazy and get pho here. Just be basic. 

My grandma craves this. I mean, if you can get a Vietnam-born person to crave you food. it is as authentic as it gets. The broth is packed with flavor, their noodles are fresh and have that chew to it, sliced pork, sliced beef, liver and pork blood. Topped with fresh thinly sliced cabbage and fresh herbs. the best meal ever. 

There is nothing else that brings me back home, then a small bowl of their Bun Bo Hue. 
Try it! You won't regret it! 

Happy Belly :)

*recommendation*
Come here during brunch/lunch since the soup is most fresh then!"}
{"text":"First off, let me tell you that I make awesome bun bo hue. I make it like the lady in Vietnam that Anthony Bourdain raves about. So when I say the bun bo hue here is pretty good, then it is!
I ordered the bun bo hue, pho with rare and beef balls, shrimp fresh rolls, fried spring rolls and fruit smoothies: durian, sour sop and coconut.

Bun bo hue was generous and flavourful, the noodles were thin and a tad soft, I like mine thicc with a bit of bite to it, the broth had depth which takes a while to build without the aid of msg.
On a side note, my husband ordered bun bo hue as well, his came out luke warm while mine was boiling hot. Not sure what THAT was about.

Pho was delicious with flavour and depth, a litttle greasier than most and the beef balls had bits of tendon and gristle in it which I didn't like but some people do.

Shrimp rolls didn't have much shrimp to it but had lots of mint and other greens.
Fried spring rolls were crisp, not greasy but a bit bland and didn't come with a dipping sauce.
Smoothies were great! Smooth and creamy and full of the fruit flavour.

Best part was afterwards I didn't die of thirst which means they don't use tons of msg.

Service was quick and efficient. I would go back."}
{"text":"Taste like authentic Vietnamese home cooking!!!  Gotta love that..  I order some sort of noodles with shrimp paste #6 on menu and my wife ordered their signature noodle #1 on menu.  Both noodles were 10/10!!..."}
{"text":"Small restaurant serving delicious Vietnamese food. Quick and efficient service.
My favourites are duck vermicelli noodle soup, fresh rolls and bun bo hue. They also sell takeout dessert, Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk (must try). 

Cash only"}
{"text":"I tried the Highly recommended Bun Bo Hue, Hot Spicy beef Pho and I was disappointed. Maybe my expectation was too high. The soup was very greasy and not steaming hot. Beef was  overcooked, Well Done, hard to chew. The flavour of the soup was  not as good as other Pho places in Toronto. My wife ordered the Rare beef Pho, the flavour of the soup was better but still very greasy and soup was also not steaming hot but beef was also over cooked to well done. I suspect the chef actually cooked the beef in the soup before serving it. Staff not so friendly. No smiles. The place was busy though, Friday at 1:30 pm but still full house, which i don't understand. The location is not the best, I felt uncomfortable driving there with an expensive car. Price was reasonable compared with other Pho places but the portion was only average, definitely not abundant as some people said. Maybe you have to order extra large, we ordered medium and were a bit skimpy. Would I go again? No."}
{"text":"I love mom and pop shops, especially for Pho.  This place has got a great home-y vibe and the service was great, but the soup itself was a little bland, and maybe that's just be over accustomed to everything else being higher in salt/msg.

But overall a worthwhile place."}
{"text":"I can't believe nobody has written a review for Bun Bo Hue yet! Its been around for at least 8 years! 

We ordered the Goi cuon (Beef and pork summer rolls) to start.  The rice paper was not of good quality and the roll itself was not very flavorful. Skip!

Bun Bo Hue is actually the name of a noodle dish - a spicy noodle dish made of beef, pork and vermicelli. It had had cha lua (Vietnamese pork ham) and beef in it. The soup base was excellent and boy did it have a kick to it!  My sinuses definitely cleared up upon consuming this dish.

Boyfriend had the Pho Tai Gan Sach which was made with well-done beef, beef tendon and beef tripe.  The beef was a little overtenderized and the tripe was cut too thin in my opinion.  The soup base was absolutely disappointing! 

We also ordered a cold Vietnamese filtered coffee with condensed milk. It tasted more like chocolate milk that was doused in condensed milk. No coffee flavour at all!

I would come back for nothing other than the Bun Bo Hue and even then I don't know that I'd drive all the way from the East end to dine here again as there are far better places closer to home."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout. It was ready in 15 minutes, food was good. Veggies tasted fresh. Shrimp had veins in them. reasonable price for that portion."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food around. Great fresh food and excellent service. Been going there for years."}
{"text":"My sister and I were craving Bun Bo Hue one day and she recommended that we go here for dinner. The restaurant was busy and lively when we arrived. There were empty tables so we were seated immediately. 

We bother ordered Bun Bo Hue and asked for one bowl to be less spicy (my sister wrote the request in viet) but they ignored the request and made it as is lol. I have a lower tolerance for spicy food, but still managed. The portions were generous especially with the meat. The food was good but this restaurant is pretty dingy, it could definitely be refreshed. 

Overall the bun bo hue here is really good I would definitely come back whenever I crave bun bo hue"}
{"text":"My parents rarely goes out to restaurants because they prefer their own home cooking. But when they do go out, one of their go-to is Bun Bo Hue restaurant. \"It's just as good as back home\"

We usually get the number one special: Bun Bo Hue. When your restaurant is named after it, then you know they got a reputation to maintain. And they don't disappoint. I highly recommend it. Make sure to make use of those fresh vegies that comes along with the dish. Adds an extra level of flavor. 

Pro tip: you can ask that the broth be \"no fat\" for a lighter flavor/taste."}
{"text":"The most authentic bun bo hue I've ever had! Very similar flavour profile as the bun served in Hue, Vietnam.

I've been meaning to try out this place for a long time but the drive is pretty far for me. I was so glad I was in the neighbourhood finally to try this place out. It did not disappoint! 

The bun bo hue comes with a very large variety of different cuts of meats (ham, shank, pork blood.. so much meat!!). The shank was kind of chewy but everything else was delicious. I was genuinely so surprised by how much toppings they gave us.

The broth was very rich in flavour. It wasn't too spicy. You can definitely taste that the beef bones have been brewing for hours with the lemon grass.

The place was pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon with high turnover rate. We didn't have to wait for our table.

Definitely recommending this place to everyone who wants the BEST and most authentic bun bo hue!!! Yummmm!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in a wall type mom and pop Vietnamese restaurant. If you expect clean and modern decor, this is not the place for you. 

I was referred by a friend to come here for there bun hue - who doesn't love spicy Vietnamese noodle soup ?! 

Unfortunately it disappointed. Ordered number 1, their infamous bun hue. The broth was not spicy enough. The portion size was average. 

We ordered fried spring roll - had better elsewhere. Don't bother with this dish. 

Try not to use the bathroom - the floor is slippery in the basement. 

I saw a couple of flies that want our food too, so expect to shoo flies away as you eat.

This place is in a sketchy part of the city.  There is parking in the plaza but a lot of traffic"}
{"text":"Restaurant is a small and homely. Servers were not dressed professionally. My grandma's favourite spot. Tray of condiments are kind of in my way. I was sitting close to the wall.
Ordered 1 med Bon Bo Hue. It came within 20 minutes. Although not everyone's dish came at the same time. They came somewhat close together. There was an addition dish of thinly shredded cabbage, lime onions and mint/ herbs to put in the soup. We asked for more herbs. The table was pretty small.
The blood pudding was not the freshest and neither was the cuts of meat imo. The quality of the meat was mostly fat. The broth was savoury with a hint of sweetness and spice. As expected the dish smelled very fishy although my parents suggest it was not fishy enough."}
{"text":"Great place for bun bo hue."}
{"text":"Started off with Goi cuon (Beef and pork summer rolls) Rice paper was inferior & contents were not at all flavorful.

Bun Bo Hue is a spicy noodle dish made of beef, pork & vermicelli. It had had cha lua (Vietnamese pork ham) & beef. The soup base was quite good.

I ordered  Pho Tai Gan Sach which consists of well-done beef, beef tendon & beef tripe.  The beef was overly tenderized & the tripe was cut way too thin & the soup base was a downer. 

Ordered a cold Vietnamese filtered coffee with condensed milk. It tasted like chocolate milk given a shot of condensed milk. It seemed there was no actual coffee in it.

Novelty place to come to but there are other places in the East to attend & much better places closer to me."}
{"text":"Ah bun bo hue, the other famous Vietnamese noodle soup next to pho. 

Bun bo hue, or literal translation, beef vermicelli noodles Hue style in soup is a dish originating from the central highlands of Hue in Vietnam. Hue is one of the larger cities in Vietnam, where the weather is temperate with hot humid summers.  In the winter months it can quite chilly so hence, the need for this dish.

A bowl of bun bo Hue by design is suppose to be  a fine balance of spicy, sour, salty and sweet flavors , with shrimp paste and especially lemon grass the main dominating ingredient.  Spicy chilly oil is added near the end to further enhance the flavor.  You could also leave this out for the more timid diners, but of course, if you do this it wouldn't be as authentic.  As a matter of fact, having been to the city of Hue in Vietnam, this might be taken as an insult if you were to order a bowl of this dish after the city's namesake and asking to leave the chilly oil out while in Hue. lol!

Anyway, the decor here can be described as cold and sterile, with minimal thought placed into the overall ambience, which might be off putting for some.  However, it keeps it simple and places the focus on the food which is what this place shines at.

The location is in a strip plaza off of the highway 400/Finch, about a 5 minutes drive west of Jane & Finch.

The staff speaks minimal heavy accented English, enough to take your order and any special requests you may have.  

I ordered a large bowl of bun bo Hue as did my friend.  It came within 5 minutes with a heavy plate of side fixings that includes banana sprouts, bean sprouts, lime, the typical stuff you'd find at a Vietnamese pho restaurant.  

The bowl was steaming hot, I could smell the lemongrass as the subtle flavors awoken my nostrils as my mouth watered in anticipation of that first bite.

That first sip of the soup? Nirvana.  At long last, a place that does bun bo Hue right.

All of the taste buds were hitting the correct notes, sweet, sour, spicy, everything!  I love this soup! Noodles were cooked perfectly, the beef shanks were flavorful, I was blown away.

The next 10 minutes we ate in silence appreciating what was the best bun bo Hue both of us ever had. My friend was initially skeptical as he swears and dies by pho, but I can gladly say he is now a convert of this other lesser known Vietnamese beef noodle soup.

One can say that pho is overdone thanks to the ingenuity of the abundant Vietnamese community, and this place may have recognized it and decided to specialize in bun bo Hue instead.   Pho is offered on the menu, as is the other common Vietnamese rice dishes but I do not know how it fares to their main dish, the namesake of this restaurant.

Bun bo Hue lovers, you must come to this place and have a bowl or two!  I did! And I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Didn't like the Bun Bo Hue...  Love pho, don't love this.
The pho was also not as good as most other pho restaurants; meat was fatty.
Would not return."}
{"text":"Nothing has come close to the bun bo hue dish that I had earlier this year in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam...but this one came closest. The broth was great and had strong shrimp paste flavours but is just as rich as the one in Vietnam. Deducting one star as the shrimp taste almost over powers the presence of a beef broth. It came with a TON of meat and the prices were extremely generous! Will definitely return for another bowl of noodle soup!"}
{"text":"This is what I miss most in Asia - the little mom and pop stores that specialize in one food.

There's a lot of \"fusion\" foods in Toronto that are good, and even more that are not. I'm not against fusion food, but sometimes it's hard to find a place that just makes one of those things well and sticks to it.

This place has a large variety of combination pho, bun (rice vermicelli), com (rice) and specialize in bun no hue (hence the name).

My other half and I came on a Sunday night and they were consistently busy even though this pace is quite out of the way.

Portions are very large. I ordered the \"special\" pho (combination of everything) and every bite of noodle i had a piece of meat or something else.

Lots of pho places full your bowl with the noodles and give a few pieces of beef, but this place really fills your bowl with extra meat and food.

Good portions, excellent price, very satisfied.

Would definitely come back if in the area"}
{"text":"Love coming here for Bun Bo Hue or Bun Mung Vit. The people here are very nice and service is quick! Parking sometimes is tough to get if you go during busy hours as it is located in a strip plaza. 

Bun Bo Hue is spicy and flavourful. Bun Mung Vit has duck, bamboo shoots and is very hearty as well! 

Eating here doesn't hurt the pocket! Everything is pretty much less than $10, great cheap eats and very filling as well!"}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto from Little Saigon, California, so it is not easy to find a good Vietnamese restaurant as some of them in Bolsa.  Also, I do most of Vietnamese cooking myself and I am a pretty decent cook.  Therefore, I am quite picky about Vietnamese foods.

I was craving for Bún Bò Hu this morning and after checking out several Vietnamese restaurants near my house that offersBún Bò Hu, I decided to order a large Bún Bò Hu to go from this restaurant.  To my pleasant surprise, the portion was huge. The broth was perfect without MSG.  The portion was big enough for two meals and it was only $10.20 with tax included.  Banana blossom was the only missing item and I wish there are a bit more herbs and veggies since I am a veggies lover.   I definitely will come back for Bún Bò Hu and try out other dishes on the menu and will update this review.

For now I highly recommended Bún Bò Hu from this this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I visited Bun Bo Hue last night, after one of my dad's clients from the west end recommended this place for the Bun Bo Hue (I guess that's why they call the restaurant such? Haha).

When I arrived at around 8:30pm, there was only another table being seated. I understand it was a little late, but it did make me a bit curious. I ordered #3 and my dad ordered #6 (see Yvonne T's photos for descriptions), and we also added a pork strip rice paper roll.

A few minutes before we got our bowls, there was a foul smell of what seemed like fecal matter coming from either the kitchen or washroom. It lasted about 10 minutes and ended when our food arrived. In a way it was a little uncomfortable for my dad and I.

#3 tasted decent, the vermicelli was quite good and the ingredient quantity was passable. The broth didn't taste anything special, and I wasn't able to really taste the \"sour\"ness until around halfway thru my meal.

My dad really liked #6 for its authenticity. He has a slight preference for the Vietnamese-Chinese hybrid design they use for Kim Po (I guess he's used to it), but did give good remarks for its taste and portion size.

The pork strip rice paper roll was average. I definitely prefer Kim Po's as the vermicelli here was too thin for my liking.

Overall I like this place for authenticity. It missed the ballpark a bit in terms of exoticness, but for the amount I paid and what I got in return I must say it wasn't too bad, and I will definitely consider returning."}
{"text":"I never had bun bo hue before so I want sure what to expect. For the most part, I loved it. It looks like a really spicy soup, but it's a mixture of sweet, sour, and spicy. It had a lot of flavor and filled me up just enough. The only downside is that they only take cash, but there is an atm in one of the convenience stores."}
{"text":"Definitely one of Toronto hidden gems! The bun bo hue here is amazing! The broth and meat is very good."}
{"text":"Nice small authentic Vietnamese restaurant located just west of Hwy 400.  Nothing really fancy about this place.  The decor is simple and old fashioned.  That's not why you come here though.  The first item on their menu Bún Bò Hué is the item I always order.  Delicious spicy broth with beef, pork, and pork blood.

You can of course enjoy the typical Vietnamese dishes if you're not that daring.  All of them are just as good.
Ample parking in front and at the side of the plaza.  Make sure you bring your appetite and most of all bring cash.  They only accept cash likely to keep costs down.

I drive all the way from DVP and Sheppard to this place and it's more than worth it every time."}
{"text":"bun bo hue specializes in bun bo hue, and there Pho is really good

make sure you get the sugar cane drink too"}
{"text":"Best bun bo hue and beef pho I've ever had!! My Vietnamese friend recommend me to try this place. Both broths are perfect!! I'll definitely come here again try other menu:)"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad but the flavour of the soup keeps changing its like as if they keep getting more and more cheap on the ingredients they put inside the soup. The staff doesn't seem to care, just seems like they are there just to collect their wages and leave."}
{"text":"Nothing like a nice bowl of home made Bun Bo Hue ....at a restaurant! This is hands down my favourite Bun Bo Hue restaurant ever - it tastes just like how my grandma makes it and my family is from Hue so you knowwww its the real deal when I say it tastes just like my grandma's cooking!! It also tastes just like how it did in Hue when I visited years ago... If you are looking for authentic bun bo hue you need to try this place!! 

The portion is really good, and this is the only place I've been to that offers different sizes for the bun bo hue. Their avocado milkshake is also the best - unlike other pho restaurants where theres way too much ice, or too little ice. 

Service is pretty much non-existent, but that shouldn't be surprising at a pho restaurant LOL

The only negative thing I can say is that they only take cash... but there is a convenience store just a couple stores down with an ATM!

I didn't try any of their other menu, but I can definitely vouch for their bun bo hue. You. NEED. TO. TRY. IT!!!"}
{"text":"We always travel all the way here from Markham every time we feel like bun bo hue. It's definitely worth it! The portions are good, and you will never leave on an empty stomach. The food comes out quick, the soup has a good amount of spice, and is definitely flavourful. This is the only pho place I know of that has more than 1 size for bun bo hue.

There are many seatings, super casual. It's cleaner than most pho places, 4 stars because we always get the bun bo hue and yet to try anything else! It's cash only so bring cash!"}
{"text":"When a restaurant names themselves after a dish, you know it's a must order. Came here with my Vietnamese boyfriend and he swears the large is the only way to go. He was not wrong. Hot bowl of Bun Bo Hue was served with so much meat, and the vegetables they provide go great with cooling the spiciness of the broth. The flavours are exquisite, you can definitely taste the lemongrass amongst the spice. Ordered an iced coffee as well and drip coffee was made to order so it does take a while. Small homey restaurant with definitely the best bun bo hue I've ever had. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area and one of my favs in the gta. The pho ga and spring rolls are very good and all of there rice dishes are really good to."}
{"text":"This is the place I go for if I crave for Pho. One of the best Vietnamese Restaurant that's I've tried in Toronto. Their home made chili oil with lemongrass is a Must try!"}
