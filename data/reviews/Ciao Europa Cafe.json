{"text":"I love this place. The staff is incredibly hospitable and the pizzas are some of the best in the city.

They always make you feel like a local."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner here, caesar salad and caprese salad, followed by eggplant parmigiana and their lasagna.   The service was excellent and the espresso was a perfect finish.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous, authentic Italian food and excellent, personal service at a reasonable price! We flew in from Alberta to visit our daughter and son-in-law in Liberty Village and stopped in for lunch. The food and service were so amazing that we came back for dinner. Deso and his family owned restaurant served us omelettes, fresh pasta and crispy thin crust, fungi and truffle oil  pizza bursting with flavour. House wines at $1.00 an ounce are an exceptional value but we went for the Thurs. special bottle at  20% off and the draft beer snd pizza special. We followed it up with coffee and a variety of desserts including kiwi cheesecake and tiramisu. In spite of the variety of restaurants available we chose to return and were gifted with a complementary charcuterie  tray! Thank you Deso!"}
{"text":"Ciao Europe is a lovely little family run neighbourhood place that recently opened in Liberty Village. It has delicious pizza, the coffee is amazing and the desserts are all homemade. It's a little out of the way of the restaurant scene in Liberty so it's easy to miss, but it's well worth the trip. In fact, it's so good I'm hesitant to let people know about it, but there are so many chains in Liberty are terrible that I think people should get out and support quality."}
{"text":"I got off work late and needed a quick bite for dinner. I picked up the phone and called Cia Europa. They answered the phone and I asked the person how they were and the response was warm and pleasant. I had a craving for a simple beef lasagna. I asked if it was on the menu today (they make things fresh) and they did. In fact I had 2 options. Either beef lasagna or chick peas with sausage.  

I went with the beef lasagna to satisfy my craving and a side order of mista salad. Total was $19.15 and it would be ready in 10 minutes. It was ready when I went to pick it up. Let me say that every bite was delicious and the salad was fresh and vinigrette was light and tangy (not overpowering). If want good food this is a good place to try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem in Liberty Village. The pizzas are fresh and very very good. Wine is $1 per ounce which is pretty awesome. The staff and owner are so friendly as well. I would definitely go back here. It's sort of off the main 'strip' of restaurants in the area - but it is well worth the detour. My new favourite in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the staff very friendly. Pricing was very decent considering the location

They place was clean and the atmosphere was nice although the place is small, it feels homey.

However, they have TERRIBLE ventilation. Left smelling like heavy odorous cooking. Even after a thorough shower, it took another day or two for the smell to go away. Also had to wash my clothes and send my jacket to the dry cleaners. The ventilation alone makes me think twice about paying them another visit.

Hope they do something about that. There aren't any decent breakfast places in Liberty."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My husband and I finally decided to come in on a Tuesday night. The restaurant ambiance is intimate and cozy. The food was superb. The best pizza we have had outside of Europe and definitely rivals those establishments for taste and quality. We had the pizza Bianca and carbonara. It was delicious. Even the olive oil that was served with the bread was delectable. The waiters were attentive and knowledgeable and the owner took the time to check in on everyone during the meal. We had a great time and I'm sure this will now be a place we will visit on a more regular rotation."}
{"text":"It looks like they have lots to offer. I only strolled in with the baby for a quick coffee. They have one price for all sizes of coffee and everything is on a self-serve table, sort of like a convenience store. I will be back to try the food and update review."}
{"text":"This review is for the cappuccino only as the desserts weren't enticing to say the least. The setup is nice and cozy and they even have a space dedicated for music where they apparently have a LIVE band Fridays. 
Now for starters the service was quite off putting. With a curt response and don't bother me I have better things to do demeanor. I probably won't be back just because of that as even though there are mainly chain offerings for the java fix I can take my money where it is appreciated. 
On to the cappuccino 
Esperesso Strong (They use Doi Chaang not sure this was a single estate but packed a wallop)
Crema: Decent
Latte Art: N/A
Milk: frothed poorly
This would have been a decent drink had the proportions of espresso to milk were better but nope they got it quite wrong. Milk was just a small amount with the espresso shot compromising 2/3 of the drink.
1.5 stars all said and done."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Had an amazing first time a few months ago and went back again last night with friends. Delicious food, great service and love the intimate atmosphere. 

I ordered a dozen chocolate croissants to pick up this morning for my office and they were freshly baked and ready to go when I got there. It was a huge hit with the office.

Highly recommend this place. Best pizza and pasta i've had in the city."}
{"text":"I wanted something besides a mass-produced egg sandwich and had seen the good reviews. I was greeted warmly by the staff and directed to a table, immediately served water and gave my order. 
The fried eggs were nicely prepared, accompanied by bacon, potatoes and some strawberries.
It was a nice amount of food, a good price, and I received it quickly.
I hope to return for another meal on a future visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Italian pasta for dinner! I don't usually comment on Italian food because it doesn't impress me but the chef here has converted me. He's from the Trieste region in Italy  and I need to go visit that city if they all cook like this haha but honestly go order the pasta of the day with some wine  it's so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food and drinks. Tried their breakfast pizza today and latte and had a great time with some friends. Although simple, the pizza was awesome! Thin crust, cheese, bacon, and an egg in the center - a nice mix of italian and american together. The latte, pretty tasty but could be better with the presentation. The service is awesome, no complaints here."}
{"text":"Great local spot - the pizza was to die for, better than any pizzeria in Toronto. The service was wonderful. Great value, will definitely be back!"}

Hit and miss espresso beverages

Summary:
The Ciao Europa Cafe is a great little place to study or work remotely on projects. I think the prices are amazing. The owner of the cafe is around most days and is super pleasant to talk to. All the staff are polite and helpful. The layout is a bit cozy but it works for a quick breakfast/lunch. The food and prices are great and I definitely recommend a panini or pizza. If you are vegan it would probably not be the place for you, however vegetarian options I think are good enough for you to enjoy basic (but justified with price) Italian food. ALSO the wine and drinks are priced super reasonably.

I think that the espresso beverages have improved drastically since they opened, I think new staff have an effect on this. Recently the cappuccino has been good, in the past it's been more like a latte... I think with every business there are a few hiccups here and there, but considering they have not been open that long, it's super amazing and definitely (I hope) will be around for the future.

It's cool that they cook the food basically in front of you! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food (the mushroom pizza is a must-try). Fabulous espresso. Good prices. Overall great atmosphere. And, the people there are super great."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant tucked away in Liberty Village. Super friendly staff and owners, and great food. We shared a pizza with prosciutto and the pasta and meatballs, which were both great. Also can't go wrong with $1 an ounce wine selections!"}
{"text":"Everything about this little gem in Liberty Village is fantastic: the food is fresh, flavourful and the menu is constantly enhanced by new items. The owners are as passionate about their food and wine as they are about providing great, personalized service. It feels more like being the honoured guest in their home then restaurant service. Every time I come to Ciao Europa I'm treated to a complimentary taste of wine or mouthwatering dessert. Tonight, it was both!"}
{"text":"This place makes an excellent pasta.  It's made from scratch.
Their beef & Brie pizza stopped me in my tracks.  The head chef even gave my kid a cookie on the house.  Will definitely return! 
Prices are reasonable. People should check it out.  
Love the quaint atmosphere. A nice little culinary adventure for my family."}
{"text":"A m a z i n g ! ! ! 

Where's the sixth star?! Located in the Liberty village, quaint and modern. We came here for wine and dinner. Very, very friendly, passionate and super helpful owner! Loved our food and wine! All homemade, made in-house. There was even live music Friday evening, it was so lovely!

We were treated very well, top shelf! 

Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"The best food with the best service. It is my absolute favourite place to go! A must try!"}
{"text":"Everything about our visit to Ciao was great.
We came here for a weekend brunch.
They had their full menu during brunch, plus a few brunch specials. One of those was the breakfast pizza, which I ordered for myself.
The pizza was delicious: great crust, with very flavorful bacon and eggs.
My partner has dietary restrictions with dairy but they were very accommodating, which is specially impressive at a place where most of the menu items includes some variety of cheese.
She ended up having bolognese pasta. The pasta was freshly made, and very well seasoned.
On top of that, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"A fantastic little gem tucked away in Liberty Village.  
I had walked by many times, noticing that they always seemed to have a nice crowd.  So, we decided to give it a try.  We've been back three times since.
Everything is fresh.  Pasta (made daily) has been different every time we've eaten here.  Pizzas are also highly recommended.
Pretty good wine list.
Everything is reasonably priced.
And, the staff do the little things right, such as customizing your meal, making great wine suggestions and offering great daily specials.
It's now a regular in our Liberty Village rotation."}
{"text":"Ciao is a true gem in liberty village. My family has dined here several times for both brunch and dinner, and the food and service is always top notch. The carbonara is my husband's go to and I love the lasagna. The portions are perfect, we always leave full. We have a 1.5 year old daughter and they're very accommodating to her as well. They truly make you feel like family."}
{"text":"This place is such a little gem. Tucked away in the residential side of Liberty Village, you wouldn't normally expect much but the food is delicious, they have draft German beer and the service is impeccable.

Everyone who works here is really friendly and you always feel as though you are being welcomed in with genuine warmth. 

I can't believe this place is in LV.. a great find for sure!"}
{"text":"I think this is a great spot with nice and fresh food. The servers are always pleasant. One odd thing about this establishment is that the owner is constantly yelling at his staff about what they're doing wrong. It's fairly awkward. I get that he cares about the quality of food but surely you could have meetings in the back or communicate in a more calm fashion. For this reason I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was in town on biz and stayed nearby so I had breakfast and lunch here in one day. It's a wonderful atmosphere and the owner is perfectly surely-pretending with a big heart. The food was very good. Poached eggs with small sides of bacon, sausage, potatoes and orange slice. Delicious multi grain bread rounds to top it off. The croissants looked great but no room to try. Coffee is high quality, also had a good latte at lunch. They happily accommodated my friend with gluten free bread. At lunch we had one of their pre-made prosciutto, mozzarella, and eggplant sandwiches, which they heated and split up for us. I'm sure the pizza is great too. This would totally be my neighborhood spot if I lived nearby."}
