{"text":"Pros: From breads and fries to steaks everything taste really good. Rami and Danielle served us . They were professional and accommodating .  Cons: long wait and expensive food"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Keg once or twice a year and I usually come to this one especially. I think it is good value for the money. The steaks tonight were very good, done to our liking, but I wish they wouldn't over salt the meat so much. I do like the portions, especially on the classic dinner where you get an appetizer, a choice of several mains, mushrooms and one side for under $30 plus tax (for the top sirloin selection, more for the others). A bottle of Wolf Blass was about $32, a fairly good price as compared to many more expensive restaurants in town.   The waitress wasn't that great though. She didn't refill the water until late in the meal and she asked us if we wanted more bread, which she didn't bring to us until I reminded her about it a second time. She said she forgot about it. In addition the other negative thing is that parking isn't easy here. We had to go quite a distance because it was so busy. We had to park at the back at another building that has private parking but it was after hours for that business and no one was at work in the evening. Obviously the Keg has inadequate parking for the number of people at their restaurants. The place was also very busy. This time we had to wait for about 20 minutes. I wish they would take reservations and make it easier for their guests."}
{"text":"I was always told that the Keg has consistent food and service, but unfortunately that was not the case. My dad and I, came to this location last Sunday and I was very disappointed at the service and the quality of food. I don't recall the waitress introducing herself, and she looked quite miserable to be working that day. My dads steak was cooked well, but I was horribly disappointed at the ribs that I received. I also decided to opt out of dessert for that reason as well.   Overall, I would go to the Keg again, but I wouldn't risk it at this location."}
{"text":"LESLIE STREET KEG 1977 Leslie Street Toronto, Ontario M3B 2N3 Canada   I was slightly disappointed when I entered your restaurant on Saturday May 3, 2014. We showed up at about 5:30 p.m. A hostess sadly relayed that our wait time would be about two hours--that did not bode well with us. We decided to seek comfort in the elevated lounge, the intimate seating area by the fireplace. I wasn't expecting too much, other than mediocre service found in most restaurants these days. However, we had a charismatic server named Lena who made our stay welcoming and inviting. She was excellent in her duties, anticipating our needs before we realized it was a need, like topping our bottom glasses of ice tea before we had fully drained it, or sprinkling your famous sour dough bread when the rations were growing meager. She was delightful and funny, providing a level of ambience that added to the pleasant decorum. We may have not been sitting in the dinning room, but my family and I felt we had the full dining experience. Special thanks to Lena for living up to the standard of excellence that the Keg is known around the world for.   Sincerely, Jonathan S. Phoenix"}
{"text":"We came here after work one night... it was the only place still open, and we had a gift card, so we thought why not.  Their kitchen was pretty much closed when we arrived, but they invited us in, sat us down, and took our order anyway.  We each got steak, and didn't expect too much, given the only patrons left were the dwindling bar crowd.    However, our steaks were cooked perfectly to order, tasted amazing, and our \"Midnight Snack\" was excellent all-around.  The sides were a little bland and average-looking, and the temperature in the restaurant was frigid, but that could have been timing issues.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience, and never once felt rushed despite the lateness of our arrival.  I would definitely go back, and recommend this place as a solid steakhouse option for any occasion."}
{"text":"I submitted a review back awhile ago but it magically disappeared ..?????  .   Best Keg in Toronto .   .. The Keg on Leslie Street is by far the best .  Great summer Patio with sun on it . Nice set up inside with fireplace and lots of comfortable seating in the large Bar area.   Great Service and the food is always delicious.   Best Escargot in Toronto and the Billy Miner Pie is out of this world - so delicious!    I was there in mid-September and had the nicest server - .. Brian  ..Received Exceptional service from him.   .  Then went back end of November for my Birthday and was delighted to see that Brian was my server .. very friendly and once again went all out to make sure my Birthday was special!  I have pretty much tried all of the dinner's and never been disappointed. ,,    Their prices keep going up ..  but feel it is worth it to spend the extra money, as I enjoy their food, atmosphere and most of all the attentive staff... especially Brian !"}
{"text":"This is a large steakhouse chain based in Canada but have many locations in U.S. too.  We came here for a late lunch.  As suggested, the prime rib sandwich was very nice.  Tenderness was just right and the dipping juice was nice too.  But the hefeweizen style beer (forgot the brewery name) had a funny taste to it.  Inside the decor was very modern right down to the washroom.  A pretty good place for lunch or after work."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the prime rib at The Keg, cooked to a medium rare. The complete dinner has a salad and comes with a side of roasted veggies (asparagus/peppers/zuhcinni/mushroom) and choice of potatoes. The twice baked potatoe is great. I had a very fatty piece, which I promptly pointed out to the server. (It was probably half fat and just looked gross) They quickly took it away and gave me a leaner cut. Overall aside from this hiccup i find the food very enjoyable. This location is always packed. (Also don't think they take reservations on the weekend) Even coming at shortly after 5, we had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This is the best Keg of all the ones that I've been to and its also my local go to place. Food is great, service is #1 and absolutely amazing. Bacon wrap scallop, Grilled shrimp and the three way fillet are my Favorites at the bar/lounge area.  Chef is great and knows how to make a proper Blue Rare steak! Try the Prime Rib Sliders, they are also very good. Staff are friendly and extremely nice, the place is wonderful over all."}
{"text":"Best steak I ever had in a while. This is also the best Keg location. The food, service & experience was real good. I had the Top Sirloin steak cooked well done with fries. They serve you bread while you wait and it tasted very fresh. With my steak  I also ordered 2 dipping sauces on side: au jus & peppercorn. What a difference! The steak was cooked perfectly and even though it was well done it still was tender & juicy. The dipping sauces kicked it up a notch to level 10! I had a blast.   Fave dish:  top sirloin steak with extra spices cooked well done with 2 dipping sauces on the side (au jus & peppercorn)"}
{"text":"Good steak... but ambience is too loud!! We can't hear ourself talking... as tables beside ours were too loud.... kid friendly...."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location there is a long wait and no parking. And every time I call ahead to make reservations it seems they are not taking reservations and the person who answers the phone is always rude. Yet when I go to any other Keg such as The Mansion or Yonge and Eglinton or even in Mississauga I never experience this. I would rather drive the distance to visit another location than deal with this locations bs"}
{"text":"My date and I had an enjoyable time at The Keg last night. James was our sever, and he was attentive, and was quick to get us water, and our order in quickly. He was funny and was engaging.   The food is always excellent, every time we come here, it is always en pointe in how we like our steak, and style.   I had a great experience, and this Keg in particular never disappoints. Thank you James for making this experience especially wonderful."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse I have been. The location is also very good and it has outdoor patio. The only problem is that it is a bit overcrowded but it is understandable taking into account the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"yes believe the reviews when you read them.. parking is horrific here.. make sure you have reservations before you go or else you will wait in line for a LONG time. I went here once to celebrate my wedding anniversary and our server was amazing and she even gave us cake to celebrate.. went again with my cousin for her birthday and this time, the service was not so great and we weren't given any dessert even though we were celebrating a 30th birthday.. I always have the same dish .. pistachio crusted salmon.... the first time I had the garlic mash it was beyond amazing but the second, I was not so impressed because the maple was overpowering and I couldn't really taste the garlic.. the scallops are really good and the garlic shrimp is good as well. not a steak girl so I cant comment but for a nice night out, its a good option so long as you make reservations!"}
{"text":"Large place, very busy in the evenings.  Food was not that good, and service was poor as well"}
{"text":"I've always had good experiences at this Keg with the exception of parking.  It seems to fill up right after work and on weekends.  It's super busy but I guess this should be expected as it's the only good steak place in the vicinity they I know of.  As for the food...they always get my medium rare steaks bang on, and they scallops and bacon are always delicious."}
{"text":"We came on wednesday night, was still very busy, we .had reservations and were seated right away, service was good, washrooms clean, drinks appitizers and entrees and deserts came ontime, steak was a bit chewy but I ordered well done, chicken creole was tasty. Drunk englishmen in next booth were a bit loud but they can't help thsemselves,"}
{"text":"A bit of a long wait to get a table but its all worth it. The Prime Rib with King Crab is awesome a bit disappointed how small the portion of the crab. But the Prime Rib... Beyond words.. Its good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed about the service. I booked a table for 7 pm at the restaurant the day before, but when I went in on the day, I was told that the reservation was for 7:30 pm. Although I understand that restaurants often have these mix ups and mistakes but the service I received was abhorrent. The hostess not only did not apologise about the wait but I was also faced with her unpleasant and very rude attitude when I voiced my discontent. While the food may be good, this type of service deeply affected my experience. I will definitely refrain from coming to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Great meal last night -New York steak was amazing.  One issue is, when your patron asks you to 'wrap up' what they have left on their plate to take home, do exactly that--and 'listen carefully when you are asked to ''please take everything'-- when you do not do this, this shows that you are not listening and you are assuming you know more than your guest!   I was very careful to say 'please take all of this and wrap it up'.  Next time, I will insist I wrap it my myself.  Other than this everything fabulous.    for Saturday, February 14, 2015"}
{"text":"My favourite for steak and lobster dinner and the miner pie is really good too."}
{"text":"The steak is delicious and the crème brûlée is fantastic."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing steak or prime rib, this is the place. I have been here many times and I am always impressed with the food and service. It's a great place for a night out and you can always count on having an amazing diner too."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Keg at York Mills and Leslie a few weeks ago on a Friday evening.   So it all started with a phone call to the Keg to inquire about reservations. The person who I spoke with was the kitchen manager Travis. Wow! What a friendly guy! Although we could not make reservations he was helpful in telling us the best time to come as it was a beautiful night and we wanted to eat on the patio.  When we arrived at the Keg Travis just happened to be at the host/hostess station and introduced himself. He took us to the patio and gave us our choice as to where to sit. Our service that night was top notch. We had exceptional service, the food was out of this world and we were so impressed with the cleanliness that this restaurant had maintained, as we could see how busy it was, with constant turnover. We are very picky about cleanliness and it is rare for us to dine out and not have to send something back that has not been cleaned properly, but everything just sparkled.   Our one disappointment-we were too full to try the Billy Miner pie, but we vow to go back one night for dessert as it looked delicious.  Thanks Keg for a great night out."}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful establishment. The service was excellent. Noticed a theme that the servers were mostly pretty women wearing short black dresses... Not a slight or anything. Just an observation. ;) Moving on! The food was expensive, but very delicious. I enjoyed a salad with tiger prawn shrimp added and a baked potato. All were excellent. The portions were very appropriate, and we sat at a table in the bar next to the fire. The ambiance was nice. A great place for a date, work dinner, or even anniversary. A couple next to us celebrated their anniversary and enjoyed a complimentary dessert which looked like an ice cream pie/cake dessert. It seemed to be absolutely scrumptious. Oh and the dinner mints are yummy! I grabbed several on my way out and enjoyed them for the next few days. hehe"}
{"text":"This location is always busy and for good reason, There were 3 of us for dinner. We started with drinks by the bar while we waited for our table, the staff at the bar were helpful and efficient and the ambiance good so we did not mind the wait.  Later, at our table we had appetizers which were excellent and ordered steaks. Although it was a very busy night, just before Christmas, our meal was served within a short period, the salads were fresh and crispy and the steaks were  tender and cooked exactly as ordered . We got the Creme Brule for dessert, it was the best I've ever tasted, simply delectable. Our server Mandy was great and so was the atmosphere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just called this North york Location at 416-446-1045 and was told i cannot make a reservation the whole day. I told the guy 5 minutes ago i spoke to a lady that i could book until 5:30pm. He told me well the lady who told you that must be misinformed cause she doesn't know how busy we are. I said well you guys should better train your staff because 5 mins ago you guys told me i can book and 5 mins later you are giving me attitude that absolutely you guys cannot book even before 5:30pm. this is ridiculous and the man who told me was very rude. Don't even have to come into the restaurant to learn your good training and customer service. I know I won't be going into this restaurant and obviously they don't need me as they are too busy"}
{"text":"I'm on the road 7 to 10 nights a month... And I can eat at any restaurant that I would like... I was hesitant to go to a chain like The Keg.  What I received with my guess was a delicious steak meal... I had a filet and my colleagues have the New York strip and we all started with the French onion soup and it was absolutely delicious...  The service was amazing and we had a bottle of the petite Syrah which was outstanding and very well priced  We have the cream Brulé for dessert and it did not disappoint... I honestly cannot think of going to another restaurant in the area... It was Wednesday night and it was pretty full.... I Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"it is advised to not come on a weekend unless you have made a reservation. Reservations can only be taken by latest 5pm for a later time otherwise it's first come first serve.  This is one of the busiest locations so look for a wait.  There are two different hostess. One for the dining side and another for the bar side. Go to the bar side as the wait list is way shorter and there's not much different with sitting in the bar area. You get a dining table and entertainment. The dining area is quiet and more intimate.   I ordered the prime rib and devoured the whole piece. It was perfect. I requested for the side to be the double baked potato. If you're going to The Keg then you must get the Double Baked Potato. You wouldn't be a true blogger if you did not. Delicious buttery and smooth mashed potatoes in a baked potato shell.  The service is amazing. They are very quick, accommodating and friendly.   Parking may be an issue as the lot is quite small for the amount of people waiting.  Watch out for the exit as there is no light coming into Leslie.  Not bad for a random night of steak."}
{"text":"This location offered everything I expect out of the Keg. We were celebrating our 4 year anniversary and the service was excellent. Our waiter said he also works in the kitchen so he was very knowledgeable about the menu. He was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Needless to say the food was spectacular. We both ordered the filet mignon and it was unbelievably tender and perfectly cooked.  They even surprised us with a complimentary piece of cake at the end. Great evening overall.   Only downfall... the parking lot is a nightmare. Always full. Park around back and walk a few minutes to the door."}
{"text":"So amazing. The baseball top sirloin is just amazing. Make it a classic and get the delicious Caesar salad or get escargot to start. Both very amazing!"}
{"text":"Was just ok.   The keg is generally great.  Consistent.  Known for consistent.     This one wasn't last time we went.   My steak was under done - never happens at the keg.  And it was tough and gristly.  Never happens at the keg.   Made me wonder if things are ok with the franchise.     Maybe time to find a new steak house."}
{"text":"The Keg at this location at Leslie and York Mills was one of the greatest dining experiences of ever going to the Keg. I always go to the one on York St. in down town Toronto and it was nothing compared to my experience at this location. So I made reservations at The Keg at Leslie and York Mills at 7:30pm. We did not have to wait for a table which was good since I already made reservations. My significant other and I were celebrating our third anniversary as being a couple and I passed my boyfriend a card I wrote.   We ordered the appetizer called the Neptune, and for entrées we ordered the 10 oz prime rib and chicken/ribs. The food was fantastic! No complaints about what we ordered. The only bad part was that we had to wait a long time for our bill to come. We asked our server named Echo if we could get the bill. Our server apologized that the bill was coming late and mentioned that there was a cake coming for us because she saw me pass the card to my boyfriend. She knew we were celebrating something. I was shocked because I never get free dessert even for my birthday! This was so amazing and the cake that came was this mocha flavoured cake with caramel and fudge drizzled all over the plate. It was so delicious! I never write reviews for restaurants myself but thought I had to share my experience so people will flock to the Keg on Leslie and York Mills."}
{"text":"Now I haven't been to many Keg locations, just the one at Yonge and Shep (now kaputz), one in Niagara Falls (great view), and the Keg Mansion (meh) but I do have to agree with Imran N., that this is one of the better Keg locations! Even when the Yonge and Shep location was open (and living 10 minutes from it by drive), my parents and I would still come to this location.  Intro. My parents and I came here early (5:45-ish) and were promptly seated in a booth (Yes...this location as booths!). From reading previous reviews, I stil question reservations, because we never have been able to reserve seats. It could be we do not know anyone there or we usually come for 3 seats (they may make reservations for larger groups). This is why my parents and I will always come early.  The dining area is VERY LARGE and they do have a bar area and a patio. I do agree with other Yelpers that the patio is a GREAT feature in the warmer seasons. One time we took some relatives out to dinner but could not reserve seats for 8 on the patio at 6:30pm, so my parents went there at 5pm to sit first, ordered many drinks and a bottle of fairly expensive wine and just sat until the rest of us arrived (needless to say, they were spotted easily a-la-red-tomato-face as booze tolerance level for my parents are -10). The staff didn't say anything nor did they require everyone to be there prior to seating. The manager even came out to ask us if everything was okay (they may have mistaken my mom's red face to be of anger...)  Food. My parents tend to order the Prime Rib, but lighter cut which means you get the fab meat at a smaller portion. Sides are asparagus and a take on fried onion rings which at times is crispy and cruncy all at the same time! You can also ordered a delish baked potato with everything on it *drool*  FYI. The onion soup is amazing here. My dad religiously orders the soup everytime he comes here. As a soup lover (as in my dad will have 4 large bowls of soup for dinner), he knows his liquids!  Pour moi, I was not that hungry so I ordered a salad with steak which is the best of both worlds: greens and some protein. I don't think you can ever go wrong with a salad, but the leaves are green and not filled with iceberg lettuce. Steak cut of 5-6 pieces are just right.  Service. Always been consistent, and we have come here enough times that some waiters remember that my dad likes his diet coke with no ice (that one guy was just exceptional in my mind). Always smiley and pleasant.  Parking can be a zoo during busy periods, but all in all, a great addition to the Yorkmills-Leslie area. I have to say the Keg is not the cheapest place to dine, however, well worth the value in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here during our anniversary and had a pleasure dinner with good food and excellent service. I recommend to book a reservation because this place seems always busy."}
{"text":"Blackened steak with shrimp was soooo delish, it of course melted in my mouth. Cooked to precisely med. Veggies were also perfectly cooked crisp. Service was timely and friendly. Nothing left on the plate. My go to for filet mignon."}
{"text":"To start off I am not a fan of the extremely dark lighting in Keg steak houses. While I understand dim lighting enhances appetite and creates a more intimate setting, there is zero natural light within the buildings giving it a depressing feel especially during the dead lunch hours.   Service was okay and nothing spectacular. I receive better service in grills/lounges. Water and drinks took a while considering the restaurant was empty. Our food also took an extremely long time & while the delicious home baked bread held us off...our order took around 30 minutes to hit our table. Really unsure how long we would have waited if the resto was in the middle of a lunch or dinner rush.   We ordered 3 8oz steak (rare-med/rare) and one fish and chips. The steaks were all cooked correctly to our liking. I recommend ordering your baked mashed potato double baked. Amazing. However if you do not eat pork they unfortunately DO NOT offer a no pork option for the double baked potato. Vegetables came in VERY little portions with 0 seasoning of any kind on it- super bland. Didn't expect much from the fish and chips (mom had surgery and couldn't have steak) and as we assumed, it was very mediocre.   Overall okay experience. If the steak weren't cooked as delicious as they were , I would not come back. The food keeps me coming here- please don't go here if you're looking for outstanding or fast service."}
{"text":"We go about 2x per year.  Yesterday it was my parents' anniversary and we were treated royally by server Dave, who was probably the best server I've ever encountered in my entire life, anywhere.  He even gave my parents an anniversary card.  We're never disappointed here, everything is always good, prices are acceptable (although they're always skimpy with their fries).  My only complaint was I got home to find that my doggie bag only had my leftover steak in it, all my veg and potatoes had been thrown away (so disappointed, that was going to be my next-night dinner, not sure why they did that), and, they really need to turn up the lights, especially in the bathroom hallway, its way too dark to the point of being dangerous.  Otherwise, we were happy as always."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to a steak night in North York last night and we were surprised by the good service and food that The Keg on Leslie had to offer.  Though it was a busy Saturday night, we managed to find parking and were seated within 10 minutes.  We ordered the escargot and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers, which were both delicious. I wasn't expecting the escargot to have southeast spices in the recipe which was a nice surprise.  The menu isn't very extensive but we enjoyed our entrees, and would recommend the Sirloin Oscar and the Prime rib.  For dessert we shared a fudge brownie, which was well worth it and a perfect way to end our dinner.  Overall a very clean and welcoming restaurant, with good service and good food."}
{"text":"Had a great time this evening. Have to give a big thank you to Nikki our waitress for ensuring our dining experience in the bar lounge was top notch. She's very polite and checked to make sure we were happy and made suggestions. Great personality and I would come back again hoping to have her take care of us. The appetizers were delicious. We didn't have dinner but if we did surely it would of been perfect. I'm never disappointed with the steaks. Always done the way I like. Chicago style med rare Filet mignon. I do go this location frequently and it's always a good experience. The dessert she recommended was really tasty. Brownie Sunday was perfect to share.  Thanks for a nice evening. I'll be back very soon. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Service and food was good but the weirdest thing that ruined all the atmosphere and service was that the hostess ladies kept walking around every 5 mins with an iPad and hovering over your table in what it seemed like calculating how many bites of food you had left. They walked by and stood beside my table at least 8-10 times while I was there. I felt like they were rushing and more concerned about flipping tables than having people enjoy the meal. It was 2 different ladies who did it the whole time.   Update: I got a call from the GM and he was very thankful for the feedback and wanted me to come in again and said he will make changes based on the feedback. Good customer service!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for my birthday and this was the first time I've ever been to The Keg. I made a reservation the day before because I didn't want to have to wait long on my birthday for a table. I arrived later than my reserved time but was told on the phone that they hold reservations for 15mins which was good because I barely just made it! I told them on the phone it was for a birthday celebration. When I got there I was asked to wait till they can seat me. Once we were seated, I asked for suggestion on drinks and the waiter was exceptional on explaining to me her favorites and also The Keg's specialty which was their \"FAMOUS KEG CAESAR\" and I got it \"Keg Sized\" which meant doubling the size (make sure to also keg size it, it's worth it). My mother got their special watermelon mixed with tequila (can't find the name of it) drink, it was from their special menu. Both were amazing drinks.   Between the drinks and ordering of food, the waiter gave us a great amount of time to talk and decide what to order which I appreciate because I hate when waiters come back so fast after serving the drinks and ask if we're ready to order. Since it was my first time there, I asked for suggestions on dinner choice and ended up getting the \"NEW YORK CLASSIC\" with Caesar salad and roasted garlic mash potatoes as side whereas my mother got the \"FILET CLASSIC\" with Caesar salad and mixed vegetables. The Caesar salads arrived first and it was a perfect size as an entrée, by the time we have just finished the Caesar salads our main course came, perfect timing. My mother and I both ordered medium rare for how we wanted our steaks to be grilled. Mine was a little overcooked than what I liked so I mentioned to the waiter that I think it was overcooked, she agreed and immediately suggested taking it back and switching it for me. I felt terrible having to waste it! But she insisted on switching and took my plate back. I thought it would take a long time for them to cook up another steak but within 10mins this other guys in a suit (I believe a higher level than the waiter) brought my dinner back and apologized for the inconvenient and said he will check back with me how it was in a few. I cut into it and it was perfect! Just the way I wanted and taste absolutely phenomenal. The Keg Classic Dinners are quite filling for one person but oh mind the potatoes and vegetables were prepared to perfection.  I couldn't even finish my dinner and had it packed to go! When the waiter brought me my dinner to take home, she also brought me their signature \"BILLY MINER PIE\" with a sparkler lighted on it to celebrate my birthday :) I was very happy that they were considerate of my birthday and served me that, it made my birthday memorable even though it was just a slice of ice-cream pie/cake! It was huge though so I shared it with my mother.  overall for my first experience at The Keg I would say they have made a great impression on me, it is a great place for special occasions or just a classic dinner. The servers there are tentative to your need and want to ensure you get the best quality of food. I would definitely recommend and go back again. :)  Thank-You to The Keg for celebrating my birthday with me!"}
{"text":"Came back here again, and the experience is as how I remember Keg to be.  Ok, maybe except that my usual Kettle Vodka Martini has increased prices again! LOL They now have two martini items: classic martini and a higher end martini, and the Kettle Vodka Martini is in the higher end martini. :(  Server Evan was amazing - very friendly, attentive and made sure we were happy the entire time.  My usual order of Rib Steak was exactly how I want it to be. Perfect chicago medium rare.  For the Billy Miner Pie, we asked to change the chocolate syrup (since we find it becomes too sweet) and replace it with more almonds instead, and Evan made sure that happened."}
{"text":"This is a great location, I've eaten here several times and each time has been great! The food is consistently cooked well and the service is great maybe once or twice I had a slow server or undercooked steak but they were quick to remedy any issues I had."}
{"text":"Nice respectable steak house  Pretty good food ( not like a Morton's or Flemings ) but respectable.  Service is ok  Decent steaks although they messed up on Med rare and had to cook again...really.  It's a steak house.  But the 2nd one tasted good.  If it were any other chains I would not revisit but the Keg has been around for a long time and not all the locations are the same."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere, delicious food, wonderful service. My friend and I both had New York steak with veggies and lobster tail and it was scrumptious! The cocktails could use a bit of work but they weren't bad, just a bit basic.   The vegetables were easily the best that I have had from a chain restaurant, great variety and well cooked. We also shared a fudge brownie for dessert, and I was planning on only having a bite since I was already stuffed, but it was fantastic so I kept on eating!   Highly recommend this restaurant for a date or special occasion."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Kegs in Toronto. Nice intimate setting inside and service is not bad. As with most Kegs, this place has a dimly lit \"romantic\" ambience. I've been here a few times and the quality of the food is pretty good.   My usual order is the prime rib. I like how it is always tender and juicy. I usually get it with a side of roasted vegetables. But it always come with lots of peppers, ugh. If I'm not diet-conscious I would get the delicious garlic mashed potatoes. The service was pretty good. The staff was quite friendly and courteous. The bathrooms were nicely decorated but had gotten a bit messy when I was there over the weekend.  It gets quite busy here on the weekend. The parking lot is pretty packed, you might have to park in the neighbouring industrial lots. Also beware if you come with a big party. One time with a party of 10+ with no reservations we waited almost two hours for a table."}
{"text":"I came to this Keg because it had one of the better reviews in Toronto, and because I had a gift card. There was approximately a 20 minutes wait when I went there for dinner. The entire meal was alright with fantastic service. I feel like the steaks were pretty standard and more on the rubbery side. However, portions are big!  Great place if you want good service in a romantic environment in North York."}
{"text":"I came here to take my boyfriend out for birthday dinner/goodbye for a year dinner.  It was a very emotional time at the restaurant but the staff were so lovely, they even let us move to a booth where we could sit on the same side.  They brought my boyfriend a delicious slice of birthday cake and the food was delicious.  The Keg is definitely very pricey but  it's so worth going to when you are willing to spend the cash.  I think it was the only place I could imagine taking my boyfriend for birthday dinner and a great romantic but not overly romantic place to go.   I'll definitely go back when I return."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food. Excellent help with parking when other patrons abused parking restrictions. The manager stepped in and made it possible for us (mobility challenged) to park right in front. Our waiter met all of our needs. Overall, we had a wonderful time celebrating my son's birthday."}
{"text":"Of all the Kegs this is THE best one. Steaks are always spot on and service always excellent.  I don't live close by but the reason we keep coming back is for the very fact that the steaks are so well cooked.   Let's start with well no pun intended the starters.  The tuna tartare on avocado is ok. The ahi tuna is fresh as well as the avocado, however it's lacking in some flavour. The tuna and avocado are both bland to begin with so a bit more acidity or soya sauce or perhaps wasabi is required to provide it that little kick. The tuna taco on the other hand is a bit on the spicy side covering the beautiful tuna.  The onion soup here is the best of all of the other Kegs as its not too salty and just cheesy enough.  The Caesar salads are excellent  The escargot with mushroom caps baked with cheese and spices come with some bread and the flavours are fairly well balanced.   On to mains. As I said all the steaks are spot on. We were told by the manager that there is one cook on the grill with roughly 20 steaks on at one time. He/she (I'm not sure) is able to keep all the orders straight always! I was so impressed. Some cooks can't even manage 2 or 3 and get it right.  Now this is a steakhouse so we really haven't had many other mains but on 2 other occasions we did order the black cod and the bass those were also cooked well not dry or over done.   As for desserts we're usually too full to get there, but I'll up date you Yelpers when I do manage to get there  The missing star is if I could only make reservations on weekends"}
{"text":"This restaurant, while usually outside my company's daily $ allotment for meals based on the items I order, has become one of my favorites and regular stops while on business travel to Toronto.  Service has always been excellent and food is delicious.  From fish, chicken and steaks, everything I've ever had has been cooked as requested and always leaves me wanting more.  They have an extensive wine list and servers are good at making recommendations.  This restaurant does not disappoint!  Can't wait for my next trip to Toronto in a couple of weeks as it's certain The Keg Steakhouse will be on my list of places to dine!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday with the kids...both have peanut allergies and the care they took to make sure what they ordered was safe is worth the 5 stars alone.  Our waiter even got the manager to come to reassure us which was a nice touch...rarely have that unless I'm at Disney.  Steaks were good...maybe a bit salty but that's a personal taste.  We were stuffed...  Kids were happy.   Thanks Keg!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Customer service is genuine. They want you to have a fantastic night and they go out of their way to make it happen. Very hospitable."}
{"text":"Another great experience at this Keg's locations. Once more, it pulls off the rare trio of great food, great service, and great atmosphere.   Walked in on a busy Friday night, luckily managed to get a table much earlier than anticipated. From the hostesses to the server, every one is very professional, friendly, knowledgeable.....and simply good at their jobs.  We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops for starters, which were pretty good. Scallops were cooked to perfection, bacon was still holding its own despite of the circumstances it had been forced to work under.  For mains we ordered one fillet mignon and one New York strip, both with garlic mash and some jus. Both steaks were cooked exactly as requested, and delicious. Cannot complain about any of the elements of the dinner. We always enjoy their garlic mash, and their quality of meat seems to be quite good. Food comes in fast and furious, as they want to turn tables quickly on busy nights. Our mains had arrived while we were still polishing off the appetizers, but that was alright with us...it wasn't obtrusive or pushy, and a quick turn around helps everyone as the walk-in queue keeps getting longer as the night progresses."}
{"text":"My family and I came here today for my moms birthday.   Parking was no easy task, I dropped them off at the door before taking on the mission. It took me around 15 mins to find parking. Meanwhile my server seemingly impatient serving my family that didn't want to order without me.   We're not gluts. The server seemed to be upset at us not ordering one appetizer, one main course and one dessert each person. When I cancelled an appetizer, she \"forgot\" about me cancelling it.  My mom had asked for sugar, our server brought over a plate of packaged sugar. My mom took one and said one is enough. Our server says \"not right now! \" in a rude manner.   Yes, they brought over a complimentary birthday cake.   Yes, the food was okay.   The overall experience was not up to standard though because of the poor service.   It's a Monday night, I can't imagine being here on a weekend night   Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"I've tried so many steak houses and The keg hands down has the BEST PRIME RIB! it beats even those places that charged double the price for the same thing (they charged double but was not even close to this) it's buttery smooth and melts in my mouth! the natural au jus is delicious and goes perfectly with the horse radish.   I love the salads, they are fairly priced and there used to be a bruchetta I loved but have seem to be removed from the menu.  I'm not so crazy with the sides that comes with the steaks, potatoes cooked in many different ways or rice or veggies. They need to have better sides selections and appetizers are a bit normal. I come her especially for the prime rib, I'm not that much a fan or other steaks, so don't ask me about those.   I had my prime rib with lobster before and they cook it really well and the butter goes on top of a candle to keep it hot, yummy warm butter on my lobster.  There's always line up here even on a monday night! For seats without waiting I suggest you come after 8:30pm. This location is pretty large, the service is very good, but the cleaning staff is really slow. I see many uncleaned tables while there is tons of people waiting outside for a table."}
{"text":"The food is OK. You can't go between 6:00 pm and 10:00 pm as you can't get parking and you can't get a seat. If you go around 4:00 then the place is empty and they want to seat you at the kitchen because they said a server is not available for the rest of the restaurant. This happened twice and each time we left. Don't go there any more even though it is 10 mins. away from home. What a shame!"}
{"text":"There are many restaurants that I continue to drive by yet never step foot into.   First dining experience here was on Valentine's Day.   I called a few days prior to make a reservation, but was told that reserving a table for Valentine's was not possible. A little annoying, but whatever. As we entered the Keg, it was jam packed with people waiting to be seated. We were told to expect a two hour wait, but somehow it only took twenty minutes before we were escorted to a table.  Service was fab. Food is your typical Keg fare, BUT I found the presentation of food to be quite nice. There's a good variety of wines. A bottle of Jackson Triggs was under $25 so not too expensive. Parking is plentiful.  This location will be my 'go to' Keg in the city.  Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I love the Keg on a whole and can always count on them for a great steak. That being said...I went to the Keg mansion downtown a few months ago and had the best steak I've ever had in life (Chicago style Rib steak Medium rare). I order the same thing every time I go to the keg and have realized now that it is very hit and miss. I went to this location last week and my Chicago style was not very Chicago and my steak was medium instead of medium rare. If this was Jack Astors or some other place I would let it slide, but I expect more from the Keg. But don't get me wrong, the food was still delicious and GREAT service.  Ask to try the 3 cheese butter with the bread that they bring out."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I came here earlier this year and thought the food was just alright. I ordered a medium rare sirloin steak, the steak came out rare (borderline cold to medium in temperature). I don't usually complain at restaurants but the rareness was too much. They cooked it for a little longer and the manager came out to apologies. I thought that was a nice gesture on their part. The veggies that came with the steak could use some sprucing up though, looked a little bare and cheap.   The second time I came here (last month), I ordered the blackened sirloin steak, the butter/spices drizzled on top was so so salty, I had to move it to the side.  For both occasions, I ordered the Bill Miner Pie for dessert and thought it was delicious!!! I liked the balance of the cake batter and ice cream. The only time I really come to Keg is when I get a gift card, I don't think I would come here if I had to pay for it out of my own pocket. On a side note, the customer service here is great, the waiters are super nice. Reservations are recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"Went to the keg for my Birthday wonderful as usual, we had the  Sir Oscar wonderful meal, so because it was my Birthday I received the Billy Miner dessert free, never tasted such a delicious dessert before Thank you"}
{"text":"Excellent location, food and service was very good even on a weekend Sunday right before Valentine's Day. The best KEG location I have ever went to."}
{"text":"I ordered the bone in rib steak and my husband ordered  the prime rib. My bone in rib steak was over cooked and they immediately took it back to make me a new one with no complaints. Everything was cooked to what I wanted at the end. Also, love the keg bread and it's unlimited!   Always a good time at the keg. Good service and good quality food."}
{"text":"We decided to pay a late visit tonight cuz we were kinda hungry but didn't want to go to our regular places.  They open till 10pm from Mon to Thursday and we arrived at 9:33 without reservation. We were seated within 10 minutes. We thought about going \"light\", ended up ordering from new summer Lobster menu.  Lobster gratenee, steak 8oz & half lobster, Billy's miner pie.   Everything tasted good except the long wait for the main course to be served and the lobster is a little \"lean\", my husband didn't quite like the steak (he said it's a bit rough) for me it's fine. Billy miner pie is delicious, hope they can create something similar to white chocolate Browne served in Moxie's.  Also the Watermelon mojito tasted like some \"rotten watermelon\".  Server was nice and patient.  Will come back regularly."}
{"text":"I always love coming here no matter what occasion.  Every time I step into the keg I always have a feeling that I am going to have a good time and it always is.  This time coming to the keg it was for a birthday party for one of my friends which we had a table of almost 12.   What I realized is that service is always really great no matter how many people are at your table.  They know exactly how to handle the customers at the keg.  Servers at this particular location seemed to be super friendly and super funny.  I always either order a New York steak or a prime rib and every time it comes out just the way I want it, medium rare.  Every time I feel like I want a big fat juicy steak without having to go barbecue it myself in my backyard I would come to the keg no questions asked."}
{"text":"Visited this location for a work event a few weeks ago.  Service was pretty slow - I don't think they anticipated being so busy on a random weekday afternoon.  Food was tasty. The garlic bread was a buttery indulgence and I loved my starter Ceasar salad, very good. For my main I chose the pistachio crusted salmon which was served with garlic mashed potatoes and bacon brussel sprouts.  Not the best place to visit if you are on a diet however if you are feeling decadent, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Here's another chain that I haven't been to in years and, coincidently, we came for another birthday.   We had the prime rib roast beef, rib steak and salmon. The prime rib (14 oz) was good but somewhat on the 'lean' side (ie 'dry'). Unfortunately they only had med-rare. Imo this cut should only be served rare. Otoh the rib steak was perfectly done with a nice sear on the outside and, at 20 oz, HUGE!  The pistachio crusted salmon was also nicely portioned and tasty.  Decor is 'comfortable', establishment clean, service excellent.   Overall pricey but pretty good for a chain."}
{"text":"By far the best keg location. Food is amazing and well seasoned. Last visit I had was last week, which only thing I could say was my steak was a bit chewy and dry, however didn't want to make a big deal. Noticed some parts of the steak was cooked more then I would like. Would prefer if it was more consistent throughout the entire steak. But overall good food and good service. Last visit I had with the keg at this location, I had no complaints and food was great and steak cooked to my liking. A con would be the parking...Always having to park in the far back."}
{"text":"My first visit to Toronto and was brought here for a business dinner. Even for a non-meat eater like me, the menu provided some great options! First of all, the bread was hot and fresh and delicious with a dab of butter! The spinach salad was great! A wonderful combination of fresh veggies, fruit and crunchy nuts! Big salad too! For my entree I opted for the mustard glazed salmon with steamed veggies. Perfect amount of food! Salmon was cooked perfectly, slight sear on sides, and perfect amount of the mustard glaze! I would highly suggest it if you are not a meat eater or not in the mood for steak! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Keg Locations in the past, and it's sad to say this is my worse experience at the keg.   I took my mother, wife and sister to the keg for dinner and was seated around 9:20pm. I understand that it was busy, however our waiter had kept pushing us to order as soon as we sat down. He had claimed that another big party was coming in and wanted to take our order in case he wouldn't be able to take care of us.. very disappointed when he said that.   As our server was taking our drinks order, my little sister told our waiter that it was our mothers birthday, he said thank you but never provided any birthday desserts for my mother.   I had order the king size steak, rare, it was really good. But it's sad to say that only my meal, the atlantoc lobster tail (our waiter never took our order for the lobster so we had to wait longer.) and the shrimp coctail was good. Both my mother and wife had ordered the prime rib and asked for medium rare but got medium instead. Both of their prime rib was extremely dry.  My little sister got the sirloin from the kids menu,  medium and it was also extremely dry. I had to give my little sister some of my steak because she was complaining about her steak being too dry. Our server never looked after us and I had to keep calling him to order appetizers since he rushed us to order our entrees.   All in all, I'm never visiting this location again. I go to the keg to have the service and food but was presented with nothing but a low graded service and food that was too dry."}
{"text":"Went to the Leslie street Keg for a Friend's birthday in the evening on December 28, 2017. I've been to this and several other Keg locations many times, including The Shoreclub. I was the last to arrive, much later than the rest. I was disappointed with the service I got. I had to request to see a menu. I had to flag the server to place my order. I inquired about the prime rib sliders, and was told that \"they're like little burgers.\" I ordered them, and they're actually little roast beef sandwiches.   When she put my plate down, she didn't ask if there was anything I needed. Turns out, I needed a roll up, and got one of the neighbouring (empty) table. Server did not do a quality check, and, as I only ate two of my three sliders, she brought me a box, upon request of course.   The aforementioned are basic steps of service. And I have never had anything but attentive service at a Keg restaurant. However, Toronto is an alleged world class city, but sometimes it seems that good service gets a pass.   I've been in service for most of my life, off and on, but it doesn't mean I tip liberally cause of that. Tips are earned, and many servers do not remember this. Tipping is not obligatory. One does not have to go above and beyond to earn a tip, but one should at least take pride and care in their work, and that should come through to the customer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very pleased with The Keg Steakhouse + Bar. We drove through the parking lot on Saturday night looking for a nice place to eat when we arrived at The Westin Prince Hotel for vacation and saw how busy they were so we decided to give it a shot on Sunday night instead. We spent all day Sunday exploring Toronto and asking locals what their favorite 'surf and turf' restaurant was and everyone seemed to recommend a different favorite. We decided to go with our gut and tried out The Keg. I ordered the Escargot as an appetizer and the filet with blue cheese/garlic on top, a side of shrimp and scallop oscar, and a baked potato. My boyfriend ordered the buttery garlic shrimp as an appetizer and the sirloin with a lobster tail, plus an extra lobster tail for his entree. Both looked amazing and tasted fantastic. Our server recommended the Billy Pie for dessert and that was light and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Rib steak was so so, pretty fatty cut with too many tendons. French onion soup and crab cakes was delicious, nicely cooked and served hot. However fare is quite pricey though."}
{"text":"The only reason why I would ever go here is because it is where my work has their Christmas party. It is just like every franchise out there. Boring, the staff seems like they want to be your friend, the meat is ok, the twice baked potatoes have no taste. Go somewhere else. If you want a steak there is an awesome steak house minutes away!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why I have not wrote a review for this location before?  Especially since I go here pretty regular, anyway. Let's get to it!  First off, this location is in the top 3 locations that do the best in all of Ontario and it surely does show it too!  There is usually always a wait for a table and depending on the night you may or may not be able to make reservations.  If you do not want to wait around for a table, which is usually 45-60 minute wait on a typical Friday or Saturday, come earlier than when you want to eat because by the time you end up getting a table, it will more than likely be when you are ready for your dinner!  So if you want to eat at 6pm, come at 5pm etc, you also may just be able to get seated if you arrive early as that is when the dinner rush starts to build up!  We usually always order The Keg Classic with the 7oz filet mignon. It can be a hit and miss, sometimes it is cooked to perfection and others it will come out not cooked at all! It really depends on the night, how busy they are and who is working in the kitchen.  If there is any issues, they are always more then happy to make it right for you!  With the opening of the new North York location, maybe we will see a slight decrease in how busy this locations gets, especially on the weekends!  PS. James is amazing and always gets things right. Some nights he is a server and others he is a manager!"}
{"text":"Last Thursday we had the best service at the Keg.. Our server was super attentive and a great sense of humour which made for an even better girls nite.  The steak caesar salad was perfect :)"}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience! The great thing about The Keg is that both the service and food are consistently good at every location I've been to.   My go to meal is the Mushroom Neptune starter followed by either the Filet Mingon or  the Blue Cheese Filet paired with a glass of red wine.  One of my life rules: \"always 'Keg Size' it!\""}
{"text":"Long wait (almost 50 minutes), but the service and food was great. Wife loved her fillet and peppercorn sauce and I highly recommend the onion soup."}
{"text":"I've been to this Keg a few times and nothing really stood out so I wasn't inspired to write about it, but this time was different. The food, as usual, was good but the service I have to say was exceptional; our server was calm, patient and genuinely happy to help us. I realised at that moment how accustomed we've become to rushed, frantic service. It was really nice to have somebody who wasn't running around like a headless chicken for once. She checked up on us at all the right times and took care of all of our requests promptly. This Keg is nicely decorated, like most of the others, and has plenty of free parking. The washroom was also very fancy but the soap dispenser at one sink wasn't working and the faucet at the other sink was broken and turned to one side but it was clean and all paper was stocked. It is a nice restaurant for romantic dinners if you can get a booth."}
{"text":"They overcooked my 20 oz. rib steak but immediately acknowledged and replaced it with what was likely a 30 oz. rib steak and didn't charge me for it ($40 menu price) and also comped me a pint of Creemore beer. Way above what I would expect from a restaurant in this situation. Everything from the wait staff to the management is first class here."}
{"text":"Actual Rating 4.5/5   Today was my first time at this particular location. Since I had made reservations, seating was seamless. I was in the restaurant and seated within 2 minutes. The wait staff were attentive, helpful and pleasant. I ordered the Teriyaki steak which was delicious and cooked to perfection (medium). Food got to us fairly quickly, I would say about less than 15-20 minutes from when we ordered. I also ordered the Creme Brûlée for dessert. Again, delicious. The only reason I left a .5 off this rating is because the parking lot is a pain in the rear. There are not that many spots and when I did end up finding one, it was all the way behind the building. Nonetheless, it was a good experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here to celebrate a birthday dinner and we had a wonderful time.   We were seated in less than a minute and our server, Taylor, was fantastic Taylor. He was extremely knowledgeable and recommended the rib steak medium rare and Chicago-style and for dessert he recommended the mocha ice cream cake which was to die for. The steak was perfectly cooked and charred to perfection.  I highly recommend you check this place out and if you're going to get a steak make sure you get it Chicago style!   I spend a lot of time in the United States and unfortunately many of the restaurants there don't know what Chicago style is so it is a fantastic treat to have it while I'm here.  Overall a strong 5 stars and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Keg I've been to by far. The service was amazing! I just wish i remembered the young mans name that served us. Very polite, checked up on us not just once, made sure our glasses are always full when it's near half empty.   The food is good as always. Was a little disappointed in the tuna tartar appetizer, I've had better. The calamari is to die for.   I had the New York peppercorn steak and it was cooked to perfection (medium) and can't forget about the best mash potatoes they have.   We were celebrating my boyfriends birthday and we had to leave at a certain time but that didn't stop the server from giving us a complimentary cake. Not sure what it was called but it was absolutely delicious. It was almost like a half ice cream half chocolate cake. Thank you!   Great experience and I love this location. I would definitely come back and recommend this location instead of the ones downtown."}
{"text":"Having a great time at the Keg. Good menu, great sides! So, many options for appetizers! Very good wine list. The servers are so friendly and knowledgeable.  Shannon is a wonderful server!"}
{"text":"I have been an avid Keg goer since my early 20's. I usually frequent this location, York St, the Mansion and the Scarborough location. Overall, I would say I've been happy over 95% of the times I've been in a Keg. Really great with customer service and have almost never dropped the ball.  Tonight was decent service. Inattentive would be the best description. Came in late after 11:00pm and wasn't acknowledge by staff at the bar even though they saw me. Took over 15 minutes for someone to come to my table and address me. It was not busy by any stretch of the imagination, still adequately staffed. What saved the review however was my server once she did come to my aid.   Initially tried the Black Cod, was pretty bland in my opinion (maybe I'm spoiled cause I usually get them at Japanese Izakaya's). She came back with a good recommendation for a New York (which I've never tried before, ONLY ever had the Rib-eye here) and replaced the Cod. Bang on.   Overall, I'm a fan of the keg, but probably of the 100+ times I've visited their establishments, this location would be the one to have let me down twice.   Gotta love that billy miner pie though!"}
{"text":"New York Striploin and double baked potato, never disappoint.  And still has the best escargot for me in TO."}
{"text":"Gotta love The Keg. What can I say....ordered the Caesar to start..extra hot of course. With the jumbo shrimp & house salad as an appetizer it's always a good start. The standard bacon wrapped 7oz Filet Mignon is always delicious. Chose the twice baked potato as a go with & a side of mushrooms. Yummy."}
{"text":"Went for a quick Valentines Day lunch. The food was well prepared and tasted delicious.  We didn't have to wait too long and our order was accurate. The waitress was extremely friendly and pleasant to deal with. My only complaint is that this location needs more parking."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice look and feel inside. It has a Texas wooden style to it with texas style service as well.  Great service, food was really good. We came here for lunch with about 6 of us and everyone was happy with their food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years and it's one of our favourite places to celebrate something! Always great service and food as one expect from a steakhouse. Their Billy Miner Pie is amazing"}
{"text":"\"If one is master of one thing and understands one thing well, one has at the same time, insight into and understanding of many things.\" - Van Gogh.  This quote perfectly summarizes the Keg experience; simplicity at its finest. The Keg brings your mouth through a series of stimulating orgasmic experience which will figuratively, but also literally, make you ejaculate...saliva.   Their rib-eye steaks are perfectly cooked, sealed and flawlessly charred; complementing its marbling. Their mashed potatoes are perfectly golden, without too much butter and balanced in saltiness. Their appetizers are fair in portion size and great in taste, each appetizer is created to compliment a selection of steak(s). Desserts are fresh and great in portion size, their cakes are to die for. Lastly, The Keg's unique and varied list of cocktails and wines are the perfect final touch to enhanced the already impeccable taste of their steaks.  The Keg is truly the Pietà of steakhouses, but unlike marble, their masterpiece of meat will melt in your mouth.  5/5"}
{"text":"By far, this is the best Keg out of the chain in Toronto.  The interior is excellent and the service is impeccable. The food is also the best amongst all the other kegs because it isn't as big and seems to have their timing down to a science.  Despite popular belief, you CAN make reservations, just not on the weekend.  The steaks are amazing and my favorite is by far the baseball (so thick it can only be cooked MR).  The keg is really all about value. you're getting amazing quality and service at very reasonable prices.  In summer this is a nice patio place to go to and is voted north yorks best patio. They also have fresh lobsters from halifaz during their lobster summer special, which is a great deal . 2lbs for a mere $40 or so!  The one thing that most people don't realize about the keg is their great deals on alcohol.  A double is only $7 and $10 for premium liquor. And all premium liquor is priced the same regardless of what it is. This is great news for ppl that like scotch! Whether its a16 year Laphroig or 15 year lagavulin, its the same price!! Compare this to other scotch heavy bars in toronto and you've found the best deal in town."}
{"text":"My favourite Keg uptown.  Free parking and the service is good.  They cater to my young kids and the prime rib never disappoints.  The only downside to this location is that they don't take reservations on Friday nights and weekends."}
{"text":"a nice dining place in downtown. steak is great. salad is ok, one pity is the fork found dirty. service is welcoming and nice. overall, a good place for steak."}
{"text":"Friendly + fast service Majority of the food was delicious and fresh! Minus the caesar salad - either the lettuce was soaking in water or the dressing. the salad tasted watered down, runny and gross.  Besides that, everything else was great. Will def return again!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this Keg! I have been coming here for years, and I love the new modern decor. It's really beautiful inside. Our server was so cute and friendly as well, it really does make all the difference when the person serving you seems to enjoy what they're doing.  I sat on the patio, which is also beautiful and quite spacious. I detest patios where your elbows are knocking into the table next to you because they've crammed too many tables outside.  I had the Chipotle Ranch Chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries...what a great choice. The chicken sandwich was delicious. It was on one of those dusty square buns, it wasn't MASSIVE where you feel ill afterwards from overeating...it was the perfect size. The chicken was juicy. My only complaint is that I ate it too fast. The sweet potato fries were average....they would've been nicer if they were crispy, but they were ok.  I love getting things other than steak at The Keg...I've not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Thank you to the The Keg for getting things right the first time! The atmosphere is warm and charming.  The service is prompt and stellar. The quality, the portions and the presentation of the food never ever disappoints!  I've been to several other Keg locations in an around the city - but no other compares to the the Leslie location - a huge round of applause for making every dining experience an enjoyable one!"}
{"text":"Here's the trick if you want to make a reservation, make it before 5pm for dinner. That way you won't have to wait at the door for a table. We came early for our reservation & were able to get a handicap parking spot right away. The waitstaff was good but a little distracted. I informed them that I have a dairy allergy & when I ordered a side of mushrooms they put cheese on it! But I asked them to send it back & they happily complied so I'll give them points for that. I ordered the filet mignon with garlic mash & it was delicious. I wish they had prime rib in smaller portions, I would have ordered that instead. It was super busy when we came on a Saturday night. Every table was full. We were seated at the back next to the kitchen so it was quite noisy. I think they should turn off the music. You can hardly hear it anyway over all the people in the restaurant talking."}
{"text":"The Keg locations are pretty consistant across the board. Very good steak and food in general. Expensive but good. You know what you are getting into when you go to any keg, this one is no different and that is a good thing."}
{"text":"One of the busiest Keg in the Toronto area. Since it's in a fairly rich neighbourhood, you will notice that you get very posh customers. They don't really take reservations, so be prepared to wait when here with a large group.  The service here is impeccable, ALWAYS.  The food here is GREAT. There are some Kegs out there that arent too great, but this location is one of the best. Whether it's the New York Strip, or the Prime Rib, or the top sirloin, or the filet mignon...nothing here is not good. Garlic mash is awesome, make sure you get that for a side."}
{"text":"Great service. However no bread. Poor management from top to bottom. Use to be able to get quality meal from this location. Now we can't even get bread. Come on son. Try another location. This is a miss."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference a drive can make! As a regular at The Keg on Markham Rd. I thought I knew what The Keg was all about.  However, tonight we tried venturing out to the Leslie location and I'm shocked at the difference in food/service/decore!   This location is large, fresh and airy, and OMG the quality of the food we ordered was 3x better.   Calamari is a large serving for $11 and included battered/fried jalapeños and red peppers. The Calamari was tender to the last bite!  Bacon wrapped Scallops, well how can they be anything but delicious with bacon!  Steaks were tender and cooked to perfection. The veggies included 1/2 a red pepper that was thick and juicy.   Our server was attentive and brought refills without being asked...do you remember the last time you had a server do that?  I don't.   Ample parking and a pager system for seating, the entrance and bar area were packed with waiting patrons.  Seems I'm the last to discover what a good location this is!"}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience during our dinner at this restaurant. The meals and service from our server were excellent from start to finish. Because of our business dinner, we were not paying attention to the menu immediately. Our server patiently explained everything we needed to know and informed us attentively to make a choice of our dinner.  Worth to note that our server neither got annoyed because we did not order our food quickly nor rushed us in any manner to get his job done (yes! we often receive server's attitude during business dinner that requires lots of talking.) In fact, he even repeated his explanation to our non-English speaking guests to ensure that they understand what they are about to order. At the end of our meal, during the clean up, our server accidentally spilled a couple drops of liquid butter on my uncle's trouser. He was very sorry about that incident and immediately self-reported that event to his boss. Rest assured 5 minutes later the manager, Ms. Biggs. She came to apologize to all of us and comped my uncle's orders. Not only that... Ms. Biggs came to our table the second time and handed my uncle an envelope that has a banknote in it for him to dry-clean his trouser. I have been living in North America for almost 14 years and the night we dined in at the Keg Steakhouse was the most memorable so far. Furthermore, our overseas guests were so deeply impressed with the honesty from our server and the professionalism of the restaurant manager. Before we left, my uncle handed in the banknote to our server as an appreciation his service and wonderful experience at The Keg. We felt cozy and surrounded by great energy dinning at The Keg. Definitely will return and bring more guests with us when we pay visit to this loving city, Toronto."}
{"text":"After trying a few of the better steak joints in Toronto, apart of me was afraid of eating a steak here. I love the Keg, i didn't want to spoil my affection for it so I only tried a few of the appetizers:  Brie Cheese;: accompanied with sweet pepper sauce and pesto and bread to dip, I would say this is the better baked bried cheese I've had anywhere else.  Scallop and bacon: Do i have to say anymore?  The bartender was kind enough to make me a drink that was not listed on the menu ! thumbs up for going above and beyond satisfying the customers!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite steakhouse restaurants in the city. The food is fantastic! All servers are trained professionally. Also it's a nice place for romantic dinner. Keep it up! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A good restaurant to get together with girlfriends.  The service was great but parking was really tough!"}
{"text":"Parking here is terrible.  Smokers outside the front door.  However, still a good place for steaks.  I ordered my usual baseball sirloin steak there and it is still as yummy for me for the price as ever.  I SO MISSED EATING A PROPER STEAK after months of just cheap HK diner steaks it's nice to have at least a Keg level steak that's cooked medium rare Chicago style.  I think I had a slight cold though so it probably didn't taste as good as I remember, but most of it still went through.  They are still very particular about being 100% satisfied, but I don't like abusing that privilege they offer me.  I like that the lighting isn't as dark as some of the other Kegs too.  I do enjoy seeing my food.  However, since parking here is terrible, I would not go to this location voluntarily again in the future unless it's some off peak hours (does Keg even have off peak hours?)  One thing I would do in the future is to probably ask them for a recommendation so I can have something other than baseball and their prime ribs."}
