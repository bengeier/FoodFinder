{"text":"We enjoyed our first dining experience at Okra's Cookhouse & Cocktails from start to finish!   The atmosphere was loud and friendly, the food, and especially our server, Morgan were wonderful! The menu offers a nice choice of very flavorful, Southern comfort food made with a variety of ingredients that heighten the food far from average. Southern food with a twist- far different from our South West flavors of Arizona.        Because my wife and I didn't recognize some of the ingredients and descriptions on the menu, we called our server over. She was extremely helpful and friendly- that Southern hospitality we've all heard of and is so sorely missing in most restaurants these days. In fact we spoke with three servers and one of the cooks (we were seated at a tall table, near the kitchen window)      We enjoyed our food immensely, it was very fresh, flavorful and portions were generous. We plan on going back-there are so many more starters, entrees and deserts we're looking forward to trying!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  It smelled awesome and we don't have many southern food concepts here. The service was sloooowwwwww.  Was seated and it took 20 minutes to get a drink. Not many patrons dining  on a Thursday night at 7pm, which can be a bad sign. Literally only 4 tables filled and few people at the bar. Staff seems inexperienced. Friendly, but not with it. Received the wrong starter. Fried chicken was ok and overpriced for sure. After all, it's fried chicken. Grits were disappointing and needed hot sauce. I lived in the south and this pales in comparison to the worst places I've been. I suggest the chefs go back and gain inspiration to update their recipes or improve kitchen quality. You're missing a lot of opportunity."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Very comfortable and great hospitable service.  Everything was great... . Fried Chicken Skin . Tomato heirloom salad was SUPER tasty . Biscuits were supper buttery . Corn bread was yummy,   I had the Pork Cheek Pot Pie, mmm.   My wife had the Fried chicken and was SO good!   The braised beef was TENDER.    Drinks went perfectly with our meal.  I had the \"fresh\" grapefruit vodka drink.  My wife kept getting the \"bartender's\" choice.  She loved all three of them!    We finished off with the donut dessert which was to \"die for\".   NO QUESTION... We will be back."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere were great. The food was mediocre. The fried chicken sandwich was pretty flavorless. However the shrimp and grits was delicious!! That was the best thing we tried there."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, but the food was disappointing (bland, not special) and the acoustics were terrible. At a table of six, we had to shout to hear each other."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Awesome service. Ask Megan to make fun of anyone you want and she'll do it! :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the mix of southern and Italian food. Impressive happy hour menu too. Service was outstanding as well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a mid week date night. The staff was very engaging and attentive. We started with the Crispy Chicken Skins covered in a sauce that is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy which balanced out the fatty goodness of the skins, along with the Calabrian Pork Bites and Greens. I'm not a super big fan of greens but the crispy chunks of pork combined with the slight bitterness of the greens was delightful, I could have eaten an entire plate of them. For my main I had shrimp and grits from the restaurant week menu. Nice creamy grits and perfectly cooked shrimp is always a winning combination in my book. For dessert I had the Canned Biscuit Doughnut cover in salted caramel sauce which was as awesome as it sounds. My boyfriend had the Derby Pie and was in love with it, in fact if pressed to choose between me and that pie I'm not entirely sure I would have been victorious in that situation. We left with the agreement of putting this one into our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the 7th St. Corridor, but food was overpriced for what was served.  I got the pimento cheeseburger and it was OK.  Frankly, I think Short Leash has better pimento cheese.    While the food was mediocre, the drinks were great.  A lot of great varieties and twists on some classics.  Think this is more of a great spot to grab a drink during HH or before dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"While I so wanted to love Okra, I unfortunately did not. Let me start on a positive note - I love the decor, the waitress was a total sweetheart and the fried chicken skins were excellent. However, we had some problems with our cocktail, which were never remedied. My husband, a regular vodka drinker, ordered a vodka/soda. When it arrived he took a sip because it tasted funny and asked me to taste it. I tasted it and sure enough noticed exactly what he was talking about - it tasted like tequila mixed with vodka. We informed the waitress and requested a fresh drink and she said others had complained of the same problem, but that she thinks it's just \"the type of vodka they use.\" (The bar uses Titto's vodka, which my husband has had many times.) The waitress replaced the cocktail anyway and brought a fresh one, but when we tasted that one, it again tasted like tequila. My husband (who used to work in a bar) notified the waitress that the bar tender was likely not rinsing the measurer between measuring different liquors and she assured my husband that he does. Since were were sitting near the bar we were able to watch the bar tender make drinks and saw firsthand that he was definitely not rinsing the measuring cup between liquors and confirmed this was the cause of the tequila vodka soda. Since tequila has such a powerful flavor, it was finding its way into our vodka soda every time. We paid for the drink, but my husband could barely drink it. Now, onto the food - we ordered a seafood special which they offered for the evening. It consisted of five shrimp, some mussles and two oysters, along with a piece of bread and some pickled green beans. The cooks forgot to include my oysters along with my meal and they also left an item of another gentleman's dinner at my table. But the worst part of it was that the mussels were slimy and undercooked. I didn't send it back and just kind of stomached what I could and put aside much of it, because we had already complained about the drink and I didn't want to be \"that customer.\" Like I said, I wanted to love this place. I'm hoping for their sake they were just having an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and beer. First time in. Pretty dead at 5pm on Monday, but hey, it's Monday. Always slow in the industry on Monday. Service was great and the first and for most think I observe when I walk into a new place. Ordered the BP Pineapple Sculpin and the smoked wings. Delicious! Wifie had the Brussels sprouts and  fried chicken skins (covered in honey). Sprouts I liked; skins are not our jam. Good vibes though and some cool overhead music. Nice decor in the bar too. It's also a full bar for those hardcore shot drinking drunks. I'll be back at some point for dinner. In the meantime, this crew deserves a 5*"}
{"text":"I recently ate at Okra Resturant. I had been meaning to stop in as I had heard great things about their food. The wings were different but good. I really like there mac and cheese balls. They were awesome. Most importantly the food was good.   My battery was low on my phone and it was taken to the bar to recharge. Our server took extra care to ensure my phone was put in a safe place. I was not sitting at the bar so I was concerned to let it out of my reach. Phone returned charged. Those little things matter to me. An overall good experience!"}
{"text":"I own a home in the Charleston, SC area  and really know good Southern food.  This is really bad Southern Food accompanied by a NASCAR induced soundtrack mostly containing Lynrd Skyrd.  It wouldn't last for six months in the deep south."}
{"text":"We wanted something different, Okra delivered! The service was fantastic, the food really really good. Because of medication I'm taking, the mixologist came up with a NA Mocktail that was GREAT! Had two of 'em. The place would have received 5 stars, but it was hot in there. July in Phoenix, go figure. The table top was sticky, a simple wipe wasn't going to fix that. All 4 of us had something different, all 4 entrees were great. We had lotsa appitizers, all delicious. Just couldn't bring myself to sample more that a bite of the fried chicken skins. Good, but so is a deep fried twinkie (I imagine). And then the donut. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! We will be back, just not in the summer. Great job. BTY, this is my 1st restaurant review ever."}
{"text":"Basically, not ready for prime time.  To start, if you are going to launch with a series of complex cocktails then you better be prepared to have enough bartenders to handle the business.  Because when you have a place that is 80% capacity and they are ordering drinks that are complex then bar service becomes slow.  Ridiculously slow.  Then there is the over-attentive wait staff.  Please, just give us a minute or two when we ask to give us a minute or two.  Then, there is the food.  The food is fine and presented well.  But that's just it - it was fine.  The chicken was OK but bland, the meatballs were just meatballs.  I'm trying to recall the appetizer as it was the best thing we had - hush puppies w/goat cheese.  Look, I'm all for big experimental ideas, but I do insist that they are executed well.  This just wasn't ready.  Too bad, because I like Crudo."}
{"text":"Okra is amazing! Great location wonderful ambience and delicious food. We tried the fried chicken skins,hoecakes and  Calabrian pork bites, all were delicious and perfectly prepared. Next was the Fried chicken Tennessee style and meatballs with polenta which I would definitely order both again.  We ended the meal with the donut with salted caramel sauce absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Not only was everything we tried on the menu delicious, but the cocktails were AWESOME!! The atmosphere is inviting, casual, and kid friendly. What more could you ask for? We will be back!"}
{"text":"Completely delicious, creative, and fulfilling! As a Phoenix native I am happy to experience the food scene transformation of the valley and places like okra make me appreciate how far it has come.   The cocktail list is uniquely perfect for its theme and I look forward to my next visit to try something new. The food menu is equally important with well crafted small plates and entrées. As a \"vegetarian\" (who eats fish and on occasion will try the meat fat soaked side dish) I give this place a raving review. While the menu at okra has limited options for the strict vegetarian, you won't be disappointed by flavor profile of the dishes that are available to you. I had the cat fish with okra succotash: perfect. My boyfriend had the ham hock which he completely annihilated! And you have to try the pie for dessert! We had coconut cream pie and I could have had the entire piece to myself.    Bottom line is if you are a foodie, like southern style food, and are willing to try something different then head to okra for a fun, trendy and unique meal!"}
{"text":"Great food and Dan, the manager, is amazing. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight right before last call. I work in a bar right down the street and wanted to come and see this place, since it really isn't even open yet. The staff was wonderful. Sat at the bar with my friend and had great conversations with the bartender Andrew. The manager was also super nice and chatty. The food was outstanding and we  really enjoyed the Beaujolais we ordered. Fried chicken is amazing and the cheese balls were heaven. Just make sure to get the canned biscuit doughnut. It's everything."}
{"text":"I'm am still in disbelief at noon today and truly disappointed with my culinary experience at okra last night, valentines evening. I had reasonable expectations of a good, not great, but simply good evening with good food for me and my lady. I figured a little comfort food, Southern cooking you really can't go wrong unless you just never cooked it and even then a misstep is still a tasty event. My bill was 101.00 and I left a 15.00 tip. I support our servers as long as they act like they care. The food was not homemade, it was definitely frozen, box prepared and arranged on a plate. Salty doesn't begin to describe it and I saw a lady actually sprinkle salt on her food..amazing! The drinks were stuffed with crushed ice to save on the alcohol making you think you got a full glass. Folks I'm sounding bitter about this and I am...this was totally unacceptable. If you think the name okra which should signify a sense of southern pride and some confidence about what kind of food you'll get, rest assured you can get much better at Popeyes or kfc. Shame on you Okra, go back to the drawing board, you will be out of business shortly serving this overpriced garbage..sorry but it's true. Find a couple of cooks who can actually cook for you...this was not good at all. I can't be the only one...4 stars is pumped up by the employees and friends...food not good..never again and I will tell everyone I know, don't waste your money and create this emotional baggage, I'm scarred...seriously. 1 star for the service."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last weekend. Food was overpriced and frankly not very good. Small portions and unimaginative. Hush puppies were dry. The Cesar salad was 8 romaine leafs with a little Cesar sauce. Worst of all the beer wasn't cold."}
{"text":"I hadn't heard about Okra until I saw a mention on AZ Wilderness' Instagram about their delicious fare, after looking at the menu I knew I had to go stat and last night I was not disappointed.   I got the Okra cup cocktail with housemade Pimms, strawberry, cucumber, lemon, and seltzer and sucked it down in short order. We got a bunch of small plates. The fried chicken skin was a little too spicy for my lightweight palate but the other flavors in the dish held up to the heat very well. The mussels, oysters, and bone marrow plates were all glorious. The lemon pie was a great tart finish after the richness of the meal.  The service was perfectly on point. And our food came out SO fast, I realized I should've ordered our plates one or two at a time (the place was about 3/4 full at the time.) I wasn't careful in ordering so we ended up getting some kind of bread with all but one of the plates, I was so starry-eyed over the headliners I didn't think about the supporting acts, I'll pay more attention to balancing what we order next time so we don't carb-bomb ourselves again.  I loved it at Okra Cookhouse! Seriously drool-worthy!"}
{"text":"The catfish was really delicious and it's nice to see a non-southern venue try and attempt cuisine from the east coast. The country ham seems more like prosciutto and I'd like to see them give you a basket of hush puppies like a real calabash spot, but, all in all- pretty darn good."}
{"text":"rewarding find for more adventurous eaters, and modern versions of classic dishes. try the red pepper oxtail jam if they have it on apps, and donut in a can for dessert."}
{"text":"Crispy fried chicken skins with a sweet honey glaze. Dates with a mild sausage and basalmic. A perfect fried chicken with homemade Louisiana hot sauce...just enough tangy to go with a mild heat. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy. Pot pie is very rich. Bone marrow with a oxtail jam and a perfectly made sweet biscuit. All of the breads were amazing. Surprised they make several variation of their biscuits in-house that come with different plates. Drink menu is as good as it gets. A wide range of juleps, a full list of classic cocktails, and a list of newer drinks.   It's small, but the ambiance is great. Very cool lighting with open viewing of the kitchen, which is neat because there are several wood fired grills cooking the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the perfect storm of dining experiences. I love their take on southern cuisine and they have great hand crafted drinks. This is one of those places where you can ask the bartender to make you a drink that's kinda like this or that and they will nail it every time."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most amazing first (of many) experiences here! Maureen and Frances went out of their way to have the chef make a custom tasting menu for my husband's birthday and every plate was phenomenal. Ty was our server that night and was so knowledgeable and clearly passionate about what he did. The cocktails were very unique, well executed and most importantly delicious. Oh and the ambiance was just great. I recommend this to anyone regardless of style of taste, you will find something you like. You can't go wrong when genuine people are living out their passion!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed to find some menu items missing. Overall, good meal (TN Hot Fried Chicken). My wife did not like."}
{"text":"What happened? I remember coming to this place for the first time and it was filled to the brim. Food was excellent and service was spectacular. A highlight being the fried chicken skins. Well...not so much this time round. A very clear indication of our not-so-good time was an almost empty restaurant, odd seeing how it was a Friday night. The food was bland. Their current menu, lackluster. They removed a lot of great dishes, like the Ham hock, and replaced them with \"I could get this anywhere else\" dishes. Service was awful. The server was arguing with another co-worker. They ran through their supply of soda for the night, which we were comped for, the server ran through and poured what was left into our cups, letting us know all the while (we were not offered something else to drink). Our food came out at odd times and we were left alone, no check ups on refills or a \"how is the food?.\"  We had ordered some other drinks when our server happen to walk our way....actually glad she forgot someof our order, considering how everything tasted. Hah, nothing could redeem Okra that night, not even the chicken skins."}
{"text":"What kind of \"southern\" themed restaurant doesn't serve sweet tea? That should have been the first clue we were on a path of disappointments. The apps were mediocre, however the \"fried pork skins\" were questionable and seemed familiar with the type you get a gas station in a bag. The shrimp and grits were by far the worst, grainy, undercooked and fishy. The fried chicken and whipped potatoes were the hit of the evening, and that's not saying much. We told our server the grilled chicken was dry and inedible, she practically shrugged her shoulders and walked off. We will stick with Cracker Barrel, at least there you get good service and decent \"southern\" food! Stay away."}
{"text":"Hey the food here is pretty good; no complaints w/ anything quite frankly. Fried chicken skins good but that's a PHX idea of Southern?  The drinks are bomb and the bar is a great accompaniment, I must say.  However; I'm from Virginia, and this food is about as Southern as Republicans are to democrats.  Will still pine for authentic Southern food here, other than Mrs.White's and her over priced menu."}
{"text":"If this place was in the south, it would be out of business in six months.  Let me start by saying I'm married to a southern boy and I lived in the south for 10 years. With that, when I found Okra's website via a search on Yelp, I thought it was the perfect place to take my visiting mother-in-law (also southern) for dinner. Reservations were for a Friday night.  First, Okra's website REALLY does it justice, more than it deserves. The site makes the restaurant seem warm, urban with a down home spin. The ambiance of Okra is the same as so many other restaurants in Phoenix--trying too hard to be hip with questionable architecture and poor lighting. Not to mention, most of the \"standard\" tables are right in front of the door, which on a cold and rainy night, sends a draft through the space every time the door is opened.  The service was adequate, but not what you would hope for. Our server was okay, but aloof and extremely inattentive. She never checked on whether we liked our food or if we needed anything else during the meal. We were nothing more than a table and tip. At least try and fake it!  As for the food ... the worst part of the entire Okra experience. I ordered the 2-piece regular fried chicken with hush puppies (you have to pay extra for every side, otherwise, all you get is the chicken), my husband got the chicken sandwich with fries and my mother-in-law got a cabbage salad with a side of corn bread and grits. The fried chicken had absolutely no taste. And what I believe was supposed to be a breast had almost no meat on it at all. I mean, when the leg has more meat than the breast, there's something wrong. Frankly, they should be ashamed to even serve a piece of chicken like that. The hush puppies were okay, but there was absolutely no presentation to the plate--just two pieces of over-fried chicken on one side and three plain hush puppies on the other. The chicken sandwich was okay, but extremely messy. As for the grits and cornbread--come on Okra, really? The grits were waaaaaaay too thick and why is it that you burn the edges of your cornbread? I can assure you that is not how it's done in the south.  The best part of my meal was the Okra Cup drink.   Just because you name yourself after the most famous vegetable served in the south and put some wood up in your restaurant does not mean you can legitimately call yourself a fine purveyor of southern cuisine. Okra, you have a long way to go. I suggest a long trip through the south to learn from those more concerned about quality and taste than trying to be yet another hipster wannabe eatery in Phoenix.  Perhaps my perspective is a bit skewed, but if you are looking for good southern cuisine, Okra is not place."}
{"text":"Megan was awesome and made our night! Great drinks, funny service. Good times. Great oldies."}
{"text":"Last minute decision to get some drinks with hubby and this place absolutely hit the spot.  The bartenders are great and they are mixologists and make bartending a complete art form.  The cold brew cocktail was amazing and hubby's old fashion was great also.  The menu is very southern, although we only tried the fried pork rinds to munch with our drinks, which by the way was perfectly cooked. It was worth my cholesterol going up.  Can't wait to go back and eat the food."}
{"text":"Recently tried out this restaurant on a very rare date night between my husband and I.  When you have a new baby, you really value the time you get out, so you want the experience to be good and worth your time.  I wish we would have chosen another restaurant.  I'm giving a 2 because 3 meant A-okay and I can't say that it was.  The drinks were great and of everything we consumed, they seemed to be made with the most care and consideration.  The ambiance was horrible.  The lights were up as high as they could be and I just didn't understand why they wouldn't turn them down.  All of the tables had candles, so it seemed they would regularly turn down the lights, but when we asked our waiter why the lights were so bright, he simply said, \"I couldn't figure out the light switches.\"  Seems like a ridiculous reason to ignore this important aspect of dining.  I actually asked twice because it was so distracting to me.  He seemed annoyed by me wanting a more romantic setting. The ambiance is a huge part of enjoying a meal and we felt like we were in an operating room with the lights so bright.  Made us question their intentions with keeping the feel so sterile.  We started with the brussel sprouts.  While the tiny bit of lamb that came with them was tender and mouth watering, the brussel sprouts were not cooked enough and were so difficult to eat, I only had one of them.  They were barely cooked.  Very disappointing.      Having lived in the South for many years, I have a soft spot for fried okra, so was really looking forward to trying it.  Unfortunately, it did not compare to previous okra dishes I've had and again, I was disappointed.  The okra really didn't seem to be cooked through and, while it should melt in your mouth, it was hard and chewy.  It was also flavorless.  The chicken was underwhelming, and I feel it should have knocked the socks off any cheaper fried chicken available to the average person, especially for the price.    The waiter was good for the most part, but after he made us feel crazy for wanting the lights to be less glaring, I didn't feel comfortable sharing my feelings about the food.  We noticed that lots of people who seemed like regulars were getting the chicken sandwiches.  Maybe that's the better option?"}
{"text":"The food here is presented in a simple manner, but it's al full of flavor. It all comes from a menu that presents itself as a guide to classic southern cooking with an Italian flare. The cocktails are unique, tasty and backed up by a well supplied bar. The surroundings have a modern/feel that compliments the food nicely. All around, an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Good. After a little confusion finding the place we were greeted by the excellent staff. We tried the delicous wings app which had really interesting flavor. The dougnut was great as well. Burger was pretty good as were the super fatty chicken skins. Pizza w/ sausage and hot sauce and the cornbread were just okay. The hush puppies had no flavor but still edible. No plans to return but it was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Okra?  Handcrafted cocktails, friendly service and the skins with honey hot dipping sauce are the best.  Took my sister here for the first time last summer when she came out from Jersey to visit.  As soon as I picked her up from the airport for her recent visit she said you gotta take me back to get more of those skins!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant while making a u-turn on 7th Street and what a lucky break it was.  This is a special place.  If you love southern food it's a special version of it.  And if you don't that's ok too.  The menu has lots of unique entrees and you're bound to find something you like.  Staff is fun and informative.  Can't wait to try the patio when it cools off."}
{"text":"I wanted to leave 4 stars, but I can't!  I wanted the pretentious bartender to give me a reason to rate Okra lower, but his cocktails surpassed my expectations and left me thoroughly satisfied.  My fried chicken skin appetizer was better than I could have imagined, and the pig cheek pot pie made for the best food I've ever taken back to a hotel room.  I like this joint, and I think you will too, or I wouldn't have wasted my time on a review.  If any of you that served me tonight read this, thank you!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous. I got the fried head cheese, bone marrow, and ham hock, and it was beautiful.  My girlfriend got the fried chicken skins (fantastic) and hen, which was like a chicken and dumplings. Both were really good. The drinks... ridiculous. The juleps were great, particularly the champagne julep, they have an actual vieux Carre, the new gothic is one of the best spirit-forward drinks I've had in a good while.  The server, Angela, was very attentive and I could not have asked for better.  And... to top it off... someone dropped some glasses and they broke and no one clapped. If you are the guy that claps when that happens, please don't come here. You're a douchebag."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place after recently moving to the neighborhood. Service was a little slow getting started considering it was not super busy on a Monday night but I must say the wait was worth it. The braised beef dish was perfect and the broccolini cream sauce tied it together nicely. Good happy hour deals on apps and drinks. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place was delicious except for the 2 inch breading on the fried chicken. We ordered the fried chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and collard greens. For appetizers we ordered chicken skins, shaved cat fish and biscuits with apple butter. The appetizers were great, the shaved catfish dish was small catfish pieces served over a bed of fries with a relish on top and paired with hot sauce and hot sauce aioli. The chicken skins were nice and crispy served with a honey butter sauce that added a nice sweet aftertaste. For the entree we ordered a 3 piece fried chicken dinner. The chicken was moist and cooked perfect but as I stated earlier the breading was a bit much. It's definitely doubled battered before frying because the breading was so thick but the seasoning and taste was on point. The best part of the whole meal was the dessert, we ordered the can donut with salted caramel sauce. This was So delicious I wanted to order a take home box of it. The caramel sauce paired perfect with the dough and it was still crispy covered with the sauce. I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour drink specials.  Love the wings.  The chocolate pecan pie was fantastic.   pThe char grilled oysters were small and over priced, even for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio.  Food- if you love vinegar you'll love this place. You will likely leave very thirsty between the mosh mosh salads and salted breaded everything.  Again,  Nice patio so if you're looking for a place to hang and visit and food isn't a priority this is the place."}
{"text":"It was good but did not quite live up to the hype I saw about this place. Cocktails were definitely 5 stars but I thought food was excessively pricey for what it is. We had many of the starters they are known for: chicken skins, chicken wings, etc, and they were good but we were not blown away. Muscles were exceptional, in savory broth, but I did not like the corn bread on bottom as it was extremely soggy from sitting on broth. I would suggest presenting the corn bread separately and allowing guest to dip themselves if they so wish. Main dish was ok, potatoes with a pice of beef roast on top. Nothing wrong with it, just something I could find anywhere. Other people in our party had fried chicken and thought it was ok, not exceptional. Towards end server seemed rushed to get us out of there. Lots of people waiting by bar, who seemed to be regulars there, so got the feeling they wanted to pass our table to the next people."}
{"text":"Modern down south soul food with a twist. I'm happy to say it's not just chicken and waffles.  If your ready for some comfort food that doesn't put you in food coma then this is the place. I recommend the fried chicken skins to start. The pig cheek pot pie was seasoned and fabulously textured with simple additions of carrots and diced onions. The crust was amazing on its own! The deep fried doughnut was crazy good..! Heading back for sure."}
{"text":"Is okra visually stimulating and fresh? Yes. It has a nice inviting decor in a newly redeveloped north central building.  But my new rating guide is by asking one question: did i eat anything that i want to go back for. Unfortunately  with a party of 5, nothing we had was memorable.  Although not perfect but the service is good and personable. It is the food. Using southern dishes and trying to refine them and charge higher price for a refinement that actually basterdises the great cheaper igredients such as catfish, bone marrow, grits, ham hock, does not work. Almost everything is sweet,  from the tomato base of the small meatballs, to the base of the short rib and even the muscle broth.  And stop messing with the bone marrow by adding jam. Bone marrow does not need make up.  Good atmosphere, but another failure of creating memorable food."}
{"text":"Our first impression was that the space was quaint and trendy. Made a reservation and upon arrival they looked at us like we were in the wrong place. The square footage is small and luckily only 3 tables had patrons. That should have been our initial sign. I looked at the beer menu and questioned the server who knew absolutely nothing about the hops or overall lightness of the selections. I asked if he could find out since I like beer but am not a fan of ones that have tons of hops. Believe me, I am not hard to please in the beer category. I ordered the Pilsner. Good choice.  We started with the fried chicken skins. Definitely, way overpriced for 4 skins that I normally would throw away or take off my chicken before cooking. Next, came the entre. The 3 piece fried chicken meal for $20 that came with ONE side. We chose okra and paid for an additional side of greens.  The chicken was mostly skin and batter and definitely not worth $20. The okra was really good. The greens had absolutely no flavor.  Our server told us after delivering our meal that the cornbread was still heating. 5 minutes later he said he was mistaken. Cornbread did not come with the meal. One would think they could throw in a few pieces of cornbread. Right? While we were still eating, the server attempted to take away our side dishes that were not finished. Sort of rude. Maybe he was trying to be punctual in his table clearing, but not while a patron is still eating.  When we were finished, he promptly brought us our bill. We paid and are NEVER going back. The food is too expensive for the quality and amount you receive. We were under wowed on so many levels. The only reason I am giving it 1 star is, that is the bottom of the review barrel. Go somewhere else for more authentic down south food."}
{"text":"The food was very fun!! Appetizers were fried chicken skins and hush puppies. I preferred the hush puppies with cucumber and goat cheese.  The short rib was yummy as meat very tasty and tender. I enjoyed the  pork pot pie.  The pork was tender and seasoned with great crust.  Our server, Morgan, really made the dinner special. She is knowledgeable about the menu- made great recommendations- and very engaging."}
{"text":"I went with my friend to celebrate the ending of our first semester teaching! Our server was outstanding. She was happy to answer any questions we had. We really enjoyed our cocktails which my server recommended. I ordered the fried chicken spicy. It was very flavorful without being burning hot. My friend enjoyed the pig cheek pot pie. I just wanted to reach over and eat the crust. We had to try the biscuit donut. What a genius idea. Absolutely loved it. The only bad thing is that I had trouble getting my jeans to button after the meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Rad cocktails, awesome menu selection, my favorite burger in town.  If you are looking for some awesome drinks and tasty food check it out. I recommend the soul burger and the fried chicken skins.  The corn bread is delicious!"}
{"text":"I will say, I expected A LOT from Okra, since my friends said such amazing things about their multitude of visits. It could have been that my expectations were too high. However, my experience was full of highs and lows. Unfortunately, mostly lows. We dined on Friday May 20 at about 7:30, on the patio (which was quite lovely).  I started with the bright eye, bushy tail, on the recommendation of our server. So, I HATE dairy and in her description she never mentioned that there was dairy in it. Sure, I should have read the description so that was on me. I then ordered a sinister kid, which was delightful.  We had the fried chicken skins and the hush puppies, which were both really tasty. I was quite happy with those. For my main, I ordered the Tennessee hot chicken, which was pretty awful, especially considering how wonderful the fried chicken skins are. First of all, I asked for a biscuit instead of cornbread, great. Well, the chicken arrived with pickles. Normally, if something seems as though it would come with pickles, I'd ask for them to hold the pickles, as they seep into whatever you're eating. But in what world would fried chicken come with pickles? The menu doesn't state this. So, the server (who was awesome) offered to get me a new plate, that was great. Unfortunately, when my plate was returned to me, my biscuit was covered in gravy. COVERED. Back to the dairy thing, I hate gravy. Had the menu said there was gravy, I would have asked for the biscuit without gravy. The gravy also got all over my chicken, and I wasn't about to complain about something else, so I just used my napkin to wipe as much off as I could. The chicken itself was cold and soggy. I have had Tennessee hot chicken plenty of times, and never has it been cold. It was also not spicy at all, which is kindof the whole point of ordering it. I tried my friends' dishes, the meatballs and the beef brasato, which were both far better than my cold chicken. For dessert, we each had a donut, which was good, though very sweet. If you don't like sweet, you won't like this. It was almost too sweet for me, but it was pretty good.  Overall, the starters were excellent, and the drink without dairy was delightful. I wish their menu was more informative and I wish my dish was served hot and not soggy. I would love to go back and give it another try, but based on my experience it would take a lot to get me back there."}
{"text":"Great variations on Southern  comfort  food.   Wings appetizers great and unique.  Pig cheek pot pie savory and delicious.   Great light crust and mashed potato base."}
{"text":"Okra did not disappoint. Had a late lunch/early dinner, so we had the restaurant mostly to our selves. The staff was friendly and the space was nice. For starters we had the delicious chicken skins that had a nice kick with sweetness, cornbread that tasted like waffles (so good), and hush puppies. Then I decided to try a Mint Julep! It had a big sprig of mint and was beautiful covered with snow--well powered sugar that looked like snow. The drink looked like a snow cone made with round pellets of ice. Don't let the smooth taste fool ya! This drink packs a punch. Helped me sleep all night. We went on to order Buttermilk Meatball with Grits (creamiest grits I every eat), Catfish Gremolata with Okra Succotash, and Sal Focaccia, all very delicious. Can't wait to visit Okra again. One tip-waitstaff needs to leave their cell phones in the back until breaks. Bartender had to whistle to the waitress to come get my drink and bring it to me."}
{"text":"I had heard amazing things about Okra prior to dining here, but unfortunately the New Year's Eve experience we had was completely disappointing! I made a reservation on OpenTable a few days before NYE; the restaurant called me the day before to confirm which was nice. When we arrived, we were seated at the table right next to the entrance. The restaurant isn't too big with only a few standard tables, some high tops, & bar seating. I wasn't a fan of our proximity to the door so I asked if we could be moved to a high top. They were happy to accommodate the table change which we appreciated.  Our server came by and got our drink orders of the Hurricane & the Blueberry Buck. We also started off with an order of the Mac & Cheese balls with marinara sauce. Both drinks were really tasty, strong and full of flavor as noted in the descriptions. The Mac & Cheese balls were nothing special, but a decent-sized appetizer to ramp up our appetite for dinner.  I can't think of the last time my fiancé & I ordered the same thing at a restaurant, but we were both so enticed by the Tennessee Hot fried chicken that we both got that for our main course. I added a side of cornbread & my fiancé added a side of black eyed peas & a biscuit. The black eyed peas & biscuit were both okay options for sides, I personally liked the black eyed peas more. To my surprise, the fried chicken was already served with cornbread so I had two pieces of dry cornbread. They were slightly burnt around the edges & just tasted off. I love cornbread, so that was highly disappointing. Moreover though, what I wasn't expecting was the amount of hot sauce! The fried chicken was almost at room temperature & then drenched in hot sauce which caused it to be super soggy .. completely unappetizing that I only had a couple of bites & was done.   Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but because of the rave review I really expecting a lot more. Okra unfortunately did not meet those expectations."}
{"text":"Hooowww have I not written a review about this place yet?! I'm dying to stand up on my soapbox!   The fiance´ and I have come to Okra twice now, and both times we've sat at the bar (everyone knows the bar is the best place in any restaurant). Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).  Some highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented. Their juleps are to die for!  Next, the apps: you shouldn't come here if you're not planning on getting appetizers. Just turn around and go home. The Fried Chicken Skins are unreal. Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.  On to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.  Lastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...  The pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).  The donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*  One pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find. The sign is on 7th so you might be tempted to pull into the parking lot where it is, but you have to turn down Palo Verde (small side street) to get to it - it'll be on your left."}
{"text":"I love Okra. I think Chef Cullen makes amazing food, yet this place is laid back and relaxed in atmosphere. The employees are all very friendly and welcoming. Definitely go for the Soul Burger, the Calabrian Pork Bites w/ greens and the Pork Cheek Pot Pie - to die for!. The cocktails are all pretty delicious and refreshing. They even have a cocktail that is served in an old glass milk container... it's so adorable.  Come hungry and come with friends so you can try a little bit of everything. Definitely a great addition to this up and coming neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Met up with a bestie for an early dinner today and got a nice surprise.  To be honest, I wasn't too hungry but my friend and I had a lot of catching up to do and Okra was her pick, so off I went.  First off, the weather was absolutely perfect and we took a lovely table outside.  We were able to take advantage of HH pricing and ordered beverages, a Cobbler for me and a Teetotaller for her.  They were both delicious!  We ordered an assortment of appetizers: the Dilly Beans- fried green beans with a dipping sauce- were fantastic! The wings were yummy, very tender and flavorful.  The mac-and-cheese balls with marinara were good but needed more kick, in my opinion.  We also had the hush puppies with goat cheese, which was an interesting and unlikely combination that worked well.  We also had the canned biscuit donut with the salted caramel for dessert---pretty darned delish!  All in all, it was a yummy meal and we were both pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Had cocktails and apps here a few nights ago. Loved the menu everything we had was well prepared and delicious.  The cocktails were unique and the bartenders were great.  Will definitely be a regular here and bring all my friends to check it out.  Well done to the Chef!"}
{"text":"Okra is a very interesting place, I found Okra from Yelp but I don't think the food categories of Southern food and Italian food were true to what I saw. On the menu I felt that it was new twists to Southern home cooking but nothing close to Italian cuisine.  Okra has a wonderful ambience, quiet and relaxing, and it has a   beautiful patio and full bar. I enjoyed Okra but nothing I had was super enough to go back."}
{"text":"Slammin! Get the canned biscuit donut with true buttermilk ice cream...ridiculous!  Great service!  Check out the size of the chickens!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed stopping by Okra for first time last night. Wick drink and bite, tried the greens and chicken skin, both were very good. Excellent drink list as well. Will come back for full meal sometime soon."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I loved the atmosphere. Our waitress was amazing and suggested great choices for us. The fried chicken skins and pork belly is so, so good. Must try. As well as the hush puppies. All the drinks were fresh and delicious. Highly recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"Good down home Southern good.   Fried Chicken skin - delicious!   I had the chicken fried steak - it was delicious (just not hot- warm) but delicious!   Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly yummy!  My husband and I love trying new restaurants for date night and I found this place on Yelp so we went last week and I am still talking about it to all my friends.  First off the vibe is cool with a southern, industrial look and the restaurant itself is pretty small so it's a more intimate feeling.  It's nice having a smaller restaurant space when on a date night because even though the place was packed and bustling, we could still talk to each other without feeling like we were shouting.  One big bonus is they have a huge parking lot out back so parking was a breeze compared to some other restaurants in the area.  Once inside our waiter was fantastic.  He was knowledgeable and available without being overbearing.  We took him up on his food and drink recommendations and I'm so glad we did because they were so good that I'm still talking about it a week later.  We started with the mac n cheese balls then I had the short ribs and my hubby had the ham.  The flavors were perfect and the portions were huge!  I normally don't order dessert and I was so full but I couldn't pass up the caramel donut with sea salt. Great atmosphere, amazing staff and food and cocktails- definitely go check out this place!"}
{"text":"Did a search on Google for the best cocktails in Phoenix and ended up here. Was not disappointed. The food and cocktails were excellent. Followed Yelpers suggestions for the crispy chicken skins with the chile honey sauce and had my first taste of ho cakes with prosciutto. The wife had the beef brasato with broccolini and enjoyed it immensely. Another place to frequent on Fridays:-)"}
{"text":"Loved this spot!  Expertly crafted cocktails, fun and unique.  Wonderful happy hour food specials including offal and veggies and wings with a white BBQ sauce!  Lots of attention to detail.  Waitstaff was phenomenal- authentic and friendly.  She even asked our names at the end of our meal and told us about the space and what other businesses were coming to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"had dinner with three other people, theplace is small and intimate.  The wine and beer list is way to small but true.  It is basically a mixologist type place.  My Tequila Ocho margarita was excellent, two others had Champagne Juleps which were amazing.  We shared very nice appetizers.  The main courses were very nice.  The restaurant was quite noisy because of a group behind us (20+) with very young children.   Bottom line this Crudo restaurant is good  but not 5*.  Its not a place for everybody.  I liked it."}
{"text":"Don't mistake my (3 stars) as mediocre. Okra is above-average in quality. My wife and I may, or may not be back, but it's not because our experience wasn't good. We just enjoy trying different places -- constantly. But Okra was a GREAT first experience. Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. The food portions were a little small, but good in quality. The drinks were mixed strong (which is always a good thing) :-) And the ambiance was nice. Definitely worth trying out if you're ever wanting to head to Downtown Phoenix. I HIGHLY recommend the donut desert thing. 5 STARS for that thing easy! :-)"}
{"text":"I was there for the soft opening Friday night and it was packed.  Before I start let me say that I love Crudo and I want to love Chef Cullen's newest venture just as much.  Southern food generally speaking is simple food for simple palates, this is not a criticism, just an observation.  Southern food is comfort food and usually comes in heaping servings, it comes with grits, collared greens, big biscuits, mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, red beans and rice and fried potatoes of some sort.  It comes out big, glistening and hot.  This is not exactly what you will get at Okra.  I started with the fried chicken skins for my first appetizer and it was as delicious it sounds.  It was not a big serving but it was enough.  The honey drizzled on top was a nice touch.  My other appetizer was the okra, the namesake for Crudo #2 and I expected something special.  It was perhaps the most tender non woody okra I have ever chewed on and I appreciate that, but it was also lacking in flavor.  Maybe it was boiled too long, or left on the grill too long or the combination of boiling and grilling, I don't know.  I ordered the fried chicken and it was very good, fried to the point where it was more brown than golden. I do not know if the chicken was organic but I expect it was because the breast and leg were not huge and plump like the kind you might pull out of a red and white bucket.  I keep going back to size and portions not because I am a gourmand, but because of the incongruity with the theme.  I would have enjoyed a side of grits, collared greens and a biscuit to go with those two smaller than expected pieces of chicken.  Lastly I ordered the Johnnycakes because I was craving something starchy.  The johnnycakes were a bit of a disappointment, essentially small pancakes without butter or syrup or powdered sugar or fruit or jam,  but instead it came with something I recognized from my years in Richmond, pimento cheese.  I used to eat this on crackers mostly at parties, but it just seemed odd sitting there cool and stiff next to the johnnycakes which were not nearly hot enough to make the cheese melt.      Lastly, I have to give very high marks to the bar.  The drinks were exceptional and this was no surprise.  I noticed that one of the cocktails the \"Folk and Americana\" incorporated Old Overholt rye whiskey and I have to give props to whoever made the decision to use this much maligned (and unfairly so) working man's rye to make such a wonderful cocktail.  The Greenpoint too hit the mark, a higher octane version of the Manhattan (rye in place of whisky and Chartreuse substituted for Vermouth) yet smooth and aromatic as could be.  I would like to see a dimmer room and some traditional comfort sides and this would be a real winner."}
{"text":"Husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last night and as Crudo fans, we were hoping for awesome.    Unfortunately, it fell significantly short of awesome.    It was HOT in there and I really wanted to order a drink and pull up a chair for our server (who was sweet, kind, attentive and practically melting on her feet).  She said the AC hadn't been functioning well for weeks but management wasn't seeing it and customers weren't complaining.  (I saw at least five patrons including myself fanning themselves with menus.)      It was also extremely loud.  The acoustics are such that everything echos and it turned into Husband and I speaking loudly to each other.    Me: \"Happy Anniversary!\" Him: \"We can't afford a new car.\"    The drinks were outstanding.  The food was...  meh.  I loved the hush puppies and goat cheese combo but Husband made the point that you shouldn't rely on condiments to make the meal.  He's right.  The little buggers were pretty dry.    I ordered the buttermilk meatballs and was underwhelmed.  I hate to say this but they were reminiscent of Sloppy Joes.  Husband had the pulled pork and as a BBQ fan, he was wasn't thrilled with it.    We decided to cut our losses and skip dessert."}
{"text":"Really good. Creative menu with a nice variety of flavor.  I'm going to fore warn I'm going to make a few comments but it was still good and I would go back again.  Tried the fried chicken skins and bone marrow/biscuit/short rib - pepper jelly for the appetizer.  Biscuit was extremely dense AKA rock hard, to me it robbed the marrow snd jelly of the glory of being a fantastic dish. I know it is unconventional but I wouldn't have minded the marrow and short rib - pepper jelly on a KFC biscuit instead.  My mouth was focused on the brick underneath the savory goodness. As for the chicken skins...less is more sometimes. The batter on the skins was so thick it was ballooned around the skin....a lightly dusting on the skins would have highlighted a good old fashioned treat kicked up a notch with a spicy honey.  The pot pie with mash was good. It was exactly what it said it was...no frills. No peas. Herbs, spices, cheese and garlic are to cliche for the hipster vibe with mash potato but we all know how good it is...too bad they were absent.  Southern hot fried chicken was done well with good flavor, heat and seasoning. It came with a brick of cornbread.  Literally brick.   The decor was cool and trendy. Nice open kitchen. Attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised that they had happy hour!   We tried the fried chicken skin with honey hot sauce -- it's so good! But it did start to get a little spicy in the end.   The bone marrow came with a biscuit and oxtail and pepper jam that is so tasty -- I could order the jam by itself. But I wasn't sure about the biscuit, it was a little dense. But that didn't stop us from placing another order!   I tried the okra cup and was so refreshing.   Can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  It was about 40 minutes before the server took our entrée order.  He walked away as I was talking to him. He took multiple trips to complete our order. Basically we got service like it was rush hour and they were understaffed, but it was only about 20% full. At the end of the meal I asked the server to split the check and was telling him which appetizers to put on my card. He pulled the ticket out of my hand as I was talking and walked away.  Maybe he's hard of hearing, it wasn't a nice experience.   I didn't think the food was worth the cost in calories or dollars. Everything was extremely heavy and salty. We got the bone marrow appetizer.  It was disgusting. It smelled terrible. Basically dog food. The chicken skins were ok, but dripping with grease. The burger was ok, but dripping with grease. The ham and pancake appetizer was ok. The mussels were ok. The head cheese was good. Almost everything was way too salty. Even the doughnut was just ok. Nothing we had was great.   My colleagues, who normally have 2 or 3 drinks with dinner only had one.  So I'm guessing they weren't all that great either.   The patio chairs are a bit small, so quite uncomfortable for those of use who are overweight."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Crudo, so had high hopes for Okra.  Raised in the Deep South on similar dishes, I was a little disappointed, although not so much that I won't give them another chance...and try something different next time.  Pros: Service was excellent.  Cooper was friendly and helpful. The patio was quaint.  The canned biscuit donut was cooked perfectly! The cocktail was delicious! Food temp and presentation were nice.  Cons: The cocktail was delivered after the food. The smothered fried chicken was good, but not great.  The fried okra was under seasoned.   I'd love to re-visit this place and try another dish or two."}
{"text":"We had a going away party at OKRA yest.  The staff at OKRA was remarkable. The manager Maureen did a phenomenal job in accommodation all our needs. She interacted with us and always made sure we were all having a good time. OKRA was definitely the perfect place for any special occasion. We had an amazing time and will return. Thank you guys so much!"}
{"text":"The best cocktails in town - period.  Solid food.  Great service.  Reasonable prices, you gotta pay for quality stuff."}
{"text":"Happy Hour both times and this place is great. Awesome cocktails, great deals on their snacks. One of my favorites. More details to come."}
{"text":"The stretch of 7th Street between Missouri and Bethany Home has become quite a dining and happy hour destination and I'm glad it is so, as this is pretty much in my neighborhood. And for happy hour in this area, my choice is Okra. I love the casual atmosphere and the very warm and friendly service. The HH bites are an upscale take on some Southern favorites and the drinks are  well crafted - all of these at good prices. Patio seating is available and because of the position of the patio, it is shaded by the main building in the afternoon, thus making it a good area for happy hour decompressing even on warm or hot days. First timers to the area take note: it's easy to miss as you drive through 7th Street since the signage does not make it immediately noticeable. Just look for The Crown just south of Bethany Home Rd; parking and entry is at the back of the complex."}
{"text":"Sooo ... I completely had this place confused with Ocotillo.   Because I am a moron.   Okay, not a moron. Just not so great at paying attention to detail.   Anyway, this place was delicious. I mean, moan as you're eating delicious. I have been dreaming about those fried chicken skins ever since. And those hoe cakes? Jesus. Nothing like a hoe cake and some chicken skin, am I right?  This place was so good, I had to go on three hikes in the heat just to work off the damage. Have you ever hiked at noon in Phoenix in June? Yeah, don't. Reason #2 I am a moron.   But a lovable moron. The kind of moron you want to eat hoe cakes with."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Deep south southern cuisine with yummy dishes like pork rinds, mozzarella cheese balls, deep fried chicken skins and the ever so popular smoked chicken wings, not to mention the hush puppies. This definitely isn't the place to go if you don't like pork. The food on the menu had a different twist to some of the Southern dishes we were used to hearing about. The cocktails were handcrafted which is always my favorite. My personal favorite was the \"So Fresh So clean\" cocktail. A fresh vodka with grapefruit drink that was refreshing yet had a nice kick to it. This fails in comparison to Shara's Old Fashion. You had to be grown to take that one down. LOL   Until next time....Sharon"}
{"text":"After stumbling across this place on yelp and reading some reviews, the Wife and I decided to give this place a try. Patty was our server and she was AWESOME!! I started with the Pina Tail on the Donkey and the Wife had the Pineapple Propeller. We both enjoyed our drinks, so much so that I had 2 more. We shared the cheese balls......they were good. For dinner the Wife had the fried chicken, umbrian style. We both agreed that it was very tasty, but almost too much salt on the skin. I had the meatballs, no complaints what so ever. To finish the meal we shared the doughnut. We could of had 12 more of those.   Over all our experience was amazing. Great food and service. We will go back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  An adventure in dining.  Fun.  All of these things made our dinner a great experience.  Our waiter, Kyle, helped on all counts, including adding a smattering of humor to our table.  Kind of a down home adventurous version of Crudo.  Just sitting with my two adult children and listening to them banter over the selections was part of the fun.  Should we start with \"Snacks\" (small versions of yummy treats) or go directly to \"Share\" (a slightly larger selection) and will we still want to order \"Big\"?  Yes to all three.  The fried chicken wings with the hot honey sauce was everything Kyle said it would be.  I wanted to lick the bowl of the Potlikker Mussels, and how can you not have fun at a place that serves deep fried dilly beans!  If I had to say something bad about the experience, which isn't even their fault, but I looked forward to an ice cold Dixie beer.  Apparently, the distributor stopped delivering to them.  Shame on them.  But again, not Okra's fault and Kyle was quick to find another beer that was ALMOST as good.  Can't wait to go back.  I want to try the game hens.  Or maybe the pig cheek pot pie."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service, the two bar boys that served us tonight (Thursday) I wish I had asked for their names but they were the best, the drinks were phenomenal. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Fun dinner  our table had the shrimp over grits; Bar-B-Que meatloaf and their chicken plate. Think southern cooking - they hit that sweet spot.  I would have enjoyed the shrimp more were they blackened. Irate this a great place for southern fried chicken. The patio is lovely this time of year"}
{"text":"Oh man... I am so sad about this one. Came here on a Saturday night around 7:00pm. It wasn't too busy. I'd say about 8-10 tables. So at the time I didn't think much for the 2 bartenders and the 1 server. But the tables just kept coming and the severs and bartenders stayed the same. We got a lot of little stuff to share; a side if Fried Okra $6, Bone Marrow with Oxtail, Red Pepper Jam & Biscuit $13, Shaved Catfish, fries, crystal aioli, pickle vinaigrette $15, and Buffalo Octopus, pickled celery, bleu cheese $15..... FIRST.... If you are going to charge that much for these dishes can we have enough to feed more than a small child?! These are all \"starters\" that usually means a shareable appetizer. I think I was especially disappointed in the Bone Marrow. There was NO Marrow. We literally just got a bone... I wish we would have just gotten the side of jam and biscuits that came with the bone. The Shaved Catfish and fries were pretty good, crunch pieces of panko fried fish and crispy french-fries.  The Buffalo Octopus was tasty, good amount of buffalo and not too chewy. My favorite dish here though was the size of Okra we got. These were so poppable, very addicting, the sauce had a tiny bit of a kick that complimented the Okra very well and this side was the only thing we got that had a good amount of food.   Unfortunately I think we came here on a night where they just weren't prepared. They ended up calling a guy in to help them toward the end of our meal. We know this because they were panicking and talking behind the bar. I would like to come back for Happy Hour and see how things stack up there. But as for right now, I am left with a bit of a \"salty\" taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food. Sunday brunch specials are fantastic and always different. Had a cornbread french toast and a pork cheek potato hash that was very rich and savory. The onion jam with noble bread was also very tasty. The balsamic cut through the sweetness. It's also nice to get proteins like their fried chicken that are free of hormones and other junk. It makes the chicken smaller, but it tastes a lot better."}
{"text":"I wished I loved the food at Okra, because this place is cool, drinks are good and the service is amazing. However, I came here twice and unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of their food. We started out with the fried chicken skins. I can't recall in my lifetime where I have had fried chicken skins and didn't like it...Until I had the fried chicken skins at Okra. It's not bad by any means. It just tasted really bland. I guess I was expecting extremely crispy, salty chicken skins and I ended up being disappointed. The grilled oysters were pretty good. I usually like my oysters raw but those were delicious. The mussels were good too, but the cornbread it came with was ordinary. I had their shrimp and grits and thought it was okay. My boyfriend had the chicken and dumplings and thought it wasn't anything special.  **Don't let my review fool you though. Try this place out. My whole family LOVED this place so you might as well too! I still want to give this place a third try."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. The ambiance is perfect, the food impeccable and the service from MarySue was amazing. She was knowledgable and gave the best suggestions without seeming pushy.  We will be back.."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience!!!  This place is by far one of my favorite, if not my favorite restaurant in the valley!  What makes this place 5 stars? 1 . food- 3 very thing we ate was amazing. The fried chicken skin, wings, oso bucco, Cornish hen, etc were just mouth watering.  2. Drinks- were great. I highly recommend the pineapple propeller   3. Service- our waitress was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, and very sweet  4. Enviorment     For: 2 appatizers, 4 cocktails, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts we spent ($123 before tip) and it was worth EVERY DIME"}
{"text":"If you don't come here once if you live in Phoenix or in the area, I'm sorry for you...Ty, our server from Long Beach was awesome, and made the evening and food exceptional!!! Thanks Ty, you made our mouths water with the descriptions, and the food exceed our expectations! I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Can't wait until my next visit.  The food was delicious and the drinks were perfect.  My girlfriends and I shared several different food items.  The chicken skins and biscuit with apple butter were by far my favorites!"}
{"text":"Meh. Food ok, wish there was more of it. Their \"shared\" portions can only be shared with an imaginary friend or someone currently on anorexia diet (pardon me, I thought Southerners like to eat, anyhow I do).  Drinks were good, I believe $8-14 range. Our waitress was a tad snooty, someone ordered a Bud Light (I know blasphemy) and she kinda scoffed at that (apparently they don't serve it, but she brought a Coors Light, because that's so different, c'mon). Cool patio, nicely decorated.  Not my shot of vodka, but it may be yours."}
{"text":"I've lied (\"Ooh yeah, we can't eat there, that place has rats\")   I've Blackmailed (\"do you really want your wife to find out what we do on guys night out?\")  I've Scammed: (\"Grandma, you missed my Birthday again. Yes you can treat me to dinner; I know just the place.\")   I'll pull a Cop & Blow, I'll play the Shill if need. But in truth, I'm a Grifter. All to get back to you, Okra.   I need no excuses. I make no apologies.   I am a bad man, and you made me this way.    I introduce friends to this restaurant, just so they'll celebrate birthdays here: \"Friends, this is Okra. Okra, this is friends.\"  And every time, friends love it (\"how did I not know about this?) and every time, they rave (\"how have I never been here?\").  What's that, you ask? My percentage?   Why don't you fire me up some of that world class Headcheese, and maybe we'll talk."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best chicken wings I have possibly ever had. Their cocktails are phenomenal and the bartenders are so warm and welcoming. If you only go for appetizers and cocktails you'd be very happy with choosing this gem, but their entire menu is fantastic.   If you are looking for good southern food I would choose Okra over Southern Rail any day of the week.   Oh yeah, also-- do yourself a favor try the wings and the grilled broccolini it's fantastic also."}
{"text":"It's a work in progress so it's kind of tricky to find it.  On the bright side, it's got a nice big parking lot so it isn't a hassle to go.  The Pineapple Propeller is the best cocktail I've probably ever had.  I usually don't drink cocktails but I would definitely go back for this one.  The Okra Cup was ok and is on the happy hour list but nothing to write home about.  We tried the divoli (?) flatbread which is basically a pepperoni pizza (very red peppery pepperoni).  The wings were seasoned well and grilled, though a bit too much.  They were tiny and a good portion of them were completely black on one side.  The fried cheese balls are actually fried mac and cheese balls.  The fried chicken skin was just that, with a sweet sauce on top.  Overall, the food was nothing too special.  I wouldn't come for happy hour food, maybe I'll try an entree next time to go with the Pineapple Propeller."}
{"text":"Interesting menu...drink menu is amazing....had oysters, mussels for a \" snack\" they were pretty good...had the fish and hush puppies, fish was a little under cooked for me but was good other wise. Had the ham hock with black eyed pea was very delicious...had 2 mixed drinks , th3 Pina the tail on the donkey it was holy rum!! Also had the Hurricane which was sorta spicy.... It's pretty loud in there, mixed groups,  hipsters, middle aged, even some elderly people it's definitely a place to visit..."}
{"text":"Delicious food but even more amazing cocktails. My wife and I are thrilled that the bartender is actually excited when she orders a classic cocktail that takes about 10 minutes to make. Whenever we can get away, this is our go-to spot."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to going here for a long time and tonight was the night. When I called over to see if there was a wait at 6 PM I was told that it was really empty. When we showed up at 7:30, there was only one other table of two there. How could such a supposedly cool and popular restaurant be completely empty on a Wednesday? After we ate there, we knew why.... supposedly they are famous for their fried chicken but the fried chicken was definitely not made fresh. It seemed like it was a reheated from earlier or even another day. The corn bread it was served with was dry and relatively tasteless. My friend and I each ordered the fondue Berger. He didn't like his but was polite and ate some of it. I sent mine back because I thought it was inedible.  The fries appeared to have been from a frozen bag.  I then ordered a salad instead and it came out so swimming in dressing and of us at the table could even believe it. Sent that back to. Have never in my life ordered something, I had it replaced, and sent that back as well!  And did I mention that even though there was no one in the restaurant, it took at least 45 minutes for us to be served? On a lighter note, the brewing Company across the way it was packed and everyone in there seem to be having a great time! Definitely will try that next time."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for a birthday dinner and I will say we all left full and happy. Service was really quick and the hostess was very nice and accommodating for our early 5 top.  To start I got the pineapple propeller, which was so tasty, and really well balanced. Our table got an order of the smoked wings with white BBQ, tomato and watermelon salad, Calabrese pork (on greens), mussels with cornbread, fried chicken skins, and then for the main we all split the catfish.  I loved the mussels, the broth they were in I almost wanted to bathe in. The wings were really good, they were smoked and glazed really well. The fried chicken skin was delicious, especially with the house made hot sauce. My date loved the pork belly bites with the Calabrese chili sauce, he said the greens were the best he's ever had. The watermelon salad was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again cause it seems kind of common among valley eateries (the other salads I will definitely be ordering). I have to say the catfish was delicious. It was perfectly cooked and the succotash (sp?) was really good.  I understand the mix of flavors here, taking from the south and mixing with some Italian favorites. I have to say their happy hour eats and drinks are definitely worth a trip here.  Also, if it's your birthday you get a delicious donut with salted caramel sauce.  The only thing I didn't try (and kind of didn't understand but might next time was the focaccia, they sounded good, but I guess it was hard to go from fried chicken to pizza)"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried chicken and okra. The chicken was burned. When I asked the waiter about it he said they been having problems making sure it was cooked all the way. So the result was some of the smaller pieces may look dark. Which to me is a way of saying yes, I served you burned chicken, \"what are you going to do about it?\" The okra was not a pleasing experience. I love okra, and had been looking forward to this experience for months. Talk about being disappointed! The cornmeal batter was devoid of taste. It just left a gritty texture but without a pleasing taste. Again, I think the okra was a victim of over cooking in oil as well. I will not be returning. Dinner for two with no apps or drinks was almost $60. Way overpriced.I do not suspect they will be in business for long. Central Phoenix kitchen, right across the breezeway, didn't have any open tables. Whereas okra, the supposed higher-end, higher-quality restaurant, only had three tables with guests."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Okra as we loved Crudo!  We stopped in for happy hour and ordered the hush puppies (super dry - yuck!) and the cava ($3 off - sweet).  The bartenders were really friendly, but this place is nothing like the caliber of Crudo.  Hopefully they will work out the kinks in their menu and we'll consider giving it another try."}
{"text":"Food was amazing ... threat service and great food. Nice and clean restaurant. They have really good drinks and food I would recommend very chill environment!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come here. First off the bartenders are AMAZING. So helpful and thoughtful in their suggestions. In our party we had the chance to try 6 different cocktails and each one was on point. We will definitely be back for the cocktails. The food was very nice, but I just get tired of fried food at a point and they didn't really have a good counterbalance for it in my opinion on the menu. I will definitely be back for the drinks though and the hoe cakes with the spread."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! But my $20.00 chicken fried steak was a huge Debbie Downer! Not worth it ;("}
{"text":"We decided to visit okra for dinner. The drinks menu is extensive and interesting. The appetizers were good. We tried the chicken fried skins and Mac and cheese balls. Skins got good  reaction for creativity of flavor and textures by my friends. The Mac and cheese friend balls were decent. There is a lack of availability of vegetarian menu options. But it is a good addition to Phoenix scene."}
{"text":"This was an amazing evening. I had my birthday dinner here last night. The food was out standing, cocktails were so good, the service was great, and atmosphere was awesome. They were very accommodating for our large party. They help make my birthday amazing!"}
{"text":"Have already been twice since their soft opening last weekend! Love this new neighborhood place from the team behind crudo. Have had the Tennessee hot fried chicken, the stack salad, chicken wings and a focaccia flatbread....all of it delicious! The drinks are great and the atmosphere is perfect for a low key dinner at the bar! Okra will definitely be in my restaurant rotation from now on!"}
{"text":"The 2 most important things in a restaurant is food and ambiance - and Okra hit it out of the park! I went with my friend and we pigged out! We got the mussels to start (phenomenal) and the bone marrow which is not something I would order on my own but oh my gosh, be adventurous and eat this! The jam, oxtail, bone marrow and biscuit all in one bite - to die for!   Then I got the Umbrian fried chicken - the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. Great seasoning and SO crispy. Yum! My friend ordered the pork - it was huge! The size of her head! The meat was delicious, very tender and juicy, great flavor. The only downside of this is we ordered the mashed potatoes as a side and they came out lukewarm and bland. The texture was like instant mashed potatoes, too. Very thin and watery. But that's not enough to make this review less than 5 stars cause everything else was exceptional - even my Pimm's cup drink was super yummy! Great date place - be it with a significant other or a friend. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We finally found this place ... it is in the backside of the Crown Plaza.  Don't park on the 7th St, as you have to walk around the building.  I rarely call out servers by name, but James was excellent.  Impeccable service, excellent knowledge of the menu and spot on recommendations after chatting for a few minutes.  Drinks -- Pimm's Cup, Sazerac, and the orange creamsicle thing - all fantastic.  Fortunately, we were walking home, so over-indulging wasn't a concern.  We came early to try a bunch of things from the HH menu menu.  Chicken skins, hush puppies, corn bread, hoe cakes, cheese balls, etc...  Definitely not health food, but my soul felt much better at the end of the night.  Regarding spice, they have concocted an interesting balance between sweet and spicy.  Plus, their hot sauce on the tables has a wide mouth, so be careful that you don't get more than expected.  We will definitely be back to continue exploring their menus."}
{"text":"Ahh....so much riding on this! So the husband and I (with our 8 month-old in tow) met friends here tonight for dinner. First of all, was a little nervous about bringing the little one, however we went early (4:45pm) and the hostess did not seem to be ruffled a bit at our presence. I had read that it may not be great for kids (was happily surprised!)--though I could see that later this place might be for date nights and parties sans kids, so the earlier the better IMO. I don't have a refined pallet therefore don't want to go into each dish except to say they were freaking delicious! The chicken skins were amazing (covered in Honey....I know, so good), and the dessert donut was UNREAL. So,so good!! The highlight for me was the Old Fashioned (5$ on H.H) and the meatballs with grits. I do eat low carb and will admit I had to make a game-time decision to have a mid-week cheat meal, but other than that--no complaints. So happy with our time here, and maybe next time we will get a babysitter and an Uber and really take advantage of the cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"It was simply fantastic  Having been big fans of Crudo, we had our hopes up for Okra and it did not disappoint.  Chef Campbell is a genius  The highlights of our night were: Fried Chicken Skins (one of the best things i've ever had - could eat them all day) Calabrian Pork Bites & Greens Potlikker Mussels (Mmmm... the cornbread) Smoked Chicken Wings (Amazing) Quattro Focaccia  The bigs were excellent as well but we like to dabble with the small stuff  A great addition to the phoenix food restaurant scene"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and drinks. Food was ok, but nothing really that special.  Service was fantastic and very friendly.  All in all a good place to hangout and get drinks.  Just don't expect too much with the food."}
{"text":"Great addition to the PHX food scene! We started off with the grilled broccolini (very underrated in my opinion) and the pork bites. I preferred the broccolini but the pork was good, just a bit more watery than I was expecting. Shared the two wash hen as a main course, spectacular! Very well done and the chicken was succulent. Finished with the canned biscuit donut which was decadent to say the least. Overall, great atmosphere and decor with a killer patio! Will have to come back for happy hour next time :)"}
{"text":"The fried chicken (supposedly the signature dish) was only slightly better than Popeye's or KFC, but the price was 7x more. The side dishes were terrible. The ambiance was cool and if the food was better I would go back, but the combination of cost ($15- $20 per entree) and quality of food (Applebee's is a fair equivalent) means I'm not going back. At this price point I expect something better than fast food on a fancy plate."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Crudo is one of my favourite restaurants in the city, so I had high hopes making a reservation here. Big mistake.  Throughout the meal, we kept thinking, \"We could make this better at home.\" Everything tasted like it's fried in the same batter. The hoecakes were alright; I was hoping to taste more cornmeal but they were like regular pancakes. The country ham was chewy and kind of... wet? Hard to explain but trust me, it was gross. Fried dilly beans were too battered-coated to really taste the beans. Tasted more like an artificial dill pickle chip flavour. The fried chicken was the biggest let-down of all. Like come on, how can a Southern restaurant not do fried chicken properly? We ordered TN Hot, which even our waitress agreed was more of a medium/mild-wing sauce level of hot. That's not true Tennessee hot chicken. The meat was dry as well. Our side was hush puppies, which just tasted like the batter used in everything else.  Definitely won't return or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Aaaahhh!!!! Another fantastic restaurant by Chef Cullen Campbell and his dynamic wife, Maureen!!! Housed in the fabulous renovated Crown on 7thst, this place is charming, warm and inviting! Reclaimed wood flooring is magnificent. The decor is so minimalist just like Crudo. Well done, Maureen! The staff as always is unpretentious yet so passionate about the food. Why shouldn't they be!!! The oysters al forno are wood roasted that are truly the best in the valley, Bone marrow is well just life changing!!!! Everything from the cocktails to the wine to the food and desert were divine . The only item I feel that was not to par was the beef entree. It was well seasoned, sauce was incredible, however the beef itself was a wad of fat. Other than that everything was incredible. Affordable as well.... Kudos to the Chef and his team for the creativity. Lots of fun, fabulous food, great ambiance!!!! Busy yet attentive!!!! Can't wait to go back...."}
{"text":"There's an expectation when you go here. It should be at least as good as crudo. It wasn't.  Cocktails and atmosphere were great.  We had the fried chicken, it was super greasy and in tiny portions. We ordered corn bread on the side and thank god we did because the cornbread muffin they gave us was teeny tiny. The cornbread was thin and dry, it's like they tried to make it prestigious but it made it dried up and not great tasting.   We also had a focaccia. It wasn't a focaccia. It was a pizza. It had good flavor, a nice honey glaze on the sausage. The middle of the pizza was soggy!! Gross. I hope they get better but I'm not sure that we will return. I was honestly hoping for more BBQ options on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I love the open kitchen and the staff is top notch!  I've had the bone morrow, beef cheek pie and the beef brasato, which was melt in your mouth.  Love this place, I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"The okra and catfish special were unique, tasty and awesome !  The drinks are also unique ..I will return!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! The fried chicken skins were amazing along with the happy hour prices. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The worse meal out in the five years I've been in Phoenix. For starter I ordered pork bites and greens.  with no meat at all, just chunks of fat.  Entree ordered was a hot chicken served with cornbread.  I received a leg and thigh (no white meat) heavily greasy breading which tasted like Louisiana hot sauce and paprika/  There was a big hunk of dry, cold inedible cornbread with some mystery white stuff drizzled on top....should never have been served.  The side of mashed potatoes though cold had good flavor.  Our server was fine and I felt sorry for him due to the awful food.  Meal and tip was 50.00 .....needless to say, I will never go back. Unless they get new chefs with high food standards, this place wont last.  Yuck"}
{"text":"Took my Mom to Okra for her Birthday after hearing great things about the place. Friday night, 6:45pm -- a bit busy, but nothing crazy. We had reservations for four and were seated immediately, but drinks took forever, as did the food. The food was mediocre at best; meatballs were bland and luke warm, and my Mom said the fried chicken was \"about as good as KFC\". Waited a solid 10-15 minutes for the waitress to pick up our check at the end of the night.  On the plus side, the ambiance and decor is nice, and we all really enjoyed the poutine appetizer and the cocktails. Overall though, definitely wouldn't go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"The newest in town and they do it right.  The front facing street to the complex is still under construction as they finalize the remainder of businesses that will be going in the complex but Okra is open for dinner starting at 4pm.    It's a little taste of Louisiana with some trendy hip charm. Both bartenders were pretty straight up guys. We talked sports as I admired their delicious pineapple propeller.  It's a very well balanced drink with a fun garnish.   I sampled three dishes. 1. Namesake grilled okra. It was fine as far as okra goes. There was no spark here. I enjoyed that it was just a fried cliche plate but I guess I wanted more from the sauce drizzled on top. 2. Pork lardons and collared greens. This dish was awesome. It had a slight spice to it and I shoveled it in my mouth. Seriously delicious. 3. Bone marrow. I'm naturally a straight up carnivore and this dish brings it out of me. Spread the marrow and the jam on the biscuit and life is good.  There are still plenty of items I still need to try so I'm sure I'll be seeing you in here."}
{"text":"It was ok.......nothing really stood out except the corn bread.   We sampled several appetizers, again nothing really outstanding, nothing really horrible.  I had the beef brasato for a main entree.......it was nothing outstanding and I ended up not finishing it, something I rarely do!  The brown derby pie I had for desert was a little on the dry side.   Will I ever go back?  Probably not.........so many better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"In short: drinks 5 food 3 abiance 5. Started off fantastic, everyone liked the cocktails, definitely some of the best we've ever had. Dilly beans are a must, could've eaten the sauce with a spoon. The chicken skins were very greasy but had a good taste and sauce. Best meal was the catfish bbq special, with the Verde focaccia and meatballs coming in a close second. Dumplings were firmer than I expected and was just a fancy chicken noodle soup. Finished off the night with another round of cocktails and the best donut you will ever eat. It's a must!"}
{"text":"Great dinner at Okra! Sat at the bar and had great service from Cooper. The fried chicken was amazing had mash and okra. The cocktails were great too. Going to come back and try the pot pie!"}
{"text":"I'm well familiar with their sister restaurant, Crudo, but I stopped here after work today to see it for myself. I just came in to enjoy a cocktail... And was surprised by the BEST Old Fashioned I have EVER had!!! Smooth as silk, and not sticky-sweet.  I'll be back, Mo :-)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in central Phoenix.  I've dined here a few times since their opening and absolutely love the ambiance.  Everything from the meatball and polenta entree to bartenders and wait staff, such a pleasurable and flavorful experience.  If you have never been you must get the Pineapple Propeller to start with.  Not too sweet, just right and oh so refreshing!  You can't go wrong with any of their cocktails.  They all have the perfect balance and makes you want more.  The fried chicken skins are amazing, especially with the house hot sauce.  The hush puppies are quite good, and the bone marrow is fabulous!  On a recent trip we ordered the Tennessee Hot and Umbrian fried chicken and liked it but didn't love it.  While the flavor was great, there was too much breading and not enough chicken.  On another occasion we had the pig cheek pot pie and the beef brassato.  Stunning dishes, so much flavor and rather filling.  I'll keep coming as long as the drinks keep flowing and there is more meat on my fried chicken."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Just beyond. Not worth the time of a detailed review but here are the highlights... Had a reservation. Host/Manager seated a walk in table at the better of two crappy tables that were open and then tried to seat us. I asked if that was all he had he said yes. I then asked if they had something outside...they did. Hmmmmmm After about 7 mins manic (and I mean MANIC) waiter comes over to say he'll be right with us. Another 5 minutes later takes our drink order. During which he argues with me on if I want that drink. It's a classic, I order it often...ok I'll wait while you ask the bartender. Ok order drink. 35 minutes and 2 small plates later we have drinks. Waiter argues with us on food we order. Food was good, but definitely not worth the hype. Not even close.  2.5 hour dinner. We had 1 cocktail. So so disappointed. Will definitely never go back.  And I always give a place a second chance. But I won't give this place another dollar."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. Good ambiance and the combined flavors on the plate were fantastic. Had a hurricane  cocktail with dinner and Amaretto with deserts!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and since we love Crudo I figured Okra was worth checking out. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint. My in laws are from the south so I thought that this would be a perfect place to eat. I can't even believe how great the food and cocktails were. We got a bunch of small plates to start, my favorite was by far the chicken skins. Between the 4 of us we had about 7 different cocktails and they were all superb.   For dinner, I went simple with the pimento cheese burger, but my husband had the fried chicken which came with some of their delicious cornbread. Everything we ate off the menu was great, so I feel like most people could find something that they liked. However, the best part about the whole meal was the desserts, they have lots of great pie options but the Canned Biscuit Doughnut was to-die-for. I would go back just to eat more of those.   The restaurant is not huge and by the time we finished our meal it was packed, so I highly recommend arriving early to avoid having to wait. Can't wait to visit Okra again."}
{"text":"After finding the place walking around the building looking for the door, the food was not good at all & over priced. Would not go back"}
{"text":"Really love the drinks here. They have the most unusual drinks that you say \"who could possibly come up with this??l\" because the ingredients are so different but I have had several and they are all delicious. I can't even remember what's in them but they are so good!  We did have the fried chicken skins. If you can get past what your eating, they are delicious.  Fun atmosphere, small and quaint. We will be back for dinner to try the other items that are as unusual as the drink menu."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktail program and the bartenders are top notch! You can't beat the happy hour prices which are very reasonable considering the quality of the drinks. Mike and the rest of the crew will steer you in the right direction. 5 stars all day!!"}
{"text":"Honesty had a great evening with some delicious food and drinks during the night. Highly, highly, highly recommend the shrimp and grits, apple bread pudding, and chicken skins! For my bourbon drinkers...Old Weller 107 or Weller 12 year. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Okra, for introducing me to the Vieux Carre! I am in love with this drink. I actually made a small batch version and gave it as a gift to a fellow whiskey lover this past holiday season. No worries: I told the recipient to go to Okra: the inspiration. You keep me coming back for more: I dream of working my way through the cocktail menu... I want to try them all!  I seriously love the cocktail menu here because it introduces me to such a great variety of drinks: traditional and original.   Food-wise, I highly recommend:  the mac and cheese balls  the country ham & hoe cakes the pimento burger - my current choice for best burger in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Wow suuuuuper amazing new fave for us!!! Awesome atmosphere, super cool design and food to die for!! Wife loved their house dressing on stacked salad. I killed the mussels with corn bread. And my favorite burger so far (even though not huge burger fan) but the sauce it was covered in and fresh tomatoes are delicious, potatoes sooooo good and sweet pickles. Great service too, James explained everything, and we had many questions lol"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome from food to drinks to knowledgeable service. Try Milk Was a Bad Choice for a different but great cocktail."}
{"text":"We tried it on a trip to Phoenix and liked it so much we came back the next night! We tried fried pork rinds spiced, braised greens - the pork in this had an awesome texture and flavor, Tennessee hot fried chicken - off the hook!, smoked chicken wings and coconut cream pie - AWESOME! And that was just the first night. On the second night we got chicken skins, fried dilly beans, fried chicken again and then the biscuit doughnut - stinkin' good"}
{"text":"OKRA dinner last night was FANTASTIC!!  It was a \"special\" Bourbon dinner paired with special Bourbon cocktails that was AWESOME & DELICIOUS!!!!  Can't say enough great things about this restaurant.  YOU MUST GIVE OKRA A TRY, if you haven't already.  Keep up the good, fantastic, & tasty work OKRA! :)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal and experience.  The atmosphere was fun and food delicious.  We had a few signature cocktails served up by Jake who was AWESOME.  Will come back and suggest you all visit."}
{"text":"Went there with a couple of friends for happy hour.   I can't find their menu on the 'net so I'll have to describe what I had versus the actual name.   We had the dilly beans, which we agreed was interesting but we barely ate it.   Since none of us is from the south, maybe it's not something we're used to.   String beans which tasted a lot of dill and deep fried was most interesting but to us not palatable.  We had the smoked chicken wings, which we agreed was quite smoky, but otherwise was not too tasty.  Left some of that on the serving platter as well.   Quite frankly, it could be it is not our collective tastes in food, but I know I, for one in our group, would not return.   The server was very efficient and friendly, and we liked her.   Very friendly bartender and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Where Okra was on point with their cocktails, the service I received while trying to enjoy a small bachelorette \"get together\" for my girlfriend was pretty disappointing. I had called ahead to make a reservation for 7:30 and they mentioned that they don't take reservations for that time, however we could make it for 8 o'clock instead. No issue there. The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything and I mentioned my friend's engagement and that we were going to bring a cake for her to enjoy. I also mentioned that we would be having mostly drinks and maybe some appetizers so that they didn't expect us to be enjoying a full coursed meal.  Arriving, our server Matthew seemed very unenthused to be helping us right away. Everyone enjoyed multiple cocktails and most ordered some sort of food. When I asked Matthew if we could have some small plates to split the cake, he mentioned that unless I called ahead and told them about the cake, we couldn't enjoy it inside the facilities. We did call ahead... Anyway, he \"talked to the manager\" and reported back that we couldn't do it. That's fine. So, I asked for some to-go silver wear so that we could enjoy the cake in the parking lot. Matthew's response: \"we don't have those\" My thought: \"you never have to-go orders??\" My friend kindly asked another server for some utensils and he easily retrieved them for us.   My point is: I'm not sure how or why we pissed off our server, but I've worked in the service industry for many years and I made sure to make it aware to everyone that we were there to enjoy cocktails and the company of our friends for the bachelorette. I will definitely be coming back to Okra for their delicious cocktails, but I will not prefer Matthew as my server."}
{"text":"Service was excellent as the staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. Drinks were on point too. I give three stars only because the food was above average. It didn't blow me away. Had the mac n cheese balls ($7), dilly beans ($7), mussels ($14), braised beef entree ($20) and the doughnut desert. Mussels and beef weren't worth the price. I hear this place can be inconsistent on food so maybe there are better options.  Will definitely come back, but probably only for drinks and a snack."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 10 stars for saving our 5-year anniversary. We went to a steakhouse earlier in the evening and had absolutely horrendous service (I was in tears because the disappointment my brain felt was leaking out of my eye sockets).   My amazing husband did not want to end on a low note and brought me (mentally kicking and screaming) to OKRA because he had met some guys from OKRA earlier in the day while he was out and about.   First off, I needed to fix my running mascara and a drink.... I am awful at ordering drinks in general. I don't really know what I like and generally stick with things I've heard ordered at other times in my life (vodka tonic, cuba libre, jack & coke, appletini...). In my frazzled state, I shared this tidbit of info with the barkeep (he is from the Detroit area but I forgot his name) and he suggested he could create something for me. Yay! A decision I don't have to make!!   From that moment on, they proceeded to spoil us. The cooks, the chef, the barkeep...the whole restaurant seemed to be conspiring to brighten our moods.   My drink was a mixture of muddled strawberries, Hendrick's gin, mint, basil, lemon juice and orange juice...I could have drank 2 gallons of it, it was soooooooooo perfect!    They then brought us dessert...a Canned Biscuit Doughnut topped with salted caramel and homemade buttermilk ice cream (OMG it was heavenly) and a slice of Buttermilk Pie (also very good!)   We were also allowed to try their pickled green beans (just because) and I loved that too. They are so good, I would like to have a big jar of them to put on salads.   I'm a fan...and quite possibly a devotee."}
{"text":"Skip this place folks! rude bar service & food. We tried the Pimento burger - Wish we would have gone to McDonald's. The fried chicken was way below average. The wings was also below average. This hyped up restaurant will fade out soon."}
{"text":"I'll keep this very simple and short:  Food: had stacked salad, chicken skins, cheese balls, the beef entree and the fried chicken entree. Not impressed with any of it. Mostly soggy, bland and too much corn bread. Beef was entirely a wad of fat. Menu looks good on paper but the execution needs work. Expected more from the Crudo gang.  Drinks: mediocre and inconsistent. Had several signature drinks and they were...well..meh. They are trying hard but just misses the mark.  Staff/Service: one word: OUTSTANDING.  Summary: The Phoenix culinary and cocktail scene has produced some outstanding establishments which has now raised the bar for the newcomers. Okra needs to step it up to join the ranks of the truly 5 star worthy establishments."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time last year and I really enjoyed it. The layout of Okra is really cute and warm, and is a great place for small family gatherings. The food was delicious but everything seemed a little richer than necessary, but it's always good to indulge once in a while! I tried to go for something lighter with the Avocado Toast which was insanely fresh tasting, making sure I still had something yummy with the Honey Coated Fried Chicken Skins on the side. These were so delicious but it felt like I was ruining my health more and more with every bite. The donut is what we chose for dessert and it was delicious but seriously so rich and sweet that the four of us couldn't bring ourselves to finish it. Definitely want to come back and explore more of the menu!"}
{"text":"All around amazing. GREAT SERVER, amazing mixologist at the bar happy to craft a custom concoction. I love the different approach and appreciate the fresh option in our neighborhood. Not a huge fan of southern food but this warrants a try when you're up for something different.   Ignore the little voice on your shoulder steering you away from the fried skins. It's a must try. The mussels are delightful as well. As for entree, the beef and potato dish was excellent and the hammock a unique, smokey experience. But let's get to what we loved best: THE BISCUIT DONUT DESSERT IS TO DIE FOR AMAZING. Tune out the voice that tells you to share dessert because trust me friend, you will want this one all to yourself. Do it! Don't share. Indulge. And work it off tomorrow once the sugar coma wears off..."}
{"text":"The chicken skin, nduja dates, Diablo ciabatta, dilly beans, bone marrow and pecan pie were fantastic. The biscuits were little heavy. The ambiance and bar a really nice."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. The oysters, the okra, everything is delicious. BUT the cocktails and donuts take the cake!"}
{"text":"After circling around for a while because the sign for okra was out front but the entrance and the restaurant is in the back of the place I finally got here with my girlfriend and sat at the unassuming bar that looked like it was built out of one piece of wood for aesthetic purposes (it's not really wood I don't think). We were greeted by a friendly bartender who gave us two menus, one for okra's awesome drinks and the other for their even better food. I was not sure what I wanted to drink so the bartender asked what type of alcohol I liked and then recommended the dog howl day drink (or something of that nature). It contains bourbon and citrus and mezcal and was amazing.    Now one thing about this place is it is not for people that are calorie counting or on a diet, it's for those of us who love good food. After drinks we proceeded to order food, and let me tell you their food is absolutely delicious, especially their fried chicken skins. I mean they take the best part of the chicken, batter it up, then deep fry it... Mmmmm makes my mouth water just thinking about this heart attack inducing appetizer, seriously a must have. I also had their brocollin with pistachio pesto and egg (one of the healthier things on the menu) and it was delicious, the egg is over easy so once you cut into it it mixes with the crispy brocollini and tastes amazing. Lastly we had the bone marrow with ox tail and biscuit, and as any good foodie place has a bone marrow okra's was divine. The ox tail sauce mixture was a perfect fitting with the bone marrow and biscuit.   Overall this place is delicious and their take on southern style cuisine is a perfect mix of new age foodie hipster and old style delicious unhealthy fair. If you are looking for an awesome meal then go here but don't count calories while eating you may have a heart attack."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some down home southern cooking this is the place. The short rib dinner is fantastic melt in your mouth goodness. One of the best short rib entrees I have ever had. All that and the waiter said it is his second favorite on the menu."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, witty bartenders, nice looking,and friendly. Bartenders are on point! Great date place. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We decided to hit up Okra Saturday at 5p and they have happy hour on the weekends so we decided to take advantage of it! A few weeks ago, we decided to visit for dinner and the restaurant was packed- they asked us if we had reservations and since we didn't, it was a 20 min wait. I didn't want to wait so we left and now, we are back!  The restaurant is small and doesn't hold very many people so if you do plan to visit, I recommend making reservations. Our server was friendly and we decided to order a hurricane and okra cup for our alcoholic beverages! The hurricane was strong and both of them were really good!   We proceeded to order: fried chicken skins, hush puppies, pimento burger, and the red hot. We really enjoyed everything that was put on our table and I left the establishment with a little nice buzz. It was great!!   Total of our bill: a little over $39."}
{"text":"Okra was good, but not quite as good as I was hoping. I love southern food so I was eager to try this place. It was empty when we arrived, but it was a weekday. When I asked about cocktails, our server confessed that he was too young to partake. I totally understand that, but all servers should have knowledge of each part of the menu, regardless if they actually eat/drink the item. We were not super hungry so we decided to order apps and dessert!  We tried the hoe cakes, fried chicken skin, the biscuit doughnut, and a slice of apple pie with ice cream. The canned biscuit doughnut was by far my favorite item! I could have eaten 5 of them!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my friends birthday. First off, the front door is in the back of the building which made it difficult to find. When we walked in there weren't many people so we were seated immediately. We made it right before happy hour ended so we had to put our orders in fast. The waitress was nice enough to let me order two drinks at happy hour pricing and told the bartender not to make the 2nd drink until I was ready. The drinks were good and strong and probably saved the meal because the food was not memorable.  We ordered wings for the table which would have been good if they had some salt. We all ordered burgers which again, could have been better if there was salt on them. My friend got a slice of pie for desert which was pretty good and then the waitress gave us some complimentary doughnuts which were very good. Overall, we had a nice time because the staff was awesome and the drinks were strong but the food was just not impressive."}
{"text":"This place closed down, as it should. Terrible. This was my review from Open Table a few months ago:  The food is just OK, nothing special. If anything, overpriced. Our tab was $125 with tip. The menu online was different from what we experienced. The menu items we saw online were the main reason we came in the first place, only to find that the items that intrigued us were not on the menu. Even now the online menu is not at all accurate.   Now the biggest issue of all. We didn't get all of our leftovers. We had ordered several small plates so we didn't finish all of our dinners. I had the 3-pc chicken dinner and our server decided that I only needed to take home 1 piece. I had picked at all three pieces, but did not even come close to finish my dinner. I may have eaten 1/4 of it if that. So I got 1 piece of my $20 3-piece chicken dinner to go. How does that happen? If you are boxing leftovers, put everything in the box. Let the customer decide what they want to keep or not. It doesn't take a college degree to work in a restaurant, just common sense. Apparently our server didn't have any. FYI, this place is owned by Crudo, another overpriced and overrated restaurant."}
{"text":"Okra overall was a great experience, fairly busy on a Friday night and we ended up sitting at the bar top (which also offers the full menu).   To start, we ordered a dirty martini and Julius freeze to drink! 5/5 stars. Both were made excellently and very delicious. The bartender was very precise in each and every drink, and I was tempted to order every cocktail on the menu.  Appetizers:  - Hush puppies 3/5 stars. The goat cheese was what really sold this dish, whipped to perfection.  - Mac & cheese balls, 3/5 stars. The outside was crunchy and crisp, and the Mac and cheese inside was tasty. The marina was very basic, like something I could have found at the grocery store. - Bone marrow, my favorite. 5/5 stars! I've never eaten bone marrow, and the flavor was amazing. The texture was very smooth as well. The only complaint, was there wasn't enough!  Main Course: - Verde Pot Pie: 4/5 stars. The crust was the right amount of crisp on the outside and cooked perfection on the inside. The gravy was darker than anticipated but still had a wonderful hearty flavor. - Fried Chicken (Tennessee hot): 5/5 stars. The sauce was my boyfriends favorite hot sauce he EVER had. On par with our favorite chicken sauces (found at Welcome Chicken & Donuts)."}
{"text":"So, I'm from Georgia and am always looking for some good Southern cooking. We decided to try Okra last night based on the menu I found on their website. While the two menus differed greatly, the website menu did indicate the type and style of food offered, so it was not a biggie.   We were greater haphazardly, as if we interrupting the server's evening (and it wasn't because they were in a rush...There were only 3 other small tables) This feeling continued throughout the entire evening. We sat outside and were the only ones out there.   I ordered a tea and my husband, a beer. I was told it would be a while on the tea as they needed to brew it. It was 7pm in the evening.   We ordered 2 starters - Peel and Eat Shrimp and Brussels with BBQ Lamb Necks.   We enjoyed the patio, but it was quiet and we had a nice view of various staff taking smoke breaks.   My tea was brought to me and it was Green tea, which I found interesting, especially considering it was a Southern restaurant. When our server sat it down, he said, \"If you want to sweeten it, don't use the raw sugar because it won't dissolve.\" Luckily, I didn't, as there was no other real sugar alternatives.   We received our starters and they looked delish. However, looks can be deceiving. The BBQ Lamb was DELICIOUS! It reminded me of a mix between burnt ends and pot roast. No gaminess at all. The Brussels were still raw and hard and actually tasted quite old. The shrimp sauce was very flavorful. The shrimp, however, were grossly overcooked or had been in the fridge for a day or two too long. They definitely were not freshly boiled, shocked, and put on ice. The bed of pickled veggies that the shrimp sat on were very good! Would love those on a bahm mi!   We never were asked if we wanted to order entrées, so we asked if we could. We decided on the 2 piece fried chicken w/ChowChow and a side of fried okra and I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak that came with Collards and butterbeans. When I ordered it, our server exclaimed, \"It's real steak!\" To which I laughed and said, \"I hope so...\"   We waited for our entrées for an extremely long time (more than 30 min). Again, only 2 or 3 small tables other than ours who had been there when we arrived. There was no asking of if we wanted to order drinks or even being checked on by the server during this long time.   A few minutes before our dinner arrived, music for the patio finally was turned on. It was MUCH needed, as we didn't even have the chatter of other patrons around.   Dinner was served. Beautiful looking food again. The fried chicken was MASSIVE, like hanging off the plate. However, it was difficult to eat because it kept falling off the plate. Also, the crust all fell off in one large chunk when cut into. The meat was moist but lacked flavor, as did the crust. Salt and pepper would have helped a lot. The ChowChow was very good. The fried okra also needed salt (and we aren't \"salt\" people).   My chicken fried steak was okay. The steak was well done, unfortunately, and, like the chicken, the crust all came off in one piece. The collards were undercooked, in my opinion... we boil them til they are soft in the South. They still had a bit of snap to them when you took a bite. The butterbeans were good but not memorable. The 'dirty sauce,' as it was called on the menu was broken and not very appealing.   Dessert saved the evening. We ordered the canned biscuit doughnut. I was excited to see that, as my momma made those for us when we were younger. It did not disappoint! The Salted Caramel was not overly sweet and a true caramel. The biscuit was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Sooooooo good!   I would go back to sit at the bar (in order to have better service) and just order a cocktail (although I didn't have one last night, the menu looked great and had some new takes on old classics) and doughnut."}
{"text":"All of us have our favorite places and chefs....and when we learned that Crudo chef Cullen Campbell and partners (Maureen and Micah) had developed a second concept, we had to check it out. Last night was our second time there...and it is in this place that you have an even greater appreciation of this chef's heart and soul.  Returning to his background in southern inspired food, Chef Campbell has created one of the best-ever comfort food places in the Valley. Fried dilly beans (think wonderfully lightly tempura coating on fresh pickled green beans) with comeback sauce, smoked chicken wings that are served with \"homeboy's and white bbq sauce,\" potlikker mussels with cornbread that just begs to be swiped in a delicious broth, oysters al forno with garlic butter parsley and Noble bread, and a pimiento cheese burger with tomato and comeback sauce...served with fingerlings instead of fried....amazingly good!. The first tine there, we tried his hot chicken which we had sampled before at the seven chef Foul Out dinner. This time, we tried his Saturday special (he will always have a BBQ special on Saturdays) chicken served with mustardy potato salad and a Koollickle....yes...and it was delicious. While we typically don't have desserts out, a fresh pear brown sugar pie (whipped cream of course), and a canned biscuit doughnut with a salted caramel sauce was just so good. As is always the case with us, service and people are about as important as the food, Patty was our guide and did a masterful job.  I marvel at great chef's talents, and Chef Campbell is one of the best....but when there is a presence of their heart and spirit on the plate...things become stupidly good!!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but this was definitely a disappointment!  This is a southern style restaurant? First if you are called Okra maybe you should serve okra, Not just regular plain okra.. FRIED Okra isn't that what they eat in the south? They don't even have regular iced tea!!! Some people don't like green tea...( thats all they serve is green tea).  The four of us tried a lot of the items on the menu and everything was just plain greasy and not good. The chicken skins, I can't believe they serve these this is a heart attack on a plate. We will not be returning, their are other spots in the valley to get good southern style food."}
{"text":"If you care about quality food, unique flavor pairings, sharing a bite or two between your fellow diners then Okra is for you! If you're looking for a plate full of slopped pulled pork or some brisket hidden under a sauce and sides to feed an army you may want to pass on the artistry being created by Chef Cullen. Our server Michelle was amazing! Not only did she know the menu in and out but she really had a passion for what was on there! It's always refreshing to see a servers eyes light up when describing a dish, and actually be invested in what she was talking about! I highly recommend asking for Michelle, you will not be disappointed!  Now to the food! These will not be big giant feed your face plates, you are going to get a serving of some real passion and love of flavors, a southern background mixed with some Italian flair. It may sound daunting but please please try it and see for yourself how great a combination these two can be!   Stacked salad to start, of course not a tradition Caesar but the flavors are robust and delicious and the corn bread croutons will make you never look at a normal crouton the same!    Verde focaccia to share, excellent use of goat cheese, you get a good flavor but not over powering mixed with the pesto was on point! Crust was cooked perfectly nice and crispy but wasn't over done.   Pimento burger to my self! I have to say I've had this burger numerous times I can't seem to get enough of this. Excellent flavors; the homeboys comeback sauce, the pickles, pimento cheese all mixed in to each delicious bite after bite. I would definitely recommend this to be one of the best burgers in the valley and would put it up against any others you might hold near and dear to your heart.    Overall you can tell the creators have a pure joy of food making this a very special spot in Phoenix, please go and try it! Be open minded don't get stuck thinking you can only have one plate a certain way liven up your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"Nice place for dinner and drinks. A bit on the small side, and if I recall correctly the dining area is kind of narrow. I like the open kitchen look, where guests can see their meal on progress. The entrance is kind of weird around the back."}
{"text":"To celebrate my wife's birthday we had dinner at Okra, and started off with happy hour drinks, mint juleps for both, very nice, reminded us of mojitos. We then had the fried chicken skins, which were served piping hot from the fryer, and coated with a honey-pepper sauce that was awesome! Wife had the pickled, breaded fried green beans served with \"comeback\" sauce that was very delicious. For entrees she had the short ribs, that were out of this world good, and I had the chioppino, which was boiled shrimp and grilled cornbread that I used to sop up every bit of the sauce. For dessert, and in honor of her birthday, the server brought a canned biscuit donut, covered in salty caramel. Very delicious, and thoughtful. Overall, a wonderful experience, great service, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm willing to admit that this review is a bit premature, considering we only had drinks. However, my husband and I had such a great experience at the bar, I think Okra deserves my 5 stars. We ordered a couple of the signature cocktails (all excellent, and with great recommendations from the bartender), beer from the limited menu, and proceeded to talk whiskey with the very friendly owner and bartender for the next hour and a half. They had a great selection of whiskeys and bourbons (all southern, in keeping with the theme), and the owner was extremely knowledgeable, and even let us try a couple. I love the Crown shopping center location, and the ambiance is awesome: southern and rustic without being overdone. Prices are average and pretty great during happy hour (too bad we didn't make that). Can't wait to go back and try some food."}
{"text":"In the mood to try something new, my girlfriend and I took a trip deep into the heart of the currently booming 7th Street scene in order to give Okra a try.  Okra offers a bit of a unique experience. Their food is heavily influenced by the South, while also incorporating some Italian flare into the mix. The servers all wear rock band shirts and the music seems to be on a continuous 80s loop (not that I'm complaining). If they're trying to be unique without going completely over-the-top, I feel that they succeed.  But the real question is: How's the food?  We started with some fried chicken skins with a mildly spiced honey sauce. This is the first restaurant we've ever visited in Phoenix that offers stand-alone skins as a dish. We both liked it, although I later wondered - what do they do with all of the leftover (skinless) chicken afterwards?  For our main meals, I ordered a pimento burger. Strangely enough, the server did not ask me how I wanted my burger cooked. It was brought out to me at medium-rare level, which I think is a pretty ballsy assumption to make without asking. The burger was okay. There's another restaurant that offers some incredible pimento that has since become our gold standard. This stuff wasn't quite up to par, but it wasn't exactly bad by any means. Fries seemed very hollow and airy, impressing neither myself or my girlfriend. The overall meal was okay, but probably not something I'd order again.  My girlfriend opted for the fried chicken, with a side of Umbrian sauce to sample. Honestly, I'm still not sure why some of these cheap places can totally nail their fried chicken, while some of these joints charge 20 bucks for a three piece meal and can only produce a mediocre-flavored bird. Once again, it was okay, but we both agreed that we've found better elsewhere for less coin.  For dessert, they have two options, including a canned biscuit donut and pie from Pie Snob (which is kind of cheating). We opted for the biscuit, which is exactly what it says. A canned biscuit that's been fried and formed into a donut, which is then covered in salted caramel. We like biscuits and damn sure love donuts, but this just wasn't our thing. It kind of reminds me of those crioscants in the sense that, it's something being made into a dessert against its own will. Still, I give them credit for their creativity.  Service was nothing memorable. No refills on soda or water. A nearby table had a guy who seemed a bit more enthusiastic than our girl, who came off as bored and robotic.  With all that said, I still think people should at least try Okra. While it might be a great fit for some people, I doubt it's a place we'd ever return to. I see it simply as a one-time stop to cross off on our local list. It ain't bad, but it's not particularly great either.  Nevertheless, I'd recommend trying them at least once."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Okra for Happy Hour and we loved it! They had a great selection of appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised to find several vegetarian options on their menu, since southern food is usually not vegetarian friendly. We shared the mac n cheese balls, hush puppies, and fried dilly beans. All very delicious. My husband also had the chicken skins. He was in heaven. The cocktails were great. Very potent. Service was great. Warm, hospitable, and helpful with the menu. Try their hot sauce! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So, we're big fans of Crudo and finally got around to checking out their new place.  Location tip: access to Okra is off Palo Verde Drive, just east of 7th Street. A brand new building.  Okra is the polar opposite of Crudo with a couple of important exceptions.  Exception #1. Quality and presentation. The quality I get. I've come to expect nothing short of amazing from Chef Cullen & crew. All the dishes we sampled in our party of four were killer. Grilled Okra starter, shareable pleases: fried chicken skins (not as good as the signature fried pig ears at Crudo, but tasty nonetheless), mussels & cornbread (I could eat a loaf of the cornbread in a bowl of milk, so good!). Entrées: pig cheek pot pie, fried chicken Umbrian style, pork osso buco & braised beef rib. Finished everything off with a delicious caramel biscuit dessert. All very amazing.  The bar area is smallish but well tended in a manner you would expect from these guys.  The icing on the cornbread is the VERY reasonable price point for this fare.  Exception #2. The service was superb as anticipated. Jack, our bartender and Kyl, our server were terrific.  We can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Crudo, so when I heard about Okra I knew I had to try it! So when I popped online and checked out their menu and saw Fried Chicken Skins with Honey Hot Sauce, I knew this was going to be a dangerous love affair. I mean seriously lets all be honest here... The best part of the fried chicken is that delicious crunchy exterior that has been deep fried to golden perfection! I mean if it wasn't, why would we order fried chicken and not just eat a boring chicken breast.... anyways getting off point here.  The restaurant itself is nice and modern, we sat on the patio since it was a beautiful spring night. Service was amazing (make sure you ask for Michelle!), cocktails were killer (old fashioned was on point but the real winner was the sazerac)  Being the fatties we are we ordered a plethora of food - because why not try it all! Obviously we ordered the fried chicken skins with the hot honey sauce, which is a must. The oysters al griglia were a serious home run! The conspicuous amounts of butter and garlic in those tiny bad boys was what oyster dreams are made of. Those oysters can know that they died for a noble cause. The smoked chicken wings were good not great, and the bone marrow with biscuits and ox tail and pepper jam at what dreams are made of.   Their smoked ham hock is the the true stand out of the evening... braised, smokey, tender, are all words i can use to describe this dish. No need for a knife here - its literally a fall off the bone delectable treat,   And after all of this, we still ate dessert! Donuts. I ended my meal with a donut covered in more salted caramel than should be legal! Not that I am complaining. Next time I want to take that donut and cover it with a piece of their chicken skin.  So if your looking for killer food, great drinks and a fun atmosphere where you can take your taste buds on a wild food ride than should be street legal, Okra is your spot!"}
{"text":"Good things: service was excellent and location very good. Patio seating was nice.   Bad things: the food. Small portions of not so great and very expensive food. If you are going to call yourself okra and say you serve southern comfort food, you should have fried okra on the menu. In retrospect we should have gone to churches chicken and bought a bottle of scotch for a much better meal at a tenth of the price."}
{"text":"I went to Okra last night with a couple of my girlfriends and was extremely disappointed with the experience I had. Perhaps they were having an off night but I don't think I will be returning to this spot again.   After being seated, I ordered a drink off the Happy Hour menu. When I asked for the drink, the Waiter said \"No, you can't have that\" I laughed, thinking he was joking, ordered it again and he said \"No, bourbon and champagne don't belong together\" and insisted I ordered another drink. Ok...I was a little thrown off so I ordered a Manhattan (which was very good). Take it off your menu or let people order what they want.   When my friends arrived, we ordered food and more drinks. The food was alright, very overpriced and nothing special. A salad with feta and tomato slices shouldn't run upwards of $10, especially in Phoenix, but it tasted fine.   After a couple drinks each and small plates, our bill came to $90. Pretty pricey for the quality but I paid the bill and tipped nicely. It was Friday night at 7 and the place was filling up but not crazy, there were open tables and outside seating and we were still finishing our drinks when the manager came over to our table and ASKED US TO LEAVE because they were desperate for tables. This is the main reason for writing my review. He didn't ask to move to the bar or if we wanted to sit outside, he asked if we could finish up and go. How RUDE. There was one party at the door, we had only just finished up and we were having a nice conversation. We are moms and barely ever get to go out and we're shoved out the door despite open tables and spending $100 in their restaurant.   I have lived in New York and other major cities and this has never happened to me. Get over yourself, Okra."}
{"text":"My experience here was great!! Thank you James for the amazing service!!!     Celebrated my birthday here and it was great!  The best part of Okra was the service we got from James. It is quite amazing to have someone serve you who is truly passionate about what they do. It is clear that the chef at okra is passionate about food and it's clear that the ownership is passionate about service and this passion is seen in the food and and service.   The food was great, the atmosphere is super cool and trendy. Great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely our new favorite place! Chef Michael is amazing! We had our second visit today and proved to be rock-solid...they even looked for my husbands phone! Great staff! (Jeff)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  Hurricane, $7 during happy hour: OKRA rum blend [1], passion fruit, and lemon.  The rums were strong, the fruity mix was definitely tart, and the fresh ground nutmeg on top was a nice touch.  I contemplated on ordering another, it was that good (!), but decided I'd like to be able to drive home after. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=w6l2Viw7rThMYYMHUP8L_w  Fried Chicken Skins & Honey Hot Sauce, $4 during hh:  Ooh-ee!  Perfectly battered, deep-fried, and drizzled with their honey-habanero sauce.  Delicious!  A definite must-try.  I didn't think it could be improved anymore, but I tried the OKRA hot sauce made in house (a bottle to take home is only $10) that Brennan brought over, and oh, my! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=EJfM0XqszVqjV4bLm6ImeQ  Braised Greens & Calabrian Pork Bites, $6: Braised collard greens and onions, and pork belly first braised in a mirepoix, then deep-fried.  Beautiful, piquant greens, vinegary pork, and I loved the meaty crunch, yet melt-in-your-mouth pork belly fat.  I rarely enjoy ingesting fat, but when prepared this way, I will gladly do so. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=Kn-XULQ5x800pSyKyQpGpQ  Buttermilk Meatballs: Pork and beef mix, on a bed of polenta, but I had mine substituted with grilled broccolini [2].  Delicious, and definitely homemade.  The tomato sauce was both sweet and tangy, and the char from the broccolini added a smokiness to the entire meal.  Spied huge chunks of pork fat, but didn't mind.  Appreciated the fresh-grated cheese on top.  Had grilled Noble bread added (+$3), but they were too charred for me.  I tried one, but didn't care for it and had asked Brennan to take them away, but he offered to exchange the original four charred pieces with two non-grilled pieces...  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/okra-cookhouse-and-cocktails-phoenix?select=9yrrppg1ps1dMN3Uee9lhw  Thanks to GM Dan S. and sous chef Curtis for introducing themselves and for showing courtesy, patience, and understanding, as well as to bartender Brennan, who was very pleasant to converse with and was empathetic, as he too grappled with a few food issues of his own.  Also, I needed a bandage after losing the one I had on after washing my hands, so I asked Brennan if there was one that the kitchen could spare.  He kindly went back to look for some, and came back to let me know that someone had used the very last one that afternoon, but that he'd go \"next door to ask for a couple.\"  What great customer service!  [1] Had emailed for allergen info earlier this afternoon and received a reply from GM Dan Scheuring in less than an hour.  (I'm impressed!  Most restaurants take at least a day, or two, and some don't respond at all.  Kudos to OKRA's staff!!)  I had planned on taking advantage of another restaurant's late brunch hours, but because Dan had taken the time to consult with Sous Chef Alex Curtis regarding menu items that included specific allergens I'd asked about AND attached a list of items from all three food menus (snacks, shares, and bigs) \"that would be friendly\" to me, I decided to drive out to OKRA on this very hot day (high of 118!) and see what culinary delights I would find.    [2] The menus kindly state no substitutions and only omissions will be granted, so I'm very grateful that Dan and sous chef Curtis worked with me to make my first visit positively memorable.    p.s.  OKRA was a little tricky to find, since the signage on 7th St. was small (the letters for OKRA do not take a lot of space), and another signage said \"around the back.\"  It's not behind Mary Coyle's, but in the corner behind the Phoenix Ale Brewery space on 7th and Palo Verde.  Impressive parking lot- much appreciated!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour on Friday afternoon/evening. They had some great deals and delicious finger foods!"}
{"text":"Not sure what I was expecting but the food was average. Had the tomato salad - tomatoes were mealy. Ordered a side of mashed potatoes - tasted bland and like some fish had snuck in them which threw the flavor off. We also tried the fried chicken skins - the crispy batter had a good flavor but the skins were soft and chewy - again, not my fave. I would like to go back and try the dessert menu. That may be the safest bet."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Horrible service, and mediocre food. Our appetizers arrived before our drinks. The server never checked back with us so we were not able to even order a second drink. The parking lot was empty with only a few tables occupied on a Sunday, that should have been a red flag right there. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's bit hard to locate, as other reviews have mentioned, but it does have a nice big parking lot, huge plus. The decor, as my boyfriend characterized it, is hipster 101 -- nothing original, but clean, comfortable, and welcoming. The house cocktails are phenomenal -- we had the Seabach, border-crosser, and a manhattan, and all were well balanced. The bartenders definitely know their stuff.  And the food is worth the trip -- the stacked salad is crisp, fresh, and properly dressed, and the pecans are a nice touch. The focaccia is really a pizza, which is not a problem for me, but set your expectations accordingly. The verde is quite good, the crust is properly charred, thin in the center with a large, fluffy cornicione. My one complaint would be that the ratio of rim to toppings is a bit off, and a bit more topping would be nice. The fried chicken is excellent, shatteringly crispy crust with moist, tender chicken underneath, and the cornbread that comes with it (while a bit sweet) is good companion. Ditto for the mussels, which are plump and cooked to appropriate doneness. And the housemade hot sauce is fantastic, but beware the totally open top to the bottle.... Overall, a solid 4-4.5 stars, and a great addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails as expected from the people who brought you Crudo. Despite only being open 3 weeks they were full the entire time I was there from about 5-8. Dilly beans are a must have, as well as the fried chicken skin. Both are small snacks which we got at the bar. I also ordered a mint julep which was refreshing. For my main I had the catfish which was good. Wasn't blown away by it though. For dessert a fantastic bourbon pecan pie. I will definately come back, and reccomend it to my friends and family as well."}
{"text":"Love the small bites, enables you to try many dishes. My favorite was the fried chicken skin and the pork belly bites. For dinner we split the pig cheek pot pie. Add the hot sauce and it is divine. I was happy this place is more down to earth and accessible to common folk. The food is comforting and unpretentious. Definitely must try."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Cocktails. Small plates to share. Smoked wings. Pork bites with greens. Foccocia. Donut in carmel sauce. Great service. Good prices. It was packed on a Monday night. My new fav place."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome from the cocktails to the appetizers to the main entree to the dessert. Outstanding!!! The ham hock was meat fall off the bone good and the beef short rib literally melted in your mouth! I will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing ambiance .  The decor is wonderful open airy and fun.  We had the signature grilled okra and fried chicken skin.  If you like okra you will like it grilled.  The fried chicken skins could have been crispier for us, but the honey drizzle was a pleasant surprise.  We both had the Okra Cup cocktail.  Very light and refreshing.  My hubby had the catfish.  It was a big hit.  He didn't want the succotash but I gobbled it up - more okra! I had the beef brasato.  This is beef belly, slow cooked and yummy.  The veggies and sauce were a side note, not as good as my succotash.  My husband also had the chicken Umbrian style (regular fried).  He said it was good but the catfish was his favorite.  Finished with the salt caramel donut, heavy but good.  Would come back, many other things I want to try on the menu.  The address is on 7th St but you have to go around back. It is in the old Crown Imports location.  Almost forgot, my husband wanted the skins crispier and with the honey on the side. The mint juleps looked good too!"}
{"text":"The service is always top notch. The fried okra is delicious (it's not on their menu) and the cocktails are unique. My fave is the braised short ribs...I like the high tops next to the bar....great energy."}
{"text":"I don't want my 3 star review to deter you, I would still suggest trying, even just for a drink. I think the atmosphere at Okra was awesome - laid-back and cozy, with a southern feel. The staff was helpful and polite. The drink menu is filled with a good amount specialty drinks, which I appreciate. I tried a couple of the specialty cocktails and both were very good. I thought the food was okay, not bad, but I wouldn't necessarily return for the dishes I tried. The chicken skins were the favorite at the table. The hot chicken just wasn't as crispy as I hoped and I think it needed a little more heat. The beef short rib itself was good, but the fonduta with it didn't work for me. Overall I'd give it a 3.5 if possible. I would recommend going out and trying it. And I will return to try a few more dishes!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Fishin In The Dark)  Cocktails serving brews coming up tonight,  Juleps at the bar Chickens are frying and pork bellies are floating in the breeze  Bo Bites get ready.....  Across the room where the cook turns plates with the old stone grill I'm gonna go to a special place that everyone should know  Bo Bites get ready....OoooooOooo  Yelp and me going to Okra Cookhouse Singing our tunes and drinking at the bar Where the bourbon flows  Down by Phoenix at The Crown on 7th We'll be dining Southern eats in the evening lights Just grooving slow....   Okra is a family friend of Crudos apparently -- wink!  I came here with a friend and at first we were both kind of lost since there was still construction going on.  However, once we found the entrance we were relieve to find a cute comforting restaurant!  We sat at the high top tables next to the bar since we wanted a view.  We started off with some cocktails since you can't turn down an award winning mixologist in the house!  I went for the Spirit Animal; tequila, sherry, lime, apple and pear bitters.  Overall, a solid drink to wet my palates for what's to come.  My partner ordered the Pina Tail on the Donkey; Appleton rum, Bacardi, smith & cross rum, mint and pineapple syrup.  Needless to say, it was a strong drink, beautifully poured, fun to look at, and fun to drink!  For our food we shot for the Hush Puppies to start and for the entree we ordered the Smoked Pork Osso Bucco and Catfish.  We both totally dig the hush puppies; soft within and crunchy cover while the goat cheese gave it a hint of creamy sweetness.  The pickled salad provided a sour punch.  My smoked pork came in an impressive style presentation; pretty much felt like I was going to eat a brontosaurus leg (yab-da-ba do!).  The meat was super tender and fell off the bone while the greens and black eye peas below which provided some extra flavors of sourness to the subtle meaty entree.  My partner's catfish dish was baked and came on a bed of okra succotashed gremolata.  She said it was good but was lacking in spice and flavors.  Overall, we love the originally of the food, but the lack flavors in certain aspects.  Drink selections was good and service was phenomenal! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Checked out Happy Hour (4-6) during their soft opening, and they didn't let me down!  Okra brings a unique atmosphere to the midtown area with a combination of Southern comfort food, twists on Italian favorites, and a down-to-earth atmosphere that juxtaposes high quality ingredients with inviting hospitality. They could serve these craft cocktails and eclectic eats in an exclusive, dimly-lit lounge, but instead make it accessible, with its hard rock and sports.   This could be a surprisingly good place to watch college football, just as long as they're not big on the SEC!  I indulged more in the safer side of the respectable cocktail menu. With prices as low as $6 a pop for some of these, it's an hour happier than most. Sazerac was on point. The milk punch was unique and refreshing, although it left me wanting for a little more depth beyond the delicious cognac. I cannot recall the tequila-based treat I enjoyed from the more premium concoctions, but it certainly left a great first impression.  The couple of appetizers I had were cool. This is the only place I've seen this side of the Mississippi rocking fried chicken skins. The honey hot sauce coating them is grand! I tried one of their focaccias, which are really pizzas, and while the ingredients were good, there was a bit of a flavor mismatch. Sweet and salty doesn't work with everything! Additionally, I couldn't imagine ever paying full price for these, as they're up to $14, which would certainly get you something bigger and better elsewhere. No worries, however, as there are lots and lots of options I am sure could please anyone.  I'll be back with a bigger appetite, and some cautious optimism for some twists on classic dishes. Until then, this definitely has my endorsement for a solid day drinking spot."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this dinner... sad to say it was just okay.  We ordered the bone marrow and ox tail to start.  This was actually really good.  For the main course we got braised beef/hoe cake dish.  Lacking flavor in a real way.  The carrots, hoe cake and yam were dull while the beef was tender yet lacked flavor.  We went with the donut for dessert.  This was also a let down.  The salt granules were so large and totally overpowered the donut, which also lacked caramel.   I would however come back for the drinks and ambiance!  Also, seamless and super attentive service!"}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place since I've heard about it.   Coming from a southerner herself, the food was made to perfection. We had the fried macnchz bites, a burger and fried chicken. I also got a side of mashed potatoes and I have no clue how they make theirs,but they were AMAZING. The cocktails were also great.   Only downside about this place was that the server was not very familiar with the menu. From an individual that was in the service industry, I think it is extremely important to know simple things like if your restaurant has ranch or not. Note this didn't change my rating of the restaurant as a whole.  Cannot wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"If you like southern comfort food like your grandmother used to make- you need to eat here.   Not a place to go if you're dieting. This is a cheat meal place!! The \"snacks\" are a tapas style presentation of smaller plates to share. We had chicken skins, friend green beans, the nduja dates (), hush puppies, country ham and hoe cakes. Literally you can not order wrong. We shared the chicken and dumplings for dinner and it was nostalgic! Just like Grandmom used to make .   You cannot leave before ordering the salted Carmel donut. They make it to order and it's hot and sweet and perfect. This place is incredible!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and it's a solid spot.   Surprised that it isn't more busy given that the drinks and food are good.   Their old fashioned during happy hour is a fantastic deal.  They also have a nice selection of other bourbons if you want to grab something neat or on the rocks.   The fried chicken skins are always a nice snack to have and when they have their oysters in season, those are also worth getting."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Main point of comparison here is to Southern Rail here in the Valley, and I could compare it to some other Southern joints in the South on a dish-bu-dish comparison.  Both here and Southern Rail are 4 stars, but I give Okra the slight edge.  My wife and I love the food of Chef Cullen Campbell.  When we heard that Crudo would have a sister restaurant, it made total sense that he would go Southern.  (I can wax philosophically on the intersection of Southern, Italian, and Korean food for a while but I'll spare you.)  The bar program at Crudo is great, it's no less great here.  Especially if you are looking for whiskey and bourbon based cocktails.  (Secret which i don't really want to share - they have Pappy.)  We've ordered a fair amount of dishes off the menu, so here's a quick rundown:  'Nduja dates - Salty/sweet combo in a small sticky package, it is fine. Fried head cheese - We're gettin' truly Southern here, and I would recommend you get this. Calabrian pork bites and greens - A little heavy-handed as an app, it's rich and filling. Fried chicken skins - These are tasty little treats.  Reminds me of the skins at Husk in Charleston. Fried dilly beans - THIS IS THE ONE.  So, so great.  Comeback sauce, awesome.   Smoked chicken wings - Quite tasty.  Not crispy at all, but the smoke on these suckers is great. Bone marrow biscuits - We love marrow but this, too, was a little heavy-handed.  Very rich. Pimento cheese burger - A sloppy mess but a decent burger.  Pimento could be a little stronger. Tennessee hot chicken - Falls short of Nashville, but the chicken was not dry and it was spicy enough. Chicken and dumplings - one of the best entrees here.  Chicken is flavorful as is the broth. Smoked ham hock - Heavy and satisfying.  Don't think I cold eat it in the summer, but it is well smoked and the black eyed peas and greens round out a good Southern meal.  So yeah, generally we like all the food, with some truly outstanding dishes there in the mix.  Mix in a couple cocktails and the meal will ring true to Southerners and Southerners at heart."}
{"text":"Came in here for my birthday with my parents, and was so excited to eat here after seeing the reviews on yelp. We were seated right away, our waiter came up to us and got us waters, but then took 15 minutes to come back and ask for our drink order. It wasn't very busy, we were one of maybe 4 tables in the restaurant, and I watched our drinks come up while our waiter seemed to frantically run around the restaurant. The bartenders weren't busy at all, just leaning back talking to each other while I stared at our three drinks. Finally we got our drinks. Then I see our order go out and be placed on another table.  then back to the kitchen. Then out to our table. I ordered the 2 piece fried chicken and it's incredibly underwhelming. So dry and unflavorful.  I asked for hot sauce, waiter forgot it. I gave my plate back to the kitchen. Just... not a good experience. Especially for my birthday. Was hoping to have a good time with my parents, and a bad night turned into a worse and more frustrating night. Don't think I'll be coming back here... the waiter is really nice and offered us dessert and apologized about the food and slower service, but just annoyed with how the night went overall."}
{"text":"My buddy wanted to take me here to try some cocktails, which is a great reason to go anywhere. We sat at the bar and ordered a Whiskey Sour. Had to be the best cocktail I ever had! The typical sour mix was avoided altogether for a gourmet method which led a smooth, creamy texture overall. Fantastic! We also had some of their happy hour specials which was not your typical bar food.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a rewarding whetting of the whistle Cheers!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was very attentive to my needs since I follow a vegan diet. This was a plus for the house! Had a \"stacked salad\" with pecans and a focaccia with marinara. Both absolutely delicious! The focaccia was wood fire baked perfectly. A wonderful meal! That combined with a great atmosphere and a pretty good crowd made for a wonderful experience overall."}
{"text":"This was a great, random find on Yelp! I was in town for work, so I am not familiar with the area. The name caught my eye, and the menu and review had me sold. The restaurant atmosphere was trendy and had a good vibe. The drinks were great. The food was awesome. We ordered several items, all were excellent, but the personal favorites were the fried dilly beans and the canned biscuit donut with sea salt caramel glaze. Out of this world! The service was excellent, our server Kyle was awesome and provided good recommendations. This was a great find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"OMG!!  I really love this place.  I've been here twice within like a month.  I really wasn't expecting this spot to be anything.  But me and my brother have restaurant battles and he definitely 1 up'd me with this one.  The exterior design of Okra is so cool, very simple, modern and upscale look/feeling.  You walk through the hallway and enter the restaurant and you are welcomed with the savory smells of their fantastic food.  My favorite part was the bar (I promise i'm not an alchy lol) where they make amazing hand crafted drinks.  I honestly can't tell you the names of all the drinks we had except for their version of a pisco sour.  What I can tell you is that you will never be disappointed with any of them.  Side note, ask for the dates and the fried chicken skins, oh my goodness!  I can not express how awesome this place is.  I will make this a ritual to come here at least once a month lol.  Keep up the great work guys!!"}
{"text":"Visited on a weeknight for some fried chicken. Was definitely disappointed with the fried chicken - the breading was MUCH too dense and overpowered the chicken. I felt like I got so full on the breading I wasn't able to enjoy and truly taste too much of the chicken. Should you give it a try, I'd say split it between 2 people. It's much too large a portion for 1. The Chow Chow & Honey is quite sweet - be warned. The TN Hot is their variation of Nashville Hot chicken, but not quite there.  We also tried the fried green tomatoes and fried chicken skins for appetizers - both were good. The chicken skins were definitely a special treat since we don't consumer those too often. The highlight of the night.  Craft cocktails were tasty and unique.  We left a bit annoyed at the service as it wasn't busy and the server couldn't remember our names even after 3 times of reminding him (we are friendly and conversational with waitstaff)."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing first time. We were immediately impressed with the ambiance and location as we arrived. Jax made excellent cocktail recommendations and Frances was charming, and well versed with the entire menu. Every single thing we ordered exceeded our expectations. The customer service was top notch, thank you Jax and Frances for the wonderful evening. Can't wait to bring more friends in."}
{"text":"Okra, the newest addition to the Crudo family, is quite the little establishment.  I tried the hush puppies, dates and pork belly. By far, my favorite dish was the hush puppies. So creative and fresh! Who would have thought to pair goat cheese and a cucumber salad with this fried delight?! Perfect!  I will say that I do like Crudo better than Okra, however that will not stop me from coming back and bringing lots of friends!  Great service too...friendly and jovial bartenders!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but there was so much wrong.  Our party of four was  first timers. One couple arrived early for happy hour and sat at the bar. We were greeted nicely by the manager and seated, our server was also pleasant. The menu is quite small and all of us felt everything was overpriced. We still ordered 3 entrees and the only salad on the menu, which was a simple salad for 9.00. I liked my rib dish, but it wasn't  worth 25.00. Other diners were not wowed by the fried chicken or catfish either. I was shocked when I received the bill and it was 13.00 for 1 glass of wine.  That being said, that Chardonnay was fantastic.  At that price I would never order a 2 nd glass. For 2 people with 1 entree, 1 salad, and 1 glass of wine it was 48.00., without tip. Another issue was it was freezing in the dining area, and every time the door opened we got another blast of cold breeze. I don't get why they label this restaurant Italian.  My rib had alfredo sauce on it, but that's all we got out of that. They also advertise fish fry where there was none,and were also told there prices went up, so the menu was incorrect. It's a cute restaurant though with patio seating and heaters."}
{"text":"Okra is my favorite restaurant in town. Always have excellent service and I think they run the best bar program in Phoenix. Southern food with some modern twists everything I've had is delicious. I especially enjoy the chicken skins, fried Mac and cheese balls and the soul burger that is only offered on Wednesdays is a pure delight. Great place to bring out of towners or friends."}
{"text":"Items Selected: PTO - Pineapple Plantation Rum, Sherry, Lime, Brown Sugar 'Nduja Dates Fried Chicken Skins & Honey Hot Sauce Hush Puppies, Goat Cheese, Cucumber Salad Buttermilk Biscuit Country Ham, Pimento Cheese Aioli, Hoe Cakes Diavola Focaccia - Calabrese, Mozzarell, Dessert Honey Umbrian Style Fried Chicken with Cornbread Buttermilk Meatballs & Polenta Lemon Chess Pie from The Pie Snob Canned Biscuit Doughnut with Salted Caramel  A resident of Phoenix when Crudo opened its doors to almost universal fanfare from local writers and \"foodies\" alike I have to admit I was not initially a fan of Cullen Campbell's minimalistic cooking or stripped-down space, but told that Okra sees the Chef returning to his Southern roots while continuing to dish Italian intrigue got the best of me, the food almost across-the-board successful while the setting trends hip without 'trying too hard.'  Again occupying a backdoor lot, the patio a lovely place to dine during happy hour as the sun slowly sets, it was just moments after four that I entered Okra's main door and greeted by a hostess with my choice of tables the al fresco option proved pertinent mainly due to the decibel level within, bands like The Black Keys piped overhead alongside others more rooted in Blues.  Reportedly a place that starts hopping after seven, the cocktails no doubt a focus with classics and seasonal specialties crafted by one of the best barmen in town, it was at the advice of a waiter who seemed somewhat green that the newly launched PTO was selected, the smallish pour a bit steep at $12 even for someone hailing from Las Vegas though the fruit-forward complexity was no doubt well conceived.  Undoubtedly more knowledgeable than both my server and the average client about the majority of ingredients on the menu, Happy Hour prices slicing $2-$8 dollars off of several options and thus allowing for ten different plates plus the beverage at a total cost of just $84 before tax and tip, it was with a two-by-two progression that the tasting took place, a pyramid of dates stuffed with spicy Calabrian sausage absolutely heavenly while the fried chicken skins were as rich as would be expected, spicy desert honey keeping umami in check.  Taking a break from the spice to enjoy fluffy hushpuppies beneath a light salad smeared with goat cheese alongside a buttermilk biscuit that was unfortunately so dry that even with added honey it was unpleasant to eat, improvement was quickly found in a lightly charred flatbread piled with thick-cut  Calabrese and its table-mate hoe cakes with rich ham from Benton's and housemade pimento cheese thinned to luxuriously smooth spread.  All small plates to this point, the smoker to my left emitting the appetizing wafts of pork and wood, it was with two larger plates served simultaneously that savories came to a close and although the golden chicken served with fragrant garlic and thyme was no doubt high quality next to toasty toothsome cornbread it was the veal and pork meatballs melded with buttermilk breadcrumbs that immediately captured my attention, the creamy polenta base equally perfect with housemade tomato sauce.  Greeted by the manager and seeing great teamwork from a staff that looks out for one another with regard to bussing plates and filling drinks there was no doubt dessert would follow a meal of such high grade, but limited to a lone housemade biscuit-dough doughnut topped in salty caramel it was in an outsourced option from The Pie Snob that true greatness was discovered, a lemony Chess Pie atop an all-butter crust on par with anything found in the Carolinas or Tennessee beneath a thick dollop of cream."}
{"text":"Me and my small crew had a couple beers and a mixed drink at happy hour early on a Friday night, then tried the hush puppies w cucumber salad and goat cheese, the pork rinds and the mac & cheese balls w marinara sauce.  For me, the standout were the pork rinds. They taste like pork rinds from a snack bag as if you bought them at a Piggly Wiggly BUT there is some kind of magnificent spice blend on these jokers that sets them off. I asked the waiter, I asked the kitchen, but they won't tell me what they put on those damn delicious pork rinds. They are keeping it a secret, the same way Food Network used to quickly pan away from Rachael Ray's big ol booty back when she did that 30 Minute Meals show to keep that booty a secret.   Hush puppies were pretty good, filled with herbs and spices and corn meal, and I didn't mind pairing them with the goat cheese (which was a first for me, because butter). I am not a mac & cheese fan so I didn't partake but errybody at the table was making an \"mmmmm damn good yum\" face, plus they cleaned that plate so I'm thinking they're pretty good.   Happy hour 4-6 weekdays. Drinks and smalls plates for a couple bucks (North Coast Scrimshaw $3 + Old Fashioneds are $5) and don't forget to get you a canned biscuit donut to end your visit. A great new addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable, the atmosphere is nice.  We had three shared plates/appetizers and they were all good.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! I have been to this restaurant many times, but this is my first visit with their new menu. I like that they stuck to a southern inspiration, but I do miss some items on their old menu. Particularly the broccolini and fried egg with almond pesto...it was sooooo good. I really hope it makes a comeback! As far as this menu, I really liked the fried dilly beans and hoe cakes for an appetizer. My husband and I went with some friends and 3 out of 4 of us ordered fried chicken. I ordered the TN Hot fried chicken and my husband ordered the Smothered version. We both really liked his version the best because the gravy had such great savory flavor. To top everything off, we enjoyed our favorite  drink called So Fresh So Clean...it's pretty amazing. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Service was average.  Ambience 4 star. Food over priced and just plain bland. Seems to be a happy hour bar, but Happy hour ends a 6. From my experience,  way over rated."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. The food was excellent. I had the pimento cheese burger. Delicious. The fires green tomatoes were excellent as well. Unfortunately the service was horrendous.   It was a Friday night at 6pm however there were 3 other tables. So not busy. It took forever to just get menus. After that water took forever. Everything was slow. I can admit slow is ok if you are super busy but honestly 3 other tables?? My beer took forever (13 minutes) after ordering. To get the check was another problem. My mom was charged for the wrong thing. So taht took longer to take care of.   I do believe they were understaffed (1 waiter, 1 bartender) and it did get busier as the night went on. Unfortunately I most likely won't be back. I hate to see good food with no service. We left at 8:35pm."}
{"text":"I had the Grilled broccolini with almond pesto and egg- I was decent.   Stacked salad with corn bread, pecan and Caesar vinaigrette (artichoke base)- I was so disappointed. It was a salad that I can simply do myself. It didn't look appealing to me what's so ever.   The server was very nice. Did whatever he can to make me happy and accommodate my vegetarian self. Haha ahhhh.   I love the decor. We sat outside patio, nice lighting and It was so nice out."}
{"text":"Unimpressed might be an overstatement.  I am giving this restaurant 2 stars due only  to the cordiality of the staff.  Normally I would visit a restaurant at least three times prior to writing a negative review; after all, every restaurant has a bad day on occasion; however in the case of Okra I simply couldn't bring myself to spend more money on bad food.  I fail to see the charm in fried chicken skins - greasy, burned on the outside with creepy uncooked chicken skin on the inside.    On my first visit I tried the fried chicken; very average.  On my second  visit, the pimento burger came out absolutely cold inside - I am a \"rare\" beef person, but this was ridiculous.  No third visit.    Miss this place."}
{"text":"Great location and great ambiance in the place.   However, we won't be going back. The food is too overpriced for what you get. I had the fried chicken and was initially amazed to see a giant pile of chicken only to discover that it was probably two ounces of meat and a HUGE pile of breading. I grew up in the south and have lived there my entire life and never had such a terrible breading to meat ratio. I suspect that breading is cheap and chicken is expensive but, come one! Honestly, my kids get more actual chicken meat in the kids meal at Boston Market!  Also, they charge for hush puppies???? In the south, hush puppies are served free, like bread.   Also, they don't accept reservations so we called ahead a couple of times to time our arrival when the wait was small. The hostess insisted they didn't take reservations but several tables had \"Reserved\" signs on them. When I asked the hostess, she told me that those were for \"special guests\". So, I guess that special guests can get reservations but I'm not sure what categorizes as special.  Finally, although I didn't sit in them, there should be a special place in hell for owners whose bar stools are cheap, metal seats without backs. Clearly the focus is far more on vibe than anything else."}
{"text":"I was super excited that the people from Crudo were opening a new place and couldn't wait to try it out. The space was a little hard to find as it is in the back of a building that faces 7th (awe parked out front where there were some businesses still being built, but there is a huge lot in back). The restaurant is decorated nicely and has a 'cool' modern feel.  I went with a friend for happy hour and we went a little crazy with ordering. They have so many drinks on special, it was easy to find something that sounded delicious. I tried the okra cup and the cobbler... both were incredibly tasty and strong! I definitely felt them afterwards. We shared some food - the marinara focaccia, wings, Calabrian pork bites, and the biscuit donut. The pork bites came out first and were just ridiculously delish... little pieces of pork belly with a bit of a tang and a hint of spiciness... the portion was small, but the flavor was huge. The huge pile of wings were also wonderful.... they are smoked, which was a bit weird at first, but as we ate them we liked them more and more. The wings came with a 'white' bbq sauce.... I don't know what this was, but it was like crack.... so tasty. In fact, the white sauce and the hot sauce on the table really saved the focaccia, which was nothing special ( but tasted good when you added the sauces). The donut was tasty, but didn't taste much like biscuit... still good though. I will definitely be back, I want to try the Tennessee hot chicken... yum.   PS happy hour prices are a steal, we had 6 drinks and all of that food for about 50$"}
{"text":"The only downside to Okra is that they're not open for lunch. Seriously, this is such a great addition to an already rockin restaurant area on 7th street. Couldn't have had a better dining experience.   I made reservations through Yelp for dinner here during the week - super easy process that went off without a hitch BTW - and we were happy to see that they were ready for us to be seated right away upon arrival. My 2 out of town coworkers had no issues finding the place, despite the restaurant being in the back, but I missed the turn and ended up circling around. Plenty of parking out back though and such a wonderful rustic hip vibe inside. Loved it from the moment I walked in.   Our waiter was amazing - seemed genuinely excited about his job and getting to share this awesome food with us. I ordered a Okra Cup and an Old Fashioned - both under 10 bucks each for HH. The Chicken Skins and Dilly Beans were also on HH and amazing. I'm in love with picked anything and those Dilly Beans were the perfect bite to compliment a very rich fried skin and hot honey plate.   For our meals, my coworkers went for the Fried Chicken and Mash Potatoes and I did the Short Rib dish. I can't imagine a more melt-in-your-mouth bite than the Short Ribs. So good. Judging by the clean plates across the table from me, the chicken definitely hit the spot as well. Next time, I'll have to try the Pie, from Pie Snob but we went dessertless and just finished up our drinks to close out an awesome meal. Can't wait to go back, its everything you want in upscale Southern food. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Wife and I tried this place out during restaurant week.  Loved it.  Good food and great service.  We will definitely be back.  We had the fried chicken skin, mussels, and Mac and cheese ball with an egg on top = everything was great.  I even tried a few whiskey drinks that were solid.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food with an awesome atmosphere.  It was our first time here and we wanted to see what all the hype was about. We started our meal with the smoked wings. Yep, they are just as good as they sound. Cooked very well, great portion and the sauce on them is killer. No need to dress them up anymore.  For our meals, I ordered the buttermilk meatballs and grits. I'll be honest, the main star of this dish were the grits and marinara sauce. The meatballs were fine, nothing I hadn't had before. The grits on the other hand, were savory and delicious. The marinara on the meatballs also went well with the dish and seemed very fresh.  The wife ordered the fried chicken and that didn't disappoint. It was very good and worth ordering. The corn bread that came with her dish is some of the best corn bread I have ever had.   We didn't have enough room for dessert but next time we come in, we'll definitely get the canned biscuit doughnut."}
{"text":"Let the cocktails start the adventure...and Micah will not disappoint - biggest challenge is which combo he has created to try. Definitely be adventuresome. Not a giant wine list but plenty of variety to match your needs. The appetizers and small share plates require 2-3 for a couple. The okra (grilled with some cheese) is fabulous as are the mac-N-cheese balls (fried) and you MUST get the fried chicken SKINS.. yes I wrote it correctly. Crunchy delights.The main fried chicken is great, as is my favorite catfish dish, but many prefer the pimento cheese burger - a rare delight as well. And if you like coconut pie - you will end with a smile."}
{"text":"Omg this place was better than my wildest dreams!! I finally got to try bone marrow and damn was it good!! Our server was great, she was knowledgeable and able to make great suggestions, we even had a slight snafu with the food and it was handled beautifully by both the server and the manager (who we didn't ask for but did come over anyway, which is great customer service). I also had the hush puppies which come served over Crows Dairy goat cheese with a tomato  cucumber salad on top. My favorite savory item was the fried chicken skins just a bit sweet and hot, totally amazing, I could eat them all day!! The canned biscuit donut is simply divine! I love it! Was really tempted to order another since I ate it first, before my dinner."}
{"text":"So, waitstaff, nice :) Wine list, no. Didn't like it. Ask to taste, not an option. Unfortunately, I REALLY didn't care for the $13 glass of Chardonnay...oh well. The food? I'm from the south, chicken was good. Menu wasn't what I had previously read so what I wanted to order didn't exist. Nice people, didn't care for the rest."}
{"text":"I never knew soul food could be classy, but this place made it happen! The Umbrian Chicken and Smothered Chicken were excellent. The cornbread was fantastic. The service was ok."}
{"text":"We tried Okra last week for a family member's birthday and it was very tasty. My husband and I split the cheese balls, each ordered the umbrian fried chicken, and then shared a donut for dessert. The cheese balls were very tasty, you can't go wrong with fried mac and cheese! We both enjoyed the chicken but it was a tad spicy for me (I'm not a fan of spicy). It was good but nothing overly exciting. The cornbread was very tasty and mashed potatoes were just okay. The donut was very good but the salted caramel made it a bit too salty, we said next time we'd just order the donut plain. The prices were fine but portions are on the smaller side. Definitely a good place to try something new but not something we would visit on a weekly basis.    We went with a huge group and the people we went with raved about the chicken skins and pot pies. They also had some tasty looking drinks! We had great service as well!   I was happy to see the large parking lot behind it as parking in the area can be tricky! We went on a weeknight so there was plenty but it might get more crazy on weekends."}
{"text":"I cannot get this place out of my mind. I have been hankering for excellent southern-style dishes and ... eureka! I have found it. No reservations accepted here and the place is small my friends. But no worries - their bar menu is styled appropriately with throw-back cocktails and southern influenced delights. You will be happy with any choice from their bar menu, rest assured. For appies we went straight for the fried dilly beans and didn't look back. After that we had the hush puppies. Both items were tenderly (not overly) fried and flavorful. For entrees we headed to the Tennessee hot fried chicken (not too spicy); the pork cheek pot pie (novel and YUM) and the two-wash hen and dumplings. Now my favorite thing on the table was the hen dinner and hubby loved the pot pie. Go ahead and check it out for yourself. But, don't skip dessert. Our homemade pie was a dream - something different every night I believe. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"So far so good . I'm really liking the atmosphere, nice the crowd, very hip and laid back. the menu is outstanding and the drink menu is outstanding as well. They  have a slew of  House cocktails and a decent wine-list.this is my all time favorite place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place has the makings of a 5-star favorite.  Happy Hour is Everyday 4-6pm Weedays, but you get an extra Hour on Sat/Sun when the hours are 3-6pm... All of their Southern Cocktails are on HH.  Most of the small plates are, Beers and wines... and I think the prices are pretty decent too.   I stopped in on a Saturday around 5:30 after reading Taric's review.  And yes, this place is everything the folks are saying about it and more.  I already know that I'm going back.  I want to try a few more things on the menu.  So far,  I've had the chicken skins..  Honestly absolutely delightfully tasty... The crispy skin and the sweet and spicy drizzled honey sauce pairs well with their Okra Hot sauce.  (just be careful pouring the sauce out of that bottle... it has a wide mouth and you'll have a plate full of sauce)  I also ordered the Tennessee style fried chicken.  A leg and a thigh.  I was not quite a impressed with this as I was the chicken skins.  The chicken wasn't seasoned well enough and to me, Tennessee hot style chicken (like Gus') is not wet, its actually dry.  Nevertheless, the chicken was still very tasty and I would have it again, but request the sauce on the side.  No time soon, there are things on that menu that I must try...Here's a todo list: Chicken Skins: 5/5 Tennessee Fried Chicken: 3/5 Beef brasato: 5/5  Pork Belly Bites and Greens Pimento Cheese Burger Hamhock and blackeyed peas Bonemarro biscuits and stuff potlickker mussels Oysters al forno...."}
