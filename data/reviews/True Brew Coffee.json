{"text":"Really enjoyed the roast on the latte with a European nutty smooth finish. Tucked away in a plaza corner so not obvious unless looking for the place."}
{"text":"This is a nice little (small) coffee shop that serves good coffee and food at good prices.  The two owners (also cooks and servers) offer friendly and solicitous service (asking what type and amount of sweetener I would like as my latte was prepared).  I originally stopped in for coffee and a pastry, but after having my latte and a tastily-spiced pumpkin muffin, I had some time to kill, so I proceeded to a nice egg-salad sandwich (with your choice of ingredients: e.g., cheeses, meats, vegetable fixings, and condiments) and an iced-mocha.  Be sure to save your cup from your first drink to get your second drink half off! The friendly lady who served me is a little quirky, singing along to the music that is always in the background (an eclectic mix of Adult Contemporary, Jazz, and Swing music on the day I was there), however this quirkiness just adds to the offbeat charm of the place.  I stopped in while I was in the area two days later and needing another caffeine fix, and though I didn't have much time to spend there, I was again charmed by the friendly service on offer. As I'm in the area several times a week, I think I've found my new favorite coffee spot."}
{"text":"If you're feeling blue, you won't after a visit to True Brew.  Always a friendly atmosphere with great coffees, lattes, a lot of loose leaf teas to choose from too.  Be sure to check out the always changing art for sale adorning the walls.  It's nice finding a great coffee in this part of town - Bell & 16th st."}
{"text":"They did it again!  Every time I go there, the same thing. Great espresso! I love the fact that the truely delicius flavors of the Portofino Blend espresso from  a local family owned roaster really satisfy. The equiment is always clean and well maintained.  (Gotta love a  great service crew). The staff are Always friendly and casual. If you're looking for a coffe bar that keeps it simple and always delivers beyond what you'd expect, they'd  love to see you."}
{"text":"This is a great shop!  The owners are great and put their heart in to what they do. Your money is well spent here.  My only criticism is that i think there are better local roasters than Passport, and it would only make the product better if they used one of several excellent local roasters located in the Phoenix area.  Don't get me wrong, Passport is good.  For those of you that frequent Dutch Bros. down the street, True Brew is worth getting out of the car for."}
{"text":"Love it!  Had hot chocolate,  coffee,  and breakfast there multiple times.  Really good."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and decent sandwiches but once again HORRIBLE iced coffee. Can anyone do it right besides Dunkin Donuts? Im trying to so hard to find another good iced coffee store but no one can compare to D&D yet."}
{"text":"It's only the best coffee joint ever! I got a large black coffee, which was very tasty! I also enjoyed the people who work there, they were so welcoming and actually seemed interested in how my day was unfolding. So, needless to say, this is my new favorite place on earth."}
{"text":"amazing place!! coffee, tea, food and service are all 5 star! I love it for breakfast and lunch :-)"}
{"text":"Great, friendly place to sit and enjoy your brew. Also good breakfast sandwiches. Love finding independently owned stores."}
{"text":"I was looking for a coffee shop in my community, and found this location nearby.   The coffee is splendid!  (My iced breve mocha was too notch, and I had a chocolate muffin with cream cheese - it was delicious)  The staff is courteous and attentive.  I'm glad I found this gem so close to home."}
{"text":"Liars. Say they are open until 3. Walked up to the entrance at 234 pm. Saw the light on and it said it was open then when I try to open the door it was locked. And they shut their lights off. What kind of business is this. Ridiculous do not come here"}
{"text":"I asked Siri to take me to Tru Bru and she took me to this place instead. I live in orangecommma California. The drive was 5 hours and 10 minutes and I was late to my thing. I didn't even get any coffee because I spent all my money on gas.   Would not coffee again 0/10"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short & add more later. Awesome little shop! Perfect for a read and some brew."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, can't remember the gentleman's name that was working but he was friendly. I only got a jalapeño cheese bagel but it was delicious ! Cute spot"}
{"text":"Been looking for a small coffee shop! I'm all about the little small shops. Glad I found this little gem. The customer service is top notch, and they sell some handmade items in the shop as well. I found my puppy a cute little collar. You also can't beat the price I got my 24 oz chai half a sandwich and half salad for only 12.00$ .. STEAL!"}
{"text":"I'm still up in the air about this place. I've been here about three times in the last couple of months.  I was looking for a good coffee place because I no longer go to Starbucks and although I loved Dunkin' Donuts last couple times I was at their place the store it was filthy.  So I decided to practice what I preach and go locally owned.   The first time I went I got a some sort of mocha flavored coffee which was the most awful tasting thing I can't even describe it. However I decided to give it a second chance and I'm sort of glad I did because both times I got their ice coffee which was really good.  Some people have posted about their great menu but I looked all over the store didn't see any menus Iexcept what was behind the counter which just described coffee.  I know they have food because I could smell it unfortunately it always smells like garlic in there. Anyway because the ice coffee was good and it's a locally owned small business I'll keep going there"}
{"text":"Nice cozy coffee shop! good coffee and nice pastries, free wi-fi! I got a nice big Cinnamon roll and it was nice to see they put a few rasberries on the plate! it was a nice touch and good customer service!  Would like some power outlets though! But nice spot to waste the day away for a bit and soak up some wifi!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Iced Tea I have EVER had! I am going back to try the food next time!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and fell in love with the place.  They obviously have a great coffee menu but also a surprisingly large loose tea selection as well.    Lunch was fantastic.  You can choose from different ingredients to build your own sandwich or salad.  I had a tuna sandwich with sprouts and avocado that was to die for, and the Asian coleslaw was really yummy.  Everything is fresh and prepared with care. Can't wait to try breakfast there with my hubby some morning.    Loved the overall feel of the place. The barista and the owner who I had the opportunity to meet were both incredibly friendly.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I had only the briefest of visits, and I had me an iced mocha, so I can't really opine on much that a coffee snob would approve of. The iced mocha was good, and the lemon poppy muffin I picked up was everything a lemon poppy muffin should be. The ladies working inside were very nice, and happily identified every flavor of the incredible-looking muffins available.  Note: This place is tucked into a corner between a church (which I suspect it's affiliated with - sneaky christian coffeeshops!) and a tile store. It took me a moment to believe I was in the right spot.  Another note: I really love the non-drink/food products they sell inside: lovely jewelry and super cute pet collars by local creators."}
{"text":"Great place! Great people! Great food! Thanks to True brew so glad you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"True brew is an adorable and VERY small coffee house in north Phoenix. One of the only independent coffee shops we have up here. The espresso and filter coffee is yummy and cheap. The owns are absolutely lovely and tend to recognize regulars. It's a little hidden but absolutely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"This is a super cute lil coffee shop, and the people inside were extremely nice and very chatty. I have only been here once but I would definitely go again...although I have to say the drink I got really wasn't that great. I'm thinking maybe I'll order an extra shot of espresso next time and try my luck! I'll definitely update if/when I do!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love that they deliver to my work. Pet Food Depot employees are hooked on the chocolate milk. The owners are fantastic people! It's a cute shop but only have been inside a few times. Having it delivered to me is much more convenient."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service and my Americano is made with perfection.  Love the handmade quality silk scarfs Plus the walls are adorned with by the same artist Creations By Meenakshi"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday morning. Staff is great, they know their stuff. This place is great. Indoor and outdoor seating. Lots of local artists represented.  Iced Chai was good and iced coffee was okay. I am glad they open early because they close around 4."}
{"text":"Well the tea was okay? But how do you go to a coffee shop and have ZERO outlets and only two small tables? And then the sarcastic lady laughed at me when I said I was just hoping they had a bigger table. She literally said \"well you didn't bring an extension cord?\" Hahaha no. I didn't. I figured as a coffee shop, you would have electricity and maybe some wifi covered. Tea wasn't even that spectacular. I'm not sure why everyone gives good reviews. Terrible experience as a college student. Hours are also awful."}
{"text":"I just had my first experience at True Brew coffee. The coffee shop is super quaint. The lady behind the counter was supper friendly despite being very busy. She was very knowledgeable and helped me make a good choice for my taste. The drink was amazing! I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Such a great local coffee shop!  I love to support small businesses.  My iced French vanilla latte was perfect!  I ordered a breakfast sandwich (which they freshly prepare) and it was delicious! Super friendly people too! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Not best location but that's not their fault . They had a very local coffee environment but the coffee was very good . I also really enjoy how they support local businesses."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful place! If want a simple breakfast and great service...True Brew is it."}
{"text":"I bet their coffee is amazing, when they get your order right. The woman who ran his coffee shop looked like they were working hard, and it felt like it's always bumping wigs lot of regulars. It also feels like they have strong relationships with their regular customers.   Thus, they did get my order wrong, and a regular after me got her order before they started working on mine. BUT it is super cute and like a art gallery, and the women in their were awesome.   I'll probably try it one more time."}
{"text":"Super sweet owners. Love that they are local and started with a cart downtown. Coffees great, haven't tried the sweet stuff yet but plan to soon. Cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome little place with some awesome cold brew!!!  Rochelle was super nice.  Great place to stop by!!"}
{"text":"I recently tried their breakfast burrito and it was the best burrito I've ever had! I am also a big fan of their customer service and I definitely make it a point to come here every time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic service,  food, americano, music and atmosphere! I'll definitely be back here!!"}
{"text":"I've worked a couple miles from this place for years, and I just discovered it on yelp today. I'm sad that I didn't hear about it sooner! The staff was friendly, and the latte was way better than what I've been putting up with at Starbucks down the road. I highly recommend giving this place a try if you live or work nearby... What a great little hole-in-the-wall coffee place!"}
{"text":"When all I need is a great cup of coffee  True Brew is a great local coffee shop. They have great specials and breakfast items. I just tried their Iced Americano and muffin  for the first time and both were amazing.   The staff is very friendly and helpful. Meet your friends here and enjoy some of the best local coffee. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is a great local little coffee shop located in a strip mall with some sort of a Zumba place next to it. It was thumping from the music of class next door when I got my coffee. Combined with the coffee shop music the two music's together were a little bit overwhelming for me first thing in the morning.   I'm glad I found a mom and pop type place close to my work. The large mocha was delicious and strong. I think it was $5. I honestly was sleepy and didn't remember.  I was humming around all day from it!  I love all the local art for sale. They had some pottery and jewelry for sale from local artists as well.  They have a really good iced coffee too. I wish they would get a coconut milk substitute but most places don't unfortunately.   Still I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The coffee is delicious and the owners are fabulous. They are very community minded. I am happy to support this local small business."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but they serve it in cardboard cups. I'm a firm believer in sitting and actually enjoying a coffee, served in the proper vessel, which is a nice porcelain cup. It retains the heat and allows you to really enjoy the foam in a cappuccino. Get some real cups and you'll be a 5 star coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the coffee was made quickly and taste very good. I would highly recommend this place for anyone trying to support local coffee shops."}
{"text":"They have some very good tasting coffee and the service is fast and friendly. Along with a good reasonable price I have to say I like this place a bit better than Starbucks."}
{"text":"I had a great time visiting this coffee spot! I was looking to kill some time and stopped in for a breakfast snack and some chai.  The breakfast sandwich I ordered was DELICIOUS.   While I sat on the porch and read, I could hear the conversations between the baristas and the (seemingly) regulars and I was happy to be in the presence of such positivity."}
{"text":"We love supporting locally owned businesses and True Brew doesn't  disappoint. Love the strong coffee, made to order breakfast burritos and artwork from local artists shown and for sale!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place with delicious muffins and a solid selection of tea. The staff was very nice. I would come here again."}
{"text":"True Brew is a good as good can be! This cafe is owned by the great harmonica and vocalists Rochelle Raya formerly of Sistah Blue. They serve great hot & cold coffee drinks, sandwiches, soups, salads and pastries.   They serve it all up with the best sunshine smiles in the valley! True great food! Great brews! Incredible music with the best of local artists like Rochelle and Nancy Delessandra now of the DelRayz, Linda Bilque and many other greats! Truly local independent Arizona - I have found a new place to hang!"}
{"text":"Being that this was my first visit I wasn't sure what to expect. When it comes to my cold brew I am picky, and the flavor of the cold brew was strong and to the point! Mixed with almond milk made my brew taste amazing! They do have pastries available and offer breakfast and lunch . Overall loved the drink and will be back very soon !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Coffee is fabulous, although I am one for teas which they have a very large selection of. Definitely found my new place!"}
{"text":"Local owned small business run by two of the nicest ladies. I love places where you know they treat you like a guest in their own home. The coffee, pastries and food is of the highest quality and it's all made with love. What more could you ask for. If you're in the area stop by for some good coffee, good music and a good atmosphere.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had an Americano not too long ago from here. Friendly service and surprisingly good coffee. It reminded me of life before Starbucks, when we were loyal to our neighborhood coffee shop. I'd definitely come back again.  The only things that needed improvement were the sad, stale looking pastries in the display case. While in line, I was considering a croissant or something, but they really scared me away."}
{"text":"Even though I had been in California for the last two years, the ladies at True Brew remembered me when I popped in for a caffeine fix last weekend (perhaps this is a sign that I may have been here a wee bit too often). Even better, my drink card was still on file (wish they would have told me that they knew I would be back). My espresso was every bit as delightful as I remember, and the owners just as personable. I am going to keep introducing my friends to this lovely shop so that it will always be available to me. Selfish, I know!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix on a weekend trip 11/02/12 (filling in as drummer for the Joann Powers Band), my friend and I stumbled into True Blue and what a great experience was had.  Rochelle and Sharla were finishing their shifts and made us feel like long time friends.  Great coffee and wifi and they even let me turn my coffee into iced coffee before I left.  I did not realize that Rochelle was a musician.  I wanted to email her and tell her and Sharla how much I dug their place so I decided to do it here.  You guys ROCK! jimmy hunter www.jimmyhunter.com"}
{"text":"The sandwiches and coffee selection is wonderful. I've enjoyed the friendly staff and food for a year. I strongly suggest you give them a try."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town ! Customer service is always great. You can't beat a huge coffee and awesome breakfast sandwich for $10."}
{"text":"I love this little place. I bring my grandkids here occasionally. They are always very friendly and accommodating. They talk to the kids and take their orders. They always treat them with respect. Awesome coffee! Awesome food! Awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I found my new fav coffee place in town. It's always the little hole int he wall corner shops that get me. The gal's who run the shop are so personal and inviting. I am coming back here for sure.  they made me the BEST iced Americano with white mocha  i've ever had.. and it's 32oz... how awesome is that?!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a cup or two and I am so glad that I did. Great staff right here. All were a friendly bunch and quite helpful. The coffee they made was truly tasty and quality was great. Will definitely stop by here again if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim. Can't recommend the place highly enough!!   V good cup of coffee and v fresh, made to order sandwich."}
{"text":"Reminded me a lot of Coffee Rush in Gilbert/Chandler... Up to 32oz for iced coffee and decent prices. Fast service with plenty of treats (we got a chocolate chip cookie which has a surprise cinnemon and... banana? flavour). A bit hard to find as it's tucked in the corner of a small shopping centre but just look for The Codfather on the northeast corner when driving."}
{"text":"I have read about this place on Yelp and had a hard time locating it so i will tell you where it is. It is on the Northeast corner of 16th St. and Bell Road in the north west corner of the shopping area.  Ok back to the review, it was all I read about the girls were super helpful and giving lots of sugestions on what to get.  I got a very large iced grapfruit green tea, good choice it is very good and the price it right. I will be back to have some coffee and the breakfast, lunch menu looked good too, so if you like a mom and pop kind of place this is it, I am all about supporting them instead of the big businesses.."}
{"text":"I will keep this simple... Great personal service and quality coffee.  A hidden gem of North Phoenix.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well danged if this isn't an excellent find. Honey on hand to add to my 6 shot Americano and it's perfect. Some nice food and gift items alao. Absolutely to return."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! The staff is kind and inviting. My first time in and Jerome made me feel like an old friend. Had my toddler with me, and enjoyed my coffee on their patio. The coffee is delicious and they have plenty of syrups to customize your order. The inside of their shop is decorated with art from local artists available for sale, and other items like jewelry and candles."}
{"text":"I like this hidden little coffee shop in the corner of a North Phoenix strip mall.   Friendly employees. Lattes have been pretty good, though I'm admittedly no coffee expert.   I can appreciate the art for sale on their walls. Support local!   Last time I was here, the weather was perfect. We sat outside on the patio with our coffees and had a lovely view of Lookout Mountain.   Nice spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"Nice place, nice people, good coffee. I would have never found this place if it weren't for yelp. I have driven past it a million times, and even been in the parking lot of it multiple times for the vet office and never saw it.   It's a cute artsy store. Smooth music playing and photography and art covers the walls. They have a menu that clearly shows their sizes and prices so it's easy to order. The Barista gave me tons of options and asked questions to make sure that it was made the way I like it, even though it was just an Americano.   I would definitely go back, it's just not on my way to work anymore but if I'm ever nearby needing a fix of caffeine then I will gladly stop in."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop decorated with local art and items for sale.   Almond, soy and coconut options. I got a hot caramel mocha, iced caramel macchiato (not on the menu) and a cheese danish. Everything was really good. Vegan options available.  You can get 20% off your first purchase if you check in. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"True Brew! This place makes me so happy and was a huge stepping stone for me to get away from crappy Starbucks coffee. I discovered it through a friend of mine that was moving to California and was instantly hooked. Their drinks are reasonably priced, incredibly delicious, and the staff is wonderful. Whenever I order a flavored drink I'm asked how it tastes before I leave, just in case I have a sweet-tooth and would want more flavoring to it...   Anyway, I can't express how amazing this place is enough. Just walk in, order some coffee, and see for yourself. Oh, and for local artists - the artwork is regularly changed, so if you want any of your work displayed all you have to do is ask. Honestly, what's better that a great coffee shop with some excellent eye-candy on the wall? ;)"}
{"text":"I sure hope this place gets some good business because I could hardly find it....sometimes it's better that way anyways because this place was great. Got the iced coffee and I must say it was some mighty good coffee. $3.50 for a 32oz beats out Starbucks or Dutch big time. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"A VERY nice establishment, very nice people working here.  The coffee was fresh, but not to die for.  Would I avoid this place? No way.  Would I go out of my way to come back (like I would for Seattle Espresso)? No."}
{"text":"True Brew is still my absolute favorite coffee place in Phoenix. Rochelle and Sharla  make every single customer feel like a friend. They know us by name and remember our favorite drinks. Delicious breakfast sandwiches with fantastic artwork on the wall. I can't think of a better way to spend my Saturday mornings (ok maybe sleeping but that's another topic). They also have live music on certain nights when weather permits, on their outdoor patio.  They also have a super cute children play group that meets there on Saturday mornings. Such a great place to have in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Local music & artists supported here! Browse one of a kind jewelry to multi-media artwork while sipping Guatemalan fresh brew & munching on a muffin. Mocha Java was delish! Tucked away in a quiet corner behind 5-Spot bar. Love supporting local, small business owners. You rock!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into True Brew half asleep on a morning they were closed.   They just happened to be brewing coffee for the church located in the same strip mall that day.   She obviously recognized our state of caffeine deprivation, and even though she was closed she welcomed us with amazing conversation, and even better cup of coffee, a creamy latte, and a morning treat.     In conversation, we learned that she provides healthy lunches for my daughter's high school, supports local artists, and genuinely understands the community and it's need for great local coffee, tea, and healthy meals.     I was so taken back by her generosity, that I will happily return at a time they are ACTUALLY open.    Thank you Rochelle!  5 stars!    Jenn and Matt"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Very attentive service and everything we ordered came out very quickly. I had already eaten so I just got the frozen latte on special and a turnover, but if you ask for the breakfast menu like my fiancé did you get an amazing breakfast burrito! Really tasty and inexpensively priced. Stop in!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! I was looking for a good coffee shop around my house, since all there is is Starbucks everywhere and I am SO happy I found this!! The coffee was so delicious and the food was amazing!! Super fresh and delicious homemade salads and sandwiches.  The owners were so nice and they completely support local which is great"}
{"text":"This place is no yolk, seriously there are no yolks in the egg sandwiches, whites baked to deliciousness. The rest of the ingredients are pretty standard stuff, but the overall effect is a delicious breakfast served with a side of absolute friendliness and charm. The coffee is strong and properly prepared. Where else has the server had the cinnamon in hand for my cappuccino before I could ask? Not a big place but a great stop for an early breakfast"}
{"text":"This place blows Starbucks out of the water!  Please check it out and support a local business keeping the $ here in the community and hiring your neighbors as employees. Oh, did I mention the coffee and breakfast burritos are great!!??"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place!! I've been coming here for 3 months.  Its a small walk from my apartment.  I love the people that work here, they are so friendly and they always say hi to my son who is with me.  They really have excellent customer service and I love the frozen latte. Because of true brew Starbucks has become my backup place for coffee!! Love you guys!!"}
{"text":"The reasons I love this place:  They make your ice tea fresh when you order it.  They sweeten it for you and everything.  I'm a tea fan, so that's a big thing for me. Super friendly staff. Everything made from scratch. Coffee and tea locally roasted/blended.   Big menu for such a little place, and reasonably priced, too.  It's just nice--really nice.  It's the kind of place you can go, sit and read a book from cover to cover.  I did that today, in fact.  I haven't had coffee there, but I tried my boyfriend's and it was excellent.  I haven't had much of their food--only soup, but it was awesome.  And the people have been so friendly every time I've been there.  I've been in once when the owners have been in, two smiley ladies who are really proud of their business.  I only wish they had longer hours."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop!  Loved all the art.  Enjoyed my make to order sandwich.  Tucked away from the street, but worth a try."}
{"text":"They have things that make them stand out as a coffee shop, but they strongly lack the things I need for it to be a return type place.  1. The only reason you will catch me in a coffee shop is because I need to use my laptop. So it needs free wifi and accessible wall outlets with comfortable seating. I'm not sure if they had the wifi, but it was definitely a no-go on the wall outlets and seating. There was one table and bar like seating, but that's about it. It's one of those very \"hole in the wall\" types, so make sure this would be your grab-and-go kind of stop.  2. I dont drink all that fancy coffee. I drink black coffee, thats it. No cream, no sugar... just, coffee. The coffee I got here was burnt and it was self serve, I dont know how fresh that is. Pretty disappointing.   3. I do like that they offer a vibe that reminds me of San Diego a bit, and that they support local art and bands which is pretty epic. Reminds me of the place that I used to live across the street from.   I do want to return just to try their food, their sandwiches seem reasonably priced, and I'll update my review if and when it happens. I was soooo looking forward to liking this place, it just didnt happen."}
{"text":"Very laid back, friendly place.  I stumbled upon it this morning and decided to get a coffee and a breakfast burrito.  Coffee and food was good and they have free wifi I used to work on my laptop for a few hours.  The only bummer is there's no power plugs if you need power for your devices."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place  for coffee or a healthy breakfast or lunch. Breakfast burritos are delicious. Everything is made to order and fresh. They have lots of local artists display their wares and they support the local schools. It is all good and a friendly place"}
{"text":"Such a great little hidden gem coffee shop. The coffee is amazing, the employees are very warm and welcoming, and they also have a cute little shopping area featuring local artists and businesses with candles, jewelry, CD's etc. I love all the support for local businesses. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area! :)"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of Hidden Gem. The staff was so genuinely friendly, i almost thought i wasn't actually awake yet. They have a wide variety of loose leaf teas and an assortment of coffees. They also serve breakfast and lunch! I had a delicious croissant + egg sandwich and it was better than any high end restaurant sandwich I've ever had. (No joke). Highly recommend!!!"}
