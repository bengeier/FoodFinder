{"text":"I've read so many good things about Drupati's Doubles and was so looking forward to them.  Got some last night and they were soggy, the chickpeas were not soft and the taste was off.  I was VERY disappointed.  The chicken roti was OK - not great but OK"}
{"text":"I work close to this place and being a fan of roti I gave it multiple tries to order food from here.  First time I gathered the troops and got my whole team to order food from here out of ten orders only 6 were ready an hour later out of the 6 they only bagged 5 but charged me for 6. Had to go back again to get a refund for my colleague.  Recently tried to give it another shot however not to my surprise they had messed up the orders again the news came after waiting ten minutes even though we had ordered ahead.  Customer service sucks, they mess up your order or don't prepare it at all,  even if you order ahead you have to wait.  Complete waste of time every interaction I've had with this place and it's employees."}
{"text":"A friend and I shared a chicken roti and stew chicken with rice and peas for lunch. We both had upset stomach( I must have farted like 50 times after the meal) and progressed on to diarrhea over the course of 24 hours.   FYI I've had Drupatis roti and doubles before without any issues.  If you've had the same experience after eating at this place on Friday Sept 16, 2016, you are not alone. Something is horribly wrong with Drupati. If I can rate it ZERO star, I definitely would!"}
{"text":"Best doubles & paratha! Careful though, the Scarborough location is the best IMO."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food seemed to be warmed in the microwave.  The tables could have been cleaner and the staff friendlier."}
{"text":"Everything about Drupati's makes me happy - what it lacks in fancy furnishings, it definitely makes up for with lively calypso music, cheerful staff and lots of happy patrons!  My boyfriend and I ordered 2 doubles (just as good as the ones in Trinidad! and a great deal at $1.50 each) and a mini goat roti shortly before closing on a Saturday evening. Service was quick and the food was hot and delicious. The staff were extremely helpful while we debated their complicated menu that is packed with various specials, different-sized curries, regular rotis, mini rotis, parathas, dhalpouri, rotis with and without rice, callaloo, fried bake ..... so many options, so little time!  I returned later on a Sunday afternoon for take-out and judging by the crowd, Drupati's is extremely popular! This time, we tried the regular chicken roti, mini shrimp roti and a plain paratha - everything was great. Despite the crowd, my wait time was perfectly acceptable. Their pricing is reasonable ($8-9) for a regular rice/roti dish though I feel their curry servings are on the slightly smaller side.  I would definitely return in the near future, particularly for the doubles and shrimp roti. I also want to try the bake and shark and some of the fun Trinidadian juices when I come back next - they seem to be popular items judging from other orders I overheard. I look forward to eating here again extremely soon!"}
{"text":"Drupati's doubles are simply THE BEST!  Amazing spicing.  Sweet tamarind, delicate patty, thick stew!  Mmmmm..."}
{"text":"I think I just found my new favourite roti shop! Stumbled across this place while shopping for swim supplies around the corner at Omni Swim.  Had a delicious chicken roti with pumpkin and spinach, and a side of doubles (chickpeas in a sweet/spicy sauce sandwiched between two fluffy flat fritter things) that my husband declared to be the best he ever had. Regular size roti was HUGE- like, the size of my head!- thought I was going to pass out trying to finish my meal but managed to pack it all in and washed it down with a bottle of coconut water. Mmmm. Hope to make it back here sometime soon to try something else from the menu, although it's a little out of the way for us downtowners. This place proves it's true what the foodies say- some of the best food in the world is hidden in the strip malls of Scarborough!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place millions of times and have always been meaning to check it out, but never got a chance to. Then a few weeks ago, I had some friends over and one had brought some of their phulories.   The phulories came with their delicious tamarind dipping sauce, which you may end up drinking. Because it has such a nice flavour, you may want to order an extra the next time you have them and trust, for its price (8 for $2), you wouldn't mind going back often which I had done in the past week (I've gone twice already). Definitely worth the multiple treks. 5/5.  Decided to order their stew chicken special since I was too lazy to cook and I was a little disappointed. Though the weight and size of the special seemed generous, they were most generous with their rice. The chicken itself was nicely cooked and was very tender. The stew was a alright. I personally didn't like the taste of the macaroni pie, which seemed to have a more of a bitter taste to it. Perhaps it was their choice of cheese? Who knows. The salad it came with, which was very little, was very mediocre. I didn't even bother eating it. 3/5.  I definitely plan on going back to try other entr√©es, however, I'll probably choose another before choosing their stew chicken again. The phulories I'd go back for, at any given time. Or at least when I know I'll burn it off or that I know I have a full prescription bottle of my cholesterol meds.  ** Update **  Came back here yesterday and ended up trying their doubles, which turns out to be THE TRUTH! The baras were not greasy at all and had a nice density to them.  The channa was very hearty and delicious, even without the pepper sauce.  If you need something to tide yourself over, this is actually perfect plus it's only $2.  They do have some gourmet ones where you can add chicken, shrimp or goat I think it was, for less than $5.  Definitely something I'll be trying the next time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try to like this place, I really did. It's so close to my house.  But I couldn't.  The roti is lackluster, and extremely, extremely dry. I'm not expecting super moist chicken, but come on .... Give me something you know? I can't recall if the flavour was good or not, but I would assume it was since it didn't really leave a bad memory in my mind.  The doubles are even meh to me. I might try this place again in the future, but for now, I got my go to roti/doubles place someplace else."}
{"text":"Ended up trying this place after debating with myself about Roti Hut for a long while. Got two doubles and a boneless goat roti so share between my +1 and myself. The double are absolutely delicious. Sweet, spicy, soft and sloppy - an absolute flavour explosion from first to last bite. At $2 a pop, definitely worth getting.   The roti was quite large and well sauced (I prefer my roti on the saucier side to avoid getting dry mouth) as well with good flavour. Not spicy per se but lots of curry flavour. I found that some pieces of the goat were a little on the lean/chewy side, but some others were melt in your mouth. It really depends on the particular piece of goat that you bite into. Personally, I would have preferred a little more consistency between pieces of meat, but overall it's pretty tasty. I probably wouldn't get the boneless goat roti again - not saying that it wasn't good, but I'd like to try some of the other selections on the menu instead."}
{"text":"What a great Caribbean brunch spot!  My uncle took the family out for weekend brunch, and all of our favorites were at the buffet! Saltfish, tomato choka, goat Curry, pumpkin, okra, eggplant, Sada roti, bakes and hot sauce! We ate to our hearts content, all the food was hot and fresh!  Unfortunately, it wasn't  five-star coffee. However the coffee was hot, fresh and was refilled the instant it ran out. The restaurant itself was a little cold, which may have been due to the temperature outside. We were sitting next to a window.  For the buffet, you need to pay up front and then serve yourself. Cleanup is also self serve, which is easy since all of the plates and utensils are disposable. This is no fancy brunch place, but the food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place when my girlfriend brought their doubles to a party. We had the jerk chicken combo and boneless goat roti. I really like their rotis here. I can reheat it the next day and it still tastes good. I just wish the meals were slightly warmer. And ask for extra gravy for errthing!"}
{"text":"Look....lots of Caribbean food places in Toronto...but very few as authentic and great tasting as this place. Great value and great food"}
{"text":"I've only tried the doubles here, and I heard this was the best doubles place but I don't see what the fuss is about. Puri could have been crispier and the chick peas were good but nothing special. I love doubles so it's a great double, but not my favourite.   They were really busy but the take out service was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"Excellent roti! The shrimp and duck curries are my favourites.   Where this place really shines is the doubles- I honestly don't think you can get better in Scarborough. I've even brought family from Trinidad to try their doubles, and they agree that although it's not the real thing- it's probably as close as it gets over here.  I would suggest calling ahead to place your order if you're picking up. It can get pretty busy around lunch/dinner, and on the weekends."}
{"text":"Mehh... nothing fancy just very basic. I heard a lot about this place and was excited to eat there. Very disappointed in my opinion the food lack taste . Doubles was ok curry ok roti not bad . Probably wouldn't eat here again unless I was starving ."}
{"text":"Average at best - the flavour is there, but they insist on making the driest rotis.  There is zero gravy inside.  It's like eating meat with sand.  I will stop going here."}
{"text":"Just. Amazing. I came here for a double on the way to the bank and immediately returned after to get more food. The doubles are delicious. Spicy and sweet and ... drool.  I got the shrimp roti after reading on here that it's a favorite... I will be following everyone who suggested the shrimp roti now because holy. That. Was. Amazing. The pepper sauce that accompanies the roti is so spicy but the flavour is phenomenal. The mini filled me.  There are an assortment of sodas and goodies. Tamarind balls. Plantain chips.  Lots of seating and was fairly busy on a Saturday. Lots of soca on the radio.  Great spot... will be back... soon."}
{"text":"The doubles melt in your mouth. If your brave enough you should get it with the pepper sauce. I'm not sure what it is, but i am sure it may have what trinidadians call bandana sauce, or perhaps 'chadon beni'..it's a green pepper sauce but your lips will go on fire. Maybe some scotch bonnet peppers in there as well. There is a sweet mango or tamarind sauce that counters and mellows it. I recommend without a doubt to go and get there doubles with pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Best West Indian buffet breakfast. I tried to taste a little of the large variety of delicious food but only managed a few selection. Bake, chicken curry, goat curry, mango curry, chutney, roti, saltfish, tomato puree and a couple more. Quality and taste 5 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and now it's my go-to for bomb doubles. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"This is you average roti shop but a bit more spacious. Very bright, large flat screen TVs, loud music playing, and a weekend buffet (Sat.-Sun. 9am-2pm). This place is definitely nothing fancy nor is the service anything to brag about and the food, well it's just average    My mom is Trinidadian so I know good Caribbean food when I taste it and this definitely wasn't great. I got the shrimp roti and my man got the boneless chicken roti. Honestly, I got like three pieces of shrimp in my roti, no lies! My man hardly got any chicken in his roti and he got the regular size so you'd expect more meat but that wasn't the case. I feel like it's usually a bit more tasty but today's curry was pretty bland if I'm being honest and it tasted like there was hardly any pepper sauce.   Anyways, I know the buffet is usually pretty decent so I'd come back for that in the future but other than that, I probably won't be back to eat curry from here again. My mom can definitely cook up a better curry than Drupati's."}
{"text":"As usual it hit the spot. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I had to wait 20 minutes.  Looking for a good Roti then look no further."}
{"text":"Omg this place suck i came to this place a  Couple of time sometimes i call to order doubles when i get there i still have to wait For half hour the service is really bad the doubles is to messy no taste their roti at the end of the roti u can see it still raw i don't  know why their take so long to give you your order the toilet is next to the kitchen their customer service need to improve their curry is to watery when their now started their service was good now its sucks their doubles has no chutney and it's to messy to eat this is not normal when I order double it's just has pepper something u can eat it because it's to hot and just plain I keep wasting my money"}
{"text":"Delicious doubles! I Pick them up on my way home from work on occasion.  A bit too greasy at times, but very flavourful."}
{"text":"This is delicious food. The customer service at the Yonge location with the young men normally at the counter left a bit to be desired  (and I think that's why it may not have done well). Nonetheless the food is so good that you keep wanting to come back to get it so they are doing something right. I'm going to check out the main location now."}
{"text":"My go to place. Food is delicious. I especially like the daily special . Mon- thurs. they have mini roti. I can't handle the regular size. I like the king fish with curry.it's a pass. Only disappoint twice.I have been there over 50 times."}
{"text":"Homie recommended the Doubles and he was totally on point. They were amazing! Really tasty spices and the texture was perfect. They were super hot (don't know what happened to that other reviewer - must've just been an off day).   Definitely a necessary and awesome snack food experience. Roti was also good but not the best in the city by a long shot.   Go for the doubles and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious roti and doubles - and great service! Great place for a cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered the Shrimp and Dahl Roti. There was way too much Roti and not enough filling. The filling was quite bland.   We did get there around lunch time so it was busy so it did take a while to receive the food. I wish I could say that it was worth the way...but in my humble opinion, it wasn't.   Maybe their not known for their Roti so I would be open to trying something else.   As a side note, the cashier was not very attentive or friendly. A smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"My friend, Raj N., has been raving about the food at this place for a while so I invited a couple of other friends to join us for their weekend brunch buffet.  It was fairly busy when we arrived around 12:30pm on Sunday. They had a steady line of takeout customers and most of the tables were occupied by diners. The large windows at the front let in a lot of natural light. There was nothing fancy about this place though. Everything was very basic.  The buffet tables were set up against the north wall and everything was covered. Handwritten signs described the contents. There were several variations of roti, two kinds of chicken, curry goat, and lots of vegetarian options to choose from.  The stew chicken was just okay. The curry chicken was flavourful and the curry goat was my favourite, although it was in dire need of replenishment both times I went to help myself. It was mostly bones left. Too bad. The chick peas with potato was also very good. The saltfish, not bad. I would have liked to have seen some rice or noodles on the menu, and maybe a salad. Another meat?  Overall, the food tasted good but the ambiance was lacking. Dinnerware and serviceware were all disposables. No table service. Like I said, nothing fancy about this place. Not a bad deal for 12.99, all you can eat. Oh, we had to pay in advance before eating and also grab a table - kinda like a food court."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there this evening. We just moved into the area and have heard great things about drupati s food. My bf got the curry goat bone in with rice and I got the boneless chicken roti which came to $19. The roti was totally worth the $8.99 however the curry goat was dismal. There were literally 3 pieces of meat and the rest was bone and fat with a ton of rice and salad. Unfortunately I only checked the food when I got home and did not want to go back to complain. Very disappointing because he was really looking forward to it. The flavor of the curry was good but where's the meat??? For 9.99 it was a rip off so I don't recommend it. Should you choose to get it make sure to check your order before you leave.  The place seems clean and like a regular west indian joint. I would go again but will always remember to check what I get before I leave."}
{"text":"This is one of three locations of this Trinidadian restaurant.  We had had Caribbean food before but never specifically Trinidadian, which I am told is pretty much similar to Guyanese.  In any case, if you don't mind an informal atmosphere and counter service, this place is great!  The curried goat (we splurged and ordered the boneless at $8.99) was wonderfully tender and came not only with rotis but with doubles, a kind of think taco filled and a chickpea and sauce mixture.  Delicious and our server gave us extras to make up for a slight mistake in the order.  Another member of our party had the curried chicken which was also wonderful.  Rotis were nice and soft and hot, and you can have them either on the side or as a wrap for your food.  They also sell packaged Caribbean food items ad even CD's.  The goat meat was flavourful and butter tender.  Atmosphere is worn, but who cares with such great food at bargain prices.  The lady who took our order was very friendly and helpful.  They have a lot of unusual soft drinks from the islands, too."}
{"text":"These people messed up my order THREE times! Kept omitting items I paid for and then tried to blame me for it. After the unnecessary hassle, they then told me that I could get a full refund. Come to find out, they went and told Just Eat (I ordered from Just Eat) that they would only refund the one item they kept messing up. Very shady and dishonest. So much for the stress, my wasted time (between them and JustEat, I was on the phone for an hour about this issue) and their lies! Let's see if I actually get that partial refund."}
{"text":"So far I've tried the doubles and shark and bake sandwich. The shark and bake sandwich is very large and very filling. Lots of baked shark meat wrapped by a bun. Its no ground breaking meal but its worth a try. The doubles however are a must have. I have tried other doubles from other Caribbean places but no other place can match Drupati's. I'm not sure what kind of spices or sauce they put in it but it has so many different flavors (Sweet, spicy, curry flavors). Most I've had were 3 doubles in one go and I'm sure I could eat more but that would just be plain unhealthy. Best doubles in town."}
{"text":"I tried the doubles here for the first time. Not the greatest double I've had. But satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and the employees were really nice and seemed happy. The food was good. I had the jerk chicken and rice and peas. It could have been spicier but I'm sure if I asked they could have probably done it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on 05/28/2015 as it is close to my work, and I was craving some roti. Looked up a bunch of places and settled on this one, so decided to go on my lunch. It's a bit of an unassuming location, but the sign is easy to spot (which is great).  Walked in, the place was kept well, the tables were clean and I was starting to get excited. So I looked at the menu and the staff was quick to help me out with my questions. I decided on the Lamb Roti, which comes in a small or regular size. I decided on the regular size, but oh man should it be called large.  I pick up my order, head back to the office to eat and when I open it, it's this monstrous square roti that smells delicious. The lamb was excellent, the curry and spices were great and the filling to roti ratio was golden. Lamb was cooked well, and really hit the spot.  Will definitely be back to try the doubles and other foods.  Cheers!  Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Location: 4/5"}
{"text":"My mom's from Trinidad, so I guess that makes me half Trini and therefore at least 50% qualified to talk about the food here. But really, you don't need to be a foodie or from the Caribbean to know that the food at Drupati's is just plain delicious. And affordable too!  Reading the menu, it's like a list of all my childhood comfort foods: callaloo, bake, pholouries, stew chicken, goat roti... the list goes on and on. I think the only thing missing is macaroni pie, but I doubt you'll notice the omission as you work your way through the extensive menu. Everything I've ever tried is well-prepared, authentic, and delicious. Love the doubles, which are a steal at $1.50 a piece; two or three could easily make a meal. And you can't go wrong with the rotis and curry--I'm partial to goat, and even the cheaper \"on the bone\" variety is still impressively tender and easily slides off the bone. When I'm feeling fancy, I've done their shrimp roti, too, and it's also really good.  Drupati's isn't fancy, but it feels cozy and lively, with reggae beats keeping things upbeat and the joint is always jumping. This is straightforward comfort food, so there's no need for stuffy pretension. Plus, the prices are pretty much unbeatable, especially if you come Mon-Thurs for their lunch specials; my favorite is Toonie Tuesday when you can get a mini bone-in goat or chicken roti for just $2.99. For the price, it's impossible to beat AND I don't have to feel bad about weekly visits because they're so kind on my wallet (if not my waistline).   Scarborough has no shortage of great ethnic eats, but Drupati's is definitely one of the best. If you're craving the taste of the islands but can't afford the plane ticket, barring my grandmother's kitchen, this is about as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"They make the best doubles.   Service is friendly but bit slow and takes some time to get your food. So be prepared. But I think its worth the wait for the doubles."}
{"text":"I went there on a Thursday after work with a friend. I had been 1-2 x before, a couple of years back. There was plenty of simple seating and TV with CP24 in the background.   But most people seemed to be there for takeout. I suggest ordering ahead of time as it took 15-18 mins  for us to get our small order of: reg boneless chicken roti ($9-10), 3 doubles ($1.50 ea.), 1 reg potato and channa roti ($6). Total =$22 (inc. taxes)   The regular size rotis were quite large - we requested they be cut in half. Portion size is good. The boneless chicken was dry and only 2-3 pcs of meat in each half. The doubles were deelish and spicy (on request)!   We each had half a roti and 1 double and felt full. So we had leftovers for lunch the next day. Note: we were both female so perhaps someone else could eat the entire roti.   I had the potato & Chana roti next day and it was fine but nothing special. More roti then filling and was not spicy as I had requested. But for $6 + tax it was good value.   I like that they have mini sized rotis...I'll get that next time and it's a few dollars cheaper."}
{"text":"My usual roti place in Scarborough is Roti Hut, but three customers suggested I try this place out.  I ordered a bonus chicken roti with a double and Kola Champagne.  I still love my Roti Hut but this place may be a bit better.  The key to a great roti is the curry, which this one had.  What I loved about this play was the moist chicken...usually well cooked and the freshness of the roti.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pros:  - Good value - Food tasted alright for the most part - Staff and friendly and a nice vibe to the restaurant  Cons: - Wait times could be improved  Ordered: Doubles - Pretty good doubles for the most part. I liked mine with pepper Stew Chicken - This was okay. Nothing killer but it wasn't bad. I got a side of macaroni which was a little different than what I'm used too  Conclusions: Overall, Duprati's is average. The doubles are good and stuffed to the brim with the filling. The mains I got there were okay. Nothing outstanding or unique but nothing bad either."}
{"text":"Best Doubles ever! and cheap 1.50 Im vegetarian and their veggie platter is amazing and well flavored rice and peas!"}
{"text":"A very upbeat place with good chunes playin all day.  Very open space with lots of seating.   Came for some aloo pies. Took a while to get em but they tasted good. About the size of your hand, $2.50 each. Reasonably priced.  Includes channa and chutney.  You can tell them if you want it spicy or not.."}
{"text":"I have been to Drupatis a few times to grab doubles or palouri. Usually the place is pretty busy and you have to wait some time. Depends on when you go though, but I usually go on weekends if I do.   The atmosphere is nice, feels like a shop from the Caribbean. Sit down and relax, watch football (soccer) on TV or something. Has the yellow bright colour you would expect from a shop from home.  The good is decent quality. Palouri can be a bit dry at times, but the pepper makes it better. Doubles is good.  A-OK I recommend, and I will update the review when I try other things. Usually I get the larger meals from my mom at home :P"}
{"text":"Drupati's is a local favourite and it's been a long while since I had some roti. I was in the area so I decided to pop in, hoping to quell my yearnings.  Short of being a hole in the wall, the Scarborough location can definitely use some renovating. The interior is outdated, hopefully their roti's won't be...  I ordered a boneless goat roti, a boneless chicken roti, and a jerk chicken plate.  The roti. Traditional lined with sweet potato and chick peas, it's pretty tough to go wrong. 3 stars.  Boneless Chicken. This was a bit dry despite the channa that accompanied it. It was chicken breast, so it was tender, but probably a bit overdone. 2,5 stars.  Boneless Goat. The same channa as the Chicken roti, this too was a bit on the dry side. Again tender, but probably overdone. 2,5 stars.  Channa. This is a curry based sauce with chickpeas. I'm not sure if they're catering to the area, but it lacked in flavour big time. The ratio of chickpeas to sauce was also a bit heavy on the pea side. Indian (and Trinidad-Indian) foods are all about the sauce. Sadly this one not only missed the mark, it missed the target, and the wall the target was mounted on. 1 star.  Jerk Chicken. Finally something with a bit of heat and a little true to it's flavours. I truly wasn't hear for Jerk, but thought I'd give it a try anways. The plate was accompanied with the traditional rice and peas. There was a good ratio of peas to rice, but was nothing spectacular. 2,5 stars. The Jerk Chicken fared a little better than expected, but it doesn't rival the late night fare in Oakwood. 3 stars.  Overall, I was a disappointed in Drupati's. But despite my opinion, it's a local's favourite, so it must be my taste's that in the minority. But still, I have to call it like it is (for me). 2 stars.  ====================  On a side note, if you want to try it for yourself, I suggest you go and try their weekend buffet. That's right, they have one! For $10.99 (tax and tip not included), you can try a variety of their fare, a great deal considering a rote costs between $8-$10. See my pics for what's included in their buffet."}
{"text":"I heard about Drupatis from multiple sources and was excited to go but they were a severe let down.   The only reason they even get any stars was because the doubles were good.   However, they took nearly an hour to bring one serving of jerk chicken and it wasn't worth the wait at all. Lucky Lins has better jerk chicken and are quicker service.   And to top it all off I got charged TWICE for this meal and ended up paying $27 for two doubles and some sub par jerk chicken.   Not worth the hype. Go to Monas or somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back over and over again!    Their doubles are phenomenal!  The spinach is also a great choice!  Lots more to try so excited!"}
{"text":"roti and goat curry as well as shrimp roti. both tasty but advice to the cook - easy on the salt shaker. hence the 3 star."}
{"text":"My doctor is right next to Drupati's so I have been here quite a lot in the past 3 weeks. The roti are tasty but the standout is the doubles. They are a must. It's nice to find a caribbean place that caters to Trini flavours as they have all the Trini drinks and snacks - channa, currents roll, LLB, and the like. Only took off a star because sometimes the food takes a little long. Otherwise this place is perfect, almost like being in Trinidad."}
