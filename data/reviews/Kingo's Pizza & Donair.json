{"text":"I have ordered the donair pizza for delivery and that way better than expected everything was cooked just right even with all the toppings the pizza wasn't soggy it was awesome.  I will make a point of going to the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"We have lived in Acadia for almost 3 years, and just found this jem! We loved the food, it was delicious, authentic and made with the best ingredients. I got a fully loaded Chicken wrap with garlic sauce and sweet sauce and my husband got the fully loaded Donair wrap with tahini sauce. We were both very impressed, and will definitely be back! The staff was very personable and welcoming, a rare treat it seems these days. Even though we were there right at the lunch rush (lots of school kids crowding in) we still received excellent service, and we even given a complimentary dessert, Very good, and we look forward to going back many more times."}
{"text":"We were in the area and Kingo's came up highly rated so we had to try it out! Love donairs and these donairs were unbelievably amazing!! Great flavour, great service, will definitely be going back to try their Donair pizza! Definitely my favourite Donair spot in the city so far and I've tried a lot of donairs in Calgary!"}
{"text":"The food is great, would be better minus the hair!!  Had a donair right when they opened, delicious, however, I pulled a coarse, long black wavy hair out.  I was fighting to keep what I had already eaten down and swore I would never give them my business again.  However, by no choice of my own, my colleagues have purchased the donair pizza a couple of times with the luck of no hairs. With my turn to buy lunch for the office, I thought, what the heck lets giver a shot.  Into my second piece of pizza, a HAIR!  I called Kingo to politely suggest wearing hair-nets. Great food, just be cautious of hair."}
{"text":"I really like this place, right next to a school and offers them sales, the prices are pretty good too, they have good ice cream, good donair, average pizza from what I hear. Amazing selection of sodas and some popular middle Eastern soft drinks too. Fries here are good and there are lots pizza and donair toppings. Definitely reccomend"}
{"text":"I love my donairs and it really is truly hard to find a good spot in calgary. I found mine. Great service, great food, great energy!!! Thanks kingos"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm do I ever love me some Kingos! I live in the area and decided to check out what all the hype was about, and trust me - it definitely measures up! Everything is so fresh, and to me that's one of the biggest make or break components with these types of places. I'm almost embarrassed how many times I went in the past month to get those chicken pockets or my new found favorite, the cheese pocket with sriracha sauce (EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY IT!) .. Family owned, and has that home cooked hearty meal feel to every plate. Best thing is they don't jip out on ingredients like some other places - you for sure get what you pay for.  Thanks alot Yelp.. Now I'm craving Kingos again.."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated business that always keeps you smiling when you walk in.  I had the chicken shawarma and my friend ordered a donair the other day and everything was on point. The meat was moist, the outer pita was crispy, the sauce (garlic sauce) compliments the shawarma, and the hummus has a nice consistence.   I drive all the way from the Shawnessy area to eat here because I have yet to find a good to donair/shawarma spot nearby. Needless to say, this is where I'll be taking my business for some great Mediterranean food all the time :)"}
{"text":"I tried Kingos for the first time last week, and it was a great experience, I went with my son on a hot evening, we were in the mood for Pizza and had seen Kingos on Facebook through Friends Posts. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had, the owner suggested we try the donair pizza. I did not know what to expect, once we tried it, my son looked at me and said wow, it's so different than anything we had tried before, we loved the dough, and the pizza sauce was a donair garlic, and sweet sauce. It was covered with donair meat, and garnished Mediterranean style. This place is fairly new, and full of flavors and must be tried by everyone, the other specialities they have on the menu look great, we shall return soon to try, we also after the pizza tried their home made sweets, a mixture of different Lebanese sweets and baklava, home made! Nothing like home made, enjoy this new treasure!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, always prompt! Their Donair meat is perfectly spiced; the only donair I've found in the city that doesn't require hot sauce. Lots of meat and their sauces are divine."}
{"text":"I'm Lebanese so I know a good shawarma. Their's was quite good. Saj bread was light and tasty."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the quality, convenience, value and taste of the chicken platter. The staff who helped me were nice and good.   The salad is topped with crispy bits of fried pita bread. Nice touch but if they stay in the platter for too long they get soggy so there's no point.   They top it off with slivered almonds. No added flavour or crunch. Unsatisfying and no big deal. When she asked if I wanted them I thought it would be a nice touch but I don't want baklava flavours in my savoury chicken platter.    The garlic sauce is so garlicky that you will have bad breath for the next 24 to 48 hours. Not worth it.  Hummus is good.   Salad is iceberg lettuce and a few chopped tomatoes. The pickled cabbage is awesome. Sparse. Also you get three or four slices of pickled hot peppers which added great flavour.   The rice is good but it comprises about 70% of this dish. Should have more meat or potatoes (no potatoes) but the meat wasn't very good so I was fine with it.   The meat: I ordered chicken, no depth of flavor. Bland. Could've been cooked much more. I could see the fat and cartilage so that was offputting. Pieces were either cut very big or tiny.   Value: I paid $14 for this platter. I wish I could have my $14 back.  It was Saturday at noon. I would've ordered pizza slices, advertised for $3.50 each (only cheese or pepperoni) but they didn't have any ready.  This place looks like it hasn't hit its groove yet. It's not busy. I feel like they don't take it seriously. For heaping good plate of shawarma definitely I'll be going somewhere else. Sucks. I wanted to like this place so much because it's close by me.  I came to this place because of the outstanding glowing yelp reviews previous to mine. Now let me make this review useful. If it's Donair or shawarma you're after: go to Shawarma Palace on 17th Ave., Northeast it's a 10-15 minute drive from this place. Fast, fresh, busy, line up that moves fast, super value and mouthwatering."}
