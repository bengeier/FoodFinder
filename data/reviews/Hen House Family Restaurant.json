{"text":"Love this place. My family and I have been going to this place since I was a little kid.  Always great and friendly service.  We are not from the area, but when we go to visit relatives in Southern Illinois, we always stop here.  My sister and I always get the breakfast - great pancakes and biscuits and gravy.  My Dad loves their fried chicken.  My niece loves the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  Great small restaurant, reminds me of a Mom & Pop - hole in the wall kinda place!"}
{"text":"Nice place. The food is delicious. I think their pancakes are the best in Illinois. I also tried their fried potatoes. They are super tasty. I will be coming again to this place."}
{"text":"If your expecting cloth napkins and waitstaff in tuxedos then you're just stupid. This down home, deep fried and comfort food. Waitstaff is very down to earth and friendly. My 3 1/2 year old grandson loves the chicken strips, apple butter on crackers, home fries and peg game on the table. I've had burgers and breakfast items. I have not had anything I didn't like. As far as the decor, early American farm stuff. Kids love to ask what the things are on the wall. I like the place!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: We ended up eating at The Apple Dumplin in Urbana, which was great Cons: Just a horrible, horrible experience My Advice: Stay away, stay far, far away  I'm 32 years old and in my adult life I had never walked out of a restaurant refusing to pay for the food. Then I visited the Hen House. It was just terrible.   A quick recap:  I ordered Chicken Fried Steak. When the meal was brought out to me, I just sort of sat there and stared at it, probably with a stupid surprised look on my face. It looked like a hamburger, so I cut it open aaaaaaand it still looked like a hamburger. When the waitress returned, I asked her what it was and she told me it was chopped steak. I'm not real sure what chopped steak is. That being said, steak my ass, it was a damn hamburger. Even if it was Prime Rib, though, it wasn't what I ordered. Strike one!  My fiance ordered Fried Chicken. When she attempted to take a bite out of it, she got nothing. After telling me that it was too hard to bite anything off, I had to try it for myself. She wasn't joking! I had to stop biting down for fear that I would break off my partially repaired front tooth. I swear, you could have used that chicken as a hammer. Strike two!  My step-daughter-to-be ordered a childrens pizza meal. This was just your average personal deep dish pizza that you buy frozen at Wal-Mart. That's all fine and well, good enough to keep a 4-year old happy. Believe it or not, they actually managed to screw that up too, though. When it was brought out the first time, it was still frozen in the middle. The second time it came out, it was still cold. The third time, I think it was actually warm, but by that time we'd had enough. Strike three, out the door we go!!  Disclaimer: My son ordered pancakes and bacon. It actually appeared to be satisfactory. Sorry, though, 25% is not good enough."}
{"text":"The service was very quick and coffee cup never went empty. The dinner came with three sides. Liver and onions were amazing. My husband had breakfast and said pancakes were the best. Very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"This is not some fancy upscale place but we often go there for breakfast and it is very good.  The place does a lot of business as we sometimes have to wait for a seat.  (hey we all can't be wrong)  The wait staff is experienced and excellent.   Plenty of food for the money.  There are not many choices in Mahomet but even if there were this is a good place to go eat."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here. It's not the best but you can't expect much from an older diner place. I usually continue to visit because it is a classic sit in diner and I just like the feel of it. Seating can be uncomfortable if you're there for a long bit of time since it's wooden benches, booths, and chairs. They have a little gift shop so to speak but nothing really pops."}
{"text":"Pretty much an old restaurant that has a decent breakfast, but a limited, poor menu the rest of the day.   I got a hand pattied burger which was good quality meat, probably sirloin, but absent of any seasoning.  Bun was cheap and flavorless and served with a big thumbprint on the crown. Tomato and wilted lettuce served on the side, where I left them.    I was hoping the onion rings would be something I could enjoy. They were probably hand battered, but again, no flavor!  The fried batter also kept flaking off or getting stuck  in the ketchup and ranch dipping sauces.   So...big thumbs down on this place. I should have just Went to the Chinese restaurant down the street..."}
{"text":"Waited way too long Sunday morning for a simple breakfast.  We sat down right away and ordered but it took the food almost an hour to come out.  I think they were understaffed.  The food was OK but it's pretty hard to screw up breakfast food."}
{"text":"Now that restaurants are smokefree in Illinois, I've returned to the Hen House. No matter what time of day, I've only eaten their breakfasts, which almost always hit the spot. The waitresses have been there forever, and they are all good servers and very kind. It's not fancy, but I like it."}
{"text":"I agree with the Countess, the chicken is not the best ever, but it is fresh and obviously made to order.  The sides are cafeteria-quality and are certainly not made to order.  The price is right.  The country decor is kind of quaint.  The Hen House seems to cater to locals and it is a good place to catch up on the local goings-on."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is good country cookin and the people are very friendly."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried chicken in the area!  I like their chicken noodle soup when it is available, good chili otherwise.  Chili is homemade and good."}
{"text":"If you're reading a review for the Hen House in Mahomet on Yelp there's a 99.9% chance you're from out of town and a 100% certainty you aren't going to be impressed.  But a $20 bill will get you, the Mrs. and the kiddo a tasty truck stop breakfast and you can get it in your PJs without feeling like a pauper.  This is your local yokel Greasy Spoon where the blue hairs sip coffee at sunrise. Church crowds fill the place every Sunday and in the 30 some odd years I've been eating there I'm sure I've had something other than breakfast.... but I can't remember when.   It's tasty, cheap and trusty. Quiet, old and rustic just the way we like it in our small town"}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast in central Illinois, or even all of Illinois. The Hen House encapsulates the blue collar feel of a big farm breakfast and combines it with the high class service of a steakhouse. The biscuits and gravy? Devine. Bacon? Heavenly. The gift shop located near the entrance? Fully stocked with goodies. If you visit on a Sunday, just make sure you beat the church crowd otherwise you'll be enjoying Cheerios at home instead of a 5 Star meal."}
{"text":"we wanted to try all the restaurants in town when we moved here. My kids loved the look of the place... its a barn! You enter and its def a diner feel. the waitresses were sweet but the food was bleh. I got this pasta and chilli dish that seems to be an IL thing (chillimac?) but the taste was so bland. My children said they loved their meals.. I mean, can you go wrong with kids diner food? I wanted to love it because it wasn't a chain restaurant but it wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Well....we gave it a try!  There are very few restaurant options on the lonely stretch of highway my friend and I were traveling. We passed the Hen House on the way to our destination and I made a mental note: That place looks awesome! We decided to stop on our way home.  It says that they have a gift shop, but I wouldn't really call it that. It was more like an alcove full of empty shelves with a few random truck stop junk items left over from years past. The dining area is extremely small. Luckily there was a booth open so we didn't have to wait. Our service was wonderful!! But wonderful service can't save the food.   My friend had a bit of a problem choking on her chicken strips, she said they were too dry. I thought I was going to have to do the Heimlich. I ordered a chicken salad because of some dietary restrictions. There wasn't really anything else I could order, so I gave it a shot. I definitely could have made better myself at home. Strangely enough they had wonderful cole slaw.   The rest of the menu was pretty much just diner food - lots of fried chicken options, sandwiches, breakfast food. Nothing was really a signature dish....just food you'd find at any other hole in the wall greasy spoon."}
{"text":"We were there early in the dinner time. Service was prompt and courteous. I ordered fish and chips without the chips, my wife had fried eggs and hash browns. She liked hers. My fish was super small fillets with thick greasy crust. It wasn't very good and did I say it was greasy. The coleslaw that came with it was ok, no more. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of the Hen House. Recently, we were breakfast desperate and headed over again. The food was much better than I'd found it in 2011. The whole family agrees. I like the pancakes. They are homemade and the best thing there in the morning. The scrambled eggs are still awful, unless you like them dry roasted on the griddle. The breakfast meats are decent, though, the American fries are delish (deep fried potato cubes), and if you get your egg fixed a different way, you'll be happy. The coffee's pretty good, too, in that basic diner style. All in all, a decent breakfast, though nothing fancy, at a good value."}
{"text":"My chicken fried chicken was perfect. The roll that came with it was so light and fluffy, served with a vat of butter. So good. My parents tried the meatloaf special and the open face turkey dinner. Also really good. Cute restaurant, and fast service even though it was super busy. Win!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this place as I drove through with some friends. I had the fish and chips, and the fish was fairly decent. Also had the breaded mushrooms, those were good. My friend had the chicken, which was fried, and he said it was very dry. The sides were very good - especially the mac and cheese.   Prices were fair, atmosphere was cozy... Music was out of place. There were several old couples and they were playing an 80s station. George Michael's Sex came on... I just remember thinking this is kind of awkward."}
{"text":"This restaurant holds so many memories for me. Most of the time when I come the food is great. I've been eating here my entire life and I will always encourage people to eat here so we never have to worry about it closing."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade cinnamon rolls!! Plenty of frosting and the roll is enough to share."}
{"text":"Haha.. I went here because the restaurant I actually wanted to go to was closed early due to the weather.  I have seen this place and always wanted to try it out.. so I thought, why not?  Inside is more like something you'd find in the south.  Not very modern.. old fashioned.  This restaurant serves fried chicken... breakfast foods.. sandwiches.. and southern comfort food.  The fried chicken was a good deal.  $9 for 1/2 fried chicken and 3 sides.  The fried chicken is not the best I have ever had but it is fresh.  The blueberry pancakes were good too... 3 pancakes for $3.50.  Not real blueberries like at Courier.  Also tried the reuben which was okay.. and the pulled pork sandwich.. which was decent.. but nothing spectacular.  I'd stop in again because I know the prices are reasonable and decent.. but definetely not a must-go place.  But it must be popular.. they have several locations!"}
{"text":"This town favorite offers friendly service and solid American diner choices at reasonable prices. I think that Hen House is a chain or franchise in Illinois, but this restaurant seems to be locally owned. I've enjoyed both breakfast and dinner here. I recommend the fried chicken dinner, one of their best items on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped here on way back home to Florida. Breakfast was fast and tasty. Hubby had cinnamon roll that is as big as your head for $2.95. Our waitress with her blonde curls was as sparkly and sweet as her jewelry. Would highly recommend. Family restaurant with hometown feel."}
{"text":"Good country restaurant,  when first seen the sign from the freeway I thought the name sounded like a strip club lol... it's not"}
