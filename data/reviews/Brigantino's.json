{"text":"While walking up the Danforth deciding where to have a romantic dinner it was the coziness of the Italian wine cellar like interior that caught our eye. Upon being seated we were pleased that the service was fast & that the waitstaff & host were very helpful & enthusiastic about the menu options. We ordered a bottle of rosé to go with our meal which was chilled & very refreshing after our walk in the warm autumn evening. Everything from the appetizers of stuffed arancini to our eggplant Parmesan & pancetta carbonara had that delicious home made taste. Definitely a new Danforth favorite for us."}
{"text":"What a great new neighbourhood find! The pasta is excellent as is the service. So excited to have a new place in the 'hood for Italian food. Very reasonably priced, good house wine options and very kid friendly. The owner, Theo, is an excellent host and we are looking forward to it's long run success in Riverdale!"}
{"text":"The space is cozy and comfy, though the \"Sinatra and mobsters\" decor and music is maybe a bit cliche. The staff was very courteous and friendly.  The gnocchi was a lovely texture, though be warned that the Gorgonzola sauce is still a red sauce, and a bit light on Gorgonzola.  The portion itself was generous, but this was actually the first Italian restaurant I've ever been to where no bread was offered.  And I really would have liked to dip some bread in the remaining sauce! All in all, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this restaurant! It's pricey but so worth it! The house wine is delicious, they pour in generously and it's really a bargain - each glass 6$!  We had the bruschetta, caprese salad and a seafood salad as starters; the seafood was of exceptional quality and even as a non shellfish lover I liked it a lot!  My husband had the veal scaloppini and he loved it, I had the lasagna and it was also very yummy! The tiramisu was a worthy intake of calories ;-) we found our new Italian gem in danforth!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but after eating there last night, this might just be my new favorite restaurant. Amazing food, great wine, fantastic service. Will definitely be back (again and again). Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service!  We had goat cheese pucks, bruschetta, 2 pasta dishes and loved it all! I hope people give it a chance because it is a great restaurant!  Only complaint there was very limited wine selection... That said the wine we did get was great."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Highly recommended for homemade Italian food. Management and staff are A+++"}
{"text":"We had been hearing some good things about this restaurant, and finally got a chance to try it. So glad we did! It resides in the space of another Greek restaurant we used to love. Decor is simple, but comfortable. From the minute we entered, we did love the friendly service, with the manager that night being extra special :) All the staff we watched and encountered tonight were super polite, and attentive, and seemed genuinely glad to be there. We were seated with a view into the kitchen, which I loved, because those guys were hopping, and it showed me how focused they were in preparing our amazing food. The wine list is pretty decent, and there is a corkage fee if you want to bring your own. We ordered a bottle of the Francis Ford Coppola cab, a personal favourite. The bruschetta was great....as was the seafood appetizer platter. I thought my chicken parm with pasta special was very solid, and my husband really liked his homemade fettucine diablo. Great espresso as well, and we particularly LOVED the cups! Very ergonomic and a pleasure to hold. The menu is a good size, and portions are, too. The food here is delicious and hearty, not overly trendy and skimpy. You are, afterall, in Italy on the Danforth! This place is worth your time."}
{"text":"Oh man the best Chicken Parmigiana I've ever had. My fiancé and I both ordered it, we just tried different pastas to go with it. I got meat sauce and she got Alfredo. Mine was really good but hers was even better. We both left the restaurant thinking about our delicious dinner all the way home. Actually I'm still thinking about it right now haha.  Service was also great, server was very pleasant and attentive. We're looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Just ordered through Just-Eat. Veal Scallopine was tender with a flavourful creamy sauce with fresh herbs. Get the vegetables and potatoes; it came with roasted potato, sweet potato, asperagus, brussell sprouts, mushrooms and they were not overcooked. The gnocchi is home-made and perfect. Bonus: we phoned the restaurant to ask if they could make the gnocchi  without hot spices and they were very friendly saying just to leave a comment and they'd make it any way we asked. The sauce was very rich and not too hot. The food came warm rather than hot but it's not hard to heat up in the oven. The containers are aluminum with clear plastic lids. They were in a plastic bag. Other services have drivers with insulated bags but it's certainly not a deal-breaker: better to have great food a less than hot than bad food hot."}
{"text":"I had a rough day today and got to the resto exhausted and hungry. The staff were amazing. I t hunk they might have been closing but A meet saw on my eyes I just needed a delicious meal. They delivered. The chicken park was amazing. Tender, tasty sauce. The girellini was amazing! The pasta  was so fresh and light and exquisitely delicious. Even the salad had a most tasty house made dressing. No salad from a bag. Fresh leafy and delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our first time here and man, was it delicious.  Everything  was great and homemade (right down to the noodles).   We had calamari to start, followed with veal scaloppini with spaghetti carbonara.   The starter bruschetta was a nice touch.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. 5/5 Appetizers were great (bruschetta and calamari,) the bruschetta was amazing! 5/5 The mains were (2 plates of veal with pasta sides) good, a little pricy and quite rich but all in all very good. 4/5 The desert came on the house which was a wonderful touch and tasted unbelievable. I don't even like tiramisu and this knocked my socks off. 5.5/5  Total - 5/5 would 100% come back."}
{"text":"Showed up here for a planned dinner with another couple on a Tuesday night. Despite the fact that we had reservations and they had my contact information the place was closed with no note on the door or anything.  Great way to treat your (now ex) customers!!!"}
{"text":"I love going to smaller, cozier restos where the servers are super attentive, the chiefs are passionate about cooking and takes pride in their work and last but not least, the owners spends time to talk to you.  Put all that together, you get Brigantinos!   This resto has only been opened for 3 months but it seems like they have been in operation for many years. Everything was on point and I'm so glad we found this little gem on the Danforth.   In contrary to previous reviews, I don't think the prices are expensive at all. Their entrees ranges from $18 to $30 with very generous portions and superb quality.  I highly recommend the seafood platter to start. The lightly battered fried calamari was uber crispy, so delightful when paired with the house dipping sauce. As for main, I had the lamp chops with grill vegetables instead of their homemade pasta which I later regret after a bite of my friend's. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and seasoned, it was just simply amazing.     A five star rating is reserved for a very special place and Brigantino's has a very special place in my heart."}
