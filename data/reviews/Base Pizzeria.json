{"text":"Only complaint for this place is I wanted a bigger pizza because it was so good. Service was awesome and great for a family visit will be back soon"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious.  Bruchetta for appetizer Strawberry salad Piggy pizza Chook pizza Nutella pizza French press dessert  Ambiance was nice for our group to chat and catch up.  Waiter attentive, but not hovering.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Completely agree with the other Yelp reviews. I was visiting from out of state so, this was my first visit to Base Pizzeria. Great atmosphere, friendly and fun service and fresh delicious pizza. Had the Beet and Goat cheese salad as well as a Base pizza- both delicious!  Ingredients were so fresh. One of the owners served our table and he was so friendly and funny- just made it a delightful experience. Highly recommend this place and wish them great luck as they grow their business."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start?! First we ordered the Spicy Snag with pepperoni and it was amazing. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The sausage was very good, the pepperoni wasn't your usual pep it was large and  perfectly cooked, and the carmalized onions had great moisture. The crust was soft but a little crunchy. After all of that we had fresh strawberry reduction sauce over organic vanilla ice cream. The sauce made it. It was very refreshing and satisfying. The best part of it was the service. This is a family owned restaurant. The owners are a couple and a brother. They are very kind and generous. They let us try their homemade olive oils-ghost and carolina reaper. Overall this was a great restaurant with great food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch on a Saturday. Great organic food and great service. I had the Pear and Rocket salad (I added organic chicken). It was amazing! Add an ice cold green tea infused with tropical flavors and you have the perfect lunch for the hot Arizona summer. I definitely will be back! We need more restaurants like this in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow!  So I live in Arcadia and Base has been on the brain for a while -- also my girlfriend is a huge foodie so we tend to eat out at tasty places. Anyway we were at the bar in Windsor and happened to be sitting next to a guy who was the pizza chef at Base -- awesome guy and super chill. He was a huge fan of what they were doing at Base and really passionate about the pizza. Totally crazy how everyone in the food & bev industry knows each other but whatever it's life.  Anyway we were at Base last weekend for lunch and both the service and food were IMPECCABLE. My girlfriend is more of a stickler for food while I'm more of a service guy -- IMO if you're not having a good time then you might as well stay home and enjoy your own amazing company you know? Either way both of us left super happy.  Re: the food -- we got two pizzas (the meaty one and the spicy snag), a modified beet salad, finished with a tiramisu dessert, all were amazing. The pizzas tasted completely different as well, the spicy snag was lighter and the meaty one was obviously meaty, both were delicious and all the toppings (and tomato sauce) were FRESH. The tiramisu was absolutely wonderful too, not too sweet and texture was perfect. As an aside, their goat cheese was DELICIOUS, if you're a fan YOU MUST TRY SOME.  Re: the service -- most important for me is that our server Roscoe gets it -- we wanted to take our time so he didn't rush us, but he popped in appropriately from time to time to check in. Also (and this is a big deal for me), he explained the food perfectly and could say where all the ingredients were sourced from -- we're both health conscious and most of the stuff was organic (my girlfriend does crossfit and recognized the specific farms the food comes from). Roscoe's obviously passionate about what they're doing and it shows.  We will be back and I'll most likely become a regular. These guys get it."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhh-mazing pizzas!! Love their rotating dips as well. Everything we've had here has been wonderful!! Owners are super nice! If you appreciate Australia, you'll be happy to see some Coopers beer on the menu.....but they are very gracious and engaging....can't say enough about how great Base and the staff are!! New local hangout!! :)"}
{"text":"We love the owners and the location. We have really enjoyed many of their menu options but would like for them to abandon their \"organic\" theme and focus more on offering great lunch and dinner selections."}
{"text":"I could give a detailed account of our dinner here. But I'll sum it up this way: Australians making pizza? Thanks but no thanks. Too many excellent and AUTHENTIC Italian choices in The Valley these days."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. It's amazing. The food is incredible and the atmosphere is unbeatable. You feel at home the second you walk in. It's owned by a family and they are serving cooking and hosting which is awesome. They make you feel invited in every way! Definitely try the summer salad and the funghi pizza. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Last night, we took the kids to Base Pizzeria to check it out - after all, in a city that TripAdvisor deems one of the top 10 pizza cities in the country, we've gotta check out a new place that opens right down the street from our house. Walked in and at first glance, it didn't seem too child-friendly - there were no booths where we could pen in the kids and the bar was rightthere. But once we were seated at a table near the pizza oven, it was immediately apparent that the staff and ownership were not only exceedingly friendly, but exceedingly child-friendly. Each table was covered with brown construction paper and the kids had plenty of crayons and could write wherever they wanted on the table. Our waiter (brother of the owner, who also came by several times) mingled with the kids and played along with Kalen's chit-chattiness. The pizza station was separated by clear glass, allowing the kids to watch the pizza making and cooking. And when their pizza came, the kids actually ate it (they are notoriously difficult when it comes to actually eating their own food), which is a great testament to the pizza.  Only once did Cora have a mini-meltdown when she declared ownership over all of Kalen's crayons, but I took her outside for a few minutes (as I've done countless times over the last year) and she understood exactly what she had done wrong. She walked back in and gave Kalen a hug and shared the crayons nicely.   When I walked back in with Cora, the patrons all gave me a knowing smile and it became really evident to me and Gina that the staff's attitudes toward children had influenced the rest of the diners. It's amazing how much staff understanding of the situation and doing the right thing results in an infinitely better dining experience.  Oh, and our pizza. It was really good. Crust had the right combination of crispy and chewiness. The tomato sauce was just the right tanginess.   I highly recommend Base - While Parlour, Pomo, and Bianco have attained superstardom, Base can't be too far behind."}
{"text":"THE new \"You Gotta Try this Place !!!\"   Every one of these 5 star reviews say it all. All the pizzas are terrific, even the GF crust option. Be sure to try the delish PLOUGHMAN PLATTER to start with your wine. The Wine selection is fab. Ross is the sommelier that is super energized at guiding you to your perfect choice for dinner.   All the owners are going to make your visit a pleasure.  Just their personality will turn your bad day around. Great non alcoholic drinks to choose as well.  Ask about the Passport coffees and teas. When you're there, say \"Hi\" to Jake in the kitchen (formerly of Hava Java) showing off his culinary skills."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I had to ask for salt and pepper three times. Over priced compared to other pizza in the area. Gluten free pizza was not good at all."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive service. Our beet salad was great. We liked the pizza texture but did not like the sweetness of the Caramelized onions. I think we just ordered the wrong pizza. Savory on a pizza is great but sweet....not so much. We will try a different pizza next time"}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch. From the beautiful view to the delicious pizza and salad to the fantastic drinks and finally the sweet manager Meagan it was a fabulous experience. One of our new favorite places. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about the owners and their wonderful creations! My family and I came here for a late dinner and spent about 2 hours relaxing, drinking wine, and enjoying delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Just tried this place.  Friendly staff.  Pizza was very good.  Not a very large menu, however, thoughtfully creative.  We'll go back again."}
{"text":"Our family loves Base!  We come here regularly and always have a wonderful meal.  We just celebrated my son's fourth birthday at Base, per his request!"}
{"text":"First trip last week at lunch. Service gets an A, Food gets an A. The place was emptier than it should have been at lunch on a Friday, nearly all of us opted to sit on the patio facing Lincoln and Squaw Peak. Given how crowded and noisy many area places are at lunch, maybe that's a good thing but based on my experience they deserve to be busier. I never went inside as my guest was on the Patio when I arrived but the interior looked clean and modern from outside. Server was friendly and informative and we went with his recommendations on a special pizza and the appetizer of the day which was roasted purple cauliflower steak or heads, with a light cream sauce and crushed nuts. Both were delicious and came out very fast. They have a large selection of wines and a full bar as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service (even on Xmas eve!) and great pizza! Beet bruschetta, spicy snag and roni ... All outstanding."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  I have driven by so many times because I thought the signage was still for the previous restaurant  (Cafe Daniel - just a miserable place).  Noticed the new singe above the doors and checked it out.  Delicious and creative.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone.  To top the food, the service was outstanding!   They treat you like family and meet all expectations!  Well done! These Aussies have produced a winner  Cheers"}
{"text":"Mr. B. and I came here for Date Night last Friday and were impressed with the service. We were immediately greeted by a hostess who offered us a few options for seating, something we appreciated.   Atmosphere (4): Very clean and inviting. I especially appreciated the open feel of the restaurant. Being able to see everything from the front door to the back was great. The place was not overly crowded but, there were not a lot of empty tables. The noise level was not too bad; we could easily hold a conversation without yelling across the table at one another.  Service (5): Service was great. Very attentive and accommodating.    Food (4): Loved the olives with bread starter. They serve local Noble Bread (Phoenix), which is the absolute best. The Amalfi Salad was great. We opted for an El Diablo and a Piggly; Mr. B. was not a fan of the Piggly. I enjoyed them both though.   Price (4): For the location and quality, the price was expected.   Overall, we would return. The environment is perfect for date night or hanging with friends."}
{"text":"Sooo good.  From the perfect pizzas (thin crust, traditional and gourmet), to the oils adding different levels of spice to the pies (the oils, their creation), to the homemade dry tiramisu (with kahlua), best I've EVER had, fantastic selection of wines by the glass, this place is killer.  Do yourself a favor and check out their immaculate and stylish restroom just to get a peek at what a restaurant lavatory could look like.  Attention to detail is found everywhere!  Genuinely enthused, here!  Gorgeous patio view of Piestewa Peak with a blanket at each table during the chillier months.  And the personable Aussie owners (all three) and their loyal staff are integral to making the atmosphere of this place exceptional!  Beet salad, tiramisu, meat lovers pizza . . . some of my favorite offerings after about five times dining here.    Don't miss this rare find, I say."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego. This place is a gem. Great service all around. Menu is fantastic and truly organic. We had a Chook pizza and by far one of the best pizzas we had in a long time. Big plus is that they allow pets on the patio. Highly recommend this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time!  Went with house recommendations on everything and it was amazing.  Great service as well!"}
{"text":"Our large group went to Base the other day and had the best time. Two had been there before and suggested it. Bar  and outside patio service was great and the seven pizzas sampled were the best Ive had in years.  Kudos to the owners and staff and will make this a regular stop in the future."}
{"text":"This place has it all going on.  Really great food with farm fresh ingredients that taste amazing. Super cool owners who are fun and care about their customers!"}
{"text":"Thanks to all you yelpers for writing about Base!   After reading the reviews we had to check it out and we're so glad we did. We've been there for lunch and dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the staff.  Their take on pizza is different than what I am accustomed to, but quite good.   We particularly like the Chook pizza.The ploughman appetizer is extremely good, plenty to share with the table.  The service/staff are, as others have written, like long-time friends. It just feels great walking in to this place and be greeted so warmly.   The other night waiting for take out, we noticed they had Pimms behind the bar, so we had to try a Pimms cup. Absolutely wonderful, refreshing on a hot evening.   The owners and staff make you hope they will be a success. The quality of the restaurant and food give you confidence they will. As one other reviewer wrote, they really do seem to be hitting on all cylinders."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place for fresh food and ingredients!  While others say farm-to-table, here I think they really live it.  They also have (unbelievable as it is) a gluten free pizza crust worth eating!!  No kidding, my gluten-loving friends actually finished my slices as they were so good. The owners are friendly, the salads are amazing, and the view of the mountain is spectacular.  Fantastic all around!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night with my wife. Place is cozy and charming. The wood fired pizzas are excellent. I recommend \"The Meaty One\". It took a little while to get the food so the server/owner brought over a little olive sampler while we waited which was nice while having a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, amazing view. Try their spicy olive oils."}
{"text":"Megan at the bar is fantastic! She has great ideas to make your dinner yummy. We had a wonderful crispy prosciutto salad! Fun, flavorful and big enough to share! Mmmmm Mmmm! Jimmy made our Sweet and Spicy Snag Pizza. WOW! (Snag which is Australian for sausage ). Excellent job Jimmy! What a delicious pizza! By the way they have a wonderful Zinfandel, by Joel Gott! Excellent and reasonably priced!! Oh, and all their ingredients are oregano! Excellent offerings.  And if you need more input ask for Chef, yes just Chef or if you work here you get away with calling him Chef-fie-poo. Good times, fun people, great food!"}
{"text":"Tried two pies based on the glowing reviews. While the staff was friendly and the interior of the restaurant respectable, the pizza was a let down. We had the White Truffle and the Chook. The White Truffle was fair and had descent flavor. The Chook was a big disappointment. The chicken was dry, the potatoes flavorless. The crusts on both were just mediocre. With so many other solid performers in the area I can't understand the high praise for a pizza that's on par with the likes of MOD."}
{"text":"Incredible service, amazing owners and even better food. The wood fired pizza experience is one that you have to try... and The Base takes it to a new level with organic ingredients and creations that you have never seen but have to try (enter the \"Chook\" pizza). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Robust delish flavors in the organic salad as well as the pizza bravo great food Base!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! They have a great wine selection and all fresh, organic  ingredients for their delicious food (the Prawn and the Mediterranean pizzas are my personal favorites). They can accommodate any dietary need too! Will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous staff and amazing food.  I highly recommend the Pear and Rocket salad! !! Clean, organic, and Gluten free food. Family friendly or a great place to bring a date.  If you're looking to hear some awesome Australian accents....this is the place.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Base pizza definitely gets five stars! Great quality food paired with great friendly service from good people and atmosphere. Very cool spot!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, locally owned and all organic ingredients. Everything was very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"For an impromptu lunch while out and about, we found this restaurant a refreshing blend of creative and fresh pizza options, including today's white pizza, topped with caramelized onion, butternut squash, bacon and arugula.  My husband's palate is more selective than mine, so we can rarely share a dish.  However, the gracious and discerning owner Michael adjusted the pizza and placed bacon and cheese on my husband's half, leaving my side as originally created. We also splurged with Pavlova for desert (a must try). When you add the patio view of the Phoenix Mt. Preserve, it made a perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"We continue to return to BP time and again.  It only goes better and better..... friendly staff, casual ambiance and expanding menu. Each time we walk away satisfied and with smiles on our faces. It is our go-to place with family and friends. You can beat it and wouldn't even want to try."}
{"text":"New neighborhood spot which recently opened. Very comfortable and relaxed setting. The white pizza was fantastic, it was perfectly creamy and cheesy while not being too overdone. I actually preferred their pizza to some of the other neighborhood hot spots.. LGO, the parlor etc. good variety of pizza, salad and apps with great service."}
{"text":"Base is my favorite neighborhood place! Not only is the food absolutely phenomenal, the owners (who also work there) are just the most lovely, warm and welcoming folks. The staff is always so friendly. The food - WOW. The combinations they come up with are delicious and creative. They use local vendors and really try to work in as much \"farm to table\" as they can. Definitely try the Ploughman's Platter - it's perfect to share. As for pizza, well... I actually don't eat pizza... but Base's pizza is the exception to that rule. :) Their crust isn't thick - it's the perfect ratio of crust to pizza topping, if that makes sense. You don't feel \"stuffed\" after eating a slice or two. Their wine list is awesome and the Pavlova dessert is a must (you may not want to share that one...but it's also not small, so save room if you're going at it solo). I also love the atmosphere: you can dress up for dinner if you feel compelled to do so... or, you can wear yoga pants and throw your hair up. (I speak from experience.) It's not pretentious. It's restaurant perfection."}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting a business next door and was stoked with the meal. Great people. Great service.  Excellent pizza! Support this small family owned business as now that we have found it we don't want it going anywhere."}
{"text":"Organic fresh pizza, good wine, excellent service!  Quiet atmosphere.  Plus 1/2 off pizza after 3 on Tuesdays!  Pizza is similar to Pomo but organic and less expensive.  Excellent place.  We really enjoyed our meal and are sharing this with friends"}
{"text":"Base Pizzeria happens to be right next to the nail salon my wife is fond of, which is where we were today. I was done with my pedi first, so I wandered over to check out our new neighborhood Pizzeria. I wasn't hungry, but good pizza is not as common as one might believe, so I was very interested in the place.   From the moment I walked through the door, I was impressed. The owners, a couple of Aussie brothers-in-law, were genuinely nice guys, and immediately made me feel welcome. I liked the place. Personable owners involved in their business are critically important to achieving success. They had that covered, hands down. But Base is a pizzeria, and the pizza had better be good. Especially since there is no pasta or wings.   I ordered a simple cheese pizza. Thumbs up! Seriously good pizza. All of it. The crust, the sauce, and the cheese. Really good. My wife wandered over when she was done with her mani, pedi, and ordered the hummus. Another hit. Very good stuff.   Base Pizzeria will be in our restaurant rotation. They are very convenient for us, I would encourage anyone to give it a try, even if it's a bit of a drive. It will be worth it."}
{"text":"Take out was awesome first time eating and there will be second, third, etc..... The service is great and the food is even better"}
{"text":"Real Italian Pizza: thin crust, excellent tomato sauce and good mozzarella. We started with their  special burrata salad, and burrata was fresh and perfectly paired with tomato jam and balsamic vinegar.  The lady owner was super friendly and helpful. Ambiance was beautiful and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"It is hard to find great Pizza in PHX. This pizza was great with Tipo OO flour. Great crust and dough.The only recommendation is San Marzano Tomatoes for the sauce. The Nutella Pizza is epic. Just a little different with Aussie's owning a Pizza Joint"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Phoenix when we discovered this place for a quick bite to eat after our mid-morning hike. I was a bit skeptical of strip mall pizza, but after seeing the reviews and hearing my stomach, we decided to give it a shot.  We split the dips/flatbread as well as the Piggy pizza. Dips included a hummus and a baba ganoush. Pizza was European style with arugula leaves, cheese and prosciutto  added after it was cooked. It was the perfect amount of food to split for a late lunch and everything was delish. My husband loved the hot pepper infused olive oils, especially the ghost pepper (he's been inspired to infuse his own at home)!  Even better than the food was the service and the atmosphere. While we sat out on the patio the staff was attentive and engaging to all of the customers, of which many I could tell were regulars they recognized by name. We will definitely return the next time we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Some friends introduced us to this little restaurant a few nights ago, exclaiming its virtues as serving wonderful Pizza.   It's got great views of Squaw Peak, being as its foreground view is the parking lot.. But no matter.  This space was formerly rented by a fellow named Danny who lacked the warmth and personality of a great restauranteur.    The current owners are an Australian  couple and her brother and they couldn't have been friendlier or nicer or more accommodating.   They allow well behaved dogs on their patio which is always a plus for us!    The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the pizza after slice number two got to be pretty pretty pretty dry.    But ...we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"How does this place have such high reviews ? Got a quick takeout last week and a very rude probably drunk or on drugs as it seemed kid was doing takeout. I guess that could be harsh but it's a shame if that is his real personality. The pizza ? The cheese fell off in one bite (usually a sign of cheap cheese ) and the sauce was so sweet it was as if sugar was added to it , like a lot of sugar. The saving grace was the crust and the price for what we got . Probably the not be returning."}
{"text":"This is the perfect casual cozy spot!  We went after hiking, sat outside, had the ploughman's platter and a bottle of wine - superb!  The platter had plenty of food for two and was so savory and fresh!  I'm going to have them make some for a cocktail party for me!  Their pizza's are also excellent and creative. NGo!  You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Quite simply a killer little pizza place. Great staff, even if they do have funny accents, great food and a lovely space. The crispy prosciutto salad is tasty with lots of prosciutto and the Spicy Snag pizza is my favourite with house made sausage and sautéed onions. Rumor has it that there is occasionally Ghost Chili oil behind the bar."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time on 1/12 around 6:15.  We were seated right away (without a reservation) at a very nice table outside on the patio.  Our waiter greeted us right away and took our drink order.  We explained that we were waiting for our daughter to arrive from work, so we weren't ready to order any food yet.  He was so nice an attentive and did not rush us at all.  By the time she did arrive (traffic) it was 6:45 and our waiter came right over to set her up with a cocktail.  We ordered salad to share and we each ordered a pizza.  My pizza was a special that evening with pepperoni,asparagus and mozzarella.  It was absolutely delicious.  Some friends then stopped by and our waiter kindly let us pull up a couple more chairs for them.  We ended up ordering more wine for the table and had a fun evening.  We will definitely be back to this fabulous pizzeria again.  Thanks Base pizza!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Phoenix!  Found this while here attending a convention. Fun place, Great Food!  Top notch staff, Roscoe was top notch. So good I brought some more colleges with me a couple evenings later. Unusual menu an great selection of Australian beers."}
{"text":"This place is an easy 5 stars!!  After walking out of Central Bistro down the street due to disappointing service we totally lucked out and had a great date night dinner at Base!  We were seated immediately inside as the patio was full but looked really nice and even had blankets over the chairs.  Our happy, friendly waitress came immediately and asked if we wanted sparking water or \"table\"water in her awesome Australian accent!  To drink I ordered the hard apple cider and it was really good.  I ordered the mushroom truffle pizza and it was fresh and yummy.  They recommended the Caramelized onions and I probably should have added them as it would have given it a little sweetness but it was light and fresh and delicious just as it was. My boyfriend chose his own pizza and put roasted peppers Caramelized onions, and the sausage and cheese on it and it was really good too.  I'm not a sausage person but the meat was actually really tasty on it.  We had exceptional service, prices were good,  food was fresh and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed.  I think this is going to be one of our new go to neighborhood joints."}
{"text":"Nice wood fired pizza. Lovely sauce, fresh yummies, perfect thin crust!  All in a warm spacious spot.  Friendly and fun even for a family with kids 4 & 6."}
{"text":"I visited Base in March for the first time. The pizza was really good. I love thin crust and they do it perfectly. Service was great. I think the salads could use more ingredients, a little sparse but the dressings were nice and original."}
{"text":"Absolutely insanely good pizza! Thin crust, fresh ingredients and you gotta try the spicy olive oils. Such a great experience. The best!"}
{"text":"Mmm, came here on a 115 degree afternoon and the place was empty--- which made me nervous. A friend had told to check it out and it was delicious. The bruschetta to start was great but the star of the show is the pizza. I wish i could try them all! I had the ziggy piggy- it was light and perfect for summer in Phoenix. I will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Lovely lunch..organic local ingredients. . great service.. beet salad divine. .but the person service we received was above and beyond come try this new place ... you won't be sorry.."}
{"text":"Having enjoyed pizza from Chicago, to Rome to New York, Base has to be one of the best pizza spots I've ever been to. Had the white truffle with soppressata and my only regret was that I didn't eat slower to make every bite last longer. Pizza comes out fast (800 degree wood oven), staff is kind and attentive, and the ambiance is cool. This place is a gem and it's going to be one of my first stops next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent food, we had bruschetta, a beet salad, and 2 pizza's.  Interesting beer selection, I had a Cooper's from Australia and thought that was awesome too. Service and atmosphere also top notch. One of the best servers that I can remember having.  I'm coming back for sure and can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Cute place with a parking lot side patio. Service was great but we will not be back. The pizza was really nothing special and the salad was weak."}
{"text":"Ya, the pizza here is pretty awesome. If there's a fault here is that they don't serve and draft beer. The owners are an Australian couple and they're super friendly and work really hard at their own restaurant. You'll see them bust their butts along with the rest of the staff and that's super respectable."}
{"text":"been wanting to come in for a while from all the good review Finley did stated off with the pear salad it was just OK to me it was to acidic no stand out flavor all so had the Mediterranean pizza that's where they lost me pizza with soft a little undercooked for a Wood-Fired oven didn't have enough char in the bottom what to expect from that style pizza the sauce was just crush tomato's witch would be grate if it had herbs and seasoning they didn't put any of their fresh-made mozzarella they put parmesan cheese instead which overpowers all the other flavors considering Kalamata olives are pretty flavorful as it is the server was grate she was fast made suggestions but for me over all it was as average"}
{"text":"This was a great find. The pizza was fresh and delicious. We had the Sweet & Spicy Snag and the Beet Salad. It was a beautiful day to sit on the patio.  Met the owner and he was amazing. He even talked me into trying one of their organic Australian beers. They infuse their own olive oil with a spicy kick. We don't mind paying a little more for fresh local ingredients. It was fun to hear about all the different area farms they buy product from. We're looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the door the happy vibe surrounded me. We were welcomed by the owner who immediately seated us. We were celebrating my kids anniversary with their baby in tow.  So the food.... Delicious... I was told we were going to a pizzeria... Which base is... But it is truly do much more. My son decided on what we would eat. The beet salad was fresh from the garden and delish! The 3 pizzas we ordered were amazing as well as the beers we drank. Ending the dinner with tiramisu and candles brought this evening to a happily ever after ending. And a side note... The owners wife couldn't have been more pleasant to us"}
{"text":"Really lovely spot! Pizza is so delicious and the service is nothing short of awesome. The spicy oils they serve with the pizza is what keeps us coming back. The sauce on the pizzas is arguably some of the best pizza sauce in the valley!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Phoenix. I only found it because I did yoga at the studio next door and wanted some dinner after.....blown away impressed by this place- the ambiance, the food, the staff and the owners! Everything about the place and execution is super polished. All I can say is wow!!!   Had the Mediterranean pizza without cheese.....you know when you have an amazing pizza without cheese, that you found a great spot. The beet/kale salad was ON POINT. Drink selection is fantastic.   I am in town for 5 more days and I'll 100% be going back at least once more, this time with friends.   The coolest thing in my opinion is that when I asked my waiter who owned the place, he actually pointed them out as they were hustling away - one was making pizzas and one was helping guests.....talk about dedication. They obviously are bad-asses and everyone should support this place."}
{"text":"Fresh food, reasonable prices, great location and nice people. Be sure to try the hot chili oils, they are delish. We plan to visit here weekly, it's a fun place."}
{"text":"So I have this weird obsession with anything from Australia. I now only shop online from Australian clothing boutiques (check out HelloMolly.com, it's amaze), my favorite animal is the koala (it's not a bear, so don't even ask), and now I have a new Australian obsession: Base!  This place is owned by the freaking cutest Australian couple. The woman is at least 8 months preggers and is still managing to whip through the restaurant with a genuine smile on her face and clearly a love for their business. The pizza was awesome. I had the one with roasted peppers, soppressata (I think), and another meat. It was perfectly leoparded - yes, that's the true test of a good pizza. Look for the leopard crust. For dessert we had the largest tiramisu I've ever seen, and the service was awesome.  This place lived up to the hype for sure. I definitely recommend getting there early - it's a pretty small space, and by the time 7:30pm hits on a Friday they're at-capacity."}
{"text":"Love The pizza.   Love the mountain view.  Megan gave us excellent recommendations.  She is awesome as is the puzza"}
{"text":"They are super hospitable. Food and pizza is also great! Nearly finished a whole pie by myself!"}
{"text":"Came to Base for the first time last Friday night, purely based on the Yelp rating and I was not disappointed.  Great atmosphere and very clean.  Was greeted by the hostess right away and was lucky enough to have one of the Aussie owners be my server (think his name was Rocco).  Had the ploughman platter to share with Mrs Z and it was exceptional.  Probably the best meat and cheese board in the city hands down.  Followed this up with a Spicy Snag and Pesto Chicken Pizza.  Both were amazing and so flavorful.  Crust was perfect and you can see they put that wood fired oven to good use.  Wine and Beer list was exceptional.  I had one of the Coopers beers to start and then we had an amazing bottle of the Sharecroppers Pinot.  Finished with a Pavlova dessert.  Wowza.  Must try it to believe it.  Amazing experience all around."}
{"text":"My favorite place. You just can't go wrong. Neighborhood locals and the owners seem to know everyone. Every pizza is delicious and the nightly specials are so different and creative."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here hoping for excellent pizza and were certainly not disappointed. We had the Caprese appetizer, a Mediterranean pizza, a couple of beers, and closed it out with an espresso ice cream dessert. Everything was great, clean, and about as healthy as I'm comfortable with when it comes to pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"We came in at 9PM and were given superb service. We were worried about being rushed out but the owners let us take our time ordering and eating your meal. We ordered the 'Meaty One' pizza and the crispy prosciutto salad and they were both delicious. The house-infused olive oils complemented our food well too.   Aside from the food, the warm hospitality and kindness of the Aussie owners were the highlight for us. Their recommendations were spot on and they were a pleasure to chat with! They are well travelled and we had a great time exchanging travel tips with each other."}
{"text":"This place was killer! Ordered the pear and rocket salad. It was light and fresh tasting! All the ingredients crisp and delicious. Then we had the chook pizza with added mozzarella. It was fantastic. The combinations were a beautiful marriage of excellent pizza and a gourmet Sunday dinner! I loved it. We finished our meal off with lemon pie in a cup! It tasted just like the name. Refreshing and tangy and not too sweet! The service was very kind and warm. We felt like regulars on our first visit. Very cute Aussie accent!"}
{"text":"So I Just had gluten free pizza for myself and my fam had reg pizza. Seriously so good. One thing all gluten free people know: gluten free pizza SUCKS. This destroys that idea completely. I would eat this as often as possible if I lived in the city (visiting). I had the El Diablo- obvi loved it. My fam had the Marg. and an El Diablo with regular crust and downed it all. Happy all around. Can't wait to come back.  Other perk? The owners are AMAZING! I wanted to be friends with these people. So personable. So nice. So funny. Love them. They care so much about the food they're putting out, the customers, and the space. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our caprese salad, meat pizza and noble bread, which I'd give 4 stars. But what made it all very tasty was the olive oils they provided to accompany the bread and pizza. The ghost pepper olive oil was so good with the noble bread and the pizza too! Beer and wine selection also gets 5 stars and the view of Piestewa Peak was just gorgeous."}
{"text":"Food is so delicious. Best pizza I've ever had in the area. This place will be on your list of regular spots. Certainly is on regular list now. Go try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and very friendly service. The spicy snag is my favorite. Very good pasta specials. The infused oils are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, amazing service and amazing food!  This place is definitely worth trying out! The owners are so friendly and as sweet as can be with their Australian accents. They are truly there to make your experience the best possible. And the food....no words to describe the unique menu and specialty salads and pizzas!  We want one in our own town!"}
{"text":"I was there last night and the bar was packed. Pizza was amazing!!!! Tastes very fresh - the sauce is yum. And I am a pizza connoisseur."}
{"text":"Love this new pizza place! The owners are beyond fabulous-so friendly and upbeat! They were great with our kids-had us all laughing and having a great time!  The food was fantastic! I love how all of their ingredients are organic! Everything was so fresh tasting! I highly recommend the crispy prosciutto salad and the mushroom truffle pizza! Both were off the charts good! My son got the shrimp pizza and he said it was the best shrimp he has ever had! And let me tell you-he loves shrimp, so that is a compliment!   I have been telling everyone about this wonderful new place! So in love!"}
{"text":"This place met all expectations.  The pizza was good; we had the El Diablo and Truffle pizza.  The truffle was good but very strong truffle flavor so be sure you really love truffle oil before ordering. The El Diablo was light and fresh and amazing.   We sat on the patio looking at the mountains and blankets are provided for chilly nights.  The service is amazing too.   Tuesday's is 1/2 price on all pizzas!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Base the first time we ate here several months ago. The second time not as good as the first because the pizzas were a bit  oily/wet on the bottom. Their crust recipe is great and will come back for their tasty creations and hope it's cooked perfectly like our first visit."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall. Nice ambience otherwise. Chic and clean. Nice pizza choices. The AZ bread appetizer was great. \"Chook\"? pizza with chicken and potatoes on a tomato base was very tasty. The crust was perfectly cooked. I could eat 5 of these no problem! Pizzas are one size 11-12\" Will be back whenever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Base just keeps getting better.  Hard to believe. The Ploughmans platter is one of the best food offerings from any Arizona restaurant. Always unique and creative. WOW."}
{"text":"This pizza place is great! The two hilarious & personable Australian owners greet most  guests by their first name. The menu is wonderful and their pizza's are flavorful, using unique combinations of seasonal organic vegetables & meat. Sit outside on the patio and enjoy the gorgeous mountains."}
{"text":"We tried Base after a recommendation from a local while at a brewery. I have a couple of complaints about this place but let me start by saying all of our food was delicious, The service was good, and we got our pizza half off for being there on a Tuesday!   Now, my beef with the place is that it has a very pretentious feel to it. It's unfair to knock the restaurant too much for that because honestly i feel like it was more the patrons than anything about the restaurant.  We did get a slightly condescending attitude when the hostesses found out we didn't have a reservation despite the restaurant was half empty when we got there but once we sat our service was nothing but great! My wife and i came in work out clothes because we were in Arizona for a hiking trip and didn't bring anything else and we got several unnecessary stare downs.   But regardless...go for the pizza and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and the service was great. Cool to see family owned restaurants still exist! Only knock on the place it was a little spendy. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"the best shrimp I've ever had, one of the best pizzas I've ever had  owned by an Australian family- great and friendly people, excellent service   cool and cozy vibe   I'm glad the Biltmore has a place like this!"}
{"text":"Try the plougman player! Very good, service was great! Nice place atmosphere too! Sat at bar, gluten free options too"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Base Pizzeria, the moment i walk in the door, I'm greeted like a guest in their home! It's wonderful.   Then I have a seat at a table and I am immediately greeted with water and menu. Perfect.   Everything in the pizzeria is Organic for those of you who enjoy that aspect, but one thing I love and appreciate about Base Pizzeria is the fact that I can eat pizza and not feel as if I just broke my diet plan. The veggies are fresh and amazingly delicious. The salads are amazing. They put care into their product.   They are consistently serving me great customer service, great food, and great Organic Margaritas!   I will continue to come back, I will spread the word like wild fire."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service, rude and over an hour wait for two cheese pizzas !!!!! Unacceptable"}
{"text":"My beloved & I came to Arizona to spend time with family. We went on a mission to find the best pizza in Phoenix. We went to 3 different places : My Slice of the Pie, Pizza Bianco, And Base. I have to say as far as pizza goes, Base wins. The crust was beyond perfection, flavorful, sweet, perfectly crisp, and just a bit moist with olive oil - almost focaccia like. The classic tomato sauce was the best I've EVER tasted - FRESH, slightly sweet, & perfectly tangy. And the pepperoni was exactly what I look for.. Plus, our server was unpretentious and warm. I felt right at home."}
{"text":"What a place!! I have been to Base a number of times and each time the food, drinks and service have been 5 star!  check the specials board for something new to try and if you looking for a pizza .. The Chook is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Base twice a month for the past year so I'm way past due on leaving this review...  You can't go wrong with Base. They serve up some of the best food you'll ever have, and the team that works there is just absolutely perfect. I can't believe how consistently pleasant and genuinely welcoming every single employee is day in and day out. This place is an absolute treasure.   Tips: Ask about their infused olive oils. Half price pizza Tuesdays.  Get the pavlova!(!!!!)"}
{"text":"Very pleased to have this new spot in the neighborhood. The menu is full of delicious looking options to both eat and drink. I have done takeout twice and was very pleased on both occasions with both the service and the food. The Base (what I know to be a Margarita) pizza has been my favorite thus far. The owners are super attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. Thanks for coming to the area!"}
{"text":"I hate having to write bad reviews but it was clear that our waitress/hostess did not want to assist us. I came in to dinner last night with the little boy I nanny and we were told to pick a table. We sit down, and TEN minutes went by and we are finally brought menus and water. We are left for another 10 minutes a couple sits next to us and the waitress finally comes back to take our order. Fairly simple just the AZ easy bread and a margarita pizza. While we are waiting we see the couple next to us receive there food long before we did, meanwhile we were sitting there a good 30 minutes before these two arrived. Once the food came out our server was nowhere to be found. She stood idly by the bar not doing a single thing to the point where we had to flag her down just to get our check so we could finally leave. Definitely a disappointment. I'm 20 and with a 9 year old who is roughly the same height as me and we were clearly treated like we were children. My money is just as good as anyone else coming in to this establishment and should be treated as such."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients. Good choices for light dinners and salads. My only issue is that they don't really have any Arizona wine choices by the glass. I think visitors would enjoy trying a few local choices along with the others. I would give 5 stars if the wine/beer choices were a little more rounded out."}
{"text":"I try to wait at least a month before trying a new restaurant so that their kinks can be worked out. After reading all of the great reviews I decided to take a chance on Base Pizzeria, and I'm very glad that I did! My husband and I came here for dinner last night and were instantly welcomed by the owner as we walked through the door. The owners were so friendly, engaging and nice! They're very passionate about their business and it shows. The menu consists of mostly pizza, salad, a few appetizers and they have a variety of wine, bottled beer and spirits from Arizona Distilling Company. Everything they have is organic and locally sourced. I always love being able to support local!  We chose the crispy proscuitto salad and the El Diablo pizza with a Pinot Noir for me and a Kellerweiss for my husband. I had ordered the Pinot Noir on the menu board, but was also given a taste of a bottle which they already had open. I ended up liking the tasting better than the one I had ordered, and will keep that in mind for next time. It was great that they had offered it to me so I could discover something new. The salad and pizza arrived quickly and both were fresh and wonderfully flavored. The proscuitto on the salad was crisped to perfection almost like a super thin bacon, all of the veggies were fresh and the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette had just the right bite. The El Diablo pizza had a slightly sweet hand crushed tomato sauce, which was very light and tasted of perfectly ripened tomatoes. The sopressata was delicate on spice, just enough to not overpower any of the other flavors. High quality Kalamata olives and roasted peppers made for a well-rounded dish. I would not hesitate to order either of these again.  In a neighborhood with tons of pizza options available you would think that they would have some stiff competition. With the high quality organic ingredients that they're using, incredibly welcoming service and delicious food, Base Pizzeria is a step above the rest. I have no worries that they'll be successful and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Props to them for putting together such a well-oiled machine in such a short amount of time."}
{"text":"This pizzeria was absolutely fantastic. I had the pleasure of being served by the owner. He was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was absolutely phenomenal. 10 out 10 would definitely come back. Bring the family and enjoy the beautiful view and amazing food."}
{"text":"The pizza here at Base was one of the very best pizzas we've ever eaten. The crust was excellent, perfectly cooked and the sauce tasted like fresh tomatoes. We just got the Base pizza and it was truly excellent. Also the service was so friendly. We are from out of town, but we will definitely be back when we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to go in the valley! The food is fresh and delicious and the staff and owners make you feel so welcome every single time you come in! They also have a great outdoor space with great views! I have not one bad thing to say about this place it embodies everything a 5 star  place should be!"}
{"text":"Hitting on all cylinders already.  The wood fired oven is kept hot enough to get a nice leopard spot pattern of char marks on the bottom and a crisp texture to the dough.  Unlike some pizzerias that leave a huge thick doughy edge with no toppings around the perimeter, Base covers the entire pizza and does not have the extra thick edge.  I liked that!  The pizza choices include classics and a few of their own, with optional add ons.  All the ingredients are organic, very fresh and delicious.  The wine list is not extensive but very good and well matched to the vibe and the food.  A full bar stands by along one side of the dining room.  When the weather cools off, the patio will be first choice, having great views of the mountain preserve.  The three Aussie owners are all fun and friendly.  Two mates and one cheeky Sheila.    We expect to become regulars at this great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! I had to ask for water twice while the waitress was standing. The pizza was cooked, but we did not see anything spectacular. I will not be back."}
{"text":"\"Bringing food back to Base\" is the concept of this pizza place located in the Biltmore area. A couple of super friendly Aussies with a passion for \"clean eating\" own this establishment. They make creative wood-fired pizzas made from scratch using locally sourced, organic ingredients. I ordered the mixed olives to start and the Spicy Snag pizza (organic crushed tomato & chili, pork & fennel sausage, and caramelized onions - delicious!). Here are their 3 principles they live by on their website - Look after yourself, Look after the environment, Look after your community. This was a great find and a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Riddle me this.  What if someone told you some of the best pizza in town was near the Biltmore.  So far so good?  Next you find out its made Neapolitan style.  Sounds like a winner.  Now what if I told you the restaurant was run by a trio of Aussie ex-pats?  Your reaction to this revelation would probably consist of (1) Huh?, (2) What?, or (3) WTF?  Welp, meet the trio.  Rossco Lukje, Rossco's sister Carlee Lukje, and Carlee's husband Michael Sands.  Years of experience between the three of them (and Rossco finding his future bride on a chance visit to Phoenix) led this trio to take a shot at opening a neapolitan pizzeria and wine bar just a stones throw from the Biltmore neighborhood.  The Phoenix area has no shortage of great neapolitan pizzerias (hell Downtown Phoenix alone has four world class ones), but as I write this Base carries the distinction of highest rated Phoenix pizzeria on Yelp.  For dinner on Sunday, I brought my Dad along with me to see what these renegade Aussies were up to.  You'll find Base on the southwest corner of 32nd Street and Lincoln (just east of the Coldwell Banker office in back).  While the shopping center itself isn't much to look at from the street, Base has occupied a spot that provides a beautiful view of the nearby Phoenix Mountain Preserve.  Its particularly gorgeous to look north toward the preserve at sunset (hot tip for all you guys looking for a dinner date idea).  There's seating both inside and out (I'd guess seating for about 60 or so in all) and a decor that is both casual and classy.  The menu at Base is a balance between true Italian classics as well as some in house inventions and improvisations that Rossco comes up with.  In fact they have a special pizza almost on a regular basis.  Tonight my Dad and I stuck largely to the menu in front of us.  I love a good meaty pie so I ordered the Meaty One.  Tomato sauce, pepperoni, soppressata, pork and fennel sausage, and Fior De Latte cheese.  My Dad ordered the Pesto Chicken.  Housemade cilantro pesto sauce, sliced organic free range chicken, cherry tomatoes, sunflower seeds, and Fior de Latte cheese.  In addition to wines, they have a fairly impressive beer selection including a number of microbrews from Australia if you're game.  I stuck with local and went with a Lumberyard Lager.  In about 5 minutes after ordering, our pizzas arrived at our table hot out of the oven.  The pizzas were phenomenal.  The meats on the Meaty One were juicy and delicious, with each offering its own textural note and spice level.  I also really loved the pesto sauce they used on the Pesto Chicken and the chicken had an almost buttery texture even while it was fully cooked (those lean free range chickens must make all the difference).  The crust was also cooked perfectly with a nice soft interior and great crunch on the exterior.  One characteristic I will say that stands out about Base relative to other neapolitan pizzerias I've tried is the crust tastes a little grainier.  I'm not sure what to attribute this to, but maybe they're using a little more wheat flour?  Just a guess.  No complaints either way.  The dessert menu is a rotating one so I asked what was available.  One of the items they were serving tonight an Australian dish called a Pavlola.  I had zero idea what this was but it was depicted to me as a meringue layer cake.  Sounds good to me.  My Dad warned me in advance that he wasn't going to help me with dessert.  Turns out I needed his help more than I knew.  This cake slice was literally the equivalent of a size 8 shoe.  The waiter profusely assured me it wasn't as intimidating as it looked, but I was legit scared.  The cake was indeed super light and airy and the berry compote that came with it was excellent, but despite my best efforts, I took a lot of it home.    Total cost for my share including the beer, Meaty One pizza, Pavlova dessert, tax, and tip came to about $35.  I really love Base's fearlessness in terms of mixing tradition with locally and organically sourced ingredients and even some non-Italian influences.  The views from this pizzeria are hard to beat and the staff was super enthusiastic during our entire visit.  So apparently Aussies know their neapolitan pizzas too, and it just so happens that three of them decided Phoenix was the perfect place to open one.  Lucky us."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an amazing experience here. The food was wonderful and the hosts were very welcoming and fun.  Everything we are was incredible.  The smokey hummus is the best I have had. It's is hard to believe there still exist places with great food and sensible prices.  I hope to return here next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Very cool new pizza place - Aussie owners again (2nd new place this week!) - they were very nice and very friendly.  We started with the Pear and Rockets salad (Arugula, pears, local nuts, etc.) - it was really nice.  Ordered a couple of their wood fired pizzas - mine was the Spicy Snag (homemade sausage, carmelized onions...good stuff!) - crust was very good - nice char, leopard spots on the bottom, no flour or cornmeal, and most importantly, very tasty.  Sauce was very nice as well.  After saving room for dessert (and boxing up leftover pizza and salad for lunch for later), we split the banana bread dessert - two pieces of scrumptious banana bread with two small scoops of local berry ice cream - not too big - just the right amount to top off a lovely evening.  Give this place a go!"}
{"text":"I have that pie in the sky dream. One day, after some hard work, achievement, toughness and fortitude, I'll have worked my way through all the pizza to find the one that is truly the best. Excitement built for I knew it was coming, it's so close I can taste it, base pizza was it, for sure, it had to be!  The server was super sweet, kind and friendly. She asked about our drinks and I inquired if they had any house specialties. After being informed they have a full bar and I should order anything I want, I asked if they had Luxardo cherries. With a quick yes from her, I replied, a Manhattan, Makers 46, up, with extra Luxardo cherries; Four Roses it was, as the bar doesn't stock makers 46. Looking for something interesting and different as an appetizer, we went with the pita and dip, today's dips were a sweet bean something or another, I didn't catch that one and a roasted spicy pepper hummus! This is gonna be good!   The manhattan arrived and before my first sip, I inquired about the cherries, they were not Luxardo. Not to sound pompous, but Luxardos don't have a stem so immediately I knew something was afoot. She assured me they were non gmo, organic and contained no yellow and red dye or coloring. To be honest I didn't particularly care about those qualities, that isn't really the reason I order Luxardo, you simply must try them to know, and once you do, you'll never go back. Once you've had the best, it's difficult to want something else. I soldiered forward, and the first sip was something other than delicious. In regards to the drinks at I'll leave you with, Base Pizza doesn't make their reputation on their crafty cocktails, if you know what I'm saying.  The hummus surely will perk me up, it is after all, probably one of my most favorite snacks! Tasty, but gritty is how I'd describe the hummus. A good flavor, right up there with some of the best, but I've certainly had better and a few more minutes in the food processor would not have hurt here either. It was good but I won't go out of my way for his dish again.   Along with their pizza they have a gimmicky pairing of varying spice levels of infused olive oil. I say gimmicky because the olive oils could be of much better quality and spice for the sake of spice on Italian food / pizza doesn't seem to bode well for me. They've got a ghost chile, Jalepeno, and one or two other options. It felt to me like a masking of sub par olive oil with the gimmick of spice. Many people seem to enjoy it, but I don't think I'll have much more than the first taste I took of this olive oil infusion. I'd suggest sampling the oil before applying it to your pizza and come to your own conclusion on how delicious it is or not.  The pizza was solid, tasty dough, the tomato sauce was good, the toppings were all fresh. I'd definitely have another pizza, if I lived close by. If you're here on a Tuesday, they've also got half priced pizzas. Alas, I've got more preferable pizza closer to where I live and I just can't see myself going out of the way.  Over all, I won't knock the pizza too much, everyone has their opinion on the best in town and mine is somewhere else, but theirs certainly is tasty. I don't think I'd ever order an off menu drink from their bar, and I don't feel like their hummus is worth ordering. The service was awesome, with the one snafu regarding the whole cherry thing.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome people run \"Base\" who love their work which creates an incredible environment to enjoy great food, wine and beer! Casual excellence. Love the place."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for Valentine's day, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. Service was impeccable, food was delicious, and the atmosphere was casual but upscale. They run a Tuesday special, 50% off pizzas, and they honored it even on Valentines day... Class act! We are fans and will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Base as we kept driving by and were curious. Nice atmosphere but loud. We had a small group with two children. The service was so poor and the pizza was not great. We waited so long for our food, water and drinks and then our table was never cleared so we sat with a full table of dirty dishes. Three pizzas, two salads and a couple drinks totaled $230 which included gratuity. Expensive, poor quality pizza and terrible service means we won't be back. Phoenix has SO many great restaurants and this is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Check out the special up on the chalkboard and the ploughman platter is a bit different every time (Also worth it)."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!  Pizza and beer isn't a normal dinner for us as we save it for very special occasions only.  Last night was reason for Pizza and Beer!   I walked in and noticed how cute the place was.  Think pizza meets pub.  The host who sat us was very friendly and laid back.  We sat at a back table near the beautiful fire they cook the pizzas in.  The smell was amazing and atmosphere was exactly what we were hoping for.    The staff was very helpful in picking out beverages.  They had a great list that paired well with all the food.    We settled on the Pear and Rocket Salad to start.  For two people it was the PERFECT size!  The candied pecans paired with the pear and shaved parm made it the perfect start to the meal.   Pizza: We picked the Sweet and Spicy Snag.  The pork and fennel sausage will NOT disappoint.  Our server also brought two different olive oils for us to put on top of the pizza or dunk the crust in. THIS WAS THE BEST PART!  You have to make sure you try them.    I will share that on any normal night this would have totally been enough food for two people.  I had skipped lunch and was still hungry.  (Trust me when I get hungry I can totally eat!)   We turned to our server to help us pick something.  We told him that we loved the red sauce and wanted something with meat on it.  He said not to worry and rushed off to surprise us with exactly what we were hoping for.  I thought it was awesome he was so confident we would like it.    He brought us the El Diablo which was OUTSTANDING!  The best part is was we had about half leftover.  When we asked for a box he shared that the following morning we should heat the oven until 385 and crack an egg on the top of the pizza and have it as breakfast pizza.  We did JUST THAT and loved it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Great customer service. Nice vibe and family friendly. Our favorite pizzas are The Base, El Diablo, and The Bossco."}
{"text":"Have been here twice with friends. First time had just Moscow Mules (best ever in our options). Second time was warmly welcomed into the restaurant with a handshake and hug. We had the Caprese salad, beet salad, the special pasta (homemade!) and the meaty one pizza. All of it was so delicious and a great amount for 4 people to share. Great food and service. Will definitely be back to this local spot!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try out this new pizzeria after we saw the initial reviews were so amazing!  We stopped in one night with our dog and ate on the patio.  One of the owners was our server and he was so endearing and really guided us with our choices.  We shared a pear and rocket salad and the prawn pizza with housemade jalapeno oil - wow, that was so good!  We will definitely be back and try some additional pizzas and maybe some dessert next time."}
{"text":"I try to eat here about 2-3 times a month, at least! Their food is delicious and they offer new specials regularly. The owners staff the place and everyone makes you feel at home, which is quite amusing since they're a bunch of Aussies. They also have this hot oil that I'm kind of addicted to dipping crust into. Try it! Or maybe go for their medium heat oil, which is a great flavor, too! It's a great spot with a cute patio, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"WOW!  Friendly and outgoing and amazing! Casual and classy all at the same time. Come in shorts or suit all will feel welcome the food is outstanding and service rocks. On vacation from the ATL. We went to Yelp to find something different and it was great! We started with a mule and had breads and dips and caprese with fresh mozzarella .than we had the snag pizza was yummy ! Wish we could take back with us. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza I've ever had and I used to work at a wood fired pizza joint. The service is amazing, good drink selection (only one beer on tap, may be the only downside - the rest is bottled), and excellent salad and dessert. Highly recommend! The atmosphere is great for a classy date night or just simply for a relaxing dinner. Don't listen to any poor reviews on this place. Probably neighboring pizza places trying to steal their business."}
{"text":"Wow, Outstanding Service and Incredibly Flavored Base Pizza (tomato & basil) & Crispy Prosciutto Salad.  Did I mention the Gluten Free Crust tastes fantastic?  It does.   Highly recommend this local, family owned restaurant to anyone wanting a fun, tasty lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Spring weekends in the valley are made to take advantage of outdoor spaces before the heat rises and it becomes almost impossible to do so. Base Pizza is the perfect place if you want to be out in the air without exerting too much energy. The patio has the perfect vantage point with a straight viewing shot to the mountains. But, to add to the great patio, the menu is awesome too. Just the appetizer menu blew my mind! Weekends are also made for splurges like pizza... oh and wine! Well, for me they are! My fellow Yelpers did not do me or Base Pizza wrong with the star rating of almost five when I was here yesterday. It's truly that: a five, but really.. it' a perfect ten. We were met by the lovely, gracious, smiling Megan on this particular Saturday afternoon moving to evening. We had a choice of most the tables on the patio and it was perfect with the sun setting over the mountain. A recommendation off what we liked in vino and with Megan's expert opinion, we chose a Loire Valley bottle of Les Boursicottes Sancerre; a crisp white wine that was much like a light sauvignon blanc and perfect for this mid heated day. There is quite a list of beers here and wines have a proper selection, as well. We decided to enjoy our nice bottle and order the Ploughman's Board. Megan recommended this too.. as we said how much we loved trying different charcuterie boards in the valley and how much they vary in amount and cost. This girl knows this menu and engages her customers! This board blew our mind when it arrived! It was more of a smorgasbord platter of things from the starter menu! Olives; a bit of Caprese ; Garlic Créma ( TO die FOR!); a super creamy chunk o' Brie ; a hard fontina type cheese ( generous portions, mind you); Prosciutto; Soppressetto Salami ; a Basil Pesto dip; Pear slices with Cranberry Chutney ; strawberries; marinated artichoke hearts; Brussels and crisp bacon, soooooo good!, and garlic toasted Noble Bread .. ALL this ** $20! It's a meal in itself and the MOST amazing charcuterie board I've EVER had in AZ and maybe all over this past year! The whole thing was great and we took some of it home. We were so full of wine and this massive board we decided to order a pizza to go, as that was the main reason for coming to Base Pizza and we got sidetracked, as we often do! We decided that The Bossco was the choice to take for this day. Base Pizza pies are in average about 11-12 inches in diameter. The Bossco came with organic fresh tomatoes; pepperoni; fresh fennel and sage sausage; charred sweet onions; wood fired peppers ; olives ; and fresh parmigiana and fior de latte. This pizza was enough , with leftovers, for two. It was still fresh and so tasty when we got it home. I truly love great pizza. Base Pizza not only was great pizza, it's a great place to hang out.. catch a sunset over the mountains .. or take in the vibe at the cool bar inside. The wines and beers were on point.. service could not have been better .. the menu is supreme. I love that we are so lucky with our local foodie scene here in the valley .. add Base Pizza to the list , because it's all things local and awesome!"}
{"text":"Greater tasting food and nicer folks you'll not find elsewhere!! We had the big meat pizza and the pablova dessert - the pizza was hot and tasty and the creamy dessert, made from \"Momma's Secret Recipe\" is divine!! It has a great view of the mountain! The owner made us feel welcome, talking to us, off and on, throughout our visit. I'll definitely be going here, again."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon for a post mani/pedi late afternoon nosh, we were welcomed in by the owners who were so friendly and helpful.  We decided to split a salad and pizza, we ordered the crispy prosciutto salad and the piggy pizza, both were absolutely delicious!!!  I am a lactard so pizza isn't normally my thing but this pizza is cheeseless (it comes with some shaved parm on top, easy fix) I seriously have never felt so strongly about a pizza before it was absolutely perfect!!! I can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great place to come to enjoy some scrumptious food, fantastic service, and the oils are so good!"}
{"text":"Such a great new restaurant! The food was amazing!! So fresh and all organic. They even have organic wine."}
{"text":"I currently went for dinner with a few friends, since it was somewhere we wanted to try. The location of this pizzeria is facing Piestewa Peak, amazing view and, the décor is subtle yet hipster posh.  The wine selection is extensive, carrying excellent American wines, especially reds. We ordered quite a few pizzas: the meaty one, the chicken pesto, the sweet and spicy, and pizza of the day, which consisted of arugula, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, red onions, and their sauce. Personally, my favorite pizza was the meaty one, but I enjoyed all the other pizza. It was good, but it was missing that \"umph!\". The only off-set was that the crust got chewy and hard if you did not eat the pizza quickly, but their toppings were fresh and delicious. I did LOVE how they bring spicy olive oils to accompany your crust. Lastly, the service is excellent; we had a very attentive waiter."}
{"text":"5 Star worthy ...Absolutely \"crusted\" it!  Went with all the days specials and savored every bite. The infused oils for the pizza were fantastic. Most of all the friendly service and attention were appreciated and welcome. Well done BASE!"}
{"text":"We arrived to Base in kind of a sour mood after a very long day and a very hard week. We were ready for a good meal that we could devour in a comfortable restaurant - we found it!   Michael seated us right away and got us set up with cold water and menus. He was very kind and attentive. We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Snag and The Meaty One, both well-done (crispy).   The Sweet & Spicy was really a fun pie. The sausage was crispy and delicious, and the sweet onions gave it a real pop of flavor. Fresh chopped jalapeños were just a pinch of spice and earthiness. The Meaty One was all you need in a meat pizza, and I really loved how fresh the crushed tomato was in each slice!   Along side our pizza were infused olive oils or us to try. One was described as 7/10, and one 10/10 on a spicy scale. Neither were melt-your-face-off hot, but both had great heat and pronounced flavor.   The restaurant is comfortable and inviting, and all the waitstaff seemed to be friendly and liked working with each other - I love seeing this in a restaurant!   All in all, a great stop. We will be back. Thanks again, Michael!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza if you like crispy Roman style pizza. Nice little patio outside as well as cool setting inside.  Great wait staff and service. While I was there for lunch, one of the owners came out to say hello which was a nice touch. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Flew into town from Chicago and my brother said we had to try this place out.  Cool location first of all looking up at Camelback Mountain.  They offer indoor or outdoor seating.  Very friendly and inviting staff.  We were all greeted with hellos, how are yous, and immediately seated.  We started off with some great craft beers and wines while we looked over thier creative menu.  This is where the fun begins! We started with these amazing Bacon flavored deviled eggs, with fresh parmesan and so much more....  yum Then we had a few salads and split amungst our group.  One was a pear salad with candied nuts and fresh slice pears with a lemon vinegerette and the other salad was a shrimp pesto avacado salad.  Oh my word, but it doesn't stop there.....  For our meals we enjoyed the Meat pizza and the sweat n spicy pizzas.  All fresh ingredients, wonderful tastes, on a thin crust hamd tossed dough cooked in a pizza oven.  Lastly my brother told me to try a few of thier handcrafted olive oils.  Wow are those awesome with the pizza.  The scorpion was hot,tasty and our favorite. However, my brother and I tried the smokey ghost pepper which was also excellent.  So in a nut shell you must try this place.  They are an amzaing pizza place with thier own take on food with a twist.  Keep up the great work!  Anytime we are back visiting from the Midwest / Lake Wisconsin area we will be stopping!   Remi's Thirty Moose"}
{"text":"My first and only Yelp review.  This place is awesome!  Great pizza, apps, and beer.  Modern without being pretentious.  This will easily be one of the top 3 pizzas in the city.  Try the plough mans platter....fantastic.  Will definitely be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Do not pass go. Gome to this awesome place and have awesome pizza, awesome beer, and the staff is amazing. My wife and I feel that this is a first date place, a place for us to come on the weekend for casual food, and just an all round great pizza place. The owners are amazing. We truly enjoyed this experience and will be back for sure.  Oh my says the poached pear dessert is out of this world good"}
{"text":"Really cute place. I ordered to go but can already tell service is great! I got two pizzas. The dough is fantastic, the flavors were good ! I added a picture of my mediterranean pizza. Really good i just thought it was missing cheese... I like cheese on my pizza... Got simple cheese for lids. They wanted more cheese but that could be a kid (my kids?) thing. I would definitely go back and try it again."}
{"text":"I love this pizza but you need to know it's not traditional pizza. It's very rustic and deconstructed."}
{"text":"3.5 stars (upgrade to 4 stars if you come after 3 pm on a Tuesday when all pizzas are 50% off).  Focus is on lighter, healthier options.  Organic salads.  Pizza options are not greasy, cheesy, heavily sauced but rather are geared for more sophisticated, adult tastes.  Lightly topped with quality ingredients.  Very pleasant service.  I prefer the bar seating as the tables are pretty scrunched together in a long, narrow (though pleasant) space.  Patio looks nice but won't be of much use to anyone until about October...  But prices not cheap - we had an 'Almalfi' salad (good quality mozzarella and balsamic along with olives, shredded artichoke pieces, cucs, etc ) for about $15 - tasty but a tad pricey.  Organics cost more.  Good wine options but, like the rest of the menu, priced accordingly  (it's Paradise Valley adjacent, after all...).  The acid test for any artisanal pizza place is the crust, which here we found ordinary (chew, texture, char all a tad weak despite undoubtedly high quality flour used).  So what is left pizza-wise is basically some really nice, quality ingredients being gently placed on what tastes like a pretty ordinary base (pun!).    Come on a Tuesday and sample a few pies and see for yourself...  There is no such thing as guilt-free pizza, but the lighter, organic themed approach here only counts as one-half of a traditional pizza sin (unless you tack on a dessert, too)."}
{"text":"Very good, high quality pizza.  Spicy snag is probably my favorite.  Nice mix of spicy, sweet, and savory with the sausage.  It also has a dog friendly patio area that has a nice view of the mountains.  This is a fantastic, unique place for a date, but at the same time, family friendly enough to be a nice weeknight casual dinner.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite. Close to home too! Such a friendly greeting every time you walk in. Rossco & Karlee are so gracious and the food is to die for! We love the spicy snag pizza so much that it took a few weeks of visits to convince is to try something else. Well, we may have been a little strong armed in the most delightful way to try something new. We gave El Diablo a go this evening at Rossco's convincing and have fallen in love with Base all over again. We even got to celebrate Australia Day with this lively team. Base has become our go to place. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wow, such GREAT pizza!! Rivals Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco. Had the Base and the Diablo, both were fantastic. Also had the prosciutto salad which was great- the prosciutto was slightly crispy and tasted wonderful. Super friendly owners. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've tried almost every pizza. They're all great. The crust is nice and crunchy. The toppings are creative and flavorful. It's not overly rich and heavy. I also really like the beet and kale salad. It may not sound that exciting but it's really good. Even my husband likes it."}
{"text":"Can you say Awesome!!! What a wonderful place !  Awesome people make you feel like your part of the family! The food is amazing had the base pizza wonderful the salad and also the sauces for dipping great !!!!! We love this place."}
{"text":"My family and I are tough critics when it comes to pizza. The pizza here is hands down the best in Phoenix. Having two sisters that spent 6 months in Italy, they know what it's supposed to taste like. My family probably goes to Base once a week and the staff always treat us well and the food never disappoints.   We've tried pretty much every pizza on the menu but the white truffle has to be the winner by far. The flavors are awesome. It's the type of pizza you want to take to Vegas and marry. My mom orders it every time and the waiters never even ask her what she's having because they already know it's the white truffle. The meaty one and spicy snag are also great especially when paired with the spicy oils. Try the scorpion king one if you like spicy.   The salads are fantastic. Light, fresh, and tasty are a few words that come to mind when I indulge. Try the summer salad with the shrimp. You can thank me later.   All of the food is made with fresh ingredients and a quality you can really taste. Kudos to you, Base!"}
{"text":"Upscale option for pizza night. Very good pizza & friendly service.   We got the meat lovers option, then dessert.  Love this place.   Relaxing ambiance"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and so are the owners. Pizza is AMAZING, and fresh. Last night was our second time in and the owners remembered exactly what our drinks were from the first time. They make you feel right at home from the minute you walk in. This place will be packed in no time. One of our new faves by far!"}
{"text":"Delishhhhh. Yummy champagne! The dips and pita, the pizza, crispy prosciutto salad, and the bonnie dessert (banana bread with ice cream)....absolutely to live for. The atmosphere is lovely and the owners are fantastic. Everyone must go and indulge in some deliciousness"}
{"text":"First of all, the staff here are super friendly and hospitable and go above and beyond to make sure your experience is great. we came here for the first time last night and can't believe we didn't discover this place sooner! My husband and I shared the amalfi salad and chook pizza and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best pizzas I've ever had (and I've had pizza in Italy). We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try a new pizza place for Valentine's Day as that has been our traditional Valentine's Day Dinner Date...(locally owned pizza restaurant). In the past we have gone back to the same little place in Old Town until the food and service took a HUGE nose dive so off to a new spot we went! I pass Base Pizzeria every day on my way to work so I looked it up and loved that it is locally sourced and organic food! We made a reservation for 7pm and was seated right away. The restaurant is not huge but they have a nice patio, little bar and tables inside and you can see them making the pizza's right there in the corner next to the bar. So cute! Every Tuesday they do 1/2 off pizza's and kept the special even on Valentine's Day! They had some specials on the chalk board on the wall when you walk in and also had posted them on their Instagram page and man did they look delicious! We each ordered a pizza, my boyfriend had the Base (traditional margarita type pizza) and I had The Magpie. I LOVED my pizza and so did my boyfriend. The service was great as well! I cannot wait to make this our little pizza spot!"}
{"text":"I'm all about that Base bout that Base Pizzeria that is..... I first seen this quaint establishment on Instagram,  I follow Brie Bella & Daniel Bryan from WWE.  They're locals from Scottsdale AZ and they know all the local great farm to table eateries!  So I knew this was gonna be the bomb.com!!   Top 5 reasons to give them a try   1.  Phenomenal customer service very personable and genuinely friendly to my son & myself.     2. They use as much local & organic ingredients as possible.  Farm to table is totally in ! They even have an awesome custom dining table that was made in AZ.  They carry Local wines & the EVOO they have is infused with LOCAL hot peppers as well.    3. They make the dressings & pizza sauce from scratch !   4. Cleanliness was superb, both dining area & restrooms.    5.  Pizza & Salad was delicious ! Two thumbs up The pizza was fresh made to order & the aroma was enticing !  Watching it go in the coal burning oven is mouthwatering.   I ordered the crispy prosciutto salad, it was loaded with arugula, crispy prosciutto, goat cheese & avocado it was delicious !! Very fresh and filling, enough for two ! I had most definitely had enough for lunch the next day !   The pizza we ordered was half cheese half pepperoni, just the right size !! Not to big not to small just right!!!  I believe 6 slices total. The pepperoni was big & fresh.  The texture was soft and not to chewy. It's free from preservatives so has a distinctively different taste & texture than run of the mill Pizza's.  I loved it & so did my little so , we gotta give it a solid 8!! it would have rated it a 10 but it was a tad on the soggy side. However It was bursting with such fabulous flavor that I didn't mind, maybe a little longer in the oven to get that crunch and less sogginess.  So next time I'll just ask for a little extra cook time.    Overall they rock !!! I'll totally be back & rave about them to anyone looking for a good pie in the area   Enjoy !!!"}
{"text":"Always searching for the best pizza opportunities in Phoenix. This place has some good pizza. What really surprised me was the Ploughman Platter which was awesome! Great bread, meats, cheeses, and nuts. This platter alone made the entire dining experience worth the trip. If you like butcher boards make sure you give this one a shot. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and I never get desserts at restaurants except for Base!! Love, love, love the Australian dessert they make! As always service is spot on. Love the family feel this place gives and glad to call it our neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved their pizza, their decoration, and nice Australian owner.  This place came up on Yelp search and didn't even know it was here although I drove by everytime I go hiking to the piestewa peak.  This place is only 11 mins drive from the Camelback mountain, makes a perfect stop after hiking.  As soon as I walked in, a nice lady with Australian accent welcomed me. I really like the decor of the restaurant, very inviting. I saw the wine list and really wanted to order a glass of wine. Their ambiance is perfect to enjoy a glass of wine or beer. If I didn't have to work later, I would definitely have ordered one.  Perhaps next time..  I ordered the Mediterranean pizza. Pizza came with tomato, mushroom, artichoke, olives and Parmesan. All my favorite pizza ingredients.  Their olives tasted like home made olives.   Server spoke with Australian accent too but I think he was just playing along. Great service nonetheless. I liked the bathroom decoration too. Lot of thoughtfulness throughout.  I can't wait to come back and try some other pizza and other dish on the menu (with a glass of wine)."}
{"text":"Great pizza, yummy fresh salads, fun daily specials, and a roomy patio with gorgeous views make Base Pizzeria an easy and reliable option. Owner is on site, charming and accommodating. They bring fresh ice water in a dog bowl when we bring our favorite furry family member. Never disappointing; however, if you're rushing, maybe go someplace that is more willing to rush your food out...come to spend some time with your party, while waiting for the delicious fare to be served at this local and charming restaurant."}
{"text":"The BASE has some of the best Pizza. Especially the Veggie, it is so tasty with all of the veggies. The desserts which are made from scratch are so good!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today and had such a good experience. I ordered a gluten free pizza and it was not put in correctly. Not only did they quickly fix it but they also gave me a refund for the inconvenience. It's so rare to find good customer service like this and match it with great food! Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"This place is great on a Monday or a Tuesday when they are running specials. Otherwise, I think it can be a little pricey, but all of the food is organic, and I believe mostly, if not all, is locally grown/harvested. If you're adamant about organic or local food, then you probably don't mind the up-charge, in which case you're going to love this place any day of the week.   Monday evening gets you something like a charcuterie board and a bottle of wine for $20 or $25. On Tuesdays after 3pm (the best deal), all their pizzas are half price. They are great pizzas. My girlfriend and I got two and ate a little more than half of each so there was plenty to take home. Drinks are a little expensive so be mindful - most glasses of wine were around $12/glass.  Service was lovely. We had one of the owners wait on us (it's a brother and sister as well as her husband). We had the lady and she was spectacular. I would recommend anyone to try this place."}
{"text":"So we started at Federal Pizza that was closed (assuming it was a staff party bc all the other Upward spots were closed).  I remembered we wanted to try Base and I'm SO glad I did!  Unbelievable pizza!  So fresh and clean.  Since I've  never been, I gotta believe this has to be what pizza tastes like in the Old Country!! It was an unbelievable meal for our sons 16th birthday!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always awesome, friendly group of owners and staff around. They take great pride in what they do and it shows o. The plate and in the glass."}
{"text":"Very exceptional pizza with very exceptional (I assume owners) ((with authentic Australian accents)). Along with the views outside overlooking the mountain. This is a very nice quaint atmosphere. Very warming inside with a nice patio outside as well. The sauce on these pizzas are absolutely amazing. Honestly I have had pizza all around the world and this is one of the best pizzerias I have ever been to! Well Done gents and hats off to you guys."}
{"text":"I'm always very skeptical of 5-star reputations on Yelp, but oh Yelpers, you are rarely wrong.   We ordered two pizzas to go, which I really don't recommend for artisan pizza. The crust gets soggy. But boyfriend doesn't like eating in public. So, you know, we compromise.  Anyway, highly recommend the spicy snag. Remember those tombstone pizzas your dad used to make when mom was out with the girls? It's like the grown up version of that. Fancy sausage. Spicy, with a hint of sweetness. The fresh chile adds a nice contrast in texture. Sad to admit I ate the leftovers for breakfast (no cheat days here)."}
{"text":"Drove by today after I got off work. Place looked really nice on the outside. A very nice gentlemen by the name Andrew helped us out.  He made us feel welcomed. We Ordered a pizza and the wait time was very reasonable. It was a pizza that Andrew suggested to us since it was our first time there and the pizza was amazing. Very delicious food and the service was great. Trust me people you won't regret it. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza especially if you're vegan or have a Vegan in your group! They have Diaya Vegan cheese or will do just about any dish without cheese if you ask. The classic bruschetta is amazing and the veggie pizza without cheese is to die for! I would recommend adding extra toppings though. Definitely use the infused olive oil's if you like heat"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get pizza since moving to Phoenix...We came to this conclusion after trying a bunch of others.  A Piggy and Pinot makes for a good day!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place - haven't been disappointed yet. Great owners, servers and atmosphere and food that doesn't disappoint. Happy hour setting has an awesome view of Squaw Peak, though I hate to broadcast that because I want to be sure I have a seat. The pizza, salads and wine list won't disappoint - a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I love local businesses it hurts to give them an A-OK rating.  Service in the beginning was good when they were not swamp.  We waited for the rest of the party to arrive and when they got busy, it was tough to get the attention.  I had to ask for a refill several times.  And with the first group of friends walked in, she forgot my order.  I was trying to wave her down.  So I figure I will just order with the 2nd wave of friends.  I did and of course my order came out last.  But we did place an order in for more pita bread for our humus.  That took forever to get out.  I believe it is the size of our group (14) plus the place was busy.    The humus and pita bread was great!  The base pizza with prosciutto was delicious.  Yes, I have been here before, hopefully it was a one time bad experience for me."}
{"text":"Wow..how attitudes have changed! We were so looking forward to enjoying a pizza and seeing the owner, but were not impressed with his arrogant attitude when we walked in. We were told we could have a table by the hostess, as there were 5 open ones, and only one with a reservation sign on it. Instead, the owner walked over and told us we could only have the bench seating that was jammed next to the wall. Hardly enough room to fit between the table next to it. We told him the girl said we could have one of the tables and he immediately said that he had just had a reservation for it, and every table was spoken for. Really? At 7:00 on a Tuesday? Funny, he never even recognized us as regular customers who rooted him on when he started. So, with that, we left and walked to the other end of the shopping center and went to Amore. It was superb!! When we finished, we walked back to where our car was parked, and sure enough, all the tables that were supposedly reserved were still unused, and the place was empty. I guess the owner was counting on making people that might show up, happier than the ones that actually took the time to come in. With so many good places in town, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great new pizzeria! Breathing life into what used to be a stuffy, overpriced restaurant, Base pizzeria is refreshingly down to earth. A family run business, consisting of a quartet of hilarious Aussies (brother and sister duo of Roscoe and Carly are most visible), the staff are friendly, funny, and genuinely passionate about their food. They take obvious pride in their locally sourced, organic ingredients and are not shy about offering a taste of this and that.  You feel as though you just stopped in to share a meal with your own family---right down to Roscoe teasing Hubs about not finishing the last bite of proscuitto, which drew quite a laugh from our table after he mowed down practically an entire cutting board of Charcuterie.  We had the Charcuterie (very impressive amount of food, bread was amazing and the meats and cheese were tasty and filling), the 'Base' pizza (picky Hubs even ate the crust, a first), and the Crispy Proscuitto Salad---deliciousness. The tomatoes used on the pizza are second to none and the brick oven adds that smoky, delicious flavor.  Tasty, fresh food, warm and welcoming staff, and easy to get in and out of this location. Superb addition to local lineup and pleased to support a true neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. If the food wasn't great enough, the ownership of this establishment is second to none. They greet every person who walks through the door and strives to make a person connection with them all. Roscoe is a gem and I can't wait until everyone in Phoenix experiences this place. We will definitely be back... Soon"}
{"text":"Let me first  say, I've visited  Base several months ago, it was good. It was a rainy day and they weren't busy. My hubby loves pizza and I wanted him to experience Base. I understand it is owned by the same people that own  SMITH'S, we love it there! We tried to go today. It was about 6:30, there were a few tables not occupied, one a 6 top (I did not notice a reserved sign) and another table  that was smaller. The gentlemen walked up, didn't ask me _ I volunteered there would be only two for dinner. He said we'd \"have to wait 30 minutes or sit outside\". He wasn't really rude, he was more of a \"take it or leave it\" type tone/attitude. Didnt really seem concerned that we weren't waiting 30 minutes for pizza and we weren't going sit outside in 108 degrees. We left. I'm disappointed and to be honest, it's not WHAT he said, its HOW he said it, with really no kindness. I don't know what's up with that.  We ended up at Cherry Blossom where they were really friendly and we received excellent service"}
{"text":"I'm glad I am the second review because my wife and I were the second customers yesterday for lunch for the opening.   What a great place to eat!  The owners are amazing and have a great story. Everything is locally grown, fresh and organic.   We look forward to our second visit."}
{"text":"Wow this place just opened and I feel so lucky to have been in town! I forgot her name but the tall red headed lady was very nice and told us that all the food is locally sourced and organic! The pizza was delicious and I added artichokes (artichokes are my fav).  The pear and rocket salad was delicious and tasted like it was straight off the farm."}
{"text":"I agree with all the other reviews - five stars! Seriously, as good as it gets! This restaurant was a nice relief when I walked up and found a cool, relaxing, friendly and yet classy pizza restaurant in the plaza of 32nd St and Lincoln. The service and the food equal out - impeccable!   Hubby ordered a beer, we ordered the bruschetta, the meaty one pizza (gluten free) and the tiramisu. I liked the bruschetta. We haven't found a good gluten free pizza in a long time until the night we dined here. Although I did think the pizza was a little small, it was delicious and we wished we had more!   For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu with the recommendation of an employee and when we received it, it was bigger than what we anticipated. It was delectable and I loved every bite. I highly recommend ordering the tiramisu if you visit. Since it was so big, we had leftovers and took it home. We ate it the next day and it was still just as good as the other night.   Price is a little higher than other pizza joints around the valley, but I enjoyed the dining experience. Total of our bill: $53. Overall, this restaurant is a great addition to the valley and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place! The pizza is good and the owners are extremely nice! Thy are also very accommodating for children (although I wouldn't say it is the best place to bring kids from a parent perspective...depending on how loud your kiddos are....) The only negative (which is the only reason I gave it four stars) is that I think their wine list is over priced for what it is. Overall, we will keep going!"}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to Base. Everything on the menu is amazing and the service is too notch. Megan the waitress is way awesome!  The view is great too!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Base from the moment I walked in. One of the owners promptly greeted me when I walked in and took me to the table while I waited for my friend.   The same man was also our server and went above and beyond the entire evening to take care of us.   We were there on a Tuesday night which happened to be half price pizza night. Nice surprise!   To start, we ordered the meat and cheese board, called the Ploughman Platter. It was huge and absolutely delicious. Nice selection of meats, cheeses, fruit, nuts, olives, hummus and bread.   For the main course we of course ordered pizzas. We shared two, the El Diablo and the Spicy Snag. El Diablo was a soppressata and kalamata olive pizza. Spicy Snag is a sausage and caramelized onion pizza. Both were very good but the Spicy Snag won between the two. Pizzas are big enough to share but we each polished one off.   We were too stuffed for dessert, but they had some great looking treats available. I'll have to try one next time.   Be sure to check this place out. Support those local businesses! I can't express enough how great the service was.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp! Was a little skeptical at first. Mostly 5 stars?! Happens very rarely specialty with so many reviews. Had to try this place. Upon arrival we were greeted by a very courteous young lady by the name of Megan. She brings a new meaning to a good service with a smile! The evening only got better as the food started arriving! Wow you do have to also try their jalapeño olive oil!! Yes BASE earned its great reputation on Yelp"}
{"text":"They have The Prisoner by the glass. Need I say more?! Great pizza, love the hummus. The owners are funny Aussies. We're definitely adding this restaurant to our neighborhood rotation."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with creative specials - they had a Reuben Pizza the night we were there - amazing!  SUPER friendly service and top notch ingredients - Loved It!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Such fantastic flavors and the owners obviously have a passion about sharing those flavors! Absolutely loved the flatbread with dips. Pizzas were to die for and ended up purchasing a bottle of the Base made Scorpion oil to use at our home. A fantastic experience and amazing food! Thanks Base!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are just classic and delicious and you can't ever go wrong. They have a better than average wine selection. The service was also very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"I've now eaten here 4x and each time it's like a new experience. Food is fantastic, fresh, Organic, clean. I'm big on nutrition and juice daily so it's hard to find a restaurant that delivers a clean menu by that I mean GMO/ chemical free. I could count on one hand the restaurant that fall into that category. The staff is very friendly and engaged to you have a wonderful dining out experience. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped into Base after checking out of a nearby resort a few weeks ago.  Great little patio!  Something I thought was nice is that since the whole front of the restaurant is glass, so you get a beautiful view of the mountains no matter where you're sitting    We split the Ploughman's Platter and The Bossco Pizza.  I love rare meats and cheeses and The Ploughman's was probably one of the best charcuterie boards I've ever had.  It was HUGE and well worth the price with a great selection of meats, cheeses and accouterments.  Highly recommend.    The Bossco Pizza was also great.  I don't know what made them think of \"pepperoni cups\", but it was a pretty solid idea.  Seriously, they're shaped like little cups, and they take up less surface area on the pizza.  So, like, there's more pepperoni fit into the same space.  More pepperoni = more awesome!  This and the pizza's other ingredients - organic crushed tomato, pork & fennel sausage, wood-fired peppers, charred onion, kalamata olives, fior di latte and oregano - just really made for a delightful pizza with a nicely finished crust.      Our service was also impeccable.   I wish I could remember our server's name as well as I remember the food because she was awesome.  Super friendly, super attentive and she had great recommendations.    Great pizza in a beautiful part of town."}
{"text":"Went to Base for the first time last night and I have to agree with all the 5-star reviews - this place is awesome.  We sat out on the patio and I have to say their patio chairs were super comfy! It's a quiet shopping center so it was a pretty chill atmosphere.  We started with the pear and rocket salad - delicious! Fresh pears, arugula, candied pecans and just the right amount of dressing. It was a pretty big salad and we ate it all!  Next up we ordered 2 pizzas, although 2 people could easily get away with one and an app or salad. But we wanted leftovers so we got the Roni and the base with sausage added. They were fairly simple pizzas as far as ingredients but they were far from simple when it came to flavor.  Their pepperoni is some of the best I've ever had and the sausage was just right - not spicy, but very tasty. And the crust was done just right too - not burned or tasteless - really good. I can't really say which was better - they were both great.  Plus, I love that they use organic ingredients!   No doubt we will be returning to try more of their pizzas. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owners. They made it a very pleasant experience that matched the food quality. Nearly everything is organic and we enjoyed everything. We split a salad, corn chowder, pizza, desert and coffee. We did not arrive until 30 minutes before closing and I only realized after we left that it was 30 minutes past closing time. They did not rush us at all. We will be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Hey! It's National Pizza and Bagel Day!  What does Base Pizza have up its sleeve for that!!  Boom!  They did it again!  Dad and daughters out for the night and we end up with a tic tac toe and hang man game night at the table!  Roscoe and the family make his an amazingly easy place to want to have a great dinner!  Bruschetta was ridiculously good!  Pizza even better!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love! I go here at least once a week and I am never disappointed. The food is outstanding. The service is top notch and the view on the patio is so calm and beautiful! Try the Base pizza and the bruschetta. This place is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Too hard to explain how awesome this place is. Warm staff, great food, superb beer/wine selection."}
{"text":"Amazing service, super kind friendly ( awesome green Sippy cups and coloring), incredible pizza especially the white truffle mushroom. We are visiting Phoenix and will definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Base on a whim on a random Thursday night in 2015 and expected nothing beyond a generic pizza experience. In the end, we were pleasantly surprised and have since put Base into regular rotation when dining out.  What immediately grabbed our attention is the friendliness of the Australian staff that run Base. While servers in most restaurants seem to be running on auto-pilot, the people we spoke to were extremely pleasant and genuinely seemed very enthusiastic about the food they're providing. They focus very heavily on using local sourcing and strongly emphasizing the organic aspects of their food.  We've been here many times. We typically start with their toasted bread, which definitely doesn't disappoint. They told me their source and I forget the exact name, but they clearly chose very wisely. Additionally, they offer a meat/cheese board referred to as as the Ploughman Platter. I can confidently say that it puts practically all other charcuterie boards to complete shame!  For pizza recommendations, there's the The Base (margherita) and The Piggy, which features the ever-so-popular prosciutto and parmesan combination. We've also ordered the El Diablo, which features some spicy soppressata with olives and The Chook, which includes organic chicken thigh and potato. However, our usual orders consist of the Meaty One and the Magpie - but it's really just about personal preference. All of their pizzas use ingredients that are very high quality. I really like that they have a variety of spice-infused olive oils available at varying levels of intensity. Over time, I feel their pizza has shown some improvements in crust quality - which is probably why we keep coming back on a regular basis.  Their desserts are tricky. The ones that we loved, including an incredible banana-nutella pizza and affogato are no longer on the menu. They do have some respectable options out there, but they're a bit on the pricier side, so we only order them on occasion.   On the positive, the people are some of the nicest restaurant owners you'll encounter.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The reviews are true. This place is as good as it gets.  We have been to Base twice. The atmosphere is comfortable, yet classy. The service is extremely warm and friendly. They treat you like family.  The food is ridiculously good. Last time we went, we ordered a Caesar salad to share as a starter. They take great care and thought into each component of the dish. The produce was extremely fresh and tasty. The dressing was delicious. Even the croutons were unique and homemade with a delicious, slightly spicy flavor.  The pizzas... I was trying to figure out what their crust reminds me of and then it hit me. It is very similar to Indian naan bread, which is one of my favorite breads ever. It is outrageously good. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. So much better than Pizzeria Bianco's overly cooked crust! And without the snotty attitudes of Pizzeria Bianco's staff! The best crust I have had in Phoenix. The toppings are high quality ingredients and make for a very tasty pizza. Try them with their chili oils! You won't regret it.  The food is a little pricey but worth it. Especially when you have chains rolling out food for the same price but crappy quality. I recommend going Tuesday nights when pizzas are half-off."}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in Arizona! We have a winner ladies and gentlemen!!  So, I knew about Base for some time now and really wanted to check it out. Finally the fates allowed and last week was my 1st taste of this often copied but never successfully executed pizza concept.  All the other pizzas I have had like this had 1 major flaw. The center crust (midlle of the pie) was always soggy, didn't hold up well if you like toppings and forget about reheating to a crispy state...Base won 2 of these categories...really? Only 2? Why?   1. No part of this delicious homemade crust resembles anything you'd call soggy...as a result  2. The crust holds up extraordinarily well even with a lot of toppings!  3. Reheat well? You kidding me? Like there's a chance I would leave a morsel behind! May never get a chance to test that feature out ;-)   Our server was amazing, funny and felt like an old friend.  Location - at the base of some beautiful Phoenix mountains (FYI Base pizzeria was named before this site was chosen.  The owners from Australia think base ingredients make up a truly great pizza)   $$$$ HALF OFF TUESDAY AFTER 3 PM - see website for exact details$$$$  5+ stars! Yelp should consider a 10 star system as this was truly remarkable and well worthy of its many accolades!"}
{"text":"After reading so many positive Yelp reviews about Base Pizzeria, I had to go check it out for myself.  Well fellow Yelpers....you led me in the right direction :)  This place rocks.  Everything about this place is on point.  From the service to the food, I couldn't find a flaw anywhere.    To start, service was just outstanding.  Our server was one of the owners, Roscoe, and he was super friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about their food.  He described all their specials of the day (quick note: all food is sourced our local farms) and we had to try their specialty pizza of the day (roasted corn sauce with sausage and aoili on top).  The crust on this pizza is heavenly, and every bite was worth mile I had to run the next day to burn off the calories.    The atmosphere itself is relaxed, casual and homey.  We sat outside, and they have blankets set up at every table in case you get a case of the chills.  Luckily for us, it was perfect outside, so the blanket wasn't needed, but it's a lovely extra touch that shows you that they care about their customers.  If you're looking for fresh comfort food with lovely people, I 100% recommend checking out Base Pizzeria!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great wood fired pizza? This place has it all! Fresh, local, ingredients in an inventive menu, excellent ambiance, great service and at a good value. Does that all still exist?? Loved the outdoor seating the the springtime. They have throws and heat lamps if it gets chilly. Try the charcuterie board and anything they have on special!"}
{"text":"service and great relaxed atmosphere. I loved the pizza . The starter salad was a little bland but had a nice flavor. Our server was fun engaging and recommended a great wine. We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in Phoenix & my husband found Base randomly online. He chose it based on the ratings. I'm so glad he did! We took our 2 year old daughter with us for lunch & had a fabulous meal! They were very accommodating with our 2 year old & just so nice. The food was also delicious! We ordered the beet & kale salad, bruschetta & 2 pizzas. My favorites were the salad & brushetta-YUM! I highly recommend Base! We will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"Wow. Everything was excellent. The pizza was cooked perfectly and clearly was made with quality ingredients.  The rocket and pear salad was also delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New local pizzeria with a fresh flavorful style. We tried a gluten-free Mediterranean pizza, bruschetta, and the pear & rocket (arugula) salad. Washed down with with a delicious iced tea infusion and an Aussie Coopers larger. The friendly staff were helpful with suggestions and tasty extra options (ask about the oils). The mainly organic produce is sourced locally and all tasted wonderful. We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner. We don't seek out organic or locally sourced food. Often think that =s overpriced and trendy but we were blown away. WHITE TRUFFLE PIZZA IS DEVINE. as is the bruschetta. Rustic just right crunchy chewy bread topped with amazingly fresh basil and tomatoes. We could have made a meal from this alone. It was a special occasion so on we went to dessert. Tiarmasu was the best I have had! Simple clean. Not soggy. I only wish we got our servers name as she was wonderful. This will be our new go to for a special night.     What an amazing night. I said BASE would be our new splurge. Our Anniversary was upon us and there was no where else I wanted to go. It's cooler now and the patio is spectacular. We had asked to reserve a patio table but were told they don't do that. We arrived early in hopes we would get seated on patio. They had flagged it and had specially reserved it for us.  The attentive details and wonderful suggestions continued at each course. Every time we have been there we end up talking to the table next to ours and find out that they too are fans. We love this place and tell everyone we can. We were humbled by the extra special personal attention. Please try this lovely spot these days customer service is so rare and they have been spot on each time we have visited."}
{"text":"Nice place - we stopped in for an early dinner on our way to an event and had a good meal."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food!  Super quality food at a great price.  Favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  The poached pear dessert is amazing!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place. Friendly and attentive. Salads are fab and pizza was too. Love the Coopers beers. Salads are enough for two, so keep this in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"We were there for an early dinner. We split the beet salad, which was definitely big enough to share and was really delicious. I ordered special Spanish Summer pizza, my husband had one of the meat pizzas - I can't recall the name. Both were excellent, and large enough that we'll have them for lunch tomorrow. They have a good selection of beers, ciders, and wines. All in all a great dinner!"}
{"text":"First off before we even talk about the pizza, let's talk about the staff. These folks from Australia are not only hilarious but they are super super kind and helpful. I would say it's the best experience I've ever had with a waiter/waitress. The pizza, the bread, The salad, everything... Is among the best food in the state of Arizona. It was just a great evening, what else can I say. It is worth your time to at least go check it out. As a lover of Joe's pizza in the village in New York city, this is just about as close as I could find in the valley that I has that same kind of magic, although the two types of pizza are a little different for sure, but both make me very happy."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome service. And..... Killer ice tea you can even get half carafes But seriously great experience please come support businesses like this here in phoenix we need them to thrive especially in summer"}
{"text":"Nice place with Mountain View. Caprese was solid and meat lovers pizza was perfect to follow. Grab a glass of wine and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza place served up by 3 Australians and an American! White Truffle pizza with a Napa Smith make for a great dinner :)"}
{"text":"Happiness - 5/5 Deliciousness - 4/5  This is a real fun place to eat. The owners are Australian and really friendly and welcoming. The oven is the centerpiece of this restaurant and you can watch them make and bake the pizzas fresh.   The bartenders are always incredible. My wife and I always ask the bartenders to make improvised drinks. We tell them the liquors we like and we get something unique and delicious every time (about $12-14/drink).   The pizza is excellent thin-crust style. They always manage to have just the right amount of char on the crust. They have numerous olive oils that you can dip your pizza or bread you order into. The fresh baked bread is also excellent.  The only reason it misses a perfect 5 is the price (very expensive - two pizzas, two drinks, bread and olives ran about $70. And the pizzas definitely feed only two people). Also, no kids menu, which makes things a bit difficult for us parents! If it were less expensive, we'd go way more often.  But as is, it's a great special occasion place."}
{"text":"Great place and friendly staff. I enjoyed the Moscow mule. Pizza was great! You Defiantly have to try the Nutella pizza for dessert. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great new pizza joint! Friendly owners! The dips are made daily and have tasted fresh and health both times we've had it! For beer I was happy with the Sam Smiths lager, and I believe they rotate a little! Any pizza will do in the wood fired oven!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite \"fancy\" pizza place in Phoenix. Yes, it surpasses Pizzeria Bianco, Parlor, Pomo, etc. because everything I've had here has been beautifully simple and amazingly delicious. Everything tastes fresh and I've loved everything I've ever tried here. Plus, every time I look at the menu, I think to myself I would eat every single on the menu. This is THE BEST pizza place in the valley because everything is fresh, simple, and amazing. The service is always wonderful too! Everyone is so friendly. It's quickly become a favorite of mine. Highly recommend!! Seriously, go here!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.  We went on a Monday night and didn't get to meet Carly, though her Aussie brother was charming.  The pizza and salads were as good as others have reported.  The selection of wines by the glass is excellent and the pours are generous. Even the $8 Malbec was very good for the price.  My wife enjoyed the Aussie Shiraz at $11. Our friends chose the salad with the chocolate flavored olive oil - that's something very different...."}
{"text":"Oh mah gaawwwwwd, best vegan pizza ever! The only problem is....I should have ordered like 3 :) The people are so nice and the food is soooo good. I'm a huge fan. Also, vegans: they use daiya, soooo obviously they know what's up. Just a little piece of constructive feedback, when ordering I think you guys should offer an extra cheese option to your vegans, although I will say, my girlfriend thought you nailed it on the cheesyness, but I could have used a little extra. Okay, that's all, thanks for being amazing!"}
{"text":"Pizza very good. Wood fired-need I say more? Friendly service, very clean. A little on the pricey side. 12\" pie w/cheese $12.00, feeds about one hungry individual."}
{"text":"Soild pizza and a friendly owner (he is a real top bloke from Australia, probably because he spent some time in Michigan) make this a good spot for pie.  Like most of Phoenix, the pizza is of the thinner variety.  However, the location is the best feature of Base Pizzeria.  It offers an excellent view of the mountains.  We loved the patio.  A nice touch was they blankets on the back of the chairs, which I utilized during a chilly lunch.  Oh, and try the Australian Coopers Brewery beers they offer.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was one of the better places I have been to food 5 atmosphere 4 parking 5 service 4 value 5  I gave them 5 stars since the food was very good and so was the value."}
{"text":"I am writing the review based on a customer service issue, not the food.  I visited Base with a group of 7-8 friends. I ordered $18 in food, a $52 bottle of wine for the table and my boyfriend got a $16 tequila.  Since I was only staying for a short time, I asked for a separate bill.  I paid the bill and left.   60 days later I was entering receipts into Quickbooks and noticed that a 20% \"service fee\" was added to the bill.  However, the waiter never told me this so, I tipped an extra 22% on top of the total, which already included the 20% fee.  To put this in dollar and cents....  $86 - bill $7.14 - tax $17.20 - 20% service charge added by waiter  $25 - tip from me  So, this waiter received $42.20 in tip on a $86 bill ($52 of which was a bottle of wine). Nice tip!  Here is the real complaint.... I called the manager and informed her of the issue.  After speaking to the server, the manager called me back.  She told me the waiter recalled the group but didn't recall if he told me specifically that the service fee was already added.  She stated it was however printed on the bill.  The manager asked me what I wanted to resolve the issue. I told her I'd like the $25 back. She then told me she'd like to resolve the issue by me coming in and getting the money directly from the server!!!  I actually laughed and told her that I wasn't going to come in and collect the money directly from the server.  The manager then told me they are a small family business and since it was tip money that the business didn't receive, she wasn't going to take it out of their own pocket.    At that point I told the manager to forget it and to please inform her servers to tell customers when gratuity is added.  I also told her that although I live in the neighborhood and dine out daily, I would never be back to Base.   What an awful way to handle this matter!  We shall see how long this place lasts!"}
{"text":"Checked out this pizzeria recently. It had a very cool vibe. The owners were actually waiting tables and interacting with guests....very pleasant atmosphere! We ordered two pizzas...(1) goat cheese, arugula and caramelized onions and (2) sausage, caramelized onions, crushed tomatoes and green chilies. Both were flavorful, but perhaps with slightly too thin of a crust. We finished with an Australian desert Pavlova, which was cream/meringue based with fruit and a raspberry glaze. It was a great light, summer desert.  But holy cow, we were charged $14 for one slice of this dessert!!!! That seemed extremely overpriced!!!! Guess we won't order from a verbal dessert list again!"}
{"text":"The waitress was wonderful and chef Michaels put out amazing food. The platter was out of this world. Place has a really nice calm setting. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? In house infused flavored oils for us spice lovers, yoga blankets during the cooler months if you want to dine outside, and the aussie owners are great with all the patrons. Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by this place! Base was the perfect mix of a romantic-relaxed dinner place. The pizza felt fresh, light, and very clean. There isn't a huge amount of cheese and little to no grease. We got the meaty pizza and was very pleased. The service was also excellent... Oh and then wine and champaign (can't forgot that). This place made me crave Italy! Super excited to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this pizzeria and definitely think it deserves 4.5 stars!! The ambiance was really cute both inside and on the patio. We sat on the patio and had a decent view of the valley, and our chairs even had blankets to make it extra cozy! The wood fired magherita pizza was great!!!"}
{"text":"Wow - What can I say. Great food and service. The Gluten Free pizza is the best in Phoenix. Add some sausage to the shrimp pizza for a surf and turf pie. They are also making a bunch of Hot Chile oils and the Pavuvu oil (A South Pacific Pepper) is tops. It is all about the Base!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was super cool. Sit outside and enjoy the piestewa mountains and sunset. Truly amazing organic wood fired pizza. Super tasty."}
{"text":"They do not wear gloves.  They have people smoke outside, when it is against law.They have dogs outside sitting by tables.  Will not ever go back.  This review is true, correct the problem"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the friendly service, unique wine choices (from owners home country of Australia!), and lovely organic, fresh, ingredients on their bruschetta (tender and yet crispy bread with tons of toppings!), summer salad, and El Diablo and Base pizzas.  Since it's just down the road from our house we feel like it's going to a friend's place for a casual and cool bite to eat.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great wood fire pizza.  The salads are good and the pizza is great.  They also have surprisingly good ice tea!"}
{"text":"Always a great time & the food is yummy. The owners are personable & service is consistent. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. Organic and local  ingredients with wonderful owners who make you feel at home. So far we have really enjoyed all the pizzas we have tried. The guten free pizza our daughter loved. The owners really understand customer service. We also enjoyed the wine list. We will back for happy hour."}
{"text":"So one day after a meeting, my subordinate and I scrambled to find a place for a quick lunch before heading to our next meeting.  And we found this exciting little organic pizza place, Base Pizzeria.     The heavens were with us that day, for it was Tuesday and the pizzas was 50% off.  The pizzas are a pretty penny so the 50% off really came in handy.  The restaurant was clean, and well kept, and the service was fast and friendly, probably due to us being the only ones there at that time.  The pizza was absolutely amazing.  We only got their base, pretty much a cheese pizza with some green things on it.  We only wanted to test out the quality of the pizza and the best way to test is by ordering a plain cheese pizza.  That way you can focus on the tomato sauce and the cheese.  The tomato sauce on it was amazing and organic, you can really taste the flavour of tomatoes.  And the cheese was strong and perfect.    Overall a great pizza!  Overall a great experience, we will definitely be back, only if it was a lot closer."}
{"text":"At Base Pizzeria what you will feel is simple - local, organic and a sense of community. Walking in the door you instantly get a feeling of being part of the family and as if you are hanging out with friends and the locals. The added bonus is the organic pizza is some of the best Phoenix has to offer."}
{"text":"First, the service was outstanding because they were so friendly! The food was so delicious. Really good and fresh ingredients. My favorite pizza was the white truffle and I also loved the amalfi salad"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back everything is great from the hostess, waiter, even the chef!  The pizzas we are having are ABSOLUTELY delicious, finally we found our pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference and wanted some good pizza.  Well, we found it alright. Incredible pizza, sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! All organic!! Scrumptious food, good wines, excellent service from the Australian owners themselves. Lovely ambiance inside or on the patio. Every friend I've brought here has loved it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Who has the true Aussie accent?  You decide! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIcOh-3-y5c   Yuko and I are on a roll!  After descending Camelback today around 4pm, we decided on pizza.  Base Pizzeria stands out because they hold a solid 5 STAR RATING!!!  After getting the full experience, I now understand why.  It's in a strip mall, so I wasnt thinking much as I walked into what turned out to be a pretty fancy dining room, especially for a pizza place.  White linen tablecloths with crystal clear wine glasses ready for the filling.  Some people know I'm a sucker for an Aussie accent, and they had me at Hello... literally... by the voice on the other end, when I called up to see if they were open on Christmas Eve.  The same charming wonder from down under, led us to our table and offered up some recommendations.  Breaking tradition, I ordered a Cooper's Pale Ale from the Motherland, or is it Fatherland? ...Underland???  Anyways, it was a perfect unfiltered beer with a refreshing taste, to this trail weary hiker.  I went with the meaty pizza, while Yuko chose the Mediterranean.  We made a secret pact to share slices... which turned out to only be one slice after she announced that her's was better.  Okay, I guess I'll just hold the monopoly on pizzas with fennel seeds.  The bottom line is:  COME HERE!  It's close to Camelback, and closer to Squaw Peak (Piestewa).  Take a train, trolley, cab, Uber, Lyft, hang glider, pogo stick... whatever.  Just come here.  The owners are super personable, really upbeat with a great energy, and just plain happy to have you there.  I recorded a 43 second video with the owner, that Yelp isnt allowing me to upload.  Dont make me send Crocodile Dundee up there to handle things.  Get your tech together, Yelp!"}
{"text":"Wow! Tried this place out last week-what a great little place for pizzas and salads! Had the base pizza and the sausage pizza with caramelized onions, and the pear and candied walnut salad. Very tasty and fresh! They also have a really great cider too.  The owners are super nice Aussies.  We will definitely be back. We love supporting our small business owners! Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Aussie owners?! Yessss it is. Her name is Carly, her, her husband and her brother open the Base for 3 months now. She's super cute. Geez her accent, her energy is great and super friendly! The restaurant has such a good vibe to it. Nice patio and great layout.  I absolutely love this place. Holy cow my mushroom truffle pizza was amazing. Especially with the ghost oil sauce. I took off the lid to taste the chili. Two thumbs up!   I shall be back :D"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We are from San Diego and have traveled and had pizza around the world and this spectacular family run place is in the running to be one of our favorites!!! Carly and Rossco are fabulous! So fun, personable, and downright adorable!!! We are so thrilled we stumbled on this gem!!! We would highly recommend this cute place! Even our kids were fighting over who would finish the last piece!!!!"}
{"text":"Found Base on Yelp and had to try it.  We ordered 2 Base pizzas and a salad to go and brought it back to our hotel.  The service was amazing and super friendly.  Love the Australian accents!  The pizza was awesome and our two boys loved it.  The crispy prosciutto was also amazing!!!! Fresh and enjoyable but not heavy feeling.  Will definitely go back.  The restaurant itself has a super cool feel and looks really fun inside.  Next time we'll eat there.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza. Ultra friendly service. A warm, inviting environment.   If you only read that far, it pretty much covers my experience at Base. We stopped in on a busy Friday night but were greeted promptly and with gusto from one of the owners who was also our server. We started out with the flatbread and house made dips. The two dips were perfectly portioned for the 8 slices of flatbread. I'm not sure what they were...besides really tasty. (The owner was incredibly busy, but I have no doubt he would have answered any questions that we had about the dish. We're just love trying new things, so we just went with it!)  The wines were written on a chalkboard on the wall. It seemed like they had a good selection, with glasses starting at $5. But we both prefer beer, so we ordered a few glasses. They were nice and cold, if slightly smaller than I would have liked for $6 a piece.  We chose the El Diablo to share. The pizza itself was a thing of beauty. A wood fired pizza can be a disaster if done incorrectly, but they certainly know what they're doing. The crust was crispy but not overly so, and spotted but not burnt. All of the ingredients were of the highest quality, which reflected in the incredible flavors. The tomato sauce was simple and fresh.  It was topped with soppressata, kalamata olives, and peppers. It was slightly spicy but might be more intense for those who aren't acclimated to spicy dishes.  It was a little more than I spend on an average Friday pizza night, but the quality is so good that I can see myself coming back for sure. Plus, Tuesday nights they have half price pizzas. In other words, I think I've found a new night to go out for pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is flat out wonderful. It had everything a great pizza place needs: a good ambiance, great appetizers, exceptional service, and of course amazing pizza. Coming in, the staff was very inviting and helped us to a table right away. The Aussie charm, wit, and humor along with being prompt on any order we placed was a combination for incredible service. The waiter was very conversational but in the good way where it's important to connect with patrons without annoying them. Had the meat and cheese board for a starter and everything on it was extremely delicious. It came with a few pieces of this bread that had a great crunch and melted in my mouth. It was incredible. The pizzas are personal size and thin crust, which I prefer. The \"Roni\" was incredible, some of the best tasting pepperoni I've ever had. The Sauce isn't heavy and very creamy which I really enjoyed and I'm not a huge pizza/red sauce fan. Crust was nice and crunchy with a small char on it, and still soft on the inside and to me that is the perfect crust. These Aussies really know how to run a good pizza joint, and I will be certainly coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent casual meal. Special pizzas and salads. Delicious with very friendly wait staff. Try the Samuel Smith beer from the UK - it's great!"}
{"text":"This doesn't need to be a long review, but look at this five star rating they have. Yelp LOVES to drop places down to 4 1/2 stars as soon as possible and this still hasn't happened at Base Pizzeria.  Try the Carolina Reaper chili oil. Made on premises from local peppers and olive oil - sublime.  This is some of the best pizza available in Arizona and the best service in the area, bar none.  source: I was 320 pounds like maybe eight or nine years ago, so there was a time when I was eating a LOOOOOOT of pizza."}
{"text":"I was a little conflicted about writing this review, because I love a local pizza joint and admire  family business owners...  Let me break it down....  Atmosphere:  Clean and stylish, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar.  4 stars  Service:  Prompt and attentive, there were a handful of diners but they weren't what I would consider busy last night.   4 stars  Appetizer:  We had the Toasted AZ Bread, which is drizzled in EVOO.  It was very simple but good.  $3  -  4 stars  Pizza:  I ordered \"The Roni\" + mushrooms. It looked amazing, but this pizza was not my favorite, for lack of a better word it tasted wet or watery.  The crust on the outside was crispy but the crust under the pizza was soggy.  I don't mind greasy pizza, like a great NYC slice that you must fold in half, but this wasn't grease.    On top of that the pepperoni was sliced with some of the casing left on it, so there were thin strings of casing I had to pull out of my mouth with each bite, I don't think thing they leave this on intentionally and if so I didn't enjoy it, imagine chewing on bits of dental floss.   It had the potential to be really great, but fell short.  My boyfriend got the Margherita and he said I got the bad piece but it was soggy too.  Sadly only 2 stars on the pizza.   I wanted to give this place four stars, but I can't when the pizza experience wasn't good and its a pizzeria. I've had worse but I wouldn't go back on my own.  I am an equal opportunity pizza eater....NY, Chicago, delivery, Degornio, I don't discriminate but it just wasn't all about the Base for me last night..."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Like all the other reviews - u feel like you are \"family\" there. Went with two other friends of mine and we all had a great time.   Our server (male brother. Forgot his name) is hilarious and was really personable from the start. We did two pizzas and a salad and we all left full but not food coma full.   Pizza was very good, service was excellent. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I had wanted to visit Base for the longest time, and finally got the opportunity a couple months ago. I know this place gets glowing reviews, unfortunately I thought it was just OK. There were some items I really liked like the bruschetta and the pear salad....Yum. but the pizza was nothing terribly exciting, run of the mill fancy Italian pizza. Extra points for having super tasty spicy olive oils. There are just too many awesome pizza places in Phoenix to return to one that's just OK."}
{"text":"I joined my friend for a fun lunch on the patio this week.  For Arizona the weather was crisp (a brisk 78! Ha!) and they supply cozy blankets to take the chill off.  I ordered the Special Pizza of the day-A Bolognese-and my friend had a White Bean Pizza Special that they customized for her vegan diet.  The pizza was thin-with a chewy crust-and just the right amount of toppings.  The ambience is delightful-and the server quite engaging.  I will be back for more pizza with pizzazz!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend for my birthday. I ordered the white truffle pizza. I added prosciutto to it. This was very delicious. The only downside was no ranch! Am I the only person who likes ranch with my pizza? Lol.   They also brought out a little dessert for my birthday which was really nice. This was a really cute date spot. And they also have a cute little patio too. The customer service was good. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Owners are Aussie so that's like a huge bump in stars because they have great Aussie beers. I must have ordered like 6 pizzas and 15 beers when I was there and didn't care because the service was amazing, the food is delicious and the ambiance and atmosphere is light, friendly and intoxicating.   You guys are doing it right! Thanks for the awesome time!"}
{"text":"Loved base pizzeria. Food was awesome. Service was awesome. View was awesome. Drink was a more than generous whiskey pour. Since my visit here I finally went to Pizzeria Bianco for the first time and in my opinion it wasn't even close to as good as Base."}
{"text":"Quality of the food great. Service on the other hand was not. We stopped in after a long day of driving dressed in average clothes and from the time we walked in to the time we left we did not feel welcomed at all. Good food but without good service it's not much."}
{"text":"Uh! Heaven has a BASE!! I've heard lots of people bragging about this place and, indeed, it did not disappoint. We were warmly welcomed by the owner, Carlee (I hope I spelled it right), which immediately seated us on the patio and offered us specials of the day. My roommate and I had the beet and arugula bruschetta, freshly served with balsamic reduction, and then we went for a Spicy Snag and a Mediterranean pizza...BOTH SUBLIME!! The crust is thin and crispy, and it makes that nice crunchiness sound when you bite it, you can tell it's good stuff! We loved the atmosphere as well, enjoying the mountains view with Frank Sinatra's songs (big thumb up for that) is just what you need to accompany a good meal!! I also appreciated their dessert selection: not the usual tiramisu or cannoli as you might assume in a pizzeria, they had the most extraordinary homemade Australian Pavlova and the portion was pretty generous too. Prices are fair, $10-15 for a pizza, $14 for the dessert - I was a bit turned off by that at first, but on second thoughts I agree it's totally worth it. Service was great, Carlee made our experience phenomenal. So we will definitely come back!!! :-)"}
{"text":"We decided to try Base after reading a local news piece about it. We had been to the predecessor restaurant in the space and Base initially appeared to have done very little to change the rectangular strip mall feel of the restaurant. They have however added a nice patio, and the Phoenix Fall weather was perfect for an evening outside.  We entered the restaurant and the 1st thing we noticed was the absence of a host desk, and indeed a host. The place was half full, with one large table of about a dozen people and a  couple of 4 tops occupied inside and a few tables occupied on the patio. We waited patiently for someone to notice us and after about 5 minutes, during which we thought about leaving, someone came up to us and greeted us. This laissez-faire approach was unfortunately a harbinger of the service to come.  We were seated and it took several more minutes for the table to be cleaned and menus provided. Interestingly there were zero condiments on the table. No salt, pepper, olive oil or balsamic vinegar.  The menu is small, which is probably a good idea for a new restaurant. The primary dishes are all interesting sounding pizzas, but Phoenix has a surfeit of excellent neapolitan style thin crust pizza places, so we were hoping it would be good.  We ordered a caprese salad to split while we waited for our Pizzas. The caprese took at least a half hour and during this wait nothing other than water was offered. we asked for some lemon for the water, but it never showed up. No bread either, to tide us over as they clearly struggled to serve the large party inside.  It was a pleasant evening and we had some catching up to do on the day's events so we bided our time.  The salad arrived and was delicious. I asked for a little more olive oil, but by the time it arrived we were already done.  A while later, at least 15 minutes, our waiter came by to say the pizzas were on their way out any second. It turned out that a second at Base is at least 10 minutes long. Finally the pizzas arrived. One was a classic with added fennel sausage and the other was Mediterranean inspired with olives and artichokes.  At first bite the ingredients were fresh and lovely but the crust was baked way too hard. Not burnt, but literally stiff as a board with no moisture in it. The pizza edges could be used as nails to hold down a tent. Disappointing to say the least. To their credit they recognized the disarray in their service and comped the salad but I'm not sure they are worth a repeat visit, especially with so many other good pizza places nearby. Pomo in Scottsdale comes to mind.  Prices were about what you should expect at a good pizza place but they need to figure out how to put some moisture back in their crust, and they certainly need to figure the logistics of service. A host to greet diners would also be a nice improvement"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp!! Love this little hidden gem!! Yummy local spot that we will come back to for sure!! The Amalfi Salad (no lettuce - more like chopped veggie) was so fresh and so delicious. The wood fired base pizza was devoured by my 6 year old. Good sauce and excellent cheese. Loved the whole experience (even the passion fruit green tea was awesome!!). Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty low when my friend suggested we meet at Base for dinner.  I am not a huge pizza fan.  I may have been converted.    We ordered the capressi appetizer.   Wonderful tomatoes, fresh mix and herbs...wonderful.  My friend, confused by my enthusiasm for the dish as I normally pick tomato out of my food, laughed as I explained, \"No, these are REAL tomatoes!\"   I wanted bread to soak up the remains of the balsamic and oil.  The pizza crust sufficed.   The pizza special was equally wonderful.  Even my picky \"avoid weird food\" friend thought the pear, bacon and cheese combo topped with arugula was spot on.  So good.  Glad I kept my app plate to soak the \"pizza bones\" -- no crumb left behind.    Service was pretty great but for one little etiquette tip...okay, a health tip.  When cleaning up a small beverage spill, wipe the table before you wipe the floor.  That could have freaked out someone else, but there was no food on the table and I don't think we realized how much actually spilled.  Her intent was to wipe off the table only, until I pointed out the spill on the floor.  Tip from a former server: Coffee presses (And some carafes) are a notoriously leaky pour, don't rush it.   It was surprisingly quiet in the restaurant for a Friday night, but there was steady take out traffic.  Hopefully, they have enough loyal customers to sustain in restaurant saturated Phoenix.    All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"How wonderful it is to finally find a place I can actually eat and have no allergic reactions!!! Yup! That is correct... after close to 8 years of not being able to fully enjoy any restaurants offering healthy foods I found one...  and not only the food is delicious, the atmosphere and decor are super cool and enjoyable and the service is SUPERB! Is that good that made it there 3 times within one week... and have yet to experience any issues with my allergies! (And I am allergic to a lot of things... wheat, eggs, dairy) Love this place!!"}
{"text":"The stars clearly have nothing to do with the food.   Would have been nice if they could have posted their \"closed for summer break\"  on their website.   We drove 30 minutes to eat here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pizza and Wine restaurant in the valley.  The food is amazing and all organic with a great wine selection.  The owners always offer a warm welcome and the service is the best.  Their sister restaurant The Smith is just as great for breakfast.  I highly recommend you to try these two great restaurants as you will enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"It is all about the Base...Pizzeria! Great location easy to get to and there is plenty of parking. It is a very clean restaurant with a sleek yet simple build out. I know pizza places are popping up all over, but this is more than pizza. The salads were excellent! Perfect size, fresh ingredients and extremely tasty. We ordered the summer salad with shrimp, organic pear and a few other organic items...yummmmm! The Base cheese pizza was solid and a really fresh veggie pizza. We went in early with our two kids; super accommodating and there were a few other tables with younger children. I could see not taking them in as the night got later, but early on in the night was perfect. Highly recommend as the entire staff is friendly which makes for an overall great dining experience."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town...took family and business associates here and cannot believe how chewy and crispy the pizza was with a delicate amount of sauce.  Staff knew the wine, construction paper on the table, fit us in on short notice!  There selection of mild to hot olive oils...amazing!  Great with kids too!"}
