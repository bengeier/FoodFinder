{"text":"Great food, terrible service - I recommend it only if your eating TO GO."}
{"text":"Love all the dishes that I have tried so far. We started going back to this restaurant after a long hiatus. Still as good as it used to be. Love the Combination plates and they are big. I always substitute the charro beans for the plates that come with refried. The green salsa is to die for. Service has never been bad. It is a must try."}
{"text":"If you want the best shredded beef look no further.  This review is strictly on the shredded beef burrito and the  shredded beef quesadilla.  Have had other things they were typical for a Mexican place. Chips and salsa were ok nothing great but again if you like shredded beef this is the place"}
{"text":"Food was great and was a nice change from the standard Mexican joint. Atmosphere was kinda like a cafeteria and lighting was way too bright. That said the food was a solid 3.5 stars. Atmosphere 2 with an average of 3."}
{"text":"We love it here. The green sauce is fabulous and everything seems fresh and made to order....except the charro beans that have been cooking all day to perfection. I forgot to take a picture before I dove right in."}
{"text":"This is a nice authentic Mexican food restaurant. They have the best tortilla soup I have ever had. The service is great and the also the food. You must try the deep fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Everything is do delicious!!! I love the cheese they have! The green enchiladas suizas are my favorite. Their salsa and pico de gallo is great! I totally recommend this place (:"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from here for 2 years and finally tried it.  OMG - so mad I waited so long.   In a city that thinks it knows Mexican food - look no further.  One taste of the green sauce with chips (avocado based) and you'll agree!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but 2 stars for service!!!! Sorry but if I ask for a recommendation and you say \"uhhhhhh I don't know there's a lot\" you shouldn't Be waiting tables. Can you not recommend ONE thing on your menu?! Like that is crazy to me.    I hope she brings home a menu tonight and brushes up on her product!!!"}
{"text":"We bought one of those discount coupons for this restaurant, so a Friday afternoon lunch seemed the perfect time to try it out.  It's been ages since I've been here.  We arrived a few minutes after 11am (when they open) and along with one other table - we were the only ones in the place. Great service!  We ordered a dish with a lot of melted cheese (their specialty?) and I ordered the veggie fajitas.  Both were good.    Because of the coupon, we needed to purchase a minimum in food and beverage, so we also ordered two desserts.  The flan was o.k. and the sopapillas were awesome!  Would we recommend?  Absolutely.    Try to order from the lunch menu - seems like its a good deal for the price.  Drinks are unlimited too."}
{"text":"I have been coming to various La Parillas for over 20 years. Originally Tucson. They have been consistently good in every way. They use different rice in Tucson, and it's better. Be sure to save room for the fried ice cream, as it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Bummer heard they closed. Had been going there for years. Although a few months ago the place (tatum location), was looking run down and my wife said the bathroom was quite filthy.. No sure what happened  but I will miss them"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend. As a always do before eating is go into the restroom and wash my hands. As I am washing my hands I see a RAT TRAP under or behind the toilet. That killed me. Will never eat here and will be calling the health departments. I wish I would have gotten a picture of that trap."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Kid friendly.  Server and hostess were a bit spacey, but friendly.  Some items were excellent.  Some were just ok.  Didn't like the sopapillas."}
{"text":"If you want to taste the Mexico City flavor come and eat here. The food was great like always nice and hot. The tortillas were fresh made and the salsas with chips were delicious. Try to Oder the parrillada mixta you won't be disappointed is like fajitas but with a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"As always, great service, nice atmosphere and awesome authintic Mexican food. Must try this place out!"}
{"text":"They have a dish that I love here (cheese dish), it is the most simple recipe in the planet big is nothing but the best! The food is delicious and the service is friendly, I couldn't help but feel like I was with my family, I recommend this for a casual outing!"}
{"text":"Been a customer of this restaurant for six years, normally service is good and food is great. Unfortunately, this past year food quality and service has dropped exponentially for the exception of one or two servers. Whether it's stale avocado or chips or the a/c is broken it's sad to see a once great restaurant slowly go down the drain."}
{"text":"Very good service and good food! Definitely a fun place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This was an interesting adventure, so let us begin.........We were seated promptly. For a full restaurant, this was pretty good. Now, it did take awhile before someone came and took our drink order; however, the waitress recognized that and took our food order as well (without writing it down). Now just as our waitress was bringout out our food, a waiter carrying iced tea decided that drinks would be on me....and I am NOT talking about \"paying for everyones drinks\". While I had a soaked shirt, the good news was that it was iced tea and not some HOT food/drink. The waitress promptly attended to us, moving us to another table and added complimentary desserts for me and my family (about $18 worth). The waiter made it a point to ask if I was OK. Now, remember, the waitress took our order WITHOUT writing it down AND the order came out just as ordered. I had one of the specialty Parrilla plates with chorizo, fajita, queso fundido, quesadillas, charro beans and grilled onions. ALL perfectly seasoned. The complimentary dessert was homemade flan and fried ice cream. The flan had a nice creamy texture and just melted in your mouth. It came with fresh blueberries, a large fresh strawberry and whipped cream. Again, all very good. I assume the fried ice cream was good, because my daughter finished it. All in all, I would definitely make a return trip......the recovery for \"drinks on me\" was satisfactory, except I would have liked a manager come personally apologize for that mishap. This is why this visit gets only 3 stars."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food, the service is always good, the chunky and the green salsas are amazing and the tortilla soup is divine!  I could eat here every day if I could afford it...both financially and at my waistline!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and asked the waiter what the 3 most popular menu items were and ordered both. The food was terribly bland and unforgettable. I did enjoy the live music and the ambiance was nice. However, I only go back to restaurants for the food and service and this place lost it on the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for an early Valentine dinner yesterday.  It was one of the worst Mexican meals we have ever had. And all for $41.  The salsas they serve with chips were decent but sloppy as the dishes they are served in do not properly fit in the holder.  2nd. My husband asked for what beers were available, there was a list with the menus that boasted they had many on tap, waiter informed us all the beer they had was bottled.  Enchiladas, We can make better at home.  The meat for the tacos were good, the rice was good, everything else was very under par, especially for a restaurant that they are Authentic Mexico City Style, We think NOT!  We will not recommend or return."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 6 years and have had good and bad experiences. The food is good but does not consistently taste the same every time for some reason.    When you get there you are greeted with chips and a generous serving of three different salsas. I was raised in a home where we make fresh salsa for almost every meal so I am very particular about it having the right taste and consistency.  70% of the time the salsas taste great but they do have their \"off\" days when it's either too watery, salty, not enough salt, or not the right balance of chili and tomatillo.    For my appetizer I order the melted cheese or \"queso fundido\" and it comes with flour or hand made corn tortillas. For my entr√©e I usually order the #14 (red sauce, cheese filled enchiladas with 2 carne asana tacos, rice and beans) it's a pretty good amount of food for about $12.    All in all the place is clean, has a great atmosphere and most of the time friendly staff. Just expect to be amazed or disappointed with the salsas once in a while."}
{"text":"My husband, my sister and I ate there at lunch today.  They had chimichangas and both enjoyed them.  I, who LOVE enchiladas and almost always order them at a Mexican restaurant, ordered a combination of enchiladas and tacos.  The tacos were OK but the enchiladas were lousy!  The sauce was very boring - too much tomato, not enough pepper and the enchiladas were not cooked thoroughly.  They were edible but wouldn't order them again.  Service was friendly and atmosphere was nice.  However, with all the other choices for Mexican food in the area, I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"We miss you. The place you left  on Tatum is still not occupied.  35th ave is a long drive from Tatum and Shea, but in my opinion and my opinion only, is worth it. The food here is always made with care and fresh. The prices reasonable and the service prompt. So, why am I giving them 4 stars? Because not all the servers are fluent in English and for this Irishman, sometimes it gets little difficult to understand. Nevertheless, that never stopped me to regularly make the trip and enjoy their outstanding food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I had high hopes for this place being more than a generic wanna-be authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'm sure this place is better than what I experienced but I probably won't give it a 2nd chance and here's why.  Our waiter was so dull & clueless.  I seriously think he must be a relative they HAD to employ.  I know it's not a dream job but he really looked upset to be there.  Whenever I go to a new place I always ask what dish makes their restaurant worth coming back for... you know, what do people tend to favor.  He had no clue how to answer this.  I asked if they had any drink specials & he said no.  Turns out they had Sangria (which I usually like), but I didn't order it b/c I had already ordered a beer.  He was rushing us to order.  If I had more time we would have ordered an appetizer, but I guess he prefer we spend less.  I asked for green enchiladas, instead I got red.  He could only do one thing at a time.  When he brought our order, instead of clearing our table to make room for the plates, he just plopped down the meals on top of the dishes already there - making a lot of noise and making things flop all around.  I saw dishes on other people's tables that looked better than ours, which only made me blame the waiter more for rushing us.  While it may not be fair to judge this entire restaurant because of one waiter, the fact that they let this guy work in public makes me question anything this place does.  But what about the food?...  very mediocre.  My favorite part of the meal was the beans... pretty sad."}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona for 25 years and the first 15 years in Tucson.   I have been going to your restaurants for all of these years.   It used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, I can tell you now it has fallen not only past the bottom of my list but completely off the list of not just Mexican Restaurants but all restaurants.   I will not come back, nor will I ever recommend it.  Here is what happened.    We came to the Tatum Blvd one Sunday evening about 6pm.    There were maybe 10 tables with people, not busy at all.   I was with my wife and 2 kids, we were seated right away and our waiter was nice enough at first.    My son ordered the #52 as he always does, my wife ordered #24 but thought she was ordering #21, my daughter ordered her customary Cheese quesadilla from the kids menu and I ordered #39 (thought I'd try something different.).   First off my sons, silverware was dirty, (set ups) he simply took some from another table, seemed like not a big deal at the time.   Then when my wife's meal came 5 or so minutes late after everyone else's it was the Vegetarian Burrito not the Fajitas she thought she ordered.   Rather than trying to make it right for her the waiter became argumentative and told her that is what she ordered and gave her no option.    What makes this interesting is she ordered it as #24 but said to the waiter she wanted the Fajitas.   Her mistake but is the customer always right?  Should the waiter try to make her experience correct even if she made the error?   Should we have had the option of getting her the meal she wanted-even if you offered at a cost to us?    I did get my order and it wasn't as good as I expected but it was what I ordered, 1 BIG Standing tray of food, but not a Plate to be had.   Consequently, I dropped a Chorizo covered spoon on my clothing because I had this elevated monstrosity of a serving dish in front of me but no plate to eat of off.     Lastly but probably the most important was my son's dinner.   It seems he had a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT in his re-fried beans; it looked and felt like a pebble.   We pointed that out to our waiter, he response was: \"I'm sorry.\"    I would have thought we'd see a manager by that point but we did not.   I would think a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT which  was clearly not food in my son's beans warranted a free meal if not our entire bill given as complimentary.   You could have had some expensive dental work to pay for.     Here is the deal.   I am not happy, my wife is not happy, and my son is not happy and begged us not to go because we have had either bad service, messed up food orders, plus I have even had Chicken bones in my food in the past.   In fact I remember a time when he ordered #52 with beef before got it with chicken instead and they brought him an entire 2nd meal because of the error.    My 9 year old daughter is the only one in the family that likes it; plus it's pretty had to mess up a Cheese quesadilla (her order every time).   Here's the other tidbit of knowledge she doesn't get to be the one who buys dinners out, I am.    The consumer votes with dollars and I will cast my vote to not spend them in your restaurants again.    Please let me know your thoughts I am very interested to know.   I paid with a credit card the bill totaled $49 and I tipped only $5 because of the sub standard service, I am sure you can find my order in your records.   I have probably had over 100+ meals from your restaurants over the years and I must say the Phoenix stores or should say at least the one at Paradise Valley Mall is terrible.   I don't think I ever had a bad meal at the Speedway location but I moved to Phoenix over 10 years ago and do not go to that location any longer, I cannot say the same for this location."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever.  Would rather eat at Taco Bell.  There are so many better options in Arizona, I dont know why you would eat here."}
{"text":"Always pass by this place so we thought we would stop and give it a try. I'm thinking that was a mistake. First of all, we have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and have never seen a menu like this, it was basically foreign to my fiance and I. We both had some questions about a few things on the menu that we planned to ask our waitress. Only when the waitress came to take our order we discovered that she barely spoke any English. When our food came it wasn't what either one of us expected. Apparently I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which I wrongly assumed was going to be enchiladas. Food was very bland. Needless to say, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"I have been comming to this restaurant for over 25 years. Well this year hasn't been the best. A couple of months ago some one tipped themselves alot. I did get that money back finally. I was there last night and ordered the table grill cheese, it barely fed 2 let alone the 6 it claimes. You could see the bottom of the grill. Then the plate that came out was not what we ordered. Then next plate was not what we ordered. The server appeared upset and told the manager who would not come over and speak with us. We did only get one bowl of chips,  had to track down our own silverware. Refill of soda 2 min before we left. They did take off our plate, which I didn't ask them to do that. I have no problem paying and tipping as long as the food is right. They seem to go up and down here and it is frustrating,  but when they are on target they are great."}
{"text":"Food was not good at all I got the tacos and enchiladas both were cold when they came out my kids got the quesadillas and those were also gross I will never be back here"}
{"text":"B and I had lunch here. They have decent lunch specials--only $5.99 for a large entree and rice, beans, salad. I had the tortilla soup. Very basic broth with cheese and tortilla strips. Lots of cheese, a little salty. For the entree I had the beef chimichanga. Honestly I was too full from my soup and chips & salsa to have more than 2 bites. But it was decent. B had the chicken tamales. Too much cheese for him and portions were huge. Overall, wasn't too impressed with our food. Perhaps the grilled stuff is better."}
{"text":"We like this place very much. The cheese appet. is to die for.  The service is allways good . Same servers for a long time. That is a good sighn of a good restaurant . Great lacation with a lot of parking."}
{"text":"Some of the BEST Mexican food I have ever had! Everything had great flavor and the rice was cooked properly. We all tried something different and everything I tried was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service . Fast service . Good food. Price was good too. Can't complain.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Staff is quick and the food is petty good. the Charo beans are gross! To the point I wouldn't ever order them again.. but there refried beans are good as well there enchiladas! My favorite dish is the carne asada.. but it is served with an orange sauce that has no flavor and horrible texture.."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews for this place and had to laugh. Most of the people who said the food is terrible are probably used to Sonoran Mexican food. This is Mexico city style! I grew up on the Mexican border in Texas and spent a lot of time visiting family in Mexico. I have to say after moving to Arizona 3 years ago I had given up on \"good\" Mexican food because I hate Sonoran style food. I stumbled upon this place stopped in for dinner and fell in love! I felt like I was finally having a taste of home. The food is authentic and the service is great! Staff is friendly and attentive. Also I read someone say they charge you for refills on drink which is no longer the case! Everyone looking for a change from the usual Sonoran style of AZ should try this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent in every possible way.  Portion size perfect, service fast and polite, food fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good I would put it at four Stars... the server is what pushed it to the five star level."}
{"text":"Ants crawling on ledge bordering kitchen and table we sat at.  No diet coke.  Food decent but the ants creeped me out!"}
{"text":"Food here is awesome!!!!! What I recommend is the Mole enchiladas !!!! Yum"}
{"text":"Appetizers are great and good ritas..not strong enough for my liking but weren't overly sweet. We sat at bar and ate and the people behind the bar were very friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress completely forgot to bring my meal out and was not apologetic at all. This is some bullshit"}
{"text":"My husband got the 3 shredded beef enchiladas with with chile verde. He absolutely loved. We were scared this place would be the typical novelty kinda food but it was pretty darn yummy. Do try the shrimp tacos, its what I got. Those tacos are grilled with bell peppers, onions, and BACON! Omgaw....delish!!!"}
{"text":"So, I Order The \"Side Fish Taco\"  For 3 bucks, When it came I was like ok cool they give you a good amount for 3 buck so I asked \"this is the side taco right\" she said \"yes that's why is doesn't come with rice or beans\" They Where not good at all to be honest I didn't even them or take the rest to go and I very rarely leave food. So the bill came it was 12 bucks. So I said \"I order the side for 3 dollars why is it 12 bucks\" (Keep in mind I pointed at the menu and said my order twice to make sure She understood me.)  She said \"O I thought you order something else\" and what ever she thought I said wasn't even on the menu. So I will never go back to this place waist of money and time"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexico City food.  Great chips and salsa (three types of salsa arrive with your chips)  Their queso and chips appetizer is awesome, and I'm rather partial to the  Chimi.  Not the best Mexican food, but by far not the worst.  Their Margaritas are also an excellent way to stave off the Arizona heat in the summer."}
{"text":"Went to La Parilla Suiza today for lunch.  Had my Livingsocial coupon.  Read reviews before I left for the restaurant.  Was ready for the worst.  It never happened.  The waitress was very helpful, smiling and pleasant to be around.  The assistant manager came over to look at our coupon and told us we had $30.00 worth of food to order and still had another 3 dollars to spend.  He checked on us to see how we liked our food.  The restaurant had about 8 tables full which was pretty good for a Sunday at 12:00.  I will be returning as the food was delicious.  I had the chicken faitas and my husband had #32.  He said he would order it again.  The salsas and chips were excellent."}
{"text":"We love this place and go at least twice a month. The service is consistently good, as well as the food. Love the salsas and green sauce---so good! It is reliable, clean, fast, and inexpensive. We have been going for years and have always had good waiters! Great for families!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Mexican place!!! Their salsas are INCREDIBLE (especially that green salsa.. hhmmm... could eat that for a whole meal!)  I highly recommend #14 and any of the hot plates. The mini chimis are also off daaa hook. Happy hour is a great time to go because of half-off apps and decent deals on drinks/margaritas.   Sometimes the service can be a little off, but I feel as if that adds to the authenticity of the place lol. I get it over it really fast when I get more chips and salsa, which they just keep bringing by the way. And if they don't, don't be afraid to ask for more :)  Go there. Try it. My husband and I take everyone there. ENJOY!! Eat salsa."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this restaurant. The location is not so great...just a strip mall, but I think their food is excellent. We are vegetarian, so we get the same thing every time we go...split the cheese enchilada and cheese tamale plate. It is so good. We also love the chips and salsa and margaritas!!"}
{"text":"I think the food is good and the service top notch.  I would send my friends to this location.  We have eaten here several times."}
{"text":"We went in for a birthday dinner with my family last weekend.  I would say overall it was a good experience.  The queso dip was great and the entire table seemed happy with their meals.  A couple concerns though - they were promoting specials on the table, but when I attempted to order the special of the night,  they told me that Friday and Saturday were excluded. (not stated on table topper)  Also, gratuity was included to our party of 6, but I was not informed of this.  I always think it is best practice to tell the customer.  I will be back, hopefully next time will be a 5 Star experience."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. Hadn't been here in several years, but thought it was better than this. First the highlights. Service was good, salsa tray ok, pork tacos tasty.  The bad: enchilada sauce bland, same for the chilaquiles. Plus they were overwhelmed with cheese that tasted bland. Beans were MEH.   For the prices they charge I was swindled. Sorry never going back unless I hear they've added good taste to the good. So unfortunate because I recall this being a nice place."}
{"text":"Super fresh food and amazing margaritas!  This is not a Tex-mex kind of place, but one with authentic, fresh Mexican food.  The shrimp tacos were the best!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the ambiance was fun and lively. Even the manager was attentive.  Big plus, tortillas are handmade."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  I like the melted cheese and fajitas.  The food they cook is authentic for sure.  The service is great as well.  Great food at reasonable prices.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is ok but no excuse for having a dirty metal holder for the salsa."}
{"text":"$15 per person price for fajitas, 1 chicken breast and handful of onion and pepper. Food is decent but pricey."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place Friday night when the wait for Texas Roadhouse across the street was going to be ridiculously long. We were seated immediately, and our waitress was awesome. Very attentive and humorous. We started out with an appetizer - a cheese crisp with shredded beef. I was worried that it wouldn't be worth the almost $9 price tag (how could a tortilla with cheese be worth that much?). Boy was I wrong! I don't know if I was just starving, or if it really was just that good, but that was the best shredded beef I think I've ever had. I could've eaten just that with some rice and beans and been happy.   My husband ordered the alambre chicken burrito and loved it. He gave me a bite and that might be what I get the next time we come! The vegetables were crisp, the meat was tender and the marinade was fantastic.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas con mole. I'd never had mole sauce before and wanted to try something new. The risk paid off because it was amazing! I would've bent my normal rule and taken a picture of my food, but it would've looked like a plate of fancy poo. Trust me, it was good. Haha!"}
{"text":"People stop ordering TexMex type foods here. This is a \"Mexico City\" type of restaurant. If your preferred version of Mexican food is enchiladas go elsewhere, better yet, try something new such as the Alambre Tacos or number 15, try the queso suizo appetizer or anything except the pedestrian fair that is at most American Mexican restaurants. This restaurant is much better than it is rated as most of the  poor reviews are for TexMex stuff."}
{"text":"I have been coming here over twenty years the food is great. But the server cut lemons by hand without gloves on top of the dishwasher in the bar while the manger watched her. I told the manger she was too busy was her response. She was three feet away. Now the restaurant is charging for salsa refill. My how things have changed. I love their food but won't be back due to sanitation. It is a sad day!"}
{"text":"The food was good but overall I would suggest finding somewhere else. The service was a little slow, the food was alright but not amazing (and we are in Phoenix, don't settle for mediocre). It felt like a chain restaurant.  On the upside, it might be good for large groups."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know. After sitting at the table for 20 minutes without service I left. That's the good thing about this town is you can throw a rock and hit good Mexican food. I would suggest la Frontera down the street"}
{"text":"Solid three. Mexico City style food. Good service. (way better than places like Macayo's.)"}
{"text":"The worst customer service! Talked to the manager and to my surprised he was very rude, his attitude was as if he was doing us a favor. Very surprised and dissapointed! We were regulars and have done several get together with 20+people, I guess he does not appreciate our business. So happy that in this area we have hundreds of other very good places were we are treated as value customers!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Food was excellent and affordable, and the waiter that served us was fantastic. Atmosphere was also great. Two thumbs way up (and five stars)."}
{"text":"I am here for the queso.  It is just that good!  The food is good too but, the queso Suizo is just phenomenal. Good enough for two as an appetizer or as part of their #16 platter.  Great combination, pretty sizable."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food was delicious. My date and I shared the tortilla soup and the server graciously brought out an additional small bowl without us even asking. The enchilada con mole was fantastic! The side of beans that came with it reminded me of my Mexican grandfather's recipe and brought back great memories. We will most definitely be going back very soon! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"My family went here yesterday for lunch. All though the salsa was ok, that's where it ends!!!  I got a chicken chimichanga. The chicken tasted straight out of a can. Also, I could not eat the tortilla and the sauce they put over the top. I took 1 bite and it tasted terrible. Something was WAY off. My husband got the fish tacos. They literally looked like frozen fish sticks on top of a corn tortilla. Long story short, today has been a miserable day with what seems to be food poisoning!!! Never Ever going back!"}
{"text":"It was recommended by my family. Being raised on mexican food and being mexicano..let me just say the food was awesome and authentic.i ordered the enchiladas con mole and was very pleased the mole tasted just like homemade. It was also the first time we went in and our waiter comped us our drinks!! A few beers for free thank you!  Definitely going to be heading back to this joint. Pretty much estaba muy rico."}
{"text":"The service was very good overall. Why I only gave 3 stars is because our food was only warm, not hot. Our fajitas weren't sizzling either. They was again, just warm. Food taste was good, but I've never had Mexican food served just warm. A friend ordered the fried ice cream and it looked like ice cream wrapped in corn flakes. The corn flakes were even stale! That was probably the only bad part of the meal...  Not sure I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"My personal favorite mexican sit down place in PHX!! Great margarita and everything on the menu has always been top notch and authentic!!!"}
{"text":"Hell no will I ever go here again nor invite my family. I called ahead to see what time they closed and was told 10:00 showed up at 9:40 and was told no,no. We're closed. Wtf. I felt like changing the sign with my magic marker from 10pm to 9:30'ish? This restaurant clearly doesn't need yours or my patronage. Cause dammit we don't matter as customers they close whenever so beat it. Stay clear, they may give as much care to the food in the back as they do customer service."}
{"text":"Wow, this was tasteless food. Even the salsa for the chips was thin and tasteless. I had a carne asada burrito that was dry and 90% tortilla. The rest of the table  experienced the same thing. Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite places!! The food is DELISH!! The service is a top of their game."}
{"text":"The best, unknown Mexican food in Phoenix.  Homemade tortillas, fresh tasting food, very authentic.  Chips and salsa are amazing."}
{"text":"Beef that tastes fishy & other awful experiences...  The arguments that I have seen for this restaurant on other sites as to whether or not it's authentic Mexico City food is not even going to be brought up here; there are plenty of other things wrong with this restaurant and the food that simply go against common decent meals.  First of all, it should be noted that unlike most restaurants, especially Mexican restaurants, chips and salsa and non-alcoholic beverages come with 1 refill only; after that, you have to pay for extra.  The bowl of chips is small - my fellow diner and I went through it quickly waiting for our appetizer.  Then, after the bowl was empty, we were never - never even throughout the entire meal - offered our 'refill' for chips.  I understand a restaurant may not want to be wasteful, but this is just cheap and tacky.  Second of all, all of the menu items are about $2.00 overpriced, compared to other Mexican or TexMex places I have been to.  $10.99 goes about as far as 2 tiny - empty - \"cheese\" enchiladas (about 4 inches long, w/little inside but cheese suffocating the outside), and two tacos with some meat blobbed on and nothing else.  In Mexico, this should run me about $4.00, and in other AZ Mexican restaurants, about $8.99.  Third, the food was just plain awful.  Nevermind the appetizer of the skillet of cheese - think cheese pizza without the pizza, with extra oil and a nauseating stomachache to follow.  We couldn't even eat half of it.  And there's no dipping - although hot, it's harder cheese that has to be cut with a knife.    Then onto the aforementioned enchiladas and tacos.  The shredded beef tasted like fish.  Makes me wonder what's going on in their kitchen.  I lifted up the taco and water poured - not dripped, poured - out of the shell, explaining why the shell was then soggy and vile.  Think wet cardboard.  I ate half of the first taco and couldn't stomach it any longer.  The enchiladas exemplify the cook's answer to everything - drench and hide the food in cheese and sauce.  Nothing was inside, except a tad of what seeped in from the outside.  I didn't touch the beans - they too looked like they were soaking in a bowl of water, but I tried the rice: no texture - almost mush, very bland.  This should be one of the basics.  And buyer beware: the \"Suiza\" sauce - which at first glance on the menu one might assume that the sauce is a special house sauce that adds that great vibrant kick to food - is actually just sour cream.  Whether they were trying to just sound unique or what on the menu, I don't know, but as someone who doesn't like sour cream, this is only a nuisance.    The service...I suppose E for Effort.  Neither of us ate hardly any of the \"food\" (and we aren't the 'send-it-back' type people), and the waitress was completely oblivious.  When she asked if we liked it, I gave a look like - no - and my boyfriend said it was 'okay'; and we clearly didn't want any boxes - you'd think something might have been done at that time - since she did *ask*...but no.  We were sent on our way and told to \"come back soon!\"  Nice, but dense.  Overall, Mexican or not, this can't be a good representation of Mexico.  If a Mexican restaurant can't get tacos right, they shouldn't be in business.  I would never waste another dime there, and would discourage friends as well.  Bad food, overpriced, with severely lacking service...that's probably why the place was nearly empty when we were there on what should have been a busier Wednesday night."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing restaurant!! The service is so wonderful. Everyone is so sweet and work very hard. Never had to wait for a refill on sodas or drinks! The food comes very quickly. The food is the most authentic Mexico City food we have had in az. The enchiladas and chile relleno are to die for!!!! Salsas are fantastic and I can't wait to try their margaritas, they just look so tasty."}
{"text":"My family loves it here.  We started out at the Tatum location, and then moved to Mesa.  We were so excited to find this location close to us.  Anytime we fell like having Mexican food this is our go to place.  Every on the menu is good.  Staff have always been super nice.  The manager usually comes around to make sure everything is going well."}
{"text":"It doesn't even seem right that I have never reviewed this place, as I've been coming to and raving about \"The Parilla\" for going on 7 years now.  It is my de facto \"friends in town and want some good Mexican\" stop.  In fact, I'm freakin' shocked by the low ratings this place is getting!!  As with anyone Mexican place, they start you out with chips and awesome salsa.  There's a spicy smooth red sauce, a pico-type salsa, and the piece de resistance....the avocado tomatillo salsa.  They do, however, charge for extra chips/salsa after the first freebie refill.  I recommend anyone try the Tortilla Soup (note: NOT a chicken tortilla soup).  You can get with or without toppings of sour cream and avocado for an additional cost, but I find it perfect as is.  It's mostly broth with cheese and tortilla strips (of course), but it is just such a delish soup. For my entree, I always get #25, which is a vegetarian combo of a tamale and cheese enchilada, which I have them use mole sauce instead of traditional enchilada sauce.  It comes with refried beans (the pinto beans are cooked with pork) and rice.  The soup and this plate are MORE than enough for dinner and breakfast/lunch the next day.  They have several other locations in the Valley, a few in Tucson, one in Guadalajara, and one in Mexico City."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was not very flavor full and the service was slow and non existent. We couldn't get out waitresses attention so my husband went to order a drink at the bar. There were 4 people behind the bar washing dishes and even looked up at him and didn't see of he needed assistance. This is not what I am used to from a Mexican restaurant. You don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Have i mentioned this is my favorite Mexico City Mexican food joint?! W/out a doubt consistent, fresh and cheap. Whenever i am in AZ this is my spot.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=9vEQ2jKcRGjryTyVEvZDmA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nsEO3MRzYLKfgtID7gvArw?select=w1hAI5b7FWBJ1WNQzRpplg"}
{"text":"My wife and I have always been a loyal customers of your Mesa location over the past several years.  We frequent your restaurant when ever we can.  It has  been a while since we have been out to eat due to the economy like everyone  else but when out of town guests was here about 2 weeks they wanted good Mexican food so of course we went to La Parrilla Suiza in Mesa.  What happened? When we arrived at your restaurant at about 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening we noticed that there were absolutely zero cars in the parking lot.  We surely thought that this cannot be a good thing.   We were the only customers inside.  We were so embarrassed over the food.  The quality of the food was extremely bad, so bad that no one in out group was able to finish their meals.  When we complained to both the server first and then we asked for the manager and complained to him and neither one seemed to care.  The manager actually said that was too bad that we did not like it and that other people usually do not complain.  \"REALLY\".  That's all you can say?  Two of our orders we had to send back to correct the problems (which they didn't) and that is all you can come up with?  Sooo sad.  I even made a comment that now I can understand why the restaurant was empty at 6:00pm on a Saturday evening.  The manager just shrugged his shoulders, turned and actually walked away.  The quantity of the food was not there either and the prices was too high for the what there was.  We do not mind paying a fair price for a good meal but the quality and value is no longer there.  After we ate our meals and spending a nearly $100.00 at this sorry excuse of a restaurant we were all still hungry so we decided to try Someburros Mexican restaurant across the street and for a fraction of the price our meal was excellent.  We thought that Someburros is where we should have gone to first.  It was just overall better quality of food at a great price.  Too bad, we will miss going to La Parrilla Suiza.  Now we know why both the parking lot and the restaurant were empty. And to the server and manager who just \"blew us off\".  As the old saying goes, \"IF I HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE I WILL TELL 10 PEOPLE, FOR A BAD EXPERIENCE I WILL TELL 1,000\".  Guess which one you fall under..."}
{"text":"Bug in food, followed by terrible handling of the situation. I used to come here on a regular basis however on my most recent visit my friend saw a bug crawling across my plate and pointed it out. I called the waiter over and showed him the bug, he made a sound effect acknowledging that he saw the bug and took the plate away. He then came back a few minutes later with the check and acted as if everything was ok, saying nothing. I was so taken back I paid and got the H out of there ASAP. They made no attempt to fix or even mention the wingless bug we all saw making its way across my plate! Not going back EVER and its a shame because I've been coming here for years! You can't treat customers like that if you expect to run a business successfully. I would have considered coming back but the fact that they made no effort shows that the staff doesn't care at all. That's not okay."}
{"text":"Poor. So poor.  Went on Monday evening with a friend after a movie.  I just wanted a light snack and ordered a fish taco and side of guacamole.  The fish taco was SMELLY and came as a big hunk of greasy, fried, overly salted, frozen piece of pre-made from the grocery isle and was plunked down and did not even fit in the taco. Looked awful, and was SO FREAKING BAD. The guac was OLD.  Seriously,  it had that brown film on the top and smelled like it came from a fridge with no baking soda regimen.   The refried beans from my friend's plate was tasteless and seemed direct from a can, nasty and luke warm- that the topping cheese was not even melted. The host came over and DID NOT ASK ME WHAT WAS WRONG with my plate, just barked \"What else do you want?\"  Yeah...NOTHING.  My friend had a buritto and said it was very average and that she would not be back.  If this place was not located across from the movie theater...it would shut down. Also prices are WAY UP THERE.  Unauthentic Mexican, to say the least except for decor. BAD food. Risk at your own peril."}
{"text":"Since when do they charge you for chips and salsa?! To top it off, ordered a bean and cheese tostada. The waitress returned to inform us that we can't order a tostada because it's on the lunch menu and it's dinner time. We asked to then just order an al a carte tostada (we are at a mexican restaurant right?!). I was then told by the manager that they can't make a tostada (mind you they offer it for lunch) because he doesn't know what to charge. So I suggested he make up a reasonable price as we just want 1 tostada. He said he would make it for us just this once but never again.   Oh great. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious.  We usually go to Popos or the new Anayas. This place has good portions, good food, and not a bad price.  We will definetelly drive a little further for this place."}
{"text":"Poor service, automatic gratuity anyways for party over 6. There are better places to go."}
{"text":"Mexico City Mexican food ...ok...  We were warmly greeted and seated immediately. The interior is much nicer then I expected it to be. We sat in a booth and they brought out the chips quickly. They have three sauces that accompany the chips. One is a coarse chopped pico de gallo and the tomatoes were actually red instead of pink (what a concept), the second was a hot smooth red salsa (my favorite) and the third was a creamy cold avocado dip. The drinks were delivered and they have really clean glasses, no scratches or anything, I notice these things. The water was good, it must be filtered. The silverware was super shiny and looked like it had never been used. I love that!  The menu is a bit different form a traditional Mexican restaurant. I ordered the shrimp melt and my friend ordered the pork flat taco. They are both very similar, but the melt has bacon in it. When the food arrived we were shocked. Where was the greasy gooey all mushed together food we had come to expect with Mexican?? It was on a clean white rectangular plate and was a normal serving, not the massive \"this will make me gain 5 lbs\" size we are used to. I thought everything tasted very good and it was just enough to be full without needing a nap.  I like that this place is not full of screaming children and obnoxious people. Its a grown up Mexican lunch spot."}
{"text":"I like this place I mean it's not the greatest food not the greatest service but it's different just not your normal Taco Burrito enchilada place just a different style which is kind of nice because everyone's the same thing now for the food I had the shrimp soup pretty much can't remember name of it but it was shrimp rice vegetables and like a tomato sauce very good full flavor but freaking boiling hot so watch out and get a side of their grilled or fried jalapenos so delicious definitely will be back"}
{"text":"We met a couple of friends here as a halfway point and will definitely return.  We sat at a booth in the bar (we were the only ones in the bar area) and I was thrilled to see they offered Tacate LIGHT which is a hard find even in most Mexican restaurants!  My husband ordered a margarita which was just okay.  On my girlfriend's recommendation, I ordered the number 48 with chicken..Corn tortillas with chicken, green peppers, onions, and bacon (which at first I thought sounded odd but the flavors together were delicious.)  Their rice and beans were pretty no nonsense but good.  I heard that this is a Little Mexico style type of joint and that their spicy factor is quite low.  The service was pretty good and I thought the prices were fair."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were good. Everything else was no bueno. Filibertos is much better than this sorry restaurant. You'll either puke before digesting the food or have diarrhea after."}
{"text":"My review for this restaurant will be simple and to the point.  As my friend and I entered the establishment, I checked my phone and found it to be exactly 6:15. Why did I check my phone? The intent was purely innocent, I assure you. I suppose it just happened to coincide with my entrance into the restaurant. We chatted between ourselves, both of us being fairly patient individuals, and both of us restaurant workers ourselves, making us doubly more thick skinned to bad experiences.   Minutes pass; we are not greeted or acknowledged by a soul. More minutes pass, we begin to change our posture, to accommodate the awkward transition from entryway to dining table. Finally, an attractive young woman comes up to us with a friendly smile and leads us to our table, located next to the bar. We exchange relieved looks, after both mentally contemplating an exit stage left only moments before. The time is 6:22.  As we take a seat, the restaurant appears to be around 1/4 capacity. The temperature, lighting and music levels are appropriate. We begin to read our menus, becoming much more anticipatory of a good meal after reading some of the descriptions. More time passes, we remain ungreeted by our future server. Finally, the girl who sat us approaches, smile exhausted, and takes our order. Chips and salsa was decent, refills were far and in between. Fast forwarding, our soups arrive. They are out of this world. The Consome de Pollo and Sopa de Tortilla. Much more time passes, our entrees arrive. Both entrees were bland and uninspired, leaving both my friend and I with an empty void in both our stomachs and our wallets. Price was intermediate but overpriced for our experience. Time of exit: 7:45.   I would not recommend La Parrilla Suiza based on our experience. I have talked with many others with the same experiences (slow service and great soups), so I am relieved to find that my often obligatory second visit may be skipped in this particular scenario.  Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Really fresh food, salsas are awesome! I could have made a meal out of them. Cute decor and nice ambiance. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service is awrsome.  I would have given 5 stars but my taco salad was 95% lettuce with no flavor at all.  I had to send it back and get something else.  They have a roasted red pepper sauce that tastes really good.  Definitely a place worth trying."}
{"text":"All I can really say is that it's a family favorite.  My husband's family is completely addicted.  They all have their favorites.  I'm still working my way through the menu but the fried ice cream is always our go to dessert.  And the margaritas are a nice complement to any Mexican meal. :)"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was awful. The chips and salsa were disappointing. You get a trio of salsas but only the green salsa was edible. The red salsa tasted funny and the Pico de Gallo was flavorless. We ordered the queso sulza for an appetizer. It was good, just cheese served with tortilla's. We ordered the #14 and #15 combinations. The beef tacos were just cubed beef on a tortilla. No sauce, no toppings. The Enchiladas were horrible. The sauce tasted like spaghetti-o's sauce. The chicken taco was more like a fajita. It was decent. The other item on that place was extremely bland. It was a piece of chicken on a tortilla with some cheese, topped with another tortilla and more cheese. There was no sauce or Seasoning.  We will not be going back. We didn't even finish our plates and didn't bring the left overs homehttps."}
{"text":"Why am I always starting my reviews with a statement about how long ago I started eating at these places?  I guess I'm gettin old.  Years and years ago I used to eat at the location in Glendale.  We were excited when they opened this location.  It is really good food, friendly service, and they run coupons.    This is a regional Mexican restaurant so expect something different than you ____berto's.  Great with a family and their 3 salsa service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family over the weekend. The food is a washed-out version of mexican food, but edible. The service is just okay. Not anything too exciting to report about this place, but if your in the area and craving some mexican food - this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and sad to say they are CLOSED for good. I loved their tortilla soup the best. But everything was always good. I hope they open a new location on the westside because its too far to drive to Mesa just for soup! Will miss them."}
{"text":"We were going to Red Robin and saw this place in the corner and took a chance, best chance I took all day! The chips are made in house, so are the salsas, the Verde was my favorite. We got there at 5pm and happy hour was until 6pm so, I had to have a margarita...and it was big and only $5 so I had 2! We got the mini chimichanga app, with shredded beef and fresh made guacamole. She had the dinner chimichanga with refried beans and Spanish rice...it was as good as the mini ones but with the added joy of being smothered in cheese. I picked the Enchiladas Con Mole with Spanish rice and churo beans...this fat chic was SO happy!!! This meal was everything you need during \"that time of the month\"...cheesy, crunchy, salty, proteiny, spicy, alcoholic, a lot of it and at a great price!  Oh, our waiter was cute, called me sweety and made us feel at home. And the beautiful glasses and light fixtures that are all made in Mexico make everything feel festive. We had a wonderful dinner and will definitely be returning  for more."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim.  The salsa had a bite to it so when I ordered the 2 mini chimichangas I was really looking forward to it. I got  a plate of blah. No spice in the refried beans or the rice.  But I was really disappointed in the chimichangas which were tasteless.  Bur the service was great and everyone was very friendly"}
{"text":"We came with a group of 8, including two young children.  The staff was very attentive and efficient.  The food, meh.  It wasn't awful, but definitely not great.  The drinks were mediocre, too.  It worked out okay for a larger party without a wait, but I'd choose another spot if we weren't thinking about the kids being served quickly."}
{"text":"Great Mexico city Mexican.  Love happy hour here.  For dinner try the fish tacos or shrimp tacos.  Everything is great.  wonderful atmosphere great staff. Love this place.  I'm a regular."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's very good food for decent price, the red sauce on the enchiladas were BOMB!  A very good place to eat on this side of town!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews of this restaurant's other locations, I am at a complete loss for words -- is this supposed to be some great local gem or something? What it seemed like to me was a big old Mexican chain restaurant full of overpriced cheddar-filled enchiladas. It wasn't *bad* food, but it was unremarkable. I came here for lunch and was seated promptly. The chips and salsa were quite tasty. I was surprised to see the prices on the lunch menu, though -- $10-$11 for vegetarian dishes like cheese enchiladas or a veggie burrito seemed really high. I went with the burrito, enchilada style. It tasted good. The tortilla was a bit chewy but the veggies were nice.  Ok. That's it. I get that this is supposed to be \"Mexican city\" style food, whatever that means. I didn't really notice that it had unique flavors to Mexico city, or any other region of Mexico, for that matter. Sigh.  I STILL haven't found a fantastic Mexican restaurant in this city of, what, 5 million people? I'm getting really frustrated. It's been three years! On to the next one..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to find the overall rating for La Parrilla Suiza is so low.  But, then again, I don't live in Phoenix and I only come here once a year when I'm visiting...AND i always order the same thing (the Parrilla Suiza in the table grill).    I love this place for the ability to get amazing, fresh mexico-city style meals.  Note, NOT TEX MEX.  The salsa is pretty good to start, but nothing to write home about.  What I truly crave anytime I get in the greater Phoenix area is the chorizo at La Parrilla Suiza.  Awesome, just awesome.  Again, I highly recommend one of the table grill options where you get chorizo, a couple quesadillas, seasoned beef, and a poblano pepper stuffed with cheese.  I'm currently chewing on the side of my keyboard right now just thinking of it.   See you next year La Parrilla Suiza!"}
{"text":"I don't speak Spanish so I'm not sure that my girlfriend's translation of La Parilla Suiza to English as \"Our food tastes like when you throw up in the back of your mouth\" is correct. We had some chicken enchiladas with green sauce on the recommendation of our server. Being a gringo I expect my enchilada to be a corn tortilla filled with some gooey melted cheese and if ordered with, some meat. These were corn torts with a dab of chicken inside them, topped with a green sauce that had no heat but a lot of twang. Though given the flavor of the enchiladas I was happy that there wasn't much there.  As for the service, we didn't see him again after the food was delivered until done and ready for the check. The carafe of water left on the table appeared to be a Star Trek collectible as it had food particle klingons. But hey, no server to complain to so I guess all is good."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to this resturant when we're in the area. They have excellent service & the food is delicious! I especially enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would give it 1 1/2 because only because the service was ok. First we order a appetizer and when it came out it was just cheese melted in a pan now it was good cheese but still just cheese , before we ordered this we asked our waiter what it was and since he barely spoke english and I mean not really at all he could explain what it was. Then The food came out we ordered the chimichagas it came with jalepeno cream cheese and melted cheese on the top. I liked it and the rice was good but I have had better. I gave it such low star rating because the food was not authentic mexican food. I would not go here again even with a coupon."}
{"text":"You know its good mexican food when the place is packed with Mexican people! Lol... Fenominal food, great service and ambiance. A piece of Mexico in AZ. Family friendly and great friendly choices."}
{"text":"Yum! We had a mail coupon for buy one entree get one free, so figured what the hell and gave this place a try.  It's located in a strip mall, but certainly doesn't feel like it when you are inside. It has quite authentic decorating, is clean, and VERY welcoming. It feels like being in a family restaurant with a cozy feel in Mexico. We were seated instantly. We had the best service here I have EVER had. Not exaggerating. Jovan was our server and was amazingly fast, efficient, friendly, and motivated. Our drinks were always full, food was out in a flash and just how we had ordered it. He was amazing. Always smiling- all of the customers appeared content and relaxed. Onto the food here- spectacular! It seemed quite authentic. It was hot, great flavoring, and the menu is large and diverse. They give chips with 3 types of salsa that were all very different, but wonderful. I saw quite a few people order the \"fajitas for 2\", which were huge and presented well.  I really highly recommend coming here for lunch or dinner. Comforting feel and absolutely perfect service.  I have still been raving about it."}
{"text":"Just got seated. 3 dirty tables in view, lots of staff coming and going, none seem concerned about it. Told hostess about it as she seated me, still no concern.  Drove 7 miles from Tempe for this? Waited 8-10 minutes before someone stopped at my table to see if I've been helped. Ready to leave even before I order.  But I want . Hopefully they redeem themselves."}
{"text":"First time here but confused about the bad reviews. Some people are just too hard to please I guess. Service was excellent and everything on my plate was robust with flavor. I had the Mar Y Tierra which was pretty damn good. The charro beans had some awesome spices I couldn't quite peg. The salsa trifecta was VERY good. I'll be coming back next time in town. I enjoyed the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus! This was the blandest, poorly served Mexican food in the valley. The meat in the \"mixta\" was a unflavored mess. The waitress saw we ate very little and could of cared less. Old Taco Bell leftovers would have been a treat compared to this experience."}
{"text":"Overall, not that impressive. 3 stars is generous. The lunch specials are very reasonably priced. The portion sizes are decent. But the food is overall just bland the refried beans have no flavor their salsa as weak and mild not sure what the Swiss influence on Mexico was but it's pretty weak. The service is only so so the waiter never came back after bringing our food they have no hot salsa. They advertise a military discount on their website and then don't honor it. And for that reason alone I will not return. And I hate the Yelp. I refuse to rate the Yelp app even though they keep nagging and nagging and nagging me"}
{"text":"People who think this isn't authentic has never been to Mexico City. I had the #15. The combination of beef, onion, bacon & green peppers is delicious & worth the price of the dish by itself. My mother ordered the chicken soup, & they certainly didn't skimp on the chicken. It was tasty. The restaurant was busy, but server Luis was constantly attentive, great service & great suggestions of what to order. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had dinner there, very colorful place at first, seemed like it'd be good. They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and I'm not sure what that's all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didn't find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didn't hinder the waitress. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was very good! It was super cray because of it being cinco de mayo! We were seated rapidly and our server was very nice!  The chips are to die for because they make them there fresh. The guac is spicy, the red salsa tastes like canned salsa, and the pico de gallo can be spicy as well!  We waited about 15 minutes for our entrees to arrive which is not bad because they were super busy! Our food was really good, everything tasted great, and our server was on top of his game! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this place Siempre que voy a Phoenix no puedo regresar sin haber ido a comer aqui primero. Es nuestro lugar de reunion familiar. Great food. Great service.  I can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to dine at! Service is always great, food is delicious, and the atmosphere is wonderful. Cesar and Enrique are the best!"}
{"text":"Best salsa in town, I've been eating here for 10 years and I always order #34 chicken melt- there was a time where they started cooking it a weird way so I stopped going, but just recently started going back and they went back to their old ways so Im excited to be eating at my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"I just walked in--OK 15 minutes now--from Birthday Meal. I hadn't eaten at LPS in years; we haven't gone out to dinner in months, for that matter. I don't know why all the planets aligned, but my meal was incredible. I got the Shrimp Enchiladas, which were good. Red sauce pleasantly spicy. But what really took my breath away was the simple but delicious cole slaw and the rice. I always love a good Mex rice, and LPS' looked really good. But mine was white--and saturated with chicken taste. Moist, yet still the correct consistency for rice, and fantastic. Good stuff, and a fair price."}
{"text":"We traveled far to eat here sine the one in Paradise Valley closed. Try the #17 or the #15 those combos are great."}
{"text":"What happened, I've been coming here for years, this trip wasn't my favorite, I ordered # 48 the chicken tacos and it comes with a side of rice and side of beans, I always loved their beans because they were always creamy and had a taste to them, like they used bacon lard, well today didn't have a taste at all needed salt or something or I should have dumped one of their hot salsas in their to make it taste like something, and while I'm on the subject of their salsas, holy cow all three of them were hot, didn't use to be like that, couldn't even enjoy the chips and salsa, what a let down. Not sure what happened here."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the food.  I havent been to a La Parrilla Suiza since I left Tucson in 93 and I had hoped this would be what I remembered.  I even drove way out of the way just to have good experience but it was not good.  It was pretty bland and boring.  The chips were good and the service was o.k. even though the server forgot the beans I ordered but after I got the food had a couple bites I was already over it and didnt care about the beans anymore.  Wish I could find a good Mexican joint!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch, which is perfect. Not noisy. Daniel was our server and the service he gave us was exceptional.  i had the pachuga poplano, it was very good. The chips were hot and the salsas were delicious. The rice could look a little more appealing but it was good anyway. The chicken melt is always a favorite of my husbands. The charro beans are wonderful. If you have out of town company and looking for good Mexican food, bring them here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Been there for lunch a couple of times. The first time I was not impressed, and rather neutral about the experience. But I thought it was because I was on the phone w/ biz the entire time.   Went last week w/ a few folks from my office. Omg! We were thoroughly disappointed. Let's start w/ the chips and salsa. They serve a complementary salsa trio. Red, green and pico de gallo. The traditional salsa was borderline gross! No flavor and funky texture. The salsa verde was ok but not great. I asked for hot salsa....they didn't have one. Huh??!   The food was par at best and the service was worse! The restaurant was not busy and we had to search for our server for any and everything. We had to ask for our check and 15 min later, she still hadn't come to collect the bill. Tick Tock! Tick Tock! C'mon lady....I've got stuff to do!!! I had to take the credit card to her!!!   The icing on the cake was my asking for a to-go cup for my freshly poured iced tea. She brought me a soup container!! No thanks!   Meh! I'm cool on this place!"}
{"text":"Our go to place when we have a craving for Mexico City style Mexican food.  The salsas are really good especially the green one.  Food is fresh  and tasty.  Service has always been friendly and the manager always is near by to see that all goes well.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of La Parrilla Suiza for over 20 years.  I absolutely LOVE this place.  However, this location was not good AT ALL!  First, they lacked in customer service.  The waiter did not introduce himself and sat us a dirty table.  When I asked for a towel to wipe down the booth, he caught attitude and did it for me.  You sit at a dirty table then?!?!  Secondly, my sister wanted to order a ground beef Chimi.  We were told they do not offer a Chimi in ground beef, but they do have ground beef tacos.  Later when I spoke with the Manager, he tried explaining that they only make a certain amount of ground beef that they reserve for tacos only.  That was my sign that our food was not fresh.  When she took a bite, I could see the disgust all over her face.  She immediately stated that the ground beef tasted old.  As for my order, I ALWAYS get the table grill with sliced steak, 2 cheese quesadillas, cheese bell pepper and Chorizo.  First, the Chorizo immediately looked dried out.  I'm born and raised in Arizona, I know what freshly cooked Chorizo looks like and that wasn't it.  Lastly, how do you bring out a hot table grill, but the sliced steak is cold to the touch.  I was not only shocked, but pissed and disappointed at this time because I was really craving my favorite dish and it was not up to my liking.  The waiter had the nerve to smile because I was unhappy about the look of my food.  I didn't see NOTHING funny at all.  They offered to take it back (I figured to put it back on the grill or in the microwave), but I was not initially excited about getting food not freshly prepared for me.  Would you pay $18 for a skillet that comes out cold and old?  I THINK NOT!  Neither will I.  I will drive all the way to Tucson and visit La Parilla Suiza there before I ever come back to this location.  You ought to be ashamed at yourselves."}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food snob, I'm from Texas where we have AMAZING Mexican food (Mom and pop places, taco trucks, etc)   Since moving to Arizona in November I've eaten at about 7-8 places and each one has disappointed me until I came here.   It's the simple things, the environment is simple and makes you feel like you're at home, they play Mexican music which helps you enjoy the environment. The food was phenomenal. Authentic, not that \"New Mexican\" stuff that I've found everywhere else.   I'm going to definitely eat here again, it's not quite what we have back home, but it's close enough and it's very good."}
{"text":"I've been to this location on 3 different occasions. Within a 2 yr time frame. I've not been impressed with the food or service. This is why it's taken me this long to write a review. The food and service was ok on my first visit. Nothing memorable. The 2nd time the service was horrible the waiters argued with our group about a platter that was not order but someone in the group asked about. She took it back but after that the waiters neglected to check on us. On this last visit the service was great. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered fish tacos which I figured you can't go wrong at a Mexican restaurant. WRONG! I received a taco with flavorless frozen fish stick. The fish stick was luke warm and the tortillas were cold which was weird because the tortillas were suppose to be made fresh. The white rice was delicious, very tasty buttery garlic flavor. My son had cheese enchiladas which he liked but there was a plastic container upside down and he did not realize he was suppose to remove to get the rice.  My cousin ordered chilaciles, she loved them, she said they were her favorite. They also had the steak parillada and they like it. The best thing about lunch was desert: flan, fried ice cream and sopapilla. I will not be returning here but enter at your own risk it can go either way."}
{"text":"I read the reviews for this place here on Yelp and took my husband there who is VERY picky when it comes to Mexican food.  He told me that we pass the place all the time and there are no cars.  Sure enough, The lot was empty but the food was amazing.  We both loved it.  And me being vegetarian, they had a section of the menu for me.  I have not had fajitas in SO long and these were to die for.  The mushrooms were cooked to perfection.  Slightly sweet.  And the corn was perfect.  Grilled but still had a slight crunch.  And how can i leave without having Sopapillas.  Again.  Great stuff.  I give it 5 stars and have decided to make it our Sunday treat.  Thanx all for recommending this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"I am here in Phoenix on Vacation and was told to visit this place. I am 100% Mexican, and I must say there is nothing \"Authentic\" about this place. The food was horrible, they couldn't make a simple Chicken Quesadilla. We had a party of 6, and not a single person liked their food. We paid $60 and only took two bites. Their silverware was dirty, there was a bug in one of the drinks. I'm not a picky eater or a person who likes to complain, but for the rating this place had we were all expecting a whole lot more. Never, ever coming back. I suggest you don't waste your time either."}
{"text":"Great Great food. could not be better. Service was possibly a little slower but they made up for it with a great attitude and fantastic food."}
{"text":"I had originally seen the other listing for this Restaurant which had the place rated at four stars rather than 2.75; and after being there I wish I would have seen this one first.  2.75 stars is the perfect place for the ratings to rest - La Parrilla Suiza is lackluster, tolerable Mexican food at it's best.  To be fair - the staff is extremely nice and attentive.  Being a Sunday early afternoon it was imperative that my water was replenished frequently and it was.  Our waitress was great!  The food itself was pretty good as well - I ordered an enchilada and had the tortilla soup which was very good.    The part that knocks a plausible four stars down to three is the lack of character in the restaurant - it's just a big, open, area with vaguely Mexican-oriented decorations.  The pricing was average for Americanized places - ranging from about $9.50 - $14.00 a plate.    There is a full bar which I would have definitely taken advantage of had it not been a Sunday and the beers been less than $4.50 a piece.    Overall - If it's not too out of your way and you're in a bind, La Parrilla Suiza won't be the worst choice.  I'd much rather head to either an authentic place like Salazar Brothers or a slightly more upscale place like El Zocalo."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Friday for dinner.  My husband and I always drove by this place and had seen cars packed in the parking lot near this restaurant and thought it might be a good stop to eat at.  We walked in and noticed a nice decor.  We weren't expecting to much walking in but the atmosphere was pretty nice.  They had a huge wait staff waiting for diners to come in.  The place for being prime time dinner time on a Friday night was pretty empty.  I liked it cause we got sat right away.  The booths are really comfortable, very soft and relaxing.  Our waiter came right over to take our order.  We felt like a margarita or two, or three so we ordered a pitcher to start.  Looking over the menu it looked as if they would have some pretty good food so I thought we stumbled on to a nice place.  We ordered the fish taquitto for an app.  The margarita came out and it was perfect, exactly how I make mine at home so I was happy.  The app was served and I was like, What????  It was one taquitto sliced in three pieces, not even enough for one person to enjoy, way to small for a $9 app.  I was very disappointed.  We tried it and it wasn't good either.  The fish I swore said salmon on the menu, and we got some sort of white fish I can't even figure out with no flavor.  bummer....   We both ordered some sort of combo they had.  I got the beef taco's, and enchilada.  My taco's really reminded me of the authentic Mexican taco's I've gotten down in Mexico, you know the smaller ones.  It came with a side of pinto beans, and rice.  My enchilada wasn't anything special, the taco's were a little bland.  My opion would be you can go through any drive through Mexican taco shop and get the same quality food for 1/2 the price of this place.  If it weren't for the margarita lifting my spirits I would have been very bummed about the price we paid for our dinner."}
{"text":"I work nights and this place has great food when I get off work, I try to make it twice a week. I come for the food but I stay until they close because of the bartender Tony. No matter how busy the place is I always feel like I'm the only person at the bar. Fast and friendly service and he makes a killer margarita."}
{"text":"I only give this place 3 stars because our waiter was really nice. The salsa's were not spicy and in need of salt. The Fajitas were so-so. The Flan looked gross. My Margarita was like a slush.  There has to be better Mexican food out there!  Oh, but the corn tortillas were really good."}
{"text":"La Parilla Suiza is one of my local faves. I probably go there about monthly - sometimes more, sometimes less. The food is great and reasonably proced.   I understand there are several, but I've only been to this one. I like the environment. The kitchen has a large window and you can watch some of the preparation. The wait staff is always very friendly. A few times they've even had mariachis playing table to table.   They use a lot of white cheeses, which I really like. I don't order the typical mexican tacos and enchiladas here, so I can't rate them, but the main entrees are really good. I'm a big fan of the Champignones Suizos - a mushroom and cheese appetizer. I've had the chilaquiles, chicken melt, parillada de pollo, and others, and always like them. I really like the churro beans - it's more of a Pinto soup than the typical refried beans. I've not tried the mole, but my son who likes mole enjoys theirs.   The price is good. I never wait long. The facility is good. The service is great. The food is great. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is right in my neighborhood, but I always seem to forget it's there! Finally tried it out last night and I was very impressed. I LOVED the trio of salsas they serve with their chips...especially the green one! It is fantastic and so flavorful. I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce, and they were delicious. Normally enchiladas come drowning in cheese, but these one were not and you could really taste the flavor of the enchilada sauce. Their charro beans were very good as well; definitely a nice alternative to refried beans. I can't wait to go back here and try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"We love La Parilla Suiza for good Mexican food that is as close to Tex-Mex as it gets!  The Salsas are all good, especially the green tomatillo variety.  I love their mini chimichangas and enchiladas.  Both of which are always on point. Overall, this place does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been going since I was a kid (I moved away but I'm back now) and I thought maybe my travels and eating \"good food\" would change my opinion of this place...nope!  Their salsa is so good, their food is wonderful.  I love their beef machaca and their fajitas are ridiculous.    If you want good, legit mexian food come here.    This place also has the best high chairs for kids (random thing I know).  I love places that actually invest in good things for family dining..."}
{"text":"OK, we went in to this restaurant with high expectations seeing the Yelp reviews were pretty good.  This was another typical Meh!  The salsa and chips were great. the rice and beans were really well seasoned and moist (I have dry rice) so they hit that out of the park.  My tacos though were so gross. I don't know what it is about the concept that placing ground beef inside a corn tortilla and frying it in a pan is a good thing??? This was a TOTAL turn off for me (get out the Alka-Seltzer)  I might try going back at some time and trying the enchiladas but with all the other mexican joints around Gilbert it probably won't be any time soon..."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this restaurant. Nice atmosphere and the bartender is awesome! Will be back and bring friends. Food was delicious and very flavorful...."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of this place because I am normally not a fan of strip center Mexican food places.  This location isn't the newest and nicest but it is definitely a solid joint and far exceeded my expectations.    Our server/waiter was fast, friendly and courteous.  The chips and salsas brought to the table when you sit down were fresh and excellent.  I especially loved loved loved the red one.  I bought a pint to take home to put on EVERYTHING.  There is just enough spice and great flavor.  There is some secret ingredient but I can't place it.  We also ordered the melted cheese thing for an appetizer and it was awesome cheesy goodness.  Next time we are going to order it with green chilies.    My wife and I split the \"Fajitas for 2\" with 1/2 chicken and 1/2 steak.  I thought it was excellent.  The meat was tender and juicy and there were plenty of sauteed onions and peppers throughout.  There was also more than enough for 2 people.  The flour tortillas were also fresh and delicious.  Their guacamole was less than stellar however.  This is probably one of my favorite local Mexican places and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Service was good but the rice tasted burnt and the red sauce taste like they put tomato soup on my burrito. Their red salsa also had a little of the soup taste as well. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite spot but it has gone downhill tremendously. Myself and my sisters boyfriend both ordered the fish tacos that said they came with a few different sauces on them. What we received was a dry lump of fish sitting in a tortilla. When I asked why we didn't get any of the sauces that the menu claimed it came with, the waitresses response was \"that's not on the menu..\" Ummm excuse me? Ok then! Staff is not trained well, drinks are EXPENSIVE and food is low quality especially for the price. I now know why it's never packed anymore!"}
{"text":"After giving this place a second try, I didn't find it any better than the first.  The food itself is okay, average Mexican food for what you find in Arizona.  Both times, the experience was lacking. Our waitress barely spoke English, and couldn't understand either of my parents. The set up is awkward for diners with wheelchairs (my mother) and made it hard to maneuver around, especially when there was a server taking an order at another table.   The bathroom, both this time and last was disgusting."}
{"text":"Great looking place, expected a really classy experience.  What we got was a waitress who didn't introduce herself or greet us, clear our plates or fill our drinks.  What we also got was food that would have been just slightly above average had it actually been hot.  The food was lukewarm, refried beans had a burned taste, chips were stale, the fried ice cream was obviously fried a few days ago so it pretty much just looked like a big ball of ice cream that had been rolled in cornflakes.  Not to mention we didn't get the extra garnishes the table next to us got.  We won't be going back, there are way too many other places that are worth the money."}
{"text":"I have been here about 3 times already, usually it's really good just last night I went and it was slow and I always order the American Sirloin al Carbon witch s really good and i ordered it Medium and they brought it out well done witch was really dry, service was good I didn't bring up anything witch I should of but  I already started to eat so I felt bad and didn't mention anything. Other than that place is really good when done right, chips and salsa are really great and deep fried ice cream is amazing for dessert"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for 29 years. They treat me like family. The waiters are friendly and very helpful. The food is delicious! I try to get something different every time and it is all good. My favorites are the fajitas, crispy tacos and combination plates. For dessert, nothing is better than a deep fried icecream. I now live in San Diego and its a must go every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wow.  If it was possible to give a place negative stars, I would have.  I purchased a gift certificate for this restaurant on restaurant.com.  My husband and I took our three small children there on Saturday night.  The hostess looked annoyed that she had to seat us.  Once at the table, three waiters passed us by without asking what we wanted to drink, etc.  Once we had been there for about 6 minutes, a bus boy brought us some salsa.  He asked if we knew about the salsa and I said no, we hadn't eaten there in years.  His response was \"oh it's the same\" which didn't explain anything at all.  We continued to sit for another 10 minutes or so, with no drinks, and thirsty children as waiter after waiter passed us by.  The table that got seated 30 seconds before us got their food and we still hadn't been served even a glass of water.  At this point, we left.  On my way out, I decided I should talk to a manager.  The bartender got him for me.  As he was coming to the front, he refused to make eye contact with me, and actually passed me right by and was chatting with the hostess at the station.  When I said \"excuse me!\" he turned and said \"yeah.\"  I explained to him what happened and that we were leaving and his response was to turn to me, gesture to the restaurant and say \"the restaurant is full, you think you make a difference?  I have never been so insulted in my life.  I would never return to this restaurant, and I would never ever recommend it to anyone.  What a disaster.  The customer sevice sucks, the manager is an ass, and the entire experience was a total joke."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place because I have been a fan of their restaurants in Tucson, AZ.  I had the chicken tacos which were good and the charro beans were excellent too.  Not too much bad to say about this place...the food is great and it is right near work so a good place to go.  You wont find great service here but the food out weighs that expereince by far."}
{"text":"Used to eat at the Craycroft location in Tucson back in the day.  Driivng around Gilbert I spot THIS location and prevail upon Spousal Unit to try it - completely against our Policy of \"Locally owned/operated Only\"!!!  Chips fresh, salsa trio fresh & tasty... BUT........mi amigos, this is AZ how can you NOT have a hot salsa available?    Handcrafted margarita to order Great!  Service outstanding, she was a true professional.  Fajitas Great. Shrimp Diablo (has some other name on their menu that I cannot recall) was really good.....BUT.....NOT \"spicy hot\" as expected.  Overall solid performance except for the disappointing tourist level Spice Index - if I\"m not crying and sweating halfway thru the meal you didn't go all the way!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican places I have ever been too all they serve is fake not freshly made we walked out very unhappy"}
{"text":"Had a coupon from a mail clipper for $5 or something like that and went here with the family. The food was terrible. No flavor. We all ordered something different and we all were disappointed with our meal. It was super dead, not sure how long this place will stay in business. Not a particularly horrible experience, but this place needs serious help with it's menu/recipes. Never again."}
{"text":"My husband and I chose this place for our anniversary dinner, having just moved into the neighborhood and wanting to find a Mexican restaurant to frequent. This will not be it.  The food was disappointing, with the red sauce tasting like Chef Boyardee and the rice like Rice a Roni Spanish rice.  Then our server, Ivan, was mia for most of the evening, forgetting us it would seem for over twenty minutes after we asked for boxes and the check.  It's kind of a dark place, even though there are a lot of windows.   There was lots of smoke from the kitchen as they must burn a lot of meat. I definitely left smelly smoky and hate that.  And their soda tasted off, like they weren't using real coke products.  Needless to say, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best appetizer in the city.  Me and my family have been eating here since they opened, and that was around 20 some years ago.  Without fail we have always had the melted cheese appetizer.  It's a combination of a few types of cheese served in two different sizes depending on how much you want.  Let's make this clear.  This stuff is a heart attack in a hand pressed tortilla.  It probably takes years off your life but the taste is worth it.    Perhaps it goes along with the tradition of melted cheese but I dont think I have ever ordered anything other than the bistek tacos.  I will admit I think they used to be better but I still they think they are quite good.  There is better mexican food in the valley that I am sure of, however between the personnel tradition and the melted cheese appetizer this place is still one of my favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Comforting Mexican food at its best.  Awesome service / management.  Saw the guy they brought over from the now-closed PV location.  Many great experiences there over the years.  I wish they would open one up near us again...  It's just that kinda place that's comfortable and brutally delicious!  It's not your typically burritos and chimichangas... if you want sonoran-style Mexican, try Rosita's Place.     This is quite different.  The best analogy I can think of is comparing Carraba's to Olive Garden.  Both are Italian, but they're not remotely the same food... not that either of those chains is in the same league as this place food-wise."}
{"text":"La Parilla Suiza has been a restaurant that we've gone to for a long time in our family. Though we don't go as frequently, I believe the service and food seems to have slipped a bit.  The first thing that your MUST order when going is the \"Queso Suizo\" which is absolutely mouth watering amazing. Definitely a favorite when we go, and has and will always be delicious. Luckily, you get complimentary chips and salsas (green one is my fav), so that'll keep you busy before your huge plate arrives.   Their combination plates are pretty good, not too much a fan of their charro beans, but their chicken enchiladas and arroz are very tasty. Their chicken is always grilled very yummy, their fajita plate is veeeery tasty. Make sure to ask for extra green salsa for your food, it's a must."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for 15 years, and I always get the same thing, the Chicken Melt. It is chicken, cheese, tomatoes, avacado, and bacon melted on a crispy tortilla, I love it. It also comes with yummy charro beans. Some of the servers are slow but it's worth the wait. They have a large window looking into the kitchen, that's always a plus."}
{"text":"Food was okay. The service was 6/10. Came in for a birthday party of 15, so I understand it's a bit hectic, but we did make reservations ahead of time so they can make preparations. The biggest issue was we asked for our check to be split at the beginning while ordering and when we asked for the check it was Not split. Good luck to anyone that gives it a try, and don't come in with more than 2 people..."}
{"text":"The consome de pollo AKA chicken with rice soup is outstanding. We wish the one in PV was still open. The service is amazing! The restaurant is super clean. The beans are superb! I love the carne asada, green chili chicken enchiladas and the orange rice! Everything about the restaurant is great! Come try La Parrilla Suiza!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't as good as I hoped. I got chicken enchiladas with red sauce. The sauce tasted like something you could get in a can at any grocery store and the enchilada filling was mediocre at best. Really just boring. My dad ordered something that looked like a pile of melted cheese with chili on top. He loved it, but I thought it looked disgusting. I'm still not sure what it was that he ordered. The best part of the meal for me was the chips and salsa beforehand. The green sauce/salsa was very good and the chips were nice and fresh with just the right amount of salt.  The service was fine. Neither terrible nor amazing. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but mine was not very hot (still warm, but barely). Can't comment on my Dad's plate, as he didn't mention anything about the temperature.  I would probably give this place another shot sometime to see if maybe I was just there on an off-day."}
{"text":"eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions."}
{"text":"I am originally from Tucson, and this is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant.  While I still believe that the Tucson locations are better, this is still a pretty good representation.  I must warn everyone that this is NOT Sonoran-style mexican food, nor is it anything close to Tex-Mex.  This is Mexico City style cuisine, which is something that is hard to come by this far north.  Do yourself a favor and try something other than the dishes you are used to.  The mixed grill is a favorite (#39), as is the chicken melt (#34), and the pechuga suiza (like a chicken quesadilla) is to die for (#32).  My all-time favorite dish though is a combination plate, with two tacos and the pechuga suiza (#15).  The tortilla soup is also very good.  One problem that I have come across with this location is the service.  Multiple times I have been sat by the hostess and failed to be greeted by a server for 10-15 mins.  Other than that, I love this restaurant.  I grew up eating at the Tucson location, and it was the first place I would want to go to when I would come home from college during holidays."}
{"text":"Horrible, tasteless meal. I ordered a chicken Caesar's salad, and received iceberg lettuce which wasn't fresh, sprinkled with black olives out of a can, which were rinsed in water, and were tasteless. No cheese. A small side of store bought Caesar dressing. Stale croutons. Also ordered an enchilada which was awful. $35.00! A real rip off. I will never patronize this restaurant again. Stay away. So many better Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"By far our favorite place!!  Come here often, friendly staff, great food- nuff said"}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to give restaurants bad reviews because many times bad reviews are just odd occurrences. La Parrilla Suiza; however, not only failed to deliver quality service, but the food was a nightmare. I ordered a water, two fish tacos, and a side of rice; a simple order for most Mexican restaurants. It took close to 45 minutes for a waitress to get me my water even after I repeatedly asked for it. My food was delivered after an hour and a half and it matched the services quality, which was horrendous. My fish tacos consisted of a cold tortilla, one fish stick per taco, lettuce, and avocados (which I asked to have removed). It was such a joke I just ate the fish sticks with my hands. The rice was the only thing that was mediocre. My meal experience was poor as was the guests around me, who routinely waited over an hour for the meals only to be presented with sub-par food.   Overall the service was incredibly disorganized and poor and the food was worse than what a four year old with an EZ-bake oven could make."}
{"text":"At one time I was lucky enough to live only 3 miles from La Parriila Suiza. This has to be THE best Mexican joint I've ever been to and I make it a point to eat there when I get back to Phoenix. \"QUESO ESPECIAL\" started it all. VERY friendly staff and authentic Mexican atmosphere make this place great for lunch and dinner.  If I still lived 3 miles away, I'd be tipping the scales @ 300+...."}
{"text":"Wow!!  This place turned out to be a delicious surprise for my husband and I!  This is not the same generic Mexican food you get at many restaurants around the east valley.  It is Mexico City style and almost everything has a bold, homemade taste.  They have great vegetarian options as well.  High points:  The cheese and shredded beef quesadilla appetizer... my husband said it was the best he has had (and he orders quesadillas everywhere!).  The chile relleno... oh my gosh, where do I begin?!  The chile was huge and flavorful.  The cheese and egg complimented it well but the star was the sauce.  I have not had any sauce like this rich, peppery, buttery delicious sauce that was slathered over the chile.  It was perfection!   The atmosphere was colorful and relaxed.  You can watch the kitchen staff make your meal through a long set of windows.  It seems very clean.  Service could be a little more happy but they still did their jobs well.    Don't let the mediocre salsas that they serve at the beginning of the meal fool you. The appetizers and entrees are worth every penny!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food served is authentic Mexican City style. I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back. I loved their green avocado salsa!!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place for 7 years now. Always get the number 15. Love the salsa selection. Good environment, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a kid and I must say they have gone downhill over the last several years. The last visit was pretty mediocre in service and food however my most recent visit (today) has convinced me to stop going back. We ordered a cheese crisp that took a good 10+ minutes to come out and it was charred when it finally arrived. The waiter sent for a new one that was out in less than 5 minutes. Why it took so long this first time? No idea but clearly they could get it out much faster when they're trying. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas with light sauce and I got the carne asada quesadilla. When the food came to the table his enchiladas were SMOTHERED in sauce and mine was entirely too salty I could not take more than 3 bites. The server took my plate and we let him know the enchiladas were loaded with sauce when we ordered light sauce. My boyfriend had only eaten one bite of his food. The server came back with the bill and had removed the quesadilla but left the enchiladas on the ticket. We paid and left, still hungry after paying a $40 tab. I have worked MANY years in food service and in my opinion, if a table complains a manager should AUTOMATICALLY stop at the table and do damage control. We watched the manager stand around doing very little the whole time we were there so clearly she wasn't too busy to stop and visit with us to make sure we left happy. Very poorly handled, and unfortunately they have lost a lifelong customer."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at the restaurant with two friends.  We all had good times eating and talking.  We were there for almost three hours.  The food was good.  The prices was very reasonable.  We were there to celebrate my Birthday.  The only thing is that the waitress was not happy to be there and to serve us.  She looked grumpy.  I think that the restaurant needs to educate their waitresses and waiters about the Joy of Serving the Customers.  I would recommend this restaurant as long as the waitress is happy, and everything would be fine."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona from Las Vegas and I came down to this restaurant, my family and I enjoy the food here it's very delicious. If I ever come back to Arizona I'm diffidently coming here I recommend people to come try this out. Thank you for everything."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and the pricing was very fair. Place was very clean. I would not hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Omg we love this place. Staff is so nice and friendly.  Have never regretted anything we've ordered. Although we have our favorites!!  Chicken tortilla soup is so good. One of my favorite places to take people who are visiting."}
{"text":"I'm pregnant and craving Mexican.  I hadn't been to this restaurant in years and decided to give it another try.  Being on a budget, I didn't have that much to spend on lunch for my boyfriend and I.  First thing that turned me off was printed in the menu.  Only 1 refill of the chips and salsa before they charged $1.99 for more.  Also, only 1 refill on drinks (which were absurdly expensive for iced tea and lemonade: $2.25 each).  Any restaurant that charges that much for drinks and limits your refills to 1 turns me off, especially here in the desert.  My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with \"mole\" sauce.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  Decent, but not worth $10.49 they charged for simple enchiladas.  The chips were nothing to write home about, honestly a Fry's bag of $1 would have been much more appealing.  The salsa (a trio of regular, green and hot) was bland and tasteless, albeit spicy (which didn't help my sudden need to suck down the limited drink I had ordered).  I am reliving the food even now as it gave me horrible heartburn and left me feeling extremely nauseas.  I will never be going back, ever again."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had. Their chips and salsas are great! They serve three types at a time. Another big plus ia their service is FAST. After you order you blink and there is your food! My favorite place to eat :)"}
{"text":"Never even made it to order and try the food before my four year old noticed bugs of some sort on the window sill to the kitchen I'm completely disgusted and will never even try this place ... There's never a good reason for bugs it's just unacceptable"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix. Serving authentic menu items for years, always with a complimentary assortment of fresh salsas.  They have six locations in Arizona. I have been to 5 of the 6, all very good, but I prefer the quality of the location on Peoria Ave in Phoenix and the Ina Road location in Tucson. But all of their locations serve really good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, it was simply awful. I ordered fish tacos. all four people in our party were put off. everything was so bland and then the sauces were so hot. been there twice, it was awful so it's pointless to try a third time. sad, the wait staff are awesome and the place is cute and the drinks are strong. I will never go again."}
{"text":"Wow! I never reviewed La Parrilla before? We go there very often, usually for dinner, since they always have coupons going on for the neighborhood....  We usually have one or two of the parrilladas, which are usually always enough to share.  I like their green (avocado like) salsa, and their staff is always so nice and friendly.  Today we were in a hurry (we only had 30 minutes) and we ordered just an appetizer (chorizo quesadilla) to share, it was just the right size snack.  I really love the cheese they use, the quesadilla was delicious, as always is the queso fundido that comes with the parrillada.  The only complaint is that the hubby thinks they don't have diet coke, but Coke Zero... not sure though, but he always thinks the Diet Coke tastes funny : )"}
{"text":"Salsas, melted cheese and service, 4 stars. Chips... 3  Food was good, but only 3 stars because... I went there with a vegetarian friend and they have some vegetarian options... but... the veggie fajitas he ordered come with beans that we were told are made with bacon!!  That does not make any sense at all...  Also, beans are a good source of protein and I believe any Mexican restaurant should have vegetarian bean burrito option."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for over 20 years. Only order one thing. Beef fajitas. Won't eat fajitas anywhere else.  Although this restaurant's best days are behind it, the avocado salsa and fajitas will always compensate for the iffy service and lack luster environment."}
{"text":"We've been to a closer La Parrilla Suiza before, so when it turned out that we could get diner miles by going to this one, we thought we'd try it, even though it's much further out.  Maybe they had an off night, but I had some serious issues with hygiene! I'm not usually too fussy on this kind of thing, but the tables were dirty, there was old crud and new food stuck all over the table and in the grout lines of the tiled table, the floors had clearly not been cleaned in a while (food from previous diners was still all over the floor) and the toilets were in a terrible state of disrepair!  One toilet was completely blocked, another was covered in excrement and the sink wall had some kind of damage too, like a chunk off the wall missing. There was water/pee and toilet paper all over the floor too!  When my daughter and I returned from the restroom, we told the waiter what state the ladies was in and he somewhat grunted in acknowledgement, but when my daughter needed to go again before leaving, nothing had changed.  The food was ok, but to be honest, I had a hard time enjoying it.  We won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We've been there quite a few times! The food is good, the portions are good, the service is usually good too and the prices are quite reasonable!"}
{"text":"The food was sub par.  Watered down beans, flavorless meat and wilted attempt at side greens for the tacos left much to be desired.  I would never recommend anyone eat at this restaurant.  Unsure if I have ever had this bad of a food experience."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of visiting in Mexico. Upon entering its kind of worn down and relaxed.. the staff smiles at you through the smoky air. The smoke lingering is from the fajitas juices hitting mesquite charcoal as they bring them to your table. Heavenly!  Now Ive been here many times of the years as it's very close to my work. When there are vendors in town we usually take them here as a nice alternative to all the chains that they seem to prefer. So over time Ive tried many dishes here but my favorite is what's called a Pechuga.. breast of chicken with melted cheese served between two flour tortillas. For me this is so good because of the trio of salsa's they bring to you after your sat. They make a green, a red and a pico de gallo so the Pechuga is the perfect platform for all their tasty salsa's. The #15 comes with the Pechuga as well as 2 beef tacos.. the taco's aren't served in those greasy hard shells but in fresh corn tortillas.. Mexico City style! Another great crevice to pour loads of salsa into! Mmm!  Salsa and crevice.. what a great combo!"}
{"text":"We like dinning here for a little different type of Mexican food. It's more of a TexMex style place and so if your looking for your traditional Mexican food, this is not the place. The service is awesome and always welcoming."}
{"text":"This is a few days late, but it's here.  We were here two nights ago and throughly had a great dinners experience. We start out with our waitress bringing us chips and salsa. There were 3 salsas, a red salsa, pico se gallo, and an avocado/tomatillo sauce, al very good and tasty. My husband had a shredded beef burrito with beans and rice. I had the chicken an cheese stuffed tortillas (mini quesadillas) and steak tacos-Oh my the tacos were so good-with rice and charro beans. These charro beans were some of the best restaurant whole pinto beans I've ever had. After dinner our check was brought to us, my husband paid for it and we left. It was getting late so we headed to our hotel. When we got there we did not have our credit card. Panic mode for me-I called the restaurant told them who I was gave the name on the card and it was there. Praise God! My husband was told the waitress tried to chase us down but we were too far ahead of her. I thank you for your honesty and we enjoyed our dinner. Five stars to the restaurant, staff and our great waitress."}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner and left very disappointed. The place seemed very dingy, unkept - when we finally got our food, I didn't even eat mine. It was not the most pleasant burro I've had, to put it kindly. - for the price you could get much better quality food elsewhere. Would not reccomend going here, unfortunately!!"}
{"text":"I have loved this place since I was 10 years old. Now be careful they occationally mess up and make white rice. I dont know why they do this. Its always random, then people complain and their food rice is back..  Anyways the salsa is my favorite of any place i have ever been in my life.  But seriously the tortilla soup.  I have never found another like it. I am dying wanting the recipe. I need it. I can't wait to come back to arizona for it. You must have it. Everything is great, i always ask for refried rather than charro beans.. when they arent on the silly white rice thing their rice is divine"}
{"text":"Yup, I like what I see and what I like seeing is real homemade corn tortillas on a parilla! Parilla Suiza keep it goin' you're doing something right! I haven't been disappointed yet.  I enjoy the tacos with carne asada, the parillada was huge and that arroz & beans... mmm... rico.  So the only thing I noted changed on my last trip was a re-vamp o the menu... Originally I was a bit disappointed that they now have a burger and ribs on their menu... nothing about that is Mexican but HEY we are in AMERICA baby and in America we enjoy a good burger or ribs now and then, so... why not!? Although I haven't given them a whirl... nor will I because my trip to La Parilla is strictly about the Comida Mexicana!  Thumbs up Parilla keep those corn tortillas coming!"}
{"text":"All i have to say is im sorry garcias but you have been replaced . Starting with customer service to the salsas and main courses and even the music is more than 5 stars .  excelent place . definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Well here i go again with a Mexican Restaurant review. Now as you all know with my review of Rito's Mexican restaurant i am not a Mexican food lover...but i must tell you LaParrilla Suiza has great AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The wife and I found this establishment by accident last weekend while we were out shopping. A co-worker had mentioned this place to me a week earlier but i didn't realize this establishment was within walking distance of our apartment. My co-worker lives in the west valley so she goes to the location in Mesa and she told me if i wanted Authentic Mexican food at a great price then visit LaParrilla Suiza.  So imagine my surprise when we found this gem in all places, a strip mall, right across from the Paradise Valley mall here in the east valley. So i walked in and got a take out menu...and the establishment was very nice and well maintained. I ordered the Chile Relleno because my friend Manuela told me all about it and she thought i would like it...and she was right. The wife and I shared it because there were two of them along with refried beans, rice, and coleslaw.   Now the Coleslaw is not really what you would envision as traditional coleslaw...because it is not wet at all...but it is not bad either. Now Manuela also recommended  the Queso Suizo which is a pure cheese dish, the tortilla soup, which i am definitely trying on my next visit, the Pechuga Suiza con Alambre de Res, and the Pechuga Suiza which is chicken breast. I plan on trying all of these in the near future and i will keep you all posted on what i think of each dish. However my friends feel free after reading this review to try the food for yourself because if you like Authentic Mexican food in the valley of the sun then go no further than LaParrilla Suiza. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today for the first time as my husband has been looking for chicken soup as good as we get in Mexico.  This is the place , the soup is delicious tho a bit salty and could use more veggies and rice but he really liked it. Those are minor things except salt.   They have a great lunch special lots of choices so we asked the waitress. She suggested the sirloin tacos called Alhambre tacos. They come with the best refried beans and rice. Delicious.  Spiced perfect.     The three salsas that come with chips before the meals are so good I couldn't quit eating them.     We will be back for sure. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in this town."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about La Parrilla Suiza that when we got a coupon in the mail we decided we had to try it. The chips and salsa are great. I really like that you get three different types of salsa; a red spicy one, a green one that has an avocado flavor and a chucky pico de gallo. I had the shrimp melt. It was a like a tostada with shrimp and lots of avocado, cilantro, and cheese. It was delicious and very fresh tasting. It came with a side of pinto beans and rice. I like that the food is true to Mexico City and not the usual saucey and heavy Mexican food you see at restaurants. While the food was great the service was a little spotty.  We saw our waiter bring our food and that was about it . Hopefully, this was just a one off situation with the service. I would try La Parrilla Suiza again just based off how great the chips and salsa were. However, if I had the same waiter experience as this I wouldn't return to this location."}
{"text":"Had a family get-together here, and while the food tasted good, the pain I suffered throughout the night afterwards was not worth it. I had stomach and gut pain like knives in my guts. All night.  The service was also very slow. Plates should have been cleared, drinks brought, very slow. I personally won't be back."}
{"text":"Ive been there twice.  The first time, I went with my mom for a margarita lunch.  We ordered the fried cheese and mushroom appetizer and some shrimp tacos along with some margaritas.  Our server knew the menu well and guided us well on our ordering.  We absolutely loved the fried cheese mushroom appetizer which came out sizzling on a skillet.  The shrimp was well cooked and the margaritas were fairly stong and very tasty.  THAT WAS MY FIRST VISIT.  The second time I came in with my daughter and my friend.  The salsa was not the same as before...it litterally just tasted like some tomatoes blended in a food processer.  We asked for new salsa....same.  The manager came up to us as he noticed we ordered different salsa.  We asked him to try it.  He did and then kinda giggled and said too many people complain how spicy the salsa is so they toned it down....Well, a little too much in my opinion.  (at least have a hot and mild option)  The food came out and it was....ehhh.  I had the chicken tortilla soup and the fried cheese/mushroom appetizer.  It just wasn't as exciting as before...no sizzle...not even really hot.  My friend ordered a tamale and chile relleno....she barely ate any of it.  My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas...dry and bland.  I was disappointed the second time around but still give 3 stars for the first visit that was good. (even though I may have only liked it because I was tipsy)"}
{"text":"I've been to this La Parrila Suiza a couple of times now. I keep getting invited by some friends to join them in this Mexico City food fest.  They love this place so I've hesitant in writing this review but after our last meal I feel I must \"spill the beans\"...  Service ~ They are really friendly and helpful when ordering but they are very slow. I mean, come on!  You can only play \"eye spy\" so many times before you loose interest in why your there to begin with.  The only... and I mean only reason we did not leave was due to their tri-salsa dippage action with crispy chips.  It is really one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creamy kinda of dip  Food ~ Chicken flautas were ok, three of them fried, topped with sour cream and Piquillo sauce served with rice, guacamole cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw and beans were not goo at all.    We also had the Chicken Melt which was very good but we were shorted one of the tortillas!  It was supposed to be two flour tortillas filled with melted cheese, chicken bacon, avocado and tomatoes, topped with cheese and a sauce. It also came with their beans rice and cole slaw.  It took so long to get our order we didn't bother saying anything...  Our last order was a chicken taco salad.  It was HUGE and served in a very crisp tortillas bowl.  The salad was tossed with all of the ingredients which was different.  I enjoy separating some of the chicken, cheese and other goodies in the salad bowl, but with this salad you could not do that ~ it was all tossed together.  The chicken was very cold and tasted blah. The bland dressing was also tossed into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushy lettuce, yuk-a-roo.  So if your meeting a friend and they are buying this might be a good place for you to go."}
{"text":"So i decided I wanted to try something new for lunch and was over near La Parilla Suiza figured would give it a shot, bad idea. First of the server completely misleads me intentionally from ordering a $6 apetizer to a $16 meal by asking me if I want mushrooms with all nonchalantly like it was optional ti have with an appetizer, little did I know that now allowed him to charge me for a dinner on their menu how lovely. Then the appetizer was not even what he told me it was or description said it was which was supposed be queso dip instead was just like a huge gob of melted cheese with mushrooms of course obviously unappetizing. Whrn i got the bill and asked him why the $16.99 dinner he told that ai said that was what I wanted I explained that he nonchalantly told me that it came with if I wanted to which he nor the manager cared at all about. So I only gave him a 10% which is very low by my standards. As i am leaving I see him picked it up and call me an ahole. Two points to the story #1 La Parilla Suiza blows don't go there and #2 stick with what you know shoulda went to Valle Luna"}
{"text":"Okay, this is my absolute favorite Mexican Food restaurant in the valley! I realize that we have a lot to choose from here but La Parilla Suiza is still at the top of my list! They have a great selection of Margaritas, amazing Chicken Tortilla Soup, and of course a great selection of grilled entr√©es. The flan and sopillas are also worth a taste! The servings are very generous, especially with the grilled plates. On Friday & Saturday nights they have a great mariachi band playing. The service is fast, the food is authentic and the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how tasty the food was! The decor is typical. The staff was friendly. The chips come with two different salsas to start the meal. I had the number 31 which is like a quesadilla with a thin pork cutlet hidden within. The tortilla was crisped just right- the cheese was the good white melty mexican stuff that's not too greasy, and the pork was the right thickness and not overcooked. It was so simple but so good. I'd eat it again and again and I just may."}
{"text":"If you're looking for greasy, dirty, late-night drunk Mexican food, don't come here.  They only got the high quality shit here.  Lean and clean."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, I'll definitely be back. I ordered a number 52: shredded beef chimichanga enchilada style with beans and rice.  The chimichanga was huge, lightly fried, and covered with enchilada sauce and cheese. It was not greasy how some chimis can be. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the shredded beef was. It was perfectly cooked, lightly seasoned and very tender. Very generous portion of meat that you can cut with a fork.  The pinto beans were good and had a pork flavor. The rice had a great taste and was very fresh.  We received a complimentary order of chips and roja, verde and pico sauces.  Great place!"}
{"text":"My husband came here a couple of years ago and said it was great but I guess things have changed. We came here on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm and it was dead, maybe two other tables seated. We ordered an appetizer and drinks, and they brought a basket of chips. Salsas were good and chips were hot, we finished our first baskets of chips and waited a while before we were given another basket of chips and salsas, then waited some more and then they came out with our appetizer. Just a thin metal tray with some melted cheese on it and a couple tortillas. We finished that too and then they even asked if we wanted another basket of chips, we declined since we were already getting full mindlessly munching waiting so long for our food. I think it took them over an hour to get our food to us, there were several times where we heard plates crashing to the ground so I think everyone in the place was waiting for food to be made several times over. Once we finally did get our food it was pretty good, nice sized portions but since we had so many chips and drinks waiting we all needed to take half to-go. Our server was friendly so I'm hoping they were just short staffed and training because it was a disappointment this time around."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious Charro Beans I've ever had! They carne (can't remember what they call it) is so amazingly delicious. And you get a trio of salsas when you come in"}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot in the area for Mexican food.  I love their chips and trio of salsas..especially the verde and pico.  We generally get the cheese enchilada combo.  Very good rice and beans to compliment.  I've also had their shrimp dish and chile relleno.  The tortilla soup is also one of my favorites.  I feel like someone's little Abuela is making all the food in the back.  Enrique is the BEST server in the history of servers (did I mention I used to wait tables? Yep..he is even better then me in my hey day)."}
{"text":"Had the shredded beef chimichanga with jalape√±o cream cheese. It was really good. BIG portions! My husband and I shared it and still couldn't finish it. Fried ice cream was really good as well. My only suggestion is they need to let the ice cream sit out a little bit before serving it. It was so frozen we couldn't dig in without getting a knife involved. Lol. Staff was super friendly and great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The services was HORRIBLE! That's why this is a 3-star review and not a 4-star. The manager sat at the bar and did nothing else. The waitress came to our table twice (once to bring us chips/take our order and another to bring the food). We had to go up to the bar and ask the manager to get our check. No refills, no \"how is your food\", no sides that we asked for 3 times. NOTHING. We won't be returning. I'll check out another location instead."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years.  However, not in the last year.  Went there last night and the service was dreadful.  The place was very hot and dirty.  The food was similar to what you would get at Taco Bell.  The burro I had was full of dried out chicken and nothing else. The beans taste like they were from a can.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed. We have eaten at all three Tucson locations and have never had a bad experience. This location left much to be desired. Our waitress was terrible. She started walking away before I had even finished ordering, repeating us back the partial order and it was wrong. We had to call her back to finish our order.  The food was....ok. It did not have the freshness we have grown accustomed to like the Tucson locations. My refried beans looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for days. They were dry and crusty. The waitress brought my meal out before my husband's was even ready. It was so odd. By the time my husband's came out and we could eat, my meal was nice and cold. We definitely won't be back. It would be worth the two hour drive to eat at any of the Tucson locations."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers who gave La Parilla average or lower ratings.   The food just isn't that great. Why? If they we're really serving Mexico City food it would have some flavor. Everything my partner and I had was just s-o-o -o plain. Rarely does he complain about a meal, but he just didn't like it.  Ultimately we all like different things and that's why some people rate this place higher than others. It's a great thing we all don't like the same things, otherwise this world would be very boring."}
{"text":"Its mothers day, so this was my pic. From positive yelp reviews, the abundance of Hispanic patronage witnessed upon arrival in the parking lot, and my craving for a margarita pronto, I made my selection. Thoroughly satisfied with my choice for my moms day feast! Not sure why some have given less than 4 star reviews, but based on my experience, my only conclusion is they do not like really great Mexican food. Im a really picky eater, especially when it comes to meat and I ate every morsel of beef off my plate.. truly a welcomed rarity!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend wanted to try something new. We drove past this place and decided to stop by for lunch. Walking in its a very nice authentic Mexican style place. The server was great on checking up if we needed anything. Filling our drink replacing the chip basket. Although when our food was served it wasn't so authentic. Rice was flavorless. Tacos & quesadillas were super plain. Seemed like a was eating a taco full of onions & bell peppers. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Manager is a big Liar ! This place has Decent food but, they Rip you off when they have the opportunity ! I have been to this place regularly since its next to my work for the last year and half and I particularly like their flan dessert but, last night when i took a take out as usual for the flan and paid the regialr 7$ for it the size was cut to one third (1/3) and they still charged me 7$. I realized this when I opened up the flan back home and went to them today to let them know that they have made a mistake but, the manager on duty (older guy with mustache) aside from being very rude and impolite told me that they never had the bigger size and they always sell the smaller size. This is lying into customers face and very unprofessional. its not a matter of couple of bucks but, the integrity. if they are willing to lie about such a small place I am not even sure how good of a quality is their food ingeredients or the hygiene of their kitchen. i am very disappointed and will not go back here and not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Very disappointed here. Food looked great until I cut into and noticed that slight pink hue that comes with canned shredded chicken. Everything was very bland with little to no flavor. Still, I choked down my meal because I was hungry only to find my \"mild\" sauce was anything but. Felt sick even before paying my tab. Very high prices for fake food. The only thing I can say for certain was homemade was the guacamole simply given that even canned guacamole is that bland and awful."}
{"text":"Summary: not impressed.  Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.  Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.  My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.  I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite.   Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best.   $50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.  The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the three salsas, generous tasty fajitas and Mexico City style food made here. Been eating at La P's for 25 years!  My family drove from Goodyear to eat, now we come from Phoenix. Did I mention how good the food is?"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. Iv been looking for a Mexican restaurant that has really good actual Mexican food. This place had excellent salsa. Salsa that didn't taste like ketchup and chili powder. This salsa had really good Mexican hot kick to it. The Waitress we had was very polite and attentive to my needs. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and it was ok, but just not as good as I expected it to be. I ordered the enchiladas suiza and I could say that it's Good, but not great..their margaritas are pretty great I had a couple of those!   The food isn't over priced or anything and neither are the drinks. They have really good service too, the staff was well mannered and very pleasant to me and my boyfriend   There wasn't reall a lot of people around that day so it wasn't loud inside at all..the bathrooms aren't dirty and they keep the seating area well maintained.   I do recommend trying this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 20 years and it is, by far, my favorite Mexican food place. The chips and salsa are amazing, and the fajitas are spot on! I love the enchiladas and tortilla soup as well."}
{"text":"So, my husband and I travel all over and have also lived in Mexico.  I had tried this place once when it first came to Mesa,and was not impressed, but decided to give it another chance tonight.  Yes, I have read all the reviews, both good and bad, and never go by what others think of restaurants.  Truthfully, most people do not know what good food is.  La Parilla is very clean and the staff is truly friendly and attentive (there were no problems with the wait staff not speaking English as others have thoughtlessly posted.  It wouldn't have been a problem anyway as my husband speaks Spanish quite well).  Our drinks arrived within minutes as well as the chips and salsa trio...That is where things went downhill.  The red salsa tasted exactly like Heize tomato sauce out of the can with onion added, the pico de gallo was ok, but without the red onion and lime that could make it truly stellar, and the avacado crema (it could not be called a guacamole) was watery and had the overripe banana flavor that we associate with avacados going bad.  We ordered the cheese crisp, which is one of our main judging points of all Mexican restaurants.  It also arrived quickly and had plenty of melted monterey jack cheese, but the tortilla underneath was cooked nearly to death, almost to the point of being burned.  It did not have the crisp, almost cinnamon flavor of fresh baked, homemade tortillas, but the flour and paste flavor that shows the ratio is off and that they were made with poor quality AP flour.      We both know Mexico City food, as well as Sonoran, and this was not good quality Mexican food all the way around.  Needless to say, we declined to order an entree and instead left without finishing the appetizer.  Disappointing, and we will not return, although we wished we would have been wrong...There are so few really good places to eat in Mesa."}
{"text":"My wife grew up on the Brownsville/Matamoros border and I lived there for 6 years prior to our move here 2 years ago...This is the first place in the Phoenix area that has reminded us of home...(even the single refill on your drink...classic South Texas mom and pop restaurant drink move, I laughed when I read that on the menu).  And yes, tacos are supposed to feature corn tortillas fried in oil and then stuffed with deliciousness...it tastes better that way....Rice....this is the way it is supposed to taste...Pollo Loco on 41st and Thomas (Yes, I'm calling you out!) stop by for a rice making lesson...The beans, refried or a la charra were both well seasoned and flavorful.  The Alambre was excellent (probably because I love bacon). The mole was excellent...I've had mole sweetened with peanut butter or sugar...this one tasted like tamarind, I like it alot and my wife, who loves enmoladas (mole chicken enchiladas), said this was the best she has ever had...that is high praise, because her sister makes a dang good mole.  I can't help but give this place 5 stars, I'll go back...many many many times.  Thank you Texas Roadhouse for being too crowded on a Friday night, otherwise we may have never tried this place."}
{"text":"I shouldn't really be giving these guys a review.  We were there at  8:00pm on a Sunday night.  The place was running slow and it's a large restaurant. We had two Margaritas and the Parrillada Mixta.  Which is a presentation of a \"mixta\" of meats served on a 2\" 1/2 Hotel pan inside a warming \"grill\".  Chorizo on one side of the pan, Steak on the other  and a bell pepper in the middle full of cheese.  A couple fresh small flour tortillas full of the same cheese.  I'm not overly tolerant of cheese so it was the wrong choice for me:  The wife loved it!  The salsa verde was to die for!  The food was fresh and the tortillas are made in house.  The service was good too.  We had a good time.  The place is too large to be quaint.  It probably awesome when it's jam packed though!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with how good the food tasted.  Normally Mexican rice is dry and I usually don't eat it but this was the best I have tasted in a Mexican restaurant. Food presentation was like eating at a high end restaurant.  Not your typical Mexican restaurant. Very very nice all the way around.  Will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for dinner and did not have a very good experience.  First, the dinner took a very very long time to arrive.  It was only 4:45 so not very many people were seated and we could not figure out why it took so long.  My chicken dish was not very warm on the inside.  It did not have any flavor, it was like someone mixed up some chicken, salted it, wrapped it in thick tortillas and poured a little sauce on it.  I didn't even finish it.  Boyfriend likes his #42 which is why I agreed to go there again.  It's a hot metal plate with some meat and cheese he likes.  My 1 drink was $8.50 and much too sweet, maybe sprite was added or something but I did not drink even half of it and it made my stomach hurt.  No wines listed, and no draught beer, only bottles.  The bill before tip was well over $40.00 and our original waiter didn't even stay to collect his tip, he walked out off the clock as we were leaving and someone else gave us the bill.   Had I known he was not going to finish our service I would have left less. The wait staff is always courteous there, but the food just took much too long.  They haven't changed the menu in so many years.  I think they should make some changes, work in something new, and expand the salads, fajitas, and taco options with new/unique ingredients.  Chips and 3 salsas are always delicious.  The d√©cor and location is so good, the place has potential but I won't be back for a long time if ever.   Prices are too high, menu is old, they need some specials."}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving some Mexican food since it's getting cooler outside.   I will admit I went in here totally skeptical and ready to be disappointed ...........but you know what......I wasn't!!!   It was very clean, friendly and attentive staff, a window opened to the kitchen area to see the cooks in action.   I was served chips with a salsa trio, there was chunky pico de gallo, smooth red and the tomatillo green. (see pics)   All tasted OK, none were very spicy at all but that was fine with me.  My favorite was the green, although I added some salt and lemon juice to it to make more flavorful it still was a great fresh sauce, I could have eaten it with a spoon!  I ordered from the lunch menu, where all items were $6.99.  I chose the chicken melt it was a grilled tortilla topped with melted cheese ,grilled chicken, tomato and avocado, served with rice and beans (see pics)   Wow! A perfect light lunch that I didn't feel guilty eating, it was so good!   I have to give 4 stars based on my experience today, I will go back and hopefully thing will be as good next time too."}
{"text":"Gross...got the carna asada steak, so bland...it was just a bad quality piece of meat and not marinated nor seasoned.  Also had a quie a bid of fat on it which carne usually doesn't."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! Flavor meat and tasty side greens. Good experience and friendly staff. Pricey yet the servings is satisfying already."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and wow the chicken was amazing! I was caught off guard with the color but the manager was walking by and he explained it's how cooked. The meal is large in portion. Highly recommend. I did get up to go out side because it was extremely cold and the manager quickly came over and said I didn't like it he would get me something. That's great customer service and very happy to see they take action in pleasing their customers. Will be back:)"}
{"text":"Cute place.....but the booth situation needs to be addressed. The backs are loose so the guy behind you pushes you forward. Creamy green salsa and warm chips are very good! 42.00 later.......the food was ok.... Standard at best.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This food is just....fantastic.  I don't know what else to say.  I grew up eating at La Parrilla Suiza in Tucson.  The tortilla soup and \"Queso Suiza\" (read mouth-watering melted white cheese that you slather all over tortillas) is TO DIE FOR.   I don't even like soup.  And the tortilla soup you get at most places is just plain nasty.  Not true here.  We drive about 16 miles just to eat at this place.  And, I'll tell you what - it's worth it.  The free chips and salsa alone are fantastic.  Couple that with the soup and some tacos or enchiladas or a chimichanga and you're in heaven.  And the margaritas are pretty damn good too.  We have taken friends and family to this restaurant, and have never once heard a complaint.  It's simply the best Mexican food I have tasted in all of Phoenix.  Yes - I see posts about the waiters and waitresses not speaking good English.  It's true....so what.  You don't go here to have a friendly conversation.  You go for the food.  So get over it....   And eat.  :-)"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the service was horrible.   I got the Alambre tacos sans bell peppers and it was one of the best things I've tasted. The tortillas were perfectly thick and soft, the meat wasn't over-cooked, and the bacon and onions were a perfect compliment. The complimentary chips and salsa (comes with three types) were great, too - especially the verde sauce. My mother is on a restrictive diet so she asked the waitress if it was possible to get a side of vegetables instead of beans and rice. We expected a nice selection of squash, corn, peppers etc. (as are listed available for their vegetarian options). However, she received a bowl of what looked like canned mixed vegetables. Nonetheless, everything else on the plate was fine. Prices were a little higher than your average Mexican restaurant, but what I got was quality, so it's worth the few extra dollars.  It took way too long to get our order taken and our check given, and then the waitress gave us the wrong change (short $10!) and it took awhile to get her attention to fix it. While it was dinner time (6-7pm) on a week night, it was not busy at all.  I would go back just because my tacos were so great tasting but I will have to try a different location to see if the service is more timely."}
{"text":"The service here at La Parrilla Suiza is outstanding. The wait staff is always friendly, the restaurant is clean, the environment is welcoming and most importantly the food has never failed to be delicious!"}
{"text":"What has happened to this place? It used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the last 2 times including last night the service and food have gone to shit. First, the queso w/chorizo appetizer wasn't even hot enough to be able to pull it apart. The \"hot charcoal\" was just ash when we received the dish. Cold enough that I could pick it up bare handed.  My son ordered ground beef soft tacos with just cheese. On the first attempt they had everything on them and were in hard shells. 2nd attempt they brought back friggin chicken. 3rd attempt was soft tacos with everything. I ordered carne asada w/enchilada and received the coldest, worst cut of meat I have ever eaten.  No apologies or anything.....so obviously they no longer care which would explain why it was so dead at 7pm. My family warned me about my last bad experience but I tried to chalk it up to just a bad night. Now we know this is the new way they service the customer. Ba Bye!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for some pretty quality Mexican food here in the valley. Service was incredibly freindly and we were seated right away upon entering the restaurant. You get started off with chips and 2 different kinds of salsa, one red and one green. Both were very good and flavorful. I went with the Parillada Mixta, as I was told this is what this place is famous for. This thing was insane. It comes out on a tabletop grill, complete with hot coals in the bottom and everything. Charbroiled beef strips, chorizo, grilled onions, two little cheese quesadillas and a bell pepper stuffed with cheese. You can get your choice of tortillas for the side as well. Amazing. The type of thing you order with a group of people and everyone just goes to town, building their own little delicious tacos. I'm a huge fan of that sort of \"family style\" of eating. I can't even remember what the wife had, but it came with their Charro beans which were insanely flavorful. Just the broth alone in the beans was outstanding. This place was very very good, I went there on a sunday, around lunch time, and again, was seated promptly and our server was very attentive. Try this place, bring a small group and order a couple different Pariladas, and some cold beers and enjoy some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place since I was very young. The food has always been delish and more authentic then the average Mexican place.  You must get the queso suiza for appetizer.  Melted cheese with tortillas what is not to love.  Chips and salsa are also yummy.  Three different types to choose from. We usually get the alambra skillets when we are with a crowd.  Yummy saut√©ed protein with bacon.  What is not to love about that?? This is always on our list for out of town guests.  Never had a bad meal and always leave full!!"}
{"text":"Have never been before but had heard good things about it, so tried it out.  It was enjoyable....not as good as some of the Mexican restaurants I recently experienced in California, but I'd say better than the Mexican chain restaurants you see on every corner.  The food was good, service was fast and it seemed like a popular spot."}
{"text":"Service Here Is horrible!!! Waiters Here Are SloW and Impolite lack of Customer skills Beans Abd Tortillas Were Cold  Salsa had funny taste to it Chips were Not Fresh"}
{"text":"I don't know what kind of crack some of you are smoking to say this is \"just like Mexico City food.\" It isn't.  Mi esposa, si, es del D.F., y hemos comido en muchos lugares alla, INCLUYENDO La Parrilla Suiza.  Which means, my wife is from Mexico, Distrito Federal, and we have eaten in many places there, INCLUDING the original Parrilla Suiza locations en el D.F.  This place is NOTHING like those del D.F.  This is an attempt to \"hoodwink\" gringos who don't know any better.  Whilst the fare is quite a step up from Serranos or Garcias, it really isn't all that much better, the prices are a bit ridiculous, and the service leaves a lot to be desired.  As far as I can tell, the only similarity between the US and D.F. locations are the logos on the outside walls.  Not a big fan of false advertising.  If you want real comida del D.F., go to Los Reyes de la Torta."}
{"text":"Here's what I love about La Parilla Suiza: its simply good. The strip mall location across from the un-hip PV mall doesn't bely the fantastic experience inside.   I've eaten there many times throughout the years and it never disappoints. Since leaving PHX, its been a couple of years since I stopped through, but this experience felt like a homecoming. Why do I bother with other \"trendy\" locations when my old friend stays consistently great?  The tortilla soup is EXACTLY what it is supposed to be. If you get it, don't skimp on the sour cream and avocado because the extra calories are well worth it. The broth itself is flavorful if simple, the tortilla strips are toasted THEN added to the soup and its just too good for words.  I also had the fish tacos on this trip - I usually don't eat fish tacos, there is nothing worse than a place that messes up such a simple dish, but La Parilla didn't disappoint. The tortillas are soft and pliable, the fish was remarkably good and the batter wasn't too over powering. They don't heap 12lbs of junk on it, they just let it shine. They keep the fresh chips coming and the \"green\" salsa is so good, I usually ask for additional to take home.  I have had the Parilla Suiza that other Yelpers love and I concur with their assessments too.   And on our last trip, during a fairly busy lunch, we are greeted with warmth immediately both at the door and by Hector our waiter. He practically TRIPPED over himself to give us great service. Never rushing, just making sure everything was great. He made recommendations and honestly, made me feel like I was in the large home of a great cook.   I just think the food here is underrated, its simple, fresh and well done. The service is always warm and prompt..and I now that my green salsa is gone, I guess I will have to wait until I am in PHX again for anything even remotely so good.   If you haven't been, you should. Prices are reasonable, the staff is great and the cooks are confident enough to let the food stand on its own without layers of junk.  Why can't more restaurants, Mexican or not take a note from that book?   Adios PHX and La Parilla Suiza, I'll see you next time!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Mole in the WORLD!!!  Needs to be on your Bucket List."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I moved to Arizona from California last year and have been searching everywhere for some good mexican food without any success. Yesterday, two of my coworkers were talking about this restaurant and its tortilla soup and cheese appetizer and tonight we decided to try it out.  Pros- good chips and salsa. my corona was ok too. fast service but I hate when servers do no clear the appetizers, dirty plates before the main course. And then give the check without clearing the table.  Bad- the FOOD !! tortilla soup was okay, really nothing special, I would not order it again. I guess when I think of tortilla soup, I expect cilantro, onion, chips, chicken but it was just broth and chips and cheese.   We ordered the cheese and mushroom appetizer since my coworkers recommended it. We had a few bites of thick cheese and we were not impressed. tasted like canned mushrooms and bad cheese. We ate about 1/3 before just letting it sit there.  Main courses arrived and while they looked pretty, my swiss enchiladas with red sauce were GROSS. I took one bite and made a face. The sauce tasted very ketchup like and the chicken had no flavor. Beans were floating in broth and tasteless... like watered down bbq beans. I got about 3 bites into my 3 enchiladas and just gave up. My bf's shrimp tacos were better and had a few bites of his.   Overall, 40 dollars for us to eat and the only thing that were good were the chips. I'm not sure why my coworkers liked it but maybe its because I am used to good Californian Mexican food? Sigh, still looking for decent mexican food here in the valley."}
{"text":"Only been here for lunch.  Impressed with the $6.99 specials.  Chicken Chimi is pretty tasty, also had some sort of chicken tacos.  They were a little dry, but the array of available salsa's that are offered with the chips spiced them up just right."}
{"text":"Something that I like the most about this place is the multiple options of salsa when you get your chips.  The food is ok and the service isn't that great but every time I've been in there it's been alright.  It is very convenient to my place of work so that is why I've been a return customer"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant in early 2017 and went often because their lunch specials and Happy Hour overlapped by one hour.  So now they change their \"Happy Hour\" to one hour later.  We did go in because they do have \"Senior\" discount.  Well, their \"Happy Hour Margaritas\" have increased in price, and you either get \"Senior\" discount or \"Happy Hour \", but not both.  Well, they have lost our business."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, much better than all the chains around! They have great salsas and tons of options on the menu! Service is always good and fast as well."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place. We went to sit down and there was a cockroach on the seat. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We ate here once before and it wasn't to bad. Maybe average. So we tried it again but this time it was awful.  I had the 12 dollar fish tacos. Or should I say fish stick tacos. The fish was literally shaped like a fish stick and of the same quality, and we aren't talking Mrs Paul quality. We are talking school lunch quality.  The little bit of fish that was in them was dried out, orange and sour. When I first saw it I thought it was marinaded in something until I unwrapped it to take out all the purple cabbage and realized it was a fried fish stick and nothing fresh about it.  A pile of purple cabbage with a fish stick wrapped up in a giant flour tortillas is not a fish taco. The little bit of it I did eat made me sick all night and into today. On the bright side our waiter was very good."}
{"text":"Went to La Parrilla Suiza today for lunch with the wife and it was excellent!  I heard you people from work talk about this place, so thought we would try it out.  The whole beans, and rice were delicious.  I had the beef enchiladas with red sauce and the wife had the chicken mole.  Both dishes were super delicious .  Service was fast and friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexico City cuisine, a departure from the northern Mexican food more Phoenicians are accustomed to. The restaurant is open, the service is top notch and the food is really what draws the crowds. One key difference in Mexico City food is most of the meat is grilled over charcoal. This gives all dishes a unique and flavorful taste that is much different than your average \"stew it all together\" flavors.  The menu is vast with many options for all palettes. If chicken is your thing, I'd recommend the Chilaquiles Suizos. I've yet to try the Mesa location; being an EV guy myself I need to get out there with the family. I've been to the Tatum location with co-workers and the experience was excellent.  You owe it to yourself to try La Parrilla Suiza (translated as 'The Swiss Grill') to enjoy a wonderful menu, and top tiered service."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Tucson I now live in Mesa had trouble finding any kind of a Mexican food restaurant that I like up here. Came here and this is the only place we always go for Mexican food now love them... I make sure I try everything different each time I go but I always do get a margarita on the rocks. ;-) good place to go..."}
{"text":"OH   MY   GAWD   ! ! ! Fantastic Mexican food!! I was raised on Mexican food and this is some of the best if not the best I have ever had and the portions were huge! The beans are usually something I can pass on but the charro beans taste like they were cooked all day with a ham hock, soooo delicious!! All the food was crazy flavorful and cooked to perfection!  Also our server, Enrique, was very friendly, prompt and knowledgable went the extra mile.  Everything about our experience here was perfect! We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Jury duty makes you hungry.    I rushed over here one fateful fall day from the courthouse a few miles away and had a pleasant enough meal.  The staff was lovely and the patio was a nice place to get some reading done.  All in all, though, the food was pretty unremarkable.  It's Mexico City-style food, so it's not quite your typical Tex-Mex fare.  Not a problem, but there are so many other places to spend your dough.  Meh."}
{"text":"La Parilla Suiza is a nice authentic breath of fresh air in Phoenix. Everything from the food, to the atmosphere, and people who work there give it a Mexico city vibe. A great place to take out of towners who want a taste of the west, or someone who loves Mexican food. The only downside? Service hasn't been great when I was there."}
{"text":"Super Great just like the one in Tucson. Delicious original menu with lots of great cheese! YUM"}
{"text":"I thought it high time that I do a review for this restaurant. The staff is very attentive, the manager comes by to make sure all is well. The atmosphere and music is very lovely. And the food...  I have brought extended family here several times and the food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  It is one of me and my daughter's favorite places to come and feast.  The only complaint I have is that the water and tea taste bad. Tap water is no good. So we always buy a soda or margarita! I do recommend this place... and definitely try the Chicken Enchilada Suiza with Green sauce!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's 30th birthday and I actually really enjoyed the experience.  We had a private area to eat, the food (while Americanized) was very good. Plus, the beer choices for a Mexican restaurant were decent (they have Bohemia).  I am on a CRAZY diet and have to have my food come out in weird ways (annoying I know but it's temporary) and the waitress was VERY accommodating with it.  She got everything right and was super attentive, which we very much appreciated.  I wouldn't mind returning at all."}
{"text":"Looking over the other reviews, I'm the odd man out for once. When we sat down the table and the menus were sticky, like a margarita had spilled and only been half cleaned up. I guess I can over look that, but things didn't get much better.  The people working were so so so so nice! But the food was disappointing. Inside felt like a classier TGIFridays with a sombrero.  I'm a huge fan of Mexican food, having grown up in the southwest I consider myself to be kind of a Mexican food snob. I've even been to Mexico City, but I don't remember food like this.  I enjoyed the salsa. The special was pretty nice, 2 drinks (non-alcholic), 2 salads, and 2 entrees for $20. But I don't think I'll hurry back."}
{"text":"The Tucson restaurant with the same name is great, so when we moved up here to Mesa we were expecting the same quality food. It was extremely disappointing. We went for lunch, and I had cheese enchiladas. The red sauce was so bad, that it literally tasted like Spaghetti O sauce. Just pure, unseasoned tomato paste.  I gently asked the server if this was how they always made the red sauce, or if something was done differently that day. She said it's always like that.  I couldn't eat it. We paid our bill in full and will never go back again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would!! This is me and my husbands very favorite place to go.  We LOVE the salsas.  We LOVE the fajitas. Also the chimichangas are good.  Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"This joint was recommended by a friend... So we decided to try it. On a Friday night (maybe around 8:00pm) this place was fairly empty. We were greeted at the door promptly and seated immediately. The server was very attentive and polite. I ordered the \"Enchiladas Suizas\" with green sauce and they where just ok, It came with a small portion of rice beans and a wanna be salad.   Would I try this place again....? Maybe, will I crave it? I highly doubt it  I've had better tasting Mexican food"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Tortilla soup that is legend and the paradillas are amazing. Not much ambience from a strip mall so don't come for the romance, just incredible food."}
{"text":"Oh man, from the only good service which was from the very nice bus-man and the non-existent service from the bartender to the so-called Flautas which were actually nothing more than a major disappointment of small, dingy, tasteless taquitos from a freezer section to the overpriced drinks and overpriced taco a-la-carte, we were nothing short of overly disappointed. I hate to be this way, but it was nothing good, nothing we would ever go back for in a million years or talk about again. It was a frustrating meal, yeah, drinks were strong, doesn't make up for the lack of service, poor quality food and overpriced at that...no thank you."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all.  I expect Mexican food, whose flavor foundation includes garlic, chiles, onion, and lime to be vibrant, but my cheese enchiladas were completely bland.  My peach margarita tasted like sugar water.  This restaurant proclaims itself to be \"Mexico City Food\", but the menu seemed to be comprised of boring Mexican chain restaurant standards.  I was left wondering what was supposed to differentiate this cuisine from other Mexican restaurants (I presume La Parilla Suiza was simply trying to state that it's not a TexMex restaurant). Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and this was bar far the worst. I probably won't  be back unfortunately. The service and food prep has gone down hill. The waitress was rude and cold. The prices are not cheap so I expect it to be on point. My chimi was hardly fried. The food was hardly hot and came out literally 5 minutes after we ordered. I could have waited another 5 minutes so it was served hot. He had the mole chicken enchis  which were tasty but Luke warm. The only redeeming quality was the $7.50  strawberry daiquiri. Good bye!"}
{"text":"I guess I get the 1 star for myself, for never coming back to give an update.  It has been several years since my first visit, but I have been back several times, and every time is a great experience.  Service is excellent, and you cant beat that trio salsa. Haven't been disappointed once. This is our go to mexican restaurant when we can't decide."}
{"text":"My work was offering discounts for this restaurant and since I had been here roughly 5 years ago, and loved it, I thought it would be fun to take my boyfriend here for dinner. So I purchased one of the gift certificates being offered and we visited the Mesa location last night. Unfortunately, it seems the food and quality has really plummeted since my last visit.   Service was subpar. While our server did get us everything we needed in a timely manner she wasn't friendly at all. She seemed bored and almost put off by having to even be there.   The food was...eh. I'm pretty sure our second bowl of chips were left over's from another table. When we first arrived we were given a bowl of very warm chips. As we ran out I watched a manager clear off a table from customers who has just left but they had a full bowl of chips on the table. I watched the manager walk back to the kitchen and within a minute or so our server walked out with a bowl of chips. When I grabbed one it was cold. This tells me the chips on our table didn't come from the same place as the first bowl of warm chips. We didn't touch anymore chips. I'm 100% sure that the shrimp I was given was frozen, and then possibly microwaved. It definitely wasn't freshly cooked shrimp as it was bland, and rubbery. The refried beans are unquestionably canned instead of made fresh. They had that same dry texture and metal taste as the canned variety. My boyfriends carne asada burrito was just that; cooked beef wrapped in a tortilla. No salsa, no sour cream or beans, no onions, no peppers or tomatoes. Nothing was in this tortilla except for cooked beef. I've never seen a burrito that didn't have any other elements to it other than meat. It was strange. We tried the fried ice cream for dessert and they didn't even bother to crush the corn flakes, they just stuck them onto the ice cream whole before slightly frying. Since the cornflakes didn't fry all the way this gave it a terrible, thick, and yet almost stale type of texture. It looked very appealing but it truly was a disappointment compared to other fried ice creams I've had.   Had it not been for the $25 off we would have definitely complained to the manager. We won't be going back nor will we purchase anymore coupons from my work for this restaurant. Quality and service is just too low compared to the prices they have listed. There are better Mexican restaurants around to choose from."}
{"text":"Been going here since birth. Best chicken fajitas in Arizona . Best salsas in Arizona. You guys gotta try this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"La Parilla Suiza was decent. We sat at the bar and split the trio fajitas. They were good, but fajitas are pretty standard so I can't say they were amazing..   I do like how they bring the 3 salsas for the chips and they were accommodating when I asked them to mute the TV.   The one drawback was the service, they were incredibly slow. Painfully slow at the end. Luckily I had great company and didn't mind the wait. If I was in the area I'd go again, but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"When I crave Mexican food but don't want something smothered in cheese and grease, I come to La Parilla Suiza.  I have been here several times, and everything I have had has been great. Most recently, I had a cup of the chicken and rice soup, and a fajita taco a la carte. My husband has the bistec (sp?) tacos. He really liked them.  This place is not too filling and yet you feel very satisfied. Its pretty cool too because you get to watch the guys making everything through one of those glass windows."}
{"text":"I've been here a numerous amount of times and I've never had a complain. They have a vegetarian section on the menu which is one of the reasons I come here often. Even though it's only four items you can still leave the meat out of other dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The service was good but the food was lacking. I had the stuffed pepper dish as it was one of the only non meat dishes on yhe menu.  The dish was mushy in consistency and did not have any wow factor .... very mediocre at best.  I do think it maybe a good place for happy hour drinks as the atmosphere is nice ."}
{"text":"Went to La Parilla on Speedway last night.  Family visiting from Ohio.  We were not disappointed.  Food was excellent, and plenty of it, even for a couple of teenage boys.  Tony, our waiter, was right on.  The Mariachis, as a finishing touch were wonderful.  Thanks for a great meal and a lot of nice memories for the Ohio clan.   Bette P"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late-night itch for some Mexican food, so with the restaurant being so close to the freeway we decided to dine in.  Nice ambience.  Our main entrees were delicious (both got the corn tamal), however we were a little dissapointed that we had to ask the waitress for chips/salsa and for utensils after our entrees were given to us. Overall, the food was delicious - hopefully next time around our waitress and/or host will be a little more prepared."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with the whole family. We love Mexican food!  First impression was not that good. If the hostess worried about the customers as much as she did about her hair & make it would dramatically improve the \"Welcome\"  feeling you get. She then proceeded to seat us (5 adults, 2 kids) in a booth. A booth in which the car seat of our 2 month old would not fit. She told us to just put the car seat on the table.... Anyway, after that whole situation we received the chips & salsa. They were really good! 3 different types of salsa, heck yea!  Food soon followed, and I really enjoyed it. Service with our waiter continued to be slow, but the food was great! Prices were a bit high, average was $12.  I will return, but it's not going to be a \"go to\" for dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and attentive service.  Every time we visit the valley we make a point to eat here a time or two.  My favorite dish is the #42. Wonderfully done steak, tangy chorizo, and melting cheese all on your own wood-fired serving tray.  This with great tortillas and their El Charro beans makes the perfect meal that I dream of when I'm away!  Mexico City style Mexican food gets no better than this!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican restaurant. Try the signature tortilla soup with avocado and sour cream.   FYI: They smash bacon into their beans so if you're vegetarian, be sure to ask them for beans without bacon smashed into them. The staff is usually pretty accommodating.   Great for big groups. They have a mariachi band on Friday and Saturday nights so it can get a bit loud."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start, the drinks are decent and the chips and salsa is good but the food is tasteless and borderline nasty. It was my clue to get  up and leave once I saw the menu and each food item has a number by its name, that should have been all I need to get up and leave at that time!   The steak and chicken tacos had grease dripping from them, the rice was tasteless and dry and the chicken was like rubber. Another clue should have been to run away is when I pulled up at 5pm and the place was empty. Please avoid this place by all means!! Go to Taco Bell for much better meal experience."}
{"text":"I have not been there in a long time but thought I would do lunch there today. I was seated promptly. Waited about 5 minutes til the server showed up. Waited a little longer from my drink. Ordered a simple lunch item. Then I waited and waited and waited I had been there about 20 minutes by then. I decided to wait another 10 minutes and did. Still no food. No server ever said they would check on my order or anything else. Four people across from me can in a little before me and where served. They had a large order. I do not know if the food is any good I never got to to try it. I finally left after being there for 45 minutes. Will I come back? I doubt it will I recommend it I doubt it."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here.  The delicious green avocado salsa is gone and the Chillaquilles were more like nachos with the tortilla chips remaining crunchy.  Service was top notch however."}
{"text":"Best green sauce ever! Fajitas used to be better. It's almost like they are pre making them and keeping them warm. Not the crowds that used to frequent this restaurant because of above reason."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. Start off with a trio of fresh salsas & chips. Seemed like a great start to a good meal. Service seemed slow. Dinning room not to full of patrons @ lunchtime.  I was suppose to have ordered one of their daily special they had offered. The Enchiladas Suizas but was served the Pechuga Suiza. After getting the attention of or server I referenced to the obvious. She apologized however didn't offer to correct it: so I just opted to get a side of the sauce that was suppose to go over my enchiladas. The mini quesadilla had large pieces of chicken inside two dry flour tortillas and the only cheese on it was \" on top\" just a sprinkling of melted mozzarella. Served with a very small portion of shredded lettuce & a side of refried beans. You can only choose rice OR beans with your meal. BTW it come on the side in a separate small dish.  Felt my meal was very bland and pricey for what you receive.  My friend loves their fish tacos, they looked good -but I personally wasn't impressed with the entire experience."}
{"text":"Disappointed. 6 of us, started out ok, service went from ok to horrible. Halfway thru the meal we couldn't find wait staff, or management. Then a glass shattered and reception gave us a mop then hunted for help to clean up. Took 5 minutes. They never cleaned the table of shattered glass, nor did management check on us. Mind you the restaurant was maybe 20% full on a Saturday night, so crowds weren't a problem. They added 15% to the bill, and for the first time ever, we wanted it taken off. then again, management was missing. Can't even relate to the food, the experience was so bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and we are leaving very happy! The food was great! I had the chicken flautas and my husband had the #10 lunch special. We are stuffed and we enjoyed it all. The small pitcher of Cadillac margaritas was fantastic and seemed to go on forever. And honestly, it's not the most modern or updated place but who cares as long as it's clean and the food is good!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Can't wait to go back! Their menu is HUGE! I told my husband we will have to visit this place often so I can try everything! Good prices, great service (we had 2 waiters), the food came so fast we had barely sampled our drinks, and it was excellent tasting food! Rustic, casual ambiance. It was a bit loud, but that's how it is when a bunch of people know where to get great food!"}
{"text":"I love La Parilla Suiza. It's a Mexican City type thrown down!!!  I haven't been to their other locations in Phoenix only this one but I continue to be blown away by their level of hospitality and the taste and diversity of their food. This was a favorite lunch spot of mine when I live in Phoenix and I make it a point to visit each time I swing by town.   Some of my favorites:  Queso Suizo---plainly put...Melted gooey cheese with torillas. A great start! It does take some time to make so be patient...It's sooooo worth it!  Chicken Enchiladas Suiza with their green sauce-YUM. I have attempted to order this at other joints only to be sorely disappointed that it it didn't have the tangy-ness of this plate. It's seriously heavenly good!  Bistek Tacos-The meat is flavorful and perfectly cooked. Its the type of beef that's marinated and cooked to perfection that you don't need any sauces or condiments to hide the taste. It's melt in your mouth bomb diggity.  Simplicity on a plate.   Chips and a variety of salsas are always on the table...sip on a margarita and you're in the good.   And order the flan....WOW!  I'm sure anything else your order there is good and I would put my stamp of approval on it any day. But, sometimes I can be a creature of habit and order my go-to dishes.  The service is always top notch. They have always been hospitable and efficient, even if your running off a lunch hour.   Go! Go! Go!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my husband on a Monday afternoon. Ordered the chicken enchiladas con mole. Very delicious! The waitress was excellent. Their salsas are wonderful too.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you grew up on the west side of town and your family had any knowledge of decent Mexican food, you definitely know La Parrilla Suiza on 35th Avenue and Peoria. Luckily for a childhood friend and I, we were able to find one on this side of town.   Let me preface this with saying the atmosphere is much more open than the original La Parrilla - you will never sit by the kitchen and sweat like can happen in Phoenix.   Then the food. I have always loved their food - mostly the parrilladas - the large skillets with meat, cheeses, and vegetables, but I wasn't too hungry that day since we had already eaten the queso fundido with mushrooms, and a staple you can never miss: the chips with the tray of salsas to choose from.   I ordered a small chicken quesadilla ... that is not what it was really called, but I can't recall the name. As usual, the food was great. The cheese was amazing, the tortillas even better, and the charro beans amazing.   Trying to get out of the Mexican food funk? Try La Parrilla and I guarantee you and your family will be going there 16 years later like I am."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  After we went to the movies it was dinner time so we went across the street to La Parilla Suiza.  We were greeted and seated and then about 10 mins went by before our server came to take a drink order.  Chips and salsa had been placed on the table but no water or drink orders taken.  Our server did not seem all that enthusiastic.  She seemed as though she was just going through the motions.  I told her it was our fist time there so she pointed out some house specialties and then went to get out drinks.  I saw they had chilequiles on the menu and I love them and not many places serve them.  When I placed my order our server seemed a bit suprised I didn't order one of the higher priced specialties.  Our food arrived and it was hot and the chilequiles were good.  We were never offered more chips and only checked on once during the meal.  The food was fine but the service was lacking, in my opinion.  If I was in the area again I would go back and give them another chance.  Everyone is entitled to a bad day."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like live mariachi music?!  La Parrilla Suiza has a live strolling mariachi band on the weekends, so that gives this place another star in my book.  You'll also feel like you're actually dining in Mexico thanks to the decor and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.  The food is really good too- my favorites so far have been the cheese enchilada's, chimichanga and fajitas.  Oh and if you're a dipper, chips come with three different salsas!!"}
{"text":"Have been back a couple of times.  Service is still on the slow(er) side, but damn, the food is good, and the beers are cold."}
{"text":"Our party of five arrived mid-afternoon for a late lunch.  We were seated at a booth that included old crushed chips underneath the table and chunks of meat scattered on the floor.  Once our food arrived (yes, we stayed to eat...) we had to ask for utensils.  The food was bland overall, although the enchiladas were covered in a greasy pasta sauce (possibly Ragu).  Mexitalian anyone?  Upon leaving we visited the restroom, which appeared untouched by a cleaning agent for an unreasonable amount of time.  Considering we were one of only a few people in the restaurant at the time, the bathrooms should have been clean and our table certainly should have been set."}
{"text":"I see some reviewers have given this place low scores because they are not selling Sonoran food. Hey, you people, it says in big letters on the building MEXICO CITY CUISINE.It is not a Sonoran Restaurant. Its like people ordering spicy Thia food or hot wings and then complaining about the spice. Thanks to these sorts of people restaurants end up dumbing down their food to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Stop it. Go to Taco Bell if that's what you want.  Anyway, this is the third location of La Parrilla Suiza I have visited, the first was Tucson and the second was the 35th Ave. location. Nice looking place. The food was more or less as I remember it, though the chorizo might have been a little less tasty. Their chips and salsas are awesome so be careful not to fill up on those before your food comes. Prices are in line with most other casual dining places. They also have a really nice bar inside. Service was also very good.   If you want a change from the typical Sonoran give this place a try."}
{"text":"Good Mexico City food but sometimes the service is suspect.  Nice to find a menu that isn't just the played out typical standards the margies can be fantastic.  So if you want your atypical fare this is the place but make sure your schedule is freed up for an hour or so."}
{"text":"It has not started well. My booth back is broken so I have lean foreward. The wall along side us had large sections of paint pesled off, its dirty, and seems to be falling apart. To start of with My drink came out wrong and was sent back. My wife got a strawberry  margarita and it is watered down, low alcohol, no salt on glass. Basically the margaritas are trash. It is not happy hour so there is NO excuse for bad drinks. I ordered the Chimichanga my wife the shredded beef burrito. Hopefully the food is better than the impression so far of eating in a dump. Just realized we did not get silverware. I got it from another table seemed to piss off the server.   Got food finally. My wifes burrito the tortilla was so old and stale it's cracked all over, the beef is dried out, and is extremely low quality. My chimichanga for a fried item is completely soft. Might be baked. Low quality food. Seems old pre made. Nothing has that fresh made taste. I have eaten food all over the USA, parts of Mexico, and overseas when I say this is just bad food. You get a decent amount of the bad food. But bad is bad.  One last thing I feel I must add on to this. If you are Hispanic you will get treated much better. Having watched the 3 white people  tables get there food, drinks, and everything else slammed down. We also all got mass attitudes from our waitresses when they bothered to come by. Speak a bit of Spanish and you get 2 or 3 waitresses helping your table. Suddenly  they are nice and helpful. Yes very different service. Also if you check out my pic I added if the waitresses have the time to play games on their phones and screw off they can defiantly provide better service or even clean this filthy place."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexico City style Mexican food restaurant! Best chips and salsa! My favorite restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"If you're expecting the same exact Sonoran style food at every other Mexican place, LPS isn't for you.  If you're looking for the best Mexico City style food, you're home. I always thought it was excellent,  but took a coworker from Mexico City and she agreed!"}
{"text":"I'll give it three stars for the food only. Service was awful!!! Also, I believe the AC was not working because it's hotter than hell in there. Our sever walked by our table (once) asking if everything was ok, and my reply in one sentence was \"yes can we get some napkins?\" And he just kept walking. I'm pretty sure I could of said no and he still would have not stopped which tells me he didn't really care. He took our water glasses and brought them back with no straws. He brought us food but gave us no utensils. Our whole meal we needed napkins, straws, and I had to flag him down for a drink. My tacos were amazing and the salsa was great. That would be why I come back, thanks to the chefs!! Can I tip them instead?"}
{"text":"Terrible service.... over priced and not authentic mexican... everything tasted frozen or out of a can.... by far the worst I have expirienced from any chain in az."}
{"text":"The best chilaquiles I have had!  I even needed a to go order so I could eat more later.  I am still thinking about them....I will be back for them!  Save me some!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the La Parrilla Suiza restaurants in Tucson.  This branch located in Phoenix is similar but misses the mark compared to its sisters down south.  I have come here a couple of times and both times, service was fine.  The food however seemed to lack the freshness that I was accustomed to from the Speedway and Oracle locations in Tucson.  I REALLY like those restaurants and are some of my all-time favorites.  Part of the issue aside from freshness (of the salsas for instance) was the booths.   They are very compact it seems.  I am not a big guy at all but I felt crampt in the booths.  The back of the restaurant isn't as lively or bright as the other restaurants.  Although you can see the cooks in the kitchen, they are enclosed in a wall of glass or plastic that makes it feel like you're in a zoo.  Overall, not bad...certainly not terrible, just not the \"authentic\" La Parrilla that I am used to."}
{"text":"Food was bland and pricey... service slow... started with chips and salsa trio so it was off to a good start, but the food was just not impressive. Service was subpar."}
{"text":"Read this for free entertaiment at my expense!  I ordered a taco dish that offers the choice of chicken or beef. My waiter did not ask wh2at I wanted and brought me beef when I wanted chicken. I did not think to specify, and feel that the waiter should have asked, not just bring me whatever!! The beef was a bunch of very tiny cuts that were burnt and super tough! I had to spit out bite after bite because I couldn't chew it, even will a full set of healthy chompers!  I ordered an extra side of rice. It didn't come with my meal. I asked for it and was told it would be right out. When it didn't arrive, I asked a second time. It didn't arrive...EVER!!!!  We were there for almost two hours as the service was SLOW!!!! When the bill came, we didn't even complain or ask that the price of the rice be removed from the bill BECAUSE:  AT THIS LOCATION, THE MANAGER IS A *BLEEP*!!! She will lose her temper and act like a crazy nut and tell you to never come back if you complain!! She is scary!! You will question whether she has surveillance watching you as you leave in order to get your license plate so she can send a mobster to your house to rough you up!! NEVER in my life have I been afraid of a restaurant manager! Holy crap Batman!!!   One little question will set her off. I ordered takeout for the first time. When I got home, there was no hot sauce with my order. I called to ask, for future reference, if they usually include hot sauce, and she yelled at me, \"Unless you spend $10.00, you don't get hot sauce!\" I responded that it would be nice if they told me and gave me the opportunity to pay for some. I told her my food tasted like Taco Bell, and she screamed, \"Our food is nothing like Taco Bell!!!!\" I responded that mine tasted like Taco Bell because I had to use Taco Bell sauce on it. She cussed me out and told me to \"Never come back!!!!\"  There are more instances with this crazy lady, but I know if a review is too long, people won't read it.  I encourage the owner to contact me for more details!!! The manager needs to be on medication or get rid of her!!"}
{"text":"This place earns it's stripes.  The food is fantastic. The service is wonderful. The staff actually remembers you if you come in a second time.  And if you like cheese, well, this is kind of a cheese nirvana.  The food is not boxed and quartered into the familiar bland Mexi of other Arizona digs and actually offers dishes that are interesting."}
{"text":"When I lived in Arizona ( from age 5 to 30), I ate at La Parilla Suiza a lot, at several of their locations. This is the one closest to my childhood home, and I think it was the prettiest of the restaurants. My mamma and I used to eat lunch there. My dad and his third wife liked it too ( but not with my mom, of course).... anyway, ahem.  I love their melty cheese and mushroom appetizer, their chips and salsas, their tamales and enchiladas.. and the fajitas.   In college a Latino friend of mine took me to eat fajitas at the one in Tucson near the U of A campus, and I was busy forking chicken and peppers into my tortilla ( daintily, like a lady) when he took my fork away, put a tortilla in my hand, and said \"no, LIKE THIS!\" and demonstrated how to grab the stuff in the tortilla.   I have to admit, it was faster and more fun.   The fajitas are typically really really good, across the board.   I miss LPS and as much as I try to emulate their fajitas in my home, it's not the same. they do a great job. If you get to Phoenix or Tucson, give it a try. MMM.   Oh, and the tortilla soup, to die for. Really.  P.S. They catered my dad's wedding to his wife, and the food was fabulous."}
{"text":"First time here, good food wonderful service. Manager came over and introduced himself very impressive. Loved our first visit defiantly will come back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food you can get!   My family and I come here regularly and it is always great!   They have the best tortilla soup, homemade tortillas, and awesome alambre tacos.  Service was a little slow,  but they made up for it by giving us free dessert, fried ice cream,  YUM!"}
{"text":"Not impressed!! Service was horrible, 10 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Another 10 minutes to get or drinks. 25 minutes for our food to come out. The beef on our quesadilla was excellent the charo beans were as well. However everything else lacked flavor and was cold."}
{"text":"This place was ok. It was recommended to us from a friend who knows authentic mexican cuisine. When you first arrive they bring you out chips and 3 different types of salsa (green, spicy red, and pico de gallo). They are all pretty good. I ordered the cheese enchiladas and asada taco combo and it was ok. I really liked the enchilada sauce, it's definitely not your canned version in most restaurants around here. The tacos weren't the best. The beef seemed kind of dry. Although the tortillas were homemade. Warning: This place only gives you one free drink refill before they charge you for another drink and it's like 2.25 or something....weird. They also only give you one chip refill before they charge you 1.99 and they don't give a lot of chips."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times while living in Arizona. When I first came I was impressed. The salsas are all amazing, especially the green one! The portions are HUGE! Enough to feed a small village. Nice Mexican restaurant decor. They have TVs to watch games. This is good Mexican food in Arizona. I will be coming back here when I visit."}
{"text":"So I have been to the location in Tucson and now experienced this one and I have to say that I did not have a WOW or YUMMM drooling moment at either. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible it just has no wow factor at all to me and I will pass next time.  There is just better Mexican cuisine out there,,,   Service was promt though!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but service and prices are great. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Been 3-4 times, Good food for most part.  Better than garcias  across street.  Only bad thing is last time saw some roaches, pretty gross."}
{"text":"Worst. Customer. Service. EVER.   I was supposed to meet my family here after my son's high school graduation.  By the time I got out of the parking lot it was 9:30, and I called to say I was on my way.  Even though the sign on the door says open until 10:00, the manager informed my party that they were locking the doors in 5 minutes and I would not be allowed to enter.   So thanks La Parilla Suiza for ruining my son's graduation dinner. The quality of the food is irrelevant when you treat customers like crap. This is the second negative customer service interaction I have had with them.  Will not be giving them any more of our business."}
{"text":"I've been to both the North Phoenix and Mesa location and the experience was about the same.  The service was lackluster, and there really wasn't that many customers in the restaurant.  The thing I found to be the worst was that the food I got was COLD!    One of my friends loves this place but I believe it's because of the salsa not the service or the atmosphere.  I recommend anything but this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I worked here as a hostess for a little over 2 years and never got sick of the food! Talk about real authentic Mexican food! Garcia's, Serrano's, and Macayo's have nothing on this spot. When you first sit down, you get served chips with 3 different salsas (the green is my fave!). The green chili enchilada sauce is amazing and the tortilla soup makes for a great hangover remedy! They also have great combination plates and parrilladas! For dessert, I would definitely recommend the sopapillas with honey! Part of me wishes I could still eat their food every day! I give them 4 stars only because they got rid of the weekend mariachi group."}
{"text":"Food, excellent as always. I've been dining here for nearly 20 years. Service, horrible. Last night was the worst I've ever experienced there. Lots of waiters doing nothing, managers holding up the bar, maybe one busser in the restaurant. Took forever to get a water. Took forever to be followed up with. Oh, and when you order an appetizer isn't it supposed to come before the main course? 2 stars for this visit, and that's only due to the cooks doing their job right."}
{"text":"Today was the last time I'll ever go to La Parilla Suiza.   #1, and most importantly, they don't offer the green sauce anymore with chips. They sold me on that 20 years ago during my first visit and it was one of the only reasons I went out of my way to one of the LPS restaurants. The waitress today said they don't have it anymore, period. Their replacement is a green salsa which is meh.  Went for lunch today because we had a craving for the green sauce and the #5 (cheese for 2). The #5 was great as always, but that alone won't retain our business. The taco on the lunch menu was not really a taco. At least I didn't expect 1 street taco with a cheese enchilada on the menu. It was 1 small corn tortilla with a little meat, nothing else. See pic.   Music was so loud and disruptive, couldn't hold a conversation at the table.  The location in Phoenix closed, not surprising as there was never anyone at either location. Website says stay tuned for new location.  I won't return unless you bring back the green sauce.   Service is never fantastic, see a previous review at Phoenix location.   Based on previous reviews, and what I saw today...nobody goes to this location anymore so it's only a matter of time before the Mesa location closes.  Even if you bring back the green sauce for a small fee, let me know. I'll pay.  Oh and one last thing, I swear their beans are the Rosarita beans in a can at the grocery store. I've always thought that. Go buy a can, sprinkle a little white cheese on top and you'll see."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here quite a bit and I just realized that I haven't written a review. We actually held our wedding reception in there back room. They serve great food from Mexico City. Our preferred server is Enrique!!!! He is awesome and takes great care of us. Everyone is very nice and Jorge the manager is very awesome to work with. The prices are great as well."}
{"text":"Service was the worst!  Hire a busboy, people! The PV location was a regular place for us. Here, the staff was slow the food was slow being served and had obviously sat on the line for awhile. And there was a grand total of six tables in the whole place. Really bad. Very disappointing. I watched our server come out of the kitchen with food, go to the bar with it, do something to it, then go back in the kitchen and bring it to the dining room and serve it. Horrendous! I guess we'll have to get our La Parilla fix in Tucson - if I can even bare to cross the threshold again. We definitely won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The food I got at this place is the best Mexican food Ive ever eaten in the valley. I ordered some steak tacos and chicken soup and everything was perfect. High quality Mexican food. Will come back definitely."}
{"text":"I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago.  The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times.  The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant.   The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time. The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go.  The food simply stank.  Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish.  (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted)  Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better.    My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit!  I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore.    I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meals immensely!  Every item was flavorful. Chicken enchilada , chicken flautas, chicken fajita all  excellent. Dessert was amazing!  Flan and churros were so good. We would recommend La Parilla Suiza  to anyone looking for a good Mexican meal.   Only thing is our guests would have appreciated a mild sauce."}
{"text":"What a waste of time/money. The menu pictures of the food look delicious, but what I got was completely different!!!!!   I wanted it to be tasty....but I got some slapped together shrimp tacos with...white rice? White rice and butter. Crunchy..BLEH.  I was expecting lots of shrimp for the expensive plate I bought. I got tiny little shrimpies....DON'T DEPRIVE ME OF MY SHRIMP! I love shrimp. Anyway, so bland....no flavor....so LITTLE food....I am not one to eat a lot, I just was expecting a bigger portion for what I paid for  I feel like a jerk every time I rate a place low. But The thing is, when I dislike something, the first thing that comes to my head is: I gotta tell other yelp about my terrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants. Great service and the food is well cooked and presented. Nice atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"It is an upscale Ameri-Mexican chain that is well runed by attendative staffs as well as favorites of Mexico.  It is slightly higher than a typical Mexican restaurant so I would describe it as BF Chang of Mesa.  Good choice for novice Mexican foodie.   No tongue or tripe or fat cheek meat that I love.  Decent experience."}
{"text":"Been going to this establishment for years; since 1987.  Albeit mostly the original location in NW Phoenix, but I have been to this Mesa location 4 times.  This restaurant is going downhill.  Food is getting worse and the portions smaller.  Further, customer service sucks!  Although the prices are reasonable, the food is mediocre at best.  You are better off eating at the food courts of the Mexican oriented grocery markets - at least the foods there are more authentic and tasty."}
{"text":"Long overdue review as this has been a favorite here, and in Tucson, for many years. For edification, \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine can be a  nebulous and misleading generalization. There are many different regional varieties from northern, central and southern Mexico. Most of the Mexican restaurants in AZ are of the northern ilk. La Parrila Suiza is Mexico City cuisine and excellent at that. Nice place to bring the family or dine at the ample bar if solo. Several different combos to choose from; favorite is Parillada Mixta No. 39. Mixed grill of charbroiled beef strips two quesadillas and a bell pepper stuffed with cheese accompanied by chorizo and grilled green onions, all served on an individual little grill with mesquite charcoal underneath. Served with terrific soft corn tortillas; make your own tacos with a spoonful of cheese, chorizo and beef strips--killer!!  I eat the whole thing, but two could easily share this. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"After driving home from. Las Vegas we wanted to grab some Mexican food and sit down and have a Margarita. We checked out a few places on Yelp near our home that we had not tried yet,  and we're still open. This popped up and they were open until 10pm so we stopped in.   It was a Monday night 90 mins before closing so we weren't sure what to expect but there were a few others eating later as well. The restaurant is sit down and full service with many booths and authentic recorded music playing at a very nice level for conversing.   This is the cuisine of Mexico City and not your typical americanized version. The chips come with three salas and all were great. Chips thin and crispy just like I like them. We ordered a small pitcher of the house Margarita and we each got 2+ glasses out of it. Not too sweet or tangy...  just right.   I had the Carne Asada with cheese enchilada, rice and refried beans. Steak cooked medium was tender and juicy and not too much salt. The rice and beans nice and the cheese enchilada was not greasy and tasted very fresh and nice.   My wife had the Enchiladas Suizas and chose to have one of each (beef, chicken and cheese) and all were very tasty and fresh as well. This plate came with Ranchero beans and she loved those too.   Our server was very attentive but not overly so. She let us sit and enjoy.   We will definitely be back and try more items on the menu. This was a great first visit."}
{"text":"We came here from looking for a Sam's Club to spend our rewards money we got since ours was already closed down in Alaska.  It is far from where we are staying in Scottsdale and since it is Cinco de Mayo we thought of Mexican food.  Food in pictures  in yelp are not what I saw put on the table from other guest sitting in restaurant.  It is a typical mexican restaurant with OK food.  The salsa and chips were good but was really spicy.  I kind of lost my appetite after visiting the restroom before eating to wash my hands, the restroom was dirty and stinky even my 9yr old daughter didnt even want to use it.  I always have this thought that if they cant keep a restroom clean how much more their kitchen.  I think the place needs to be updated and deep cleaned."}
{"text":"Had the steak fajita quesadilla, which was good, no doubt about it. However the service was awful. We got chips and salsa but the girl who served us brought a bowl of broken chips..I mean - seriously broken up, can't dip into salsa - broken chips. When we asked for new ones, she brought a new bowl and just put some unbroken ones on top and left the bottom portion full of broken chips. She also didn't want to bring us any more salsa without charging for a pint of it. Barely got extra water..she was quite surly by the end. Ladies bathrooms were quite unclean. I won't be going back.. I have had the same rude experience at another location at the PV Mall area. Frankly, the decent food doesn't make up for the lousy and surly service."}
{"text":"2nd time my wife and I have eaten at La Parrilla Suiza.  There will NOT be a third time.  Food was below par and service was terrible."}
{"text":"I've been coming going to the Mesa location for years and this is my first time to this location but again everything was good. I usually get a Parillada Suiza and tortilla soup. Best tortilla soup ever. Service was also great"}
{"text":"What you need to know is that this is NOT a standard Mexican joint.  You may find some names similar to what you can get at Macayos or Garcia's or heck, even the wonderful Carolina's.  This isn't Sonora cooking the way we know it, and it's not Tex-Mex either.  This is Mexico City food.  Go as often as you want - no passport required.  Let's start with the feel of the place.  It's on the corner of a strip mall, but it's behind a bank building so you can't see it from the street.  Once you go inside, you might forget you're in a strip mall across from a suburban mall (Paradise Valley Mall).  There are custom brick and stone archways dividing the entrance and midway through the restaurant.  Great copper work along the wall that has a window into the kitchen, highlighting the copper plates above the window ledge.  There is a mural on the wall over the ample sized bar area that is an homage to Diego Rivera's work.  In shelves, and over the archways there are other pieces of pottery, tile work and other pieces that really set the stage.  They also have a great outdoor seating area off of the bar with overgrown climbing plants providing shade in the summer and heaters for colder nights.  There are several scattered TVs that are both viewable from most tables but are easily ignored.  Most nights it is soccer - of course.  You'll be brought chips and 3 dippers, a green tomatillo sauce, a great chunky salsa and a red sauce that has a nice spice to it, but I can't quite place the flavor.  Next, you'll notice the menu.  The last time we went my dining companion notices how many items were made with bacon.  You'll also find lots of great meals that I haven't seen served at other restaurants.  In my years of coming here, I haven't been disappointed by a dish yet.  Some items are similar, but different. Enchiladas are almost square shaped and come in a small dish.  Fajitas don't come in a skillet, which continues to cook and burn the edges, but in a large heating pan that you'd imagine seeing on a buffet line.    Average meal price is about $12 and worth every penny.  Deserts are also wonderful - but it's been quite awhile since I was able to make it to dessert.    La Parilla is really great if you're in the area - and even good if you had to drive a bit to get there."}
{"text":"I've been here three times so far and the last time I came here, which was last night, it was terrible. The previous visits were okay but last night's dish sucked ballz. I got the carne asada burrito which consisted of dry carne asada meat inside of a flour tortilla. No sauce, no cheese, no nothing. It was so dry! I mean really? Put some kind of thought into it. And it was  $11.50 for that. The pinto beans that they had in a cup on the side had a strange taste to them, too. The waitress was a ding bat and had no other suggestions for us when all they had were regular highchairs from 1930 that don't accommodate modern infant carriers, which we ended up having to set on the ground. How about offering to get us a chair to set it on? Idiot. Yea, I won't be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. The food was ok, but I have had better at other local eateries. I guess my expectations were set so high that I was expecting the WOW factor, and it definitely did not deliver.  Probably won't return, just because there are so many other good choices."}
{"text":"This place is overrated,  the food is NOT authentic at all.  California is where the real Mexican food is."}
