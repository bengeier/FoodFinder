{"text":"Wanted to try this restaurant as we live nearby and couldn't figure out where to park. Finally we went around to the back and found only valet parking. We went to Rosie McCaffreys instead"}
{"text":"The food was meh....

The parking is unacceptable, zero self parking....

The service in the patio was terrible....

Would not go back..."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese was tasty.  I had the \"Wang Chung Tonight.\"  The pulled pork was tasty with big chunks of meat, cooked just the right amount.  The Asian-inspired slaw is what made my sandwich - nice and sweet and the vegetables had the crunch and freshness that lightened up the somewhat heavy sandwich.  I liked the tomato soup, but I didn't care for the chips which were a bit overcooked.  Next time I come back, I will pursue my options to swap out the chips, as other reviewers have indicated that the sides can be substituted.  The beer list was very comprehensive, with a variety of styles and a good representation of both local and national microbrews.  Friendly staff - had some good conversation with them about the various brews and microbreweries.  The main thing I will change next time is to learn about the different sides."}
{"text":"The bottomless \"mimosas\" had little if any Champange in them. Spent 16 dollars for orange juice"}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing at this place... This place totally has potential to be a 5 star however, service isn't too great... I made a reservation in the picnic area for my husbands birthday initially but somehow  they lost that reservation and allowed our party of 20 to move inside.., I was told we were going to sit together but we were highly disappointed when we were seated at our awkward back to back tables. A couple of friends ordered 2 beers and when they ordered their 3rd, the waitress made them drink water before serving him his 3rd... I had never heard of such a rule. When he confronted her about it, the server went ahead and told my guest that he was a  douche (NOT COOL). Other than the terrible service, we were impressed by the food and drinks, the ambiance is amazing and it is a great place to have a good time with good people!"}
{"text":"Good concept.  I was really looking forward to trying this place.  Stopped by early on a Saturday night for dinner.  Draft selection is awesome.  Menu looked great with lots of options.  Started off with the \"yard-chos\", which are just Yard's clever name for nachos.  Got some generic bagged chips with some gloppy \"beer cheese\" and some decent pico de gallo on top.  Nothing special.  I ordered one of their giant grilled cheese sandwiches that had a Big Mac type of burger concoction in it.  The sandwich looked great, but it got to me lukewarm at best, maybe it sat in the pickup window too long.  The stuffed grilled cheese sandwich is a great idea (Melt in Cleveland, OH does an excellent version of them).  Yard's version melts the cheese while grilling the bread and then stuffs the sandwich, which makes the sandwich a little lackluster.

Great concept, average execution at best."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  Food was very mediocre and restaurant management overall poor.  Our server, however was good. Wings not done, nachos were bland and small. We will try new restaurants to try to promote the downtown area.  This was a mistake. Save your money!"}
{"text":"It's been great each time I've come here. Little Cleo's is fantastic and the staff had been excellent each time we've gone in. I really liked the octopus."}
{"text":"couldn't wait to try this place from the time i heard they were turning the motorcycle dealer into a \"beer garden\".  Food was so-so, drinks way over-priced and the atmosphere was noisy and very impersonal - not at all the \"beer garden\" atmosphere i was expecting. The \"yard\" area leaves a lot to be desired as there is no organization to the games...where do you go to check out equip? no one around to ask, no signs, nada.  The parking?! a complete nightmare - negative 10 stars on that point.  Probably won't be going back, too many other nice, convenient places opening in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is good!

If you're looking for a good place to socialize and enjoy some drinks with friends, definitely give the Yard a try.

The food is really good. I recommend the Mac Burger... and you can't go without the Pretzels and fondue. For Real.

My only complaints are that the parking for the area is pretty much only valet. And this place gets busy too, so sometimes the service is slow.

But overall, a really good find."}
{"text":"In all, I was just whelmed. The food was underwhelming and the ambiance was somewhat overwhelming but fun. I had one of their hamburgers and it was meh. The parking was terrible, there is literally no choice but to valet but at least that made it easy. I liked the outdoor seating and the brown bag beer special is fun. I'd go back if someone else chose it but I'm probably unlikely to choose it myself.

I give it four stars because its a fun concept but I just had higher (much higher) hopes for what it could be."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the central Phoenix area. I have always received great service. Went last week with a party of nine and we were seated right away.  I was there yesterday for lunch and the waiter was very friendly and helpful. I also love the food here."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago for my birthday and had a blast. The restaurant is beautiful. Super hip, comfy vibes. They have a huge patio where you can play cornhole, which is awesome, and a big wrap around bar. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and always great at suggesting cool drinks. The food is pretty pricey but super bomb. Only thing that really sucks is the parking situation."}
{"text":"Excellent place to hang out with great food and beer/liquor selections! Always a great recommendation if you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The hostess needs to be trained in customer service again she was very rude. I confronted her about it and still continued to be rude to me. I should of went to the manager. She needs to be fired."}
{"text":"We were in AZ for a volleyball tournament last week and decided to stop in The Yard on the recommendation of a sales clerk in WA who said we \"just had to eat here\".  We liked the place immediately. It had a great vibe and the waitress was friendly and quite helpful.  We ordered drinks, which were great.  I ordered the breakfast with bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast, none of which tasted all that great, but still we enjoyed hanging out there.  My husband had a shrimp salad which he said was very good.  Everything was great until a few hours later, when both my husband and I got diarrhea like nobody's business!  Not too big of a deal for my husband as he was one and done.  Unfortunately we had to catch a flight back to WA the same day.  Needless to say, that was a bad flight.  Every burp was a reminder of one of the worst meals I had in AZ.  I'm not one for reviews, and really wouldn't be writing one had it not been for the week-long after-effects of this experience.  I feel lucky to be alive as I swear I've never experienced such stomach pain in my life.  It was horrible.  The confusing part about this whole experience is that my husband and I had totally different meals and drinks, but still suffered the same diarrhea fate.  Will never, EVER, EVER eat there again, but would recommend it to my worst enemy for sure."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get invited to one of the soft openings at Culinary Dropout on Saturday night and really enjoyed it.  As I have lived in this neighborhood for many years, I have seen the space sit vacant, and they have made a great re-use of the spot.  They retained the huge awning and created a really cool outdoor space that includes fire pits, ping-pong tables, corn hole, foosball and some comfortable looking chairs.  We had a reservation and got their a few minutes early which gave us a chance to explore the space and even play a bit of ping-pong.  Now the food.  Started with a burrata appetizer that was very tasty.  I had steak and fries and my girlfriend had the meatloaf.  We both were pleased with our meals.  The drinks were also top notch, as was the service.  This place is within walking distance from my house and is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  They will be opening up a fish place/raw bar there in March, sharing some of the space with Culinary Dropout.  That will be great to have.  One thing they will probably have to fix, though, is the parking, which is reminiscent of Postino Central.  I am sure the neighborhood will be putting up some no parking signs real soon.  
Can't wait to walk there for brunch of of these weekends."}
{"text":"I was visiting friends in the PHX area and they suggested having dinner/drinks at The Yard - it was also their first time attending. 

First off, the valet parking is great - granted, we went on a Monday night, so not all that busy (I know some complained that the lot filled up - I would imagine that would be the case on weekends). 

We sat outside, which on most Arizona evenings is a must - it was extremely comfortable and open, and there is a roof that will protect you from any 'weather' - though in my brief stay there wasn't so much a cloud. Must be nice! 

Our waitress was quirky - but this is a quirky'ish restaurant - and was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We all got a different selection of beers - I had the Moose Drool, which is (I believe...) a Montana brewed beer, and one that I had been recommended by others - after I saw this, I sort of lost focus on the rest of the draught selection, but I think there was a good rotation of local and seasonal brews.

We split the pretzels w/ fondue as an appetizer (~12 bite sized pretzel cubes) - there was nothing incredible about them, but they were a fine compliment to our beers. I followed that up with a butternut squash cannelloni (although, I'm not Italian, but I don't think this was cannelloni - more like ravioli) that was really tasty, and surprising how flavorful and well done considering that The Yard comes across as being more pub food-centric. The other folks got the pub-food: a burger and grilled cheeses w/ bacon - everyone seemed pleased.

The Yard gets an extra star for the free entertainment. Again, I would imagine that the whole situation would be MUCH different on the weekend, but on a Monday night it was easy to play a game of cornhole with beer in hand (they also have table shuffleboard and ping pong) and not have to wait or feel cramped. It's a great place to go with friends to catch up and have a good time, and I was really appreciative of the fact that we weren't forced to close-out our tab with the waitress even after getting up after the meal to play the games - she came over and let us continue adding to our check.

I would definitely re-visit next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here last week for Sunday brunch. It was packed but the service was still  exceptionally fast. I'm the worst type of person and changed my mind about the bottomless bloody mary's I had ordered so my waiter kindly let me switch to mimosas without hesitation. It took forever to figure out what to order because they have so many options. I finally decided on a breakfast burrito and it was delicious. It was huge for the price and they give a side of potatoes. Everyone else either had something from the brunch menu or the grilled cheese options. I regretted my decision after I tasted my friend's buffalo mac n cheese grilled cheese. That sandwich is marriage material. 

The restaurant was a little loud and it was hard to hear everyone at the table at times, but that's expected of a popular brunch spot on Sundays. The friendly/fast service, amazing food, and mimosas made up for it. I think we found a new tradition for Sundays."}
{"text":"We would definitely come back and I was lobbying to go back sooner than later since we had such a great time out with our friends (who are also family). Great food, great drink, and a great time! 

PARKING:

It is Valet parking only or you need to park across the street. When you come in, they ask for your cell phone number and txt you when your table is ready. they also immediately send you a link to see your position in line on a web page. It was really cool.

WAIT TIME:

On a Saturday night the wait was about 45 min for the six of us. We went out the the giant patio area and walked right up to an empty table. I think they are hard to come by, but we lucked out.  We had a drink or two before being seated. 

BAR:

There are games, such as ping pong, corn-hole and shuffleboard, but we did not play any. they all looked busy and we were fine just talking.  

There is a small bar behind the games, but they only have 3 beers on tap and a few in cans, so we went to the main bar to get more choices...and they do have a TON of choices. you can also get a Brown Bag Special, which is basically they give you a beer like Hamms or Bush in a paper bag. Kind of funny, but I prefer Kilt Lifter, which they have along with a lot of other great beers. A really great thing about this place is the patio area is so big, you can get a drink and don't have to be standing shoulder to shoulder with other people like seems to be the norm at other trendy restaurants. 

The crowd ranges from teens to 50+, but certainly most are in the 20's and 30's.  Us, being in our 40's still fit in.  I suppose it would be ok to bring younger children, but there were none there. ...actually, I did see a woman walking a baby around. We also ran into a friend's teenage children, but I do not recall any other. 

RESTAURANT:

The restaurant was very nice. They had a live band that sounded great and was not too loud. We all tried each others food and we like it all. We were really impressed at how great the food was. 

FOOD:

The Pretzel fondue was to die for. A MUST have! 
The meatloaf was better than my mom's!  (Sorry mom.)
My wife and I shared the Pastrami Turkey (Turkey with seasonings on the outside like beef pastrami) with coleslaw on a pretzel bun. I would definitely get that again. REALLY good.
The mussels were just \"OK\". Not great, but not bad. The bread that came with them was really good."}
{"text":"Coolest bar I've ever been to (I'm from PA). Huge area. Good amount of tv's. Huge outdoor area for ping ping and cornhole. Cool outdoor fire pits. Two separate bars! Super friendly waitresses. I would go here every weekend if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.

Walked in and attempted to sit in a table section. The waitress said need to check in with the hostess and that there was a \"wait list\".  Very discouraging. Checked in and the hostess had us seated in 2 minutes.  Wait list? Really, waitress?  Really?

Once seated, ordered a Pomegranate Cider Beer.  Received a Pineapple cider beer. When I brought this to the waiter's attention, he returned 10 minutes later with a grapefruit beer.  I restated I ordered a pomegranate to which he tried to explain the PINEAPPLE (which is clearly labeled PINEAPPLE) was the POMEGRANATE.  Really?  I thought pomegranate was Red and not YELLOW!   

The place is about as busy as any other place for a Friday night.  Having worked food and beverage, the wait staff can use improvement in customer service and getting the order correct.

The hummus platter was fairly good but I still can't get past the idea that when you order one thing don't try to convince the customer that a Pineapple is Pomegranate.    

Parking is a nightmare in that area.  You cannot park in the lot without utilizing Valet."}
{"text":"Great place with depressing music and a broken drink system. It takes forever to get a drink and they need everyone present at the bar if you buy them a drink. The games are fun but I'm waiting for my check, as we speak, to get away from this music before I stab myself in the ear with a nacho"}
{"text":"The bartender literally wouldn't serve us even though we VOLUNTARILY surrendered our outside alcohol before we even entered the bar (without trying to be shady; we told the hosts we had two beer cans and gave them to them; how else should I dispose of this?). This bartender was a complete dick for no apparent reason and refused to even look us in the eye as he threw us out. Repeatedly. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the hosts (to whom I, again, voluntarily gave my full beer) were apologetic and actually tried to give me my beer back on my way out because it was \"90% full, ma'am.\" I did come in at 1am but in essence: nothing is worth the potential attitude of the bartender. I'll buy my drinks elsewhere. You lost a good tipper tonight, kids. Your loss.

PS (as the daughter of a small business owner)-- your bartender is the face of your place. You need to ensure they are the kind of person you want representing you. If this bartender is who you are..... you're the worst."}
{"text":"This restaurant Is fun and the food was delicious. You have to try the turkey pastrami sandwich it is amazing. I got mine with a side of their barbecue sauce and I just loved it."}
{"text":"Overall, I like it.  The place is ALWAYS packed and VERY loud!  You will have to scream over all the other voices and music to hear each other.  The food was pretty good but very overpriced.  Also, they have happy hour at the bar but not at the tables next to the bar?  What sense does that make?  We just walked over to the bar to order our drinks and brought them back to the table... Not my fault theres no room at the bar.  Most of the yard games were taken and waits were formed to play them... We managed to sneak in a table at ping pong."}
{"text":"Visited The Yard for the first time this weekend and was thoroughly impressed. Had some friends from out of town and everyone had a blast playing ping pong, cornhole, shuffle board, etc. Great atmosphere to accompany the tasty drinks. Looking forward to trying the food the next time we visit, but by all accounts this looks to be one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink for the younger crowd.  The service was the worst that I have experienced in a long while.  We ate at Lolas.  The food was horrible, the waiter was abrubt and inept, the manager did not seem to have s clue about what was happening in the restaurant.....so many better places to eat."}
{"text":"This place was hoppin' after work on a Friday.  The food was OK, not bad, not outstanding either.  Good selection of beers.  Surprisingly broad cross section of ages, young professionals to older folks like me.  Also some families."}
{"text":"The Blarney Stoner was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. It's basically ruined me as now, no matter how good everything else on the menu sounds, I don't think i'll be capable of ever ordering anything else."}
{"text":"The food is alright. It's culinary drop-out so admittedly what is served there isn't going to be a complete disappointment, but don't expect to get anything organic or grass-fed. 

They have a decent brown bag special with beers and the salads are alright. Little Cleo's can be pretty good too and I don't really consider that restaurant at the same level as CDO or part of this review. It's mostly just GMO products served by vapid, pretty \"hipsters.\" I should be completely fair because some of the employees are really good, decent people who just need to pay the bills, but on the most part employees seem to be Hollister and urban o' wearing zombies. Sometimes they care about the job, you'll get a really awesome server, and other times you get a kid who cares more about gossiping with their coworkers than actually work. 

As another fox concept restaurant, they basically exploit a trendy lifestyle without actually holding up to any of the values of the lifestyle they replicate. They don't recycle, and trust me, these restaurants produce so much waste. And as much as the yard does have plenty of bike racks, they could care less about being green, its all a facade, which irks me. You're also forced to vallet to play games and drink beer unless you find parking across the street. I think its due to the neighborhood complaining about people parking on their street, so if thats truly the case, then I guess so be it. In other cities it isn't so unusual, but still its flippin' Phoenix. 

Why can't such a conglomeration, who is immensely profitable, be a good guy for once and actually do something right for the environment. Maybe discount customers who ride their bicycles if you can't recycle. Which, again why don't they recycle? Or any of the chain restaurants in Phoenix? When I see all of these tiny, local restaurants take the initiative despite their lack of resources be mindful about their products and their waste, it's upsetting to see such a huge place, with so many resources, just continue to add to the problem instead of trying to solve it.

The only reason I give 2 stars is because it's a great concept and there are some outstanding people who work there, but thats all. When you get down to the it, all this restaurant wants is to be the most profitable, they could care less about the local community."}
{"text":"Not happy with the process to seat a large crowd.  No reservations available and a 3 hour wait.  We were told 90 mins.  The little girl up front did absolutely nothing to help and better yet, the manager could have cared less.  Wouldn't come back again if you paid me!!!"}
{"text":"The Caprese salad was the best I've ever had. It was very refreshing and the sangria offered by our server was delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife and we loved it! We had the Fried Green Tomatoes and Buffalo Chicken MacnCheese grilled cheese sandwiches upon suggestion of our server Derrick. He also gave us great recommendations on beer from their extensive draft list. The food was great and the garlic parmesan fries are delicious and a perfect place to catch a Pens game. Overall great food, beer, and service."}
{"text":"Meh - I wasn't impressed by much here.  A lot more lows than highs during our Saturday night dining experience.  We arrived and were told it would be about an hour wait for the two of us.  This was fine - we wanted to window shop.  We were added to the list and received the text message letting us know that we would be notified when our table is ready.  An hour passed and we didn't hear anything.  By this time, we were done window shopping and sitting by the fountain.  We noticed that there were several open tables in The Yard, so we walked upstairs to ask what was going on.  Hostess seemed very confused, as the lobby completely was cleared out, and there were at least 10 open tables by then.  We were not offered an apology, but were seated after we asked what was going on.  Second issue - it was so warm.  I'm always cold and I was sweating.  We placed our drink/food order immediately.  Food came out fast - one of the high points. However, our table did not have any silverware or napkins.  So we had to wait.  Food was OK - nothing to write home about.  We both ordered a grilled cheese sandwich - OK but extremely greasy.  Soup was good.  Chips were meh. Pountine was good.  Beer was great.  Awesome selection of beer.  At the end of the night, we had a decent time with OK food and great beer.  Then we got the bill.....Whoa! Expensive!  Not worth it.  Extremely disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"Our server was young Bruce Springsteen (you'll know William) and while he broke my heart he did a real great job doing so. Sometimes two hearts are not better than one."}
{"text":"Great Service and food.....Wings and Turkey Cristo was off the hook!!!!!! Will be back when in town..Thank You Megan Awesome Customer Service"}
{"text":"Greasy!!  The idea of their menu sounds great, but the execution is not quite living up to what I had hoped. I was amazed to find just how greasy the food was. It didn't take long for my napkin to become smeared with grease from wiping off my hands when I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.  Every single member of my family felt a bit queasy after dinner. 

Service was fantastic, and the environment was great. But unless you're used to greasy food, you might want to avoid this one. Instead, visit BRGR downstairs. Much better food."}
{"text":"I've been several times and as a general rule really enjoy The Yard for drinking and good times. I haven't been to Cleo's for the seafood, but am excited to give it a try. I think Culinary Dropout is basically good. The mussels are usually a strong performer and I will order them with a side of roasted tomatoes. Really, I think sitting at the bar and ordering the tomatoes and bread is a pretty good thing. 

What makes this place really a great addition to the neighborhood and Phoenix as a whole is the backyard area that offers both fun activities (ping pong, bean bags, etc.), drinks (I really like when the beer tent/stand is open) and good people watching. Be warned, taking advantage of the nice beer selection will eventually ruin your ping pong abilities.

Problems? Sure, everyplace has problems. The thing that really starts to wear on you after a little bit are the kids that take over the game areas. I get it, mom and dad want to go out and have a nice time and the yard has space that kids can (should they??? A much, much bigger question) run around. Fine. I'm just saying that there is some sort of chart or graph that could be developed incorporating: drinks consumed, relative parenting skill, time of day/night, propriety of having your kids at what transforms into more bar than restaurant and way more of both than playground. I'm no stat wizard so somebody will have to work out the details. I have had a kid running way beyond restaurant speed knock the (somewhat pricey) full beer out of my hand. His parents are officially out of the running for parent of the year.   

All told, The Yard is a great addition to what is becoming a very nice area for bars and restaurants near Bethany Home Rd."}
{"text":"Never again...went for a friends birthday and didn't realize how dressed up we needed to be! The drinks are extremely overpriced and if I wanted to go to Scottsdale i would. Definitely not the usual central Phoenix crowd. I liked that they had games but had no chance to play on a Saturday night. I can maybe see myself going back during a weekday, but probably not. There were also a lot of drunk guys constantly bumping in to people and dropping glasses."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for lunch with some of my coworkers for my birthday! I loved the food, the bread was cooked perfectly and I got the caprese sandwich with the tomato soup and chips. The flavor of the tomato soup was almost smoky in a really great way, it was so decadent but they gave you the perfect amount so it wouldn't fill you up too badly.  

Evan was our waiter, and he was really excellent! He answered all of our questions and was patient with us when we didn't quite know what we wanted. He always kept our water glasses full and even split up our checks after without any hesitation or confusion. Overall the food was awesome, the tomato soup was awesome, and the ambiance was fantastic! Definitely will be back for a happy hour or another lunch date. :)"}
{"text":"First off this place is in Market Square, so unless you work in the city there is no reason to even set foot in this establishment. I was nearly in tears when I realized I was not going to be able to find a parking spot with a 50 meter walking distance. But, as Winston Churchill once said, \"if you're going through Hell, keep going\". And so with that I embarked on one of the greatest parking expeditions since Mallory's assault on Everest. After my 17th time circling the square I finally witnessed the birth of Jesus Christ, as a fellow patron began ever so slowly leaving one of their coveted \"parking spots\". The birth of the universe happened quicker than this person trying to leave the parking spot. Now friends what I'm about to tell you will send chills down your spine. There are some that describe restaurant kitchens as organized chaos. This place is not that. As I walked to the men's room I looked left and saw the shit show that was the kitchen. There was more food on the ground and on the burners than actually on fucking plates. One deckhand was even texting the night away on his non-bacteria laced cell phone. DID YOU KNOW? Hand washing is the number one deterrent of food borne illnesses. This place didn't. I decided to continue on. Entering the bathroom I nearly spat blood when I realized it was cleaner than the kitchen. Keep calm, I thought. No need to make a scene. I walked out and stumbled back into my seat. One word to describe the food here. Grease. I ordered a plain Jane cheeseburger, asked for medium-well, it came back well-done. Obviously, Marco Pierre White wasn't working the kitchen that night. There was enough oil on the potato chips that it began borderline bending the laws of molecular chemistry. Here I thought, there are scientist working on breakthroughs refracting light to achieve camouflage and this fucking place had already discovered it. Should have just gone to the Mcdonalds down the street. Would have saved $20."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a Sunday afternoon playing ping pong, shuffleboard, or cornhole and drinking beer. Cold beer , shade and misters make it comfortable all day. Good food too!"}
{"text":"I read all the \"bad\" reviews and really didn't want to go but this is where my son wanted to have his birthday dinner so we went reluctantly and had one of the best times! Sorry that other reviews had such bad experiences but our server was great, friendly and quick, the restaurant itself was really cool to walk around and visit while waiting for food and see what game you wanted to play \"if you ate all your dinner\"! Our food was delicious, we ordered the ribs, nachos and grilled chicken sandwich and had plenty of food. Parking is valet only but it was worth the little extra, we arrived there at 5:45sh and only waited a few min before being seated and the place was pretty busy but not overly crowded and everyone we encountered were friendly and nice! I'd defin love to go back sometime and suggest reservations if you have a lot of people or plan a later time on a weekend Eve but have to make it 24 hrs ahead. Wish I could post video of server singing Happy Birthday he was terrific!!!"}
{"text":"I had trouble finding the front entrance, which was in the back of the building. There are 3 restaurants inside of this complex. For most of the evening, I spent the time at the center bar where I was able to eat and order drinks. These were the drinks I ordered:

After School Delight
Room Service
Tequila Sunrise

The food I had was
The pretzel fondue(very good)
and manchego, prosciutto and bread from the antipasto menu(amazing)

All were very good and I am definitely going there again."}
{"text":"Please use the valet.  This is an infill restaurant and  the neighbors have been adversely effected by the lack of parking for Culinary Dropout, can only imagine how horrifying it will be when all planned restaurants operating.  Please do not park in front of our houses, please do not drop your trash on our streets, please do not pee  or throw up on our rose bushes, please do not break into our cars, please try and avoid our children on their bicycles, please stop for the school bus,  red cones mean don't park at all....and when asked to move your car, please do not threaten the neighbors.  Expect a ticket for illegal parking.  Thank you in advance for your consideration."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese was a little expensive but good. However, the tomato soup tasted like someone mixed heavy cream into a jar of ragu spaghetti sauce.  Awful!!!"}
{"text":"What a Fun place!! Great energy and Fabulous staff! Thank you Kyle Struele for the amazing SOFT PRETZELS & PROVOLONE FONDUE!! WOW!! and Thank you Sean for the yummy drinks! We Will be back for SURE!"}
{"text":"Website is deceptive. Happy hour only at the bar. Waitress over charged us after she brought us extra chips and then charged us $2 for them."}
{"text":"Waitress was very friendly and provided great service. I was impressed with the fried green tomatoes grilled cheese sandwich and their selection of drinks was great. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of the outside. It's a great place to bring the family or go out with your friends. They have a wide variety of drinks and TV's so you can watch sports while you eat, drink, and play. It's also fun when they have a live band. I would not suggest eating inside. It is pretty loud and hard to hear people. The food is stratifying. Their pretzels and cheese fondue are a must have!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich,  great service, very busy and hard to hear but very quick service enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This place has been open less than two weeks, and I've been here three times already. What else do you want to know?

The food? Great. On my previous visits I had the Wang Chung Tonight sandwich (BBQ Chicken, Asian Slaw, Gouda), the Imperial Swine flatbread (BBQ Pork, Bacon, Gouda) - can anyone sense a trend?

Today I had the Mac Attack, amazingly light balls of mac and cheese, breaded and deep-fried with a creamy sriracha sauce. Also a cup of their remarkable housemade tomato soup. I also attempted a dessert called \"Cause We Got High\", which combines peanut butter, Nutella, bananas, Texas toast and marshmallow in a way that can only have been concocted while in that state.

The only reason this lost a star is because of today's overly attentive waitstaff. I know I'm a curmudgeon, but: 1) don't ask me how I'm enjoying a dish two minutes after you've already asked me; 2) don't bring me my check before asking, since I might like dessert; and 3) don't pick up every item on my table as I put them down (sugar packet, napkin, napkin wrapper). It's annoying."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them a half a star....Worst service I have ever had. Tried to make a reservation for a large party, and was told that they don't take reservations. Upon arrival we were told that we'd have a 30 minute wait. Then when the hostess was asked about our table nearly an hour later,  the waiting time was changed to 2 hrs. When I asked the hostess there about reservations, she told me at that time, they only took 4 reservations a night. Ridiculous. Not to mention the bar staff and hostesses were very rude and condescending. Also, it was really difficult to talk to people standing right next to you because the music was so loud. 

The food was just meh...not worth $13 for an expensive chicken sandwich. And the drinks? Wtf! They are outrageously priced and don't even offer free soda for the DD.  So 2 drinks and a chicken sandwich cost me nearly $40 with tip. What a rip off. 

This is the 3rd time I have been to The Yard. Each time has been the same. The only redeemable point is that our server was nice.

Really, I don't get the hype about this place. 

Mediocre food, unwelcoming hosts and bar tenders, contradicting information, make me go broke prices and excessively loud does not make it a place I want to go back to.

So apparently the Yard is supposed to write me back...we'll see."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighboorhood!  A great covered patio with games, live music, great food and a central location.

I had the opportunity to visit the Yard twice in the same day.  And the experiences were night and day.  Come to think of it, those are the 2 times I was there...once for lunch and then later to meet up with friends for drinks and music.

The lunch scene was not idea.  Service was a little spotty - we did have to ask for things a couple of times.  But also the noise level was completely unbearable.  When my mom complained about it on her visit, I thought that was just her age talking (imagine a cranky lady shaking her fist at the kiddos - \"turn that loud mess off\").  

With the busy street on one side and live band that answered back with a higher volume, sound waves bounced chaotically off every inche of the patio - the place is nothing but hard surfaces.  I was literally screaming at my lunch companion as well as the waitress.  I was also in a volume battle with the noisy kids seated just a foot away from us.  Oh yes, there are children there too.

As I left, with a sore throat and ringing in my ears, I decided this was not a place to return.  However, when friends picked the yard later that night, I realized that wouldn't last.

And it was still loud.  But that seems more acceptable when it is after 10pm...however, I was struggling to continue to yell at my companions and listen carefully with my ear in their face to hear them.

So that was my major take away from my 6 hours at the Yard.  Loud.  In fact, I can still hear it ringing in my ears."}
{"text":"This place is what central phoenix doesn't need. Keep Fox restaurants in Scottsdale. I witnessed everything from old people sharing a beer to kids running around like maniacs, and don't get me started on the douche pistols in affliction shirts. Parking sucks. Food is subpar at best. Can't tell servers from patrons...one server came to us with her purse on. Don't need this and don't want this in such a cool mecca of independent restaurants and bars. Like I said before, take this place back to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A rather decent selection of beers, with a huge dose of attitude by the manager served.  While discussing the I'll advised USAF flight suit, called the \" fag bag\", the manager over reacted and asked us to talk appropriately. Please, we served to make this country free  don't give a damn what a consenting adult does, but are reprimanded by a bar manager on our language?  After witnessing the treatment of women, homosexuals, etc. in the middle east and then having to respond to an \"upset\" manager in a bar in Pittsburg? It's a free country, and therefore anyone is free to patron this bar, or visit a neighbor bar without the drummed up sensitivity.  P.S. Don't mention you support Trump if you want a drink, I would guess."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. 6:30pm I tell them party of 15. It is now 8:36....well you have too many people. After 5 people left they could seat us. Don't tell us 7:30pm when you can't sit anyone. The manager is an asshole also. I spoke to him 2 days before coming here and now I'm here and they kept sitting either people before us. Hister fucks here. I use to love this place. Now it's shit. Learn how to run your place instead of sitting everyone else ahead because you dont have 15 seats."}
{"text":"Cross-posting a review of a co-worker after our experience here this afternoon:

\"Just left The Yard in Market Square...went for a business lunch with three other folks and left hungry and sad.  I had to send two Mike Bison Burgers back to the kitchen because they were raw in the center (not undercooked; they weren't cooked at all).  The manager apologized,  let me know that he talked to the kitchen staff, let me know that there was a co-owner in the back (though he never came out), and gave me two appetizer gift cards.  On a positive note, the server was very good. Hopefully the co-owner had a better lunch than I did!\""}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the whole venue is really nice. Everything is new and clean with plenty of TVs for watching multiple games."}
{"text":"This is great place, has a good enviorment....I went here with some co-workers (new to the area) and had a good time. Drinks were easy to come by however it is a bit confusing the first time you visit. The Yard and Culinary Droup are two different places?, as you enter (through the back) you visit the hostess and put your name down for dinner, 90 minute wait, they text you when your table is ready. We stayed and drank, two hours went by no text....so after visiting the hostess again, they lost our place! They then got us in right away. The food was awesome although expensive and small portions (which is fine but lower the price). We had a great time while waiting....enjoying the live music and drinks. They have games but we did not participate this time. I would come back agian.."}
{"text":"I was leery prior to going, as we saw some not-great reviews here on Yelp.  We were meeting friends with our 10-month-old in tow for dinner.  Luckily, we showed up early for dinner (5:30), and our friends already had a table (I'm not sure how long it took them to get it, since they showed up earlier than us).  We sat out on the patio in the July heat, but it was actually pretty pleasant with the misters and fans.  It was comfortably busy but not crowded at 5:30 on a Saturday, with kids playing games, and a good, casual crowd having fun.  Dinner was great--sweet corn cannelloni and burger hit the spot.  Drinks impressed--I had a drink with Maker's Mark, honey, basil, and red pepper simple syrup.  I liked it so much that we recreated it at home the next night.  It got really crowded and busy later on, and by the time we left at 8 PM, it was packed.  We skipped the valet by parking in the neighborhood.  We didn't play games due to our baby getting tired, but would have loved to stay and enjoy corn hole or ping pong.  We had a great time, but I suspect if we had showed up at 7 PM on Saturday and were starving, we would have been angry and hungry by the time we got seated and got our food.  Just be smart and show up at non-peak times, and you'll love this place.  Baby was super-cranky on the way there, but was happily distracted by the fans, lights, misters, and overall fun atmosphere.  To those who posted about being annoyed by kids running around: get over it.  It's great to have a place to bring kids, let them have fun, and let mom and dad enjoy good food and cocktails.  It's part of the charm of this place.  Obviously, it's less great to have kids around once it gets more ruckus, but I was happy to see families having fun together."}
{"text":"I just left this place. It is a neat idea in concept- play area with booze and food, but omg, what a clusterfun. You really would need someone to go with you to explain how things work. This not my idea of relaxing. 

The appetizers I had were actually pretty tasty- the pretzel bread was nice. However, I got super grossed out by the hair that was in my margarita. That coupled with the whole, not having a server thing, really kills the idea of ever going back to this \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Damn fine pretzel balls here at the Yard, and damn good fried chicken too."}
{"text":"Went to the bathroom 3 times tonight and still no toilet paper in any of the women stalls."}
{"text":"Had I not followed a friend, I'd never have found this place. Door next to Nicolas coffee. Go upstairs. Like a dozen, gourmet grilled-cheese and creamy tomato bisque combos served industrial style with homemade chips. Get a side of ranch for dipping! 

Have been there once more, for happy hour, but didn't order food. Will be back."}
{"text":"The Yard looks amazing, the concept is cool... and that's about it. 

Sadly, after three visits, I've decided to take this spot out of the rotation. BUT WHY, you ask? How could I, with all the cornhole and ping pong and beer and whatnot?! Welp, I'll tell you:

The service is complete crap. 

Every. Time. We wait forever, get attitude from the staff, and have even experienced dirty glasses and cold food. Once, I ordered a \"red Stella\" (this is a simple concoction of Stella Artois and bloody mary mix.) I order it all over town and get it served up perfectly. Not only did they not know what it was here, they refused to mix it, insisting I get a shot of bloody mary mix on the side. It wouldn't mix up properly like that and my beer was warm. I complained and the server rolled her eyes at me. 

My friend got a dirty greasy glass with her Jameson and soda. 

Our overpriced fries and burgers were ice cold, IN THE SUMMER IN PHOENIX. This is no easy task, my friends. 

Finally, we waited over an hour to play cornhole. When a spot finally opened up, the dude playing before me just handed me his bean bags. I had no idea I had to actually rent them. I got yelled at by a bouncer who snatched up all the game equipment and insisted I go provide my drivers license to reserve them. I had no problem doing so, but by the time I had finished waiting to speak to someone at the register, they said the spot had already been reserved by someone else and I'd have to wait for another one to open up. 

Thanks, but no thanks. Three strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect before I got there. This place is huge and has so much room and things to do. Bags, ping pong, shuffle board and a ton of places to just sit. Plenty of bar space, dining space and activity space. The food was decent and we generally had a great time.  We did go on a Thursday afternoon but there's nothing bad I can say about it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to hang out with friends. Great beer and food and lots of stuff to do. The whole place is covered so it's even good in the summertime. Can't wait until they open a location in Gilbert."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of negative or moderate reviews, I went to the Yard prepared for a loud, crowded place with horrible service and average food. We got there at 6:00 on a Friday, which is the beginning of their dinner rush. We used their free valet parking (which we appreciated and thought was a classy move) and were seated immediately. We chose to sit indoors because there was no wait (outdoors was a half hour wait) and found the atmosphere to be fun, casual, and really \"hip\". We admired the decor, the high wood beams, and the industrial steel framing that decorated the place and would definitely give it 5 stars on decor and general vibe.
We expected the service to be not that great after reading so many reviews but the waitress was SO nice and helpful. She refilled drinks promptly, smiled a lot, and checked on us often, for me that's all that matters.
The food that we ordered was well worth it. The pretzel and cheese dip was pretty good, I probably wouldn't get it again based on the price ($10) but the French dip was to DIE for. We also ordered fish and chips which was also delicious and overall had nothing to complain about as far as the food goes. Maybe it's a bit pricey so you definitely pay for the ambiance of the place but we didn't mind.
My one and only complaint was that about 10 flies followed our food order so we were swatting them away the whole time. I've only been there once so maybe it was a fluke but that's the only thing that wasn't great about it. Trust me when I say the Yard is not nearly as crazy or loud or the service as bad as some reviewers seemed to think. Give it a shot and decide for yourself.
Overall we're definitely looking forward to going back. The food and ambiance is a much needed change from your typical chain restaurant and we absolutely loved our visit there. Afterwards we stayed and chatted a few minutes in the comfortable bench seating and just enjoyed the people watching. We didn't have time for ping pong or anything outside but it's definitely something we'll hit up next time."}
{"text":"Had a great time there with a group of  four people. It really is so flexible for all size groups. We just hung out and tossed beanbags and had a few drinks, which was nice. No pressure to have a meal, you can just stop in and play for a bit and take in the scene. 

The only thing to watch for the super drunk people who stay too long at happy hour, they can get quite annoying. Also, the parking situation is a bit hairy."}
{"text":"Awesome service (Lindsay), fantastic Bloody Mary and great roast beef grilled cheese!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.   Everyone I spoke to was unhelpful.   Specifically, I asked for help to bring my food out to me as my hands were full with my child and drinks.  I was told to wait and bring my food out myself."}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday....can't believe the bouncers at this place.   they kicked us out because my friend gave the ping pong ball to another group of people and was unable to get his license back.  During the argument George the bouncer ripped beers out of my hand and told me that \"it was his job to be aggressive\".  They really need to get over themselves.  The food was ok....certainly not worth the money charged and the lines were terrible.   This experience has soured me on this place, and all Sam Fox restaurants.  Unbelievable evening....."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and very trendy decor.  Food was average, but would come here for a drink and to socialize rather than dinner itself.  Nice to see some new restaurants coming in to downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to The Yard with my grandkids and thought that it would be fund to grab an early dinner.  Because they have outdoor games and it is pretty loud this seemed like a good idea.  I even called earlier on Friday and they said that it was very \"kid friendly\" but that it closed down the game area to adults after 8pm which made sense to me.  When we arrived they told us that the game area shut down at 6pm on Friday and Saturdays.  We had a large group and a number of kids in the group so we decided to Aunt Chilada's.  Lots of places to eat in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We had terrible service and I'm sad that we went. It was a busy Saturday but even the few bartenders weren't friendly or helpful. Had to ask twice for drinks and everything else. I won't be going back by choice."}
{"text":"Three stars basically for an awesome concept and layout.  First off the parking situation is horrendous and then the looooooong wait when there were empty tables everywhere and no one else waiting. I mean like 30 minutes of a wait on a tuesday at 4pm with half the restaurant empty, it was just me the wife and baby. Anyways we had a very nice server but she didnt really know anything about the beers. the food tasted fresh, I had the italian sandwich. My wife had some pretzels and fondue which I thought was a cool presentation. My brother and his girlfriend met up with us and they tried some different appetizers that they said were alright. Basically this is a cool hangout if you want to do some boozing activities not really a dinner spot."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been here for happy hour and had great food, service, and drinks.  The outdoor playground area for adults is awesome.  I have had lunch with family and clients and great experiences each time.  The M.A.C. burger is so freaking good that it makes my spirits rise after eating it.  Not much to say negative here except the servers all dress in there own casual attire so it is hard to determine who is working there and who is not."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at The Yard last night for a small birthday party.  The experience was so good that I wanted to let management know about two of their servers who are outstanding!  We started on the patio with Haley, she set the tone for the night by being extremely friendly, helpful and efficient!  We were having a great time but wanted to move inside. Haley was so gracious about that and set us up with another wonderful server named Sally.  These two deserve to be recognized for their over the top service.  They made us feel like the only people in the place when in fact it was quite busy.  Kudos to Haley and Sally at The Yard!"}
{"text":"FINALLY got to actually go inside this place!! Would always drive by and see the lights and the crowd and hear the music and just think, I need to get in there. Just came back from it and honestly, you aren't missing much. We were quick to be seated, but the music is so loud, you have to yell in the other persons ear, even if they are sitting RIGHT next to you for them to hear you-not a great place for a date. The food, meh, wasn't that great really. Parking, yes was terrible but i was determined to get in. Thought it'd be worth it and sadly was wrong. The food is average, and there is very little on the actual menu. Like, almost nothing? I even asked for the second menu because it's that small! haha wasn't great. Create a dream of how you'd like this place to be, and hold onto that rather than going inside, you will only be disappointed."}
{"text":"Music very loud.  Waitress brought wrong drinks.  Didn't bring the appetizer we ordered at all. And brought one wrong entree.  Hate to write bad reviews but don't waste your time.  She didn't even notice that all these things were wrong... Super awkward didn't want spit in our food so just took what she brought."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and the bartenders had knowledge about everything I asked about, and made recommendations.  Happy hour, dollar off drafts, two bucks off apps (5-7 pm)- we did the poutine with the short ribs, and would do it again. I saw the mac-attack sandwich, and that looked amazing- I will get that next time."}
{"text":"overpriced and pretentious. They force you to valet, and say it's complimentary but of course the sign says gratuity not included. You should not expect everyone to be willing to vallet and have cash to tip. This is not the kind of restaurant that even warrants fancy service like that. The food is okay but overpriced."}
{"text":"Sam Fox has a winner at their newest location.  Possibly their best in Phoenix.  Great job in converting/re-purposing an existing building by turning a motorcycle dealership into a destination.  

They took the existing Culinary Dropout menu from the Scottsdale location and made  a few new additions.  How can you not love a place that has both meatloaf and fried chicken on the menu to satisfy your need for comfort food. They have 18 beers on tap and at least that many additional available in cans, we're not talking about just Bud and Coors Light, lots of great craft brew choices.  In addition, they have an amazing selection of specialty cocktails and a nice wine list. 

Solid food and beverage choices are needed, but a great staff is always a key to a great experience and The Yard does not disappoint.  Everyone was great and made my visit memorable.  

What makes The Yard stand out may be the space.  Plenty of room for indoor and outdoor dining.  The two sided bar services both the indoor dining area and the covered outdoor area.  I call it an area but it is really a multi-purpose space.  There is bar space, dining tables, sofas & high back chairs (not patio furniture) with fire pits, and a huge game area that includes bag toss, ping pong and foosball.  You also get to park your bicycle \"inside\" at the far end of the space.   

Overall just a great place to drink, eat, hang out, and play."}
{"text":"This is the type of place we need more of! I've been no less than 5 or 6 times (Sunday afternoon with friends, Dad's bday dinner, my birthday, etc) I love that there's something for everyone and the have a great mix of people. I love that they have Vinyl Station playing on Saturdays just beware that the 8pm show is usually very busy. 

The pros: The pretzel fondue is a must. The outdoor space is great and there's fun backyard style games if you like that sort of thing. The food is overall very good and I've tried most of the items on the menu. I've had both good and bad service but the past few times I've been the service has been good. The atmosphere is fun and the outdoor space is my great. They have a rotating beer list.

The cons: Sometimes they have a long wait but they usually over quote. Parking can be a pain when valet is full. They don't accept reservations for groups unless your 8+ and they usually are fully committed if you call the day of. I had an issue with the hostess but our server and manager did a great job to resolve the situation when we were there 7/19.

Overall I would recommend this place to everyone just be aware that this place is popular and it's busy. Try to go on the off hours if you want to avoid the crowds. Great job Fox Restaurants!"}
{"text":"Have been with a large group and a small group as well. The food and drink selection was great. I have never seen such a list for grilled cheese sandwiches!!  The best app that we tried were the mac&cheese balls. A must for all who visit. The bartender was great at providing his suggestions for flights, but he did get me with a 13.5% bourbon stout that was good but not expected."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the meatball appetizer and fish and chips. So good! Had a bite of the ribs- also incredible. The service was excellent! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better atmosphere - the pictures do not do this place justice. We ordered dessert and somehow it got overlooked, so the Manager brought us every dessert on the menu and didn't charge us for one. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved the concept, the company, the architecture, the setting, the furniture, the design. Not enough to satisfy me and to encourage me to go back. Service was not bad, not good either. Food was average, I guess the Chef is actually a culinary school dropout. But it seems to work. OK. The 3rd star is for the bathrooms, I though they were pretty cool actually."}
{"text":"Great big place. I'm visiting for the week and some friends brought me here.  It's a great place for all. Upon entering there was a live bad playing. Then there is a large indoor restaurant which I didn't get to experience. We opted to head outside. Very unique establishment. There's an inside/outside bar, then plenty of seating for food or drinks, then there's corn hole, ping pong, shuffle board and giant jenga games to play. It's a great atmosphere. The food was good. The beer menu was above average, and prices were just what you would expect at any bar. The staff all seemed to be great from what the ones we encountered. My only gripe is that on a SATURDAY night, they close at midnight. Very strange and disappointing. 

Over all it seems like a great place to host your birthday party or go out with a fun group."}
{"text":"Not. Good. The service was inadequate at best and offensively patronizing at worst. Not only did the bartender not know his product, his entire demeanor was condescending and dismissive. We asked how the pilsner was, and being in the industry expected a professional opinion. Instead we were told 'we'll, it's a pilsner, it's just like coors light'. We ignored the bad opinions and reviews of the place, hoping to find something different and the decor was wonderful. It's a great space ruined by poor staff and bad attitude."}
{"text":"Cool place, great atmosphere. Great food and drink menu. Outdoor yard games, ping pong, all under one roof"}
{"text":"Love!!! Great ambiance. Awesome crowd. Service is so so. Don't expect to get served quickly but the games, food, and drinks are excellent. Overall a killer place for fun or dates."}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor game set up! Went for brunch on a Sunday And enjoyed the vibe. Staff was on top of it! In love with the bacon Bloody Mary!!! Good job"}
{"text":"YARDWORK -- Culinary Dropout is Too Cool For School.

Sam Fox is crazy. Crazy like a--well-- \"fox.\" With Fox Concepts restaurants dotting the culinary landscape, you can't go far without finding one of his kitchens' cooking. Zinburger, NoRTH Italian Farmhouse, Sauce, True Food Kitchen, Olive & Ivy, Arrogant Butcher, Modern Steak, Wildflower and Blanco Tacos + Tequila. They're sprouting up like portobello mushrooms.

His latest \"gastropub,\" Culinary Dropout, not only has a location in chi-chi Scottsdale (natch!) but one in viva Las Vegas, inside the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. The latest Dropout is part of a burgeoning campus called, \"The Yard.\"

After pouring $8 million dollars into the gigantic 53,000 square foot facility, another Dropout debuted. Culinary Dropout has a pleasing, tasty (if largely unadventurous) menu. Think \"comfort food\" with a little twist. With an uncomfortable price tag. An attractive antipasti menu featuring meats, veggies and cheeses kick off the event with prices from $2 for bread & olive oil and (yikes!) $13 for Iberian Ham, a Spanish delicacy.

Shared plates include brats or black mussels ($12) and their fabulous Soft Pretzels & Cheese Fondue for $10. Seven different sandwiches can be yours. Turkey Pastrami is served on a pretzel roll with Swiss cheese and coleslaw for a pricey $13. Nice. But not necessarily a bargain. A French Dip with shaved prime rib, fontina and au jus is a wallet-busting $17.

Six different salads are featured; the Winter Salad ($12) with sweet potato, apples, farro, pomegranate, black kale walnuts and goat cheese is something you'll find yourself craving.

The 11 entrées prove to be a hard choice; prices range from $13 for Meatloaf served with familiar friends, mash potatoes, gravy and green beans. The highly touted Fried Chicken gives you a rather puny breast, leg and thigh for $16. Ours was served room temperature along with the mashed potatoes and a biscuit. If it was hot, it would've been heavenly--but still expensive. I wish I knew the secret to the breading, however.

Cast your line for the delish Rainbow Trout, de-boned, beautifully filleted, prepared with plenty of butter and daintily topped with French green beans, a few caramelized shallots and toasted almonds. A nicely sized fish, but it looked a little lonely on an even bigger platter. A spoonful of Rice Pilaf or a polenta would helped justify the whopping $19 they reel out of your wallet.

Try out a few nibbles available at Happy Hour for a fraction of the price on Monday-Friday, 3-6 p.m. A tempting Brunch Menu is available Saturdays & Sundays, 9 a.m.-3 p.m.

The Yard will also house Little Cleo's Seafood Legend, which opened March 20. 

One draw for The Yard will be the never-ending patio, stretching as far as the eye can see. McDonald's has a PlayHouse with a Jump- Jump and slides for AD/HD brats. Dropout has the same thing--except for hipsters. Ping- pong tables, cornhole, bocce and tetherball will keep you occupied while you wait. And wait. And wait for a table. On busy nights you can expect a 2-hour wait. At least. Parking is a challenge, but valet is free.

The Yard is still worth a look/see. But watch out: look at your wallet. See it disappear."}
{"text":"Had the Yard Burger and one of the draught specials. Burger came with fries.
Burger was great, fries were soggy. Very good service, but the restaurant was very loud that I could barely hear the server or my friend."}
{"text":"I'm from California, but was in Pittsburgh for a Steeler Game. The Yard was the 2nd restaurant we ate at and I'd have to say the food was pretty good. It was very lively since it was football weekend, but maybe it's always like this on the weekends. I had the wings and those were pretty flavorful. My friend had a crab sandwich with onion rings that was off the hook. The set up of the restaurant was not what I'm use to, but that's okay. The customer service was okay. Our waiter wasn't super friendly. He seemed to be in a rush and should've remained attentive to all his customers regardless of the busy-ness. I'd eat there again while visiting."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour. Wine comes in stemless glasses the size of a small juice glass. We ordered pulled pork nachos which were made with cheese sauce and fatty meat. Gave them another chance at lunch. Ordered a side caeser salad. Very small and half the lettuce was brown. They did bring a larger salad when it was brought to their attention. Funny though, this salad had all fresh romaine. Server said we could sub chips for fruit and then up charged us when bill arrived. The fruit was previously frozen. To his benefit he removed the upcharged fruit. I hope they they succeed but I will not he going back."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a group or if you like to drink and be social and active. Good food, fun atmosphere and drink prices worthy of New York City! Absolute worst drink pricing in Phoenix. Come on guys. My advice, head to Lola's to save yourself a breathtaking bar tab."}
{"text":"So I'm still on my quest for better grilled cheese in Pittsburgh. I had the wang chung-shredded chicken, gouda, slaw. It was just ok. There were chunks of chicken, a small amount of shredded gouda and a lot of slaw which just made it soggy. The sandwich didn't really hold together well and fell apart. The best part was the tomato soup ,which is a bit thicker but still tasty. I opted for the sweet potato fries which were extremely soggy and way too salty. The restaurant is loud-so just be aware of that if you're looking for a semi-quiet place for lunch-this is not it. They do have a decent beer selection which may be their saving grace-however I'm sure this location will always be packed due to being in Market Square. I will continue my search for better grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"BOOM! WITH A CAPITAL BOOM! ERICA WAS THE BEST, very helpful with the menu. My drink never ran out. Best food beat staff good times!"}
{"text":"Will is awesome. Go to manager. :) a true example of customer service. Mr Fox Concepts would be proud :)"}
{"text":"Food was comparable the camelback location. Ping pong tables and patio was great. However,  the camelback crew needs to come down and train the waiters on providing service."}
{"text":"I LOVE grilled cheese sandwiches, in fact, during my entire pregnancy I craved grilled cheese sandwiches and I made my husband go here often!  Our most recent visit was to market square over the weekend, and it didn't disappoint.  One of my favorites is the big che-bowski, which is what I got.  It is served on texas toast with gouda cheese, bacon, fried egg and tomato.  The fried egg really makes the grilled cheese,as soon as you bite into it, or cut it in half as I do, the yolk  breaks and makes for a great dip and just adds another dimension to the sandwich.  I've also had the poppin my collar, and that is equally as good.  I actually turned my husband onto poppin my collar, which is what he got.  If you like a little spice, this is perfect.  I know, shrimp on a grilled cheese sounds odd, but I assure you, this will not disappoint!  After looking at the appetizers, we finally decided on the yard poutine, the pub pretzels and mac attack were our other choices, which are both very good.  It was delicious, a bit messy, so eat with a fork.  They give you a nice portion and it's big enough to share with 2-4 people.  The servers are all very nice and friendly, they don't hover over you like some places, but they make sure that you are taken care of.  I would highly recommend The Yard Market Square if you're in the mood for a good grilled cheese and a good beer!"}
{"text":"I went to The Yard today for the first time ever. I think we went around a good time of day (3pm) because there were only a few guests which was really nice! Our waitress Hunter was so bubbly and sweet, and they had our food out to us in literally 10 minutes!

I had the Smack Yo Mama grilled cheese, the pulled chicken on it had so much flavor! And the sweet potato waffle fries with cinnamon butter were nice and light and a nice contrast to my savory sandwich. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and \"farmhouse meets hipster\". The food is good but it is hard for me to order due to my dietary restrictions and allergies. I unfortunately had to order a hamburger patty for lunch as all the other menu items had some interaction with dairy or garlic. 

Nonetheless, everyone else was able to be more adventurous and have delicious experiences."}
{"text":"Nice service, nice atmosphere. Salad was a little high priced and the dressing tasted like it was high in sugar content. Then again, I don't like any sugar at all in my salad dressing. Suggestion would be to offer dry salads with a side of any dressing and to be sure to carry extra virgin olive oil and apple cider vinegar. Then I think the salad would be worth the price. The restaurant has potential to be different than surrounding restaurants who offer the same sweet salad dressing.  Overall, it was a nice place."}
{"text":"Gentlemen: unless you are very confident, wait until the second set of bathroom doors before you whip it out. 

Otherwise, food/drinks/atmosphere are excellent."}
{"text":"Wow what a let down, concept so great service terrible! Food way over priced for your basic sandwiches and small plates. Went for my 30th birthday hoping to enjoy a new local joint, rudest staff in the valley. When I called in to make reservation I was told it's first come service in the Yard area, arrived at 6 on a Friday and was told I should have made reservation! Wound up waiting for an hour for a table and when my party size grew I was shunned by the manager and had to send friends away!!!!! Awful way to spend my birthday. Do yourself a favor skip this place just full of rude staff and hipsters not to mention the parking nightmares and $$$$$ went to a dive bar across the street and had a better time."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place and I plan on coming here frequently!  In fairness, I came on a Monday night, so I still can't say whether the crowd would be too overwhelming or what the service would be like when busy.  I love the menu options (I like to eat the variety of steamed/grilled veggies with some meats and cheeses - perfect!); drinks were good. The service was somewhat slow, but not like I expected after reading reviews.  The staff was very friendly, however, they will NOT make eye contact unless they are going to serve you.  I think that is their way of avoiding having to deal with you until they're ready.  It would come off as far greater service if they simply looked at you, smiled, and held up a finger in a gesture of \"1 minute\", or actually said \"I'll be right with you shortly\".  That's all it would have taken to make this experience better.  Very cool vibe, good music, cool people, and the games are awesome!  A great concept!"}
{"text":"First time yesterday, won't be the last.  I read a number of the reviews and they were 110% accurate.  Great sandwich, soup, chips and they even had fresh brewed unsweetened iced tea in mason jars!  How can you go wrong?  Our server was fantastic!   She never let our drinks get half empty.  Very friendly and quick with any additional requests.  This place is a gem.  BTW...I had the \"smack yo.......\" grilled cheese and it was a belly filler *****!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, stiff drinks and the Kale Salad is very tasty. Go here for the ambiance"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Except the ID guy needs to learns manners and/or customer service skills."}
{"text":"We love coming here. The combination of two worlds is awesome. The place is fantastic. The service is pretty good. But the food is amazing. We just love coming here."}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy some beer and drinks. Watch the NFL playoff game there. Being from out of town the staff was extremely helpful and polite. They answered many questions I had about the area and once they discovered we were from out of town made it obvious that they wanted to make sure we had a great experience which we did! Would recommend this to any one of my friends visiting the Pittsburgh area. They even had some local Michigan beers on tap!"}
{"text":"The Yard has improved quite a bit. Typically after having oysters at Little Cleo's, I leave. This time was different:

-they got the ping pong table thing under control. The last few times, we dealt with jerks lying about the rules on how to get a table. 

-service is WAY more timely, and kinder. 

Probably the most impressive part was that it was 114 degrees and the misters made it surprisingly comfortable for an Arizona evening. 

Only downside was my mule was too dang sweet. For $10 it tasted like syrup and house vodka, I'd expect better. It does come in a copper mug, as the menu notes \"someone stole ours\" or something. Besides Handlebar in Tempe, everyone else seems to carry them, so... Your play, Yard."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. EVER. I am a giant fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts and the first time I went to The Yard - I was so excited. Conceptually, the design is stellar. However, I will not be returning. I called to set a reservation of 12 for my birthday this past Saturday. I was told they did not take reservations. Turns out, they do. I have had several friends that have been told they do not take reservations and another set of friends that say that they have actually made reservations. I found out upon my arrival, they do indeed take reservations. They need to get their story straight.

Anyway, we show up at 3:15pm and put our name on a list for 12. We were told 1 hour to 1.5 hour wait. No problem, we went to the bar. While at the bar, the staff was literally fumbling over one another and it was not even that busy. The entire bar (people we did not even know) were all complaining about the time it took to order one drink due to the lack of attention from the bar staff. 

At 4:30, I go to check in with the hostesses. They had sat a different group at our table and said they would try to find us a new table. This was a result of their miscommunication as a staff. They were not able to clear a table for us right away to rectify their own mistake, so they sat us in a lounge area about 10 minutes later until they could find us a table. However, we would have to vacate the lounge area by 6pm because -wait for it - someone had a reservation for the lounge area at 6. My only prayer was that we certainly wouldn't still be waiting for a table at 6pm (nearly 3 hours later!). 

The waitress for our lounge area was so incredibly rude that I cannot put it into words. I have never had that poor of an attitude from a staff member at any restaurant, especially Fox. After the biggest let down of giving our table away, I was hoping perhaps they would offer to buy us a pitcher of beer or some appetizers. We received one bowl of chips and one fondue dish...for the entire group. We had to wait over 15 minutes for one round of drinks (that we were charged full price for). It was not until the time was nearing 5:30pm that the manager seemed to get proactive about finding us a table. Fast forward to 5:45pm (2.5 hours after arriving) and there is no table that even seems to be in sight for us to be seated at and we are still receiving horrendous service. We decide to go down the street to Zipps where they could seat us immediately. Can you imagine how hungry we are? Arriving at 3:15pm ready to eat?

The manager noticed we were leaving and came over to try and get us to stay. I had been so incredibly respectful, nice and understanding throughout the entire process until I hit my breaking point as we were leaving. I explained that people literally spent money to fly in for this birthday because it was a very special birthday and we chose The Yard for a reason! However, the experience at the Yard ruined my birthday. Upon unloading on the manager, they took care of ONE of my $7 drinks (woohoo?) and he sent me on my way with a free brownie. 

It truly seems as if they only hired for looks at this restaurant because everyone that we encountered may have been good looking, but seemingly had never worked in the restaurant/hospitality/service industry. I have never been so disappointed in a dining experience. The manager asked for my email address so that they could invite us back and give us a special experience. It took him four days to send that follow up email (I received it this morning...prompting this review). Any professional would have sent a sincere apology within 24 hours, which is typical business practice. 

Is there a chance that my group was the exception to the rule? Possibly. However, I am not willing to return and find out. In fact, I will not be returning to any Fox concept for quite a while. Disappointment does not begin to describe my experience at The Yard. Possible patrons beware!"}
{"text":"I was encouraged by friends to try this place again, so went twice before updating my review....the staff is much friendlier and more attentive, the service was very good. Just had drinks, once at a table top and another time say at the bar. Both times had a great experience and will visit again! Hopefully, will try the food again soon."}
{"text":"++Sunday brunch(Saturday)
+++ Endless mimosa

Chicken and waffles?  Yep!

Staff - on point.  

Coming again?  No brainer."}
{"text":"Will, while I appreciate your response (except you didn't give me a way to private message you), it makes me wonder why this offer wasn't made when I was struggling to make arrangements for our last visit.  I called the Yard 3-4 times last week, and the only response I received was \"sorry, there's nothing we can do.\"  Why didn't anyone offer to connect me to the special events manager?  Did the staff not know this was an option?"}
{"text":"Friday happy hour should not be dominated by kids. Happy hour seating had a 45 minute wait. Regular seating was immediate. What's the difference? Happy hour prices only apply to happy hour seating. They should just be upfront about your choice. Pay full price and sit with kids, or stand with adults and get happy hour pricing.

Good food, good service from Casey and Nate, and nicely measured drinks save a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Food is great, I love the place for that alone. Went in for bottomless mimosas once, and maybe the batch was just light but I wouldn't recommend it. It was really just orange juice. I couldn't taste the champagne, and definitely couldn't feel it after several glasses (trying to get my $$ worth of that bottomless deal)."}
{"text":"Brought Company here for Christmas Dinner - Lively loud environment - Lots going on - We sat outside in bank of middle tables it was a cold night - No heaters in middle tables all along side tables -  Jokingly commented that they needed a heater in the middle  - response was oh there was one but we moved it over to that table (which was already under two heaters on the side with permanent heaters  apparently they had been sitting at out table and moved and took the heater with them)

Arrived Early for a reservation - Plenty of open tables yet they still seated us after our reservation time 

Food was OK - Arrived Cold - At one point one of my staff  and myself asked for some additional sauce for our steak - Never arrived until we asked for a take home box and asked for some to take home.

Two of my staff have specific diet needs - Server could not answer questions of what was on salads or in dressing - was unable to accommodate their needs (which is not too picky)

Been to other culinary Dropout locations those were OK - Unless you just really want the Outdoor bar and play yard - Noting too impressive"}
{"text":"Honest review here.

Service was mixed, you had your average burned out workers with a few who genuinely cared about your experience there, upon entering the place was nearly empty me and my date asked for the best seat and instead the lady at the front who looked like she was sincerely pissed about a personal problem asked how we were doing and everything but seats us at an awful table that made no sense for two people so we immediately moved to a nicer booth. I could tell who the manager was and we saw he helped around the restaurant but something seemed off about him, still a positive regardless.

The menu was just impressively bad altogether and confusing, is there not enough cooking shows and advice online to fix these things?

The atmosphere is hardcore carrying this place, if the weather is nice which it was, sitting in the outside area was good on top of the the access to games afterwards in which our entire positive experience was playing ping pong haha.

The speed of the food was good but that was the downfall as well, every single piece of the food for both our entrees was bad to mediocre, like store bought food for 5x cheaper tastes better through a microwave, I'm not kidding, the mussels tasted rubbery, barely any sausage, sauce was basically water, there was no sides unless you specifically paid and asked for some and my dates fish was decent but only because it was a fried piece that you can take out of a package and can't mess up. The bread I got was burnt like a little kid made it and was so hard and inedible I basically grimaced and cut my mouth trying to chew it. So overall the inflated prices for food that I could just microcrave and do 3x better with just adding basic spices just made the eating experience awful for this particular time that I came here.

This isn't even some paid competitor type review either I just genuinely hate overpaying and wasting time for an experience like this.

Edit: I was right about who the manager was, was contacted personally and the issues I had personally have been addressed to hopefully prevent them from happening in the future. I'm definitely not a mean spirited person and can recognize that everyone has a bad or an off day but I only leave these reviews if there is a combination of things that is just enough to tip me off to leaving a review. I would have waited an extra 20-30 minutes for food that was properly prepared rather then rushed out, that's just the way it is. Sorry Henry, we still left a tip anyways though."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS! Who knew grilled cheese could be so appealing? At the Yard - they made me a believer! I never order a cheese sandwich when I dine out.  The difference is the variation of grilled cheese sandwiches available for dining! My sandwich had pepper jack,cheese, jalapeños, grilled chicken - perfect! Then the tomatoes soup was great - on a cold day (what the doctor ordered). I opted for fries instead of potato chips which was good! All in all, a great meal for the price! The combo of all 3 items is such a winner! I have to add / I don't like tomato soup - until I tried it at the Yard! Thanks for the wonderful meal during the dangerously low temperatures in Pittsburgh! Will definitely visit again to try a different grilled cheese combo!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing, even the Manger Jess she went above and beyond to make sure my cousin and I were happy. I'm coming back many times during the week: they truly understand custom service and how to treat people!! Their food is great and beer selection is amazing!! Why else go to another bar?! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Please, please do not park in front of the neighborhood houses.  It is getting really old and annoying asking, more often than not drunk, Yard patrons to use the valet parking instead of parking in front of our homes.  They provide free valet parking, use it!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time at the yard! Great food, good service. 
Last night, it was a little after closing, and my date and I needed a cab, but both our phones were dead. Juan noticed we looked a bit stranded, and offered to call a cab. He was so kind and willing to take care of his customers. Thanks Juan! Just another reason to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time, I've had cold fries, and a grilled cheese that looked like it had oily cheap cheese from a packet.   Grilled cheeses never really look like they touch a griddle for more than a few seconds.   Service is always good!  I'll definitely go back but may order my grilled cheese a little toastier!"}
{"text":"Great beer bar off Market Square.  Bartenders were chatty and knowledgable and generous with tasters.  My pulled pork sliders were outstanding with toasted buns and hot sauce at the bar.  Comfy seats and a good crowd for people watching.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled cheese here with \"two beef patties\" on it.  The bartender told me it was \"like a burger.\"  When I got the thing and opened it up, there were two small patties of beef roughly the size of silver dollars in one corner of the bun.  When I showed the rest of my group, we were laughing so hard that we practically made a spectacle of ourselves.  I actually started looking around for the hidden camera because I thought I was being pranked.  11 or 12 bucks for two pieces of toast, a slice of cheese and two comically small beef patties is a joke.

I will say that the bar is quite nice and the bartenders were very attentive and friendly.  This is an ok place to go and have a few drinks.  Don't blow 12 bones down the toilet on the food, though.  The prices are a joke for what you get."}
{"text":"I went to the Yard on 7th street last night to play games, enjoy the music and eat (what a cool spot!). At one point, I sat at the bar, ordered food, and after the bartender said it would take seven minutes, I leisurely used the restroom and came back to see two girls had taken my spot (they either didn't see or didn't care that my silverware, full drink, etc. was there), so I sat next to a couple who seemed to know everyone there. Two other girls soon sat on the other side of me (I casually said hi and got no response), who also seemed to know everyone there. So here I was pinned between these two popular couples and several employees would frequent stop by, chat and take care of these couples every need, all of which I had no problem with. But I did have a problem with them not helping me (I didn't need the flair they got but the basics would have been nice). After my meal, I told my waiter I was done and thought I'd get the check but it never came. So I sat there like a douche for about fifteen minutes after my meal (my friends had already left). I didn't know the exact price of my meal, so I just locked eyes with another employee to see that I was shoving some cash under my silverware, told the hostess on the way out what I did and left. What would you have done?"}
{"text":"So my wife and friends came before a show and had an amazing experience great service great food great beer.came after the show....totally different.  after repeatedly being told the kitchen closes at 10 when it was 9:10 further annoying me it took 14 mins to get 4 beers as our server seemed confused and the bartender stared at Sunday night football with our ticket hanging there. my recommendation...come before 8 for great food and service after that go somewhere else"}
{"text":"this place has it all. delicious food, creative and tasty cocktails, and games (ping pong and cornhole)! parking is terrible. and given its immense popularity, it can be challenging to get in for a game or find a seat...but if you can manage it, the yard does not disappoint."}
{"text":"It made a lot of sense that this place only has 3 stars even though it's pretty popular. Here right now with a very large party. They definitely had a table that we requested that would comfortably accommodate all of us. However, that request was blatantly ignored. Once we took it upon ourselves, we were scolded by our waiter? Now, I really want you to keep in mind I am completely sober due to a medication I'm taking. If it weren't for a dear friends birthday, I would not step foot in this place. The food is actually pretty good and they have some interesting drinks. The portions are very small and overpriced. Now, because of the inconsiderate staff, some of our more emotional party members are getting their feelings hurt by half the party having to sit elsewhere. Culinary dropout, I am disappointed in you just like your teachers and parents were. Grow up already."}
{"text":"I recently ate here with my husband and some friends before a symphony concert. It was my first time at this restaurant, but, definitely not my last! It was delicious! The menu has lots to choose from, including a ton of variations on grilled cheese but also excellent drinks and appetizers.  

We arrived around 5:45pm for a our reservation.  We were greeted promptly and seated while we waited for our friends to arrive.  We ordered drinks and looked over the menu.  We also put in our appetizer order of poutine.  Our waiter was wonderful. He gave great recommendations and answered questions about the menu.  He checked back in with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  Also, as someone with food allergies, they were fantastic about making sure that I had what I needed and knew exactly what was in each dish to make sure I wouldn't get sick.

It was a fun experience with great food! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hours are wrong - they open at 4pm on weekdays. 

I sat at the bar since I was just a party of one that day. The bartender was friendly and prompt with welcoming me; he also helped my choice in picking out my meal. 
I tried the BBQ chicken grilled cheese and the sweet potato fries, with the side of tomato soup. Tomato soup tastes just like tomato soup, but could've been warmer when served. The sweet potato fries would've been better without the extra salt/seasoning served on them - the cinnamon butter complimented them enough. The BBQ chicken grilled cheese sandwich was yummy and had a good mix of flavor. I thought the $11 price might've been a bit steep but at least there was a good amount of chicken. 
However the low star rating is due to the lack of communication. I saw a poster about trivia. The start time was wrong (not a big deal); but then when I show up with my team, we are told there is no room because all tables were reserved. No heads up on needing reservations. 
So while I might check it out in the future, I won't go out of my way or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to culinary dropout before and enjoyed the food very much. However, when I went recently it was the worst experience I had ever had at a restaurant. The manager refused to serve my friend with a legal ID just because it was vertical. He was illogical, unhelpful, and honestly just plain rude. I will not be returning and I do not recommend that you go if you are looking to be treated respectfully."}
{"text":"35 minute wait before 5 pm for overpriced mediocre food in a building that has multiple stairwells closed and a semi functional elevator. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner several times now with my girlfriend and we've enjoyed ourselves each time.

Over the course of several different visits I've had several different grilled cheeses, fry flavors, a burger, and a flatbread.  Everything I've eaten has been tasty with a special emphasis on the fries and the tomato soup.  The sweet potato fries and cajun fries are great, and even though I usually don't like tomato soup I really enjoy it as a side with the grilled cheeses.

My only complaint is that loud bar music bleeds over into the rest of the restaurant, making it hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Tasty burger in a cool atmosphere especially if you're in a large group. They have lots of comfortable patio furniture with plenty of flat screens. Also, if you're competitive, you can play cornhole, ping pong, or bocce. Either go during happy hour or bring your sugar mama/daddy cause 2 domestics and the burger set me back 25 buckaroos."}
{"text":"So Much Fun!!!!!!! It was very busy, I went on a holiday weekend, but they managed the crowd well. Drinks were pretty fast, server was around when we needed her and I absolutely loved those pretzels & cheese dip!!!!! 

The washroom is a little odd (co-ed, but clean :-)! 

Thankful for their valet! 

Overall great time, I won corn hole and had great food & great drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Amazing staff, awesome beer and killer food! If you are in market square this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here during a football Sunday. Enjoyed the bar area and some time with corn hole. Order the burger at the bar it was good. Too bad some of the other restaurants were closed. It has a good vibe. I'll be coming back to try the other restaurants."}
{"text":"First time eating and the the food was really good.  Messy, but good. Had the \"Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer\" with tater tots w/Old Bay and tomato soup.  .  If you like Buffalo Chicken Dip, this is the winner. They also had good service.

As a side note, they use \"Open Table\" Wich could be handy on a busy night."}
{"text":"We went to The Yard for the first time last weekend.  The overall experience was just ok.  I will start with the positive.  Great patio and nice selection of mixed drinks.  The homemade chips were awesome, the mussels not so much. Decent service.  The not so positive. Even though all prices were clearly marked, still was a shock when we received the bill. Expensive. Flies everywhere, although not their fault. White napkin fuzz left all over my black shirt.  When you pay $10.00 a drink you would think the napkin quality could be improved or black napkins made available.  I know this seems like a dumb thing to take issue with, but at this price point it should be addressed."}
{"text":"Kammi (sp?) is our server tonight for a group of 8. She has been so accommodating and friendly since we walked in the door. Never leaves our drinks empty and always makes sure to check up on us to see if we need anything without being overbearing.

The next time we come here we will be sure to request her! Great service"}
{"text":"Very fun place to hang out.  Lots of backyard games to play.  Very cool for a date night."}
{"text":"I went with my family for lunch. There was a bachelor party that was taking shots off stools that they moved in the middle of the room around other customers. Our waitress was terrible, I don't know if she was more worried about the party or was clueless. The food took forever and was not worth the wait or price. I called the manager that night with my concerns, who said she would send a gift card to try it again, and of course it never came. Don't waste your time or money, totally not worth it. There are 1000 other restaurants downtown, this place is not worth anyone's time."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved The Yard at the Galleria! My mom and I were trying to book a place last minute for a graduation party and The Yard was BEYOND accommodating. We were able to book their private room that comfortably held 20 people. Damon was an amazing waiter and made sure our bottomless mimosas were truly bottomless. Michael was also extremely attentive. 10/10 would recommend for a bottomless brunch in Pittsburgh and/or a private event!"}
{"text":"The best thing I can say was that the food was good.  Then it went down hill from there.  The hostess scowled at us when we asked for a booth.  The waitress never smiled.  When the food arrived (there were three of us there) all we could do was gasp and laugh at the puny portions.  Then when the bill arrived - we were still hungry and it was $60 for lunch.  On the upside the manager was called over and they brought out some extra food to 'make up' for the small portions at no charge.  That would have put our lunch total to $90 for the three of us.   Eek! Me thinks not.  I will never go back there.  Oh yea we arrived at 11 am on Monday and got the last parking place.  For me the Yard is totally ridiculous."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to come grab food and drinks at either Culinary Dropout or Barrio Queen and play some outdoor games. Ping pong or corn hole anyone? 

The patios at both restaurants are massive and offer an inviting space to lounge with friends in between your epic ping pong battles. Would highly recommend for a Sunday fun day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are great fans of Culinary Dropout. There's one right by our house, but we heard about The Yard and about a great area of games and such. We took our three kids there and moved our table three times to be close to the gaming area so they could play. Each time, the hostess seemed confused and we felt we were being reprimanded for our move. There was no one there. We thought for sure this is our place for the summer, even though it's a bit warm. My children were not misbehaving, just playing ping pong as we supervised. The manager came over twice and told them they were not allowed to be in the area, which is the very reason we were there. I understand about children misbehaving and running wild with other adults present, but this was not the case at all. We were excited about a nice afternoon, but once we were told the children could not even play a game of ping pong, we left immediately. We will not return there. If you have children, you shouldn't go either."}
{"text":"Fun...great service and great food...One of Phoenix's most unique and fun dining destinations."}
{"text":"We had a great time here! The staff was so friendly, the place was clean, and the food was great. They had a great selection of drafts and their grilled cheeses are unique and delicious. This place is also known for their ridiculously good deals. Their flatbreads were half off and we shared the imperial swine which tasted so good. Their grilled cheeses come with a tomato soup which we were not a fan of but who gets a grilled cheese with pierogies or Mac n cheese on it looking to be impressed by the tomato soup? The pierogies 'n at grilled cheese was so delicious and so filling I can't imagine not splitting this sandwich. This place has great ambiance, staff, and food and if we lived in Pittsburgh we definitely would plan on coming back."}
{"text":"It was genuinely hard to choose, everything sounded so delicious, and it was. Great craft beer selection, as well. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Hard to believe that 3 grilled cheese sandwiches, four beers, one appetizer and an order of lettuce wraps cost 93 dollars with tip. In addition,the service was extremely slow and the food quality was fair. Ordered a Sam Adams on nitro to be told ten minutes later they were out of it. My yard of beer, listed at  ten bucks was listed on the check for 11.  When questioned why this was, I was told the glasses were changed from 32 to 34 ounces but the charge would be reduced to the menu price. I was then asked to hand the waiter the menu so adjustments could be made. How many customers were charged an extra buck without their knowledge? Appetizer of fried Mac n cheese balls took thirty minutes from order to table!  Restaurant not overly busy at 2pm so what was the deal? Disappointed to say the least. Ten dollars to park made it even more costly as we were there nearly 2 hours for lunch, with no wait to be seated. You gotta really like grilled cheese sandwiches to justify the expenditure."}
{"text":"Horrible service!   Arrived at 5:40pm, took awhile for them to even acknowledge our group of 3.  8 tables were open, but was told the 5:00pm reservations were coming and we would have to wait 40 minutes.   1st impressions are reality.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"I came here on 2 separate occasions. Once for dinner and once for brunch. Overall the food is pretty good. It's pretty much gourmet grilled cheese, which was really heavy. But still good. I got the big che-bowski, which was delicious. Very greasy though. If you're looking to be healthy, don't even bother coming here. 

Brunch was ok. Bottomless mimosas for $15 was what I came for. I got an omelet and honestly it was meh. It was over cooked and kind of hard. The texture just wasn't right for an omelet. I wouldn't recommend for brunch unless you're really into bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Place was great the whole concept is pretty cool. Went here last night to send off my girlfriends sister who is moving away. Granted there was 14 of us and things always get a little hectic when there is that many in a group. Our server couldn't have been anymore accommodating and nice but when the food started to arrive at the table his helper couldn't have been anymore rude. Now I'm not one to bitch because the whole evening was fine but when you're trying to help out a server and I'm trying to help you out where the plates go don't be a douche bag. It was obvious that you were having a bad day but when a party of 14 comes in on a wednesday night and spends over 300+ dollars at your working establishment the last thing you want to do is be a dick."}
{"text":"I went during their first week open for lunch. I had been meaning to check out the Shadyside location for awhile so when I heard they were opening a Market Square location, it seemed like the perfect place to grab lunch on a workday. The menu had so many delicious-sounding options, it was hard to choose what to eat. I decided on The Jerk - a pulled pork & slaw grilled cheese. The taste was good but the slaw was too watery and made it such a mess to eat that I ended up resorting to a knife and fork. Unfortunately, the tomato soup that was served on the side was so disgusting that I ended up taking only one bite. It tasted like a bowl of smoky marinara.... which I suppose could be good if you are into that, but it isn't tomato soup. I would still go back and try the other grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu and would like to check it out for happy hour as they have a lot of great beers on tap."}
{"text":"First time here! The food was amazing and it was busy, no surround it was a Saturday night! Tried to play ping pong but all of the equipment was already rented. No one was playing but they said once someone takes the equipment they can hold onto it until they're ready go play (which I think is unfair). They should be more organized and have a time limit. So we didn't play any games, just took some pics and left. But overall, I loved the atmosphere, food and drinks! Although they are pretty expensive!"}
{"text":"Overall, a great place and would come again.

I got the Dr. Dobak - Provolone / Cheddar / Short Rib / Strawberry Onion Jam / Onion Rings

I like to cut my burgers/sandwiches in half before eating them. And that cut showed just how much juice the short ribs had! The meat was tender, and everything was easy to cut. The only downside was that the short ribs had so much juice that the bottom loaf became soggy, so I ate it upside down. You'll need to get your hands a little dirty for this, but definitely worth it. Originally, I was a little worried about that \"Strawberry onion jam\" but I didn't taste any strawberry flavor at all. 
I got their garlic parm chips. Nothing really spectacular but still decent. 
The tomato soup that goes with the set is some really good tomato soup. Very thick but refreshing. It's the type that if you scoop the soup all towards one side, it was somewhat slowly slide back to even.
Highly recommend this if you're starving, want a good meal, and then enter food coma for the next 2 hours while sitting in your couch watching Netflix. Would also recommend getting gelato or ice cream afterwards."}
{"text":"good food, great atmosphere...definitely one of the best places to go in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Huh? What? Really???!!!

How is it possible that this outdoor area only has 3 stars? I'm outraged!!!

Wake up Yelpers! Can any of you point me to a better patio in Phoenix? 

I'm not reviewing the restaurants (which I do like), not the service, but the outdoor area, WHICH IS AWESOME. Ping pong, bags, tons of SHADED space to just sit and chill, and you can drink while doing it... What's not to love?

When I come, I just go into the bar and get my drinks from the bartender... Quick, easy, no problemo!

I'm thinking that the poor ratings must be from people that were born on some other planet where they must have Ferris wheels and tea cup rides in every back yard, so a patio like this is no big deal.

I strongly suggest you check it out. I also strongly suggest you leave your children at home, or supervise them closely. To me, its a \"bar patio\", for adults, not a place for kids to be running around. I've never had any problems with this, but can see that it could be an issue."}
{"text":"I've been to The Yard before twice, and the atmosphere was so casual and pleasant that I stayed for hours. Went on a Saturday afternoon, and it has sadly now become a Chuck E Cheese.  Tons of young children running around with no parental supervision. Too many large birthday parties. The place has lost its charm."}
{"text":"Came for brunch today, the short rib mac and snozzberry pancakes were fantastic. Got the loaded bloody mary which was solid but a little acidic even for being tomato juice. The highlight of the entire trip was definitely the service. Julie was outstanding, upbeat , friendly, knew her menu, and didn't miss a beat refilling a ridiculous amount of bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"First experience, just got some delivery via Uber eats and hot damn was that tasty. Blarney stoner was still hot upon arrival, gravy and meat were delicious, French fries could have cooked a little longer but they tasted good. Mac n cheese for a side was an excellent decision as well, the cheese sauce was a nice mix of Gouda and cheddar and the bacon lardons were a fantastic touch. 5/5 would definitely eat again"}
{"text":"I went to the Yard with 2 other girls for brunch. I loved their menu. The brunch menu looked good, but the regular menu was much more appealing to me. They have so many different grilled cheeses to choose from. I got the one with buffalo chicken dip that came with chips and tomato soup. It was called \"frank the tank\", which made me laugh. The sandwich was delicious! The homemade chips were really good too. The tomato soup was just okay. I could take it or leave it. They had a Bloody Mary bar that I didn't get, but someone else in my party did and enjoyed. My favorite thing about the yard was their $3 full pint white lightenings on Sunday! It's my favorite beer and not many places in the area have it. We also had really good service. I will be returning to the yard and am looking forward to trying another gourmet grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is flat out amazing. From the waiting staff to the atmosphere and most importantly the food, I give it an all around A+. 

Starting off with the food. I ordered the fried chicken entree, and out of the various fried chickens I have eaten this has topped them all. The crispy/juicy ratio has been perfected to the tee. The flavor is sweet yet savory, enabling a mouth watering sensation I have never experienced with this dish. Seriously, if you come here order the fried chicken entree and it will blow ur mind x100.

Next, the cocktail and draft beer selection is quite extensive and I admire their cocktail selection catered to everyone's spirit preference. Their kilt lifter beer is definitely a good option to go for. However for you stout lovers the selection is limited to a Guinness only, bummer.

The atmosphere of this place is phenomenal. Great people, young crowd, and so many activities. You can't go wrong with good food, drinks, and activities. 

Overall, this joint is an exceptional representation of Arizona's chilliest spots. Come here and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come and enjoy great drinks , & some good live music on the weekends with friends. Highly recommend this place to anyone that has not been before , I love that they have multiple games in the yard as well. Great ambiance overall!
Here I had some antipasti plates: 
Crusty bread with garlic oil & balsamic, some Korean style Brussels sprouts . & a plate of hummus! And some \"copper-less mules\""}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Service was also nice. Food was universally subpar especially considering the prices. Everything was over cooked."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best drinks, the atmosphere is so fun and the food is great! I always take my family here while they're in town to visit and they love all the games! Definitely a go to stop for a low key, fun night out!"}
{"text":"Myself and my girlfriend decided to come check out the new place after hearing about the atmosphere and outdoor environment.  Being fans of Sam Fox in general, it was an easy risk to take on a Friday night with perfect weather.  The place just opened so I expected it to be packed especially with the perfect 80 degree weather we had.  Parking is a mild issue but they provide complimentary valet which is nice. 
 
When we arrived we were told it would be an hour to an hour and a half wait which we were ok with.  They use an app that alerts you via email and gives you a party count that updates as tables turn.  I really liked this as we were able to roam and have some drinks out in the yard all while having a good idea of our tables ETA.  I have read that some people have experienced reservation issues and unfortunately we witnessed this as well.  As we were about to be sat, a group of 8 got there page and came to discover that the host made the reservation for two because she saw two people.  I felt really bad for them knowing they waited just as long as us and that they would have a hard time getting a table for 8 right in the middle of the Friday night dinner rush.

Some have complained about the noise, it is loud but this isn't Maestros and you should know that.  We don't have kids but I did like that it's a family environment, very cool concept that I would like to see in North Scottsdale.  The crowd as a whole was very good as well, no hipsters, bros, dickheads, frat guys or yuppies.  I really enjoyed the couple hours of drinking and eating we spent there and will return.

I'm not really going to get in to the food too  much because it's nothing new if you have been to Culinary Dropout.  The ribs, fried chicken, pretzels, and sandwiches are all good.  I've never had a bad meal at Dropout, the menu holds no risk to most diners.  

My overall summary, of all the Sam Fox restaurants this is the coolest/most enjoyable place in my eyes.  I will return many times, despite it being a bit of a drive from North Scottsdale.  If it weren't for the great environment, I would give it 4 stars simply for the stellar menu, but it really is as good as it gets for someone like myself."}
{"text":"I can only speak for happy hour & for citizen public house food & it was all good. Staff capable & speedy. Great happy hour specials & nice playful atmosphere. It attracted a little of everybody from dates, fams, 20 something hipsters & seniors even. Definitely a place for everyone. Didn't get a chance to play any games but it's on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Not vegan friendly, not even vegetarian friendly. 

The ambiance is relaxed but parking is non existent,  plan to Uber or pay them money to valet your car."}
{"text":"Just had a meal off of the brunch meal. It was really GOOD ! it was a loaded breakfast bowl with all the fixing. You get a ton of food for the price. Lengthy beer list with a variety  selection, price accordingly. I would certainly suggest eating here. Im going to have a gourmet grilled cheese next time i come as they looked absolutely spectacular and i found out that they are know for that. Overall  great experience"}
{"text":"I had such an excellent experience at the yard in the galleria! I came here on a busy Friday night around 6 with a couple of friends expecting to have a bit of a wait. Wrong! We were seated immediately and soon after our waiter, Anthony L came over to grab our drinks. He was so pleasant and friendly! He swiftly came back with our drinks and we put in our food order. Maybe 10 minutes later our food came out and everything was right! I got the Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad and it was great! The chicken was cooked perfectly. I'm always a little iffy with chicken but this was amazing! There was just enough of everything in the salad. 
We were in and out within an hour & I was so thoroughly impressed with this visit! Everything from the quick service, great waiter, and awesome food, the Yard earned my 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great spot. I wish there was a place like this in LA. It's super relaxed with good food and fun games.  The space itself is awesome... Like a covered tent, almost, with a trendy restaurant inside. We went on a Sunday, so I imagine that there are more people there at that time than any other day, but it'd be awesome if there were more ping pong tables and bean bag toss games. 

Our food was rocking too. Giant burgers, good wine, good beer. My friend got the brown bag special - $2.00 for a random canned beer. How fun is that!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and all time favorite sandwich... the Blarney Stoner - not as heavy as you'd think, great flavor profile and paired with the tomato soup is a great blend. It's loud - it's a sports bar that wants to be more but knows its roots and fills a niche - great selection of beers and food... I literally plan trips to Pittsburgh around coming here"}
{"text":"It is a bit difficult to describe this place as it continues to struggle to find what kind of place it should be. Is it a lounge? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? It contains three restaurants (Culinary Dropout, Bario Urbano and Little Cleo's) that don't have anything in common and combined together with a forced social atmosphere of a covered patio with all sorts of yard games that are played by drunk adults with very little respect for each other. This establishment manages to bring together the worst people from all walks of life into one convenient location. If you arrive and it is not busy, you have the opportunity to receive decent service and be served some overpriced bar food. If you arrive and it's incredibly busy, you have the opportunity to receive terrible service and the same overpriced bar food. The redeeming quality of the entire establishment is Little Cleo's which actually does provide a great menu and intimate service. It's a shame it has to be nestled away in this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to say that I love all of the Fox RC's but my visit to The Yard this past weekend was just average. 
I think what soured my mood to start the evening was the handling of our reservation. My wife and I had made a reservation for a fairly decent sized group for a Friday night, and requested the patio. They had told us they would accommodate that, which was greatly appreciated. However, upon attempting to seat us, they said that patio was unavailable and would be an extra 45 mins. That being said, we agreed to sit inside, where they attempted to sit our party at 2 seperate tables which were not exactly close to each other. So we had to do some rearranging to set up a cramped space in the corner for our entire party to be seated together. 
Now, I don't want to think that a mix up with the seating/reservation is a reason to completely bash The Yard. That's something that you know won't necessarily happen on every occasion. However, the food I thought was just average. Good, but not great. The beer selection was also good, which I also took as a nice plus. 
I would say that despite feeling unsatisfied after my first visit, I still will definitely go back and hopefully get an opportunity to enjoy some of the outdoor activities."}
{"text":"I  l i k e d   t h i  s  p l a c e  ! ! ! !

In fact I liked it a lot, but I must claim that it is a bit overpriced. Not for HH though, and I was here for it. It is funny how you can see what that tried to convey, and by them I mean the people that thought up this place.. designed a laid back atmosphere around an existing building that used to be a motorcycle dealership or something to that effect. 

Service was nice, and both males and females seem to be instructed in how to dress and how to act. Dress - hipsteriffic nerdy kitsch, and act - semi-upscale nice. And they almost pull it off on both accounts, and I will not say a negative word about it due to the fact that they seem to pull it of. And by pull it off, I mean create revenue.

I can only talk about the Yard section, which is a roof covered outside area that has plenty of places to sit and it is quite cozy. They have fussball and corn-hole and other outside yard-crap that is very cool, but I didn't take advantage of these sweet activities. Instead I planted myself in a cozy chair and have great conversation while I sucked down some tasty wheat brews. The food looked nice, and they all said it tasted good. I saved room for some more tasty wheat brew.

An odd, but cool detail is that when you walk into the mens room, you see that the.. nope, I leave that surprise to you. I laughed though. To myself, not out loud. That would just been weird. 

Come see this place for yourself, because I cant tell the story to give it justice. 

.. und das ist, wie üblich, nach der Kritiker

Ps. The parking is crappy. Valet only."}
{"text":"I love this place, I have been to this location (twice) as well as the one in Shadeyside. 

The prices are sort of high but it is worth it because the food is great. They have multiple food options such as an assortment of grilled cheese, burgers, flatbread sandwiches and salads. For the sides you can choose from an option of different fries, tomato soup, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, a veggie of the day or fruit. 

At this location I've had the crabby patty grilled cheese and the turkey burger, both times with the sweet potato fries as my side. The sweet potato fries come with a side of cinnamon butter to dip them in it and it so delicious. I would highly recommend this place for lunch, a dinner get together, or a date. 

I wouldn't suggest coming here if there is a big event going on downtown because it gets really crowded and really loud. A friend and I came to this location after work on St. Patricks day and there were so many people in there we couldn't hear each other when we got seated. It also took our waiter a long time to even great us and take our drink order."}
{"text":"i'm super in love with this place! A buddy of mine lives in the area and I hadn't been yet, so we rode our bikes on over. It's a HUMONGOUS place with a seafood bar, regular bar food and a HUGE entertainment area with bean bag tossing, ping pong and foosball tables. I'm super excited to come back here as I can ride my bike inside and just hang!"}
{"text":"5 stars so far. This place models itself after 3 bar/restaurants in Dallas: Lee Harvey's  (the 1st of its kind that I know of, then 2 bars there that modeled themselves after Lee Harvey's), Katy Trail Icehouse, and The Foundry. 

All of those spots in Dallas are extremely popular for the same reason I enjoy this place. The only difference is that you can smoke in \"The Yard\" at all of those Dallas joints, but not here. Oh, and in Dallas only Lee Harvey's has outdoor fire, whereas The Yard does, but it's a natural gas fire, not wood like Lee Harvey's.

Anyway, I just ate the delicious black Muscles (for $12) that were really good (!), but not the best I've had. I'm a spoiled brat though."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the food. It was good. When we got our bill, our drinks were unbelievably high. Our whiskey was $14.00/glass. Then they charged $4.20/glass for ice!!!  Then we looked at another, and they charged $6.75 for a rum and coke with $0.25 for Coke. This place is BS"}
{"text":"the place gets the best ratings when it comes to the atmosphere. The service was mediocre, the food was mediocre, but the atmosphere and the selection of beer was incredible.
might be a good place to hang with the guys and do a fantasy draft?"}
{"text":"The food at The Yard is excellent. No matter what you're in the mood for, there is something for you. My favorite part of the yard though, is the beer selection. There are so many different local beer to choose from, you can always find something good. This location has plenty of seating, and a great location in market square."}
{"text":"Venue and good were outstanding!!  Service was excellent as well!  Lots of stuff to do while you hang out."}
{"text":"Very solid experience. Food is very good with a vibrant (loud) atmosphere. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Yard is an open fun environment.  I buddy of mine came from Sin City to visit. Knowing how Sin City is a non stop playground of food and beverages I thought he would be bored with whatever we have to offer in the midtown area. Since The Yard is super close we walked over after arriving from the west side, the Coyotes killed the Blues 6-0. We were both impressed by the great smile that greeted us from the hostess booth. We made our way to the bar passed a live musical act playing and singing Purple Rain, pretty cool! We found a spot and as if the timing couldn't be anymore perfect we were greeted by 2 bartenders who took our drink orders within 1 a minute. Let s just say everything went smoothly and the drinks tasted great and our appetizers where on point. As we chatted it up even making a few friends at the bar, we moved to the corn hole area to play a game. In the end my buddy tells as we are walking home that he really wished he had Yard by his place. Validated! The last missing star was for the pork cracklens, weird seasoning."}
{"text":"Good for comfort food and beer. If that's what you're looking for, you've come to the right place. Do not come for the bottomless mimosas, it's 100% juice."}
{"text":"This place is popular downtown during lunchtime for grilled cheese. I've been here 3 times (forced by coworkers) and I've never found any meal memorable. 
They take two slices of bread and put each one on the griddle with your cheese and let them get somewhat hot - then they mash the other ingredients inside and smash the sandwich together. 
My point being grilled cheeses should be hot and guey cheese. These aren't. The cheese was only melted on the outside and the tomatoes inside were COLD! 
I've also had the lettuce wraps - again nothing memorable. 
My point: I can make a better grilled cheese sandwich at home and save myself $10!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool concept... happy hour was good.  A great variety of games to play. The food was pretty tasty too.  The only problem I had was the watered down fireball!  They charge seven bucks for a shot which is normal-overpriced but you don't even get what you're paying for.  Yes we noticed it guys... good try lol other than that it's a decent place to hangout."}
{"text":"Oh how I love the Yard! I have been here so many times that I have lost count. If you like grilled cheese this is your place. They do have a good selection of other items as well, but I recommend the grilled cheese sammies. AND...on the weekends they have bottomless mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar during brunch. Can it get any better? But if those aren't your thing, they also have a nice selection of beers on draft.  
This location at Market Square is not the largest so I would recommend making a reservation for busy times of the day. The waiters, bartenders and other staff are always friendly. I've never had a bad experience here. The mac and cheese bites are a great app to order before your meal. And I am a big fan of the Cheesy Capresey sandwich. 
If you're looking for a laid back spot for lunch or brunch you can't go wrong with The Yard."}
{"text":"I'm excited anytime I get to go to the Yard! It's a huge indoor/outdoor restaurant with lots of space & cool decor. Great for all kinds of occasions! The patio has fun seating like couches & lawn chairs. They have games like ping pong & bags. & the food is really good! Two of my favorite dishes are actually appetizers or \"Shares\" as they call them - the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, & the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos. Seriously, to die! & all the staff from the hostesses to the waiters & even to the valet are always upbeat & attentive! They'll make you feel welcome & taken care of but not rushed! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"The best pieces of Culinary Dropout - put together in an awesome Arcadia-esque scene, right in North Phoenix. If you're in the area, swing on by - grab some great cocktails/beer - enjoy a tasty bite - and be a kid for a while playing some classic outdoor games. This is the type of place I can spend a whole afternoon at. Expect this place to get busy and stay busy. Official new stomping grounds of \"Sunday Funday-ers\" everywhere.

- Good live music with built in stage setup
- Enormous covered patio with astro turf area
- Covered bike parking inside (keep those cruisers safe!)
- Joint bathroom sinks provide funny and awkward moments
- Soon to open oyster bar sure to add more unique options
- Enough space for more of Sam Fox's brain children"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for casual gatherings. On the happy hour menu I would recommend the grilled cheese sliders and french fries. Perfect size and cheap! The complimentary valet is a huge bonus. The bathroom layout if not my favorite, but I would still recommend."}
{"text":"This place had me confused from the get go. First off, no parking except for valet, which even though is free you still always tip so it's not free. Is this Phoenix AZ or Los Angeles CA? The neighbors around this place must be pissed, if you don't use valet you have to park in front of their houses. The valet lot is tiny so they run out of room very quickly.

Second, is this a nice restaurant, a sports bar, or a playground for children? I was greeted with a line of about 20 people before we could even speak to a hostess so we just walked into the bar/playground area on our own. After wandering around looking for a seat a little tabled opened up and we took it. Uncomfortable little metal stools and a rickety wood top was what we had to deal with. There was no wait staff coming around to any of these tables so we got a beer from the corner beer bucket girl. $5.25 for a can of Fat Tire. A can. Not very impressive. I suppose I could have walked up to the bar area but it was stacked 2 deep with people waiting to get their drinks as well so I decided to go for the easy way out.

The shuffleboard game was being used by some 6 year old kids who were playing with the sand and not the pucks but the board itself looked like a cheap one and was not very long. We decided to pass up that game and hoped to play ping pong since there were two tables empty. When we went up front to get the paddles the hostess said \"I guess the people who have those paddles are eating or something\" and we were not allowed to play. The tables sat empty until we left. I noticed on the two tables that were going that there were many instances where people walking down the path were almost hit by the pong players. Ping pong doesn't seem like a good fit for the small space they put it in. Bean bags perhaps, shuffleboard sure, ping pong no.

I can't comment on the food because we never had a chance to order any and the wait for getting inside the restaurant was over an hour. I am sure the food is descent since it is a Fox establishment but the prices I saw seemed a bit steep. 

Again, I am not sure what this place is all about but it definitely didn't feel right to me. I don't want to be hanging out with my friends drinking adult beverages and dodging 5 year old kids who are screaming and running around with no supervision. Is this place meant for families with small kids? Is it mean for college people? Is it made for jocks? Girls that like to get all dressed up? Older folks? Locals? I saw all of these people there and everyone looked out of place to me. 

It will be interesting to see how it works during the summer time, I didn't see any misters in that outdoor game area. Good luck Yard, I doubt I will make it back though."}
{"text":"While I'm sure it can get overly busy and obnoxious, that's the drawback of creating a place with so much fun stuff. However, at 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday it's the perfect place for my 7-year-old, his soccer team, and numerous siblings to run around and play games like cornhole (beanbag toss), ping-pong, and foosball while the parents get to have conversation and enjoy a few adult beverages.

Service was quick and the food was quite good - I had the grilled chicken club and my boys had the mac and cheese.

In sum, this is a great place for everyone, families, couples, singles, etc. Now I really want to ride my bike over, have a few drinks, watch a few games. Honestly, this would be a great place to just camp out during the first few days of the NCAA Basketball Tournament."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great live music, tons of ping pong tables and cornhole boards, and great drinks/service.  Add to that complimentary valet parking and it was a perfect night out."}
{"text":"Ok. So I have been here in the past on a Saturday afternoon, and hello douchebagery! There is nowhere to sit, stand, you fight for a drink, and the oeople playing cornhole are playing all day. Don't plan on them leaving. Because they will keep a game going all day by shuffling participants. No courtesy, no time limit... no one else gets a chance to play. Same is for shuffleboard. There is no courtesy.

Fast forward to about a year later.. and a Sunday night. Super pleasant. Had some awesome pretzels and cheese, buffalo chicken meatballs were excellent, service was awesome, misters and swamp coolers on full blast. Was delightful. No lingering, or stalking people to get a spot/game/drink. 

Biggest grudge is beers in cans. Hey.. buy a keg of Papago Orange blossom.. please. Draft is better than a can, and quite frankly why I go to the bar. Good thing I was safe with Kiltlifter on draft. 

Overall, a cool place. Just pick your days. Oh and PS, they allow kids so this is good or bad. You choose.

{"text":"I was very excited to finally go to the Yard in my area! I have been to The Yard preciously at a different location and I was excited there was one closer. I went on a Friday night with a few co-workers. My friend used the Open Table app to make a reservation, which I highly suggest doing! We ate dinner, but mainly went for the drinks. There were a lot of beer options and some cocktails. For dinner, I had the Mother of Dragons sandwich. It was a grilled chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese, jalapeños and a chipotle ranch sauce. I loved it!!! I had their regular house chips (which there were many different seasonings I could have chose from) and substituted a Caesar salad for the tomato soup. We were there for close to 4 hours, drinking, eating and catching up, so it was nice to not be rushed out of there, even if it was busy. I would definitely go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Great place to come and unwind! The food choices as well as the ability to eat in or outdoors makes the Yard a great place to relax with family and friends!

If you're wanting a large array of beers as well, The Yard carries a bunch of different types of great tasting varieties.

Whether winter cold or summer hot be sure to check out the Yard and play table tennis, as well as cornhole.  Keep up the great customer service The Yard!"}
{"text":"This is my first time in town and the first place I ate, and I must say: Excellent choice!! My friends and I ate from the grill cheese side of the menu. The fried green tomato was DELICIOUS, as well as the Los Pollos Hermanos and Crabby Patty. Our server Megan was very nice and informative. If I lived in Pittsburgh I would eat here all of the time!"}
{"text":"It's such a shame to give this place a bad review. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and pretty good food, but the service was AWFUL. 
There was an incident, and the manager David Parks handled it so unprofessionally. He was antagonizing and completely disrespectful. When members of our party responded to his rude demeanor, he called the cops. An entire situation could have been avoided with a professional and qualified manager."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and you get a great amount of food for what you pay. Sitting outside is my favorite and the Pretzel Bites are the best!"}
{"text":"Quick review time at work!  Just Wow, absolutely amazing.  I've been coming here on Sundays for the last two months, and I've always had a great time, but today went to an even greater level.  Great adult hangout place, 4 hours of ping ping I played today and there was no pressure to leave or buy anything.  GM Jason came and checked in on us and was gracious, friendly, and would be a credit to any restaurant.  Had the Rainbow Trout at Culinary Dropout attached restaurant, beautifully cooked flaky with green beans/almondine sauce, one of my fav seafood dishes to order in AZ."}
{"text":"Unfortunately cannot comment on the quality of the food or the beverages as the service - at least from the young lady behind the bar- was beyond horrible as we sat there for 10 min waiting for her to acknowledge our presence and after wiping the countertop in front of us and looking up multiple times while ignoring our \"excuse me ma'am\" she walked away...so we did to."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon The Yard yesterday while perusing Market Square for a new lunch spot with one of my co-workers. It didn't appear to have a long wait, so we decided to eat there and I'm delighted we did! 

The service was fantastic. My co-worker is a vegetarian and couldn't decide between the garden burger and grilled cheese, so he asked the waiter. The waiter was also a vegetarian and was honest with him. He steered him away from the garden burger due to its lack of flavor, so my co-worker decided on the Cheesy Capresey and really enjoyed it. 

I also ordered grilled cheese, The Big-Chewboaki. It was amazing. I love the combination of egg with the Texas toast style bread. It came with a small, perfectly portioned for dipping, tomato soup and homemade chips. I got old bay flavored. The chips were crispy and flavorful and were a perfect complement. 

The atmosphere inside was also nice. They have a pretty big bar and there were a good bit of patrons having a few drinks before the Pirate game. 

Overall, my first experience at The Yard in market square was great!"}
{"text":"Complimentary valet but get there early. Great craft beer selection as well as creative cocktail menu. Ping pong and corn-toss my favorites. Bar staff has been great every time we've been in. Appetizers are all awesome, pretty good burgers too."}
{"text":"I visited The Yard for the first time for a business lunch yesterday and I'm still not totally sure what I think.

The location is on the second floor of the building, with a dark stairway leading up.  If anyone in your party has any mobility challenges, this is not the place for you. It was packed, even before the noon rush, but we were able to get a seat without a reservation.

The service was overly attentive, though I guess that I would prefer that to inattentive, particularly at the lunch hour when you're trying to get back to the office.  My dining companion was asked at least 3 times if she was done with her tomato soup (she was not!).  The check was on our table shortly after our entrees were delivered (I do not mind this for lunch, but it did feel like we were being pushed).

The food was fair.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it wasn't bad.  I had the Young Cheezy (minus the onions).  The bread was nicely toasted and held up well.  For a place that specializes in grilled cheeses, they sure skimp on the cheese (I noticed other reviews mentioning this).  The chorizo and potato hash on the sandwich had good flavor, but the chorizo could've been cooked a bit longer to give it better texture.

The grilled cheeses all come with tomato soup and potato chips.  The tomato soup was good, but the vessel that it is served in is rather small.  It is too narrow to effectively dip your grilled cheese - which is the best part of grilled cheese and tomato soup!  There are several flavors of potato chips to pick from.  I chose the garlic parm.  The chips were good (obviously homemade), but really, they just shook a canister of Kraft parmesan cheese over them and called it a day.  There was no hint of garlic whatsoever, and the cheese was only on the very top few chips.

The entrees are creatively named, but awkward.  Who wants to order a \"Smack Yo Mama\" in front of a business contact or boss?

Since this place is still pretty new, I'll definitely try it again.  I also wish that they offered a more simple grilled cheese as an option. Sometimes that would hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Yard many times and have never been disappointed.  I typically go with coworkers one on one or in groups.  The restaurant is known for their cheese sandwiches and they don't disappoint.  However, may favorite is the steak salad.  It is huge, full of steak and fries and a fried egg.  The value is good and the service is very quick for a business lunch.

I have also been for both informal and large planned/catered happy hours.  The food and drink are great and happy hour specials are also competitive with other downtown spots."}
{"text":"We met some friends at the Yard to celebrate my birthday.  As you've likely ascertained from previous reviews, the place is gigantic and has lots of games and fun things to do which makes it great for a chill Sunday afternoon.  Allow me to start with the bad since this is a new restaurant and I hope the people at Fox are still seeking feedback......cause besides a few quirks this place is awesome!

The Yard utilizes a cell phone paging system to call your table which is great, I hate those dumb pager things.  We had to wait for our friends so we found a few open seats at the end of the bar to wait.  When I say end of the bar: Imagine a long, square wooden bar surface with maybe.... 30-40 seats on the long ends and 2 seats on the short.  Well, we proceeded to wait, for 15 minutes, while not a single one of the 10+ servers acknowledged out presence.  This is not an exaggeration, I know it was 15 minutes because that handy cell phone paging system buzzes you after you put your name in.  

We could actually see the servers scan the long end of the bar and their eyes never made it to the short end, it was entirely as if we were invisible.  On my birthday, I was invisible.  Thanks a lot, Fox.  We actually watched a female server service one group of guys 3 SEPARATE ROUNDS of drinks,  and a couple of ladies 2!  SERIOUSLY.  And the place is loud enough that you cant casually lean over and say, '\"excuse me...\"'.  Eventually, I yelled:  '\"EXCUSE ME, IS THERE BAR SERVICE OVER HERE???\"\"  If you can frickin believe it this bartender responded \"Yes\" without coming over to take our drink order!!!  She seemed surprised when I followed up my rude inquiry with: \"I would like to order a drink\".  Cause, you know, I am sitting at the bar.  Waiting......   She never did come over, a different bartender (who had also been ignoring us) eventually came over.  

The thing is....  they were not actually ignoring us.  They never even noticed we were sitting there.  They were soooo focused on pumping up the local D Bags with shots and PBR they never even brought us a menu.  We WATCHED their eyes scan the bar and stop 2 feet short of us.  If anyone even cares, the d bags stayed to play games, while the chicks finished off about 12 rounds of whiskey, straight up, before teetering off to the valet.  Awesome.  

Anyway, everything else is exactly what you would expect from a new restaurant + culinary dropout.  The server is over attentive, everyone checks your ID 15 times, there are 5 hostess's crowded around a tiny station.  The food is good, Arrogant Butcher is better IMO, and so similar I wont bore you with the details.  We had a great experience due to our friends being there, and once the Sunday Funday crowd cleared out around 8pm we played Fooseball and Ping Pong.  They also have shuffle board and bean bag toss, and a ton of tables crowded around gas fireplaces ala fancy backyard (fun!)  You should know that if you want a drink while playing games you have to go up to the bar, which is strange and not obvious.  Servers will walk around the games area, but they dont take orders, and they dont bus dirty tables, and they are annoyed if you ask for a drink as if you should know this already (THEY NEED A SIGN, MMMK?)  We did see a bartender get a new keg and slam down a pint in the stock room which was funny.  

So, in conclusion, despite my poor review, we did have a really good time and I left satiated and satisfied.  Once they work out the kinks this place will be an American Beergarden of Awesomeness.  I highly suggest you hit it up during an 'off' period (no HH, Fri/Sat)  so you can utilize the games and get a sweet table.    This would be a great place to get to know a new date or just kick it with old friends, and the food is legit."}
{"text":"After unsuccessfully attempting to locate something good to eat in Market Square we decided on the Yard. This is a place that centers their menu around grilled cheese sandwiches. Now who doesnt like grilled cheese sandwiches?

We ordered the chicken wings with a jerk seasoning dry rub and  a standard grilled cheese sandwhich. The sandwhiches all come with tomoatoe soup, but we said hold that soup not a fan of tomato soup in general.

The grilled cheese sandwiches were a little much, with combos and ingredients that just weren't really that appealing. They dont have a standard grilled cheese. Meaning bread and cheese. So we asked them to hold all of the hooplah and give us a standard sandwhich.

The wings with that seasoning were on point. They were sweet and salty at the same time. The fries were so dissapointing, they were soft and floppy. Who like floppy fries? Not me. Lastly, the grilled cheese was just ok."}
{"text":"Everything here is phenomenal in my opinion except culinary dropouts food. Have eaten here multiple times, but I'm simply not a fan. The price is high, and I'm always slightly disappointed in what I get. The yard itself is simply amazing. Great venue."}
{"text":"The SO and i went here, second time checking this place out. Bottomless mimosa and a bottomless bloody mary bar. YES PLEASE.  The food was not a huge hit with us. I found my grilled cheese to be less of a grilled cheese and more of a warm sandwich with some slightly melted cheese on it.
The bloody bar was nice. The options were pretty stellar. 
The mimosa (which my partner got) were disappointing, I'd save your money if I were you.  
The \"bottomless\" booze brunch is a bit expensive, and I'd probably save my money and atleast go having already eaten and munch on olives and celery and bacon (yeah.. they get an extra star for having bacon on the bloody mary bar).

Things of note: there was a girl in the bathroom THE ENTIRE TIME we were there I think she was crying/shitting/puking. Anyway it made peeing awkward. She was in there before i walked in, and for the remainder of the 1.5 hours I was there. iterally... THE WHOLE TIME."}
{"text":"Fun!!!  Came here with a work group and we definately enjoyed the games that were available.  The drinks were pricey but very well made.  Our waitress was helpful, fast and completely adorable!  The only suggestion I have is that if customers move over to pay games, you have your servers move over and take care of them regardless of their location."}
{"text":"Some friends and I had a later Saturday lunch at the Yard.  We arrived around 1 on a Saturday and were quickly seated.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  All three of us had a beer from their extensive draft list.

I ordered from the brunch menu and had the chicken and waffles sliders.  A side of home fries accompanied the meal.  My meal was 12.00 which seemed a little pricey but it was excellent.  My two friends both had grilled cheese of some sorts and enjoyed theirs.  

This is a great little bar with a fantastic location in Market Square.  I look forward to my next visit.  This would be a fantastic happy hour stop.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Bottomless \"Mimosas\" just taste like plain O.J. For $15 don't do it, you will be better off ordering 2 beers instead, you will get more buzz out of that. Not that many brunch options ended up ordering a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Nice decor and good service. The grilled cheese sandwiches are okay, but they aren't very big and the bread they make them on is nothing special. I have been to other grilled cheese joints such as Melt in Cleveland that were a million times better. Their other food is pretty good though, I often find myself getting the yard walker which is very delicious. The food isn't anything special but it's a fun place to come to with friends or to watch a Steelers game at the bar."}
{"text":"Nothing was bad everything was just okay. 

Service was very attentive but we came before a game and have to agree it does seem like at times they are trying to turn tables.

My boyfriend really liked it a lot better- we both got the pulled pork grilled cheese and I thought the meet could be more flavorful.

He said the fries were very good but I did not get them.

Good location but not a lot of tables. We did make a reservation ."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Can be a little expensive for a grilled cheese, depending on which you get. A group of my coworkers and I went here for lunch a little after it opened. The idea of grilled cheese sounds great for lunch but once you look at the options, the sandwiches are all pretty heavy. Each sandwich also comes with chips and their tomato soup. They both seem homemade and they tasted alright. I ordered the Mac Attack per recommendation from the waitress. It was her favorite and also the most popular among guests, apparently. The idea of macaroni and cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich sounds great, tastes ok, but it's nearly impossible to eat as a sandwich. Overall, the food is alright. Like I said, not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"Fox does it again. Great food and concept. 
The Yard is working out the kinks in the kitchen and service but that by no means should keep anyone away. I do not think the place is even a week old so be patient and enjoy the view. 
We enjoyed the crispy shrimp salad and the pastrami on pretzel bread. Outstanding on all levels. Price, portion, flavor, execution."}
{"text":"Best assortment of gourmet grilled cheese in town! Daily specials are exceptional, and the fact that they feature a variety of craft beers is irresistible. I have been there for lunch and dinner as well. If I had to recommend a specific sandwich, it would have to be the bison burger. I would also recommend Erin the bartender if you are stopping in for a drink after a long day at the office; she is knowledgeable, experienced, and very friendly. Five star stop without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I am a long time dis-liker of culinary dropout. So when I was taken to \"the yard\" I was unaware of the relationship between them. The instant I found out I had my guard up! To give you a little back story I have a friend that used to work for them and in their code of conduct they are told to \"be cool\" and to translate that means to be the biggest a-hole possible. 

Back to the bar. It was pretty darn cold and only half the heaters were on. So when a table opened up my group of 8-10 all sat down to get warm and continue drinking. Within a few minutes the table nazi kicked us out stating we would have to put our name on a list we would have to order \"full meals\". Who orders a full dinner after 10pm? So we shuffled back to our ice cold corner. The group that was seated there ordered 2 appetizers and maybe one round of drinks. Again we tried to sit at another table that was open for 30 minutes. Got kicked out again because we weren't all going to order a \"full meal\". I can't order anything when you won't let me even sit down. 

We ended up just leaving so I only had 2 drinks that were just full of giant ice cubes. I can make better drinks (and food), so next time I will do my research on who owns the bar. I hate giving business to people who treat you like s**t. Not worth the hassle"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, good beer variety, and excellent place for groups.  Visited multiple times in a week-  the crabby patty grilled cheese was good.  We had great service with a large group."}
{"text":"The yard tries to be trendy and hip.  They have bean bag toss, ping pong tables, a shuffle board, a live band, pretend mixologists, and a wide selection of craft brews.  The concept is absolutely perfect.  

Unfortunately the service is horrendous.  The bartenders are very rude, the waitress will bring your check without notice in order to turn your table, the staff will make you feel unwelcomed, management also acts rude right to your face and the other patrons cut you off in line, bump into you and make you want to find somewhere else to have a drink.  

There is no line or sign up sheet for the games so unless you stand over another group like a stalker there is no other way to play.  The food is okay.  Good for bar food not so much for dining.  The drinks have lots of options such as bacon, thyme, candied ginger, etc but come out very bland.  The bartenders do not know how to properly showcase the ingredients but still manage to charge ten bucks a pop.  

Then they have a decent selection of craft brew but serve it to you in a thick cold mug with a handle.  This isn't bud light here.  Try to show a little respect for the beer you are serving and the customer who appreciates it.  Also, try to teach your staff about the beer they serve.  When I ask what kind of Lagunitas you offer I don't want to hear \"It's an IPA\".  They make several IPAs and all of them are different from each other.  Because they serve people food at the bar for lack of seating there is a hidden line for ordering drinks but no signage and hard to tell because of how crowded it is.  The bartenders rudely told me to get in line after I stood at the bar for 15 minutes without being acknowledged.  Put a freaking sign up if you want people to line up at a certain spot to be served like a homeless soup kitchen.

Another weird thing was there were infants in the bar area.  Not just one but I counted three brand new babies.  As well as several toddlers running around.  I don't think the staff should kick them out but if you are one of those parents that thinks its cool to bring your kids to the bar you sure are classy.  There were also lots of old people there too.  Just a heads up to those looking for a younger hipster crowd.

This seems like another failed concept by Fox in the works.  I'm sure it doesnt look like it considering how busy they are but if they continue to run it like this their time will come.  This guy has great ideas but no concept on how to hire and train staff and always seems to poorly execute.  The place is jam packed so I probably wont be missed.  All I can say is I wont be back."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place.  It's a cool hang out for friends and also great to bring the kids.  Love the ping pong, giant Jenga and corn hole!"}
{"text":"Good service and food it's a little loud but the food and service was great a good place to bring family"}
{"text":"Sorry to say...the service was the worst ever. From start to finish the service was non existent.  No drink refills.  Stale bun on burger. Cold, day old potato chips. No service.   May go back again sometime.  Not anything like a Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids to the yard.  We use to regularly go but after this Friday - forget it.  I had a burger - Yuck - the quality has gone down hill.  Staff of millennials had no idea how to serve -  several had there tops completely open - really a bit desperate and not necessary.
Fox use to be a restaurant genius - now he's just like everyone else.  To Bad."}
{"text":"ordered a Lafferty to go. to my surprise there's NO marinara. just a dry sandwich with cheese, chicken and basil. next time I'm going over to Primanti's for food since they at least make their food as described in the menu."}
{"text":"GREAT bacon bloody mary and breakfast egg sammie! Yum!"}
{"text":"Lots of yummy options on the menu. The service is always fantastic - super friendly, fun and attentive wait staff. A family favorite for Sunday brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Phoenix to hang with friends in the lounge, to catch some live music with Vinyl Station, or to celebrate life events. The food is divine comfort food and of course the pretzels & fondue are a must!! Delicious cocktails and a paperbag beer are a fantastic accompaniment to any dish. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. A must for all."}
{"text":"A great place to go if you're in your 20's, I went with my husband and the food was over the top awesome!  And it was a fun atmosphere, it was really loud so its not a place I would take my parents, but I enjoyed my experience"}
{"text":"The \"yard\" itself is great.  Go for the beer and outdoor are but nothing else.  The last time we were there, it was with about a dozen people and no one was happy about the food or prices.  It may be worthwhile for just the beer and outdoor area.  But, the food is the same TIRED old menu.  Boring!  Further, there is nothing for people with dietary considerations (allergies, etc.) and they aren't trained or even willing to be cautious."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite places.  We often have business acquaintances in town and this is our favorite place to bring them.  It's fun, great environment, phenomenal food, and a fantastic price.  Add in free valet and this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"Food is yummy.  My recent experience was that service was slow - And there wasn't really any good excuse for why.  It was a Saturday early lunch.  People were there but it wasn't super busy.  Parking is annoying.  During the week at lunchtime, you can park yourself. On weekends, they require valet - I'm sure to make it easier for patrons and to be better neighbors of the businesses and homes nearby.  But even complimentary valet still requires you to carry cash for tip (which I rarely have).  It was hot on the patio, so I would recommend sitting inside whenever you can during our hottest months.  I have been super  happy with my meals I've eaten there (and sampled from others).  Be prepared to pay at least $10 per meal. I've not been there when it's been packed, but it sounds crazy. I recommend a long lunch Monday-Saturday."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, decent food, but prices are higher than they should be.

The good:  Lots of space to stretch out.  They have ping pong tables, been bag toss (or whatever it's called), and several other games in the covered outdoor area.  Very cool.  

The bad:  The food is decent, but a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"What a fun time!  Great food and even better service, will definitely go back!  The warm pretzels and cheese fondue from Culinary Dropout- AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have trouble choosing which grilled cheese I want, they all sound delicious. They definitely know their grilled cheese here. Texas toast is always the perfect amount of crunchy, cheese is melted, and the tomato soup with every sandwich is a great to touch. Prices are kind of expensive for grilled cheese in my opinion, but the restaurant atmosphere and variety of options balances it out."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating I was quite anxious and excited to visit the yard for the first time.  Friends of mine had been raving about 'the yard' for weeks.  Unfortunately, the rave reviews are the only pleasant experience I had with 'the yard'.  The appearance and overall architecture of the building are contemporary and clean.  I appreciated that the hostess stand was available and inviting as you walked into the restaurant.  From that point on it was disappointment.  The restaurant and outdoor area were vacant, but mysteriously there were no tables available for 45 minutes to an hour.  We then asked if we could stand at the bar and order drinks and were told its fine, but to make sure we left enough room for other patrons to maneuver.  Since this was a first time experience we ordered our drinks and began to walk around the facility.  We noticed empty table after empty table.  We determined it would be okay to claim one as our own.  We did that and no one seemed to mind.  Strange that there were no tables, but when we claimed on as our own we received service once.  No one asked us to leave or vacate to allow for a reserved patron.  

As stated previously we received service once.  From that point on even though we had a large party we had to order our own food and drinks at the bar area.  We also had to deliver it to ourselves.  Having sat for a few minutes I decided to take notice of my surroundings.  As I looked around I couldn't help but notice the melancholy stares of the employees and customers.  I noticed that this place is filled with the pretentious and snooty.  I remember when I was 20 years old sitting in bars and leaving my keys out so people knew what I was driving.  But, these were grown adults flaunting their Maserati, Rolls Royce and Bentley keys.  The parking lot already allowed me to indulge in a car show.  I don't care who belongs to which car.  That really does not impress me.  I believe the biggest folly of this establishment is that it does not quite designate if it is a bar/restaurant or daycare.  I must mention that I was there on a Friday afternoon following a spring training baseball game.  Many parents were there after school with their children.  While they were enjoying their afternoon cocktails and wine I had to listen to their children bang on the metal garbage cans, run around screaming and my personal favorite rolling on the ground up to my heels.  I actually had to tell several children that I had enough and move things around.  The kids also took the bean bags and instead of playing corn hole were playing dodge ball with them.  I became further enraged when my girlfriend was properly playing with the bean bags and took her shoes off to better participate in the game.  The manager quickly ran over and asked her to put her shoes on as he would not want her to cut her feet on broken glass.  Perhaps I am in the minority, but I believe it is more of a concern having kids rolling on the floor and aggressively playing then someone taking off their shoes to play a game of bags/corn hole.

My concerns over 'the yard' were confirmed when a friend of mine attended the following weekend.  He is 26 years of age and has a vertical ID.  When he presented his ID he was turned down b/c they do not accept vertical ID's there.  When he asked when that policy was put in place they stated, \"last week.\"  While he was not happy with their decision to deny him service he remained so that his other friends could enjoy their time there.  On of his friends ordered a drink they were pleased with.  They asked him to try it.  He did and the manager quickly came over and rudely said that he would kick them all out if he saw a drink in his hand again.  While my friend and I understand their desire to not allow vertical ID's and be upset that he did try a drink we both believe the aggressive tone and attitude the Manager took was not warranted nor was it justified.  

While I could go on about my disdain for 'the yard' I would rather leave with a few partying words.  The drinks at 'the yard' are excellent, as long as you are ordering a specialty cocktail.  The prices may be high, but I understand that they are attempting to appeal to a higher echelon more pretentious crowd.  The food that we ordered was average at best for the price we paid.  I did not appreciate the school yard atmosphere, this is a bar not a place for children, they should regulate that patronage more closely.  I left unsatisfied and under appreciated.  Ultimately, I will NEVER return to 'the yard' and now find it difficult to enjoy other Fox Restaurant Concept establishments."}
{"text":"Totally laid back, fun environment. Really great food and cocktails, and Erik is by far the best bartender! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was great for dinner with a group of 8 friends. We did wait more that 2 hrs but we drank while we waited in the cocktail area. We didn't play games but it would have been so fun!! Food was just okay, not bad by any means but not blow-your-socks-off good. I would def go again. A little loud for good convo but would be so fun for a few friends."}
{"text":"At first glance, walking inside of The Yard is enchanting. The outdoor game area is unique and we had a lot of fun playing games together this afternoon. 

However, I was not at all impressed with how management handles their restaurant. Our server was amazing, but everybody else we dealt with today was rude/aloof (possibly racist?:-( ). If I'm paying premium prices for fish and chips, I expect friendly service from ALL staff and management. Instead of accommodating a large birthday party (of which they were aware would be present well in advance), we were placed in awkward seating arrangements and scolded by management for moving tables to allow more people to sit together. No suggestions or accommodations were offered, we had to advocate for different seating that would be more suitable for our needs in an *empty* restaurant. If the restaurant had been even remotely busy, I could understand why this might be an issue, but the place was practically deserted. What makes me use the \"R\" word is the fact that another party who had booked in advance had what seemed like very different treatment. Overall the feeling I have about The Yard can be summed up in one word: icky. I get a pit in my stomach thinking about my experience there.  

I expected much, much more from a Fox concept, having been to many of their other restaurants including the sadly defunct Bloom in the Phoenix area. The Yard is not a place I would go back to of my own volition. Dial down the self-importance, align the overall quality of your service to the prices on your menu, and treat all your customers equally. I won't be back unless refusing makes for a socially awkward situation...and then I'm ordering the cheapest thing on the menu and drinking water."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips. Fish was tasteless and overcooked (dark brown). I did like the outside area and the fact that they had games (bean bag toss I think?)."}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out with friends, play some games and have some great food! Great place for big groups or parties. Its a communial area where you have the choice of three different restaurants (coffee shop coming soon!). MUST SEE for the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Nice chill atmosphere, good drink prices, lots of games (ping pong, bean bag toss), warm firepits and heat lamps for the cooler evenings. Great vibe, great energy, would recommend."}
{"text":"I have been to the Yard both for dinner and for brunch, as well as just for drinks.  I should preface this review by saying that I don't really eat a lot of dairy (so why the hell did I go to a grilled cheese place?!) 

Their sandwiches are pretty good.  You can get a grilled cheese with pretty much anything on it, they are hearty, and warm, and pretty delicious.  My friend is OBSESSED with the fried green tomatoes, though i can't personally attest.  You get fries on the side and can get regular, or sweet potato, or Cajun, or old bay (still not 100% sure how this is different from Cajun), I might be missing something--I was a tad disappointed in the sweet potato, but the Cajun were on point. And what is a grilled cheese without tomato soup? Honestly, I really do not like their tomato soup, something about it just doesn't taste right.  

And who doesn't love brunch?  You can get mimosas or do the Bloody Mary bar. It may be wise to make a reservation (especially for more than 4 people) for a brunch, but I have squeezed in with a party if 5. The only time I ordered something than a grilled cheese, I got the chorizo scramble from the brunch menu--it was fine, but though it says \"spicy chorizo\" on the menu, nothing about it is spicy.  

Thus, for food I would probably go with a 3, but the bar is great! They always have a great draft list and I have had a lot of fun talking to some of the bartenders. That being said, the wait staff (though I think some of my favorites are now gone) is also incredible (except the sassy guy I had at brunch last time)."}
{"text":"I was at theYard tonite for a dinner with co workers. 
  I had the Rainbow Trout  it was very good  my wife had the Fried Chicken. Not so good. Nice atmosphere good people working here"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Sunday brunch at the Yard! Wendy took care of us and I ordered the fried chicken with a bacon Bloody Mary. Everything was delicious  my son ordered pasta with butter and apples- he seemed to enjoy everything and was excited to play after finishing his meal. Wendy was very nice and took care of us perfectly :) thank you!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointing. The food was good, somewhat small portions for the price. But the noise was RIDICULOUS. My ears hurt leaving there. Spoiled the whole meal. Couldn't have a conversation. Unless they address this I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great concept and atmosphere, but that is all!  The food at Culinary Dropout is a complete joke for what you pay.  To make matters worse every server there is a hipster trying to make their parents proud by finding a job, making service absolutely dreadful, expect for Colin ( he was great, not even our server).  They claim the place is kid friendly, yet they yell at kids for being kids and are more concerned about their precious ping pong tables then their guests.  Don't even get me started on the fact that you have to valet park which is supposedly free, yet you have to tip= scam.

  I recommend staying away from this place unless you have two hours of your life you never want to get back and that is just waiting for a table.."}
{"text":"Love the pretzels and fondue...love the atmosphere and drinks!


Service is awful. 6 bartenders and sitting at the bar, had to beg for another glass of wine and literally yell to get someone's attention to get our check, seriously? We at AT the bartop."}
{"text":"Every time I go to The Yard I always leave feeling disappointed, but u always want to go back. Their grilled cheeses are really good, but the tomato soup is yicky. Not good at all. I have only been to brunch once, but it was a travesty. Not good. I got eggs and breakfast potatoes and they were thee most bland thing I have ever eaten. They have all of these fancy breakfast dishes when they can't even get basic breakfast right? 

But, their cheesecake is out of this world. I hate plain cheesecake, but The Yard's is excellent."}
{"text":"In theory this place is a fun concept, food, bar, outdoor playground for adults including, lounging areas, large screen tvs, games and servers to bring you whichever cocktail and snacks you desire and the bonus of valet parking.
I came to join friends under a reservation for a birthday party, upon walking in overheard that the wait was at least 2 1/2 hours long, I thought wow this place must be amazing....
Our reserved seating space was LIMITED, but we managed a game of musical chairs, we're adults we know how to share, stand or wander around without getting lost, really not a big deal. 
The food, well if pretzel balls with cheesy fondue and chips is your idea of a meal then you're in luck! I heard they have a great menu although I was never handed one or asked if I wanted one.
Service, well the one server we had for our entire group seemed to be running like a chicken with her head cut off! Too much for even an awesome server to handle & for those who chose to try their luck at the bar the wait was loooonnnggg!
We did manage to entertain ourselves since the place was jam packed, you couldn't hear the football game, barely heard eachother,  game tables were busy or too crowded to really play, there wasn't room or service to order a meal, drinks took so long your buzz faded in between drinks.
As for the bonus of Valet parking, full before 6:30pm, but if you're willing to risk your life as was suggested by parking across the street and dodging busy traffic then this is the place for you! 
P.S. Who came up with the concept of shared his and her bathrooms must have been an only child! Bad idea!!!"}
{"text":"Updated review: Honestly , the bottomless mimosas make this restaurant one of favorites except for today. We arrived at 2pm and ordered an appetizer, beer, and the mimosas. Everything was pretty great at that point. We had the chips and dip with our drinks and watched some really good games on. The restaurant was not overly crowded. A good amount of people were leaving we when arrived.
We ordered our food about 15 after 2. We didn't get our food until 10 til 3, so we were starving and a little upset. We only had 2 people in our party and there were couples who arrived after us that ate and left before we got food lol.
Our server was nice but honestly my boyfriend's monster of dragons was super soggy from where it had been sitting for awhile and it  was just not good. we won't be returning here for a long time after our experience today."}
{"text":"What a fun Place. Great Food, not healthy but delish. Staff is superb, from the hostess, waiters, and manager. We waited a bit for a table, but with 50 different tap items, we had a nice happy hour before getting a table. I took cousins from out of town, and they were totally impressed. all the TVS allow us to almost have our own private TV. When we wanted the Capitals Game on for my cousins, they was no problem ( even in the Burgh) Shout outs to Mike D. and manger Jen. Everyone go and have fun."}
{"text":"If you like grilled cheese sandwiches and you're in the mood for a splurge, The Yard is the place to go! I'm a big fan of their downtown location, so I was excited when they announced they would be opening a new set of doors in the South Hills as well.

I (and my family) have eaten here several times since it opened, and we always love it. Service is good and the food is fantastic! The last time I was here, a friend and I enjoyed a delicious brunch on a busy Sunday. Busy it may have been, but our waiter checked on us often and we were never left wanting. 

My friend ordered the Big Che-Bowski sandwich (which includes two cheeses, over-easy egg, bacon, and tomato) while I ordered the Snozzberry Pancakes (topped with Strawberry & Blueberry syrup and ricotta whipped cream). Both were nothing short of amazing. His sandwich was the kind of messy but appetizing grilled cheese that you savor with every bite, while my three sweet and tasty thick flapjacks had me smiling with every bite. Also, half of the stack had to come home with me, because it was MASSIVE.

Good portions, good service, great food - it's everything I could ask for. That's why I always look forward to visiting The Yard!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese. Cocktails. Great atmosphere, ambiance, and service. How can I not adore The Yard? I got to eat here for the first time a couple days ago, and it was incredible. There were sooooo many tempting things on The Yard's menu - but as great as their flatbreads, appetizers and burgers looked, I knew that I had to get a grilled cheese during my first meal here.

I made the right call! While my dining buddy got a tasty shrooms grilled cheese, I stuffed my face with an incredible fried green tomatoes grilled cheese. (Seriously, where else can you find that combination?) The addition of bacon to the cheesy mix did a lot to help balance out the tangy taste of the green tomatoes - plus, the bacon and green tomatoes together added a nice crunch to the entire sandwich; nothing was overdone by any means, but the texture was perfect given the ingredients involved. Just to top it all off, the entire stack automatically came with a side of thick tomato soup for dipping and eating; that's all the proof I need to know that this place knows their grilled cheese!

And as if coming with the dipping bowl wasn't enough, dining partner and I alike could order another side with our sandwich and soup. While most meals typically come with chips here, there are plenty of substitution options if you're looking for something else. I opted for a super tasty stack of glazed green beans, which were fresh and ever-so-slightly crunchy - a wonderful thing, as many places overcook their green beans to the point of being mushy and \"blah\".

Literally the only thing that could have made our night better was dessert, but alas, we ended up drinking ours before we even finished our main courses, as we tried several different cocktails. Gin drinkers, get on in here and enjoy their gin cocktail. It's incredible. Just sayin'.

I know that I'll be here again soon, especially because they have some fantastic happy hour options that I won't want to miss out on. There's a lot more menu for me to try - food and cocktail alike!"}
{"text":"Not that great and the service was spotty. I know that this place is new, but there were several service issues. The order came out super fast but it was wrong. I had ordered tomato soup and regular fries. I got no soup and chips.  They fixed the chips right away, but never brought me my soup.  After eating the fries, I wished I would have kept the chips. Fries were soggy, oily and limp. I got the Daniel Lafferty grilled cheese which turned out to be not a good combination.  I should have gotten something more traditional.   I will probably give them another chance, but there are better places.  It's also very noisy inside."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a creature of habit so I have been here several times-and am definitely not complaining about that! The Yard rocks. There's great drinks, salty bar apps, and actually delicious food (same menu as culinary dropout). You can also order special cheeses and other little samples, but we've only tried the cheeses once and felt they were superfluous to the meal. That said, the fried chicken we have both tried and it is to die for! Comes with a hot biscuit, mashed potatoes, and my mouth is watering just typing this! They say on the menu that the fried chicken takes longer but \"is worth the wait\" but honestly it doesn't take too long- or there is so much fun to be had here you won't notice! TVs galore for sports-lovers, and an outdoor area with ping-pong tables for sports-players! Pro tip: I would not recommend the \"double blind\" special, which consists of a mystery low-end beer and a shot. My boyfriend did this and while I cannot remember the price, he ended up getting a mediocre beer with a shot of Jim Beam maple that tasted like pure syrup! Of course, you might get luckier...

The bouncer gave me a bit of a hard time about my ID, but that's only because I look something like 5 years younger than my actual age."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has such a nice vibe to it! Definitely a cute restaurant to go to for a night out. The food is really yummy and the prices are average! Also, the live music is great. Overall, good food, service & chill atmosphere!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience, rude bar tenders, inattentive service, messed up my check, not ever coming back"}
{"text":"We worked up a real hunger shopping in the fabulous Clark Building Jewelry shops for sparkly diamonds.  It was fairly early (around 2PM) so we didn't want a heavy meal.  The Yard seemed to fit the bit so we headed on up to the second floor above Yovi's Hotdog place.  It was surprisingly crowded with lots of families.  That is great to see in downtown Pittsburgh on a bleary cold February afternoon.  In the not so distant past, downtown was a ghost town on weekends except for sports and Cultural District patrons.  Hurrah for the turnaround!

We have tried the Yard a few times for their awesome selection of draft beers and decent happy hour music selection but it had been a while since we actually ate there.  The menu is mostly bar food highlighted by a page full of variations on the grilled cheese theme.  I like their grilled cheeses but then, I'm a real Texas Toast lover so that's not a surprise.

I tried out the Yard Walker sandwich with chicken, bacon, cheddar, and garlic aioli with lettuce and tomato and red onion on a brioche bun. It was just okay, not great but not horrible either.  I think it needed seasoning like salt and pepper or something because it was a little bland, to be honest.  

For a side, I substituted fresh cut thin sliced French fries with parmesan cheese sprinkled on them and herbs.  They were supposed to be garlic parm but I detected very little garlic.  They were fresh and slightly crispy and the right portion.  My gf ordered the poutine fries that come with gravy, cheese curds, short ribs, and beer cheese.  They came in a metal bowl and were essentially a HUGE LIMP GLOB of melted cheese and fries. They were sort of bland too.  Disappointing and not even good the next day. 

Our server was excellent!  The price was $35 for two of us without any beer (just tea and water).  I think it's a great spot to hang out after work or before a ballgame but not really my first choice for food."}
{"text":"The menu is unique and interesting! Not to mention delicious! Our server Michael was excellent. He was entertaining and very knowledgable about the menu. The food looked as delicious as it sounds on the menu."}
{"text":"The menu options are solid, and definitely a good spot for casual group events or when You really really want a gourmet grill cheese and a beer. There are a few things to level-set expectations with though.

1. I wish there were options for the type of bread used in the grill cheeses. They use texas toast for all of the grill cheeses, even though they stock other breads for burgers and sandwiches. I'm not a huge fan of texas toast and would've much rathered a heartier, actual bread (multi-grain maybe?) than something so white and processed that it's hardly worth eating. If they already have the different breads in the kitchen, why not use it for grill cheeses?

2. The \"tomato soup\" that comes with the grill cheese I swear is just marinara sauce. It isn't bad, but come on, if you're going to serve a sauce then say so. When the menu says \"tomato soup\" I actually expect something like soup, not thick like red sauce."}
{"text":"This place can be fun if there's not a huge crowd hogging all the sitting areas and equipment. Good luck on a Friday or Saturday...I came back on a Sunday night and the place was wide open. Happy hour beer mugs sound good at $3, but it's not on all draft selections and the \"mugs\" are pretty small."}
{"text":"Not to be a Debby downer but it's 2018 and there are different people in the world who eat more than just pork. So, as a vegetarian this is definitely not a place to be. Perhaps people need to learn that being a vegetarian doesn't mean we only eat salad and bread? Anyway, I guess coming here again will not be on my future to-do's. Came here with a group of coworkers because that was the place they picked, I thought I could order from one of the places that's around and just eat here but unfortunately the place was closed. I got nachos with no meat which translates to tortilla chips with smudged cheese on them with three beans and a spoonful of pico (no salsa here). Spend your money somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"We had 30 people  for after tax season party.  Valet was much better they had 4 person instead  of one . They kept  the drinks  flowing.  However  the food was a little  slow. Waiters were a little  confused but very friendly.  Their deserts were fantastic. Love their  fried chicken  and french  dip. Best in town.  Originally  had problems  with the manager  but got it resolved"}
{"text":"They were fantastic! Read my opentable note about celebrating 2 birthdays, and they discreetly brought out a dessert with candles for the birthday boy and girl. Food was delicious, staff was great, drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"Great fun place, good service, excellent people watching. ... . Menu selection is poor."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about The Yard. So had our family dinner date there...never again. Ordered the fish and chips healthy portion not, we received over cooked fish. The Sweet corn ravioli again for the price not worth it. 
Looked over at the cooking station and thought whoever ordered the nacho cheese I feel bad for them. The tortillas burnt and it was two platters. YIKES...The chef must have had a bad day."}
{"text":"Sam Fox restaurant.  Its the combo of a play-yard (ping pong and cornhole - no not that kind) and drinks, sometimes a band, and good peeps.  Good place to go hang out.  Fun lively atmosphere, etc.  Parking you should plan on valet due to good size crowds (even on sunday).  I cannot comment on the food much as I have only had a few appetizers, which were good."}
{"text":"What a huge space to view hipsters in their wrought iron and tequila habitat.  Decent food and a comfortable space.  I think Fox took my fellow yelpers reviews to heart.  The service was prompt and friendly and the ceiling fans cooled off a hot Phoenix afternoon.  Complimentary valet solved the parking hassle.   Tip- turn on montebello for a quick left into the valet line."}
{"text":"Cool place! 

I am a fan of The Yard. The environment is open and fun. I usually frequent the middle bar or culinary dropout. Service has always been pretty good and the food comes out promptly and on point. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Well I'm back because I've been to 2 different places and have been unable to find a decent burger on a menu.  This place has one on the menu for a reasonable cost, and didn't tell me they were out of them.  Listen I don't eat burgers that often, is ther some sort of crisis in Pittsburgh?  All I want is a good burger.  This place fit the bill."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink and play some games. A bit chaotic but if you go in prepared for that it will been fun place to hangout with some friends"}
{"text":"Hearing about hot spots in phoenix and how fun it is always intrigues me and when I'm in town I always want to visit them. So when trying to figure out a place to meet my ladies for a drink, the yard was thrown out and I quickly agreed. Even though it was almost a 45 min drive for me I wanted to see what all the hype was about. 

My first impression was a little less favorable since I spent about 25 min trying to park. As most of you have read on other reviews valet IS the only parking option. There are residential side streets but you need a permit to park. You at park on the other side of 7th street and risk running across the street since the closest cross walk is about 1/2 mile down the street. Even valet is super busy so if you are lucky enough to get there before it fills up, you will still sit and wait for a good 5-10 min. 

So you finally park and get to the entrance to see a hostess stand and three different restaurants. They ask you where you would like to sit and I say \"umm, the yard?\" Then the snotty little hostess replies with \"this whole place is the yard\". Well excuse me Lil miss priss I'm not from here and this is my first time here. So when you goggle AND yelp \"the yard\" this place shows up, there really is not any signification that its comprised of three restaurants. Ok so moving on I finally am seated with my party inside CULINARY DROPOUT and we are greeted by out server.  

From this point on the service was pretty good. Our server was attentive and friendly. Nothing too spectacular about their food, but it was good. I had the seared ahi salad. I did like the way you could pick your cheese and meats as a starter. We did enjoy the monkey bread for dessert and I have to admit, that was yummy!

Overall, if the 3 stars is for the service, other than that the overall experience was maybe a 1. Sad too because I've heard so many good things."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and it's always been good. But tonight I had the Yard Burger and it was REALLY great. The burger was cooked lovely (I put medium instead of medium rare like I usually do since my friend who got this last time had a soggy burger). I loved everything about the burger, though. The aioli sauce was tasty and I loved the crunchy onions and even the bacon which I usually omit from a burger. Just wanted to try it this time. I will definitely order this again. I also love their homemade chips!"}
{"text":"Very good gastropub in the Mt. Lebanon Galleria. There is a very large selection of prime quality craft beers. If you are a craft beer connoisseur, this place is a must. 

If you come during happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 all craft beer drafts are half off. This is the same discount you get at Primanti Bros across the street, but The Yard has a better selection. 

There's a beer listed projected in the wall and also a paper list they can give you that organizes the beers by type and gives details of the ingredients and ABV. 

The food is also very good and kind of unique with the grilled cheese specialty sandwiches. I really liked the Cheesy Capresey. It had various cheeses but the taste of the balsamic vinegar was prominent. Very interesting combination, and not overly cheesy. The tomato soup is a good accompaniment. The homemade chips were good but did not come straight out of the fryer--I thing they may have been sitting out. 

The setting and layout is also excellent. You're at the top of the mall and as you sit at the bar you can see across the whole atrium and out the windows of the Galleria. It had a very open and spacious feel. The bar in the middle of the restaurant is large with a lot of seats and there are lots of tables spread out. Lots of screens around too and a good place if a game is on. 

This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really nice beer selection (can also do flights of 3), and the grilled cheese options are good (I'd recommend smack yo mama, with bbq chicken and onion straws or the big chebowski, with fried egg and bacon). 

Grilled cheeses come with tomato soup and fries. The soup's not bad, but the past two times I've been (fall 2015 and winter 2016),  the fries have been terrible -- soggy and looking as if they've been sitting out for hours. It was a busy, and fairly reasonable time to go, so I'm puzzled why they were this bad. That said, the sandwiches are really tasty, and the beer's great."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this. I loved the feel. I was there for a group gathering and it was well set up for getting up and moving around to mingle. Lots of sports fans nearby and it is good for cheering on your favorite team as well. 

Mostly ate pretzel bites and the cheese was a little Velveeta-ish. I would probably stick with drinks if I was to return."}
{"text":"It pains me to poorly review a Sam Fox restaurant, because usually I'm a big fan. However, my experience at this particular location was pretty horrible.
First of all, do not come here with any expectations of grandeur. Although it no longer resembles the motorcycle shop that it once was, and has been spruced up with string lights, trendy furniture and nice landscaping, this place still has a bit of a grungy, rock-n-roll feel. Not what I was looking for. Also, do not expect to beat the rush by going on a Wednesday night. We went on a random Wednesday in March and had to wait for AN HOUR. Granted, we could have made reservations, but I didn't think it would be necessary. It was not the most fun when it is your anniversary and you wore your nicest dress and there is nowhere to sit and wait except for picnic tables and adirondack chairs RIGHT next to the cornhole toss. As in, you can feel the bean bags ruffling your skirt as they whizz by.  Not my idea of a romantic night out. I obviously chose the wrong place. The vibe isn't helped when there are kids everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I'm a teacher, I love kids, just not when I am out on the town.
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods. One thing I will say is that the Pretzel Bite appetizer cheered me right up. Those pretzels are DELICIOUS when dipped into a pot of silky provolone cheese. However, they have this same appetizer at Arrogant Butcher, and this was the only positive on a menu that otherwise is completely unimpressive. Salad with ranch dressing? Yesterday's soup? Meatloaf? Beef stroganoff with frozen peas? Come on. You guys can do better than that.  I got the grilled cheese slider with tomato and bacon and they used AMERICAN CHEESE. At least, I'm pretty sure.  Also, the tomato was bland and the bacon was undercooked. So disappointing. I didn't even finish my meal.
I will not be returning here, even after they add more restaurants. If anything, that will just make this place more hectic and overcrowded."}
{"text":"I went out for late night on Friday. First time here to try. My sever was the best she really helpful and friendly. I got shrimp wrap and wonderful dessert."}
{"text":"Too many kids to enjoy it (unless of course you go there to take your kids).  I'm sure it changes as the evening gets later.  I love kids, I have 2 myself.  But I don't hire a babysitter to go out for a drink just so that someone else's toddlers can be hanging over their shoulder drooling on me."}
{"text":"Fun place, nice outside areas, surprisingly cool outside due to fans, misters, lots going on here. several different restaurants to choose from. We chose Culinary Dropout. Happy hour menu was what we went with otherwise I would say overpriced food but you are paying for atmosphere. Comfort food but some healthy choices too. Kale chopped salad was delish."}
{"text":"Visited the yard this past weekend with a group of ten. We sat outside of culinary dropout and had a nice little table with a fire. Loved the atmosphere and the appetizers we ordered were all great. However, two orders of food were completely forgotten and brought almost an hour after ordering. Towards the end of the night when we were ready to close out and leave we realized our server hadn't been back to check on us in about 30 mins. At this point the outside area was no longer busy and it seemed odd. We asked the bar tenders for help and they said there was nothing they could do. It took a total of 45 mins to close our tabs. When she returned she looked extremely frustrated that we had asked for her and never apologized for the wait."}
{"text":"This place is good for a group because you can eat and play games. If you don't like to be in crowded place with tons of people that night get rowdy then do not go here on the weekends. I mean c'mon! The food is great and so was our server. He was attentive and personable especially for us being there on a Friday night at peak hrs. He came and  checked on water multiple times and to just check on our group of 8. He also recommended a really good beer, if I had a star I'd give it to him! Haha 

Overall: good Friday night, great ambience, great service, great food, social, fun 

Con:I did see some poor sucker throw up the corner and drag it all over the floor but they were quick to clean it up, they close wayyyy too early and would make more money staying open later!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and I love the crab cake grilled cheese. Great place for kids and the staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Yay!! I am so so happy that The Yard is at the galleria!! The amazing location at the very top floor of the galleria has been the same restaurant for years and than was most recently vacant. I could not think of a better addition to The Galleria than The Yard. 

I have also visited both locations in Shady Side & Market Square and had a great experience at those locations as well. Most recently, I came here for a Sunday brunch to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday with my parents. My mom suggested making reservations- which surprised me.. but good thing we did! We had our reservations for 11:00 AM and the place was packed shortly after! I had the \"basically bottomless\" mimosas as my drink and Chris and my dad ordered the bloody Mary's- which they both agreed on being delicious. 

Although we came here for brunch.. I can't come to The Yard and NOT order a grilled cheese. If you know me.. grilled cheese is one of my favorite foods. After much consideration, I decided on the Fried Green Tomatoes sandwich. This was served with homemade chips- and I got the garlic parmesan flavor on top. Everything was amazing! My mom also ordered a grilled cheese but stuck with the Simple Jack (boring!). Chris and my dad opted for breakfast foods- the Brun-Cho's Bro and Short Rib Delight. Both agreed that they were great meals- but almost a little too hearty! I see myself coming back to The Yard many times in the future!"}
{"text":"As with so many of the Fox Restaurants, I'm conflicted.  I love the concepts, the quirkiness, and the neighborhood feel.  But so often there are things that can be improved.  Some of the criticism I level at this place might be unfair as its beyond their control, but there are some areas for which they can make a difference.  

Allow me to set the stage.  My brother and I came for lunch today (he'd been here, but I hadn't).  The place was really dead (\"shockingly dead\" as my brother described).  The PF Chang's Marathon was going on so I suspect would be customers decided to avoid the potential traffic near the marathon route.  Good for us I guess as we almost had a run of the place.  The restaurant is actually a densely packed collective of restaurants that all used to be a motorcycle sales, service, and showroom area.  Now there are three distinct restaurants dotting the old footprint.  Culinary Dropout/The Yard, Little Cleo's, and soon Lola Coffee.  Having seen the size of the parking lot, I have no idea they're able to get people in and out of the area when its full as the collective of restaurants can probably seat well over 300 people, but there's only parking for about 50 cars.  Thank goodness it was dead.

The Yard is essentially the outdoor seating space for Culinary Dropout and the menu is the same for both.  The menu contained a number of items I've had at other Fox Restaurants including pretzels & cheese I've had at Arrogant Butcher and a bacon burger I've had at Zinburger.  Since I was in the mood for both, I got both.  Both were as good as I remember.  Would've liked to try something new and innovative, but the menu didn't have all that much that excited me.  My brother got essentially the same thing and we both got a beer each.  Total tab for two burgers, two beers, and the pretzel appetizer was about $60 including tip.  A bit pricey for what you get, but that's more or less what I expect with Fox restaurants.  Afterwards my brother and I played a game of ping pong in back.  Would've played corn hole toss, but ran out of time.  

Overall, the food was adequate but didn't wow me.  The Yard space is a very cool concept with great shading, plenty of TVs, comfortable seating, and games like corn hole toss and ping pong in back.  And I love the adaptive reuse of the buildings to give the area new life.  

That said, I can understand how this area could be overwhelming to some Yelpers when the place is packed.  While the young to middle aged adults are the primary target audience for Fox restaurants, what little crowd their was today was predominantly parents with their toddlers.  I suspect most nights The Yard is probably full of kids more than adults.  Cool I guess if that's what you're looking for, but potentially a turnoff for others.  And as with most Fox restaurants, the food is overpriced.  I get that you pay for the atmosphere as much as the food, but I'm all about the value of the food as much as the atmosphere.

I would come here again if asked, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place..really. In their defense, the patio is super cool- although very noisy and it wasn't full. Plenty of seating between couches and tables..love that part. The food was very disappointing. The service wasn't great either. We overlooked the fact that our server got the drink order wrong..arrived with ice instead of straight up..martini didn't just have a \" light splash\" of olive juice but was down right dirty. Ok, no problem. The burrata appetizer that the server talked up was lacking in the complex flavor that the menu promised. Still ok, looking forward to entree. I had the trout with a side of French fries to satisfy my rarely indulged carb craving. The fries were so soggy I sent them back and the trout was swimming in butter. My sweetie also threw caution to the wind, ordering fried chicken ( the menu said it would be worth the wait). It was so over cooked- very dark brown and the meat so dry it wasn't all edible. Our server disappeared often, had to be asked 3x for a black napkin and forks..and we were pressed for time because of theatre tickets so didn't wait for a second shot at the chicken. Don't want to be a hater but I'd return if all I wanted was a drink..like a beer or glass of wine but I wouldn't go there hungry. Burgers looked decent but I noticed the table next to us..8 sandwich and burger people and a lot of food went back :("}
{"text":"My son and I went to The Yard, on a Friday morning, the weekend of the Yard Sale.  We were there right when it opened, so one would have expected good service, since staff was bright eyed and bushy tailed. Right? 

(Sigh)

Our waitress was clearly distracted. By what I am not sure. I ordered the black mussels. My son had the biscuits and gravy. Our food arrived and was devoured, but we did not get an offer for a refill on our lemonade. And where was our waitress? We waited and waited for the check to arrive, and then we waited and waited for her to come back and pick up the check and payment. 

There had to be no less than 20 people in the entire place (not counting the Mexican food place).

There were several booths from different companies for our enjoyment to shop at for their Yard Sale weekend, which was fun.

I'd like to go again and maybe sit at the bar? It seemed like that would be a better place to eat, drink and have the attention of the server for refills."}
{"text":"I love this funky fun place. The menu has a wonderful variety--their fried chicken, meatloaf and even their Cheap House salad and soups are great. I also love their mussels. If you have children, there is a great kids menu and enough stimulation to keep them busy. Tourists and visitors love this place where you have three restaurants under the same roof--Barrio Cafe, Little Cleos and Culinary Dropout.  Fun, fun, fun."}
{"text":"Great gourmet grilled cheese and extensive craft beers on tap. Quickly seated and food came out fairly fast."}
{"text":"We've been here (and the other Yards) a few times and have  noticed a steady decline in quality. Last night, we ordered the steak salad minus the steak (don't eat meat) and the caprese salad. Both had some limp lifeless lettuce, the \"steak\" salad had a dry old egg. I asked for a piece of bread and was brought a piece of dry \"Texas toast\" with early mold on the crust. The check comes.....hey.....maybe knock off a buck or two for forgoing the meat. Plus....a two dollar charge for the moldy bread. With a $10.00 tip for the ditzy server, it was a $50.00 hour for $1.39 worth of lousy food. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We went here last night for a friends birthday and had tons of fun! We were sat outside which was covered with tons of fans so even though it was 90 something degrees it felt a lot cooler. The atmosphere is awesome and the waitress we had did a great job. The food was also good. We had pretzels to start with yummy cheese fondue and then split a turkey pastrami sandwich with fries and it was all delish. The only issue was how packed it was we were never able to play any of the games they had outside but other than that we had a great evening. Drinks were really good too!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place... 

Love: 
1. Drinking + Games = Yes please! 
2. Grilled Cheese sliders :)
3. Happy Hour

Hate: 
1. Getting a table takes an act of God
2. Getting a drink without a table... even worse 
3. No parking.  Valet is pretty much your only option, if its not full... then you're SOL.  

My advice, get there early (Like before 2PM) and stake your claim at a table near the games.  Its the only way to truly enjoy the Yard."}
{"text":"First let me say, I love the CONCEPT of this place.  However, the delivery on a pleasant evening falls short because of staff and some logistical problems that seriously need to be ironed out by management.  We recently went there and had an decent dinner at culinary dropout, the bill, with tip, was over $400. 

We proceeded to The Yard, and after many attempts to get ping pong paddles were successful.  You are required to give a driver's license to obtain paddles and a ball, I get that some collateral is necessary....however, a license should not be held ransom.  Let me explain:  Getting drinks here takes FOREVER, there is NO service in the game area so a huge bottle neck develops at the exterior bar, getting a round of drinks can take up to 30 minutes.  We were in between ping pong games when the table next to us lost their ball, they asked to borrows ours and in the spirit of being a normal human being, shared the 20 cent ball.  We decided to switch games, brought the paddles back to the host.. The manager refused to give a driver's license back until the 20 cent ball was returned. 

FIRST, I wonder if it is even LEGAL to hold someone's government issued ID?
 
SECOND, I can not imagine this is the first ping pong ball ever misplaced.  

THIRD, the bouncer flew off the handle IMMEDIATELY when our group member said \"Fine, I, a paying patron, will go take the ping pong ball away from another paying patron, but let me hold the paddles ransom since you are holding my license ransom.\"  (really that seems fair, right?).  

There was clearly no regard for customer service or staff training, the situation escalated so quickly and the security guard was so aggressive towards our group of 8 ( 3 women, 5 men -- all parents of young children, well behaved grown ups) He actually tried to chest bump my husband as he violently ripped a full beer out of his hand.  It was so confusing that this was happening over a ping pong ball. 

The take away here is that the concept is great, the food is pretty good but you will be treated horribly here.  POSSIBLY THE WORST SERVICE IN THE VALLEY."}
{"text":"I tried - note: tried - to celebrate my birthday here. I had reservations and everything. Not once did anyone tell me my party had to be there all at once to be seated. The trouble is, & I told the person making my reservation, that I would be having approximately 40 people coming and going throughout the night so I can never say that my entire party would be there together. One manager tried to work with me, while the other manager came right behind him and undid the other guy's suggestions or solutions. It was my party and I cried, and not because I wanted to. It was awful. 

They split up the tables that we waiting for me with my name on the signs and gave it to a 6 top. They said that the couple of us that had already arrived could share a 4-top table. Really? Awe thanks that was so generous. Then they actually suggested we hover over people in the outdoor seating areas and when they leave - we swoop their seats. Man! Why didn't I think of that? I love being rude and all up in people's personal space. 

It was really unfortunate because I love Fox Restaurants but I have a very bitter taste in my mouth for this one ... 

It's such a cool concept. Too bad they don't have their shit together."}
{"text":"Cute place. Fun atmosphere. I had the MAC Burger. Which is their version of the Big MAC. Obviously much better though. The fries were fantastic! There was some trouble trying to make reservations for our large party. We ended up just showing up and waiting to grab a table. Other then that, It was a good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Even in the heat of the summer, there are misters and a roof structure which keeps it manageable in the summer. Fun games like ping pong and corn hole, but they are first come first serve so make sure you see the hostess to reserve the equipment. culinary Dropout offers great appetizers and drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere; it's unique and energetic. Decor is great, especially \"outside\".
Service was bad... Our waitress was MIA most of the evening. Ended up going to bar for self service, also filling up our own water glasses. By the way, bartender was slow to wait on us and was not very friendly.
Food-- just ok. Had pretzel with cheese fondue, which was good but pretzels had too much salt on them. Also had a burger which was decent, nothing to write home about.
If management would work on improving service we would make this a regular stop despite food being average, since it has such a good vibe. Not sure whether it's worth the price unless at least the service steps things up."}
{"text":"What a MOSTLY LOVE/hate relationship I have with this place. I really love what they are doing here. I would love to see more of it around the Valley. The concept that I can place games in a beautiful environment with a drink in my hand and a cool chair to sit in when I'm ready to rest and have a bite... awesome... But it's also most everyone else's dream as well. And man does it get crazy in here. This place is the best when you can get there a little early with the right group of friends and you can pretty much play any game you want at any given time. I really do think this place is beautiful. I love the greenery surrounding you and the lights strung all over from above. The cute little pockets of unique chairs, couches, and tables. They even have one of those photo booths where all you and your friends can go look really ridiculous in the middle of everyone and take fun photo's to remember your night by. It's just an all-around great place if you come here just a little before peak hours. After about 8:00pm on a weekend, your screwed. Games are taken or being hogged and you are trying to fight to find a table. I think it's great that they have so much business, but I'm out once I can't help but brush up against someone to get by. 

Culinary Drop Out**The Yard's Food & Bar Attached** is not my favorite. It's nothing special if you ask me. Pretty typical bar food. I tried most of the menu and never thought to myself \"Man... I need to come back here a get this again!\" 

The drinks are pretty dang yummy I do have to say! I love that they have a bunch of different \"Mules.\" to choose from. They have a great selection of beer. I'm a fan of the beer in a paper bag. I think it's kind of fun and funny to get a cheap beer in a bag. I usually don't stick to that all night but I might start with it. The staff is pretty great. They are very busy but get you what you need. I don't know how they remember the things they do. I have to give respect for all of that. My favorite bartender/server is Britta. It's like she can see inside your brain. She's great! Just look for the girl with the lavender/purple hair. She rocks!!

So come here with some fun friends and a competitive spirit and you will have tons of fun. Come here to chill out and relax, you best stay in Culinary Drop Out and get a table."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fun lunch at The Yard today. Surprised with their tomato soup,tasty.  Excellent service by Rafeal, timely delivery of food. Would return."}
{"text":"My third time at the yard. 

First with the Caesar salad. The croutons need to go. They're too much for that little salad also super heavy on the parm. Tomato soup was good. 

Fiance got the poppin my collar shrimp sandwich. It came with 4 small shrimp and 1/4 stick of cream cheese slabbed right in the middle. On two 1\" pieces of Texas toast. Too creamy. 

I got the always sunny steak sandwich which was close to great. The onions peppers and cheese were perfect. Absolutely perfect. However the flat iron steak was unseasoned and tough to bite off. Described on the menu like a Philly cheese I would expect it chopped or sliced. For 14 bucks the steak should get cooked to order. 

Unless they can sub the Texas toast for a thinner ciabatta or softer brioche I would avoid the back side of the menu."}
{"text":"Great service from all and a really fun atmosphere. Honestly we came to play ping pong and enjoy a few drinks but decided to order dinner. I sampled the shaved prime rib dip sandwich that a friend ordered, it was very nice with perfectly rosey prime rib. I loved my pub burger and fries. Fries were hot, crispy and flavorful and my burger was one of the best I've had. Next time we go to the valley we know where we'll eat."}
{"text":"First time there.  Just after lunch rush and I sit at the bar joining three others.  Bartender asks if I'll be eating and I say yes.  Order a beer, he drops off a menu and the beer and moves down the bar to talk with a customer.  Three other bartenders walk back and forth past me.  Tick, tock.  I'm almost  finished with my beer and he finally tears himself away from his friend and asks if I want to order.  I decline, pay my bill.
Not sure how the valet thingy works here, so I wait in line.  Two valets for incoming and outgoing in what appears to be a fairly large parking lot.  I look at my watch and nine minutes later I get my car.  Really?
If you want to spend more time waiting than eating and drinking, go for it.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to The Yard a few times for drinks and dinner and it's always been decent. I finally went for brunch and it was amazing! Brunch alone would be 5 stars. The bottomless mimosas are great, so be sure to go for it! We had French toast, pancakes, and the chicken and waffles at the table and all were really good."}
{"text":"UPDATE: We went back here after a week, much better experience, no soup spilled and they had beer! The manager (Wayne) remembered me from the previous visit and asked about the soup, so that was a good start. I had the Jerk grilled cheese this time, it was advertised as spicy, so I was a little worried, but there wasn't much heat to it at all. I didn't like the fact that the pork was hot and the pineapple was cold. It would have made a huge difference if they heated up the pineapple prior to putting it on the sandwich, but it was good. Big beer selection, good food and good service. The below review was from my first trip, read if you dare!

Don't cry over spilled soup? 

We went out to this new location in Market Square on the day that they opened around 11:30. Immediate disappointment ensued when they weren't able to sell alcohol yet (we were told they would have their liquor license straightened out by 4 for happy hour). We don't need alcohol to have a good time, but they had the 36 draft system right in front of us, so it was just a big tease! 

Anyway, the menu had some very interesting names on it for the grilled cheese sandwiches. I went with the smack yo mama, a grilled cheese with caribbean chicken and jack cheese. After waiting a little while, the food arrived....but as it arrived, the server spilled a whole cup of their tomato soup all over my jeans/shoes. Their serving plates were just wooden rectangles with handles - no lips or indentations for the soup or chip cups to stay on the board - I don't blame the server, I blame the one who settled on these as a good idea to serve hot soup on. I was less than amused, but the manager came over and said he would comp my meal - which ended up being fine since the soup came out!

What gets better (or worse) - the one bartender poured a bottled beer (Evil Genius - Evil Eye PA) into a glass, gave it to the manager who served it to a gentleman at a different table. I asked if we were able to purchase bottles, was told no, then asked why they served a bottle him. They told me the bottle was for the cook to make their beer cheese out of. We could clearly see the gentleman at the table drinking the beer and the bartender denied ever opening it. Don't know why he could have one but nobody else could, but it doesn't look good as a business for you to do that in front of customers and it's even worse if it's illegal for you to do that.

Long story short - this was just not a good lunch, the service was great from the bartender and I do feel bad for the server, but it was just not a good experience. Maybe give this place some time for them to sort out the kinks and I'll edit this review."}
{"text":"Lettuce with feta and some raw pita bread cut up on the side does not a fatoosh make!! Shouldn't have on the menu if you don't actually know what it is or how to make it. Server was super nice though even as he was short handed running around with broken AC by himself. Nice beer flight selection the husband enjoyed."}
{"text":"Had an event at the Yard this past week. Not impressed and wouldn't hold an event again - The Yard is great for casual hangout with a few friends but not an event with 90 people. Food was delivered slowly, service was just ok, though Kendra was fantastic. \"The special events manager\" was a bit stand offish and didn't seem flexible. All in we spent 5700 plus drinks in 2 hours and didn't seem worth it. Disappointed..."}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint!!!! Will absolutely be back again. We came knowing there would be a wait. It was a 45 minute wait, we added our names and they sent us a text to confirm we were on the list. We watched the time and walked around the galleria and got drinks elsewhere while waiting because the yards bar was packed and we couldn't even squeeze in to grab a drink to wait with. They should have an opening at the ends atleast for people to walk up and order a drink. 

Shortly before our table was ready we headed to the yard and waited about 5 minutes. There is almost no seating in the waiting area. They should find a new place for the high chairs and add more seating in the waiting area. The bench barely fit 4 people on it. They called our name and we never got a text saying our table was ready, weird. 

We were seated at a high top table near the bar. This was ok, but those tables have NO ROOM AT ALL. We could barely put a single thing on the table. I would have rather a slightly larger table so I was more comfortable. 

The service was good and pretty quick. We each got ipa beers which were good, nothing crazy to rave about. 

The menu is big! We were nervous we wouldn't be filled from a grilled cheese. We were so wrong! Very happy to say we were so stuffed, we absolutely slipped in to food comas after eating. I got the buffy the Mac attack slayer. This was a grilled cheese with Mac and buffalo chicken. It was so good! Can't wait to go back and order that same one again! I opted out of the chips that are included because I heard they're greasy and got the fries. They seem to be fresh cut fries. They were great!! You also get tomato soup with your meal. It was perfect for dipping your sandwich and fries in! It is thick and more like a tomato paste (which I normally hate, but it was very good)!! My fiancé got the wac Arnold. It is almost like a Big Mac. The description is very deceiving though. They state it has two beef patties on it. You'd expect it to be a double stacked patty sandwich. It was not. It had two tiny little patties side by side. Very odd and he would have rather a stacked double patty sandwich. He said it was still very good and that he was full. 

Overall, great place and packed! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, we just had drinks at the bar. Peach sangria was very good! We had shots, mixed drinks, frilly drinks, and drinks on the rocks! Our bartender was awesome! He also works at the other location and recognized our friends from the other location. He was very friendly, talkative, and made the atmosphere even better! Place was very busy, fast service and not too loud either. Would recommend, will be back again!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun, great place to have fun with friends or coworkers after a long week.  Food is good but pricy, plenty of entertainment and games.  Best to carpool if possible tho. They have valet, but very limited parking for the size of the place"}
{"text":"Very cool location. They have games to play, indoor and covered outdoor seating. Great place to come with friends, hang out and unwind."}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised by this place! I had no idea Pittsburgh had a gourmet grilled cheese spot. They have quite the variety and even two vegetarian options. Our server handled a table of 12 with accuracy and speed. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The Yard is outstanding in  SoCal. The Galleria location in Pittsburgh is a bust. Came for lunch, out of Yard burgers at 12 Noon?? Every other menu at lunch is aGrilled Cheese on Texas Toast.
I was told by the waiter The Yard menu is completely different all ver the country. This menu is designed for Pittsburgh.
After drinking our beers, the waiter miraculously reported they now have Yard burgers? 
Don't bother...chain restaurant FAIL"}
{"text":"Went with co-workers for dinner and drinks, greeter was very friendly and gave us different options for our seating.  We chose to sit outside and enjoy the open feeling and weather.  We ordered multiple appetizers and drinks, everything was great including our service all night.

Great spot for a date night or to hang out with co-workers and friends."}
{"text":"Food is pretty disappointing at this Culinary Dropout. Got a burger and it was so charred it was hard to eat. And I like smokey foods! Also, I think I may have been served rancid bacon. My boyfriend tried it first and reported it had a chemical taste. I took a bite and the meat tasted just like bacon smells when it's been defrosted/open in the fridge a bit too long...Wasn't too upset as I didn't want the bacon on my burger anyway. 

When I mentioned it to the server he made a strange joke that it was lucky that the bacon had been served to someone who wasn't planning to eat it, and that maybe I had saved someone else from food poisoning. I used to work as a server and I definitely wasn't trying to make a big fuss...but I found that response a bit disconcerting. I worry that my comment wasn't taken seriously and that bacon may have been served to others as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet up with friends.  They do a great job of keeping the climate livable outdoors.  You can play corn hole (but get there VERY early - people go and check out the bean bags then sit on them for hours- frustrating that no one is playing it but yet all the bags are checked out). Getting paddles for ping pong isn't too tough though.   

The food is good (all from the Culinary Dropout) - l LOVE this pretzel dish, you get a fondue pot of cheese with these yummy soft pretzel balls (highly recommend). 

I love to take my older kids (teens) before the evening crowd - only downside is now they have to have parents right beside them just to play corn hole (at 2:00 in the afternoon this seems kinda silly to escort my 18 y/o son to play corn hole).  They have to be 21 to be unaccompanied 

But especially if everyone is over 21, it is a fantastic venue and really a fun place to be - a great addition to the North Central Phoenix scene!  But expect that it is super crowded and loud if you are going to go at prime times because it is a very popular place to be.  If you don't like crowds- go early"}
{"text":"A great place to spend time in Central Phoenix. We've always been well taken care of, the food we have ordered was good and the atmosphere is great! Fun, fun, fun! Great mix of people and your choice of different eateries once you're in. Now, we don't come here just for the food, but eventually you work up an appetite and there is plenty to choose from, and we've never been disappointed. When you're there, a ping pong match is always in order! You've got to go!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept, but still needs some kinks worked out!  I don't like having to wait in a roped off line to get a drink at only one bar!  There are tons of people waiting for tables too when most of the tables were actually empty.  I guess they are trying to build exclusivity.  

I'll be back when the seafood joint opens and hope it won't be so chaotic.  Again, cool concept, great drinks and food with a good location!"}
{"text":"We recently visited the Yard for Happy Hour with some friends. We brought along our little guy because we thought he would have a good time hanging around the Yard! He sure did...I'm laughing at the reviews that tell us parents to leave the kiddos at home! We actually went on a Tuesday night, so it was not overcrowded at all. We ordered off the happy hour menu: pretzel fondu, daily chopped salad (kale and sweet potato), meat board, grilled cheese sliders, salmon bruschetta and French fries.  Everything was good off the HH menu, but not healthy. We also ordered a Caesar salad with shrimp. I would go back there just to eat that salad again as I thought it was exceptionally great."}
{"text":"How was it? I don't know! Parking was a mess the Friday afternoon we tried to experience this place for the first time. Parking attendants weren't of much help stating that they had no more spots available.  We'll be shure to try another time - stay tune! Cheers***"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a BUSY Friday night and surprisingly found two spots at the bar. Place was booming w business! I ordered the El Matador and my buddy ordered some sort of IPA. Erik, our bartender was hilarious and took great care of us. Food was GREAT! We had the mussels for appetizer, bistro steak and Italian chop for main course. Manager Hank checked in on us and we really enjoyed him. Played some games out in the yard area and had a couple of shots while at the bar that is outside. Had a great time! Place is amazing from the food to the ambiance to the service. If ever in the area or want to meet for drinks with friends this is the perfect place! Can't wait to bring my family from out of town!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food was amazing and the atmosphere makes it a great place to hangout. I would recommend the pretzel balls. 5 stars for The Yard."}
{"text":"Great place, great environment, great food! Would definitely go back if I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"If you are part of the pizza, pierogi, and hoagie crowd you will like this place.  Attractively decorated with the trending wood paneled wall with globe light decor, it has a nice beer selection.  This restaurant specializes in unique grilled cheese - I suppose it is an extension of the mac n cheese trend of 5 years ago.  There are a few restaurants locally in the South Hils that are trending in this direction.  Mac n Toz and Hello Bistro come to mind.  The Yard does not do grilled cheese well.  What they do is slap a piece of industrial cheese that doesn't melt on each side of a piece of Texas toast and put it under a heater.  They then grill the fillings separately and stuff them into the fake grilled cheese.  It's gross and most of the fillings are full of potatoes.  So many potatoes.  So much bread.  Fake not-melted plastic-looking cheese.  Not good.  Beer selection  - very good. Atmosphere - crowded.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty unique place, had a baby shower here and was very well impressed by the atmosphere, only wish the waitress was more attentive and heads up if you have a waitress don't bother to try and go to the bar-they won't serve you!"}
{"text":"I could have sworn I wrote a review already...since I've been 3 times now.  

After those three visits, I can sum up my review like this:

- The pretzel fondue app is the bee's knees.  And so is there Bacon Bloody Mary!  

- The fried chicken is definitely worth a try.

- It's way too loud inside the Culinary Dropout portion.

- The Yard (outdoor area) is where it's at since it's not as loud and because it's a neat little space.

- The service is shotty.  Each time I've been, the waitress/waiter has trouble hearing us and vice versa.  Or, it's hard to even get the person's attention because it is so packed.

- The parking situation is less than ideal.  But if you can't make it in the free valet parking, you can park across the street and jaywalk across.  

-  I much prefer Arrogant Butcher."}
{"text":"A friend and myself went to the newest Culinary Dropout (Fox Restaurant Concepts) located at The Yard last night for one of their invitation-only opening dinners and it was a great experience from beginning to end. This Central Phoenix neighborhood just got little more fun and friendly.

We were fortunate enough to meet the architect and signage designer and gave them a big congrats on a job well done. And there's more to come! In addition to Culinary Dropout, three more eateries will make The Yard their home: an oyster bar, sandwich shop, and coffee joint. It will be a neighborhood place to go, eat, hang out, meet new peeps, and support the local community.

I first want to thank Culinary Dropout for the generous dinner: two alcoholic drinks, appetizer, two entrees, and a desert. Though it was chilly and there are numerous heaters, the hostess originally sat us at a table that was not near a heater. The beautiful white marble top was cold enough to starting mixing some Cold Stone on it with Butterfinger mix-ins. We politely asked to be relocated to a table with a heater, and without hesitation and with a smile, we moved immediately. The friendly waitress by the name of Jessica was knowledgeable about the food offerings, professional, and personable from the beginning 

We asked for recommendations for every course. She picked out our antipasto appetizer, which consisted of two meats, cow and goat's milk cheeses and roasted beets (I can't remember the exact meats or cheeses...sorry). When asked what entrees she recommends - after I told her no fish for me - she recommended the 36-hour pork ribs and the fried chicken. Both were amazing and the ribs peeled right off the bone. They do supply you with handy-wipes for your sticky fingers which was nice. We finished the meal of with the chocolate tart with sugar cookie crust and salty toffee chips on top. Table next to us had another dessert that smelled amazing. That would be the Monkey Bread and definitely getting it next time. 

Even though they just opened, there was not one glitch nor an ounce of chaotic servers running around like their heads were cut off. It was a very smooth show on our end. 

One reason why I really like this establishment is because of what it offers. It is VERY spacious. There's an 8,000 square foot covered patio. Two fire pits and great lounge sofas and beautiful wing chairs all covered in a soothing green create several outdoor living room areas. After dinner you can chill and chat on the sofas or you can work off your meal by playing Corn Hole, ping pong, or shuffle something (it is a table with pucks that you push for points...I think). Anyway, there is seating everywhere and plenty of elbowroom. 

Thanks again to all the folks who greeted us with smiles. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot and it really doesn't matter what day you come there's always a crowd because it is so big. Me and friends usually come for drinks and to chill, end up playing cornhole.

The food was ok. I've been a couple of times and the servers are hit or miss. At times very attentive and then other times ghost. 

Comp valet parking."}
{"text":"This place looks cool and is a nice atmosphere but the staff are all incredibly rude, even when not busy."}
{"text":"Been here several times 

Food and service is impeccable(Eddie c was our waiter) 
Doesn't matter which sandwich you order , you will not be disappointed. 
Portions are plentiful and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"I live nearby but have only been here twice and have little inclination to return. The price to quality ratio is on the high side even if the ambiance is cool. The second time I was here with friends was a near disaster service-wise that was only made whole by the food being comped. Kudos at least for that. Parking is an issue but I think that's being improved as another group of establishments is set to open to the south. Even so, you can always park across the street in the shopping center parking lot and no, it's not a half mile to the crosswalk more like 2/10 of a mile."}
{"text":"Great concept! Lively atmosphere after work. My husband recently went for happy hour with folks from work. There were about 6 of them. They were enjoying their drinks. However, when my husband ordered a cup of soup, the hostess came to the table to tell the party that there was a reservation coming in and they would have to leave. 
I have since heard from The Yard as you can see below my review. They explained the situation. Perhaps they could have offered another table for those that wanted to stay, but they were very communicative throughout the evening. I appreciate their response and will consider a return trip to experience more their menu options."}
{"text":"As of December 2017, they're doing very well here. I like it a lot. 

I've dined at the Shadyside location a dozen or more times over the years. I pleased to say this Galleria location is just as good. 

My suggestions:

- The Mac Attack is a good starting point if you're not sure about exotic grilled cheese sandwiches. 

- I've have three or four other grilled cheeses and have never been disappointed. 

- The salads are very fresh and crisp. The blackened chicken Caesar is a winner. 

- The grilled chicken sandwich is good; haven't tried the burger yet (and may never until I sample more grilled cheeses).

Finally, I can say the servers are good. They balance a bar-crowd with the dining crowd, many times with young kids. (It's fine for families, but occasionally you might see a table of sloshed sports viewers getting a bit rowdy...)"}
{"text":"A friend decided to have her birthday shindig here and I have to say it was a great choice.  We had a party of 20 something including kids, so the space alone was nice to have. Everyone stayed entertained whether it was sitting in the comfy chairs/couches chatting away or playing a little cornhole and ping pong. We were there at least 5 hrs and I wouldn't have minded staying longer if I had the time.  Our server Britney was amazing! She was on top of it the entire time and super friendly.  Our entire group kept saying how great the service was. Not just Britney, but everyone helping her deliver everything we ordered. Will  definitely be back and will recommend to everyone! Thank s for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Spacious, lofty and fun atmosphere.  Sat at the bar for after dinner drinks and listened to live music (2 guitarists).  Music was good, drinks were cold and a diverse crowd (hipsters, professionals, tourists, locals, all age groups, but most importantly it was a friendly crowd).  Love the hanging lights and the couches, which has that industrial/backyard/comfy/chill vibe.  I would go back to try the food and the games.  The day we went, they had the area reserved for a corporate event, so we didn't get to explore the bar games.  It was on a Friday night and it was very busy.  Be prepared to wait if you go late on a weekend.  Cool, hip spot to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch at the Yard. We really enjoyed it! We split the it's always sunny amd frank the tank sandwiches. Both were delicious but we preferred the frank the tank! The food came out hot and quick! 

Damon, our waiter, was amazing! He took time to explain the menu and I never saw the bottom of my glass! 

The prices are fair, we each got a whole sandwich but next time I would be satisfied with a half (which is am option)! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the Yard for a drink after visiting a few other places in Market Square.  We had already eaten but I decided to take a look at their food menu just to see the offerings.  We have been to the Shadyside location for Brunch before but not to order off the regular menu.  Their niche is grilled cheese sammies done a bunch of different ways with or without protein.  They have cute names for their menu items like, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which happens to be like one of the best shows ever made.  

I opted for a Bourbon drink name the perfect gentleman.  It was smooth, albeit pricey but that is to be expected.  Service at the bar was neither stellar nor bad so this visit was good.  Since I'm not a huge greasy bar food fan I don't know if I'd come back to eat but you never know."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the variety, excellent food and entertainment! Have a drink, eat some fabulous food and play games! Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Original I had posted a very disappointed review because of a way a waitress approach to us, however I have to give It to Hank the manager of this place and how connected he is to his YELP reviews.  He immediately came to our table and offer us a way to make us feel welcome and appreciated to be here.  He also gave us a FREE drink.  I have to say his reaction was so fast and is because of his management skills that we will continue meeting our clients here for events."}
{"text":"The only reason I am withholding the 5th star is because this place is only open until midnight on Friday and Saturday.  We got there at 11:30 expecting to have a couple hours to have drinks and play some cornhole, only to be informed at the bar that they're closing soon and don't want to check out any more sets of beanbags.  There were still at least 100 people hanging around at this point, most of whom stayed until at least 1:00 am - well after they stopped serving at the bar.  It just seems stupid to me that a place like this, clearly DESIGNED as a hangout where people can drink and socialize (as opposed to just a restaurant), would shut down before the state-mandated 2:00 am closing time.  When there are still that many people hanging around after the bar shuts down, it's a clear signal that you are simply leaving money on the table.  

The Yard is a really cool concept that is only going to get better with time.  I was so excited about the opening of this place - I live only a few minutes walking distance away and am looking forward to it becoming a regular hang out for me and my friends.  The games, the drinks, the atmosphere...it has all the components to become long-term neighborhood gem for people in the central corridor/north Phoenix area.  I just hope they wise up with respect to the hours they keep and extend closing time on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"I am in love with The Yard! When we have a fun guest in town, this has just become our 'go to' place to take them! This particular night was an old fraternity brother from my boyfriends college days. What's better than taking him to The Yard for some good loud fun and a beer in a bag and good bites too. Heck, if he is really feeling like getting nostalgic, there are even bags to play out in .. well, what else, the 'yard', or the big vast patio, where we always opt to sit. We always Uber it here because the drinks are strong and well, drink accordingly, if you plan to drink. I don't much these days, but I still may and this is the place to try out some of your 'vices'. Know that you will likely wait. We have no issues bellying up to the bar. The staff is always friendly and the most we have ever waited is about 35 minutes. It's a great time to socialize and talk. My boyfriend and his frat brother opted for the beer in the bag special, $2, let them relive their college memories for at least a good ten minutes! I stuck with my water and lemon for now because I wanted to have one 'vice' for the evening and sleep well! We have our favorites now at The Yard. We always get the fondue and pretzel balls. If you haven't; you must. I love the deviled eggs too, but not everyone does. So this time we got the house potato chips with the TO die for french onion dip. I had personally not had this app before and it was good; fattening beyond words, when you add the pretzels and fondue, but worth it! NOW I decided I needed a drink. I decided to get out of my wine comfort zone and have a real cocktail. I ordered a mule type of drink called a, Ginger and Mary Ann. A concoction I loved a little too much of Stoli vodka, fruited smash, lime squeeze, and topped with ginger beer. Yum. Yum. But, one is enough. I had the shaved prime rib and a side salad for dinner; heavenly. The prime rib is done just right at medium rare and I am so picky about this, I always ask! I left with half to eat the next day. Must have been those heavenly pretzels, I can't get enough of! I love the vibe and energy of The Yard and it has fast become one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Our friend was a fan too and we were able to put him on his plane back to North Carolina with a full belly and a fun time in the books!"}
{"text":"This place was fun....30 ish year old crowd. It was fun, not to loud, televisions with sports, good beer, GREAT WINGS, prices were resonable! I like this place. In pittsburgh for the steelers game....no fans here which was weird considering steelers fans are everywhere....but still awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday afternoon. First time there. Great food and great service. Love the Bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"Good experience on a busy Saturday night at this suburban location. We reserved through open table and were seated immediately upon arrival. Our Waitress was attentive and personable.

Food is generous and unpretentious. Beer selection looks adequate, but I'm no expert there.

The fattoush salad is a fantastic vegetarian option. The rest of our group (meat eaters, every last one of them) humored me by trying the veg of the day - spicy cauliflower as an appetizer. The flavor was good, but honestly it was a little greasy.


I wish they had better takeout/leftover containers; we can't recycle the styrofoam (PS6) in our curbside. And we had to wait a long time for our check. But I guess that's better than being rushed. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Good food, nice beer selection.

Enjoyed the ambiance. Will be back"}
{"text":"Food was ok, the service was good.  This place is cool and is famous for 'gourmet' grilled cheese.  I just call it overpriced grilled cheese. Positives are they have a kids menu with crayons and stuff and are kid friendly.  Pittsburgh Salad was good and had a fried egg on top.  The WacArnold was good (their play on a Big Mac- Patty melt style), but a tip would be to skip the lettuce on it. It's that mixed green lettuce and it comes to you all wilted and makes the sandwich taste like dirt.  They have vegetarian options also for the veg lovers.  It's decent and I'd say to try it for something a little different. Lots of beers on tap too."}
{"text":"Didn't have a great experience here. Went with a couple friends and saw they had ping pong tables to play so figured we'd give it a go. Talked to the host and was informed that they were out of paddles. I found this interesting since they had four tables but only two occupied. I asked about this and he said that guests will get the paddles and hold on to them for the length of their meal then play again. I asked if this was \"cool\" and he said \"yes\". Seems like a very poor policy to allow people to hold part of the facilities for the length of their stay and prevent others from enjoying them.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"The customer service at this place is beyond ridiculous. I get it, you're busy. If you hate your job... Quit. There is no reason to be passive aggressive assholes. From one customer service person to another--- there is no room for this behavior in a location as great as this. I'm not ranting about just ONE person- it was all THREE of the bartenders tonight. I will never be coming back. I'm sure the 2 different ladies trying to order drinks next to used feel the same way.!"}
{"text":"Food was not great. Service was poor. Atmosphere was the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with family and friends for awhile now. It's about time I reviewed it. I won't reiterate and rehash what others have reviewed already. I will just point out what was relevant to my experiences.

The positives:

- The overall concept and execution is great. It really is a fun atmosphere. I come here for the games, particularly table tennis. The Farmer avenue location in Tempe has a better table layout, but the phoenix one isn't bad for casual play.

- The food isn't bad. I would suggest enjoying them on a different day, when it isn't so busy. You can really take the time to savor it in peace. Mondays are normally a good day for casual and calmer (quieter?) dining.

The negatives:

- Parking on Fridays and Saturdays. I've been here each and every day of the week, and these days are just a bear. I've even arrived here at 4PM, and valet was backed up. Yes, you can park by the hardware store after 5PM, or across / down the street, but it is a cat and mouse game trying to cross that street.

- Microcephalic Neanderthals (translation: Douchebags). My daughter and I have been playing ping pong since she was a little girl (she's still a little girl *smile*). She just recently graduated and wanted to see if she could spend some quality time with her dad. I've always made it a point to take all my daughters on dates since they were little so that they could experience how a lady should be treated (as I have treated their mom) when they get older. I wanted to avoid them bringing home a miscreant that mistreats them. Unavoidable in this place. We had a good game going and this group of degenerates try to hit on her (can't help it if she has her mom's looks), and then when she blows them off, then they try to interrupt the game by challenging her. They lose. The conduct continues and I finally intervened and spotted them 10 points and still beat them. They moved on to cornhole - goes well with them being buttholes! I guess being schooled by a girl was just too much for them. I was hoping for a quiet father / daughter time, but this day was just not one of those days. 

Overall, if you can get past the two busiest days, it is a great fun and hangout vibe. Unless, you like that kind of crowded scene. To each, his or her own!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday afternoon and arrived at 4 o'clock.  Upon checking in to get a table, we were greeted by a polite young female hostess.  I was informed, in order to get a table a phone number is required.  I was put off by this, asked why and was told this is how the paging system works.  

Really?  You need my personal information!! I don't know why I have a problem with this but I do.  

Ultimately, I gave her my number.  At this point, I decided to ask how long the wait was.  She politely advised 30 minutes.  It was at this time that the pompous  tattooed male hostess, leaning against the wall, gave a snarky reply, \"more like 45 minutes\".  

Can you be anymore unprofessional!  First, get your foot off the wall, uncross your forearms, stand up straight, and face those entering the restaurant and show a little bit of respect!  

I would have fired this guy on the spot due to his tone and disrespect if I owned this place!!  Total jerk! 

Needless to say, my date and I didn't even get past the entry way because of this! 

I will never come back to this place!  Why wait in line to valet your car, then wait 30 minutes or more to be seated, only to be served run of the mill food that is pricey.  This isn't a five star restaurant with a all star famous chef!  Come on!  

There are so many better places to go that have exceptional customer service and great food in central PHX! Don't waste your time here!!!  

Thank you \"The Yard\" for setting us straight about your place of business!  

(5-4-13 is when we attempted to try this place)"}
{"text":"Sam Fox does it again!  In fact, in my opinion, this is his best endeavor yet! I've been excitedly awaiting the opening of The Yard and it exceeded my expectations.  The well rounded culinary dropout menu has several solid new additions including a very nice Crispy Shrimp Caesar.  The antipasti is as solid as they get.  Great variety - love the beautiful presentation of yummy tete de moine cheese, and the roasted beets are delicious!  

Solid food and beverage is key, but what really sends this place over the top is the space.  It is notably large but the use of the space is just absolutely cool!  Great indoor/outdoor feel.  The huge game area on the patio is outstanding!  Lots of cornhole/bag toss and bocce courts and several ping pong tables!  With the addition of more tv's coming on the patio, this will be the place to come watch a game and play some games.  

Lots of parking in the back and plenty of bicycle racks on the patio for those who want to roll in on two wheels.

Very excited for the upcoming addition of Lil' Cleo's Fish House and Oyster Bar and also a coffee shop coming in the near future.

This place is just pure, tasty fun!  Go and see for yourself."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Did I say really good? I meant exceptionally good. The anti-pasta is delicious, and even their burgers are gourmet style. They fondue is off the chain good.

I sat at the bar with a friend and we had a good time hanging out here. We met a bartender named Sarah who was really pleasant and friendly, got us everything we needed in record time, and made us feel really comfortable being there even though the place was packed.

Even though it was busy, you could still get around and there's always room. I would have given 5 stars but the only thing I don't like about here is that you have to use the valet to park. Other than that, everything was amazing and I love coming up here!"}
{"text":"The set up is sweet, but the service and food is lacking. I was served raw chicken with no silverware. Had to ask the server for water 3 times and still never received anything. Then to make matters worse, somehow they ended up charging me for an order of ribs that i never ordered. the server argued and pleaded with us until a friend wound up paying for it. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DUMP!!! 
Way to Mr. Fox."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!! The best grilled cheese I've ever had!  Many beer and drink choices. The place is small and loud. It was very busy when we were there, but great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Been there twice....probably won't ever go back.  

Major parking issues, \"complimentary\" valet.....not really.  Waited in line to valet for 10 minutes or so each time.

We were told they don't take reservations.....but apparently they do.  We were told that they do \"random\" reservations.  ????

Great concept but LOTS of kinks!!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another one of Sam Fox's great restaurants.  I would have gave a fourth star but I do not think the staff is equipped enough to handle the large crowds.  Since this place has an indoor relaxing vibe and the outdoor is a hangout athletic patio, there is alot going on and to handle with one kitchen.  I have been here multiple times now and not once was the server on top of their game.  

Food is great here, always high expectations from any of his restaurants.  This is a great spot to hang out with friends after work and it is my new favorite place for dinner, drinks and outdoor games!  They have a great variety with shuffle board, ping pong and some others.  It is hard to come and play outdoors in the peak of the heat so wait until it cools down.  

I love the grilled artichokes here, I am sucker every time.  Great salads too.  I plan to try some other entrees the next time I come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was a huge let down after reading so many amazing reviews that said this place was  awesome. The place was pretty empty we came in, but our service was mediocre. We had to ask for refills and ask twice for condiments after our food was brought out. That wasn't the let down though, the worst part was the food. I had the \"slap yo mama\" - the pulled chicken was bland and dried out, the Texas toast wasn't nothing special. The overall sandwich just didn't have a good taste. We also had the appetizer nachos and the pulled chicken on that was also bland, tasteless, and dry. The nachos had no flavor - just bland plain chicken, chips, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. It needed something on it for flavor. The other person with me had a burger, and it was just a boring, could get a similar burger anywhere, burger. Overall super sad experience, we are not from around here and were looking for a fun Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"I'm giving five stars because a) they have gluten free bread, so I can actually experience the menu, and b) they have lots of creative options.  

The gluten-free bread isn't the most flavorful, and it's a little dry, but it works and it's not awful.  It's some kind of seed-y variety.  The menu has two sides, one entirely for grilled cheese and the other for typical food options.  The waitress asked us for our drink order as soon as we sat down, before we'd had time to look at anything.  The drink menu at the table didn't seem to have what my bf was looking for, and the waitress (who we later found out was new) didn't seem to have a clue, but he was able to clear it up with the bartender and get the drink he wanted.  The water was served in little mason jars, which was a nice touch.  

The burgers and sandwiches are huge!  The how-the-hell-are-people-supposed-to-get-that-in-their-mouths kind.  We both (lol) ordered the Big Che-bowski grilled cheese with the garlic-parm chips, and all the grilled cheeses come with tomato soup for dipping.  The tomato soup reminded me of pasta sauce and was very tasty.  The chips weren't my favorite... But the soup helped tremendously.  The sandwich was two fried eggs, bacon, cheddar and Gouda, and one slice of tomato.  It was very good, although the eggs were hardly fried and I ended up with yolk everywhere.  It also could have used a couple leaves of arugula, or something green and fresh like that.  I'll try something different next time.  But there will be a next time!  

The decor leaves a little but to be desired, personally.  It's a bit industrial and cold...  Maybe that will improve with time, since it is a brand new spot."}
{"text":"Nice place but the service kind of sucks. Ordered a beer- the first one took forever and the second was delivered to the wrong table. They switched the orders of our burgers and my sister got one medium rare wth no sauce (which was supposed to be my step moms) and vice versa. Needless to say, we won't be back"}
{"text":"Came here the other day to celebrate father's day with a group of 10 people. The service was good. When I first came here my initial impression was rather good, but I've after coming back this time around it just didn't feel the same anymore. The food was okay, nothing to rave about. And the portions weren't very consistent . We had 2 orders of the mussels, one plate came with plenty while the other was maybe half of that order. This place does have a pretty good happy hour and it still is a good place to hang out with a big group of people."}
{"text":"Like a lot of other people, I have mixed feelings about this place. It's a very cool concept & I like it, but....... When it's busy, it's a bit of a nightmare. Finding parking if you don't valet is not fun & you run the real risk of your car being towed in a lot of the surrounding areas. The wait is often long, most of the comfortable open seating areas are in fact not open, but reserved. The bar is too small for the size of the place in my opinion too. It just feels like you have no where to really go while you are waiting for your table when it's busy. The food, Culinary Dropout, is good, but nothing spectacular. I like the cheese & pretzel fondue & house chips/dip for appetizers. The Gorgonzola Chicken salad is pretty good too. It's a fun place to hang out with friends when it's not crazy busy. I also like that it is close enough to my home that I can ride my bike there."}
{"text":"I had the butternut squash cannelloni and it was amazing.  This place did not disappoint.  Sam Fox does such a great job with each of his concepts.  The Sex Panther beer was also quite good.  After dinner we played ping pong and foosball which was also super fun.  All in all a great dinner and entertainment venue.  I can't wait to try Little Cleo's too."}
{"text":"Similar to a few other reviews, disappointed in the downtown location. had the 'smack yo mama' grilled cheese (bbq pulled chicken) with sweet potato fries. The pulled chicken was too chooey for my liking. and the sweet potato fries were a little too hard and cold. which was surprising since the service was very fast - wasn't sure how the fries got cold when the food came so quickly.

have had a much better experience at the shadyside location."}
{"text":"Coming from Washington there is no place like this! I love the feel when I walk in and see how open the restaurant is. Everyone was smiling and happy. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends!


Ps. Tylor was our server and he was awesome! Thanks for the great service"}
{"text":"It's not typical of me to hit the bar with a friend to grab some beers but I was in AZ for a conference so I met up with an old Army buddy at this place. It was perfect! I mean beer is beer but the service at the bar was great! Valet parking was a bonus, and the pork belly nachos were killer! This place seems like it would be a ton of fun and I wish there was one closer to me in southern California. I guess there will be another trip in my near future! Keep it up, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you keep adding restaurants to this spot with no parking solution, then it's a fail. 
Our server was not personable. If you have your server \"remember\" a customer's orders instead of writing it down, then they should actually REMEMBER the order and not mess it up. Also, our server said we had to provide a credit card in order to open a tab before we ordered our meal. I have no issue with that, however, when I asked for my bill she brought me the receipt. She never asked me if I wanted it on my card or if I wanted to pay cash. My intention was to pay cash and I never even got that option. I will never go back to this restaurant. Epic fail. 
PS....the burger was cold and there were no gluten free options on this menu.  Terrible waste of money....."}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time here. I've always been more then pleased with the service, food, and atmosphere. My visit last night was an exception. We arrived a little before 9:00 and the place was empty. We were quickly seated, but our server Audrey seemed less then pleased to be waiting on us. She was misssing when it came time for refills, couldn't be bothered to walk around the table and reached over all our plates, and took my sister plate while she was still eating. As a server, I realize everyone has bad days. But Besides the unfriendly server, the food was decent. The soup was ice cold. Probably won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Was here a couple of days ago with my team at work for a Christmas dinner. After we had our meal at Culinary Dropout, we went over to The Yard. It's a large outdoor space (covered) with ping pong tables and other games. Our Team Leader is a regular there and likes to play Ping Pong so we played a few games amongst each other. The place offers rackets and balls that you can get by presenting your ID. 

The place is nice and spacious. It's not limited to a particular crowd. Families with kids show up there on weekends, as I was told. It seems like a really fun place to be at any day of the week. It was buzzing even on a Tuesday afternoon! 

If you live in Phoenix or close, head over there with friends and try it out!"}
{"text":"I like how comfortable the setting is here. It is another great spot for a relaxing sunday afternoon. Food was delicious and I like how there are many activities to keep everyone entertained."}
{"text":"Your experience at The Yard depends completely on when you go. I enjoy going here for lunch and they have excellent food. I really do not like going from Happy Hour on.  Their parking turns into valet only, which is a problem when you are not in the habit of carrying cash. And it gets really busy! So, I would avoid evenings, especially on the weekends, if you don't want to go when it is crazy busy, hard to find parking, and really loud. Other times, it is great.  They have a ton of space with both indoor and outdoor spaces. They also have various games, such as cornhole, which is a lot of fun. Time it right and you will have a great time!"}
{"text":"I've had a few things there and one important thing to know about the Yard is some of their food is sort of gross (grilled cheeses) but some of their dishes are superb. 

Their mac and cheese balls are simply delicious. I also love their chicken and waffles for brunch with an important caveat; the waffles taste like cardboard but the chicken is very tasty. I always ask to replace the waffles with french toast and the ensuing Chicken and French Toast is a very good brunch meal"}
{"text":"This is a rather unique place, even in Phoenix. The complex is massive and is mostly a covered patio with several bars and restaurants. We were here for Happy Hour which is a good deal. This is a place to see and be seen and is obviously a popular meet up spot. The decor is pleasantly quirky and charming.

The food was above average, but nothing spectacular. We only had the bar snacks including the chips and Korean kabob which were tasty. The dinner menu looked interesting, but I think this is really a bar with food rather than a full blown restaurant. Service was fair, but our waitress was nice and attractive too.

They have complimentary valet parking which is good and bad, but helps you find the entrance which is in the back. I can see how this place is popular."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience in Black Friday. Hostess was stoned out of her mind. Food was brought out an hour after ordering and was presented cold to the touch. The signature soup had actually filmed over it had become so cold. Cooks delivering food didn't seem to care about what they were providing. The inevitable discussion with management revealed an overwhelmed person who was probably afraid to say anything to the cooks. The only person in the restaurant that cares was the waitress.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place since it is within walking distance of my house.  We've had problems every time that we've went.  We've been five times, but walked away twice due to the wait.

During out last visit, we went for happy hour at 4PM on a Sunday.  Unfortunately they seated us on the wrong side where happy hour isn't available (?!?).  There is two different restaurants in the same space with different seating rules and menus, but this isn't immediately clear ... and happy hour is only available in certain areas?  By the time we found someone who was able to explain this to us, the few high tops where we could get 'happy hour menu' were taken.

Service has been consistently slow for all three visits, even though the place wasn't packed.  Slow for drinks, slow for food.  

On our last visit, it took ~20 minutes to get iced tea after being seated.  We ordered two burgers and a salad.  When the food finally arrived 25-30 minutes later, one of the burgers was undercooked and the fries were completely cold.  It took another 10 minutes to wave down our waitress, who took the order back.  A manager got involved with the situation, but our guest didn't get their burger and fries until well after we were done.

On a final note, this place isn't cheap.  For example, $6 for a pint of Moose Drool and $7 for a pint of Guinness.  If you aren't sitting in the right section during happy hour, the tab can get expensive very fast."}
{"text":"I'm automatically in when someone says grilled cheese.  And when it's gourmet?  Heck yes, I'll try anything once!  Well, I've tried the Yard twice now, and I must admit that I'm of mixed feelings about it.  Here's what they get right: great service, and pretty fast, too.  The sweet potato waffle fries and the accompanying cinnamon sugar butter are so, so delicious.  Sandwiches come with a small side of tomato soup, and though I have only been there twice, each time the soup tasted a bit different, as though they haven't quite landed on the recipe yet.  For the record, I preferred the first encounter, where it tasted almost like a roasted red pepper and tomato soup.  The second time it tasted like straight tomato, and it was a bit too acidic.  This, I suppose, is a good time to point out the really not so good, which is the bread situation.  Now, they use really nice, thick bread, which is a good start.  Where these grilled cheese sandwiches are missing the mark is the truly *grilled* part.  The bread comes out so dry that I suspect that it's actually toasted, not grilled.  I guess that's  good if you're watching calories and don't want your bread grilled in butter until it caramelizes the sugars in the bread and achieves that nice golden brown crust.  But friends, if I'm already ordering a sandwich with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg, I can tell you that I most assuredly am NOT coming here looking to cut calories.  Please grill the bread.  Like, greasy diner grill it.  Please.  That would make the entire experience that much closer to perfect and worth the price."}
{"text":"I've visited The Yard many times over the years and have never been disappointed by their wide selection of grilled cheese sandwiches. It's always hard to choose because they all sound delicious (especially on a hungover Sunday morning). 

However, this time I visited, I opted for a healthier choice: fattoush. I wasn't even jealous of all of my friends eating their grilled cheese sandwiches because it was so good! The lettuce and veggies were extremely fresh, and it was a large serving that includes toasted pita, too. I also loved the dressing, a refreshing and light lemony-mint dressing.

Our table also had their buffalo chicken dip and mac attack balls... all delicious and highly recommended!

Great location, great food, and they offer nearly bottomless mimosas and bloody maries!!"}
{"text":"This location does not have a Bloody Mary bar and there was no indication of that on the site or anywhere. My omelet was excellent, however, I ordered a side of toast and it came unbuttered and the charge was FOUR DOLLARS. lol 4 bucks for two slices of bread! Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful. This location is smaller than the shady side location but the same menu, other than the Bloody Mary bar  :( safe to say, I will drive the extra to go to shady side."}
{"text":"This was the most interesting thing I ate in my week in Pitt. I wish it hadn't been a business lunch and I had been able to dive in with my full interest. 

The Blarney Stoner was a special beast of a sandwich, and the fries were great."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night on a recommendation from a friend. I was looking for a place to go get some dinner. Was treated to a mandatory valet parking. Ok that's fine.... Go into the bar sit down the bar tender was great! They had a lot of beer on tap. Great selections!!!! When I looked at the menu there were a lot of oddball items to pick from. Just kinda one off stuff... The beer selection was good the employees were great.... Just wasn't thrilled with the menu.... I would suggest you look at it online before you try to find something you like when you get there...."}
{"text":"Meh, not impressed at all, and it's very expensive.  Some of the food items are really good, others just alright.   I had one of their most expensive meals and found the beef quality just ok, with way way way too much sugar in the sauce.  The deli meats and cheeses are ordered by item so you can get what you want exactly, and they are top quality.  The pretzel fondue was excellent.

Service was very good and friendly.  The atmosphere is kind of cool, but the metal chairs are simply horrible to sit on.  I guess that's how they keep you from hanging around too long after your meal.  It's also hipster central, so you can at least have some amusement people-watching.

Oh yeah, and the entire parking lot was blocked off for valet parking.  I don't want to deal with a valet line, or even really want to give the car to a valet.  The only other option is very limited street parking because most of it is resident-only parking.

We can't think of any reason to come back."}
{"text":"This place is so happening, I feel cooler just being there. Even better, they take cocktail craft seriously. Some of the best drinks I've ever had--fresh, unique ingredients, house-made sour mix, and not a maraschino cherry in sight. Decent local beer and wine list. 

The aesthetic is both energized and relaxing. Wingback chairs, comfy couches, eclectic lighting...I almost feel like I'm not in Phoenix! Plus watching dudes play corn hole gives me a giggle. 

Lotsa hipsters, but for what you get, I can deal."}
{"text":"General thoughts and conversations throughout the night:
Where do we park?
How do we get in? I don't see any signs pointing to the entrance. Can we use this gate? Nope, that doesn't open. Why is the entrance only in the back?
Is this hostess going to help us find our party of 14? No? Ok, we'll just wander and find them.
Am I really still in central Phoenix? Did Scottsdale invade?
This is such a bad idea for the summer.
Where's our waitress?
This food is so not worth the price. Is there even fish under all this batter? Oh, there it is... I think.
Where's our waitress? Why is no one clearing this table? There's no more room to even set glasses.
Has anyone seen our waitress?
Could this bathroom be any more confusing for people? Is it unisex? Is it not? Decide!
That mystery alcohol grab thing was such a waste of money. Ew.
I'm tired of waiting an hour to play a game. Let's leave and never come back."}
{"text":"The yard is fantastic,  great concept,  good drinks. So come out and play,  but probably eat before unless you are keen on heavy,  greasy food. ..maybe I'm harsh but culinary dropout food is very disappointing. ..well except for the pretzel bread things with cheese. One tip is to  figure out from the get go what the deal is with print your name on the list for games,  seems to always change,  and more often than not it makes no sense. I think they know people don't like the food so they make you wait by using excuses so you give in and eventually eat."}
{"text":"This place was a huge venue.....  they offerd so many different things to do it was crazy.  We listened to a live band at the bar.  Then we went a sat on some couches and conversated amungst our group of people.  Then we decided to play bags or cornhole.  After that they had shuffle board tables, ping pong tables, card tables, and even a fuseball table.  Such a cool thought out place.  Inside the bar there are 3 different resturants to choose from.  It is a concept unlike I have seen back in the midwest area.  Very nicely done.  We will be back for sure when visiting again."}
{"text":"Only 3 1/2 stars in the overall rating?  Are you kidding?  This is such a phenomenal place that it is way beyond 5 stars!!  The food is gourmet at its finest! The staff is upbeat, very welcoming, and fantastic!!  The atmosphere is like sensory overload for your eyes cause there's so much you want to look at.  

Upon arriving I was greeting by a few upbeat people at the hostess station.  One gentleman asked if I'd been there before and when I said I hadn't he gave me a personal tour.  Who does that?  

I believe I got this correct but please don't quote me just in case ;)  The Yard consists of Culinary Dropout (bar and gaming type environment), Little Cleo's Seafood Legend (seafood restaurant) and Barrio Urbano (street tacos).  There's basically a big open space that includes a bar section, gaming section with ping pong, foosball, skeeball, etc, the street taco restaurant (Barrio Urbano), and a seafood restaurant (Little Cleo's).  It's so big that there may even be sections that I'm not aware of!! They have high top tables, low tables, couches, patio chairs, cushiony single chairs, coffee tables, fire pits, and it's huge so you're not sitting on top of anyone!!  The largest area is Culinary Dropout then the restaurants are sectioned off but with an open space décor.  It doesn't matter where you sit, you can still see everything.  

I first sat in the Culinary Dropout section in a big, comfy, oversized chair to order appetizers before going to eat dinner.  The appetizer ordered was Soft Pretzel with Provolone Fondue.  The pretzel was by far the softest, yummiest pretzel I've ever had in my life, then you dip the warm pretzel in the melted provolone, which makes it the yummiest appetizer I've ever had in my life.  It was ridiculously delicious!!  My friend wanted to order the House Chips but I'm not a big fan of chips yet those chips were not like your average ones.  Oddly, they'll make a non-chip lover enjoy chips. Those pretzels though!!!  I'm still dreaming about those friggin' pretzels!!  Can't wait to go back and have them again!  Althogh named Culinary Dropout, I can assure you those pretzels and chips were not made by dropouts ;) 

Eventually, I moseyed on over to Little Cleo's some delectable seafood. I opted for small dishes since I filled up on those friggin' pretzels from Culinary Dropout.  We ordered and shared Sweet Corn Hushpuppies, Ahi Tuna Tartare, King Crab w/ Butter & Grilled Bread, Butternut Squash Gratin and the King Crab salad.  I'd never had Sweet Corn Hushpuppies so this was my first experience.  I'm not a big fried food girl so wasn't sure how I was going to feel about them.  Amazing!!  Not sure if all hush puppies taste like that but I will try them again.  The Ahi Tuna Tartare was a nice size chunk of tuna in a cucumber shell.  The tuna was fresh so it melted in your mouth.  The fresh tuna with the coolness from the cucumber and freshness from tuna made for a delicious appetizer.  The king crab with butter and grilled bread is absolutely addicting! It was served in a jar with melted butter.  The crab pieces were large in size and mouthwatering. The Butternut Squash Gratin...outstanding!!!  It was sweet in taste similar to a sweet potato but not really.  It's nearly impossible to describe the taste but I can tell you it was creamy and smooth.  Since I'm not a big sweet potato type person you would think I wouldn't like it if someone described it.  It was the best dish I had at this restaurant.  As for the King Crab salad, I wasn't a big fan of it.  I felt it was particular smaller than the salads I'm used to in Los Angeles, which would have been fine but I didn't feel there was enough substance.  There seemed to be a lot of lettuce and very little of everything else.  If you're looking for a small salad to have for yourself as an appetizer than this salad may be the perfect thing.  

Every single employee that I interacted with was friendly, catered to my every whim with delight and helpful when making selections.  I've dealt with servers at other places that never really tell you what their favorite menu item is.  Instead, they'll make comments such as, \"everything is great.\"  I like details, people.  What is your favorite, and why does it stand out so much?  The people I interacted with at The Yard were excellent and have exceptional customer service skills!!   

I wish The Yard was in my area because you couldn't get me to leave.  I'm saddened that a dear friend moved to Phoenix but now I have 2 reasons to go visit. I am confident I will visit The Yard on every single time I visit Phoenix.  I love that place!!  Next, I gotta try those tacos!!"}
{"text":"I just moved from Scottsdale to Denver, and had my going away shin dig here. I have been waiting a long time to find a place like this, and I have to say I'm a little bit surprised it was FRC that did it. 

If you like getting drunk and playing games simultaneously then this is your place. There are five ping pong tables. Probably 8 games of bags or cornhole going, at least on shuffle board and live music. All of this is under an open air pavilion with misters going. 

While it is the perfect idea, logistically, it's not quite perfect yet. Either people bring their own ping pong paddles or they have too many sets because on several occasions I have gotten lucky enough to get paddles from the hostess (which isn't easy when its busy) and then all the tables were filled. I have never gotten bags as they have always been checked out. 

Also, they don't have rumpy or jaeger because they are a \"mixology bar\"... whatever they are fun to take shots of."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of grilled cheese.  That statement is an accurate one.  Grilled cheese is such a simple meal to create and comforting, especially since we are getting into those colder months right now.  What is such a simple comfort food The Yard has taken and created some amazing, unique, and quite tasty twists that definitely comfort.

I had been milling around downtown for a good part of the morning debating on where to meet my friend for an early lunch.  I walked around Market Square inspecting all that there was to offer.  Including the ordinary chains that dot our American landscape and the local favorites of Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately for me, I was Primanti-ed out for once (I know, that sounds sacrilegious).  So I meandered over towards the Fifth Ave side of the Square and was happy to see that this place was open and more than delighted to see exactly the type of food on the menu.  Once my friend showed up it did not take much persuasion to convince her that The Yard was going to be our spot for the afternoon.

We showed up at a decent hour, no wait time to be seated and less wait time to have our drink orders taken.  Our server was gracious and gave us time to look over the menus as it was our first time here.  Once we stopped giggling at some of the names on the menu, I mean come on, tell me the Young Cheesy isn't a funny name, we were ready to place our orders.  As we waited for our orders to be prepared I started to do the longneck view of the space.  It is surprisingly bigger than you would expect.  It looks narrow from the outside, but it is quite big on the inside.  The dining/bar space stretches the length of the building, making for some great space to have a meal, drink a brew and maybe catch a game on one of the televisions.  

Once the food arrived I didn't pay much attention to my surroundings, I had to concentrate.  I had ordered The Mac Attack.  Spiral mac n' cheese between to slices of Texas toast with cheese.  Mixed into the spiral mac were these delicious burst of bacon lardons.  Cooked perfectly to pack a punch of flavor.  Eating this beast was not an easy task as you can imagine.  I mean it is mac n' cheese on a grilled cheese.  A fork is needed to clean up after you make an effort.

Shall we talk about the tomato soup?  Yes!  That tomato soup is house made and it is so delicious.  I wanted another bowl of that after I finished it off.  I just wish I wasn't so greedy with it and saved some for the end of the meal.  Dipping this particular grilled cheese is not a suggested task to do, you will lose some of the filling of the sandwich and that is not such a good idea, take it from me.  Along with the soup, I decided to upgrade mine to include fries instead of chips.  I got mine with the garlic parmesan dusting which gave me an extra bit of flavor.  Silly me ended up with cold fries as I was too busy with the grilled cheese and soup.  But they still tasted quite good.  On the smaller side for fries, but non-the-less they were good.

Beers on tap vary dependent on the season.  I suggest trying one of the vanilla stouts, a good mix for the variety of tastes you will be having and possibly a good substitute for a dessert.

The only downside I have is that it can get rather noisy in here.  But I take the blame for that seeing how I showed up during a Steelers game.

**I am happy to say that the front picture (at the time of me reviewing this) is the what you see when you view this business.**"}
{"text":"We went like 3-4 weeks ago for the first time and the host (a blonde one, skinny, and short) was really rude. Her attitude was the worst. She should not be host.
The ambiance was okay, the cocktail were decent.
I would not consider going back to this place. It's just too lame starting from the door until the people you get to see there.
No thanks!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool and I love the concept but there are a few things that will probably keep me from coming back here. They are as follows:

1) We had a fairly large group of people occupying an area in between two of the large couch areas (at one of the fire pits) but could not get a server to serve us. We assumed it was because we weren't actually sitting in any of the couches. That's pretty lame.

2) Since we had no server, we were required to go to the bar for drinks. This was quite the task considering the bartenders would not serve you unless you were sitting IN a bar chair/stool. I'm not new to the bar scene so I know for a fact that almost all bars will serve the annoying hoard of people hovering behind those seated at the bar. (Also, I'm not ugly....so I know it wasn't because of that).

3) They apparently HERD you into a line at the bar between two ropes where you have to either order beer or one of their weird concocted drinks. I felt like livestock.

4) The food is eh. 

5) Parking sucks. Just like every other \"Complimentary Valet\" having restaurant in the area. 

I'll give it another whirl but if the valet farts in my car like they did to some other Yelper I might just avoid The Yard altogether."}
{"text":"Bartender couldn't understand the difference between an IPA & a lager. Unacceptable! If your staff has no clue what beers they are serving, they don't deserve to be behind the bar."}
{"text":"Fun Place! Lots of happenings all around you with beautiful people! It is such a cool concept from  the mastermind Sam Fox!!!!! Great food. Good fun!"}
{"text":"The reviews are in, and I would agree with a 4 star rating. Not because the food is poor, or the service is bad, but mainly because of the price of what you are getting. I mean... Come on, its grilled cheese. Anywho! The only other downside other than the prices was that the place isnt that large, we waited a good 40 minutes for a table of 6 (it sort of appears that its not built for larger groups, so if you're less than a party of 5 you should be in for a shorter wait). We started with the Mac Attack's Balls and these were DEFINITELY worth the price. There were 6 of them and they were delicious. Who doesnt like deep fried mac and cheese balls? Of course, theres some ranch to dip them in too! After reading a few reviews I ended up getting a sandwich with Mac and Cheese. It did NOT disappoint. I ended up getting the \"Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer\", again, was not disappointed but the price seemed a little high. The menu is extensive, and it is not all inclusive to cheesy items. They do have salads, and burgers, and other sandwiches. The Yard is clearly geared towards the 21+ club. The draft list is long, and very well thought out, theres a beer out there for everyone! Sundays (the day were there) would be a great spot for a pre-steelers game spot. (Almost) Bottomless Mimosas for $15 dollars. You can get up to 15 Mimosas before you need to repurchase. If you can do that, kudos to you, I am impressed. They also have a bloody mary bar, I forget the prices on those, but they seemed fairly priced. There is a \"well\" price and a \"top-shelf\" price. Overall I would recommend this place to someone out of town that likes the low key bar atmosphere, and wants some good food. I will most likely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for happy hour. It's exceptionally loud with horrible acoustics, but whatever, it's a bar.  The happy hour drink specials were nice. I got a huge pour of house wine for only $4.

To order, a friend and I split the Mac n cheese balls and Bavarian pretzels. They were good but a huge grease fest. I wrapped my pretzels in napkins and within seconds the napkins were saturated with grease.  I would like to try the grilled cheese some time out of sheer curiosity, but they, too, looked like grease with side of grease chips.

Basically this seems like a place I would have enjoyed in my 20s when I was out all night, wasted off my a$$, looking for some obscenely unhealthy food to ram down at 230am.

That said, I heard brunch is great, particularly due to their $15 bottomless mimosas.

I would try the place one more time for brunch or to say I had one of the ridiculous grilled cheese, but that's likely the end of it for me."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and had a Bloody Mary, chorizo omelette and a couple beers. Time to dissect this place.

The atmosphere is neat.. It's upstairs with a good size bar with lots of beer on tap. 

The Bloody Mary was meh. During brunch hours they have unlimited Bloody Mary bar and a separate unlimited mimosa bar, but I had a single Bloody Mary.  It was so plain! I was disappointed beyond belief. They used Tabasco Bloody Mary mix, vodka, old bay rim, a lemon and a lime. Literally poured the mix out of the bottle into my glass. No love in the mix at all!! There are so many amazing restaurants downtown that know how to make a Bloody Mary, it's not worth it to go here. And it was 8$ on top of it all. 

The chorizo omelette.. Pretty tasty!  I liked it but it was a little cold, same with the hash browns.  But it all had flavor, so I ignored the temperature.

The beers were perfect. Great temperature and tasted fresh.  

It was a clean restaurant and worth a second trip. It's not the cheapest and there are better places to go, but this place is new.  Will give it another chance a little later."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch menu. Brun-cho's Bro, chicken waffle sliders. and blueberry pancakes all to die for! Great service. Atmosphere that is average pub style-the only reason for 4 not 5 stars."}
{"text":"So I came here on the recommendation of an acquaintance.

He sent me this text saying I should come find him at this \"awesome place\" which I found to be quite vague. So I called him and got the address and for some reason I heard him say beer pong instead of ping pong. 

I assume it is the result of my old janky phone and bad reception. I am broke and cannot afford a new one so miscommunication happens often...

I was only mildly disappointed that it was ping pong instead of beer pong and decided to play a few games. I discovered that I really really suck at ping pong

As for parking ....we just didn't use the blasted valet. We found a spot far far away from the bar. I have a bum ankle but was willing to gimp along if it meant avoiding the kind of headache that using valet usually entails. 

We decided to get some food and started off with ordering waters. Since it was so crazy busy I think the waiter completely forgot about us. I was slightly annoyed because I had just got to Phoenix from Detroit and could barely breathe due to the crazy climate. 

I am not kidding; I felt like my mouth was full of sand 24/7 so I was constantly chugging water. So I'm sitting like there wondering if we should just bug someone for some water.

So we are sitting there chilling out and I'm trying not to die of thirst/or heatstroke someone from management came up to us and apologized. He was really super nice and offered us free food. 

I wish I could remember his name because it was a nice gesture. But I can't think of it right now. So we had a bit of a wait but we did get our drinks and free food out of the deal!

The food there is expensive. That is just my opinion as a broke girl from Detroit. I got the cheapest thing on the menu....the salad and it was surprisingly good considering that it didn't have that much stuff on it.

The bathroom kind of tripped me out...I was afraid I had accidently wandered into the men's (which I have done before due to being something of a space cadet) because there were men at the sink when I walked in. As it turns out, there is a communal sink area and the bathrooms themselves are adjacent to that. 

So try not to have a panic attack when you see someone of the opposite sex in there when you walk in lol.

I felt kind of out of place ...I tend to like dive bars where I can dress like a scrub and just enjoy my drinks without trying to impress everyone in the place. Many of the women were decked out (I am talking stilettos and minidress and shit) and I was trying to understand why.

There was also a delightful smattering of douchebags and hipsters there. I have come to terms with this because they are becoming impossible to avoid. Hipsters are like death and taxes: nobody likes them but we have to deal with them anyway so we might as well get used to it.

So yeah, good food, drinks, and friendly management plus free food! I also learned how to play ping pong (sort of). No complaints here. 

The atmosphere was pretty chill with the exception of overdressed (or maybe I was underdressed?) people who can really cramp a chill vibe in a place. Overall, it was a pretty cool experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service great food. Server Joey crushed it and on a super busy day - easter. Great meal fun place."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I had the wings and burger. Just the wings alone are some of the best I have ever had... seriously. You wanna talk about the juiciest burger I have ever had? Let's talk about The Pub Burger that they offer here ,just by saying the name makes my mouth watery, this burger is one of the best I have ever had of my 20 years of living on this planet. The waiters are very nice and friendly, one even sings to you if it's your birthday. So yeah, I'm coming here again."}
{"text":"The Yard - Culinary Dropout is the perfect place to meet for happy hour or have a fun night out. There are tons of activities and the food is GREAT.

I am in love with the pretzels and the wings. Plus, they have great cocktails and a good selection of brews.

On the weekends, there is live music and it can be hard to find a table, but they do take reservations."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to The Yard. Any place that specializes in grilled cheese is good in my book. The beer selection is above average for market square."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a cool venue and so much to do. It is a great restaurant for entertaining customers or a group of friends. My kids also love going to The Yard for the food and games. Parking can be a challenge. 

I'm surprised that their rating is not much higher!"}
{"text":"We've been here once before, but for breakfast.  Back then, it was more about the brunch offerings than the grilled cheese sammies.  We enjoyed brunch, so we decided to give it another try for dinner.

Tonight I had the Fried Green Tomatoes Grilled Cheese and the hubby had the Los Pollos Hermanos Grilled Cheese.  Both sandwiches came with tomato soup and while the hubby stuck with the homemade chips, I opted for the fresh cut fries.

The FGT sammie was tasty, but I found myself missing the taste of cheese.  Mostly had the taste of the tomatoes and bacon.  So, for a Grilled Cheese, it didn't hold up for me.  

The LPH sammie was really good.  The chicken was juicy and the combo of the bacon and honey mustard was a win.  However, again, no real cheese flavor to speak of.  Additionally, both sammies were very greasy.  My guess is they get that awesome crunch on the bread using lots of butter.  And who can argue with lots of butter??  So I'm not gonna complain about that.

The fries were really good.  They were fried to perfection and great little dunkers for the obviously homemade tomato soup, which was also very tasty.

Pros:
The food is very tasty
The price is reasonable ($35 before tip for 2 meals and a beer)
The service is top notch

Cons:
During happy hour and on the weekends it can be a bit noisy
The Grilled Cheese sammies don't have much cheese - They should be marketed as unique sandwiches
Parking can be difficult - I know, why bother mentioning anymore.  It's in Market Square Downtown, which everyone knows is not known for parking ease.

All in all, it's a solid sandwich joint in Market Square.  We'll most likely be back again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit to The Yard. We started at the bar as we were waiting for family and ordered wings and a beer flight for starters. Tuesday night beer flight special is a pretty good deal (4- 5 oz pours for $6-7). The wings were cooked perfectly but I wasn't crazy about the honey siracha sauce, it was kind of bland. Once our party was ready we ordered and I went with the Dr. Dobak (short rib, onion rings) and it was very good. My sister in law got the buffalo Mac attack and if I go back, I will be ordering that.. so good. Both the bartender and our waitress were extremely pleasant and informative."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service were 100% recommend on coming here weather with the kids or with friends it's a every friendly place for all"}
{"text":"Anyone who have this place more than 1 star was obviously drunk and not remembering accurate information.
One, good luck parking. The parking is so shitty they have a complimentary valet. Unless you get there at 7:15 apparently and their lots are full so you drive around with everyone else looking for a spot and dodge the police cars waiting for you to park in a no parking residential.
After parking roughly a marathon away, we made it inside.. The place looks super fun, right? Games, young crowd.. Snazzy! Unless you want a drink or to eat something. I met with my SEATED party and waited for our server.. Waited and waited and waited.. Until my fiancé went to the bar and stood in line forever and game back with $10.29 worth of a plastic cup or vodka redbull.. Ummmmmm! Nice! So, one we found out we had a waitress, about 30 minutes into having sat down, we asked for a menu.. 19 minutes later (yes, I time wait staff when I think I'm going to need to complain), she came back with our tables drinks and asked what we had \"we asked for a menu so we could eat..\" Fail.. She came back 14 minutes later and I caught her attention (still no menu), but we had looked online at the menu and gave her our order that way.. And asked for water.. She took my card to start a tab and my food arrived in 20 minutes. I was shocked! But then again, our actual waitress hadn't dropped off the food.. So we had nothing to drink still.. Another 8 minutes passed and I'm almost done with my meal when she walks by and I asked her for the water we ordered.. Ugh!! It wouldn't have been SOOO annoying if she was running around dropping drinks here and there and just busy. The problem was that she said she was busy, but came back to take drink orders while never having anything we asked from her. Why are you taking MORE orders when you cannot even the deliver on the simple requests?! You don't need a bartender to hand you a menu.. Anyway, oops off topic..
When I asked her to run my card and end this terrible night, she came back with my receipt and no card. I asked where my card was and she said she already gave it back to me.. Noooooo.. She said \"I always return them once I swipe them and I gave it back to you\" I replied with \"How could you have given it back to me when I haven't even SEEN you all night?!?\" She went to look for it and would you have guessed she had it and asked me if I was Connie or Jamie.. I should have taken the other persons card and went to the manager to complain that they just hand your card back to strangers.. But alas, I was tired and annoyed and after that I couldn't even give her a pity tip.. DONE!!! 
In short (haha), this could be a BADASS place, but the service is SOOO shitty you had better show up already drunk in order to not care that you're being treated like shit.. 
Also, when I checked in and made a comment about service, all of my friends also had a personal horror story.. So sad.. Such a waste of a cool idea!!!"}
{"text":"Love this. Have been here twice. It's busy place. If you have a big party I would suggest reservations.
It's a laid back place with plenty of food options. Love the outdoor cornhole and ping pong."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas, brunch, and grilled cheese. Need I say more?! My friends and I came here on a Sunday morning and enjoyed good food, good service, and an awesome atmosphere. Although I think the prices for a grilled cheese is a bit on the expensive side, $15 for bottomless mimosas is an awesome deal. They have a large selection of beers and a pretty large bar with multiple televisions. Everyone should try this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! My friends and I always sit at the bar and get great service from Coty, Jen, and Zack! Love me some pretzels beer and monkey bread and I can burn it all off with a game of ping pong or cornhole after! always a good time here."}
{"text":"So happy they opened a Yard at the Galleria! The decor is very cool, and the service was very good! The food there is always yummy, the only reason I left one star out is I do think they use a bit too much butter. Some of the food, ie the bread on the grilled cheese is a bit too greasy for me, but still delicious! The sweet potato fries are also great, the cinnamon butter they bring with it is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"They do a pretty good job \"manufacturing\" fun for those who typically don't have the ambition or wherewithal to generate some on their own.  Good restaurants and a safe bet to hold your next office party.  Also, the parking/valet situation is a mess."}
{"text":"This place is primarily a bar- not a restaurant.  If you wish to dine, stay away from here.  The music is way too loud as is the restaurant.  My companion and I hasd dinner meals (beef stroganoff and fried chicken.)  We asked for bread and the waiter brought it with oil (I prefer butter.)  There were 4 slices of ciabatta.  We asked for additional bread and he told us that there would be a $2.00 charge, which I found outregeous.  The food was less than mediocre.  The following day, both os us woke up with a bad case of diaherrea.  Neded I say more?????????????"}
{"text":"The shadyside spot is still my favorite but this is a pretty cool vibe right here in the south hills!
Tons of beers on tap in heavy rotation, and the styles and tastes are wide ranging ( not 18 different IPAS)
The grilled cheese is their go-to, but their other food is really pretty good.
Great place to meet for happy hour or Sunday games
Nice big bar and a great space in the galleria where the old Mark pi's Chinese restaurant was."}
{"text":"I was told this place was amazing and to go try it. It was a 45 minute wait to get a table and before we sat down we're told that they needed the table back for another reservation at 2pm. Uhh OK?

Ordered the unlimited mimosa and bloody Mary for $33. The first drinks were great while we were waiting for a table. The 2nd drinks and 3rd were much less alcohol. At point my date got a glass of just Orange juice. The bloody Mary bar was missing pepper, hot sauce, and salt. Still very good bloody Mary.

After 15 minutes we finally got to order the grilled cheese sandwiches. They were great coming out pretty quick and hot. Surprised how greasy they were but I didn't mind as much as my date.

Nobody here seems to know what's going on, we were asked 3 times if we paid for the drinks already or not. I was honest but it would have been easy to get them for free."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place and really loving it, but was highly disappointed. Bartenders were unattentive, and that is actually being polite. Sat at the bar, which may have had 10 people seated, boyfriend went to restroom, returned, and we continued to sit for an additional 8minutes before even being greeted. Began to order a few things, that were on the menu, and the bartender was looking at us like we were from another planet and said \"did u even see that on the menu?\" Uhm. Rude. I could go on with the disappointment but hoping my experience is better next time, if there is a next time."}
{"text":"The open space, the ambience, the buzz - there is so much to love about this place. Always have a great time when I go with my friends. The food and beer are a little bit expensive. However, the salmon dish with asparagus and risotto is delicious and I don't mind paying more for that."}
{"text":"My family and I went yesterday for late lunch. We were seated right away. Our server was helpful and friendly. I ordered shrimp lettuce wraps and they were really good. My husband got the Yard burger and liked it too. It's a big burger. My kids got Mac n cheese and a kid's burger from the kid's menu. Both were pretty good and came with fries. They also gave the kids crayons and placemats you can write on so very kid friendly. They serve great coffee! The server said it's Allegheny coffee. We were very pleased with everything except the food came out very quickly. We had just received our coffee and a minute later, our food was there. It wasn't bad for us because we have to eat quickly with 3 little kids but if I wasn't with kids, it would be way too quick. Not a big deal though and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a sports bar, but today's visit was less than pleasant. Our waitress couldn't be bothered and acted like we were bothering her by being sat in her section. She seemed angry and was curt for no reason. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"I this place was highly recommended by my cousin who lives in the city, and since I'm from Cleveland I took her advice. We were disappointed on more than one level. The service was horrible when we went for Sunday brunch. The waiter got the orders wrong and we had to remind him several times about having certain items that were ordered. The bills were also messed up several different times we had to get a manager to sort them out. It was not that complicated with just grilled cheese and beverages. I had a higher expectations for the food, since I love grilled cheese and they just fell short. 

The bottomless Mimosa's were tasty though. Maybe we caught them on an off day. The vibe in the restaurant was nice and I'd give them one more shot the next time I'm back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying... I will have to give this place another shot. I came in last night for the first time. It was \"slow\" because everyone was out watching the ufc fight. Apparently slow means closing early even with over 100 people in your place on a saturday night. 
The atmosphere was wonderful, the staff was friendly. I sat for about 20 minutes plus before someone came by to check on us. At no point throughout the  night could I figure out how service was supposed to work there. 
Pros: 
Great atmosphere
Dj was awesome
Friendly staff
Entertaining games

Cons: 
Mandatory valet. (Immediately a con for me. My truck is older than I am and I don't want anyone handling her without me) 
Confusing service standards
Limited menu
Hyper-trendy food (not necessarily a con, but what if i just wanted something simple\")
Only one entrance/exit (i had to lap the entire building looking for it since I didn't valet) 
 Over all, I did not enjoy my experience last night but I bet if I give it another shot I will. Stay posted for an updated review."}
{"text":"The yard is a great happy hour spot! They've got the right drinks and small plates at the right prices. The meatloaf sandwich is a must try! We sat at the bar, which was really busy, but service was great! 

It's a fun-feeling restaurant. You can see people playing games, and there is lots of open space."}
{"text":"I love the yard! TONS of choices on the menu and service was really friendly. I got the krabby patty and it was delicious! I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Really fun place to go!  We go here a lot for Sunday brunches or just weekend day fun and drinking.  The outside area is huge and really fun.  Lots of games including bag toss, shuffle board, ping pong, and foosball. They have lots of TVs; if I wanted to have a game on in the background this would be a great place although I wouldn't really want to watch my team's games here just becasue of the noise/sound level of TV and sizes of the TV.  They have a few fire pits wtih comfy chairs and couches.  This is a great place for groups of friends and get togethers.  It would probably be good for after work events too.  The food is pretty dang good (its the Culinary Dropout if you have been to the one in old town Scottsdale).  I normally recommend and rave over the pretzel and fondue although the last few times it has been good but not quite as amazing (still worth trying).  I haven't ate at the seafood place that also is joined to it."}
{"text":"For obvious reasons to the people who have been here, this is basically like an arcade for adults mixed in with food and alcohol. For the money, the food is not something I yearn for.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good burger or sandwich, but not when it's an 11 or 14 dollar burger. Alcohol shares the same \"premium\" price as the food. 

Also, for whatever reason they are not open very late (midnight on weekends, 10pm weekdays). This would really be a nice \"after hours\" spot. Albeit Fox RC goes against the grain. The place would have so much more to offer if they'd just stay open later and lower prices slightly."}
{"text":"I CANNOT believe this place only has 3 stars!!!  My husband and I LOVE this place.  It is casual, fun, flexible.  We have gone for date night if we are feeling spunky, we've happy houred with friends, we've brought out of towners straight from the airport for drinks and the yard games, we've celebrated a friend's birthday in the couch area with drinks and apps.  The possibilities are ENDLESS!  The only negatives - expect to valet (it's complimentary, you just tip) and the service can be slow in the bar area - but you are right next to the bar and they've never had an issue with us just walking up and asking for more drinks or apps or whatever.  The food is bomb.  Pretzel fondue, fried chicken, fish and chips, turkey pastrami sandwich, and all the antipasti.  Drinks are yum too - Banjo Strum, Bells and Whistles, After School Special, and don't forget the brown bag special (where they just put whatever canned beer in a brown bag and bring it out - usually if you are nice the waiter will give you a hint if it's worth your while) and the mystery tap.

They have live music on weekend nights - which is SUPER loud - but SUPER fun if you are looking to get pumped up.  Yard games are always a hit and the supplies come in a cute tackle box; presentation is everything right?!

Another plus - the bathrooms!  They are kind of crazy!  They have two separate doors for Women and Men, but share the same sink area, which is decorated with full length mirrors and Ball Jars for soap dispensers!"}
{"text":"To be honest I think the grilled cheese is a little bit on the expensive side so I recommend eating here on Mondays for the special (1/2 off grilled chese from 7pm-10pm).

I've only had two different grilled cheese sandwiches here the Wake & Bake and the Mac Attack. Both are different in the types of ingredients in the sandwich go but I loved the Mac Attack as it was perfect to dip in the mini tomato soup. Beer selection is great as they have plenty of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese for days. Eaten here a few times now. Had the Mac attack, pierogie, and blarney stoner before. All good but pricey. $12-13 for fancy grilled cheese, chips, and tomato soup. Service usually slow but they are busy. I download an app to make a reservation. But I tried to change it and wouldn't work. I then tried to call the business directly but the voice mail was full. No actual person answers the phone."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! The yard was a great place to grab a drink after our meal. We had a blast!"}
{"text":"I organized a work event here for about 25 people and started working with Alexia on it a few months ago.  She was super accommodating to help us achieve the event we wanted by being able to customize the menu and drink options. We had a reserved area out by the bags boards with several large tables set up for us.  Two waitresses took care of the group but there were several other staff who were THE most attentive staff people I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  Filling waters, cleaning up a broken glass, clearing finished plates, and more - they really made us feel cared for!  We all really enjoyed our set menu for the evening which was two different appetizers, a choice of 4 (I think) entrees, and a few desserts.  Before and after eating, everyone had a blast playing bags and shuffle board, and just standing around mingling.  I don't know what The Yard is like for a regular pop-in dinner, but I do have to say that for an event like this we couldn't have asked for anything better.  Truly a memorable experience!  (and sadly it was SO fun I didn't even take pictures!)"}
{"text":"Love the new location.  Raphael was such a great bartender/server.  Super nice and attentive.  We split the Mother of Dragons and Mac Attack and both were awesome.   Oh, get the Cajun seasoning on the fries, it's legit.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I kind of feel like the food is overrated... I have been here many times, the service is hit or miss. I don't care how cool the atmosphere is... it's about the basics good food, good service.

Meh.

We only really come here if we have a big work group in town."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the Weird layout, and having to wait standing on the stairs for the hostess to seat you it'd be 5 stars. I have a lot of food restrictions and through the loud noise the waitresses listen and get me what I need. Foods really good, drinks are strong."}
{"text":"The Yard is a super fun place if you like good food, good drinks and games with your friends.  It can be tough to get a table on the patio at times, as this place can get pretty busy.  And getting a drink at the bar, can be a reallllly long wait.  But if you persevere, you can have a great time.  Get a few people together and play bags, ping pong, shuffleboard or foosball.  On my most recent visit we had a table and a great server who actually came to our table about every 7-8 minutes... We also got lucky and intercepted a group returning their bags so we got to play for a bit.  
I'm a fan of The Yard and excited to check out their new location in Tempe soon!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Korean Ribeye, sautéed onions, mushrooms, zucchini, in  Korean marinade.

But the best part I think is dinning in Phoenix. Here it is the middle of April and we are eating outside at 9 o-clock, wouldn't be doing that back in Milwaukee."}
{"text":"The Yard in the city it's worth the trip for brunch. They have a nice little set up for a bloody Mary bar and also champagne mimosas. They have an offering of some brunch specials on Sunday. I got the sausage biscuits and gravy, tater tots and bacon. My meal was a bit cold and I asked the server if she could have the kitchen warm it up, she returned with a brand-new bowl full of food with extra sausage gravy and extra hot. I was thankful. My husband had the fried green tomato grilled cheese with a roasted red pepper aioli and greens. It came with a side of tomato soup. There are a lot of complaints about the tomato soup, I don't know what they are complaining about, it's not canned Campbell's, it's homemade and it's delicious. The interior is pretty cool, nice bar set up, nice comfy seats, and TVs for all of you sports fanatics."}
{"text":"If you went here when it wasn't packed, I might have a different opinion. #1, I don't like to fight to find parking. There are too many other establishments that offer ample parking. #2, I do not like to scrounge to find a seat. This is a \"Yuppy\" hang out and screams \"look at me, I'm here too!\" 

The drinks are fine and the food is your average mix. There are many outdoor things like Corn Hole to partake in.The staff are friendly and quite efficient. The noise level is high and depending on where you are sitting, it can be difficult to converse.

I'll give it a shot at another point when it is not the weekend or a Friday night. They do offer Valet Parking, so that you don't have to walk 3/4's of a mile from your car. You form your own opinion. It could be that you like riding the subway in New York or standing in a jammed packed elevator too.

{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Definitely get the deviled eggs!!! The grilled cheese is really good. Service was good. Would come back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I ought to give the only a single star, but I can't - I'm probably biased because I like the Scottsdale location so much (which says a lot, because I tend to stay in Central Phoenix). You know... I love Sam Fox, and I'm a fan of the menu of Culinary Dropout. When I learned his newest venture was arriving in my neighborhood and was going to include an AWESOME yard with cleverly fashioned lawn and table games...  AND include the live music element, I was 1000% down with getting at the front of the line of patrons. The menu and beer variety is, as expected, fantastic! I love that they have Moose Drool; usually canned, but sometimes on tap. Their mussels are a particular favorite of mine, and the meatloaf is positively perfect when in the mood for comfort. Their live music performances are great and the general soundtrack is good enough to inspire an unconscious shimmy in your seat. There's so much I love about elements of The Yard that I want to love The Yard. The Yard is kind of like that one guy I dated way back when who left me disappointed and wanting more from him but he never cared back enough to act like he cared. And, like way back when, I keep coming back to The Yard, and find myself increasingly disappointed and frustrated by a service element that doesn't seem to care enough to act like they care. The servers are so hit or miss. I can get a friendly one who can't expedite an order in an appropriate time element or servers who, despite being begged (with a pre-tip) to not forget us, abandon our tables and ignore near-desperate attempts to capture their attention. I'm getting tired of talking to shift managers and receiving what are looking to be empty regrets for our service experiences because the too-cool-to-care demeanor and too-busy-to-pay-attention aloofness of the servers and hosts is wearing me thin. I love My CenPho neighborhood because the eclectic, fun, quirky food personalities are so cool they care. What I perceive to be my biggest complaint about this place is it comes down to I just don't feel welcomed or appreciated at The Yard. I think I need to, in my mind, break up... Because apparently, to The Yard, we were never a thing. ***I will say, like the unattainable, too-cool-for-me guy, there is something redemptive: the bartenders are social, efficient, and cool. AND Mekaela (I'm sure I spelled her name wrong) is a server who is as sweet as she is petite and cute, and she will aim to give you a happy, lively, and attentive service experience. So, this is this my attempt toward an effective \"golden sandwich\" review. Positive truth -truth - positive truth. ... ... ... I should add, I'm writing this review as I wait at the bar for another table. I just WANT to love The Yard.... Okay, after a brief pause writing this to start that dinner with friends....  our dinner finished, and I figured out, like that too-cool guy, one we pay out, we aren't likely to see a server again.

IMHO... unless they figure out the service element and Fox Restaurant Concepts learns from the feedback of their customers, Mr. Fox may want to consider staying in Scottsdale and letting Upward Projects, Mule & the Delaney Bros, and Jeff Fischer have Central Phoenix...."}
{"text":"The Yard. I like the name! 
A few friends and I went here for brunch one Sunday morning. They had a fun little Bloody Mary bar with all kinds of toppings you could mix in! It looked cute, but I didn't partake in the fun. I did stare at people (totally not in a creepy way) as they made their combinations. 

The grilled cheese menu look amazing! It reminded me of Melt in Cleveland, OH with all the calories and glory that cheese brings!

Since we were there for brunch, I chose to get an Eggs Benedict. It was pretty tasty, but the hollandaise sauce seemed to disappear as it sat on my eggs, like it was there but as it became room temperature it didn't hold up to the creamy texture it should have. I don't know what that means, maybe not enough egg yolk? Maybe not enough sauce? Everyone's else food was good too I mean nothing to talk too much about I guess. I'd come here again for brunch, but I might try something else... and get a Bloody Mary lol

Our waitress was very friendly and the hostess greeted us pleasantly! 

The bathroom, could use some improvements, especially for how nice the rest of the restaurant is. You have to walk past the kitchen to get to the bathroom, which is kind of fun because you can see if it's clean or not lol *It's clean!"}
{"text":"Dear grilled cheese...I want to love you, I really do...but I just don't.  The thing about the grilled cheese list is that it LOOKS fantastic.  I love grilled cheese and always get excited about the options at The Yard.   The problem is that they simply fail to deliver.   I don't know what it is, but I've had 5 different varieties now and none of them have lived up to the hype on the menu.   

There are a few things I like about the Yard though, so it gets a middle of the road review from me.   What I like: 
- Happy Hour.   Anytime I can get a $4 glass of wine downtown, I am down.    
- The beer list.  I don't drink beer, but my beer-snob friends love the selection at The Yard.    
- The sides.   I did actually enjoy some of the sides (the mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, and Caesar salad).   

Pro tip:  If you are going to try a grilled cheese, it's well worth it to swap out BOTH the chips (overcooked most of the time) and tomato soup (just so-so in my book).   You can do the upcharge to select alternatives to both, which wasn't super clear on the menu, but has worked every time I have gone.   The Caesar Salad is huge, so if you are going that route with a substitution, I'd recommend splitting or taking leftovers.    

A couple of other things to know: 
- You have to go up a flight of stairs to get in there, so it isn't for the very elderly, injured, etc.  
-  It is crazy loud in there.  If you are looking for conversation, the bar is probably easier than the tables.  At the tables, you have to shout when it's crowded.    
- The bathroom is in the back - past the food window and a bunch of kegs and up a ramp.  It appears to be an afterthought inside and out."}
{"text":"Primanti Bros can suck it!  The Yard House is hands DOWN the BEST FOOD in the Burgh!  I have been all over the U.S.  and this may have been my best meal ever! I had the Frank in the Tank and the AMAZING mac n cheese -  super delicious! Lindsay was fabulous and I am so happy we found this beautiful nugget of love in market square!"}
{"text":"The only downfall? It's too darn popular! Seriously, there's a part of me that wishes nobody knew about this place so I could have all the games and fun to myself. Sadly (but luckily for them), this is not the case. The Yard is like the most popular kid in school: always surrounded and nearly impossible to steal away. The entire outdoor area is filled with every game imaginable, horseshoes, cornhole, ping pong... you name it they've got it. The inside is a booming Culinary Dropout with the delicious drinks and live music that they are so well known for. 

Pros: 

- Great atmosphere
- Fun games 
- Live music 
- Housemade cocktails and local brews 
- Brown bag beers 
- Yummy food 

Cons 

- Parking. Valet fills up and if they can't accommodate you, you will need to park in one of the neighboring parking lots, but pay attention because they will ticket you if you park in a no parking zone. 

- It's incredibly crowded and nearly impossible to actually get play any of the games without a long wait."}
{"text":"I randomly happened into 'The Yard' during happy hour on a Thursday. My mission was an in between class drink.  I thought I had heard some positives about the place but I'm guilty of believing my own half-truths. The beer selection was mostly local but it seems as if it's mostly off season(slightly). It is February but seeing Christmas beer on the menu told me right away that this place is for a different crowd. A crowd made of mostly suburbanites and out of touch downtowners looking for an after work burger and beer. I'm not that. Maybe you aren't either...? 
This place isn't awful but it's also not really anything more than an Eat'n Park with beer. The wine selection is very low grade and their cocktails aren't worth noting.
I may continue to frequent here for the $4.50 Rhinegeist Bubbles during happy hour but I'm not sure I want to smell of booze AND frier grease for my evening class."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good, but not ginormous. Food was ok, not great. Fried green tomatoes were a let-down."}
{"text":"Poor lunch.      MAC burger was just that a Big Mac with 19 french fries..   G chicken salad..  Served in a 9\" bowl.  The waitresss quickly said \" it's on the bottom\"  as I looked for the chicken.   Only  1/2 filled with no crackers or bread served with the salad.   And of course we paid the price."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, have been here so many times and I have never been impressed. Concept of the games is cool but if you come on a Friday or Saturday night when it's busy, there's no time limit so the same groups will be on the games all night and it can be impossible to play. Drinks are expensive for what they are. Menu is mediocre at best. The actual place is really cool with the outdoor concept, the seating and layout/decor really saves this place since any time I have brought out of town guests it seems to stand out to them. This place is average but what knocks it down to below average is the terrible/rude service. I was here once a couple of years ago and asked the bartender what his favorite drink was looking for a recommendation. He was super annoyed and said with a huge attitude \"I hate when people ask me this question, your taste could be totally different than mine.\" Oh...ok. Weird way to answer that question to someone obviously looking for some opinions from someone who works there. A couple of weeks ago we came here for a work going away party. As people do, only a certain number of people rsvp'ed so a reservation was made accordingly and then many more people ended up showing up. I totally understand that this is very annoying for the restaurant, but it was happening and out of anyone's control. Instead of just handling it as best as possible, we were made to feel like complete assholes and like we were the biggest inconvenience on the face of the earth. It was so bad a couple of people in our party actually left to try to help us not have so many over he reservation. It was crazy to me that anyone could make their customers feel like that and willingly lose business, especially a large group ordering drinks and dinner that would be racking up a big tab. The employees give off a very trendy, millennial, holier than thou and annoyed at your presence vibe and act accordingly. Not sure if this is just the area as camp social service is similar just not as in your face about it"}
{"text":"Honestly it isn't much to get excited about. I love the concept. When we were there, it wasn't too crowded, so you would think that the food would be really fresh and hot. Well it wasn't. My greens on my sandwich were obviously old and borderline inedible. The fries were fine. I got a sour beer there that I liked, though, so that was nice."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! Great idea for a nice relaxing hang out with friends and family! With the different restaurants to pick from is a nice variety."}
{"text":"Love of my life. I can always count on this place for a great meal, great atmosphere, and the best service. I love every minute of being here."}
{"text":"The yard is a fun place, a playground for adults.  The only problem is the parking, if I lived near I would frequent a lot more so I didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot.  There food is actually really good and they do a great job with their homemade potato chips.  I like that they give you a mystery beer option, kind of a cool idea.  After the meal I went to destroy so other people's hopes that they were good at table tennis.  Great place to watch sports or have a gathering with friends."}
{"text":"Never been here for brunch before- Not a huge fan of their mimosas but their bloody mary's are on POINT! Breakfast burrito was yummy too!"}
{"text":"The Culinary Dropout at The Yard is a fantastic place to enjoy lunch on the patio. The prime rib dip is always tasty, as well as, the truffle chips. There are many games (cornhole, ping pong, giant Jenga) to enjoy before or after food, and even a free photo booth. 
It is not located in the nicest area, but if you find your self near it, it is definitely worth the stop.
See photos."}
{"text":"Drinking, playing Kornhole, table tennis, or sweating it out  next to the big fans in the yard. Food here always tastes better after some beers or cocktails. Great place for dates, meeting up with friends or large groups. First hot day of the year had to do something light for lunch. Felt like a salad, decided on the chicken Gorgonzola. Really was happy with my choice considering this is a better place to drink and hang out than eat. Bottoms up folks come one come all!"}
{"text":"The concept is pretty cool, there is a large outdoor area with games with equipment that you can sign out although there doesn't seem to be an enforced time limit on how long you can keep things so when people decide to hoard equipment there's no telling how long you'll have to wait.  

The food was okay but pricey for what it was and the staff was pretty rude.  There was a sign that said the outdoor area is self serve so we assumed we would need to order from the bar, which was fine until we were rudely corrected by a server who had a small hissy fit when we didn't order through her.  She kept saying she would transfer the bar tab but never did.  The bartender, when asked what beers they had gave us back nothing but snark.  None of the staff wear any kind of uniform either so memorize their faces (or in our case last night, the waitress's boobs because they were literally hanging out of her shirt). 

The bathroom situation is a little odd, co-ed but has separate entrances.  The other silly thing is the parking, there is very little parking available in the area, they do offer complimentary valet (they call it a \"green\" service but there isn't really anything \"green\" about having a line of cars idling for no reason when the drivers could just park themselves and go inside).  

We went with a very large party, the hostess called ahead to try to make reservations and was told they don't accept reservations but when we got there almost every available seating area was reserved.  We found out later that they only take reservations for parties of 10 - no more, no less.  

I wouldn't suggest bringing kids, while the games are kid friendly, masses of drunken adults are not and the place is very crowded.    

I was really torn on how to rate this place, like I said, it's a great concept but the service is just so bad that I just don't think it is a place I would ever want to go back to.  It is good for people watching though."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. I can't wait to come back! I got the cheesy capresey sandwich. It came with tomato soup. It was delicious! I'm usually very picky about grilled cheese sandwiches, but this was so good!

We came in with a larger group at a busy time and had great service. All my friends enjoyed their food as well. 

I also like that they have brunch options and unlimited mimosas. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The menu (a whole page of grilled cheese selections, great appetizer choices, etc.) is exactly my kind of food. I must go back a lot to try the different grilled cheese options. They have a large beer selection and a couple ciders on tap, which was nice, too. The service was wonderful and when we noticed we hadn't received part of what we ordered, they gave us extra to take home to make up for it (totally unnecessary). I'm shocked that they've been open less than a month an everything is already so good. 

The cajun chips were a bit disappointing, since we thought they'd be spicier and even the ones where there was a ton of seasoning on top didn't have a kick. It also seems like they put the seasoning on after the chips have cooled (rather than having a place to make and store each kind of chip immediately), which meant the seasoning fell off easily. I'm still looking forward to trying the other chip options, but I hope they start seasoning them a bit better."}
{"text":"Fun place to grab a drink and hang out with friends.  Great for a large group, for a fun night out with friends, hanging out, playing the games, or just lounging around the comfortable seating."}
{"text":"This place is great. We came with a group of about 40  after a rehearsal dinner. Waitstaff were attentive. Drinks were affordable. The nachos and pretzel cubes were awesome. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"This is a boring restaurant.  The food is average to poor and the decor has become standard restaurant bric a brac.  My salad was just ok and the lettuce lacked flavor.  My steak was simply a piece of meat.  It filled my stomach.  The green beans on the plate tasted plastic.  If you're a foodie, stay away.  If you like standard, produce it any where food then this is your place."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday brunch and had a great experience! The waitress, Rebekah, was so on top of everything and was making sure we got the most of our almost bottomless mimosas! She offered to give us separate checks which was so thoughtful for a big group of girls. The food was yummy and the service was great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We chose The Yard because (a) the menu looked good and (b) the wait for a table was zero minutes.

We started with the buffalo chicken dip, referred to as \"I Dip, You Dip, We Dip,\" which was good, but nothing better than what I've had at Super Bowl parties. The chips that accompanied the dip were your basic restaurant-style tortilla chips. The dish itself was small. The four of us finished it off quickly. We easily could have ordered another appetizer.

I ordered a side salad which included the standard lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber (very large slices of cucumber, I might add). The ranch was the real winner, as it so often is with these types of salads.

For my entree, I went with \"The Wac Arnold,\" which is essentially a patty melt: two beef patties, cheese, special sauce, lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion...all served between two slices of Texas toast.

The patties were much smaller than I envisioned. The cheese disappeared among the mix, and the special sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking.  It wasn't bad, but I definitely wouldn't order it again. The small side serving of fries was more or less forgettable.

The service was great. The restaurant was a bit warm and stuffy (which says a lot coming from this cold-blooded human).

All in all, it was an average experience."}
{"text":"It's Sam Fox.  The food is reliable and maybe a dollar overpriced.  The food (which is Culinary DropOut which is essentially Arrogant Butcher) will not offend or disappoint.  The salads are tasty and as always the pretzels served with cheese fondue is tasty and filling.  Be forewarned that gents, if you were a trendy gingham shirt, you will be mistaken for a member of the staff.  Parking is valet only, (and the entrance a little tricky (on the north side)) but I really don't mind valet.  It keeps guys employed who would otherwise be working fast food.  I like the interior, which is low key with a chandelier here or there.   Truly the reason to be here will the patio.  As other dining establishments open up, I can only imagine that it will become more crowded, but while the weather is nice, you should definitely come on out.  It's a nice change of pace from Vig Uptown, and admittedly the food is a bit tastier.  Just don't come expecting your mind to blown (foodwise) and don't wear gingham shirts."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today at The Yard.  It's new in the Galleria.  Check it out!  Food was delicious!  Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Took too long to check this place out! Hipster? Yes, Trendy? Yes. Overcrowded at times? I'm sure. Hey, that all makes for great people watching. If you are like me, looking to have a few day beers, good food, and bring the kids, this is the spot. The spacious area with all kinds or rec and table games is the key to this place! Waiting for a table, or your food, is no problem here. Table tennis, bags, foosball, and more. The beer menu is solid, and the options at Culinary Dropout are definitely unique, in a good way. The service was friendly, the timing of food and drinks was on point, and all of the food was well prepared. I would like to go back and get the adult version of The Yard on a weekend night. From what I hear we are getting one in Gilbert. That will be an awesome addition to DT Gilbert, cant wait!"}
{"text":"I went because when I searched for gluten free this restaurant came up. They have gluten free bread so they can make the burgers gluten free but there really aren't any sides available. Waited 30 minutes for my burger and my husbands. Mine was raw on the inside and couldn't eat it. My husbands burger wasn't what he ordered. The manager was very apologetic and offered to try and make it right, but we were done. First time ever I have walked out. The manager gave us a gift card but I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"Had wanted to try this place out for a very long time and finally got the chance this past weekend.  The place looks great on the inside.  We were here for dinner, but it would definitely be a fun happy hour spot.  The service was great throughout the night as well.

We ordered the buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and it was very good.  However, for future visits I do not think I would get an appetizer because the main course portions are huge.

My sandwich was called Buffy the mac slayer.  Buffalo chicken with mac and cheese.  Sometimes a sandwich with mac and cheese can turn into a mess quick, however the quality bread they used help it stay together and made for a delicious sandwich.  The home cut fries with their house made ranch were also very good.  You can have your fries topped with different seasonings, I went with Cajun and it was perfect.  I also really liked their tomatoe soup.

My wife had a standard mac and cheese which she thought was pretty good.  My mom had the frank the tank, which was buffalo chicken dip, cheese, and an onion ring.  She wasn't a huge fan, but I thought it was great.  My dad had the wang Chung which is bbq pulled chicken and Asian slaw.  This was probably everyone's least favorite sandwich.

Overall I was very happy with the trip and will definitely be returning to try more of their sandwiches."}

The Yard is an interesting place.  Two different dining experiences; one from what I gather a seafood/oyster restaurant and the other is the Culinary Dropout.  Culinary Dropout I would describe is modern American cuisine.  Great small bites to share so we ordered the pretzel with cheese, bacon with grilled cheese and the mussels.  

The pretzels were soft and doughy while the creamy cheese helped with the chewing process, if you know what I mean.  The bacon and grilled cheese sandwich really worked well together.  That's gonna be my new thing grilled cheese and bacon; why didn't I think of this!  Finally, the mussels with the broth, which I still can't figure what it is...yummy!  Overall my favorite of the night and definitely a recommendation.  

Drinks are pretty pricey, and the games around \"the yard\" are pretty cool.  Ping pong tables, foosball, and corn hole games spread across the place.  It reminds me of an East coast roof top bar feel with the couches and the live band rocking away.  It can get real loud here, but if you can't handle the noise keep your butt at home and enjoy a glass of wine.  In the end, this is the closet thing to a night life in Central area of Phoenix. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The only downside to my visit was the fact that it was INCREDIBLY LOUD, but it was happy hour and of course that means they are doing good business! They have a great menu with a lot of different flavors, so there really is something for everyone. While they market everything as grilled cheese sandwiches, they really are just sandwiches that happen to have cheese and a whole lot of other things on them. Not a bad thing, but if you're looking for a legitimate grilled cheese, you'll have to special order it because they don't have one on the menu!

I had the Mac Attack which is deep fried Mac & Cheese served with a creamy srirachi dipping sauce. So delicious! You really can't go wrong with friend Mac & Cheese. For my sandwich, I chose the \"Pierogies N' At\" because I live in Pittsburgh and pierogis are a regular part of my balanced diet. I requested no kielbasa, so it had gouda, cheddar pierogis and fried onions and French fries. I love the fact that they serve it with a little tomato soup for dipping! The bread was thick and crusty and the filling was great. 

The service was prompt despite the crowd and I would definitely check this place out again--- maybe not during a happy hour since I usually prefer more of a chill atmosphere, but the food would bring me back for sure."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and atmosphere!  Perfect spot for Sunday Football."}
{"text":"The Yard is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! I've been to the other two locations several times, but this was my first visit to this location. We attended with a large group (30) for Saturday morning brunch and were not disappointed. We had the pleasure of sitting in a side room all to ourselves, it was significantly warmer in the room, but that didn't make or break our brunch. The staff was patient with us and very friendly despite there being so many of us. The brunch menu is to die for and everything sounds delicious, it makes ordering difficult - chicken and waffle sliders or snozberry pancakes?! Bottomless mimosas or a boozy coffee beverage?! Overall we had a great group experience at The Yard and are already deciding when we want to visit again!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere,Good food and good appetizer's. Plan on spending time here too take it all in.... Bathrooms are a hoot!! Makes you do a double take, when chicks in there with you. Funny how people use correct door when going out.... Lol!! Fun place to be, gonna be cool when they open the new Yard in Tempe...."}
{"text":"Once was enough. Mom paid $8 (which seems like nothing) for a side of asparagus and one piece of cheese. It was ridiculous and made me sad. Happy hour only applies if you're sitting at a high top table... I was literally two feet from one, yet, did not qualify. What is the difference? I have been to True Food and was seriously disappointed; therefore, did not have high hopes for another fancy Fox Restaurant Concepts establishment. Didn't eat, because I was already let down when we were served by the same waitress who we had the one and only time I visited True Food. She seriously disappointed me when she told my mom she could bring out some crudités, as mom did not want the pita bread that accompanies the hummus. Well, little did we know, the VEGETABLES would be somewhere around $8 on top of the ridiculous amount paid for the hummus. I would rather buy a tub of hummus from Costco, seriously. She could have maybe, well I don't know, mentioned that the side of vegetables would be extra... Anyway, I was not impressed. Especially because there are at least four (4) establishments I can think of on Central Avenue just north of Camelback that offer awesome pitchers of beer for $5 during happy hour.

Also, I came here one Saturday night prior to tonight's visit and was told there would be a two hour wait... HA HA. I want to know what type of people are keeping these places in business. I don't even feel bad about this negative review, as I feel like Fox is seriously ripping people off with every business venture they develop.

Pretzel bites? Ah, that was creative. You forgot sweet potato fries... Don't want to stray too far from the bandwagon."}
{"text":"I love grilled cheese so I really wanted to love it here but there were a few items standing in the way of a four or five star review.   First off, the tomato soup was terrible.   One bite and I couldn't go back for more.  It was waaaayy too thick for my taste....think tomato sauce in a bowl.   

I had the 'smack yo mama' grilled cheese which was pulled bbq chicken, beer cheese and onion straws.  I actually subbed out the onion straws for fries.  The bread was toasted perfectly, and I bit right in to some wonderful flavors.  My only complaint was that twice in the course of my lunch, I bit into hard pieces of gristle that shouldn't have made it anywhere into my sandwich.   By that point I was picking through my chicken so much, I wasn't enjoying it.   

I also had the garlic Parmesan chips with the sandwich.   They were good but I would have liked more flavor.  Lastly, they bring your sandwich, chips and cup of soup out on this little wooden cutting board.  I personally think it's too small to hold everything and was struggling to cut my sandwich in half without knocking stuff off the board. 

Regardless, they did a good job on redoing the space.  It's still an overall awkward space but it was much more comfortable and inviting than the last restaurant in the space."}
{"text":"I've never tried this location and was pleasantly surprised! It was only moderately busy and service was fast! I came her for brunch with my friends and while the food was great, the service made the experience much better. Ryan, our server, was funny and we loved him! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how to rate The Yard. I REALLY like the concept and while it has an unusual layout, it's nonetheless a fun place to come hangout to drink, perhaps grab a bite and then take in some live music while trying to play ping pong when you've got a good buzz going (\"Hit the one in the middle, Rock!\")

I came here for brunch and had a decent French Dip at Culinary Dropout. The dining experience was all just OK. 

So I think what I'm trying to say is Four Stars for concept, idea, atmosphere plus Two Stars for less than great food and service averages out to Three Stars.

Our main server was actually very friendly and enthusiastic but his colleagues in charge of bringing our drinks in a timely manner left a lot to be desired. I had a Prime Rib dip which was good but memories of Philippe in Downtown L.A. and even the French Dip at Chelsea's Kitchen ensured that the Prime Rib dip here did not measure up. As with most Fox Restaurants the dessert was out of the park so well done there.

I will definitely return to The Yard and would recommend it but it's with the understanding that you probably won't be blown away by the food and the service may not be completely up to par (hopefully once the business is more established the service will improve). This is one of those places where you'll take a hit on the food and service so you can enjoy a fun, unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Yard is somewhat of a local hangout spot that carries two different vibes depending on when you are there.  Though it can definitely be a bit overwhelming upon your first visit, here's what might help.

What to do:
Well you have two different vibes as stated before.  We have been there during different functions and capacities.  Date nights, late evening friends hang, for brunch with kids.  You have three main restaurants there.  Culinary Dropout, Little Cleo's (only open for dinner), both from the Fox restaurants group and Barrio Urbano, a James Beard Foundation nominated restaurant.  You will have to valet your wheels unfortunately or find a spot to park in the local neighborhood, which could take you forever. You will be greeted by a few greeters as you enter The Yard, you'll have to let them know where you're planning on dining.  Which if it's your first time, just let them know you need to check it all out first... CD gets very busy around the evening with swanky locals grabbing drinks and appetizers sitting in an outdoor living room style area lined with ping pong tables, corn hole and adirondack chairs.  During brunch/lunch it's quieter, if you have kids, it's totally doable, you can sit out there and they can run around on the turf.  At night, don't bother to bring the little ones. Want ping-pong paddles and bags for cornhole?  They'll take hostage your Driver's license for those.  Just don't leave without it and return the goods!  

Why go there:
Culinary Drop out is great for brunch/lunch offerings, at night it seems most people just get apps and drinks and can sit there forever due to Phoenix' outstanding weather.  It's a good vibe, great to meet up with friends and enjoy some good food.  Little Cleo's is a nice little seafood spot, if you'd like to experience oysters and don't know where to go, this is a good place to start, they have an array that you could try out, per the oyster.  Their offerings are tasty and fairly well portioned for their price.  People go to the Yard to sit and have a longer than normal grazing session.  Something folks in Phoenix are learning to do better. The place will make you feel like you're in a different city for the moment.

Tips: Make reservations if you have large parties, be prepared to just go with the flow, this place is full most of the time.  Try to sit anywhere outside on premises and take in the feel of what is surely unique in the valley. Don't expect the greeters to be super friendly, they are never the same for some reason, rarely smile and don't seem to like kids.  But that's not why you go there, GM's are around make sure you let them know about your experience!

Don't miss:
Little Cleo's Happy Hour is good, get there early and graze.  Their warm jar of King Crab in butter is delicious.  Worth every penny.  You may need extra bread to catch all that buttery goodness when the crab is gone. Oh and bathrooms are pretty awesome, stylish and a bit confusing, you will know what I mean, check them out."}
{"text":"Was here for a friend's birthday party and have a nice time.  Service was very good, so were the drinks.  Didn't have a chance to eat, so I can't rate the food.  Something odd though - when I went to the valet to get my car... 2 Phoenix cops were sitting in their Tahoe watching everyone that came out.  I felt very uncomfortable.  I was by no means drunk and was perfectly fine to drive... but having them outside... just waiting for someone to sneeze or cough or perhaps trip on a curb... was weird.  I didn't like that I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong when I had done nothing wrong.  Just sayin'."}
{"text":"If you want any beer you could possibly think of this is your place. The bartenders can pretty much tell you a little something about all of them too. They know their beer. They have a large selection of vegetarian options too with all their mock chicken substitutions."}
{"text":"Fun place. Good bar food. My server was great. There was live music. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"WTH???

I usually like The Yard. They HAD favorite beer, Blue Paddle.  Not everyone likes every beer on draught to be an IPA....so I picked another lager.  But then the cheese plate came out. My friend asked if half of it fell off? We asked if bread was coming out. Nope, would like to order a side of bread too.

I posted a picture of my cheese plate."}
{"text":"The Yard has everything you want from a dinning experience. It has an upscale trendy vibe, good customer service, unique drinks, live entertainment, and probably what you came for which is the huge open air patio space.  

An example of a night: First thing before you get there is expect a wait as it usually is pretty packed during the weekend. Also the parking lot is valet only. There are three restaurants at this location. I have ate at culinary dropout (for a different review) but not at either of the other two. We came for drinks so got a drink menu and there are a lot of unique choice. Tried a  couple and all where very good. There was a live band that was playing on a Friday night so that was pretty cool.  Afterwards you can go back to the front and exchange your ID for some ping pong paddles or cornhole.  There was a slight wait time for games/tables but nothing terrible. It was surprisingly very clean on the patio and everyone seemed to having a fun time. No one was super serious or obnoxious and was a fun time. Recommend for trips out with friends or coworkers to unwind and play some games and have a couple drinks. Will come back."}
{"text":"i think NOT. First off, I live downtown. This is pretty close to me.  With that being said, there is a reason why I had never stopped in there, until the bff wanted to have her birthday party there. I agreed of course, trying to be open minded. Now, picture this. I am in a short tight dress, at night, and after circling the parking lot 100 times, realize I get to park ACROSS 7th St. Guess what that means? I get to run across 7th St in 4 inch heels dodging cars trying not to break an ankle! Not a good way to start the evening. After making it across all lanes alive, I enter into a beyond packed restaurant. It was like sardines in there Im not even kidding. It was so hot, and I could barely move. I did not like the vibe, too fufu for me (I know that's not proper lol). The food was overpriced, and nothing sounded appealing. So for dinner I decided to keep it classy and have a tall can of Budweiser  :) of course that was over priced too, but you cant ruin a Bud! I would not return here, and don't get what the hype is over this place. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Went there recently, our male server really didnt seem to want to serve 2 men (more interested in the women at other tables), not friendly at all. used a credit card that i NEVER use, next day someone spent $800 with my credit card nbr. I cant for sure connect the two but other options to where my number could be taken... VERY SLIM. Just check ur statements."}
{"text":"Went to \"The Yard\" at Culinary Dropout at night. Place had plenty of open tables (inside and outside) yet the hostess, and the server, both refused to seat our group of 8-10 people as we \"couldn't commit to full meal orders\". This was at 10pm by the way.... 
Won't be bringing any large groups by here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food's decent albeit overpriced (welcome to FRC). Service is mediocre. High staff turnover. Vibe is ok. But a bit pretentious"}
{"text":"Just got together with some friends to have appetizers and drinks. There is a nice beer list, and the drinks were good. Enjoyed the appetizers, specifically...The balls. Try the balls they are delicious. 

I got a grilled cheese that was pretty good. I like the Market Square location too. The only thing keeping this from the fourth star was the fact that it was an 85° day outside and if there was air conditioning at all then it was maybe cooling the inside temp down to 83°. 

Eventually had to leave to cool off."}
{"text":"As many people have said The Yard is a great concept but they have some serious kinks to work out! Parking is crazy, the wait times are unreal, slow service, reservations...do they take them or not?? I was told no but see reserved signs on the tables so maybe they should have more consistent rules??? They advertise as kid/family friendly but they are NOT!!. We have been there several times and it has been fun but definitely over priced to say the least. The food is okay but I think $200 to go out with your hubby for dinner and drinks is way too much. 

Our most recent visit was a Saturday morning, we decided to come here with some other families from our sons baseball team for brunch. It started out with the kids being told they couldn't play any games without a parent present, even though we were sitting on the patio in a table right next to The Yard area. So, no biggie, I went out there with them and was greeted by Jason, The Yard Nazi. We checked out a couple ping pong sets and a bean bag set for the kids to play with. After a bit my son accidentally dropped one of the paddles(and yes, I witnessed this) and it completely FELL APART, not broke, fell apart. I'm not sure where they buy their equipment but it has got to be the cheapest stuff possible to buy. Of course Jason, The Yard Nazi, was right there to come and tell us \"It is free to use but if you break it you have to pay for it\", the key word here is \"break\". The paddle literally fell apart and he didn't slam it on the ground or throw it, he just dropped it. I was then informed we would have to pay $10 to replace it. Needless to say I was not happy about paying $10 for a paddle that fell apart. When my husband spoke to Jason about this he was told he was wrong, it is broken. So much for the customer is always right :/ Then when we went to turn in the paddles we couldn't find the ball and we had to pay $1 for that too, a dollar! For a ping pong ball that probably cost $.05 at most! Another family had to pay for a ball because it was cracked. Maybe it was cracked when they got it? Who knows, but I don't think that family will be back again either. They areballs made of plastic not titanium, they are going to break eventually with normal wear and tear. Jason, you need to get a life! 

They need to decide if this is a kid/family friendly place or an adult place. The way they walk around the yard area and yell at the kids for every little thing just does not make for a \"friendly\" atmosphere. Or maybe make family hours and adult hours when kids aren't aloud so those people who don't want to play the games with kids along side them can come during adult time. Something need to change or this place isn't going to survive and after reading the other reviews I'm not the only one who feels this way."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday night. Relatively quiet night. Was surprised at the crowd when we first arrived, but does down. We just had drinks and desert. We did have to wait way too long for a server, and ended up just going to the bar to get our own drinks. 

It's a nice little place. Nothing amazing. I'm not a child, so games don't really excite me. The couches were terribly uncomfortable. Once we had a waitress, she was very nice."}
{"text":"We came here for a Sunday Funday, except I had missed the memo and was in an inexplicable Sunday Funkday. Never deterred, my inner 5 year old gave in to the games and I ended up having a fantastic time!

We started off at Culinary Dropout to watch a football game. The interior is bright, floor to ceiling glass, and modern.  We may have been a bit early, but the atmosphere inside wasn't sports bar pandemonium and hysteria that is contagious. In other words, I had nobody to trash talk with except for my companion - and that gets old.  There's an outdoor seating area that seemed more lively. This could be a great stop to have brunch, get amped for football by playing games and unleashing the competitive ferocity that only comes out during heroic games of PING PONG, FOOSBALL, AND CORNHOLE.  Then, glumly slink to the nearest sports bar to watch real athleticism and drink your glory days away."}
{"text":"The food here is great and I love the concept but the bartenders are HORRIBLE!! They are rude and don't know how to make drinks... When I asked for a manager I was basically ignored until I pushed to speak to one... Wouldn't recommend for a night out"}
{"text":"way to noisy. me and husband could not even hear one another. too much hype for a grilled chz where my cheese was not even melted- so much for that being there specialty- disappointing"}
{"text":"Loved this place. It was a bit pricey but every drink I tried and all the food I ate was so good! I highly recommend the pastrami sandwich, the pretzel and cheese dip is so yum! And the fried chicken. 
I tasted every drink that didnt have gin and they were all A plus plus! The games are fun as well, but you have to be willing to go up to a table and ask for next game or sometimes you will stand there for an hour with no one moving."}
{"text":"Food was good, people were friendly. Good place to come on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I decided to go with some friends and watch the cardinals game. Had a pretty good experience especially with our very cool waiter Cody.  Very nice gentleman and funny. Loved the service and the food. I will come here again and again. Had a blastttttttttttt"}
{"text":"Good thing our sever is nice! The guy seating people at the front door is an Ass!!! Not that many people and all we asked was to sit outside. No need to be rude."}
{"text":"I got the Yard Walker chicken sandwich with Cajun chips and tomato soup.  I also had an Old and New cocktail.  It was all great!  Atmosphere is like being in a SanDiego rooftop bar.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love it! Fantastic open air space to enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather. This is Phoenix living at its best! They could use more drink specials for happy hour though."}
{"text":"We stopped in the Yard over Thanksgiving break with family. My parents were excited to bring us in since someone we went to grade school with is one of the owners. I have to say it's quite a great concept.

Grilled cheese, comfort food, sports, great service and beers galore! Our server, Wayne, was just fantastic and he explained to us that he's been around for almost all of the openings of the Yard. Their service was great - we saw about 5-7 different people throughout the meal refilling our drinks or clearing plates. Usually, you always have to wait for your server, but it was a very good team approach to their service model.

Since it was our first time in, we figured we had to try the grilled cheese, but they have other items then grilled cheese! The menu items had rather creative names too! I had the \"Big Che-bowski\" on gluten free bread. Couldn't have been happier that they had gluten free bread. We also started with the buffalo chicken dip with the creative name \"I dip, you dip, we dip\". The chicken dip was served with corn tortillas too. The staff was knowledgeable or will ling to find out which items were safe for gluten free people and which were not.

The grilled cheese comes with two sides, and there's a variety of items that you can upgrade to for a small charge. My husband had the mac and cheese and said it was just as amazing as others had told us.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Just that. The prices are a bit steep for the quality of food. The drinks are not worth the price either. They were weak and it took 30 minutes for a waitress outside to even acknowledge us. Apparently if you don't dress like a rich snob your money isn't good enough for them. I will take my money somewhere else that has better parking, better food and better service"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! Games to play! Beer to drink! Food to eat! NOM! NOM! Get in my Belly!! They have misters to keep you cool which is a MUST in AZ!"}
{"text":"Bro this place is so popping!!! Out guy was shmiddty who got out drinks and food and this service was unbelievable!! It felt like he was one of our boys!!! Mind you Ima barber I know what good service is and should be and this was about ten points over!! Great place food was amazing!! The beer was amazing!! Found my new hang out spot!!"}
{"text":"Very cool setup with plenty of room however the wait staff seems to have trouble serving everyone. I was there on a not busy Wednesday night. Our waitress rarely showed up, then brought my entire group of 12 ONE bill without ever asking if we wanted to separate...very annoying. The drink prices are pretty high too."}
{"text":"Unique concept!  I really like it by the layout is a little confusing.  PIng pong tables, picnic tables, reserved areas, bar area, free for all areas, and just a cluster.  

You must valet or good luck and find a place to park within a 1 mile of this place.  We got our names on the list for a 45 min wait.  Straight to the bar!  Hardly a spot to get to the bar to order.  One of us got to the bar and ordered for everyone.  Grab our drinks and found a free for all area to crash.  Ordered the soft pretzels & provolone fondue app.  SO SO SO SO GOOD.  It was very loud too.  Almost felt like I needed to text my friends to communicate with them.  

Finally got in for the table.  It was right next the kitchen.  Awesome!  But within 10 mins of sitting at the table the live band started to play.  They were good but SO LOUD.  Impossible to carry a conversation at all.  I ordered the fried chicken (3 pieces of perfectly fried chicken with honey lightly drizzled on top, a freaking awesome biscuit, and a tiny scope of mash potatoes.  But the servers were great!

Boiled down to:  FOOD 5 stars; concept 5 star; & 1 stars for enjoying the company of your fellow eaters.  Felt like I ordered food and was like eating by myself at a concert.  WHAT?  HOW IS YOUR FOOD?  WHAT?  Our conversions!"}
{"text":"Was really loud for Brunch. Not sure if the Mimosas had any champaign at all. My Caprese Omelet did not have any basil in it at all. The French toast my friend had was fantastic as was our waitress."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for an early dinner a couple of months back, just to show me the place.  It has a super cool atmosphere that he thought I'd like... and a cheese and pretzel fondue appetizer.

Well, it was pretty freaking fun, though 'm not sure how it'd be in the summer heat as most of the seating is outdoors (with misters).  The cheese pretzel fondue, I would skip next time but there was a kale salad there that may have been the best salad I've ever had.  I can't remember the name but it had nuts and corn and such in it.  It was delicious.  I keep meaning to go back for the salad!

Enjoy their outdoor games... corn hole, ping pong, etc.  

Might see ya there!"}
{"text":"Visited from Chicago and this was our first stop! Close to the airport and full of activity this Friday night. Stopped just for a drink and appetizer. The Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue was life changing. I did not expect the pretzels to be the size of baseballs (came with 12!) and the cheese to be served in a lit fondue dish. Romantic and reasonably priced, perfect Friday night date spot."}
{"text":"We know the FOX is clever, the restaurant concepts they come up with are like little magical yellow bricks down the yellow brick road that is lead by the Peter Piper and when one opens, people gather.
I love the concept of the Yard, group seating, plenty of games to play . . . and there were plenty of groups there.  
Now I know FOX is deft and any restaurant is all about maximizing the potential for the almighty drinks and serving of food.  
Unfortunately, at the Yard, service of food and drinks failed miserably.  There were a large group of us Elite Yelpers there with our friends celebrating some Dec. birthdays . . . yet, there weren't enough seating and I seriously stood there for almost 2 hours and not ONCE did a waiter come by and ask me if I wanted anything to eat or drink.  And I was more than ready to order something to eat and drink!!!
All those potential loss of revenue I saw all around me.  I'm thinking, \"if they would do the order and deliver system differently, the nightly intake would certainly double if not more!\"
I don't know what the solution is, but if I were FOX, I would send someone FOXY and brainy to spend some time to analyze the situation and come up with a procedure where the plentiful patrons are serviced because at the end of the day, you are still running a restaurant and not a free playground for the grownups."}
{"text":"I love this place as well. For some reasons my boyfriend and I have fell in love with places in central phx/arcadia area as far as dining out.  We love this place for a number of reasons one being most of the food, secondly because of the manager who always takes care of us in which we forgot his name, and also for the oyster shooters that next door made for us different than most other places.  I love the pretzel bites when the cheese isn't cold or the bread, the fried chicken is amazing and everything else we have tried was just decent. But we still have yet to try more on the menu so until then i'm still giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch, had chicken sandwich and it was fantastic, our waitress Victoria was excellent! Will be back although I think I need to consider what time."}
{"text":"This place is insaaaaane on weekends. Jesus. Either make a reservation or show up at a decent hour if you'd like to sit down at some point. 

Its a little more on the expensive side. Don't expect a cheap night here. 

I ordered the pretzels and fondue for the table and that was well worth it. Almost too much for a party of 6. Skip out on the artichoke hearts. 

Overall, this place is entirely packed to the brim with people on the weekends; it gets unbearable at times. But it's a good spot if you're looking for madness to jump start your night. 

Our service was fast, efficient, and friendly. One of our dishes got sent to another table at which point the manager comped a meal and gave us a free round of drinks. 

Parking is a B. I had to park at Armstrong McCalls. 

Come prepared, everyone. It's a party."}
{"text":"Went here on a work team dinner.  Nice, relaxing place.  Had a few appetizers and drinks out on the patio, then dinner later, and played some \"corn hole\" after that.  Will totally be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout was awesome!  We were reluctant to try since we had previous bad experience at the Scottsdale location with service.  Sadly, we had to wait an hour to get our bill last night at the Phoenix location, and had to ask for it 3 times.  If I go again it will be for lunch when I can park and get a bill."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place... A bit pricey for what you get. The grilled cheeses are good, but nothing to brag about. Fries are great...You can pick three different seasonings. The grilled cheese my husband got tasted like they just put chilli on it. Was very messy and did not taste very good (it was called the Young Cheezy). I do not recommend. The mac n cheese balls and poutine were good as well. I got the breakfast grilled cheese. It was ok. Like I said, nothing to brag about. The side of tomatoe soup tho was my favorite. 

I would rather go to Coach's on Banksville Road for a delicious grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday afternoon. They weren't really busy. The server was real nice and engaging. I had the Mac Attack, which was alright Mac and cheese was kinda bland. And the prices were on the higher end. But overall a real nice place will be back sometime."}
{"text":"Visited this for the first time with a friend. We shared the pretzel appetizer, which was amazing and unfortunately the best part of our meal. She got one of the salads and wasn't impressed. I got the tomato soup and half of a caprese sandwich. This place advertises its grilled cheese sandwiches, but they're not really grilled cheese sandwiches. It's almost like a sandwich in between two pieces of Texas Toast (which was hard & crunchy). The tomato soup was awful. 

I do like that they have Arsenal cider on tap. I'd go just for that!"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab brunch before heading to the Steelers game and The Yard was conveniently located between our hotel and the stadium. 

It opened at 10:00 am so we got there right then and were seated immediately. The brunch menu isn't extensive. There are about six dishes on it, but we could also order from the regular menu. The real star of the show? Bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's. The Bloody Mary's include vodka and then access to the Bloody Mary bar to craft your own. I ended up just ordering a single one and they prepared it for me. It hit the spot! My brother went for the mimosas and I'll assure you his glass was never empty. 

For brunch, I split the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken on top. It came with a side of bacon, tater tots, and I also ordered some fruit to feel a little less guilty about the situation. The portion was definitely prime for splitting, so unless you're looking to be on the couch for the rest of the day, I'd suggest going that route! Others at our table got the snozzberry pancakes which was also quite shareable. 

To top it off, there are plenty of TVs to catch a game and our waitress was very friendly and made our morning fun. All in all, it was just what we needed. I can definitely imagine hanging out here on another game day for some bottomless drinks and greasy food."}
{"text":"Eh. Really, just eh. 

Met a few friends for dinner there one Saturday night. We had reservations, so we were seated right away. As a vegetarian, I was excited about a place that served grilled cheese; however, for a grilled cheese, there really wasn't much cheese happening. I ordered the Shrooms sandwich. The bread was dry toasted, or at least it tasted dry toasted. If I'm eating a grilled cheese, please don't skimp on the butter when toasting the bread. I obviously am not watching my my fat intake for this meal. 

The fried macaroni balls were good, not spectacular, but good enough to be the best part of meal. (When is Melt going to come to Pittsburgh?? We've graced Cleveland with a Fatheads, it's only fair that they return the favor.) For a grilled cheese, it really wasn't melty, creamy, fatty and delicious like you would expect a $10.00 grilled cheese to be. Honestly, I've  made better grilled cheese at home that involved American cheese. 

Overall, I probably wouldn't go back because there are just so many more delicious options downtown that aren't trying to rupture my eardrums with their far too loud music."}
{"text":"Had reservations and definitely recommend on a weekend. Food was delicious, as always. Service was a little slow but they were packed. They offer an awesome Bloody Mary bar and bottomless mimosa bar for $15 pp. I had the \"Frank the Tank\" buffalo chicken grilled cheese with sweet potato waffle fries and the customary tomato soup. Awesome!!!! Never had a grilled cheese combo I didn't care for."}
{"text":"If there's something not to like about The Yard, I don't know what it is.

Oh, yeah. My bad. I do know what it is. It's the parking sitch.

Painful waits to park or exit when it's busy, and there's now a sign which alerts you that you will be towed if you park on a neighborhood street. 

Other than that parking deal, it's a great spot to chill. Hard to imagine a better looking patio with more comfortable options to place your rump and daydrink. The service doesn't hover but they're around when you need a refill or to re-up. Prices are not horrible and you can order great snacks from Culinary Dropout across the floor. The bathroom is begging you to walk in on someone of the opposite sex, but use it as a conversation starter if there's a lull in the action.

It has been said that the staff here range from dirty-hot to nerdy-hot. They do, which makes them hot either way. I will look at an attractive woman like a hungry lion unless someone smacks me and tells me to stop and the lady friend in my group did the same to the menfolk working here. What a perv, man.

The crowd was pretty mixed every time I've dropped in. A few older folks, some teenagers, hot moms with strollers and a couple douchebags thrown in. I prefer a bowl of m&ms to a bowl of just rice or beans though, don't you?"}
{"text":"Fun area to watch sports or play games. I love the outside seating but it's probably not that great in the summer."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with friends when visiting Pittsburgh. The 5 of us all had grilled cheeses which were amazing. Bottomless mimosas were a good deal and glasses never got below half full before the waitress came around and refilled them. Emma was a wonderful server! Recommend for all!"}
{"text":"While the food was delicious, one meal in our party took a significant amount of time longer than the others. Even though it was the same thing as one of the other members of the party ordered. They also sat us at a table that had the sun glaring at the one side of the table. We were allowed to move to another table but then they realized we needed to move again due to later reservations. I would definitely recommend the brunch but not the service."}
{"text":"Decided to meet up with some friends for happy hour before driving in rush hour to get home. We started out by trying to find a place to park which was impossible. Keep in mind folks theres NO PARKING here unless its valet, and even then it fills up. They must expect you to park in the neighborhood which is filled with no parking signs. Apparently the neighborhood got sick of being the parking lot. I've never been to an establishment that has no parking. Once you finally get in the valet the place is big and open inside.  There is a mix of everything for all age groups. Thats nice, but theres a lot of kids running around. The bathroom experience is different... Its fine for adults, but I wonder what the little girls think when they walk out of their toilet and are looking at a bunch of guys washing their hands. I really wouldn't want my kids to be in a washroom area of a bathroom with a bunch of drunk men...which there is no shortage of on a Friday night.  The entrance is off the back facing the parking lot/ alley way, and is next to an ugly yellow auto shop.  The inside is uniquely decorated and has some cool furniture on the patio to hang out in. Unfortunately it was all reserved, so we stood the whole time.  It took forever to get a drink and you had to almost yell to have a conversation. We tried an appetizer (brats) which was very good.. The only problem is it was quality and not quantity.  Very little food for the money although it did taste good."}
{"text":"Had brunch there and the Bloody Mary bar!!  EXCELLENT food and service.    Our waitress Audra was fantastic.   She was very helpful and friendly.    Five stars to the The Yard!!!"}
{"text":"I went to The Yard for Sunday brunch with my two girlfriends and loveddddd it. $15 for \"basically\" bottomless mimosas (they cut you off at 15) was the main reason we chose this place! Everything on the menu looked so good. I got the chicken and waffle sliders off of the brunch menu and it was incredible. One of my friends got the French toast and the other got the Mac attack grilled cheese and they both enjoyed their meals as well. The place is very clean, but boy was it crowded and loud! Oh well, it was totally worth it. I'll be back to try out some of those fancy grilled cheeses!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! One of our favorite spots to bring family and friends when visiting. I've only tried the food at culinary dropout which I highly recommend! The pretzel fondue is great as are their deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Pork belly nachos are superb - great drinks and food. Service is always killer good. Been coming to place for a couple years now and never gets old"}
{"text":"Super underrated brunch place. Came here because Pamelas had a 30 minute wait. We got grilled cheese, tomato soup and really good mac n cheese. I'd pass on  the crepe special (Peaches and Lavender) cause it's more of a dessert. Was super sweet and filled with house made whipped cream. Other than that I'd definitely come here for a casual meal. :-)"}
{"text":"It depends on what you are looking for-if the situation for you is that you and a group of friends are wanting to hang out on a friday night and don't care to go to the clubs or enjoy really good food,then the Yard is definitely a place to go - mediocre food, alcohol, and games. On the other hand, if you are looking for more of a place to experience great food, then I suggest you go somewhere else.

Parking is horrendous but you can valet- you will get ticketed if you park on the side of the street where it states no parking(trust me). You get in and the arrogant short bouncer checks your id and stamps you (like you're going in a club- go figure). Then the hostess doesn't even ask if you are dining so you walk in and realize you passed the hostess and you go back to ask her to get seated - but she has an attitude as if she is doing you a favor.

The service was slow - the salmon appetizer was tasty, the grilled cheese sliders were a little burnt, and the Italian salad was drenched in dressing. The chocolate peanut butter tart was not that great either. 

We then go to the playground to sign up for games. We get lost and find ourselves back to the hostess, which is more rude because I asked where I can get paddles for ping pong. 

So here's what you need to know - you can't sign up. You have to wait and watch people like a vulture to see if they are done playing and then when they look like they are done, you can either ask them or follow them up to the hostess to claim the spot because the hostess takes your id when you have their equipment. It's that simple! 

So once you have your paddles or your shuffleboard equipment or your corn hole toss stuff- you are good to go and you can have fun, hang out and be merry."}
{"text":"Dropped by here after work to meet some colleagues.  The place is situated on 7th St and it's extremely difficult to get there if you're going after work in the middle of rush hour.  The traffic is heavy and the middle \"turn\" lane becomes a traffic lane, which can confuse people and make it even worse.

Then after you get there and pull in, the only option that I could see for parking was valet.  You've got to be kidding me?  Nope, that's all I found....so I parked valet.  I spoke to one of my colleagues who lives nearby and she confirmed that the entire parking lot is valet only.  The cost is free, but you have to tip, so be sure you have tip money with you when you come here.  I rarely carry cash, so it was a big-time pain for me as I had to borrow money from colleagues to tip out....save the embarrassment and bring some case.

Once you get inside, it's kind of cool.  There's an indoor/outdoor vibe and the \"yard\" aspect of the place is nice.  There was plenty of room for everyone.  The Beer offering is outstanding....I don't remember what I ordered, I asked the server to surprise me with a nice dark Beer.  The Beer was tasty and she kept bringing it all night long without reminding her...great service.

I didn't try the food on this trip, it was a drinking only type of night.  If I was rating solely on drink/service, it gets a solid 4 Stars.  Gets knocked down to 3 Stars because of the parking fiasco here.

Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Meh.  Was excited to go here and it all started out great.  Our table was ready well ahead of schedule and I was hungry.  I ordered the \"Frank The Tank\" which was shredded chicken, shredded cheddar, provolone, red hot, and onions on grilled bread with the sides that come with it: tomato soup and home made potato chips.  The food arrived hot and looked great.  But, that's where it ends.  The sandwich was so salty that I couldn't finish it.  When I cut it open the sauce ran over the plate/breadboard it was served on and all over the table - so the signs were there.  Ok, my bad for ordering a red hot sauce sandwich - I'll accept that.  But worse was the tomato soup which tasted like the plastic bag that it probably came from and the chips were translucent and greasy.  The ones that weren't were stale and awful - I even had to spit one out.  I never do that kind of thing.  Anyway, I left feeling unsatisfied.  I have heard that their brunch is good.  Maybe I will give that a shot sometime. Maybe."}
{"text":"the place was great and we loved the food and outside seating. however service was horrible... took forever to get a refill and it was HOT out. we love culinary drop out so if we go back to probably won't be at the yard"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich, it was undercooked, very chewy and rubbery. When I let me server know it was undercooked it had already been a while since her last stop so I informed her and asked for the check. Clearly, the chicken sandwich had one bite out of it (because it was undercooked!) she brought the bill, didn't apologize for the undercooked chicken, didn't offer to take it off the bill, but instead asked if I wanted a box for the uncooked chicken!"}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends and have a drink and a meal. Food was good, ambiance great."}
{"text":"Third time coming here and seriously never coming back.  The wait staff is pretentious and rude and work at a snails pace.  The food is actually decent if they get your order right, which never happens.  They also have mandatory valet even when the place is dead.  Save your frustration and go to any of the other great places in the area.  This place blows!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here was on a Saturday night and it was PACKED! We (4 of us) waited for an hour for a table which wasn't too bad as we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited. It did take quite a long time to get a bartenders attention just to order this drink but eh... To be expected. Once we were seated it didn't take long to get drinks and put in our order.  We had the pretzel bites with provolone fondue and they were decadent and marvelous. Mmm. I ordered the kale sweet potato salad w goat cheese. It had a sprinkle of pomegranate tendrils and a delicious dressing. I devoured it. My friends ordered the fried chicken, butternut squash tortellini, and a burger.  Everyone enjoyed their meals without complaint. My only negative would be that the table we were seated at was a bench on one side and chairs on the other, another table was close to ours which wasn't too bad until a man decided to join that table (sitting on the bench between us) and kept using our table as his arm rest! As we were eating dinner! How rude! But that's not The Yards fault. That's some rude hipster dude that had no respect for the people around him."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Such a fun place to hang out with a group. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I can't give enough praises for The Yard! From the moment we walked in to hosts who greeted us with smiles to the moment we left, we were treated with grace and a beautifully trained staff. Our waiter was so pleasant and really knew the menu which we appreciated. The food! The grilled cheese sandwiches are heaven!!!! We ordered the 'Poppin my collar', the Crab Sandwich and one more and they were all DELICOUS!!!  My potato chips were slightly burned, but that was ok. We will definitely return to sample more of your appetizing menu!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am a huge Fox restaurant fan, they seem to do most things right. Culinary Drop Out is one of my favorites of the Fox restaurants, so when I heard they had a new location with a super cool patio/ \"Yard\" I was stoked to go try it out. The menu is pretty much the same as culinary drop out in Scottsdale, which is fine by me, because it is so good! The inside of the restaurant is not as cool as I expected, but the yard was pretty fun. I liked the games everywhere and the extremely laid-back vibe. The best part of it all, the pretzel fondue. Do not leave this place without trying it. You won't be dissapointed. :) I came for lunch, but am looking forward to coming for drinks and games sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to come and hang out with friends. You can also play some games after you eat. Parking is a bit of a hassle, but you'll really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese (Lafferty, Daniel) that I ordered tasted very nice. However, the burger my fiancée ordered was unevenly cooked with definite medium rare spots when she ordered medium well. They were nice enough to correct the issue, though. The draft list was pretty nice. It is a bit expensive for what you get, but many places in the city are now. Also, the acoustics are terrible. We could barely carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic and I can't wait to go back and try more of \"The Official Grilled Cheese of the Pittsburgh Penguins.\" I had a delicious pulled chicken variation along with the chips. Sandwich was amazing, chips left a little to be desired as they were too well cooked for my liking. Next time I'll get the fries (which I helped myself to from my son's plate). Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Love the concept. Plenty of things to do. Good people watching; however, the kids are overwhelming and unsupervised. I felt like I was at a family BBQ- and not in a good way. If I were to return, it'd be much later in the evening when you could be comfortable knowing you're surrounded by adults..."}
{"text":"I took my family of 4 here for dinner on a Saturday night after hearing good things. We couldn't have been more disappointed. We tried to make a reservation ahead of time but they don't take reservations on the weekend. The wait for a table was 1 hour, which I can understand because it was 6:30pm on a Saturday, an obviously busy time. We got our table exactly 1 hour later. Our server wasn't bad but she was clearly in a rush and stressed out. We felt rushed the entire meal. The food came out pretty fast but was an absolute mess. Everything was insanely greasy and undercooked. The fries were basically raw potatos. The tomato soup was thick like oatmeal and not even edible. The only special request we gave was no mustard on one of the sandwiches. It came out covered in mustard. I just ate it because at this point we were just trying to get out of there. The bill came out.....$65 for 4 glorified grilled cheese sandwiches and drinks for 2 adults and 2 kids. Overpriced to say the least.

Two of us started feeling sick to our stomachs immediately after the meal. I can still feel the meal laying in my stomach as I'm writing this, 16 hours later. Needless to say....we will not be back."}
{"text":"Went for a weeknight to try out the new location. It's inside the Galleria mall, where there's a good section of parking above and tons of parking in the garage below. This is located at the tippy top of the mall so you either have to walk up a set of stairs or if you have a wheelchair/etc, there's an elevator that I think you have to take from the bottom floor? To be honest it's a little tough to find your way up to the restaurant if you aren't able to walk up the stairs. 

My friend and I got some cocktails and poutine tots to share.

The tots were fried perfectly & the gravy and melted cheese were delicious! The beer cheese on the side, however tasted chalky and yucky.

The inside is open and airy and very industrial. There are standard tables and also the high tops near the bar (which I hate- where am I going to put my purse??)

I will definitely be back to watch a hockey game and eat, or have a nice lunch before catching a movie at the theatre right outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"So went to the Yard a bit ago for dinner and I guess it's ok. The big draw here is their gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches. I tried the smack yo mama which has pulled pork with some spicy sauces inside. It was pretty good, but nothing out of this world. I guess it's hard to get excited over grilled cheese, even if it's gourmet.

The place was packed and the service was fine. We also had the poutine as an appetizer and it was ok as well. I don't mean to knock the place, just nothing really stood out as exciting to me. I stopped back a second time, but it was just to have a cold one. The bartender was nice and quick, but we were the only ones at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here with co-workers for lunch and I ordered the Wang Chung Tonight grilled cheese which had gouda, BBQ pulled chicken and asian slaw on thick cut toast served with a side of tomato soup and the garlic-parm chips.  

The pulled chicken was good on the sandwich but I was disappointed in the gouda cheese.  Rather than having a slice or slices of gouda they had put shredded gouda on the sandwich and not much of it.  I could taste a hint of it every once in a while which wasn't so bad since the chicken and the slaw were tasty but for a grilled cheese place, I would've thought there'd be a bit more cheese to the sandwich.

The slaw on the sandwich wasn't the creamy type which I was happy about.  I'm not a fan of mayo based slaw.  It was very well flavored and seasoned and complemented the chicken very well.  

The chips were fresh and crispy and a perfect portion.  I was not a fan of the tomato soup...it was more like a thick sauce than a soup and I had about 2 spoons of it but didn't finish it."}
{"text":"Perfect place for groups with people with different tastes for food. Adults games available, although some people take their kids too. I would consider this an adult atmosphere. Closes early on weekends."}
{"text":"Ate here this afternoon with 2 coworkers for a very quick lunch, and I have to say, I was pleased. I've heard mixed reviews about The Yard in Market Square, but still, any place that specializes in grilled cheese... I'm there.  Our service was quick and accurate, both very important things when you're hungry but in a rush. Our server was totally on board with the fact that we had to fly out of there, and he had our food out in less than 10 minutes, and our checks on the table shortly after so we wouldn't have to wait for anything. 

Truthfully, I can't remember what my sandwich was called, but it was REALLY good. Perfect portion, everything tasted great and was exactly what I expected based on the menu description. 

I can't wait to go back when I have more time!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at this location and it was such an awesome experience! Our servers name was Brandon and he was very friendly and explained things thoroughly. He suggested their \"fireball\" shot and it was actually pretty good! The place was extremely busy on a Saturday night but our food came out fast and we were never without a drink. The yard area was busy also but we made connections with others to get the gaming material when they were done. You just have to be friendly :) Anyways, you should definitely give this hopping spot a shot! And try out there delicious meatloaf and grilled chicken club sandwich!"}
{"text":"Went to the Yard to meet up with some friends for drinks and decided to get something to eat as well. We sat at a table top near the bar around 9 and a few guys at the bar were all over our table. We had to move to another table but that didn't stop them from spreading out to our new table. Kind of hard to enjoy a meal with drunk old guys bumping into you! 

Anyways... I got the frank the tank grilled cheese and it was disappointing. Not really a grilled cheese more like a sandwich with cheese. When I think grilled cheese I think eeewwy gooey cheese. I don't even feel like my cheese was all the way melted. 

They do have a large variety of craft beers though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Florida and just loved this place. The wings were great and the poutine fries are a must. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, but we went on a busy weekend night, and the front desk staff reflected their frustration with clients and high numbers that evening. We had a reservation, and it was not ready for us at the time of arrival (which was fine). When we received our text to let us know our table was ready, we approached the host stand to claim our table to find out it had not been cleaned off yet. Fine. Then, we waited 20 more minutes before approaching the stand again. We were told \" well, you can go and hang out over the table and stare at them to make them move faster\". Rude, if you ask me. Anyway, the rest of our visit was great. We had the pretzels and beer cheese, a turkey pastrami, and 7other dishes that I don't remember because I was a bit intoxicated (We Uber'd home). Anyways, great drinks, great food, ok service."}
{"text":"Five stars for Danielle and team's outstanding service at Culinary Dropout.  When you expect 14 and 20ish show up for a birthday party and you can still keep up with service with speed, grace, and a smile you are pretty outstanding!  The food and atmosphere were spot on as well. And when you're ordering appetizers if there's a better value than there antipasto plate in the valley I'd be shocked. My new favorite place for a night out with friends.

My only comment is re the valet.  The restaurant/bar is open until 1 but we were told we had better to plan to retrieve our car by 11 or it could be towed?  Seemed like an odd set up and the valet staff didn't seem overly concerned about the disconnect when I asked about it.  We would have stayed longer but didn't want to push it."}
{"text":"The Yard is a great place to take a small group of colleagues for a nice happy hour or a group of friends for a catch up session with some great food and a great atmosphere. Anytime I have someone come to visit me here in PHX, I always take them to The Yard. There's plenty of options to eat or drink and the ambience is awesome. If you like to play corn hole or shuffle board, they have that for you. I would say that the central Phoenix location is a better vibe (young professionals) than the Tempe location (college crowd). Regardless, it's a great place and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere however not having a baby changing station in the bathroom will make me not want to come back. It's inexcusable in this day and age not to have somewhere private to change my baby."}
{"text":"I came here with a huge group as part of Geek Girl Brunch Pittsburgh and the service shad was fantastic! The staff was super friendly and accommodating, the food was delicious, and it was a holiday weekend, so it was pretty busy as is. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you ever wished you had a really cool yard, filled with fun games like ping pong and cornhole, decorated with fashionable, comfy furniture, populated with trendy cenpho families and couples, and attended by a helpful, hip waitstaff, serving delicious food and creative cocktails, then The Yard is the place for you.
 Service was friendly and prompt, and they happily accommodated our seating requests for heaters/sun/light/etc.
 The brunch menu (Culinary Dropout) was enjoyable, but not fantastic. I loved the Capn Crunch French toast, but the burger was just meh, and the breakfast burrito was kind of lacking.
 The bar menu looked awesome, but since I'm with child, I had to be satisfied with just dreaming about their creative concoctions. I figured a bartender that dreamed up a book full of interesting cocktails and shots must be able to whip up a pretty good mocktail, right? Wrong, I guess. My request to the waitress for the bartender's choice of \"something interesting without alcohol\" was met with a blank stare and an offer of fruit juice. I clarified - \"do they make any virgin cocktails or mocktails?\" She said she would ask, but came back with a half orange juice-half pineapple juice. Not exactly the most daring of creations. Oh well.
 The main attraction here is definitely the outdoor seating area (or yard, if you will). The business was originally a motorcycle sales/repair place, and the motorcycles were all showcased under a huge canopy. That canopy forms the cover for the yard and provided almost 100% shade on a Sunday morning. Under the canopy are a turf area for cornhole, about 4-5 ping pong tables, a foosball table, shufflepuck, and lots of seating. The area is really huge, and even though there were lots of customers in that morning, it was never packed. In addition, there's plenty of space for bike/stroller parking, which was really cute, and seemed to encourage many of the locals to venture out for brunch.
 The  brunch crowd contained a lot of families and there were plenty of kids running around the cornhole turf. I imagine the scene is a little different at night, but I can't comment on that.
 I'm excited for the new seafood restaurant that's opening in one of the other spots surrounding the yard - I read somewhere that it will be an oyster bar, so that would bring a different vibe. Somebody else said a 3rd position will be occupied by a coffee-shop type place, but I can't confirm that.
 Overall, another good eatery with awesome drinks and a super-cool vibe to add to your uptown rotation."}
{"text":"My first experience at The Yard was so great! It was during my annual trip to Phoenix for spring training and my friends showed me a lot of new places that have been popping up in the area over the past few years and The Yard was hands down the best! I had been to Culinary Dropout before and loved the food! I had no idea that The Yard was just a more fun version of Culinary!

The drinks were great (try the Pistols at Dawn, different but great), the food was excellent (get the pretzel fondue, trust me) and the atmosphere. Oh man, the atmosphere is one of the best I've seen in a bar/restaurant! The rustic feel and the semi open outdoor setting combine to make for a truly unique dining experience! 

The service was solid and the crowed varied from hipsters to young families. This will be a staple for all future trips. Give it a shot! I think you'll dig it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I don't get why the reviews are so low. They have live music, multiple restaurants, cocktails, and space for 4 corn hole games, a foozball table, shuffleboard, 4 ping pong tables and a ping pong area + free photo \"booth\" thing where you can e-mail yourself photos. The live band I saw today was Vinyl Station & they played some awesome cover songs (Beatles, the Black Keys, Cold Play, Oasis, etc.). We tried food & cocktails @ Culinary Dropout and thought the food and service were great! No complaints. Valet parking is complimentary & there is plenty of space for large groups of friends. This is a perfect spot to have some good quality fun!"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!  The prime rib sandwich is to die for!!! For an app you can't go wrong with the pretzels. I would highly recommend this place for a great meal."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place simply for the bustling atmosphere. The vibe is usually a positive one and I admit I always have a pretty decent time here. However, I went recently after the second portion of the restaurant opened and it was a clusterfuck. I don't think anyone who works there anticipated the size of the crowd with 2 restaurants operating. Everything was extremely slow, people seemed cranky, the food was not very staggered and took ages to arrive and the wait was 2 HOURS to even be seated. It was painfully obvious they weren't prepared for that amount of people.

After spending something like 3 hours waiting and finally eating, we ventured over to the game area. This was pointless. Way too many people were playing and being extremely selfish. Rather than playing a few games of cornhole and relinquishing the bags to someone who was waiting, people would play like 14 games. Dude, seriously. Don't be a dick. There needs to be a rule that says that: \"Play and have fun! But don't be a selfish dick.\" Eventually, around 30 minutes before closing, we got to play ping pong. Hurray? And that brings me to another point - why are you closing at midnight? I understand having the kitchen close at that time, that's not unusual. But the entire bar? It's bizarre. 

Luckily the crowd I was with is a blast and kept each other occupied while we stood waiting our turn to play one of the games. We ventured over to Pomeroy's afterwards. That place is probably thanking its lucky stars The Yard opened.

Bottom line is: If you go here on the weekend ANY time of the day, it's a long wait and so crowded it's almost not enjoyable. It was better before the second spot opened. I dunno if I'll go back, there's a lot of options in this area where I don't need to spend 5 hours waiting and eating. Little Woody's is a much better option for games and Vovomeena kills it for breakfast. And I can actually park."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite brunch spot in the city. The bottomless mimosas aren't too strong, but we're past the point of trying to get trashed at brunch. Try the chicken and waffle sliders, or the pancake sandwich for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fun atmosphere.  Management was attentive and catered to our family with a 2 year old and an infant.  Really friendly and will definitely be back.  Try the chips and dip, MAC burger, and Fried Chicken!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times. The grilled cheeses are big, messy, and delicious. Their burger is above average. Their chili is really, really good when it's available, as is their tomato soup which is, I believe, always available. Service has always been friendly and prompt. I would suggest a reservation if you suspect a busy evening though. The first time my wife and I tried to go it was quite crowded and a table wasn't available for at least three hours. But we've also been there when it was pretty quiet and our reservation wasn't necessary, so it's really dependent upon the situation, season, and events going on in the city that night I think.

Overall, however, I will continue to go there with regularity; one of my favorite joints in the city and for the style and price range I don't think you'll find much better."}
{"text":"Huge fan.   Great (creative) food, great atmosphere, great scenery.  Throw some bags, or deliver punishment on the foosball table if you like. Also, I love a good microbrew / high gravity beer and The Yard has plenty of those to offer, but I also like a good cheap beer.    The Mystery Beer option is fun -- $2 gets you a random 12 oz can of beer in a brown paper bag.   You don't know what you're getting until it gets to your table.  

The server typically hangs around to see what you got, although that may be just for show.  Who cares when you can be 5 beers in and walk out of a trendy place like this with a $10 bar tab?  Further, the \"Double Blind\" gets you a mystery beer plus a mystery airplane bottle of booze for $6.  Hammer Down!  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food was good. More importantly, we have a great server. Drew made sure we were taken care of at every point. Furthermore, everyone here worked like a team to make sure guests were taken great care of. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I hate this restaurant. Every time I come, I sit at the bar and order something on the menu that is inevitably out. The first time it was Chardonnay (they did not have any Chardonnay?!) the second time it was a draft beer that was on their list. I used to be a bartender so I completely understand the menu differing from reality but what really infuriates me is the bartenders. When they're menu is wrong and we take additional time to figure out our order they immediately move on and we don't see them again for ten minutes. Either make your menu accurate or make your bartenders responsive. As it is, everytime I come here I'm dissatisfied. I'd rather go to any bar but this one."}
{"text":"Was here during a work trip and tried a few other places that all had long lines! I'm telling you that this place is legit! We sat at the bar and Jason (our bartender) was very attentive and answered any questions we had regarding the menu or any of the beers on tap, and there are plenty! The only negative I would say is the portion sizes. I had the poutine which was fantastic, but was somewhat saddened by the relatively small bowl and portion that it came with. My coworker got the Jerk grilled cheese and was happy with it, but to me, it looked like it was lacking some additional meat. All in all, this place is good, with fantastic service and good atmosphere that wasn't too loud to have a one on one conversation with a coworker!"}
{"text":"What a great spot. Only complaint is it is far for me in North Phoenix. Uber it is. Great food options and great drink options. Love the concept and enjoyed doing something different on a  Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Went there for my son-in-laws birthday.  They have an appetizer menu.  We ordered the chili cornbread which we cut the two pieces into 4.  My daughter wanted the goat cheese appetizer.  Way expensive for the two small pieces she received, although she liked the flavor.  I felt the regular menu prices were fine.  They had one vegetarian dish which my daughter did enjoy.  My husband had the fish (rock fish) and chips, I the cheese burger and my son-in-law the roast beef au-jour sandwich.  He raved about that.  They had an indoor and out door eating area although the outdoor area was well shaded with a wooden slatted roof.

The place was very busy for a 12 o'clock Sunday crowd.  Our waitress was fine and bubbly, but one of the waitresses wore a dress that just covered her rear barely and the side of that dress, which hug her snugly, had a half moon cut out on both sides of her leg which raised what you saw even more.  I don't mean to be an old foggy, but a family restaurant needs more appropriate dress.  The place was very noisy probably due to bad acoustics. They had busboys who took their job seriously and always wanted to remove plates that weren't ready to be removed.

I would say the worse thing about this restaurant was they had valet parking.  It appears that a lot of restaurants downtown are doing this.  This is very annoying as I do not want to pay for someone to park my car.........another added expense.

Pros:  Food was fine and not overly priced
Cons: Lousy valet parking

{"text":"We almost didn't find this place as their address is 5th Avenue,   but they are really in Market Square.  Head upstairs to a very noisy environment.  We both started off with a beer.   Mine was Firehouse Red and my husband had some IPA.  We both made good choices.   Server was quick and helpful.

I LOVE buffalo chicken, so the Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer was a no brainer for me.   My husband ordered the Full Monte Cristo.   Food came quickly and was served with their tomato soup and chips.   Everything was hot and seemed freshly made.    The soup is nothing special,  or even really like tomato soup.   I used it as a dip for my chips.   I was super disappointed in my sandwich.  I love mac and cheese, but that's all you all you could taste.   The buffalo chicken had no zip to it and just tasted like cooked chicken.   Really a big bummer as this combo was a dream come true for me.   My husband really liked his sandwich.   His was huge and although different, as it wasn't fried in egg batter, he loved the flavors.

Prices were typical of a restaurant of this type.   Variety of beer is nice, daily specials look priced well."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and another couple after seeing our first Disney on Ice show as a married couple.  We made reservations for 1:30pm and when we finally were parked and walked over to Market Square, we were quickly seated by our hostess.  For being a late afternoon lunch on Saturday, the restaurant was fairly packed.  I noticed they had a mimosa/bloody Mary bar, but I unfortunately did not partake in it.  

We ordered the pub pretzels for an appetizer.  They came as 4 decently sized pieces of bread with a honey mustard and cheese dipping sauce. My wife is a huge pub pretzel fan and these hit the spot for her.  They came out warm and nicely salted and had a nice fresh fluffy taste to them.  For our meal, I ordered the \"Mother of Dragon\" which had chicken, cheese, and some jalapeno peppers.  It had a good level of heat and the meal was extremely filling between the sandwich, small side of tomato soup, and homemade chips with garlic parmesan seasoning.  Besides the garlic seasoning on the chips being a little weak (not necessarily a bad thing for my breath), it was a well put together meal.  My wife ordered the \"Smack Yo Mama\" meal with wedding soup and chips.  The sandwich was just as amazing as its name and came with shredded chicken with BBQ sauce and cheese.  

The meal was very filling and very tasty.  They have an ideal location being in the heart of Market Square.  The place has a very trendy hip atmosphere, and I can see why this place has been fairly popular.  I Would definitely recommend giving this place a try.  The prices are fairly reasonable as well for downtown dining."}
{"text":"Apparently afraid the food may be subpar the server for our meal insisted on holding a credit card when we ordered. This 62 year old has dined at much nicer - and costlier-  restaurants that take your payment at the end of your meal.  With rampant credit card theft the policy leaves one's card available to be skimmed  or otherwise misused

This diner will frequent other places in the future. Cannelloni was average and soup came without any bread."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Basically just your standard burger joint, for the most part. The oysters are the best I've had in all of Arizona though. 

I really love coming to The Yard for date nights. It's casual enough to grab a drink but still a classy atmosphere. Plus, the games (corn toss, table tennis, etc) make it more fun for the guys."}
{"text":"Ever miss playing with your friends at recess? Well, you can again at The Yard!

I was quite impressed with this venue on Saturday night, I must say. First of all, LOVE that Yard is \"ridin shotgun\" with one of my faves, Culinary Dropout. This place is pretty genius in my eyes, bc they have so many activities going on such as Ping-Pong and bean bag toss but still has the \"lounge\" vibe w/their couches off to the side. Yes, there were pretty ppl here but I never sensed any lame snobby-ness. 

HINT: Parking is sort of a bitch. Park across the street by Basha's, but beware that the entrance is in the back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Loved the atmosphere.  They get busy early and parking is limited so make a reservation and use the free valet parking."}
{"text":"This is a fun and unique place.  Amazing atmosphere, really unbeatable. There's nowhere more fun to hang out than on those soft green couches while you're waiting for your turn at corn hole.  Somehow the crowd usually seems to be over-dressed thirty-somethings, however, usually who have reserved a lot of those pleasant spots on weekend nights, so the crowded-ness can put a damper on it sometimes.  Nothing that can't usually be solved by some excellent live cover bands and a bowl of hot soft pretzels."}
{"text":"Very tasty & great service!  I would highly recommended to everyone!  The games were fun too!"}
{"text":"My diagnosis of The Yard is that it suffers from Bipolar Disorder, a rare contagious variety that makes me both love and loathe it in return.  Even in writing this review I don't know where to start or what to say.  

From the moment you walk in to The Yard there are choices-- Culinary Dropout? Little Cleo's? Inside seating or outside seating? Your mind reels with the possibilities, and you are left wondering \"WHO is this place?\"

I've been to Culinary Dropout a handful of times and each experience, much like the mood disorder, is different-- great service one time, horrible the next.  The menu itself can't even decide what it wants to be.  On it, you have your choice of fancy meats and cheeses (antipasti) or you can order chicken curry.  You also have a selection of sandwiches and salads, but if you're looking for something heartier, there's always the meatloaf.  They've also included a butternut squash cannelloni for good measure.  With such an odd variety it becomes difficult to choose something.

If you're indecisive or have indecisive friends and family, this is a great place.  The food isn't bad but it's not the best either (and the portions are pretty skimpy).  As far as the environment, again, not sure what the place is supposed to be so it's a little of everything.  They have a stage at the front of the restaurant, far away from most of the seating, and I feel bad for the singers and musicians I've seen there because it's as if they're playing for no one.  It's an unfortunate layout.  

My recommendation is to come here for happy hour or for a little nosh while you watch the game.  And be sure to take your Lithium before entry!"}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. The beer selections is great as well as the location for their tvs during sporting events. At first looking at the menu, I thought everything would be so heavy and not appetizing. After trying different items on the menu and talking to the bartenders about their knowledge on craft beer, I started to love it. I go there often to meet my boyfriend after work. The service is quick and selections on tap are always a good variety!"}
{"text":"I went to The Yard twice for a happy hour and enjoyed almost everything! The first time we ordered pretzels and mac n' cheese balls. Both were tasty but I do question whether or not the pretzels were fresh made or frozen.The second time I went, I  ordered the \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" and it basically had everything I was looking for in a man on it. There was steak, roasted red peppers, beer cheese and caramelized onions. I could have died from how tasty the combination was! 

I have had some really good things at The Yard and some not-so-impressive things. The staff is also a little slow. I don't mind going there for a happy hour but it most likely would not be a place I would suggest."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the place to be on a cool fall Phoenix night. They have tons of games to entertain anyone of all ages and you must get the soft pretzels and provolone fondue!!!! Out. Of. This. World."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sunday funday spots. While walking in turn in your ID for some bags or paddles. Then head to the patio. We stop by the bar, place an order and grab a drink. Try the Room Service- YUM! My husband and I moved to Cali and are bummed we don't have anything like The Yard anymore. 

Friendly staff, yard games and a great place to gather with friends!!

Tip: the parking lot is Valet only so be prepared to tip the guys. Other than that street parking is first come, first serve. So be ready to walk a bit."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about this place from a few people. I was excited to check it out. Atmosphere was awesome with a lot to keep you occupied. Service at the bar was ok, but encountered many rude employees (mainly the servers). Drinks were way overpriced. It has a big \"hipster\" vibe. Not my scene. Maybe if the service was better I would have given more stars. Its all about service to me, if I'm gonna be paying 9 bucks for a drink I had better be treated better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the fondue pretzels are to die for! Slightly overpriced and difficult for reservations with larger parties."}
{"text":"I love The Yard, however, the Market Square location isn't my favorite. My friends and I have gone after work a couple of times and the hosts/hostesses have always made it so uncomfortable for us as far as seating us around happy hour. The tables are somehow always reserved except for maybe a few so we also feel like a burden coming in. Other than that awkward encounter, the waiting staff is typically very friendly. If you aren't at the bar, sometimes you might have to wait a little for a drink, but it's not a huge deal. Their pretzels are DELICIOUS and filling for an app! The happy hour has decent prices and they have a fun selection of beers!"}
{"text":"Tried it, overrun by kids. Like bean bags knocking over drinks. If you look, it is listed as a bar, meaning adults and drinking. But there were at least a hundred wild children running around dominating the games while moms and dads got sloshed at their tables. If you do go, make it later at night to avoid the playground environment. And do not sit by the corn hole or ping pong or you will be picking balls and bags out of your drinks. Ewww, that sounded gross!!! I may or may not give this another try after 9 pm when the children are nestled all snug in their beds..."}
{"text":"Awesome and activity filled place that's great for music eats entertainment socializing and indoor/outdoor evenings.  Assorted \"yard\" games like cornhole, ping pong, etc.  open concept, 2 restaurants (I think). Outdoor living room areas to hang with your friends eat/drink. 
We had burgers. They were great. Fries okay.  

Complimentary valet
Fun vibe"}
{"text":"Fun place to play some outdoor games, and drink. 
Great atmospher, nice decor.

The only downside, yard needs more game tables, maybe darts and a few other choices, as when its busy its hard to get a place to play."}
{"text":"Went to the new restaurant at the South Hills Gallaria. It was there second day opened. Was impressed with the menu and speed of service.  Ordered regular grilled cheese with tomato soup.  Only thing that could use improvement would've been cheese and croutons for the soup"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because they sadly got rid of the bloody mary bar at the galleria one. Other than that the beer selection is amazing and the happy hour is almost as good as the loose moose (if you know of the place). Their prices are very reasonable. I however did not care for the signature grilled cheeses as the Texas toast had so much butter on it, I almost felt like I was eating the stick of butter. Couple that with a nice juicy 34 oz beer, heartburn soon kicked in. Their brunch menu looks very good and will have to go back to try it."}
{"text":"Part of Culinary dropout, 

The bar is right there....games to play. People arent rude and hog things they aren't playing (which is nice).


Come by with friends and leave your kids at home...seriously don't bring your kids..."}
{"text":"The Yard was a bit of an overwhelming experience for me.  We had reserved 'outdoor' seats at Little Cleo's, not realizing that outdoor actually means in the yard.  Being in the yard on a Saturday night is certainly one of those things you should be prepared for.  For the amount of money spent on our meal, it was disappointing that conversation was difficult over the roar of the crowd.  Very reminiscent of my college days, and spending time in a bar on Mill.  I could barely hear the server!   While waiting for our table (20 min wait with reservations) we sauntered over to the bar that services the yard and Culinary Dropout.  My husband's beer cost as much as my mojito.  It wasn't that the mojito was cheap, but the fact they charged a crazy amount for a beer.  It was almost 8 bucks.  The worst part, as others have said, is the parking.  Valet was full, so we had to park across the street in a shopping center and run across five lanes of traffic.   I will say that once I accepted that I wasn't going to be having a fine dining experience (though I certainly paid for it) I was able to just sit back and enjoy the people watching.  This place was fun for people watching.  There were bikers, ping-pongers, and that funny drunk guy who was laughing way too loud at his own jokes.  So, essentially the Yard provided dinner and a show.  The cover band playing at Culinary was a fun touch too.  All in all, I had fun.  That being said, I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"I like this place.  This is my second visit, my first was for a yoga class and brew in The Yard.  Interesting brews.  Enticing menu.  Different vibe than at The C Dropout Tempe or Fashion  Square locations.  Outdoor gaming area.  Large bar.  A Mexican restaurant and seafood place also make up The Yard.  At CD, try the pretzel app with cheese.  The soup of the day is interesting and tasty.  Currently, the perogie  app is a seasonal must try.  Varied and ample seating in and out.  Also, check out the live music.  The scene is Phoenix, east of Central.  Scottsdale, it is not.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place would be awesome. If there were no people...

In theory, the concept is flawless. Access to great food, fun games, and hours of entertainment! Sadly, because some people are just plain stupid, rude, or of a whats-mine-is-mine-and-whats-yours-is-mine nature, the place becomes an obnoxious free for all where respect is an unfamiliar term. 

We brought our kids and all waited patiently to play games. When our time finally came to play, we had about 3 minutes of uninterrupted play before under-supervised children started stealing our bean bags, walking in the middle of games, and wandering around aimlessly while we gently suggested their parents remove them before they got hurt. After having our bags taken for the 10th time (no, I'm not joking), we moved on to foosball. 

After trading in our bags for balls, we headed over to play some foos. Oops, apparently some people like to scam the system and bring their own balls so they don't have to wait for their turn. Clever! But very annoying. Not to mention terribly disappointing. Didn't we all learn how this works in kindergarten? Come on, people. Do better. 

We tried. We really did. We so wanted to love the place. I mean, the concept is really awesome! It's just a shame that people have to go and ruin the fun. 

If you're an insanely patient person with forgiveness dropping from your pores, this place is for you. If you're normal and follow the rules and expect others to do the same, I'm afraid this place might fall short for you.

EDIT: Within an hour of posting this review, I heard from the manager. I have to applaud that kind of attention to the brand. That's very, very impressive. I so appreciate your efforts. I know you can't be expected to control everyone who comes to your establishment, but perhaps a little monitoring of the game areas would help improve the overall experience? 
Thank you again for taking the time to read my review and respond."}
{"text":"Great concept, we could use something like this in Houston.  Two restaurants with a shared common outdoor recreational space...an adult playground!"}
{"text":"The physical restaurant is pretty hip with more of a bar vibe.  We were there for lunch so it basically came off as loud.  I heard so much about the food and it was good but not great.  The menu is definitely creative with varieties of grilled cheese but little variation.  Our bill for 6 for lunch was $100 with tip (no booze) so not cheap.  All in all worth trying once but seemed more of a novelty than Pittsburgh staple restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been there  a couple times. It's a great place ruined by over priced drinks and food. That and there is limited parking. Their happy hour is a joke, limited to a small section of the restaurant. Service was ok. Overall value is poor."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends here for drinks and ended up staying way longer than we planned. It's a hipster vibe in here and I love the games and fun stuff to do in there. 
Didn't really eat too much of the food but I did order the pretzels and beer cheese. Very yummy! Great service, and love the atmosphere. This place is really neat."}
{"text":"Good salmon dinner. Cold atmosphere so dress warm. Very nice staff. But very vanilla clientele. Not very cultural but what else to expect from Phoenix."}
{"text":"Obsessssed with this place now!!  Can't believe I'd never made it out here until yesterday when I went with a friend!  When we arrived there was a line of cars waiting to valet and the parking lot was full so I was worried it was going to be overcrowded inside and crazy busy.  Much to my surprise, although there were a lot of people inside, the layout is so open and gigantic that it didn't feel like it!  The servers were all SUPER friendly and not in a fake way, they're just really good at their jobs.

Food and drinks did take a little while to arrive but that was to be expected when a place has as many people as The Yard did.The atmosphere of the place is awesome too, just really a chill, fun place to come with friends and hang out.  Can't wait for the next time we go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place (Culinary Dropout). Love the food here. I've liked everything that I have tried from here so far. Service is pretty good but it does get pretty crowded during lunch times and ofcourse at night. 
There are some games you can play out in the yard-like area. Pretty fun!
My complain is about forced vallet parking. I wish they had a self-park area. If u want to self-park you will have to park out on the street. 
Overall I've had good experiences and recommend it!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to here!  It's so far away from me so I don't frequent it often, or I would.  It's a a grown up playgound!  The yard has massive space for bags (some of you call it corn hole), shuffle board, ping pong, you name it. There are adirondack chairs and tables surrounding the place if you just want to watch. The high ceilings and misters all around cool the place off during the hot summer months, so I can see this as being okay to go to during the hellish hot months.
The few times I have been, they have always have live music, which is an added bonus.
The wait to get a table is a monster, so be forewarned"}
{"text":"One of the most fun places to hang out and socialize. They have 5 bags board and numerous ping pong tables. Plenty of things to do to keep you busy.

All outside with little fire pits to keep you warm, they also have plenty of picnic tables.

The $2 brown bag special is fun, but they have sooo many craft beers as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Food is so good! The atmosphere is relaxing and fun! Definitely a place to hang out and have fun and meet new people!."}
{"text":"if you know and like the famous MELT in Cleveland than you will love this place! Now that I've found it will be my pre-game rally meal for Pens and Steelers. So many choices of grilled cheese it's off the wheels! 

Whatever you order consider adding the Mac&cheese INTO your sammy you will thank me for it! 

Great Beer list too!"}
{"text":"Coming here makes me feel like my friends and I are all back in college. As if we're at some friend of a friend of a friend's surprisingly well-kept house, playing bags next to people you don't know, but looks like you should. The only difference is that the drinks are better, the food is better, and I'm not tripping on crushed red Solo cups when I run after a wayward ping pong ball. 

Even on a Friday night, this place is popping. Luckily, one of our group got in early and snagged us some picnic tables in the back since a select few group reservations are accepted (so don't delay in putting in your reso, kids!). Our waitress expertly handled our numerous tabs and was not the worst when it came to checking in on us, especially considering the reviews I'd read about non-existent service. It was beautiful outside, but I was still grateful for the giant evap cooler in the corner after a particularly heated game of bags. Which, btw, my team lost despite a couple of magical throws by yours truly. 

Now let's get to the edibles. Husband and I shared the pretzel provolone fondue, which was the perfect size and pretty amazing. I'm fairly certain he would have drank the cheese straight. My mule was weak but had really nice flavor regardless. Take note, they do not serve in copper mugs due to numerous thefts. My honey fried chicken was a little overcooked, wasn't very honey'd, and the mashed potatoes were too thin in texture. His fried fish were too salty and oily. The next day, my father-in-law informed us that he's had the best prime rib dip in his life here. I knew, I shoulda gotten a sammy!

I love the Ladies' and Mens' doors and how they dump out into the same room. I walked in to wash my hands and spent the minute or so watching the door at all the double takes of the opposite sex being in the same bathroom. I also really enjoyed the live music and nice lighting. We parked over by the Starbucks in the Bashas' parking lot and risked our lives crossing the street at night, so we didn't have to deal with the mandatory valet and the after-meal wait to get the car back. Pick your poison wisely.

p.s. Would it kill you guys to do a high pressure hose down of the bags occasionally?? Those things are GROSS."}
{"text":"This was the only downtown restaurant with good food that wasn't $$$ that I was able to make a reservation for a Saturday night on the same day. Besides that, I liked that the menu offers a variety of meat and vegetarian options, they serve alcoholic drinks for those who want them, and the service is reportedly fast. I was worried about the noise level, which was justified, but everything else was fine: they quickly brought our four different grilled cheeses that we described as spicy, \"like a burger,\" sweet, and complicated; generous side salads; and bills that were $30 per couple. We even liked the tomato soup. As a plus, they had the Colts-Steelers game on, too. -1 star for having to shout through dinner."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  I really like the set up here and the menu.  Its basically similar to culinary drop out, another place I really like.  Where to sit does depend on the weather, and they have a  lot of fun games to play.  My personal favorite is bags.  
A great place to go with a group, to watch sports, just to have a meal.  This place ticks a lot of categories.
The one bad thing I would say is that it is not open that late.  So for those of you who party till 2am, this is not the spot.
Lots of drinks, not really a place I would get wine but almost everything else.  
Younger attractive crowd here generally."}
{"text":"Came here on a super busy Saturday night - that being said, the service was great and though the restaurant was bustling, it made for a pleasant environment. There's so many options for different types of grilled cheeses, with choices for vegetarians, meat lovers, seafood lovers, etc., and everything is reasonably priced. 

I ordered the cheesy caprese with tomato soup and a side of cajun spiced chips. Personally, I didn't love the sandwich simply because it was super buttery and I prefer healthier options and don't like food being too oily. However, the perfectly toasted sandwich and flavorful chips made the meal a guilty pleasure, and I definitely want to go back and try some of the bolder flavors. The soup was also delicious and on the thicker side. My friends ordered sides of mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and especially loved the cinnamon dip the latter came with. This isn't somewhere I would frequent often just because of how heavy the meal was - otherwise, a great place to try out new sandwiches."}
{"text":"Damn you! I've been disappointed for the last time. Please don't invite me to the yard. Because I'm likely to turn you down. The only good thing about my last few visits has been the company and the cocktails. My kid really likes the yard, but only because of the ping pong tables. He doesn't really eat. Not that the food sucks or anything but the service is terrible and the wait for a table is always atrocious. By the time we get seated and someone finally comes to take our order I'm usually ready to go. I'm grumpy now just thinking about it. Bah. Humbug."}
{"text":"While visiting Pittsburgh from NY had the good fortune  of dining here. Excellent gastropub. Food was great with an awesome beer selection. I highly recommend this establishment if you're in the downtown pittsburgh  area"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my birthday (party of 15). When I made the reservation I was told they only have two times of the day and they were inside ( 11am and 6pm). I was not that crazy about being inside, as all the action is in the yard. I made the reservation and soon after we arrived on Sat evening Will advised he could move our entire party outside..woohoo! That made my day! From there on out the rest of the evening was great! The food, drinks and the service was great and we look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to check out The Yard for brunch after I saw all the ads for their brunch on Facebook. Let's just start by saying if you want to feel rushed and not enjoy quality brunch time with family/friends, this is the place for you.

While the food was good I was extremely unhappy with the service. Fantastic that you can turn around someone's food in like 5 minutes but that doesn't mean we like to eat and leave within 30. I watched the waitress come over to the table next to me and tell them that they had a lot of people waiting at least 15 minutes for tables. So she essentially asked them to leave when they were trying to enjoy some bottomless mimosas. 

The hostess then came to our table questioning who sat us at the table and proceeded to tell us that they had a reservation at the table and plenty of people waiting for tables. At this point it was clear this is how this place turns over tables so we just left. The chances that we return is very slim. I planned a brunch because I wanted to spend time with my friends but instead I felt rushed. I checked my watch and we were only there for an hour so I'm not sure why they thought it was ok to make us feel like we needed to leave because we overstayed."}
{"text":"This place was highly suggested to me from someone at my work, I had been so excited to go so I dragged a few friends with me. We were able to get prompt seating, but the music was so loud it was hard to talk and discuss the menu. I got a Moscow mule to start and it was not very good, Primanti's on the other side of a Market Square makes a way better one! I also hate places that serve chips as a side, not only that but you had to pay extra to switch it to something else. I got the Frank The Tank sandwich. While the flavor was good of buffalo chicken dip, there was only one onion ring on the sandwich that you couldn't even taste. It just felt like a big blob of buffalo chicken dip on toasted bread, nothing worth paying $12 for! I was pretty disappointed with the place. It took a lot to convince my friends to go and we all left knowing we should have just gone to Primanti's."}
{"text":"Excellent decor, fun atmosphere, and good food. What more can you ask for! Not to mention the selection of beer on tap and number of grilled cheese combo is fantastic."}
{"text":"Sam Fox only cares about the money.  He could care less about the safety of his customers.  I know it sounds dramatic, but it is true.  There is very little parking, it has no real parking.  It is street parking and it is very, very, very limited.
The Yard consists of three restaurants so you would think that parking would have been made a priority, but making money is all that matters.
Valet is pretty much the only option.  I arrived on a Thursday night at 5:30 thinking that I wouldn't have any problems.  Valet was already full when I arrived.  Valet instructed me to park across the street, so I did.  I went to cross one of the busiest streets during rush hour (7th street) only to find that the nearest cross walk was 1/2 a mile north or 1/2 a south.  I braved it and made it across the street.
2 hours later and no sunlight, crossing the street with my children was quite a daunting and scary task.  After many \"eff\" yous and horns honking we made it across.
We called the restaurant and asked how they could be comfortable with directing people across the street knowing there wasn't any safe way to cross.  The person on the other end of the phone simply said \"I have to park across the street too and I just have to wait and run as fast as I can\".
Sam Fox, you suck for not taking care of your employees and the people who put money in your pocket.  Upward Projects (Windsor, Postino's, Federal Pizza, Joyride) cared about their patrons and helped get the city get lights up around their EXISTING crosswalks.   Take your money to Upward Projects.  It is always nice to know your money is enriching people who about you right back!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" for business casual and friend lunches. Love the originality in the menu, the side tomato soup and the homemade chips. Atmosphere is loud enough so you don't have to be worried about being overheard while at the same time not requiring that you to scream. A little hard to find at first but follow the signs to the upstairs. Another great \"find\" on Market Square in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place... David and dalton (yup road house) made us welcome and took care of us during the cup

Consistently good food great service and great support!!!!"}
{"text":"Being that The Yard is within a 5-10 minute drive from our house, it really is one of our favorite places to go. We love the atmosphere, it's always lively and the service is generally pretty good. The games there are fun, although I will say that the human sized jenga really needs a coat of polish or something haha, those things are not easy to pull out from one another. All in all, there is quite a bit I like about the place. However...I will say the food is always kind of meh. I have some things I like there, such as the crispy shrimp caesar salad & the pretzels with cheese fondue (ok these are honestly super on point), but some stuff has been super disappointing such as the buffalo chicken meatballs (I want to like these SO bad...but something about the taste is just not great) and the cap'n crunch french toast (on the brunch menu, honestly didn't taste the cap'n crunch part of this at all and the dish is overall really dry.) It's too bad the food isn't super great because this place has the potential to be even bigger and better than it already is, and we all know Fox restaurants are generally amazing. In the meantime, we will continue to go every once in awhile for some drinks and the few food items we really enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much! Was visiting my best friend from college in Phoenix and she lives close to this establishment so we thought we'd check it out. So happy we did! Awesome, fun environment! They have a really big bar so it was easy to belly up and get a few drinks. After we ventured over to the yard portion of the building-so cool and suuuper spacious. Ping pong, bags, foosball...there might have even been pool (I was a little tipsy at this point so I'm not quite sure). Great location to entertain friends though! Was not disappointed and I really wish they had one of these near me in Wisconsin. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to stuff yourself. We were excited to try The Yard at the Galleria. We arrived on a Sunday evening and they had a 20 minute wait which was fine because they have an area for you to sit and order drinks & appetizers (aside from the bar). 

The atmosphere inside is super cool. An industrial yet inviting feel. I would love to come back here for Happy Hour during a Pens game to watch on one of their many TVs. Every server in the restaurant was amazing as well! Very helpful and friendly. I would give 5 stars if I could stop here.

We had an appetizer of Buffalo Chip Dip which was delicious and a great portion. You can get pita or chips. It's a little spicy, but we like that!

Now onto the main dish. Obviously we all got grilled cheeses because that is what we are here for! Each grilled cheese comes with tomato soup and a side (potato chips,  fresh fries, Mac n cheese, tater tots, onion rings). It is cool because you have different seasoning options for the sides too. We each got a different side and they were so good! My Mac n cheese was amazing. 
However, the Grilled Cheeses were unfortunately not good. Mine had 3 layers of cheese and was just a hard brick of cheese. The bread was greasy and made my stomach hurt immediately. The sandwiches were just too large to even be able to enjoy. If you are into greasy, messy, hard sandwiches, then you will enjoy this. I will say they have a TON of different options for Grilled Cheeses with chicken, pork, and vegetarian. The tomato soup also lacked flavor and was not thick enough for me.

Honestly if this was not a grilled cheese joint I would give 4, maybe even 5 stars. But I cannot get over how unappetizing all 4 of our grilled cheeses were. I will definitely be back for the atmosphere, service and apps. However, I do not see myself trying a Grilled Cheese again."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout--Will never go back! Went there last night and our waitress seemed annoyed the entire night; like we were inconveniencing her when we even asked for water. Food was average and several items needed to be sent back because they were wrong...then to top it off we were double charged for the items.  There are way better restaurants with better service (an less pricey) to go to in North Central. Would not recommend eating there.

The Yard--fun atmosphere and good if you are just going for drinks! If there is a band playing though it is next to impossible to hear the person speaking next to you!

Little Cleo's--Would definitely go back...went in there after Culinary Dropout last night and it was a completely different experience! Wait staff was awesome, food was great and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Staff is unfriendly and rude.  It made the entire experience extremely unpleasant.  One of the waitresses walked up to our group and told us we were \"suffocating\" the tables around us.  We were in shock with how rude the staff treated us and their other customers.  Also note that you have no choice but to park through their complimentary valet.  Further note that if you order something just before happy hour ends at 6 p.m. on Friday, you may not get the happy hour price.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"First time I have ever been here and I just loved the large patio area and fire pits to hang around. You need to have reservations in order to get a seat anywhere because it is a very busy place. We ordered food from Culinary Dropout & I had one of their BBQ bacon burger and it was one of the best ones I ever had. They also have a great selection of brews on tap to chose from. There are bean bag games and ping pong tables but you need to reserve them when you get there. They have free valet parking so keep in mind the parking can be a real issue when it gets busy since there is not much anywhere else to park."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love Culinary Dropout.
Good drinks and food is awesome. 
It gets busy but the staff will help you out if you just ask them for what you need."}
{"text":"I've been to the yard more times than I can count. While the atmosphere is nice, I just don't like the food. You may love it, but I dread going when my friends suggest it.

The pretzels and beer cheese is good.

I've had burgers and salads and they've always been just okay, and expensive. Lunch is always $15-20.

I had the grilled cheese sliders most recently and they were absolutely disgusting. I was expecting good cheese, or a couple different types of cheese, but instead it tasted like Kraft singles and had a nasty texture. The cheese with the grainy tomato and bacon was all salt and no flavor.

I also wish they had more local beers on draft. Culinary dropout is okay, but at the yard for lunch? It just doesn't mesh together to me. 

I wish the yard had a separate menu from culinary dropout-or a lunch menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food, the atmosphere...I love it all! This is a great place for any meal and any occasion. Happy hour is pretty darn good and the sangria is spot on. A few of my faves are:

Pretzels & provolone fondue (a must!)
Turkey pastrami sandwich
Grilled cheese sliders
French fries
Any of the drinks!

Great place, highly recommend for brunch, happy hour, dinner, drinks!"}
{"text":"This is a must go place in Pittsburgh. Sometimes I think I hype it up in my head but still worth going at least once. I go for the classic Mac and cheese grilled cheese (forgot the name). While it is a lot of food and carbs it is something unique. I also enjoyed the unlimited mimosas 

I wish they would have a few lighter or better salad options though. I get why they don't but it would be nice"}
{"text":"Would I go back to The Yard? Yes. Was I 100% satisfied  with my meal? No. The bread I had on my sandwich was toasted in a toaster not like a traditional grilled cheese. The sandwich needed more toppings on it. If I'm spending over 10 dollars on a grilled cheese, I expect it to be loaded with cheese, meat, veggies, ect. The chips were a bit burned and seemed reheated. I've been to a gourmet grill cheese restaurant before and this place was sub par compared to the previous place I'd visited in Cleveland. I've been to the downtown location, not sure if Shadyside is better. The soup that was with my sandwich was good. The menu is large, great ideas, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I wait for my check. Here's some of the problems with my experience tonight: I was harassed by management; I did not get a drink for 30 minutes; I only got one drink the entire time I was here; the food was terrible; the servers were extremely rude and incompetent; and it's been 30 minutes that I've been wanting to pay but haven't been able to. This is a horrible experience and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Food was good with the exception of the burgers. Everyone's was overcooked and dry. It's definitely over priced for the food, but the atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I've been here many times despite finding it very very overpriced. 

I always get the same sandwich everytime because I find it that appetizing - it's called \"Smack Yo Mama\" which is BBQ pulled chicken, bier cheese, onions etc. it's amaaaazinggg. Super overpriced for a grilled cheese sandwich but somehow I was drawn to buying it way more often than I should have. 

I also really enjoyed the Mac attack appetizer which are fried Mac and cheese balls which come with a chipotle dipping sauce. Honestly if you're not feeling too hungry, they're filling enough to be a mini meal."}
{"text":"Ambiance=5 stars. Service=3 stars. Food= 4 stars dependent upon what you order.  I have been here a few times and love the atmosphere and the fact they have games. The food is decent, but not up to Sam Fox' s normal standard. This place is mainly about the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Multiple bad experiences with this company.   While they have a great venue (venues) they are never accommodating to ANY special requests.  Coming from the industry I understand not needing business in busy times, but not being able to get a group reservation on a weekday without spending a minimum and having to guarantee an outrageous minimum is ridiculous.  Every FRC Dining run venue is the same.  So if you are couple looking for a place to eat out great, but come with more than a few friends, plan on a long wait and having to scramble yourself to find tables, there won't be any help from the staff."}
{"text":"The Yard really is a great place with very good food.  Sam Fox has the Midas touch and every concept he opens seems to kill it.   Great atmosphere and a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Pro's- fun, unique, good food.
Con's-HORRIBlE HORRIBLE parking, staff is really hit or miss as far as friendliness and being helpful. The bathroom is different....."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews on here are either love-it or hated-it and I suspect that it mostly has to do with how crowded it was when they were there. I was lucky and came here for a work event in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday. So, no parking issues and there was plenty of space to lounge and no wait for games. I can see how it would get a little crazy if there was a ton of people there but really since it is outdoors with plenty of seating and drink-resting tables I think no matter how full of people The Yard gets it is still way better than most bars that try to cram some games into a small space or someplace like Dave and Busters that has them indoors so it gets crazy loud and super annoying. I definitely would not come here for a date night or if I wanted a quiet dinner with an old friend but for a large group that wants to hang out for a while and drink without getting bored, this is a great place. I didn't try any of their many specialty cocktails but most people were raving about them. They had a decent and reasonably priced selection of craft beer and wine. Also, a fair amount of Mexican beer, too. That, plus their pretzel fondue = four stars in my book!"}
{"text":"We hosted a large group of coworkers here for dinner and I was a little nervous about how the quality of food was going to be (family style); however, it was AMAZING!! We had a few different salads, house chips, PRETZELS & CHEESE (omg), ribs, mash potatoes, fried chicken and biscuits. ALL OF IT WAS AMAZING!! Service was fantastic, even for having a large group.....MK was one of our servers and she was outstanding.
Highly recommend for a fun, laid back environment!! We had a blast and will totally return!!"}
{"text":"Once your inside this is really a fun place! I say this because it's kind of a pain turning in here off of 7th if your heading north, and of course they only have valet. 

Unfortunately, I didn't try any of the food here. I say \"unfortunately\" because 1) I guess this place is basically Culinary Dropout, which I've never had food from, but I hear is really good! 2) The night I came here was the first time I was drinking in over 5 months (well...drinking more than a single beer, which I had two nights before), so food would have been good. 

This place is huge! The patio is ginormous, and it's a really cool atmosphere. There's tables, couches, fire pits, games, and even a little beer tent, which I took advantage of. It's not that our server was slow (she was just fine). It was just really convenient to walk over to the beer tent and easily get a beer when you want one. Also, this place has a really good beer selection! 

Yes, this place gets crowded (we where here on a Friday), but it's still really fun, and I would totally come back again."}
{"text":"Pleased with my recent visit to this newer location. They were busy on a Friday night at 7pm but we we seated immediately. Our waiter was very nice and funny. Service time wasn't bad actually. I know other reviewers were not happy with that. Part of my order was incorrect but the waiter fixed it promptly. There was some sort of water problem going on around the bar and they were mopping basically the entire time we were there but it didn't bother me. I had the 'shrooms sandwich and my husband the buffalo chicken dip sandwich. I enjoyed the shrooms and recommend it to those wanting something different. The crust of the bread was very crispy which is my only complaint. Buffalo chicken dip is pretty spicy so avoid if you don't like that. Also, there was tons of it on the sandwich as you can see in my pic. Would come back. Definitely check it out if you like gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Hh menu is culinary dropout's menu which I like. The atmosphere is a very laid back atmosphere and a great hang out spot! It was lot cuter than I thought. Based on the description of having ping pong and other games, I thought it was going to be grungier but that was not the case!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for drinks last night. Overall, we really enjoyed he place. Great mix of people and very cool layout. The service was attentive, especially for such a huge crowd. Guessing it is a challenge to keep everything straight when the place is packed....like it was when we were there.

Our visit was on a packed Thursday at the tail end of happy hour.  We figured it would be busy, but were amazed at how full this huge place was! Enjoyed a big 24oz can of Modelo Especial at the bar as Jeannie went for the house Pinot noir. We waited with our friends for about 15 minutes for a table.  There is lots of seating, but not sure if the couches and the play area are open to self serve.

Backing up a bit though...

Word of advice: Be prepared to either use the valet or park on a side street. We parked on a side street and felt lucky to find a somewhat close spot. Made the mistake of walking all the way around the front of the place only to discover the entrance is in the back.  Long trek if you are in heels....sorry Jeannie! 

Only ordered the pretzel balls since we had eaten earlier. They are pretty awesome, so save some room for those! 

My buddy and I decided to go for the beer in a bag. Planned on waiting to finish them then discover what we were drinking, however someone (cough...Jeannie! ) blew the surprise and unsheathed one after the first sip! 

Hard to imagine a place with more drink possibilities! 

Looking forward to returning. There is a bacon Bloody Mary that I have to try!"}
{"text":"The fondue with pretzels is amazing! Had the grilled cheese sliders, they are crunchy and tasty :) my new favorite place :)"}
{"text":"Like many others have echoed -- this place is seriously suffering from an identity crisis.  But truthfully, lots of Phoenix establishments do -- this one is just particularly shameless about it.

Who is this place for?  Certainly not families with kids -- my son and I waited for an hour just to *not* get in on any games.  Locals, foodies, older crowds, hipsters, college students?  None of the above.

The sheer volume of patrons must drive the locals nuts, with cars tucked away in every corner of the neighborhood and people wandering through the streets like zombie lemmings.  Foodies are gonna be seriously let down by the food, which is a notch above Chili's.  Older folks out looking for a vibrant meal sure will get that with all the pushy patrons and their kids running around.  I think hipsters and college students are immediately disqualified because of the prohibitive cost and patience/persistence required to get in on any of the games.

This place is seriously expensive -- borderline outrageous -- for what you get in the ambiance you get it in.  I have absolutely no problem paying $50 for the perfect bone-in fillet -- but paying $22 for a some kind of cooked-to-death sliced meat over gorgonzola cheese with a side of fries (fries!) is robbery and a violation.

So, I guess the perfect demographic would be young and obscenely rich parents that don't have to do any parenting -- those that use social cues instead of taste buds to decide if what they are eating is any good.  The nanny gets to hover over the children and wait for games to open up, while the parents get tipsy on $15 sugar water.  Good thing the valet is free -- they'll pull their Expeditions right up for them.

So it's either those people or maybe college kids with trust funds and nothing better to do?

Pass."}
{"text":"What a fun place. Valet parking, a great outside covered patio shared by 4 great restos! Had lunch at Bario which was good and then played some ping pong in the yard. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place a lot. However the service is below average most of the time. I had to wait an hr and 15 minutes for a burger and didn't get a sorry or anything from the server. She seemed very uninterested and lacked passion which hurt the overall experience. Overall I will come here again, but just for the beer and games."}
{"text":"On my way to the Pirates game and I decided to take my family to The Yard. I will never regret the choice because my father is a big beer connoisseur.  The beer selection was never ending and great plus their twist on a grilled cheese is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I think the atmosphere is unlike any other in the area. Not to mention, I think the turkey pastrami sandwich is delicious! It's my favorite! The pretzel bites with warm cheese is also top notch."}
{"text":"The ambiance is the main reason people come here or atleast i'd think so. The outside yard is the major selling point. Theres games, and a nice environment. Good for dates and good for hanging out with the guys. Culinary dropouts in the building so if you want better food than bar food you have some decent options. The menu at the yard itself is really limited and is pretty dissapointing but overall this place is a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Upstairs restaurant in Market Square was a good spot for a bite before the Penguins hockey game.  It's not a large space but adequate with a long bar and tables throughout the long but narrow space.
TV's are all along the bar area, service was friendly, efficient, and fast.  I like that our server actually asked us if we liked what we ordered.  This used to be a usual thing but not so much anymore.  My husband wasn't going to complain about his beer option but since she asked if he liked it, he had to be honest and said \"not so much\".  Well, our server promptly said \"no problem\" and she'd get him something else.  She insisted.  How nice is that?!    I ordered a bloody mary and requested celery.  It was ok, nothing too special about it but oh, how I did appreciate the celery with it.
On to the ordering.  The menu has lots of grilled cheese options so we both selected one of them.  I opted for the mac-n-cheese grilled cheese.  They all come with tomato soup and chips.  The sandwich was good but so very messy with the mac-n-cheese oozing out everywhere.  I think I would rather have had just the mac-n-cheese without the bread.  The tomato soup was good but was not a very large portion at all.  Chips were good -- I ordered them with parmesan cheese on them.
The noise level was a little louder than average -- not bad but it was filled with Penguin hockey jerseys and it was a bar/restaurant and everyone was happy so it was to be expected that it was not a quiet venue.  
All in all this was a decent place to grab a bite and brew."}
{"text":"This place is great for groups! We went for some late night eats and took advantage of their reverse happy hour menu. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue are delicious! I wish I had a cement truck full of that fonndue to pour on everything I eat!!!"}
{"text":"I took friends there who were visiting from out of the over the weekend. They were very pleased with my recommendation. We all enjoyed the food, drinks and atmosphere. It was a good Pittsburgh thing to do before the Steelers game. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The place was busy we brought in a big group and even know it was difficult for them they found a way to get us a table and accommodate us.  Very much appreciated

It's a great venue with great food great beer selection and the staff is always fast and friendly"}
{"text":"I was glad former co-workers decided on this spot for our gathering because I had wanted to try one of these sandwiches that many people were marveling about. 

I decided to get the \"Simple Jack\" with is ultra cheesy grilled cheese sandwich with four types of cheeses melted on thickly cut Texas toast served with a side of tomato soup and homemade potato chips. I'm a self proclaimed cheese-a-holic and this was an excessive amount of cheesy goodness!  
If you love a good tomato soup and grilled cheese the Yard won't disappoint you. 

One day I'll visit again to try some of the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Is this review inflated by the fact that we were both starving by the time we got here? Sure. Does it take away from the fact that the food was pretty damn great? Nahh. 
So many options for any type of meat lover and then some for seafoodies and the herbivores out there. Bar had so many craft local beers on tap and cans/bottled. All sandwiches came with some pretty tasty tomato soup which tasted a little more like marinara sauce? But that honestly a plus if anything haha. We ordered the cheesy caprese and the laferty daniel. Both were so flavorful, toast was buttery and warm, and the cheeses and sauce were rich and plentiful. Great by itself or dipped in the soup. Chips were interesting, cajun spiced or garlic herb topped. Price was decent too. Staff was quick, filled waters in mason jars for us and had our food out quick. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been going to Culinary Dropout at least once a month--sometimes more often--since it opened at the Yard. Love the food...so many dishes I enjoy, esp the bistro steak, Korean style steak, salmon, meatloaf, ribs.  Nice small menu, good for brunches, good beer and wine selections"}
{"text":"Well I was excited about this place but it is so loud I can't hear anything.  Asked for a beer and got a warm glass to put it in. WHAT!? A warm glass for beer?? Yup that sucked. Food was good had the yard burger cooked perfectly and my friend had the wake and bake.  It is St. PATRICK'S DAY so maybe that's the reason it's so loud."}
{"text":"O.....M.....G.... Visiting from Oregon I stopped in with my best friend who is rather a food snob based on her recommendation. It was ridiculous.

A playful menu with creative yet logical ingredients. I would have gladly payed twice as much for half the food.

Thanks Shannon, and thanks to the crew!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The yard is in between three different bars. They have a \"yard\" in the middle of the bars that have comfortable seating, corn hole, ping pong, jenga, photobooths, etc. This place is super fun if you're looking to bring groups of people or if you want to relax and play some games. The one bad thing is that you can only bring drinks into the yard from culinary dropout so if you eat at another one of the restaurants, you have to finish there, then get a drink at culinary dropout. Other than that, it is an awesome place to be!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was terrible, I went there on a team builder with my company and the bartender was rude and the servers had no idea what was going on. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Fun place with great service and good food. Valet parking made parking very convenient and they also ensured that the experience started and ended great."}
{"text":"The Yard is like a big recess for adults at night so it seems.So weird to see three restaurants in one place, does it work , does it not work..well it was packed even though one can not find easy parking. Obviously, when placing the The Yard and the other restaurants in one place, FOX didn't think about logistics.  So what if you have to walk in the middle of the night in the dark, people will still come. And they did. 

We had a large group and even though a reservation was made days before, they weren't very accommodating in the end.  Drinks were overpriced even for a soda and cider.  Service, well I felt for the girl who had to run around quickly to all the tables and groups.  I tried the pretzel dish, I've had better.  They were pretty hard and the cheese wasn't really the greatest.   I ended up not eating there, because again, our area didn't have enough seating nor tables to do so.  Others said they were not impressed with their food either.

The ping pong  area was fun, however a group of pretentious hipsters decided to stand right in back of us, so a lot of the balls would hit one of them obviously..did they try to move or say sorry..yeah no. Sounds like recess back in the day! 

Would I go again, maybe for a drink but I would not wait any amount of time to get a table for any of the restaurants, when there's other places right down the street, just as popular and able to seat us right within a decent amount of time - 45 minutes to an hour is way to long!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location of The Yard. I enjoyed it the first time and a friend wanted to try it. She had never been to any of the locations. It was a freezing cold day so what sounded the best to me was The Simple Jack. It was a 4 Cheese Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup and chips. The sandwich came out and the cheese was just oozing out of the sides. YUM. I cut the sandwich in half and picked up half to eat and the cheese stretched forever. MIND BLOWN. I fell in love in the first bite. The combination of the four cheeses was perfection. The thickness of the bread held up to the huge amount of cheese. Plus it was toasted to perfection. 
The tomato soup has a great texture. It's not too watery or too thick. It has a lot of flavor that tends to lean toward a pasta sauce flavor. I liked that it wasn't your typical tomato soup. 
I could have done without the chips. I love how thin they are but they hold the oil they are cooked in so that is what they tasted like. Next time I would either have them hold the chips or try the fries. 
This lunch was total Comfort Food. Who doesn't love Comfort Food??"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. A tad loud though. I prefer their quieter locale in Scottsdale, but the space is very cool and is an impressive place to take someone from out of town. Go!"}
{"text":"Well they don't have enough parking, but I immediately let that go walking into the place because it is an awesome set up. 

The problem I have is with the service, and I don't even blame the severs. I blame whoever came up with their stupid policies. We tried to hang on the side that has all the games, but we wanted to eat something. And their policy is that if you order food you have to stand at the bar until the order comes out. So we had to give up the table we were at to wait at the bar. I asked if she knew how long it would be. \"I have no idea, there is no way to tell\"? So forty minutes later after we asked twice, the food comes out.  We got to eat standing since we were forced to give up the table. Why? 

I can think of so many solutions to this dumb, dumb policy. Why not have a runner bring the food out? Why not text me when the food is ready? Why do I have to wait at the bar when you took my card already? Why not get one of those pagers and let it buzz when the food is ready? 

Anyway, I'll definitely take this post down, and return, if a manager at the yard realizes how ridiculous this policy is and does something about it."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Leaves so much money on the table it's Crazy!

Cons:

1. NO WIFI?!!!!! For the prices they're charging this is inexcusable. Server said they were told it was because it may \"overload the staff/management wifi,\" and that a lot of employees \"use laptops around the restaurant.\"  LOL.

2. Valet parking only. Street parking mostly limited to residents.

3.  EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOOD AND DRINKS.

4.  Small TVs, most of which have a glare.

5.  Poor bar service. Bartenders talk amongst themselves rather than serve the very few customers at the bar.

No wonder this place is mostly empty."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas are great! They keep your drinks filled the whole time. On the other hand, I  got a waffle that was not good. It was too hard and difficult to eat. I would go back just for brunch drinks though!"}
{"text":"For starters, I absolutely LOVE the concept/vibe of The Yard-- outdoor games (ping pong, corn hole) and seating with food from Culinary Dropout?! So good. Some reviewers below me have mentioned that the service at the yard was pretty meh-- my group didn't notice any issue with that! We had a couple of servers who were around very regularly, and some people ordered food.

The reasons why The Yard gets three stars from me are: (1) it's always PACKED on weekend nights. Sometimes it feels like you're actually cattle in barn, not on a cool patio, and (2) there doesn't seem to be any system for the games, other than that you have to check out the equipment from the host. My group was there for 2.5 hours last night and no one got a chance to play any games! Pretty lame."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were amazing!!! Definitely a fun, five star establishment !! From bags to fine dining, our happy hour was perfect. The service was fast, friendly and funny! I will definitely have another happy hour here as well as refer my friends!"}
{"text":"I am no longer a fan of The Yard. The valet parking is a major issue, it fills up and then you have to park across the street and play frogger trying to make it back across 7th st. The drinks are overpriced as is the food and the place is always filled with kids. I don't go to outdoor patio bars to have screaming children running at my feet. I love children, and if I was going to Peter Piper I would expect the raucous. Unfortunately this has prevented me from being able to take advantage of the fun games they offer (ping pong, corn hole and shuffleboard). 

Perhaps I go too early but any later and you are waiting 2 hours for a table. No thanks. (But yes I will probably still go there because I can ride my bike when the weather is nice and sit out on the patio)."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Culinary Dropout last night for drinks and the live music. At about 9pm on a Saturday night there was a 30 min wait, so we skipped that and sat at the bar. Roberto was a fantastic bartender, attentive and remembered everyone's names. He joked with everyone and created a great atmosphere. 

I ordered a Moscow Mule, it was strong and delicious. My friend and I also ordered the nachos and soft pretzels and shared them. They're always yummy! 

One of my fav local places."}
{"text":"really not impressed. the garlic parm chips were basically homemade potato chips with cheap parmesan thrown on them, didn't taste any garlic. The tomato soup had the consistency and taste of jarred pizza sauce, there were six of us and of the three of us that got it we didn't eat it. I got the cheesy capresey and it was like they toasted bread and threw the tomatoes and mozzarella between it. the bread was hard. It wasn't cooked like a true 'grilled cheese\" no butter on the bread to make it delicious. It like cut the roof of my mouth. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The grilled cheeses are out of this world. I got he Big Che- Bowsky and my wife got Mac Attack. Yard cho's Bros for an app."}
{"text":"Busy establishment. Two places in one. Workers are not really friendly but food is good"}
{"text":"I finally got to experience the wonders that is The Yard. I attended an event for the PT profession here and I had a great time. To my understanding, The Yard itself is the area where there is Corn Hole, Pool, Jenga and all the other games. Culinary Dropout and Barrio Urbano are two different restaurants that are attached to the Yard and you are free to move about the entire complex and order food while sitting outside. Pretty nifty concept if you ask me.

There were multiple bars around the entire space so it was not too difficult to get a drink. The food and drinks were good and everyone had a lot of fun mixing and mingling. My only complaint is that the parking sucks. Your options are valet, limited street parking adjacent to the restaurant, or parking in the other small lots across the street. If you luck out with a parking spot great, otherwise you may have to brave a sprint across 7th Street hah. Definitely a spot to check out and a place that I will visit again."}
{"text":"My wife and I met some friends here for drinks and appetizers. The vibe is more of a look at me, I'm so cool thats why I'm talking so loud feel. Had the house margarita but really wasn't too impressed. You can get better for less elsewhere. Also had the pretzel bread with cheese fondue. Cheese was just luke warm but the bread was tasty. The noise level was kind of off putting. Free valet parking is available. There are some other restaurants at the same location but never could figure out where they actually were, are they just three different types of food at same place? Confusing. All in all food was average as was the staff and service. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"We arrived from out of town starving! Came across this restaurant and wanted to give it a try.  They have a very large beer selection. I started off with a Bloody Mary that was decent. We ordered the nachos with chicken.  The shredded chicken looked  suspicious.  The melted cheese was from a can, and there was very little salsa. I asked for more and our waitress came back with a 2oz cup full?  My husband ordered the grilled cheese. Our waitress forgot to put his order in. The main reason for the 2 stars is I went to the restroom which was located by the kitchen. The kitchen looked very dirty and there was a mop bucket next to the bread that was lined up against the floor.  If I had seen the kitchen prior to eating I would have left."}
{"text":"My experience at the Yard reminds me of the Seinfeld episode with the rental cars:

\"See, you know how to take the reservation. You just don't know how to hold the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anyone can just take them.\"

I made a reservation for 16 people for a Friday night at 6 p.m. There was torrential downpour that day, so when they called to confirm my reservation, I requested we not be seated on the patio. They then proceeded to talk the patio up BIG TIME. Nice, warm, secure, super covered. Plus, there's tons of games and great ambiance. Needless to say, I was pretty excited about the patio then.

We arrive at the restaurant. They're busy. That's expected. However, they could not accommodate my reservation, especially not on the patio.  After about fifteen minutes, they sat us inside and attempted to do so at two entirely separate tables. I said that wouldn't fly, so they jammed all of us into the tiniest space possible. Not the best treatment for a large party with a reservation.

Our server was great and very apologetic. She was super attentive. However, no one from management ever came to apologize. The place is also insanely loud. I had to shout at the person next to me. Then a live band came out and the place got even louder. I'm only 27 and it was too loud for dinnertime, if that says anything.

The food was just average, except for the kale salad and pretzel bites. Quite tasty. The drinks were phenomenal, but overpriced for size and alcohol content. I had a free birthday dessert--the tort. It was very good.

I'll give the place another whirl, but not with such a large party. And not on a Friday night.

P.S. The bathrooms will throw your for a loop. Parking is ridiculous. Just do the valet."}
{"text":"ALright so I have only drank at this place so this review is based solely off of alcohol and environment. I love the place. Drinks are quick and easy to get, and how can you not love the atmosphere? Bags, ping pong, foosball. The only thing preventing this from getting 5 stars from me is that their are way too many kids running around the bar on the weekends. I understand parents want to be able to drink and have their kids with them, but it is uncontrolled. Kids. Are. Everywhere. We try to watch what we say because we don't want to cuss in front of children or anything, but seems a little unfair because we are going to a bar to have a good time and it is a little annoying to have to censor and monitor our conversations at a bar. Otherwise, great place"}
{"text":"Disappointing first time lunch eating at The Yard. The food came out incredibly fast and was not warm, let alone hot. Grilled cheese (Monte Christo and Mac Attack) were soggy. The side dish of brussel sprouts was $4 and contained only 3 brussel sprouts, the rest was all burnt flakes. After delivering our check, the server didn't come back and we had to ask another server if we were supposed to pay at the hostess stand and she took our check for us. Before tip $35 for a disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel roll! The beer selection is ok, the mixed drinks are better. The only problem with the place is that it can fit many more people than they can serve. ideal for drinking and playing games with your friends. arrive in a cab. Have fun and drink responsibly."}
{"text":"Love the concept of a grilled cheese restaurant. So many options and the tomato soup is amazing."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good, food was great. Our waiter was courteous so I am not sure what happened with others. I did enjoy that they had all the games available but we weren't able to grab any. Frustrating, I know, but these things happen so people should probably relax on that one."}
{"text":"The soft pretzels with fondue are amazing!!! Had the grilled cheese sliders for my meal, highly recommend! Love this place and the atmosphere! Great for a weekend hangout!"}
{"text":"I only come here for two things: Trivia Night and Whiskey Wednesday. Luckily, they are the same thing! Trivia night is casual and fun (damn you Trivial Dispute!) and select whiskeys are a lower price (anything normally under $7 is $4). The whiskey selection isn't amazing (especially if you are only looking a the marked down ones, but I have consistently found some good ones, and you can't beat $4.

In terms of food, I like the pretzels a lot! Oh, also, if you come for trivia night, your team might want to reserve a table."}
{"text":"The food was just OK.  Nothing special.  It took forever to get our meal. The service was horrible.  I was asked if I wanted more coffee but I didn't get it until my food was almost gone.  The service really needs to improve.  My waitress would disappear for 20 minutes.  Oh, valet parking only or street parking.  I would go back for a casual lunch or happy hour but not for \"special occasion\".  Not good enough for that."}
{"text":"2 of us arrived at 730 and was told it'd be a 45 minute wait. We ended getting a table 5 minutes later. Our waiter was great, super friendly and attentive to our needs thoughtout the meal. We were in and out of there in an hour which is nice. It was quite full, the bar was packed and there are plenty of tv's too. We started off with a couple drinks, the Liquid Encourage-Mint (tasted great but very low on the rum!) and a Blonde Walked into a Beer, a blend of 2 beers, orange bitters and honey syrup.  We started off with an order of the Poutine, as a Canadian girl this is something I can't resist. Nice big bowl of fresh cut fries covered in a stout gravy, not usually my favorite but this one was mild and I loved it. Lots of cheese curds that melted all over it and a side of beercheese (yuck, not my thing ) For our entrees we went with the Hail Caesar and the Dr. Dobak grilled cheeses. The Caesar tasted just as described, a Caesar salad turned into a grilled cheese sandwich. I will say the chickened did not taste blackened to me, but nevertheless it was tasty and tender. I loved dipping this sandwich into the tomato soup...a perfect match! The Dr. Dobak was stuffed full of tender and juicy short rib meat and cheese. Overall it was a great meal, not cheap by any means, but good food and good service are worth a nice weekend meal."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good reviews regarding the yard. I figured I would have to try it out. Who doesn't like grilled cheese little lamb gourmet grilled cheese? We visited the Market Square location. It was very busy and I am glad I made reservations ahead of time. Highly recommend making reservations if you plan on going on the weekend.

There were so many gourmet grilled cheeses to choose from I wasn't sure what what I was going to pick. I ended up getting Slap your Mama. I must say this was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. The chicken was tender and moist with just the right amount of sauce. I also ordered the chips along the side. The chips were a little overdone but still very tasty. The soup was not my favorite but it was okay.

This location is tucked away but definitely a must go to! Will be back."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about the yard and I wasn't disappointed. It was a little louder than I expected, but the menu is incredible, I'm not sure I've ever had so much trouble deciding what to get before. There is a very good beer selection as well.  I wound up getting one of the grilled cheeses, and it was delicious.  I would definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! Had a group of kids (8 yr olds) in town for a hockey tournament. The yard activities kept them entertained between the corn hole & ping pong tables.

Happy hour prices were fantastic. That chopped salad though??? So good! Very friendly staff. Came at 4pm so it was not that crowded yet. Will definitely come again when come back into town."}
{"text":"Nothing but the best of things to say! From the minute we walked up the stairs and were greeted at the host stand to sitting down at the bar on a busy Sunday and given the best service. Unlimited mimosas never ran out, they were so on top of filling them up and the glass was never empty and the food was SO good. Such a great place for brunch!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I wanted to check out The Yard as we had drove by it a few times and it looked like a great venue (love the outdoor area, swanky yet laid back- love the games). The valet line was crazy long and we were quoted 2 hours, 15 min later I got the text that our table was ready- no complaints here and we took our beers and pretzel fondue to the table. I thought the appetizer was good but nothing to write home about. We were stuffed before starting though so just got salads. Mine was great (super fresh), minus the slightly overcooked tuna. We had the peanutbutter pie that was to die for! What really sold us was our AMAZING waiter Jeff. He was always around without lingering. He gave great recommendations and realized I hadnt eaten the tuna without me saying anything and brought us out the pie. With service like this we will definiltey be back!"}
{"text":"Climbed a thousand stairs (escalator broken - long line for elevator) to the attic of The Galleria to eat at The Yard. The restaurant sits directly above BRGR, which has to frost the owners there. The space looks pretty barebones and utilitarian... we sat at the bar & perused a menu of four dozen beers on tap. I don't get it. Doesn't every bar these days have a big selection of drafts? Even Primanti's across the street does. The specialty of the house is gourmet grilled cheese, which we ordered despite the fact that I once ordered a grilled cheese at a restaurant & my best friend said \"You are absolutely NOT ordering a grilled cheese. If you want a grilled cheese we will go home & I'll make you one.\" These were advertised as \"gourmet\" grilled cheese sandwiches and we found them to be fine, but not life changing. What wasn't fine was the tomato soup that seemed like that thick, gross, concentrated stuff with an odd chipotle taste added. The homemade potato chips were a salt lick and therefore absolutely inedible. The bartender was fantastic & the rest of the staff seemed nice as well.  I think we might try again sometime as there is maybe more interesting stuff on the menu. But only if those dopes at The Galleria fix the escalators."}
{"text":"I dig the yard.  It is my go to place for out of town friends and family because it is a real crowd pleaser.  Laid back but fun, cool decor, lots to do, great food and drinks.  All that makes it an easy choice!"}
{"text":"Great place out in Arizona! If you are looking for an outdoor, relaxed atmpshere with good dishes, and even better brew, check this place out. Be sure to get there early to stake up your spot on the patio though, it's the best spot!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese is my favorite food so I may be biased. I had an excellent meal there and I ordered something off of the vegetarian based part of the menu. The soup I could pass on a hundred times over but the sandwiches are worth getting every time. And the music was bumping. I loved it, currently my fav spot in town if I were to choose a favorite."}
{"text":"This is a very unique place. Large open interior with many games like ping pong and enclosed areas on the sides with different bars and restaurants. Really fun place to take a group!
Parking is a bit of an issue. You can valet but otherwise there are almost no spaces to park."}
{"text":"Wish we had a place like this in San Diego.  We went on Sunday afternoon and got very good service and food.  While we waited for the food I got to play ping-pong with my son.  The salads were pretty good, burgers look good and the rib dip sandwich that I got was excellent.  The place is so big that I can understand why when it is very crowded service can be slow.  However, just watching all of the nice people and waitresses should make it worth the wait.  The place is very cool with a lot of attention to detail on everything from the sofas to the bathrooms.  Fox Restaurant Concepts really knows how to create beautiful restaurants."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Fox spots (love him or hate him) that really is a shift in the bar/restaurant concepts. It's an adult playground, an oyster bar, a spot to listen to music, a sports bar, and a transformer of the neighborhood (since the yard there are many concepts in walking distance that add to the variety of what to do when one idea gets played out, which is hard to do at the yard, and the hood before the yard was far from a destination spot). They are consistent in execution from drinks to food, clean, hospitable, and entertaining. Really the only thing I could ask for is a few more menu items at Dropout. I feel love had everything 3 times already (probably have) and a few more entrees would be welcome in my book."}
{"text":"Had a nice Friday dinner. Kind of noisy but expected. Food was really good but the service was a little slow"}
{"text":"Its like an old all american backyard gathering...if you want to sit and eat, you must do so at the Arrogant Butcher = the main house in this metaphor. Pretty cute though, love the concept."}
{"text":"My friends birthday party is why i ventured out to the yard. From the time i drove up i was not impressed. They have free Valet but it was filled up and so were all the places they told me to park. Not to mention all the police who were parked around this place waiting to give you a $70 parking ticket for parking on the street! I ended up parking across the street in a closed dark auto parts place. Then having to cross 7th st in what i called a suicide race to the other side- not great.
      
Once we got across the street we had to figure out where to enter - entrance is in the back - by valet. We went straight to the bar to meet my friends. It was very packed and i did get service rather quickly - i got the pinot Grigio on tap which i thought was very cool - but my glass had lipstick all over the top - when i pointed this out she poured it out and gave me another glass which had less wine in it. I felt like she was punishing me for there mistake. 

We proceeded to order food - we started with the pretzel fondu appetizer this was mediocre @best - i think they microwave the pretzels! And the fondu was beyond salty - know i was looking forward to having dinner here - that excitement ended with the appetizer. We had to order everything @the bar then take it to the area where my friends were because there are no servers for the back. 

Know your standing @this place because there is not enough seating. When i went to the restroom it was confusing because its unisex - i have no prob with this when done right. The bathroom was filthy and there was a broken bottle in my stall - so gross. 

Overall i did not like the yard - it was overpriced and customer service is non existent. Why 2 stars not 1 ? They did have a sam adams promotion and we got free T- shirts which was cool and i did like the pinot on tap- just not enough to ever get me back in that place."}
{"text":"4 stars for ambience, 2 stars for food, 3 stars for liquor/beer.  Great looking cool spot with ping pong, shuffelboard and cornhole.  Food all sounded great but was just mediocre. Bloddy Marys also disappointed as was the beer selection that was dominated by Bud-Miller-Coors with only a handful of good craft beers.  So much potential but this place left me wanting more."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible. I had the mac and cheese grilled cheese and it was mind-blowing. I don't even remember what my husband had because mine was so good. They have quite a few beers on tap. The only downside is that the look of the place is a bit dated and the temperature was high. We wanted to stay for more beers, but it was too stuffy to do so. But go for the food! It's well worth it."}
{"text":"The name of this place says it all. If you're looking for a quiet or upbeat place to chill after work, you probably don't want to come here. It's loud, for one thing. You can't even hear yourself talk. The selection of entertainment isn't anything to do cartwheels over either.

If you want to watch a game or hang out with a bunch of rowdy people, this is where you want to be. Nothing really sucks here, but nothing really stands out either. It's a great place for those just looking for a good time.

Just make sure you're sober before you enter, or you won't be finding your way in to begin with!"}
{"text":"I came in with some classmates during a Saturday downtown exploring museums. We were lost and a little confused, and the host wasn't super nice considering. 

However, once we were seated, the server was very friendly and accommodating despite the complicated nature of our visit to the yard. I am limited on what I can order, so I simply had tomato soup. It was the best tomato soup I've ever had, and certainly worth $5. Though, I should have ordered just a cup instead of a full bowl.

My friends ordered grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger. Everything looked great, but the grilled cheeses were not grilled. It was dry toast with lightly melted cheese. We were all disappointed. 

The veggie burger, while massive, was quite boring compared to other veggie burgers in the city, so I wouldn't come here for that.

Overall, I feel like my entire experience was just ok. It's not bad, but I wouldn't spring to come here over say, Burgatory. Even some other restaurants around the downtown location are better options. 

Maybe next time, The Yard. And probably not your downtown location."}
{"text":"Amazing place to hang out and meet other fun people.  Really good food and always have decent drink specials."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and bar food. We were seated within 10 minutes. Service was great, very prompt. I ordered the big che-bowski and subbed the chips for the Mac and cheese and wasn't disappointed. Portion sizes were large. Definitely will be coming back to try other sandwiches. Other members in my group ordered the Buffy Mac attack, the always Sunny in Philly, and smack yo mama. No complaints were heard so I'm thinking those are safe bets as well. 

The yard is also known for their \"almost\" bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's. There's a bloody Mary bar where you can put in almost anything you'd want! Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good bar food, good staff.  Great place in market square.  TVs are a little small for games, but if you can get a seat at the bar, they're great.

Staff also showed grace under pressure with a difficult client, which is always impressive. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"The management is super nice and the pretzel bites and turkey pastrami sandwiches are awesome. I always order one of those items with Yamazaki scotch. The place can get super crowded, so I would recommend making a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese ever, I had the \"always sunny in Philly\" fantastic!
My husband ordered the Wang Chung, also very good. We had the sweet potato fries and the garlic parm with our meals....would have given it 5 stars but it was so dark we could hardly see the menu (used the flashlight on our phone) and no AC so it was quite muggy and warm to the point we wanted to leave as soon as we were done"}
{"text":"So many of my Pittsburgh friends have raved about this place but when I went there for brunch last Sunday I was not impressed. First of all the menu is all fried, double cheese or french fries, gravy, tator tots with everything.  I ordered the poutine as I was going the unhealthy route and also craved comfort food as it was 23 degrees F out and snowing. They did not use real cheese curds, they used regular cheese. I guess I could not get my taste of Montreal there. The unlimited mimosa's for $15 tasted like Sunny D and very little flat champagne or probably $5 bottle of sparkling wine. Even after 3 of them on an empty tummy I felt no buzz. I do not see what this place is all about."}
{"text":"Didn't have food but played all the games at the yard. Excellent setting.  Perfect for mingling."}
{"text":"I was visiting friends in Phoenix and we came here to meet up with other friends and it was so much fun.  We were able to find a spot in the middle to sit and visit and it was very comfortable and relaxing.  There are all sorts of games to play and be entertained.  I love the atmosphere and it reminds me of being in college.  The crowd is relatively young.  It's a cool, trendy spot to meet people as well if you are single.  I had the pretzel balls dipped in cheese that were so tasty with a cold beer.  My boyfriend even tried to replicate it when we got home.  The staff was always very helpful.  It can get very crowded at times and during those times the staff is not always attentive. Overall is a very social scene and a fun place to hang out and have a few drinks, eat some food and meet people.  Parking can be tricky but they do have valet."}
{"text":"The yard is a great place for HAPPY HOUR! They have a great beer and wine selection during happy hour, I usually get the girly beers: either a Wild Blue (blueberry beer) or a Stella Artois but my brothers and hubby get those strong, adventurous beers. Every server I've had has been really cool and is helpful with their beer suggestions. It always seems like they are just one of your friends. The happy hour food is awesome! I've tried pretty much everything, but ones that stood out were the pretzel balls and cheese, the meatloaf sandwich, salmon bruschetta, and french fries. Basically it's all good. I love the whole concept of the Yard. It's like going to a friend's place that has coolest backyard. Swanky outdoor furniture, Italian string lights, plus ping-pong and cornhole. That's really all you need for a good, chill afternoon. It gets pretty busy during happy hour on Thursday-Friday, and you can find many well-dressed downtown hipsters here. Happy hour is only at the tall tables, so I would recommend getting there early if you have a bigger group. During the weekdays happy hour isn't crowded as bad, and that just makes for faster food and drinks. Parking is pretty crazy sometimes, last time we waited in line for a while just to get our car valeted, but it not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Place was crowded, parking sucks.  Drinks are weak. Ping Pong tables and paddles are worn out.  Cool Concept but they should ad more games. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best bar and restaurant in the South Hills. Jess , the manager, makes sure that the customer enjoys the experience . She goes over and above to accommodate everyone. I will keep coming back because of her and I will tell all of my friends and family about it . 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time to catch up with friends from high school, great and casual atmosphere. It was quite loud but that we enjoyed that aspect. Sports vibe and very family friendly. 

We had the buffalo chicken dip appetizer, very yummy with a good kick to it. The entrees are massive though, so an app isn't really needed. I ordered the Buffy the Mac Slayer grilled cheese, and loved it! Bread didn't get soggy even though there was a TON of Mac and cheese on it. Also loved the tomato soup and homemade chips with garlic Parmesan! 

One complaint -- the bartender(s) need work. Between the six of us, we ordered four different cocktails. Only mine was good, the others weren't even drinkable. I ordered a 2nd one of mine, and it was completely different in the worst way. Didn't even drink a quarter of it. Basically, there's a big lack of consistency in their cocktail preparation. Fix that and I'd give it five stars."}
{"text":"I was invited to the soft opening of this restaurant a few months back and had an amazing time: attentive service, awesome food selection, and great drinks. 

I've been back several times since then. I've decided I like The Yard but I have to prepare myself before going in. Here are things to expect: 

1) Slow service - through no fault of the waitstaff or kitchen, the place is so massive and fills up that food is slow service is slow, not exactly sure how they plan to fix this but it's something to be aware of when you go in. Self serve bar is the best option to get fast drinks, and come in only mildly hungry because food will take awhile so work up an appetite while you wait.

2) 10-20 Minutes wait to park - they do have valet, but during peak hours (4PM on), you'll find a long wait just to get to valet. No parking anywhere in the area, so might as well just wait in line. 

3) Price - I've been for happy hour and the prices are good during that time, after that drinks can be pricey depending on what you order. Do some research before hand on their site. 

4) Food - The menu is seemingly diverse. I had the fish which was a decent entree. Appetizers like the chips with onion dip and pretzels with fondue cheese are good bar food. I'd give the food 3 out of 5 stars, it's pretty good but could be better. I was hoping for more diversity in the menu and higher end produce. 

Overall the ambiance is awesome, definitely a hot spot to be seen in central Phoenix, great bands, cool bartenders, and awesome location. Downsides are service, wait and price... but I have to expect that in a larger city restaurants that draw in so many people like The Yard does would have similar downsides. 

I recommend the yard, but caution those who want something quick and cheap. The Yard is not the place for you. If you're looking for an awesome experience, don't mind waiting and can deal with the parking situation - The Yard is your spot!"}
{"text":"Terrible service - rushed our table and the table next to us (I saw those ladies complain).  As soon as we sat down waitress wouldn't even let us look at menu - wanted our order.  Didn't refill drinks.  Still eating and she came over asking if she could get us boxes.  They weren't busy and we were there for 40 minutes start to finish.  Food is just meh - tomato soup is not great.  Sandwich very greasy.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been a few times. I like the atmosphere and drinks and their poutine is pretty darn good. The customer service is awesome and they have an overwhelming amount of beers on tap. I think I keep coming back for the atmosphere and the French fries. Once I had a turkey burger here and I wouldn't recommend it unless asking them to make sure it was well done. That's my only complaint.  I bring a different group of friends with me every time I wander to the yard."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Culinary Drop Out was for lunch, I had the fried chicken entree which claims that \"It takes a little longer, but its worth the wait\". Well, its not. The chicken was dry, chewy and tasteless. The biscuit was moderately better, but not worth the calories. The gentleman server was really friendly and informative.
The 2nd time visiting, I sat in The Yard with a group of 6. 5 of us arrived early and ordered drinks and appetizers (deviled eggs), which were decent. The ($4-5) prices for the small plate appetizers were a pleasant surprise! 
Our Suicide Squad waitress (this is actually a compliment to her) wore black lipstick and cleavage up to her chin, seemed fairly distracted/bored when the first 5 of our party sat down. After the 6th guest arrived and sat down, (he ordered a water to start), I asked if he wanted to taste my drink. He took one sip before Suicide Girl came over and scolded us for 20 minutes about how she can loose her job and how uncool we were. 
FYI- Its never charming to have a 20-something scolding 50-somethings over and over for 20 minutes without coming up for air, in fact, it was completely unprofessional and ridiculous. We sort of chuckled at her and apologized, to which she stomped away and stood staring at our table for a good 10 more minutes with her bouncer. After never coming back to the table and wondering when the temper tantrum was going to end, our 30 year old daughter went up and finally asked for the bill, since they refused to take our order (claiming our 6th guest was a child). Ironically, the waitress never checked his ID and we were out celebrating his 21st birthday!!
Too bad for her we had planned on ordering plenty of food and drink, but took our business elsewhere.
I would never return to this establishment again, based solely on the behavior of one awful waitress.
They say, every person has an average of 200 friends. Guess how many folks Im going to encourage to NOT spend their money at this dump?"}
{"text":"We held a team building event here. I thought the atmosphere was perfect for what we needed it for. There were plenty of corn holes for all to play (teams) and then we held our murder mystery even at the picnic tables (plenty of space). Fire pits, ping pong, there is plenty to do and something for everyone.

I can see coming back here for a family fun event or a night out with a group of friends. And the outdoor patio vibe is perfect for Arizona weather. 

Oh and the bathroom is a trip. You gotta experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"The shady side location is a million times better although I have never been there with a large party. A friend had made a reservation for a large party for a birthday they told her she would have the entire bar area reserved for the party. . When we arrive they had two tables for us which was great, but the bar area was not cordoned off for us. It took 1 hour to take our drink orders then an additional 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive. After that it took 30 minutes to get the waiter to come back to even start taking our dinner orders. It's currently 8pm and we haven't even gotten our second round of drinks let alone our food. (We didn't even attempt to order an appetizer.)One of which was a bottle of wine. We have eaten at The Yard on multiple occasions. It doesn't seem to me that they are equipped to handle a large party. 1 server for 20 ppl. 
I can honestly say their food is delicious though the service is sub par. If you have a large party."}
{"text":"I mean honestly... The Yard... you've stolen my heart. I seriously LOVE this place. How can you not?! Complimentary valet, live music, food, drinks, free photo booth, ping pong, giant jenga, foosball, corn hole, picnic tables, fire pits, dining areas both in and outdoors, a resident kitty that roams around, YOGAAAA!!! WHAAATTTT!!! 

I mean honestly I can't say enough about this place. Omg. I just CAN'T!! It's the only place in existence (or at least that I know of) that literally screams \"cater to the customers\"! Whoever owns this place seriously knows what he's doing - remarkable! They have thought of EVERYthing and no matter how many times you go your experience is always different, which I personally enjoy. Sometimes service can get a little shaky, but with the mass amounts of people that are always there and the constant movement I don't hold it against them, they do pretty darn good!

I recently went for a morning \"bend and brew\" yoga sesh. We got a free pint after yoga - amaze balls! We also decided to stay for breakfast - I had the breakfast burrito and it was to die for. I've been craving it ever since!

The ONLY two things I don't necessarily care for is that there's no pool table (hello!) and the bathrooms, mainly because I've often been \"checking\" myself in the mirror and guys walk by muttering comments like \"you look great,\" \"you look fine\" or something of the sort and that's kinddd of annoying. Like mind ya business stranger! Psh.

Anyway, if you haven't been I highly suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the fried green tomatoes grilled cheese. Service was excellent. The place is very small and it can be very loud and crowded quickly. I wouldn't recommend the bottomless mimosas because they were $15 but other than that, highly recommend"}
{"text":"We just left The Yars and had great food and even better service. 

We got the poutine fries which were so flavorful and absolutely delicious. The fresh cut fries weren't greasy, the gravy was full of flavor, the cheese added creaminess and the beer cheese took it to a whole different level. 

We also tried the heirloom tomato tartlets on their special menu and they were so good! They also were extremely flavorful with tomatoes, goat cheese and cranberries. It was sweet, salty and savory and the flavors complimented each other extremely well. They were delicate, light and beautiful. 

I am a vegetarian and wanted to try something different, I got Yinz Guys Hungry? Without the sirloin. The sandwich itself didn't have much flavor, but I assume that's because I removed the meat. I got onion rings and fries as my sides and enjoyed both. 

My bf got The Big Che-bowski and loved it. He prefers his bacon a bit more crispy than how it was served, but that's completely personal preference. He said even with that, it was absolutely fantastic and he would get it again. He had waffle sweet potato fries which were served with a cinnamon butter that was really fun and tater tots. Both of which were again really good. 

We really enjoyed the food, but the service was incredible. The gentleman and woman who waited on us were attentive without being overbearing, knowledgeable, accommodating, helpful and professional. They genuinely treated us like family and friends which makes such a big difference. 

We look forward to returning and trying different things!"}
{"text":"Here from out of town for a meeting. Chef Scott is creative and does an amazing job of blending flavors that are comfort foods done is a cool way. You have to try the caramel corn, it's to die for. Great service and atmosphere. You won't be sorry you tried it!"}
{"text":"The Yard at the Galleria recently opened.   The menu seems to be the same as the other locations.  There are about 40 beers on tap.  About 20 TV's above the bar and a few around the large open space in the top floor.  The arched walls/ceiling are black but with the large window and opening to the remainder of the Galleria, so it is very open.  The menu has some interesting combinations for cheese, meat, chicken, turkey or veggie with some interesting toppings.  My Dr. Dobak sandwich come on Texas toast thick bread with both provolone and cheddar cheese with a large amount of Short Rib, an Onion Rigs and Strawberry onion jam.  I really enjoyed my sandwich and the short rib but the strawberry jam made it a little sweeter than I expected.  The tomato soup that came with was good and the homemade potato chips are perfect."}
{"text":"I really hate giving poor reviews, but I have to when food makes you sick. 

My mom and I came here after some shopping at the Galleria and we both ordered some of their gourmet grilled cheeses. They tasted okay, more like a sandwich than a grilled cheese, and I took my leftovers home. 

About an hour later, something just wasn't right in my stomach, and you can guess the rest. I have a stomach made of steel, so I was nervous when the onset of symptoms came on so fast. Finally after a couple of hours, I relaxed and my mom called me late at night and said she was having similar problems. It was AWFUL.

Nothing really else to say about this place, one bad experience can taint it forever!"}
{"text":"The food here is okay but not worth the slow service. Someone in our group got their entrée before any of us had drinks.  The manager on duty was Extremely rude to my group and we left prematurely because of it. Will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was Flint British Motors. Forget the Kawasaki/Ducati days: That's newbie stuff. I remember looking at Spitfires and MG's under that enormous awning. Remember them? Stopped selling them in the early 80's.

Anyway, the food's as good as one might expect from Sam Fox. The service isn't the fastest, but keep in mind the utter enormous size of the place. On a Monday night our server (who looked like a model, in keeping with the Sam Fox MO) had to tend to a sparse crowd spread across something close to a city block. The server kept her cheery demeanor despite looking forward to running the equivalent of a 5K on her shift under the nicely-cooled awning.

When the food arrived it was delicious. No complaints from anyone in our party. Try the fried chicken. It was not only the special, but it was actually special.

Yes, they have games. I guess they're fun. I lack hand-eye coordination so I limit my fun activities to motorcycles and guns. But have at it!

Parking is valet-assisted. When it gets busy you're going to want to use it. Parking in front of Planned Parenthood and running across 7th Street is a bit unseemly."}
{"text":"I went here with girlfriends for lunch on Sunday to indulge in grilled-cheese goodness and nurse our hangovers. They had mimosas pitchers and over 20 different grilled cheese sandwiches along with salads, burgers, soup and appetizers. They also had a wide selection of beer to choose from including seasonal drafts. The service was attentive even though it was packed with people watching Sunday football at the bar and our food was great. I'll definitely be back when I venture out to Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Good food, AMAZING atmosphere,  fun times! Shuffleboard, cornhole...what else could you want? Tons of fun for a night out. Slade is THE MAN! :)"}
{"text":"When trying something new, I have learned not have any expectations, positive or negative,  until I have experienced it for myself. Otherwise, I've either felt let down because I expected too much or I didn't let myself have a good time because I nit picked everything.
Well for whatever reason I couldn't help but have high expectations of this place. Thankfully, it was one of the times where I was not let down!
I came here around 9 one night recently. I had heard about the long waits, so I had held off for a while but finally broke down and dragged a friend with me after work one night. She parked on the street, I valeted. For as busy as it was, my friend said there was plenty of street parking, I just wasn't paying attention. There was several cars in front of me, but the line moved fast, and I only had to wait a couple minutes before it was whisked off by some kid who probably just got his license last week (not complaining about skill, he just looked barely old enough to drive).
We walked right in and put our name on the list and had about a 30-45 min wait (which turned out to only be 25 min) so we walked to the bar ordered a couple drinks and went and sat in the adirondack chairs by the ping pong tables. We sat, talked, watched people playing ping pong and having a good time. The atmosphere was loud, fun, and happy.
Once we received the text that our table was ready, the hostedss walked us to our table and introduced our server who was friendly and sweet. we asked for recommendations and wound up ordering some cheese and pickeled peppers to start which where delicious.
For our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the corn canneloni. Wow! Seriously, some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. Light, buttery, flaky fish with flavorful, crunchy breading. My friends canneloni was delicious as well, I only tasted a bite (I was surprised I was allowed that much) so I can't go too in depth about its deliciousness, but I would definitely order it for myself next time.
The portions were big, I took one piece of fish, half my fries and all my cole slaw home and she took almost half of her dish home.
For pickeled peppers, cheese, fish and chips, canneloni and 4 glasses of wine, our bill was $68. I don't know what people are complaining about. I really don't.
The prices are typical, the portions were good sizes, the drinks were big, the service was impeccable and valet is pretty standard for central and downtown Phoenix. I absolutely loved the Yard and can't wait to come back. All of you haters can go back to your suburban Olive Gardens and Applebees."}
{"text":"Beer and fancied up grilled cheese sandwiches. Perfect. We hit up the market square location a couple times a month during the workweek for lunch and the service is always on point. 

The mother of dragons is delicious. I'd face a Dothraki horde in an open field just to get one. 

The best sandwich I've had there was a special. It was a take on a sloppy joe. Let's go ahead and add that to the menu full time."}
{"text":"I actually took my time going to The Yard due to the craziness this place got when it first opened. We ended up going to Little Cleo's and had a great dinner. I'm not a huge fan of the Fox Concept restaurants, but we had a great experience at Little Cleo's. We wanted to stay around to play some of the games, but didn't have the time. We will definitely be back to have the full Yard experience. I am a sucker for Cornhole and Ping Pong so this place is calling me back for sure. We didn't have any problems with parking and the wait for games didn't seem long so don't get discourage at some of the reviews."}
{"text":"The design and concept Is fresh and fun! We didn't didn't eat much, but what we did have was good."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. Definitely try the pretzel and fondue. Super good. I had the fish and chips. It came with a side of coleslaw that was the best I've tasted. They have an indoor and outdoor area. Way too loud outside."}
{"text":"An old motorcycle shop converted into a restaurant and massive yard, is a great addition for the neighborhood.  Great food, drinks and a chance to be a kid again.  The Yard offers a space for customers to play bags or ping pong in an adult setting.  Whether you are here for dinner or drinks, Culinary Dropout does not disappoint.  This is a unique concept and this location tends to get crowded fast.  They offer free valet since parking on the streets are a no-no.  Brunch is a fantastic way to start the day. The Biscuits & Gravy or Egg Sandwich are great eats.  For the kid at heart, I recommend the Cap'n Crunch Crusted French Toast.  It's sinfully good!  Don't forget to add a Bacon Bloody Mary to your order.  

The Grilled Cheese Sliders with Sweet Potato fries are delicious.  I highly recommend the Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue as a starter.  This cheesy goodness will melt in your mouth.  

I hope that everyone gets a chance to stop in to The Yard. Patience will be needed since this is a popular place."}
{"text":"WOW ...
The only only problem was the price was high and not reasonable. Great place for friend hung out and spend some time"}
{"text":"Generally I'm a fan of this place. It's always fun and I love the concept. It's a great place for a date or a group.

I've only ever been at night (so maybe it's different for brunch/mid-day) but the reason I don't give it 4 or 5 stars is the noise (usually due to live band or music playing too loudly throughout). It's entirely too loud to have a conversation with anyone other than the person next to you. Normally this wouldn't be an issue in a bar environment but this is the kind of place that appeals to groups. 

I love that there are multiple restaurants to chose from and comfy couches/arm chairs clustered in the \"patio\" area. The service is always top notch and the food is solid. I definitely recommend the cheese board and pretzels to start! Also love the drinks (if you are on a budget get the brown bag special or head to the make shift bar near the corn hole)."}
{"text":"I would have liked the opportunity to actually eat here. But unfortunately, we showed up tonight and were quoted a 30-50 minute wait, which is understandable given that it's a Saturday night and the place is clearly popular. We had a beer and watched the fun happening in the yard, things were fine. Then 50 minutes passed, and then 60 minutes passed and then 70 minutes passed. I think it's incredibly important to give your guests an honest and realistic idea of how long it's going to take to get a table, otherwise you're setting yourself up for angry customers. We left hungry after 75 minutes and a crappy beer. It's a real shame, this place has potential.

Edit: Its been a week and no one has contacted me, despite what the note below from the yard says. I'm still waiting for the text message that my table is ready..."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but this recent experience inspired me- FORCED ME, ACTUALLY. 

My wife and I frequently duck into this spot, usually around Happy Hour, as we wait for our 7yr old son to finish his karate lesson around the corner. 

It is almost always a pleasant experience, but then a couple weeks ago we had an episode that seemed doomed to be 1 of those \"YOU-WISH-YOU WOULD-HAVE-STAYED-IN-AND-EATEN TOP-RAMEN\" types of nights...

Our dinner began with us ordering a beverage item from the menu, only to have our \"server\" return some time later to tell us they didn't have it, and she made zero attempt to hide her irritation with US, as if we had somehow known. THIS HAPPENED 4 TIMES IN A ROW-so that after 30 minutes, we still had not been able to successfully place a drink order. We felt like we were pretty good sports in the beginning, but unfortunately our server had at this point decided we were not worth the hassle- so now we were becoming quite irked ourselves. Her new strategy was to suggest to us that we had possibly  had too much to drink, even though despite our valiant efforts we couldn't get a drink to save our lives.

At this point she not only asserted we may be intoxicated, but on top of that SHE KEPT TOUCHING ME- an unwelcome arm around my neck, a firm hand on my chest,  patting my hand, etc. While my wife was very patient with this blatant violation of my personal space, I was much less understanding- I knew my wife didn't care for it,  and I personally found it offensive. I politely  corrected the intrusion the 1st 2X, but after the 3rd, I found myself stating firmly \"FOR  THE 3RD TIME, STOP TOUCHING ME\".

While I remember her name, and am tempted to share it, I am choosing not to   because of what happened next with the manager, whose name I WILL mention. 

Upon my adamant  demand for the touching to stop, our server literally ran away to find a manger, whom she brought over to remove us. After listening to her creative historical revision, the manager-  gentleman named \"MIKEL BOSS\", then gave us the opportunity to civilly describe what had at that point been a very uncivil disaster.

Shockingly to us, he somehow was able to properly recognize we were telling the truth. He was professional, apologetic and hospitable- frankly his last name \"BOSS\" could not  have been more fitting. He offered to accommodate us inn several ways, all of which we politely refused- we weren't trying to get free food or drinks, and all we really wanted was to try and spend our last few minutes there in peace, but we knew we did not intend to return.

He somehow sensed this, gave us his card, and went out of his way to make us feel like a return trip would be 1 where we could all wipe the slate clean.

The reason this was so impressive, and the reason I am writing this, is because sometimes \"life\" happens. Maybe the gal was having a bad day, or maybe the table before us had already ruined her shift. Who knows? Maybe a lot of things.

 Sometimes a dinner starts off like a nightmare, sometimes a server draws a tough table, sometimes a couple draws a tough server. Sometimes \"life\" happens when you least expect it

What impressed us the most was the commitment to excellence he showed-  there were a dozen different, easier ways out for him, but he didn't take the easy way.
The point is that its not a huge surprise when things go wrong- it would be more of a surprise if they never did. Good service is not ensuring that something never goes wrong, because that's an unrealistic expectation. The question is, once an experience has gone sideways, will someone go out of their way to correct it? He certainly did. While we appreciated that the end of our service was handled by someone else, we still tipped the original server 30% on the tab- partially because we understand a tip is a bigger reflection of the customer than of the service, and partially because we don't know everything she may have been going through. 

As for the manger, in all truth we do not know him and had never seen him before. Even though this reads like a personal shout-out from a friend, IT IS NOT- he is a stranger. He just  happened to be a stranger who treated us like friends, and because of THAT, because of \"Mr. Boss\", WE WILL CONFIDENTLY RETURN AGAIN."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here! Super chill - lots of games (shuffleboard, ping pong, jenga,  fooze ball, etc.) for free! Only bad thing is that there is no time limit on checking out ping pong items etc so people who had the paddles literally had them for the entire time when I was there... Also, when I went, there was a lot of young kids running around and screaming... but it is over 21 only after 8 pm!"}
{"text":"The food is always excellent as well as the service. Some of the best waiters and waitresses around."}
{"text":"The idea of the Yard is great and it is executed well.  There is so much to distract you with cornhole, ping pong, and so much more. Both times I have been there the place is so packed you are waiting forever for a table if you want to eat and the next person to be seated is waiting at the table for you to finish up and leave.  Way too crowded to actually talk to the people your with. 
The food itself was nothing fabulous but was decent.  It's your typical American style food.  I have yet to try the seafood place that is housed there. Perhaps that would raise my opinion of this place.  Probably not though since my main complaint jus with the crowds. If you are in college or a young professional you might enjoy this chaos environment better than I have."}
{"text":"I went to The Yard last night with a group of 30 - 40 people celebrating a birthday.  It is a great venue for a large group gathering of this size.  However, the bar and restaurant part are too small for the crowd.  They need to reduce the game side and allow more seating.  The band and piped in music was too loud and pretty much impossible to talk to anyone including those setting next to me.

Unfortunately, I did not read some of the Yelp posts before going to The Yard.  We tried to order food and it took an hour before a server ever came by.  I tried to order from the bar ans was told they do not sell hot food at the bar.  Finally, we waved down the server after 75 minutes of waiting.  We ordered and the server took my credit card.  I had the gnawing feeling that this was a mistake.  

The food finally came after 45 minutes waiting.  I will say that the food was very good.  We ordered the cheap salad and fish and chips.  Well, another 30 minutes go by and the server does not bring the check or my credit card back.  So, we track down the server and ask for the check.  Another 30 minutes go by before she brings the check out.  Some of friends waited over an hour and still did not have their food when we left."}
{"text":"The snack game at The Yard is on point. Meat, cheese, and bread. What more could you want?? That alone should get you there, but wait, there's so much more! 

The place is filled with the best games. We're talking Ping-Pong, Cornhole, and other games that I vaguely remember but were still fun! 

You like cheap beer? Duh. Get the Paper Bag Special for $1.50. They give you a canned beer in a paper bag and it's like a mystery until you finish it! Every once and a while a Miller High Life sneaks in there, and you're like WHAT? HOW? I'M LIVING THE HIGH LIFE! Also, if you're lucky, they'll put a bucket of mini shooters in front of you and you get to pick a few out. Just wink at one of the bartenders and they'll know. It's like a secret code. Try it. If it doesn't work, you could at least get their number."}
{"text":"I've often driven by the Yard and wondered about it. I finally went for my sister's birthday party. It was the very definition of mediocre. The bar staff were really rude to me, but not my sister, which makes me think it was a sexism thing. I bought her a Partly Cloudy, which was alright. The beer I had (I forget exactly, some IPA thing) was just OK too. The fondue pretzel appetizers were just like the kind they have at Target.

But the people who come here. Man, I haven't seen this many Jersey Shore clones since the last time I partied in Arcadia (or as I call it, Scottsdale Lite). We played ping pong for about two minutes after getting glares from everyone around us. I guess I didn't smell enough like Axe Body Spray to these primates.

Also, the heavy police presence in the parking lot made me anxious to drink even a little and the people who drive on 7th Street think they are on Nascar. 

Won't be coming here again unless I lose a bet."}
{"text":"The bartender Alison was awesome! My friend and I had a great time at the bar watching Pirates, Penguins and basketball games at the same time."}
{"text":"Three restaurants in one spot. The yard is one of the best places to hang out with friends, drink a little, maybe some ping pong or cornhole. Ambiance is casual, flip flops, shorts and ready for good times.  
Culinary Dropout - Pork belly toast is awesome. tender and with excellent flavor. 
Little Cleo's Seafood Legend - Great variety of oysters. Their frogs legs are the best I have had. The warm jar of king crab & butter with grilled bread is expensive, but well worth it. 
Barrio Urbano - The Barrio Guacamole is very good. Thick chunks of avocado with perfect seasoning.  When they are making thier ceviche with young cocanut, get it. Very good."}
{"text":"I was beyond disappointed in the downtown location. I've been to the Shadyside location and had nothing but a great experience. Completely different in Market Square. 

My husband, toddler son and I stopped in while visiting the Christmas Market on Sunday afternoon. And my main thought about the place....if you're going to be the only grilled cheese restaurant in downtown then be moderately kid friendly! We've been to several other restaurants throughout the city and even directly in Market Square and it was easier to have a little kid with you. In fact, we've been to Pizziaolo several times with our toddler and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. 

I immediately had to use the bathroom and took my son when we arrived. No changing table, despite plenty of space. And the bathroom was actually pretty messy. 

Then we get to our order. We had to specifically ask for a kids menu after sitting down, but clearly we had a child with us so why not give it to us to begin with? Then we order milk from the kids menu which we got after our own drinks in an adult sized styrofoam cup filled halfway. Anyone with a kid will know that it's very difficult to let a 2-year old drink out of that size cup. Certainly not a kids cup. Then we order him a plain grilled cheese, from the kids menu, and it was exactly the same size as my order. The bread was huge! Good for anyone wanting to avoid paying $9 for a plain grilled cheese...just get the kids meal for $5. But terrible for a little kid! Why even have a kids menu? The homemade chips were good and I enjoyed my own grilled cheese but the bad parts of the meal overshadow the actual taste of my food. 

I hate to make this all about my kid but we have been to plenty of trendy restaurants in the last 2 years with him and had no experiences like this. I would have expected this from somewhere like Le Mont but we took him there in May and it was fantastic. A grilled cheese place should cater to all ages. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went to the yard, loved the environment and made the decision to sit at the bar. We sat there for a hood 15 minutes before I decided to help myself to the menus since nothing was offered to us, nor were we greeted for some time. We both had a drink and shared an appetizer. When we were getting ready to leave, I reached down to grab my purse off the hook only to see that the chair which my boyfriend was sitting in, one of the legs bent and he fell backwards onto a.poor lady sitting behind him. Once I assisted in helping him up, I quickly noticed employees shuffling quickly to remove 2 or 3 additiinal chairs with bent legs. He's a tall man at 6ft 6 but basketball build so not overweight.  Nobody came to assist, I had to ask for management. We were offered a free drink by Justin, NOT COOL! While waiting for valet to bring our car Hank the assistant general manager approached and  Very nonchalantly, said \" I hear we had a problem\". We're  leaving and yet again ONLY offered a free drink. Poor management, they could have handled this so much better. I don't  believe we'll be going back !!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new Yard location. Came here for brunch on a Saturday and the place was not too crowded. I started off with orange juice and my friend had coffee. I ended up getting the pierogies n' at grilled cheese as I have had that at their other locations. My friend got the fried chicken and waffle sliders. My grilled cheese was good, but it was drenched in oil. The tomato soup also had a pool of oil at the top. The chips were fine. I couldn't even finish the meal, because everything was so oily. My friend enjoyed her chicken sliders. I don't know if it was this location or what, but usually the food is not so greasy."}
{"text":"Came back because a friend from out of town was visiting. There was about a 45 minute wait when we went around 12:30, but they text you when your table is ready. So we just walked around since it was a nice day. I ended up ordering the Pierogies N' At grilled cheese and my friend ordered the Mac Attack.

This grilled cheese was so much better than the last one I had here. The pierogies were delicious and tasted amazing with the caramelized onions and sauerkraut. I was also worried the kielbasa would be huge, but they were were small bite sized pieces throughout. The flavor combination together surprisingly worked really well. The cajun chips were also very flavorful and crunchy. Just tried a bit of the mac and cheese that had fallen out of my friend's sandwich and got little bits of bacon which were delicious. 

Much more pleased than the last time I had came here. Also, very reasonable prices and very filling!"}
{"text":"I've done Culinary Dropout's Camelback location before, which I'd rate closer to a 4-star. The food is identical here, and executed exactly the same, so that's just fine.

I dug the charcuterie/cheese plate ala carte menu. Had some tasty cheeses that were served with a cherry paste sort of thing. 

The wait is long, but I give them credit for using a text message system that even lets you track how many parties are in front of you. The outside area is surprisingly cool, even in the depths of summer (at least around 9pm, when it was still 95 or so outside) thanks to powerful fans and good misting. 

The food is pretty good. I like the pretzel bread fondue and my go-to meal is the fried chicken, which is really juicy, though I wish they'd put a bit more into the mashed potatoes/gravy they have going on.

The Yard has live music pretty often, and on our visit, this was a pretty serious disadvantage. It wasn't just that it was loud. It was loud and pretty awful. Lots of different covers spanning all kinds of genres ensured that we'd hear some of our favorite hits from the 60s, 70s, and 90s butchered. Not pleasant, and we were excited when they went on break.

Our server was really nice and pretty well got everything right, and the food is definitely decent enough for a return visit... but to the regular Culinary Dropout, where I won't have to dodge a dodgey live band."}
{"text":"So a lot of people raved about The Yard. I have  always wanted to go, and ended up going there for brunch for my friends birthday.  

Market Square Parking is a beast in itself. I would park on 5th ave and consider walking. The location of the resturant is in a great spot and it will be crazy in the summer. 

This place does have stairs so if you do not fancy steps or have a hard time.. now you know. 

Food/Service: i ordered the french toast with nutella sauce. I was not too impressed with my food. The toast was a bit too dry for my liking and there wasnt enough nutella to provide a moist texture when you chew. The tater tots and sauage were good. However the presentation of my plate was very well laid out. I dont like when chefs just throw food on your plate. But i would come back for the drinks. Our server did very well becuase we had a party of 11 and she was very attentive.  

The bottomless Mimosas is what atteacted me to this place and it was awesome. I would recommend this place for that! Oh and their nectar nugget beer is great."}
{"text":"Great open concept layout. excellent eating areas. The only problem I ran into was that it took about 15 minutes to get a drink at the bar. Hopefully this was just a one time occurance."}
{"text":"Decided to give The Yard a try for some food and drinks before a show in the Cultural District.  Had the best sandwich ever- Poppin My Collar. I also loved how it came with a cup of tomato soup and house made chips.  The price was reasonable given the prime location in the city and amount of food."}
{"text":"Went to the Yard with a group of 5 on 10/4. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks. The beer list was good, and mine was tasty. One of the group ordered the sangria and reported that it was tasteless. 4 of us ordered sandwiches, one ordered a steak from the local menu. It took a very long time for our food to arrive, then we got 3 sandwiches and the steak. After we were halfway done the other sandwich arrived. I had the caprese, it wAs ok but somehow it was bland. I would try something else. Maybe it was first week problems, I'll go back, but the Yard was comparable to Primantis"}
{"text":"Loved the tomato soup was enough to share with another.  Complex flavors simple ingredients I would for sure go again.  Although the wait was a little longer than I expected."}
{"text":"We got to experience \"The Yard\" during the week - and it ended up getting a bit busy!  3 restaurants surrounding an open \"Yard\" that has great seating and a large area dedicated to games.  Great concept!  A co-ed washroom.  Complimentary Valet Parking (you choose your tip $).  

The restaurants are excellent:
- Culinary Dropout  
- Little Cleo's Seafood Legend 
- Barrio Urbano

We got to try all 3 - all have their strong points!  FYI Culinary has a great bar and staff, if you're a fan of avocado and margaritas Barrio, and seafood at Cleo's is excellent.  If you can make your rounds to the restaurants like we did, it's a great experience.  We got to meet the General Manager during the eve - great guy that was absolutely interested in us having a great time.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Oh goodness, where to begin?

40 minute wait for outdoor seating. 

Dried food. The chicken literally had a helmet shell. My friend couldn't cut into it. My chicken was also dry. The flavors really are all wrong. 

The only redeeming quality is that the staff is uber nice. So, I would say just fix up the kitchen, or go here if all you want is a wide selection of beer."}
{"text":"I used to live in Pittsburgh and now I find myself coming back because hubby's client is based in Pittsburgh. Hubby happened on this place by accident, I happened on it via hubby? 

Is this place good? Sure it is. Is it good for kids? It states that it isn't, but I saw some. Is it trendy, in a college sort of way, yes. Would I go back? More than likely. So why did I give it 3 stars? This place is trying to cater to a certain clientele. Those that work downtown and or live downtown. Prime real estate in downtown Pittsburgh isn't cheap. Knowing that, places like these will always pack their buildings because people want affordable dining right around the corner from where they live. I can't wait until hubby brings the kid here to dine. She would just love it."}
{"text":"This place was great for our pretty large group (12 people) to come after a conference in the Tempe area. It's HUGE and has a couple of different areas (bar with high top tables, lounge area, grassy part with games).  It has TONS of TVs, which was great during march madness.  They have a pretty standard new American menu with sandwiches, create your own charcuterie/cheese boards, nachos, etc.  We all got a bunch of starters and they were pretty good. The drink menu is extensive (I tried the jalapeno lemonade which was super spicy and sweet at the same time).  Fun place to start your evening if you're in Tempe for sure!"}
{"text":"Do not eat dinner here until they get parking figured out.  Huge huge huge hassle getting out.  I've never had to wait 30 minutes in line to get my car.  Total Bs"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like The Yard so much so that I have been there at least 4 times. After all, it's in my neighborhood, it's an amazing space, has a modern and appealing menu, and on paper is a really great concept.

Disappointingly, many of those things are forgotten when you experience the place.  First, if you've never been there, you likely will be confused about how to get in...what appears to be the natural entrance on 7th Street, has an a-frame sign telling you not to enter...as if you'll be able to read that entering off a busy road.  So, do your best to work your way around the block to find that valet off a side street entrance.  Oh, and that assumes that they don't have a sign up saying that the valet is full, therefore you need to fend for yourself and hope to not be towed.  

From the first visit, the hostesses never quite seemed too happy to be there...which is kinda their job, I thought...you know, to be welcoming.  So, at this point, if you're foolish like me, you'll keep going, rather than turn around.  Because the service gets worse once you're seated...

...On my first visit, I chalked the poor service up to it being a new venue, and probably even gave the benefit of the doubt on the second visit.  But after months having passed, and a couple more visits, I would say it's gotten even worse.  It's obviously a busy place, and while I want to blame the individual servers for being inattentive, I think it naturally has to be management's failure to sufficiently staff for such a large crowd.  As a result, when they finally get to you, they are physically and mentally taxed.  That said, it's nearly impossible to even identify who the servers are, in part because they are allowed to wear whatever they want, thus blending in with everyone else in the restaurant.  

The food, when you get it, is pretty good.  The drinks, some are very good, some not so much (I can chalk some of that up to personal taste).  But, again, those things get lost because everything up to that point is just greatly disappointing.

The best part of this place is leaving...

Save yourself the trouble and find someplace else on Yelp that has a more favorable star rating and more positive feedback."}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday evening.  They were not too crowded, in fact this was the slowest I have seen the place.  I have already reviewed Culinary Dropout  and the food is the same for The Yard.  By the way, the seafood place, Little Cleo's was doing pretty well.  Anyway, I met my friends from Tyler, Texas and their 2 kids.  They were real happy to find a place that serves adult beverages and has stuff for the kids to do.  They were so slow that nobody else was using the ping pong tables.  I never even tried before to play because of the crowds.  I will admit that two times they were so crowded that I just ended up leaving, but that's not their fault.  I love their seating areas with the green couches.  It was not really too hot with the misters and they had a couple of industrial sized evap coolers to help out.

We only had the pretzel bread with the fondu which was as wonderful as ever.  I have to say I like the beer selection.  They were out of my Prohibition lager though but I tried the Goose Head Belgium style beer and it was very good.  Then I tried the Hefeweizen, from Oak Creek in Sedona, which was also very good.  One thing I don't get though.  They have this wonderful brown ale in Little Cleo's that they don't carry at the Yard!  I wanted to go in there to have my brown ale while I was waiting for my friends and was not allowed because the \"guard\" at the door said It was only for diners.  By the way, the bar area was open, which I pointed out, but the \"guard corrected me, telling me that was not a bar area!  They turned me away even though there was not one person at the counter.  So I didn't get my brown ale:(  Anyway, this is about The Yard.  But, like I said, The Yard has plenty of good beers to be had."}
{"text":"Overall, this was a highly enjoyable experience.  I love the idea of featuring gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.  There were so may options for the grilled cheese, that it was almost overwhelming, but I was able to pick through and come up with a top choice.  What was had at my table was- the big che-bowski, the mac attack, the poppin' my collar, and the smack yo mamma.  I personally ordered the smack yo momma.  The flavors were all there and a great combo, but unfortunately, the chicken seemed a little on the dry side.  Luckily, the bbq sauce covered it up, for the most part.  My friend who ordered the mac attack, was disappointed in the small showing of Bacon Lardons in her sandwich - she was able to confidently identify two small pieces of bacon.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their sandwiches.  We all stuck with the homemade chips, which were what you can expect from homemade chips - better than from a bag. 
The restaurant itself had very trendy decor - Edison bulbs, exposed wood plank walls and ceiling structure in a dark gray/black color with a chalkboard special menu.  I was surprised by the amount of space and number of tables considering it's on the second floor of the building.  
One of the oddest things about the restaurant is the location of the bathrooms.  You have to walk past the kitchen and dodge servers with food to be taken out to get to them.  It was a little awkward and uncomfortable. 
Overall, it was a solid dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to go back there."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with amazingly inadequate portions. Poor service (can someone hire actual servers and not these hipsters who can't be bothered to serve anyone?) My boyfriend ordered a dish with brussell sprouts. What he got was four brussell sprout leaves. Pathetic. I don't understand how this place is always so crowded."}
{"text":"Great brunch and lunch spot. Awesome gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches. Get the poutin as for the grilled cheese our party loved the: smack yo mama, Mac attack, fried green tomatoes, crabby patty and mother of dragons if you love heat. Each sandwich was large came with tots or chips and a side of tomato soup. Many of us weren't able to finish the sandwiches because they were so big and had plenty of cheese.

We arrived with a party of 8 and the wait was 90 minutes. After about a 30 minute wait we were seated. Definitely get reservations here if you plan to come here for brunch. 

Highly recommend this place if your looking for great comfort food and great drink specials. They had a $18 Bloody Mary special which includes 8 refills. Located right in market square there's plenty of other places to check out to shop and eat."}
{"text":"Great customer service by Nate Diederich! Read my yelp review, approached me at the bar to show me a new app they are using to page cellphones when my orders ready so I can now leave the bar area and come back when it's ready! Can't wait to try the food! :) ill test it out here and if it works ill tell the rest of the Dodgeballers on Tuesday nights. Appreciate the Yard taking the time to remedy the situation just in the nick of time too..we were prepping to start trying out other bars where we are able to eat Tuesdays when league starts up again next week. Great work around."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite spots, located in a great part of phoenix, the yard/culinary dropout was once a Indian motorcycle dealership and a motorcycle mechanic shop is a local landmark in my eyes. From a 1.95 paper bag special to ma..meatloaf!?! This place has it all and the place to get away from the usual Applebee's and chilis. Plus free valet, come on and get off your butt and try the yard/culinary dropout. The Moscow mules are amazing, just make sure it's given to you in the copper mugs. The pretzel balls are a must purchase anytime you visit, and what more could I say, this place just has it all and should be on a must visit list for all who come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Definitely a weird experience. Sun's in your face if you get there at the wrong time of day, no parking lot so good luck on the street, and weird bathroom thing going on. Really good space for groups, though, and definitely a good array of drink choices. Not great for an intimate evening."}
{"text":"I arrived for lunch with two friends...no reservation, but..arriving at 11:30AM, on a Monday I did not expect a problem...
And...encountered no problem and got seated quickly in the Patio area.
Drink order was quick (good pilsner!)..I and another friend ordered the M.A.C. Burger. I wanted mine pink in the middle, got a well done...ordered fries, and it looked like enough to feed a three year old...way too skimpy on the fries. One of my friends ordered a different burger, wanting it pink-or medium...that to came well done with a child's order of fries.
I'd give my  first visit , on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best....a score of 6.
Would I return for lunch again??   Not for a while.
It is pretty noisy, too...so if one wants to do a \"business lunch\", that could be a problem."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews it sounds like a lot of kiddos are running around here during the day.  I have only been there after 7pm and have not had the same experience as those other reviews.  This is a great place to hang out.  You can create your own experience here.  You can choose to keep it light with a game of ping pong or cornhole and a couple of \"paperbag specials\" with the buds, sit around a fire pit and watch a game or if that is not your thing choose to sit at the bar inside or catch a table inside Culinary Dropout.  Either way CD food is served whether or not you choose to sit inside the restaurants or one of the Yard tables. 

Remember this area is still just a large covered outdoor patio and even with heaters on a chilly night you may still need a sweater. Or conversely in the summer it can get a little warm through here.  But it is not as hot/cold as it is outside the Yard walls.  

Don't let the fact that all the parking is Complementary Valet deter you. [Or the fact the line extends into the street during peak hours] Don't risk trying to park in the neighborhood as the homeowners are diligent about getting folks towed.  Just let the valet dudes do their thing, you go do your thing and tip 'em when your night is through. 

There is a lot of space inside the complex, which includes Miss Cleo's Seafood.  But if you are like me there can be a personal tipping point on the crowd level and have yet to stay after 10:30ish on a Thurs/Fri/Sat."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience.  Beautiful outdoor setting. Great ambience. Great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"This is a place to grab drinks with your buddies and have fun playing games! THAT'S IT. I was not impressed by the food at all, too expensive for the quality. Not to mention, my table wasn't clean and my water cup was dirty, stuff you don't pay attention when you're drunk!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer. Chips were a little well done for me. Ambiance is laid back and service was very good."}
{"text":"So confusing! I thought the yard was a restaurant.. Not even all it is is an outside area. I don't like that there's not fans outside, yes it's nice they have misters but in 110 is was too hot to play. I don't like that valet is mandatory either! I wish there was a waiter outside to offer drinks while playing instead of having to go inside and get them myself. I will write another review of the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Friend waitresses and awesome variety of drinks!

The rest of my party got grilled cheeses of sorts and we're very happy with the sandwich, soup and chips that came with it. I got a burger and it was cooked perfectly and came with a heaping pile of fries.

I was impressed by the cider and mead they had! I got a cranberry mead which tasted sweet and delish. 

This place is not for the health conscious but I made it work by not eating the bun and cutting down on the chips."}
{"text":"The Yard is a chain restaurant and I was looking forward to my first opportunity to try it. They occupy the top floor of the Galleria shopping center near the junction of Connor and Washington Roads.

I had some time to kill before my hair apt so I stopped over here to grab a bite to eat. While they are known for various grilled cheeses and drafts they had a good selection of salads and burgers to choose from. I was seated fairly quickly. My waitress took time out to explain the menu to me. I ordered the bison burger but I was a little concerned about the spicy sauce that comes with it. She was nice enough to put it on the side for me. Your utensils and napkins are in a holder in the center of your table so there's plenty for all my needs. The bar area is in the center of the restaurant.

All sandwiches come strictly with chips. You can for a slight upcharge swap those out for fries, coleslaw or even the vegetable of the day. Today it was buttered asparagus. They also have a soup of the day. Today was chili and I really wasn't in the mood for another salad to go with it.

I got my food within a reasonable amount of time. My bison burger came with the usual lettuce, tomato, etc toppings and was indeed a thick cut. It was very good and very filling. I also enjoyed the asparagus which is one of my favorite vegetable and the melted butter that was poured over it was a nice touch.

This place has their own rest room and if it is too difficult to climb stairs they have an elevator which will take you to the main floor. You can park anywhere both inside or outside the Galleria to come here.

I was very pleased with my visit and am looking forward to returning to try out their other offerings."}
{"text":"I came here a few times on business lunches. This place is beautiful and has a huge patio that I can see be filled up with local patrons at night. Their food is good but not fantastic for the price.

I will have to see how the nightlife here is."}
{"text":"A week ago I had the opportunity to enjoy the Yard pre-opening at one of their sampling parties where they test their menu and service prior to opening day.  Under normal circumstances (i.e. when I'm paying for it), when experiencing a new restaurant for the first time, I would rarely deviate from what I consider my \"go-to's\", on a menu. I'm predictable like that, something I know about myself. But these weren't normal circumstances. 

The food was pretty good and nothing I wouldn't have expected from Culinary Dropout. I had the prime rib dip, and it was alright. No onion soup that day, but the au jus was a decent complement. The thing I really liked was the beer selection. It's refreshing, all the new places that are stocking craft beers, with names you never heard of. The Yard is no different. Now Deschutes and Delirium are starting to pop up all over the place so I wouldn't say they are anything new, but delicious none the less. What they do have is a Lager called Batch 19 Pre-Prohibition. Sounds cool and tastes even better. I had to try it, even at lunch which I never do, but again, this was no ordinary day. 

The size of this place is just massive and I can't wait to see what the next couple months hold. The metal canopy that used to house Ducati's and Kawasaki's has be tastefully re-purposed and can easily fit 300 people on a bad day.  I hear they are going to be hosting concerts and events. I'm sure I'll be at a few. As long as the crowd stay's cool and not to pretentious I'm sure I'll be back a lot. It's got a phenomenal location, in a much needed part of town. I can't wait to go back and see what the nightlife is like!"}
{"text":"For some reason I ended up here twice in one week, with different groups of people. This place is a fantastic place downtown that has cheap eats and drink with a laid back vibe. They have awesome happy hour specials too! The food is bar food with a concentration on \"gourmet\" grilled cheeses and it's pretty good at just that! The first time our fries were pretty cold which was disappointing. But, the service has always been quick and reliable. I would've been happier with a burger from Five Guys though. If you're looking for a chill hangout to grab some beers (because they have over a dozen on tap) go here, if you want good meal there are A LOT of other places in this area that are better. Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go for amazing food and fun games! Ping pong, foosball, corn hole, shuffleboard, and giant jenga. Lots of local beer. We ate at the Culinary Dropout. My friend had the meatloaf( which I've had too) and it's to die for! I had the ramen and it was pretty good. I would have liked just a touch more seasoning but other than that it was delish. We are eager to try the other two restaurants attached to the yard as well."}
{"text":"Was there last Wed 3ish liked the valet parking but when we got to the hostess she said she will text us when table is ready,\"around 20 minutes\" so I grabbed a beer at the bar, took a long time to get their attention. Ordered a martini for my wife and the bartender made it terribly! I played a game of ping- pong...cool! Then didn't get the text our table was ready, (my fault) 5 minutes late on getting to the hostess. She said we now have to wait 20 more minutes for a table. She argued with me for a minute or 2 until wifey got pissed then we left. I would love to have tried the food there but bad service ruined it for us! They have a great patio area though!"}
{"text":"The Yard.  The name rolls smoothly off the tongue and conjures images of kids having fun while running around and playing games.  That's a pretty accurate picture, except these are big kids.  With alcoholic beverages.  Fun!  

Our group was a rather large one and we had a reserved lounge section.  Our reservations were for their \"maximum amount\" of 14 and we were assured that any additional people over and above that amount could have join us and pull up chairs.  Our group probably ended up being around 20 or so.  Unfortunately, there wasn't enough space for our entire group to sit or anywhere to add chairs to our section, but we managed to find a way to make it work between standing and walking over to play some games.  Drinks came as quickly as our one server could bring drinks for our 20 or so (plus the other section or two that she likely had that night).  

I did not get offered a menu at any time throughout the night, but did ask for one at one point and our server was quick to respond.  And throughout the night, I could always be found with a drink in my hand.  And our server managed to keep a dozen or so separate checks for our group.  Overall, I thought our server did a pretty remarkable job given the amount of people she was serving, the lack of help, and having to keep all those separate checks straight!

The reason for our gathering was that three of us were celebrating our birthdays that night.  And The Yard stepped up and provided a free bottle of champagne for us!  That was completely unexpected and totally awesome of them.  

And the food... oh the food.  Pretzel and cheese fondue was just ok... but I also had the joy of indulging in a Turkey Pastrami sandwich.  The sammy definitely hit the spot and left me completely satisfied.  Seriously, the sandwich could not have been any better.

I know a handful of the people in our group were not as happy with the experience as I was, so I knocked off a star for that... as well as the whole parking mess they have.  I didn't even attempt to valet (which I believe is the only option offered) because the line of cars was so long that I couldn't even turn in off of 7th Street.  Fortunately, I was able to find street parking across the street and walk over... but I'm sure the neighbors aren't a fan of the likely herds of drunk people that must walk through their neighborhood after leaving this FOX concept every night."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today... talk about YUMMY!  The food was quick and I will be dreaming of the Kale Salad with Smoked Salmon for the next couple of weeks.  And the service was beyond awesome. Things to note I also had the black mussels and pretzel fondue!! Whoever the chef is ... lets just run away together lol.. I can spend the rest of my life eating this food :)."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awful at night. Our waiter didn't pay attention to anything we asked for. I had to get up and get napkins because he was nowhere to be found. Will NOT go to this place again, especially at night."}
{"text":"The yard has a fun atmosphere with an open concept. It was a bit overwhelming at first, but once you sit down and have time to adjust and look around, there's a lot fun to be had.

We stopped in for a quick bite and a quick beer, so my quick review is exactly that. But it was enough for me to want to come back for dinner and try my hand at the bags court!"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant. We came for lunch and arrived before the work crowd. We had the Mac and cheese balls as an appetizer, they were delicious! My son had the Mac and cheese grilled cheese and I had the Smack Yo Mama grilled cheese, both were great. So much food we could not eat it all!"}
{"text":"Parking, parking, parking.  I don't understand why there is no parking here.  Valet is often full and you can't park on the street because the neighbors got pissed and had signs put up \"no parking here.\"  So if valet is full you'll end up driving around forever trying to find a place to park.  Oh, also, trying to even find the valet parking is a challenge.  You'll probably need to circle around a few times.  I guess if I lived within walking distance of this place, and was a true hipster, and didn't mind crappy service, then this place would be awesome.  Sad, because if they just had a parking lot (a strange neccisity in 2013) and better service then this place could be a lot better."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I am not sure if I will be back for a third. The idea is great, it's nice to have the option to play games and whatnot, but the place is just too busy...maybe they should let less people in? not sure. The valet is a bit of a nightmare, as it gets backed up and you wait for a very long time, at times. I went for happy hour once and it was very hard to get a spot in the bar area (the only area that honors happy hour pricing), but after waiting awhile, we got a spot. All of the food we got consisted of bread and cheese and were fine, but how bad can bread and cheese be? I thought the grilled cheese sliders would have bacon or whatever they do on the regular menu, but not so at happy hour...sigh. I also went to a fellow yelper's birthday party here and it was a bit crazy... not as much seating as they had given us in the reservation, no possible way to get food (not enough room), extremely slow service....took over 25 min to get my credit card back and my husband had to go find the waitress for this to happen...thought maybe they lost the card...yikes. It was just nothing special."}
{"text":"Burger was exceptional and atmosphere was great. Excellent place for any meal or any event."}
{"text":"Went here for birthday dinner.  Service was ok.  I was given a gift of a half gallon of Grey Goose for my birthday that was unfortunately left at our table.  Somehow the half gallon of Grey Goose was nowhere to be found.  Hopefully the dishonest server enjoys his gift.  Don't go here if you want to ever get anything back you forget.  They are thieves."}
{"text":"The Yard is cool! Their sweet tater fries with cinnamon butter are super yums. Their beer selection is just dandy. The only thing questionable is service sometimes. I had a server the other week who almost dropped two things into my lap. Could have been an off night. Regardless, will go back because it's a good Market Square spot!"}
{"text":"I so badly want to love this place ... The concept of having a restaurant and gaming area inclusive, being a supporter of bicycles, and literally RIGHT around the corner from my residence sounds like the perfect neighborhood bar! 

However, I am disappointed in the service every time I go. Watching paint dry is a faster process than ordering a cocktail, and the bartenders seem more interested in each other than the customers. I loved the cocktail named \"Room service\" but I only had time to order one before my bill came at midnight; I showed up at 1030 ... Then, I was charged for 2 drinks on my tab!!! I'm not sure what their hiring standards are, but I've gone to the Yard different times of the day and have been utterly disappointed in the service Every.Single.Time. It really is quite a shame ... If they are going for a hipster version of \"Dicks\" where they treat everyone like crap as part of the experience, then I wish I would at least get a paper-made hat with a clever saying on it!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Pretty People City... Recently paid a visit to The Yard with family members to honor a birthday, and what a celebration! At first it looked a little intimidating with the cars waiting to be parked, I was fourth in line for the valet service. Two minutes later my car was being driven away and I was headed in. The valet service was very professional and quick on their feet and knew what they are doing. I heard parking was a nightmare at The Yard but I must disagree. I arrived on a Friday at 18:00 and two minutes later I was in like Flynn. The hostesses were welcoming and very informative. If you give them your cell phone number they will text notifying you of your table availability. This breaks the invisible chain that ties you to the hostess as you prematurely read her lips as she says \"Joan\" thinking she said \"John\". Only to about face and walk the walk of shame back to your party in embarrassment. The bar has an excellent selection of assorted beer and is very well stocked with spirits and wine. The outdoor patio is vast and wide and offers tables, benches, chairs. Ping pong tables and back yard cornhole.. The service is very competent and are seasoned veterans. The food is outstanding and well rehearsed. We had the following dishes that were all divine: Jamon Iberico, Crusty Bread, Humbolt Fog, Dolce Gorgonzola, Black Mussels, Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue ( I would straight pour that fondue on my cereal) 36 hour Pork Ribs, Fried Chicken and Korean Style Ribeye. Everything was outstanding and I would definitely recommend and will be back. Can't say enough about the staff. They served with such ownership you could have mistaken them for the owners."}
{"text":"Good food overall. We didn't like one of the dishes and they took it off the bill for us. We had brunch and got the chicken and waffles. I would highly recommend those."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite spot in uptown! I was shocked to see the current star rating and would have to disagree, the is a five star establishment. The food is amazing from their pork belly nachos to the Italian chopped salad to the breakfast frittata you can't go wrong. They make great drinks and have an awesome happy hour ($3 mug beers and half priced apps yes please!). The vibe here though tops it all. It's laid back and relax unlike the bar scene in old town and on mill. You can actually have a conversation with the people you are there with and play games like corn hole and ping pong. I also really like the valet situation they have going on, it's nice to just pull up and not worry about finding a parking spot. If you live in this area I promise you will be here more often then not!"}
{"text":"Cami was awesome!! She was very attentive, and supportive!! If you know what I mean!! Food was amazing!! Fried chicken amaze balls!!! But the atmosphere is what I most aim for, and as always... 100% perfect!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Always happy with my order at the Culinary Drop out, and love the vibe at The Yard.  Great service during the week.  Sometimes outside can be hit or miss when busy in the weekends.  We like going to The Drop Out with big groups."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT at Culinary Dropout! The food is disgustingly awful. The whole building is a nice place to sit & drink overpriced drinks. The food was the worst food around. Saturday night bar service was frustratingly slow. All the bar tenders were slow, rude, & did not care about servings the patrons. Will not go back to Culinary dropout. 
 Don't waste your time/money. Go anyplace else."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday with a group of friends!  We sat outside and were able to move around and visit.  The atmosphere is fun and the food and drinks are great.  Brittany was a fantastic server!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoying this new location after two solid visits. First, the wait staff has been amazing, taking very good care of us. And the food - I had the Blarney Stoner grilled cheese - was fantastic! The addition of the tomato soup is a perfect side, and I basically dipped everything on my plate in it. I'll be trying their take on a Cuban sandwich for my next visit. Very respectable beer menu as well, something for everyone. I haven't had the brunch menu items yet, either, but it's certainly a strong offering."}
{"text":"Attended a fundraiser for a local refugee resettlement organization here. It's in the heart of Market Square which attracts professionals and tourists making it very busy and sorta noisy. But it was Friday during happy hour so I'd expect nothing less. For as hectic and busy as it was the staff were on point. Never had to wait or go looking for someone. Very attentive. We had appetizers with a variety of sauces. The spread was good but nothing to write home about. Kinda typical. I'm a grilled cheese fanatic and had every intention of eating a sandwich but stuck with apps. I'll go back for a sandwich soon and update review at that time."}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow even when the restaurant was not busy during lunch. Arrived at noon only to have my order taken at 12:35 for an overpriced grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"The Yard is a pretty great place! All of the experiences I've had there have been great. The first time I went I actually visited the Shadyside location. I had the Mac Attack grilled cheese and it was pretty good! All of the grilled cheese sandwiches come tomato soup on the side and your choice of fries. I chose the sweet potato fries and they were delicious! The sweet potato fries come with a delicious cinnamon butter dipping sauce, it's so yummy! The tomato soup is basically marinara sauce, could've been a little creamier and less dense. 

The second time I went to the Yard was the downtown location. It's a nice location and I've tried to come here before twice but it's crazy busy on the weekends! My friend and I shared the Mac Attack balls as an appetizer and THEY WERE AWESOME! It comes with this great sriracha mayo dipping sauce, which is amazing. For dinner, I had the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia grilled cheese and it was really good actually! They were a little stingy with the steak but the beer cheese and red peppers had a great flavor! For dessert we shared the Cause We Got High dessert and boy was it good! It comes on Texas toast with nutella, peanut butter and bananas on the inside, deep fried and then topped with marshmallows and chocolate sauce. I'm glad I split it because it was huge! 

The servers are really nice and I've always had great service here. The food always seems to come out very fast too! I went this past Monday and had the Mac Attack again and this time is was even better than the first time! 

Come check out this place!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Just as good a time as my first time.  Parking is HORRIBLE but we parked across the street and walked over.   Was there with a small birthday group.  We had an amazing and attentive server, Calvin (and Hobbs). I was at a table with little 20 year old hottie girls and Calvin still managed to make me feel special.  Very good trait in a server. (and one I enjoy immensely!)  I had the Miss Margaret drink which is like champagne and brandy and juices....oh man.  sooooo good. Also had the pretzel and fondue appetizer and the salted caramel custard.  Yes caramel custard and it has caramel popcorn on top.  They should just serve that popcorn as an option.  Really good.  As it got later, more music.  The open kitchen was nice and showed the staff jamming down in there.  I love when staff has fun.  You know then its a good place!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here... The yard is a Sam Fox enterprise consisting of Culinary Dropout and Cleo's...we have been to the Scottsdale location but much prefer the Phoenix one due to atmosphere and attitude of the servers. 
Again we had a very good experience and after eating spent the afternoon playing ping pong at the tables.. No charge, just a drivers license.
The pretzel fondue is yummy and really anything on their menu would probably be good. Sam Fox does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We go to the yard frequently for the fun atmosphere but have lately been disappointed in the food. We always get the pork belly nachos which are always tasty! Last night we decided to try the steak tacos. We were not impressed. It was steak and guacamole on a bland tortilla with some kind of radish topping. 

The steak tacos were served with a side of jicama coleslaw. When we were ordering our food our waitress asked if we wanted to substitute the coleslaw. I've had jicama before and wasn't worried about it so I thought I'd try it. After trying it I have to say it's not coleslaw. It was a very spicy something. I don't know what you could even call it. The flavor was horrible. We should have trusted our waitress.

We still had a fun time playing corn hole and foosball and enjoyed a couple drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome in the fall-spring time, it's fun outside but too hot in the summer.

Corn hole games, jumbo jenga, selfie machine- for group pics, sometimes a live band, cool-cozy seating areas & fire pits, ping pong tables & a couple cool restaurants. Fun place for families or friends."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes - it's overpriced and not notably delicious. The only thing I would order again is the soft pretzel fondue appetizer.  Everything else I tried or that my friends ordered was only mediocre, or less than mediocre. I ordered the shrimp caesar kale salad and was pretty disappointed. The salad itself was fine (although too much dressing) but the shrimp was those tiny popcorn breaded and fried shrimp (96% breading and 4% shrimp)- not what I expected in a salad. I would've much preferred a few normal-sized grilled shrimp, especially if I'm paying $13.  My friends ordered various antipasti, none of which seemed impressive. One of my friends ordered the sweet corn cannelloni which she didn't even finish because it was too sweet and the corn wasn't cooked enough.

The reason I am giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 is because the vibe is really cool. I like the little stage they have for live music and I think the \"yard\" is awesome with all the different games to play. I'd be back to have a drink, order that fondue appetizer, and play games, but NOT for dinner."}
{"text":"Have to give 5 stars on account of there was a lot of noodles in my soup, and I wasn't even going to say anything, and the server came over, gasped, and immediately took it off my bill. NICEST LADY EVER. Drinks were good, nice atmosphere, and overall really just happy about the class act service."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't wrote a review for here yet! I love The Yard! I haven't had Little Cleo's yet but just in general the atmosphere is really great and the food at Culinary Dropout is always superb, plus I love not having to find parking."}
{"text":"We gave our name to be seated and were told it'd be 20-25 minutes and they would send a text when they were ready so we could walk around a bit but we never got a text so we just came back to wait and watched 3 parties come in and were seated right away. So we asked and were told \"Oh. I can seat you now.\" Then we ordered poutine, that was just okay, and grilled cheese. We watched the people who got there at the same time get their food, eat, and get their bill before we even had our food. So we tracked down our waitress and asked how much longer. She immediately went to the kitchen and brought our food? Unfortunately it was cold and pretty mediocre for $14 grilled cheese."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time. I was AMAZING we went to Barrios for the Mexican food and it didn't disappoint. I will be going back to try the other two restaurants at the yard. We had the brisket burrito and the enchiladas suezas. Such a unique Latin taste. Thumbs u!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. First, the entire table got their drinks...except my husband. They couldn't even remember what he ordered. Then food comes out...except my husbands. Once again they had to ask what he ordered. When his food came out 10 minutes later the server had the audacity to stand at the end of the table and ask who ordered the prime rib sandwich. Seriously?  Only one person at the table didn't have food.  Drink refills were also non-existent. If I ever wanted to go here again I can totally forget it. After service like that my husband will never return again."}
{"text":"Great food great service! We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and it was amazing. We all got different lunches. They had a great beer selection, Bloody Mary bar, and bottomless mimosas!! Staff was very friendly and it was a great low key setting. Could definitely see coming here for a football game."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the Steelers game (they were away this weekend). The hostess was very pleasant. We ordered the gravy fries with cheese curds as an appetizer. It was great. I sampled a couple IPAs while my girl friend had a berry flavored beer from a local microbrewery. She ordered French toast for brunch while I went with the house burger with garlic Parmesan fries. She said the French toast was very good.  My burger was cooked right and was good. The fries were a let down as they seem to use powdered cheese. Our waitress seemed like she had better things to do because about 20 seconds after we sat down she asked what we wanted to order. I hadn't even had time to open the beer list (they have 39 taps). We asked for more time and she seemed annoyed by it. I would go back for the food and he beer but if was sat in her section again I would just go sit at the bar instead."}
{"text":"The Market Square Location was a blast - maybe it was because it was a  Steeler Sunday Brunch and the place was packed with 'yinzers'. Possibly could've been the drink specials and great veggie burger, but i can't quite pinpoint it. Although there are a ton of good places to go in Market Square, I'd certainly recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Amazing service and equally amazing food! I ordered the Frank the Tank- the best buffalo chicken dip I have ever tasted in between a warm grilled cheese! Our waitress was amazing and attentive and refilled my coke literally every 5 minutes. I'm so happy that the Yard is now at the Galleria! The atmosphere is great (there's always some type of sports game on) albeit a little noisy. Nonetheless, I love the Yard and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Games look pretty fun but there's always a group playing or waiting to play so patience is key. Food ranges from good to great. Not a fan of the drink prices but perhaps that's being nit picky (or cheap!). Try visiting when it's cooler outside while wearing a jacket so you can minimize crowds."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of gourmet grilled cheeses. Tons of TVs to watch the game and prompt friendly service. You won't find a better spot for lunch in Pittsburgh. There is a large full service bar or you can sit at a table."}
{"text":"First time here and will be returning. Very friendly environment with accommodating staff. It was 4 adults and 2 toddlers, we had a blast, staff even payed attention to the kids. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent dinner, good bar food, and a variety of drink options, this place is a good find.
The variety of their seating is nice, and the place is pretty versatile. I love that you can at outside if you would like to.
They have happy hour which is nice, and everyone is always trying to accommodate. If you are up for some outdoor ping pong or corn hole, this place is the place to go!! 
The last time I went I had a salad with sweet potato chips/crumbs in it and it was soo good.."}
{"text":"Amazing local beer, local food, and local people bringing much love to the atmosphere. B"}
{"text":"I thought The Yard was really cool! It has a unique atmosphere, and is open to air. I came for happy hour on a Thursday, all 12oz draughts are $3. Well also had the pretzel bites with cheese fondue. Easily enough for two to share. Lots of delicious, delicious carbs. We met some people while playing cornhole. Everyone seemed to be having fun."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix with friends and thought it looked interesting when driving by. Saturday night was busy, but the atmosphere was energetic, service was GREAT, and watching the cooks in the open kitchen was entertaining. We had 4 different dishes among the 4 of us and all were very good. We enjoyed it so much, we went back on Sunday night. Service again was superb. I have not been in a restaurant before where EVERYONE working there seemed to be really enjoying their job and taking care of their customers."}
{"text":"Decent lunch, if slightly over priced per plate at the quality level I saw on my first visit. Nothing really jumps out on the menu, it's like a nice Applebee's I guess. I did the caprese with chicken for I think $16. The staff seems really friendly however and they have free, easy to access Wi-Fi available which is a plus at lunchtime. 

My only issue was with the blaring music coming from the PA system. Even through my headphones on at full volume I could hear what I only assume was Mumford and his kids screaming, warbling and carrying on over my podcast. Not what I'd call lunchtime volume.

When the song ended I heard the gentleman next to me sigh audibly to which I said \"big difference huh?\" \"It's like the cabin pressure dropped in here,\" he replied. Before I could agree the sonic assault resumed. I gestured for the check a bit quicker than planned as a result."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, what a great hang-out spot in central Phoenix. We were there on a Thursday evening and the ambience is yuppie cool. Lovely lights strung throughout a place that feels like someone's huge backyard. Good food provided by three local establishments that we adore. The service was excellent and friendly. Loved playing Ping-Pong and bean bag toss. We'll be back to hang out for some more of your extraordinary tasting cocktails and good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here at 9pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was still full so we had to wait till the hostess cleared off a table.  We loved our food but we were not impressed with our waiter.  He was rushing us through the whole meal and was not very friendly.  We are looking forward to coming back and hopefully getting a different server."}
{"text":"So delicious, I ordered the hale to Caesar sandwich and it was amazing. The whole menu is unique and tasty.  I love that all the sandwiches are served with chips and soup, it makes the perfect meal.  Although I'd love to see the restaurant cleaned better. The bathrooms were pretty bad and the whole place had an odd smell to it. I love coming here but after seeing how bad the bathrooms were I know that it will be hard for me to eat here again without wondering what the kitchen conditions are like."}
{"text":"I have been to the new yard location twice so far, once for brunch and once for dinner. Both times I have had a really great experience and our waiters were awesome. The waiters were kind, talkative, and attentive, even on a super busy night. As for the food, I ordered the snozberry pancakes and they were delicious! They were huge and I even took some home to share. The waiter gave me two different syrups to try, one was plain and one was maple bacon (yum). As for dinner, I ordered the buffalo mac and cheese sandwich and it was also amazing. They have a great drink selection to choose from as well. I ordered a raspberry cider and will definitely be going back for more :) 
I can say that on a weekend, use the open table app to make a reservation since it gets busy, or you will be waiting a very long time."}
{"text":"On the whole, I really enjoyed this place. The food was really good. The service was good...aside from our table being transferred to 3 different servers during our visit...but all 3 servers were good. My only true complaint is the fact that they allow children in the \"Yard\" area. This is the area to have a couple drinks & play a game of bags with friends...Not for your children to run around being obnoxious to adults looking to relax SANS KIDS!! Children in bars make me uncomfortable. PERIOD. It's not fair the majority of patrons have to suffer because a few refuse to get a babysitter or dine at a \"rugrat friendly\" establishment."}
{"text":"Friend and I went last nite (Friday) to try The Yard.  Parking is a nightmare.  At 5:30 the wait time was 70 min. Web site says no reservations but there were a lot of tables vacant with reserved signs.  Strange. Very loud, lots of kids.  Asked the unfriendly bartender for 2 glasses of Chardnay and when he said that will be $26.00 I almost past out.  I said you are kidding, 2 6?  He said, yes, $26.  At that point we told him forget it and left."}
{"text":"I haven't been there on a weekend night yet.  I haven't heard too many good things from friends when it's crowded.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside because the weather was amazing!!! Everything was really pleasant.  I got their spin on the margarita....ok I had 3. I obviously loved it.  My friend and I got the pretzel appetizer.  Pretzels were super soft and chewy. Mmmmmm.  Husband showed up and got ahi salad and seemed to enjoy it judging by the licked clean plate. 
I will be back!! Hopefully have enough peeps to play some games!"}
{"text":"I had the GP flavored wings , they were good. The vibe from my Co workers was lukewarm , we just flew into town,  hungry , and this place was recommended.  Not saying it was bad,  it was OK . Sometimes ok is good , we return in month ; let's try The Yard again."}
{"text":"Visited today with 6 friends. I got the Frank the Tank, which is a buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken was very high quality and tender.  The tomato soup was delicious, and I'm not even a tomato lover.  The service was awesome, and I didn't even have to ask for refills of Diet Coke.  They just kept them coming.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the Market Square area."}
{"text":"From what i can tell, The Yard is the part complex under the VERY large shade structure once housing a motorcycle sales floor. It has upscale seating area with a garden party feel next to a playground area with corn hole, ping pong, shuffle board and a foosball table. It will be a great place to share a few drinks with friends or make a destination for a day's bike ride.

It looks to be eventually the shared open space for a collection of Sam Fox restaurants. Currently, there is only Culinary Dropout. But, we were told an oyster bar was coming soon. 

It also has a unique restroom layout that may throw you when you first enter.

It is a welcome addition to uptown Phoenix."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our food very much. Grilled cheese everything, hello, that's a winner. Mac n cheese sandwich was crazy good. Mother of dragons was so good you might wish Jon Snow was at the table with you, he's a Stark you know."}
{"text":"This place has a cool concept - but they definitely could've used a lot of the wasted space on tables rather than ping pong tables, bike riding paths and just casual hang out couches.  Our wait was over 1 hour and 20 minutes.  The eating space is about a quarter of the size of the actual \"Yard\" space.  I had the meatloaf - it was pretty tasty, but my friend who ordered the same thing - hers was extremely dry.  Our other friend, ordered the fried chicken which he devoured and said he thoroughly enjoyed.  The live band that played inside the restaurant belonged outside in the yard area.  It was WAY too loud and to even talk to my friend next to me, I had to yell or go right up to her ear and talk.  That's annoying.  Our server was friendly and refilled our drinks regularly.  Overall, I probably wouldn't come back just because the food wasn't worth an hour wait.  But it seems like a really cool hang out place if you want to play in the \"yard\""}
{"text":"It is such a weird place. First off parking is awful and it is confusing even knowing how to get in this place. Valet. I was second in line and went on an off hour so that was fine. The place is an old motorcycle shop so it is a warehouse with these cool, urban chandeliers hanging off the pipe rafters. It is really as strange as it sounds but kinda cool! They have this big patio back yard. I did not sit out there it looked so pretty. They had a singer out there who was good. 

The staff is very young and super attractive, hip. The patrons are all types. I had good service. I was treated very nice by all. I wasn't feeling well when I visited and needed time to kill before a gig. The waitress did not mind me sitting, reading, and being, all in all, pretty slow. I ordered the pretzels of course, because that is the talked about food here. Even for non cheese lover me, Ummmmmm, Hello? They were great but 10 dollars is way too much. Ouch! The homemade chips looked really good for a return trip. I did not eat any of the other food. I have heard poor things about the food here beyond the apps so I will have to come back and give it a try myself. 

A note on the server. She was great and very nice. However, she should not wait for a costumer to ask to refill drinks. I had to ask for drink refills. Still the service was much better than the other Yelpers have written about. The food came very fast too but again I just ordered the app. 

I liked it and would go back at least one more time to see what I think. I am not sure they will last though since they are way overpriced. 

PS- the bathrooms are interesting and my friend swears by their Bacon Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Cool spot hidden downtown that definitely seemed to cater to a younger crowd. The food was good, service was great, and food was served quick. They have a great selection of sandwiches and grilled cheese's and a solid beer selection. While it fashions itself a place for watching sports, their tv placement could use some work. If you were seated in the crowded dining area, you had some difficulty glimpsing the games and could not hear what was happening over the murmur of the frat-tastic crowd."}
{"text":"Been here once before. The tapas kind of thing is cool, but definitely ask questions because some things are just weird. Like seven bucks for cheddar covered pork - which is just a fancy name for pork rinds! Their pretzels balls with cheese fondue is good. Don't order from the tapas \"antipasti\" menu. Order your entrees. Drinks are delicious. I personally recommend Papago brewed Orange Blossom as a refreshing drink for that hot Arizona heat."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese sandwiches are one of my favorite foods so I was very excited to try this place and I wasn't disappointed! I ordered \"The Jerk\" with the standard side of homemade chips and tomato soup. Let me tell you the apple chutney that came on the sandwich I could eat all day everyday! Our server was awesome as well - was able to suggest beers which would be to our taste and kept the pace of the meal perfect. 
Overall I will definitely not hesitate to visit again."}
{"text":"I've been to The Yard three times now and I was a little surprised by the low Yelp rating when I looked it up. While I've had a good experience each time I've come, I can understand how it could really go either way on any given night. 

Yes ,it's busy and the valet parking is everywhere in this area, but we've always gotten taken care of immediately. Check in has always been great and the texting when your table is ready is soooo much better than those vibrating disks. I'm a huge ping pong player and while other's have had a bad experience getting paddles, we've always lucked out. The first time we lucked into getting paddles by walking up to the first table and they were done. The last time, it was slow enough on a Friday night (which was a bit weird given my past two experiences where it was really crowed) that we didn't have anyone else playing and we were able to get them right away from the hostess. We have never scored the bags but at the same time, I'd much rather play ping pong so that is okay with me. 

The food is pretty good and while I do think the pretzel bites are good, they aren't the best ever. Good but not something I would crave. I've gotten a few different things and I do like the chicken salad, though last time, it did seem a bit off. Other people in my parties have ordered the meatloaf and the chicken and seemed to like it.

Our servers have always been prompt but I can't recall any of them being overly friendly and service does seem slow. I don't think it helps that this place is HUGE. They probably get in several miles of walking every night. I do remember one time that they couldn't make our group some speciality shot a friend requested. Can't remember what exactly what it was but I did think it was weird. It seems more of a speciality bar that only stocks certain things. Last trip we ordered the Kona beer and it was served in a can. While I'm all for keeping up with the atmosphere and playing into the 'yard' theme, canned beer isn't really my thing. Can't recall if she offered us cold glasses or not. 

What I do love about this place is that it can be a whole evening. Entertainment, pretty good food and really good people watching.  Last visit, there was a good band right out in the center and I enjoyed listening to them. Too often you go out to dinner and then don't have much to do afterwards so its nice having an option for one stop shopping on date night. Overall, I like this place and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. Food is good. Prices are reasonable. I only dock 1 star because of the \"mandatory\" valet parking. I was lucky enough I found a spot on the street."}
