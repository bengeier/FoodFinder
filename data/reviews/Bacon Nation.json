{"text":"I love this place! It is way to convenient to get to from my work, I feel like I need an adult. In all seriousness though, the food is fantastic! I've had all positive experiences eating here, and it's quite addicting. If you are a fan of the PIG, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bacon Nation's food pavillion at CNE to try out the well-anticipated bacon wrapped grilled cheese. CNE being infamous for its heart clogging eats, I actually found it to be reasonable. Don't get me wrong, every bit of it was dripping in grease, but somehow I didn't feel utterly disgusting by the end of it. At 13 dollars it's a bit pricey, but I probably wouldn't mind visiting the store location at some point to try their other items."}
{"text":"If you're a bacon lover, this is the place to go! Had the Notorious P. I. G....Awesomeness! !!!!"}
{"text":"Have had a burger before, and tried the Bacon Wrapped Grilled Cheese this past weekend, nothing special and considering the prices, they should be."}
{"text":"I was at Union Station looking for something quick and delicious. I love bacon and I love Club Sandwiches so I thought I'd give it a try. 

The first red flag was when I saw the cook pull the bread out of a Dempsters bag but I stayed open minded. Didn't help. Bread is a pretty big part of a sandwich and if I wanted a lousy one with cheap Dempsters bread, I can make one at home.

The bacon was tough and the fries were decent. But if I'm paying more than Subway prices ($15!) for a sandwich, I'm expecting  higher than Subway quality. This was a disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I were walking down spadina when we came across Bacon Nation.  We tried it before at the CNE and we weren't that impressed but decided to give it another try.  We ordered the apple porkfection sandwich...it was average.  The sandwich was lukewarm, the coleslaw could have been sweeter, the bbq sauce could have been more flavourful but I did enjoy the strips of bacon which gave it a nice crispy texture.  All in all, it was decent but there are too many better options in that area to return."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant at 170 Spadina with the Groupon promotion. I had previously come to the restaurant two weeks prior during the CNE to find out the restaurant had temporarily closed. There was no notice of this closure on the website, with only a note posted on their front doors. This example of bad communication from the restaurant was seen again on my second visit.

On the second attempt after the kitchen renovations were completed, I phoned in at 10 am to confirm the restaurant's hours as the website and Facebook page posted conflicting business hours.The hostess confirmed that the restaurant would be open however when I asked for clarification for the opening time, a response of \"I don't know, maybe in 2 minutes or 30 minutes\" was given. How can the staff not know when the restaurant is scheduled to open?

Fortunately, the restaurant was open upon arrival. I ordered the breakfast platter included in the Groupon deal which included a juice or coffee. They had ran out orange juice which was unexpected for a brunch restaurant.

The breakfast platter consisting of maple bacon, peameal bacon, fries, eggs and toast was actually quite nice.The portions were fair for a good value. Service was prompt and friendly. 

The place is worth a try for a unique dining experience if you love bacon. The rating has been adjusted accordingly to account for the prior miscommunication on the restaurant's part . For all the troubles experienced, I would not return."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever, the pork Mac.... too good to describe, that's what I call a real burger. Great friendly staff, great place to spend time with friends."}
{"text":"Ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich for delivery. The chicken was unevenly cooked, and the breading came off immediately and turned to mush. The bacon was also undercooked. Just don't...."}
{"text":"Ordered from just eat for delivery....was like 33 dollars...I had 42 I wanted a 5 back...delivery guy didn't have change because i was first customer...pretty unprofessional if you ask me. Shouldn't you carry change as a delivery person?....i reluctantly gave him a 7 dollar tip and told \"this food better be good.\" 

I open up the containers. My heart sank. Burger was drenched like someone threw it in a swimming pool. It tasted like someone made it days before. The lettuce in it was dark and gooey...seemed rotten. Fries were in a packed oil ball (definitely leftovers ). ..tasted like cardboard with oil. No salt or flavor. The only ok thing to eat was the sunny side up eggs...again not salted and the onion rings. 

Btw I'm the least pickiest person ever. I'll eat anything. I never write reviews but after this food atrocity and tipping 7 bucks I had to say something. Because I feel pretty gipped. I can't believe they would actually look at the food they sent me and thought \"yup that's good enough!\"....Im praying I don't get sick. ..ugh"}
{"text":"Well I liked this place so much I chose it for my last meal in Canada! First impression.. Hipster cool and fun. Staff... are uber friendly and helpful. Food.. Food was great! Plates could have been warmer to retain the heat of the food! Ordered a cup of tea it was not very warm. I recommend the pig!"}
{"text":"Bacon is a daily need for me and when I heard about this place, I HAD to go.  We didn't know what to order and the staff was very helpful.  Their recommendations were on point with how hungry we were feeling.  We ordered the Canadian Bacon Tacos and the Pig Mac...it was like having the most amazing bacon filled party in my mouth ever!  So delicious!  The fries needed some work but if you're there for the bacon, who cares about the fries.  If you love bacon, you MUST go!"}
{"text":"Service is brutal, waitress was rude, took 15 minutes from order to get coffee. Served French fries with breakfast(not homefries). Overall will never go back"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! I bought a groupon for a 2 for 1 meal. So we got 2 just so we can try out the different options. 

We had so much fun! They have board games you can play while you eat/ wait for the food. We were playing battle ship so it make the wait time fly by. I will definitely come back and will be bringing more friends.

What your here for...THE FOOD!!!
 I ordered: 
APPLE PORKFECTION: (BBQ pulled pork topped w/ bacon strips & our signature apple slaw on a brioche bun, served with fries) ($9.75) Dear God this was amazing!! The best pulled pork I have ever had. So juicy and flavorful!! This is a must try!!!

THE PIG MAC: (Hand crafted beef burger topped w/ bacon strips cheese, lettuce, tomato & bbq sauce on a bacon studded bun. Served w/ fries) ($9.95) I went simple for this but I have to admit they make a mean burger, definitely 5/5 on the burger scale.

My Fiance:
THE NOTORIOUS P.I.G.: (Only for true bacon lovers. Hand crafted beef burger topped w/ bacon strips, peameal bacon &pulled pork, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, onion straws & bbq sauce. On a bacon brioche bun. Served w/ fries) ($14.95) He loves Bacon so this was a must try for him and he loved it. I thought it would be to much bacon, he says its all good. If you could he would have ordered a second one.

THE WAKE & BACON BURGER: (Hand crafted beef burger topped w/ bacon strips, sunny side up egg, cheddar cheese & bbq sauce on a bacon brioche bun. Served w/ home fries & mixed greens) ($12.95) He likes his eggs sunny side up so I couldn't watch him eat this.... The aftermath was he loved it and not he puts eggs on his burger when we make them at home.


Over all Great food, great people and fun atmosphere. Highly recommended for all groups."}
{"text":"Ended up here because of a group deal... and we loved breakfast, so why not?
Once you go inside and read the menu, you'll realize why the place is called like that.

Ordered the PIG breakfast... it was not bad, but it looks like they cooked everything on the same grill, without cleaning it constantly, because the eggs, bacon, and even the pancakes had pieces of burnt grease stuck on them... as I said, food was not bad, but that burnt grease gives an odd flavour to your food, so my suggestion is that every once in a while, you guys scrape off the grill.

Also, what they called a bottomless cup of coffee it's relative, because we got one cup when we arrived, then we were never offered refills, and even when I went closer to the kitchen with the cups on my hands (because I noticed the personnel were really busy) to get more coffee, I was asked by the server to go back to my seat, and that she was going to go and serve us more coffee... after 10 minutes (by clock... not lying), we just paid and left."}
{"text":"Went to the new Kensington location.
Bacon was fatty and under cooked. Grilled cheese sandwich was cold in the middle.
So many better choices in Kensington"}
{"text":"From the outside and based in the menu it would be easy to assume this place is a run of the mill diner and that would be wrong. While the menu are diner options the flavour and tweaks are great, as is the service."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was good because I went there shortly after it opened on a non-busy day. Nowadays it seems like a pretty mediocre burger place, to be honest. The food quality declined since it opened. I feel like people only come here because it's called \"bacon nation.\""}
{"text":"Note: this rating is for the food truck. 

I went to SEW Hungry 2015 and out of all the food trucks, I chose this. Let me tell you, what a disappointment. I got the bacon cheddar fries which were advertised as: fresh cut fries smothered in cheese sauce and bacon bits/strips. The fries did not taste (or even look) fresh cut, they were cold, and the cheese sauce was bland. The only thing they did right was the bacon (unsurprisingly). Not sure if they weren't expecting such a large turn out and therefore unprepared, but the food was not worth the $10 I forked over. The eatery might be different (or even the other items on the menu), but this time around, a fail. Sorry Bacon Nation, next time the food trucks roll into town, I'll wait in line somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service where the guy at the cash was ready with recommendations when I asked for them and described each recommendation in great detail. I decided to order the Drunken Stupor which was a breakfast sandwich which had bacon strips, whisky bbq sauce and a fried egg on a kaiser. I ordered this while anticipating a heartburn but to my surprise this bacon sandwich actually tasted really light! I didn't find that it was bogged down by grease and salt and was actually able to enjoy the layers of flavours in the sandwich. I wasn't too thirsty after eating the sandwich too which is always a good sign. Super excited to return and try the rest of the menu but I think I still need some courage to face that all bacon patty.

Also during my visit, I noticed that a few items actually came down in price which is always good news for students like myself in the area!"}
{"text":"Bring Cash, they don't take debit or credit cards!  Would have been nice to know before the meal!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm bacon. This place has a great concept, but I don't think they pulled it off well enough. 

Pros:
-friendly service
-apple porkfection sandwich was pretty tasty. Good combination of ingredients

Cons:
-I ordered the notorious p.i.g. ($15) Now I'm a pretty big meat lover/ bacon lover, but this burger was just a bit too much. It was essentially filled with bacon tasting meat. I would've liked a bit more contrast in flavors. They did have a layer of vegetables inside, but I think it was pretty pointless, as it was just a really thin layer relative to the mass of meat. I think this burger wouldve worked better with grilled onions or something else in addition. That being said, it was massive. 
-There's a nutella sandwich too (nutella, banana and bacon on raisin bread). Again, this sounded very good in concept, but just didn't taste very good together. Maybe it was the proportions of each ingredient. The banana and nutella seemed to dominate the taste
-Food took a LONG time to get out (and it wasn't busy when we went)
-A little on the pricey side. PIG was $15. Fries dishes are about $6+ (although you can add regular fries to your meal for about $2.5

I don't think that I'll return

Takes credit card"}
{"text":"Server forgot our orange juice. Requested egg whites but chef claimed egg white was not possible. Orange juice was also included in check so we had to remind server of that. The bacon pancakes were very good. Substituted for turkey bacon. But because it was cooked in pork grease, we left feeling sick. Never returning here."}
{"text":"Bacon nation it's about time!! Everything is delicious... Ridiculous actually. The menu is so much fun I always wonder how they even come up with these things!! We had the food truck come to a friends private house party and it was fantastic, they were fast, friendly, and the food was drool worthy. I would recommend them for anyone that is looking for a food truck at a private event!!!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and the waitress was a newb.   Eating outside was ok.   And the neighbour flavour was nice."}
{"text":"As you can guess from the name, everything is focused on bacon! I ordered the breakfast platter which was a good sized portion.  There are some interesting combos of bacon with other ingredients but my friends and I found the bacon to be a bit soggy instead of crispy the way most people like it.  I might consider eating here again if someone else wants to try it but unless you're crazy for not-so-healthy greasy food, then it's likely somewhere you'll only visit once or twice."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pig Mac and fries through Uber EATS app. It was one of the best burgers I've had and I'm a big burger fan. I'll definitely be eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"Went to their CNE location for the bacon wrapped grilled cheese. I think I've got the wrong order as the whole thing doesn't taste  like a bacon. It felt like chewing on a piece of greasy bread. So j just kinda let it go and went to try the Pig Mac. I don't know how these people can get away calling their restaurant Bacon Nation as the sandwich k got only got a small piece of bacon and the burgers from Walmart are better. 

If you want to know how you can screw up a bacon. Try their location. I didn't know bacon can taste like that"}
{"text":"When you add bacon to just about anything it becomes improved.  

Bacon wrapped dog with bacon and bacon bits here.  the truck is usually in the alleyway too."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place was soooooo good!  It had a nice outside area, wait staff was excellent and attentive.  The Bloody Mary was pretty good; I would put it in my top 20.  We tried several items while here... bacon beer flight, maple bacon and a few other things.  It's definitely a spot I would go back to."}
{"text":"The vibe of the restaurant is relaxed and enjoyable, mostly because the hostess/waitress is so lovely and welcoming. However, we waited a looooong time for our simple bacon poutine order and bacon sandwich. Probably over 20 minutes for a very simple thing. In the end, I am not sure that it is worth the hype."}
{"text":"I was going by Dundas Square when Ribfest was happening... The lines were insane but I couldn't help but feel an unrelenting craving for pulled pork. The problem of not wanting to wait in line, turned into the realization that I (a bacon fetishizing individual), had never come to Bacon Nation. So I walked a few blocks and jumped onto the Queen Streetcar and made my way to Spadina, in efforts of crossing this place off my restaurant bucket list.

The place seems a bit confusing at first as it looks like a takeout burger joint, but in this case they do actually have servers who will give you menus and come take your order from a table. The menu is one side of all day breakfast, and one of mostly sandwiches and burgers and poutine.

I went with the Apple Porkfection Sandwich, which is a brioche bun filled with saucy pulled pork and a couple of bacon strips slapped within it all. And straight up, it was delicious. Not the biggest sandwich, and some may argue that the sauce was a little excessively juicy (the bottom of the bun is a saturated mess by the end of the meal), but I've never been one afraid of getting his hands dirty based on a saucy sandwich. The flavours were on point and the side of fries it came with was a perfectly satisfying lunch for $9.75 + tax.

Only real complaints are that they don't sell booze here, and that I remember reading about tacos made with bacon shells, but they apparently aren't available anymore. But those 2 things aside, I'm definitely a fan. 
Next time, I'm going to have to take a run at the Notorious P.I.G., which sounds like a gluttonously great meal, just more than I was willing to take on during this visit."}
{"text":"Went in today after trying their food truck at the CNE last year. Their bacon banana nutella sandwich and bacon tacos are bomb! Surprisingly it wasn't even greasy while having a generous amount of bacon. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"For all you bacon lovers out there like me, this place is awesome. Great service and wonderful staff. The Bacon Caesar was pretty good and even the cold bacon piece inside was delicious. My favourite dish was the Bacon Taco. Simply mouthwatering and delicious. It was a taco that was wrapped with a nice succulent piece of Peameal bacon. We had an assortment of BLT sandwiches ranging from Jamaican Jerk and Honey with Jack Daniels syrup. Loved the sandwiches as they were delicious. To finish things off, the Bacon Milkshake topped with bacon bites was AMAZING!!!! Highly recommended. Will definitely return for another visit!!! :D"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and friend and shared the Classic Sandwich. I felt kind of bad just ordering one item for the three of us and thought the server was going to be annoyed. We were eating our way around the area since it was my first time in Toronto. The waiter was very understanding. I moved my food over to the counter to the counter to get a picture with the sign and the waiter even moved the plastic pig over for me to include in my photo.

The brioche had a slight crunch and sweetness to it. The Canadian bacon was just cooked to perfection. I am not a big bacon fan but Canadian bacons are just amazing. The fried egg was just the perfect compliment to the burger with the runny yolk."}
{"text":"Dropped in with friends over the weekend while waiting for a wedding reception to start. We were pretty famished but didn't want to eat too much. I ordered the porktine to share. This was probably the best pulled pork poutine I've had. To be honest, I didn't expect much since we went here on a whim, but the pork was moist and very tasty! The others ordered the classic and a bacon grilled cheese. I can't really attest to those but everyone was happy with their meals. Only one guy was running tables so kudos to him for not making us wait too long and providing water refills in a timely manner. 

There are also games on a ledge behind where the bathrooms are located so we played cards against humanity while waiting for our food. All day breakfast is also served so I would definitely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Two words: breakfast poutine. Just when I thought regular poutine was great, that was before I tried this one. I came to Bacon Nation after looking for some different type of poutine at Kensington Market and saw that they had something called the Breakfast Poutine, which instead of gravy is hollandaise sauce and they also add an egg on top. This is by far the best poutine I tried. I actually went back twice today because it was just that good. I'm actually more of a fan of the hollandaise sauce than the actual gravy now. The staff were really friendly and got my order in just a few minutes. My only complaint out of all of this was the price. It's pretty steep. It was around 13 dollars with tax and it's a bit much, I really wish it was at a reasonable price so I could get it more often."}
{"text":"I came to this place with great expectations for the breakfast but I got deeply disappointed. It's got a high price for this type of food if you compare with others great options throughout the city. Food absolutely nothing special, specially for a placed called \"Bacon Nation\". Furthermore and most important of all: the amount of food is really, really revolting. Indeed, the amount of food (at least relative to the breakfast I ordered) comes to be laughable. Maybe other dishes? That wasn't what I could see in other tables on that day."}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers,

I would like to tell you about my experience about this joint.

My friends and I ordered off Foodora. We placed an order for 3 items, waited over an hour for the order to arrive only to be short an item (2 out of 3) and the food was cold A F.

Of course I spoke to both Foodora and the folks at Bacon Nation. The gentlemen I spoke with at Bacon Nation about the mishap responded with a \"Oh F*ck\" and threw Foodora under the bus. Pretty much didn't take any responsibility and was \"too busy\" to do anything about it. 

Anyways, let's avoid this place since it blows. The food is aight and service sucks.

Have a good day y'all and keep on yelping.

{"text":"Came here one night and it was pretty empty. But I like the decor and the service was excellent. Had the pig mac and the bacon peanut butter shake. Friend had the notorious p.i.g. And bacon sticks. Everything was flavourful. Its worth a try."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto for two weeks and while I was in Kensington Market, I dropped by Bacon Nation and I have to say, I really liked it. I wish I would have been there at a less busy time. It took a little longer for us to get our food and I could tell not all the fries were very fresh. Aside from that, I would highly recommend this place because you will get to experience some good poutine. I had the breakfast poutine and I really liked it. I wish I had time to return to try a different, more popular dish."}
{"text":"$5 for small hot dog with one slice of bacon ironically named \"Bacon Wrapped\" I've had better street meat for less. Very disappointing and was expecting much more."}
{"text":"Really underwhelming, especially the poutine, but certainly a filling start to the day, with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Was literally the only person in there who was dining... not a good sign. Despite how slow it was, felt like the server was always MIA. After about 20 mins of waiting on the food, server comes out and explains how the kitchen staff made the meal but didn't have all the ingredients. Said something about how gross the food looked at she wouldn't eat it herself... Suggests something else off the menu so I get that. Food itself was actually pretty decent. Just disenchanted by the poor service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Greetings!! Stopped by for a adult beverage and we enjoyed our drinks. And the best bacon I've had since visiting the area. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. Definitely would return and do the whole experience over again!!!!!"}
{"text":"You call this bacon?
How can you fail so miserably at cooking over easy eggs?

Disgusting bathrooms. 

One star, because yelp won't let you put none."}
{"text":"I really really needed bacon on a cheese burger today, so thank God bacon nation exists. We first went to the burgernator because it has higher reviews but it was dirty, and filled with young hipsters which is basically the foodie equivalent of a grey dark cloud. But the deal breaker was that they didn't have pig bacon. I need my pig bacon man. But for real it's all good if they don't do pork products for religious reasons. So anyways we went to bacon nation.  They served their food on a nice platter versus on the ubiquitous baskets you see elsewhere. The brioche  buns were puuuurfect. And the bacon was exactly what I needed."}
{"text":"This is a review for their truck, which should probably have a separate venue, but ... /shrug emoji.

So I've had two experiences with Bacon Nation. One was during the Ex, in 2015, and it was very awesome to have a bacon wrapped grilled cheese there. So I was already a fan when we happened to run across their truck, parked at Nathan Phillips Square on Canada Day.

We both wanted different things, so we ended up ordering both. I got the bacon poutine, and Lee went for the bacon grilled cheese, different from our Ex grilled cheese, because this one only had bacon in it, not wrapped in it.

Anyway, it was all pretty tasty -- the bacon grilled cheese was nicely tasty, hot and delicious, with lots of bacon. The poutine was 90% delicious, including a lot of bacon all over it, but something on it was a little cold, and I was hoping for a little hotter and gooey-er. Still, both items were devoured with alacrity, and the truck staff were really friendly and happily dispensing bacony goodness.

One of these days, I'll actually go into their brick and mortar location, but so far all my experiences have been mostly positive."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name!  I visited this place while shopping in Kensington Market.  We walked in and no one was inside, so I was a little worried.  Nonetheless, our waiter was super friendly and took our order immediately.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and the bacon was massive!  Our drinks were great and strong.  This is definitely on my list for future visits!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for not only the best bacon dishes in the city but the best fried chicken and waffles, phillycheesteak, Mac and cheese then this is your place. I tried the fried chicken and waffles which had this amazing cole slaw and delicious Mac and cheese on it and was unbelievable! Something different and unique. It's part of the @theheartbreakchef menu. Soooo good! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"visited shortly after the lunch rush.  place was not very busy but service was incredibly slow and rather indifferent. asked if the fries were fresh cut.  waiter said yes.  They were not.  Later he insisted they usually are but they ran out.  I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Mediocre, tons of processed cheese and bacon this truck, fries tasted like soft noodles, overal a really big waste of time and money, avoid if you can."}
{"text":"FOOD & DRINKS
I had the Pig Mac. It is a greasy burger but tasty. For the price I probably wouldn't come back to get another one. The bacon on top was yummy as well but it wasn't crispy on my burger.

SERVICE
Simply OK.

ATMOSPHERE
The interior looks like a mix between fast food chain restaurant and a diner. Pretty dark as well.

RATING
Food is OK/good but for the price I probably try out other restaurants first before I come back here for more bacon."}
{"text":"Breakfast poutine? What a uniquely Canadian, novel concept! My friend and I stumbled into this joint, located smack dab in the middle of Kensington Market, and ordered the breakfast poutine to split. I had wanted to try poutine my entire trip to Toronto, and I figured 9am was as good a time as any for a hearty meal.

The portion of poutine didn't seem massive (one sunny side side up egg over mounds of home fries, smothered in cheese, with bacon that I specially asked for to be on the side), but finishing it was an endeavor that the two of us couldn't complete. The poutine was delicious but just so, so heavy. However, despite its branding as a breakfast item, I'd go back and have it for lunch or dinner. 

My only qualms from the meal:
- The restaurant didn't serve any iced coffee or tea...only hot 
- The kitchen had run out of the cheese curds that normally came with the poutine, so they threw on a mix of shredded mozz and cheddar...not the same, not the same"}
{"text":"Living in the area for a while, places to eat have come and gone. After Stem closed down, they left behind a hole of \"normal\" breakfast. In its wake, fast food joints and healthy living spots sprung up. Bacon Nation fills that \"bacon & eggs\" breakfast need just fine. Serving is fair, price is fair, more stars given if better coffee was served. Will I come back to try something else? Probably since the nice gentleman that works there have me a coupon."}
{"text":"Spent Monday afternoon here with the Bacon Poutine!! The fries were the best I have ever had! I am not a fan of soft/soggy fries! Perfect crunch with flavorful gravy! My friend had the BLT and an explosion of flavors! Sweet and tangy and original!! The Apple Mimosa are a MUST!! I highly recommend this place if you're in the area! Nice gentleman that did it all!!"}
{"text":"As you can imagine by the name, bacon is very key to this business. Which is awesome!!! Bacon on everything! I order the pig mac which was a good choice. Kinda like the entry level burger. I really really wanted to try the notorious P I G, but it seemed like a bit much for a midday meal. If i make it back to Toronto i will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Came in to Bacon Nation for breakfast. Clean and not bacon greasy as one might have expected :) Portions were perfect. Food was tasty. Bacon were not overly salty as well. The service was was great! Can't wait to come back to try their burgers!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during a Canada trip because we saw they had poutine. The decor inside was had a hipster vibe and they had some games for people to play while they waited for food (Cards Against Humanity, Connect Four, Jenga, Battleship...) The food was nothing special. They had smaller portions than expected. (Maybe compared to American standards? lol) One of the waitresses was rude and tried to rush our order as soon as we sat down because she was about to take a 11-person table."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my co-workers since it's close to work. When they order dishes with bacon, they're quite disappointed that the bacon is soggy instead of crispy.

The last time I was here, I ordered the Pig Mac (they changed their menu since the first time I came by). It's essentially an all-bacon patty sandwich. It had the same flavor as a NYC hotdog (trust me on this, I grew up in NYC). So needless to say, I wasn't impressed. The line-up to order is pretty long, since the guy who takes orders also brings the food out."}
{"text":"What can you say about a restaurant that closes down its storefront for weeks because of kitchen renovations, but fails to update its voice-mail or webpage to inform its customers?

I have tried for 2 weeks to call them to confirm they are still in business, but only got voice-mail. Only a generic outgoing message. So I actually went to their Spadina location and found a note on the door saying their ongoing kitchen renovations are extending past Labour Day. My Spidey-Sense is telling me that they are making more money from their food trucks and kiosks at Pan-Am Games, CNE, and Union Station than they are at Spadina. The note directed me to Union Station, where they only offer a partial menu at their pop-up kiosk. And quite honestly, the hygiene and skill level of the cooking staff there made me run away.

No comment on the food, since I did not get to try any. Service is a -100."}
{"text":"This location is nice for groups and a great place to get your bacon fix! 

The peanut butter milkshake was AMAZING! The sweat and salty mixture was perfect. The milkshake was prepared to order and not from some weird machine! 

The poutine topped with bacon was awesome. The gravy had a great flavor and they didn't skimp on the serving! It is the best poutine I've had so far! 

Finally, the bacon stix were tasty and cooked perfectly! They only have one location and one food truck so support this business and help them grow! Hope to see them in the US one day."}
{"text":"Cool place, right in the middle of Kensington Market. The patio is the place to be. Enjoying the great weather and the atmosphere with a little bit of people watching, lol. I had the all day breakfast special, eggs, bacon, toast, and fries. It wasn't that hot, the eggs could have been cooked more... the bacon was alright, not the best though. My friend had the Canadian Classic Sandwich Sandwich. Service was pretty good. All together 3 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my family using a Groupon and it was quite a good deal. Walking in, it's quite spacious compared to other Toronto stores. The decor and sayings on the wall were quite humorous and in tune with their brand. We came at about 12 pm and it wasn't full. 

Service was very good. The waitress was friendly and made sure we were taken care of. She also explained anything we needed clarification on. 

The food was pretty decent. Not bad at all. It's your typical breakfast joint with an emphasis on bacon. I also enjoyed the names of the dishes such as \"wake and bacon burger.\" It's not the best, but it's definitely not the worst in terms of quality. My only issue was the salad/greens that they served which was lacklustre and sort of sad looking. No big deal though. You're here for the bacon. 

All in all, enjoyed the service and the food here. Bacon Nation is a pretty decent choice of breakfast if you're looking to find a new place or if you love yourself some bacon."}

this place left me speechless, and not for nothing, theres just a hand full of restaurants that have done this. everything bacon...SERIOUSLY...if you want bacon, come here! every meal of the day, they will serve, from breakfast to dessert absolutely amazing. want bacon? come here! a very fun and cool place to come and eat, yes it is sit down and yes its a bit on the small size, but who cares when you have bacon on everything? stupidly easy to get to, transit all over and accessible. 
this place defiantly serves as a note that it stands out above anyone else as a niche type place. defiantly delivers and with a full on assault of bacon holiness.

i cannot foresee this place going out of business, and further i can see it pushing other businesses out. its a bit on the expensive side compared to your mcds, wendys or any other \"burger\" place you want to match it up towards. BUT! for a specialty where bacon is the onslaught it is priced fairly and theirs not another one going against it (to my knowledge) 

i cannot stress that the service was amazing, for a group of seven we were attended to with every detail met, which i considered to be amazing because three waitresses were taking care of my group and a party, with other diners as well. they smiled, they laughed, and they were super friendly.

AS good as this place is, i have three complaints against it, which is why it garners a 4/5 they do not have ice for drinks, and second i think it would be a home run if they served beer, because really, what goes together more then beer and bacon? lastly, the hours are a bit weird, they're closed at nine everyday? for one of the prime intersections in toronto, and a 24 mcds beside it, 9 kinda sucks.

Excellent food, excellent service which includes HAPPY wait staff who are laughing and enjoying the job, and a great location with lots to see and do while waiting for the food. 

a new toronto staple"}
