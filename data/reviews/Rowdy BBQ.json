{"text":"Takeaway: When you see local construction guys stopping in, you know its gotta be a good local spot!  Driving by this dim part of 51, the smoke had me do a u-turn. It was a sunny day, great because your only choice is sitting outside. While we waited 5-10 minutes for our food, we partook of the very very clean porty-potty out back. The road can be noisy, so I'd recommending not choosing the tables by the road unless you are by yourself.  My sons and I ordered a vertible sampler: ribs, cheese-steak, and pulled-pork. My son with the ribs said they could teach Applebee's what a half-rack really should be. Bones were soft, making me suspect these were braised first, which isn't a bad thing. But meat fell off the bone, but wasn't loose itself. Smokey flavor through-out the meat. The cheese-steak's meat seemed to be glazed, which was nicer than greasy philly-style. My other son wouldn't let me try his pork. The baked beans on the side of the ribs were awesome, with a sweet, tangy flavor reminiscent of three-bean salad.  Next time we drive thru to my parents, we'll be sure to stop again!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ, one of the few in Pittsburgh. The fact that they have no dining room doesn't deter this place from having lines. The big pig sandwich and the ribs are recommended. Prices are reasonable and the counter staff are very patient."}
{"text":"Rowdy BBQ catered our wedding. And it was amazing! They brought fresh sweet corn and cooked it AT our venue, which was in Riverside Park (the Chapel Shelter, look it up, it's a great venue).  They also provided us with a huge pile of beef brisket, which was amazingly tender.  Sometimes, it seems like at weddings the food isn't very good because it was cooked in bulk.  Steve from Rowdy gave us samples of the foods before our wedding, and they were flat out amazing.  Then, when he recreated everything in bulk, it was exactly the same which was way impressive. We also had mac n cheese, which was the perfectly sized macaroni and had little pieces of tomato.  We also had potato salad, fresh rolls, seasonal fruit, and...wait for it...vegan sausages (I am vegan)!  He didn't have them on the menu, but had some contact who provided him with super duper gourmet vegan sausages.  He will work anything out for you!  Steve and the Rowdy team is great. I should also add that two guys stayed and helped guide everyone through the serving process and helped with cleanup.  They were really cool guys, and very independent workers.  We were totally carefree at our wedding, not a worry about food!  Also, they are budget-friendly.   I am from California, and this sort of food there would cost an arm and a leg.  You would have to find some hipster restaurant that specialized in gourmet BBQ.  But here you have Rowdy!   Horray! Go to here  :)"}
{"text":"When its fresh its the best if its not its dry and terrible. I have been a few times and you can't get better when its right off the smoker when it sits around for awhile its like a whole different place. If they could be more consistent I would give them at least 4 stars.   I do love the sign they have out front for traffic passing by it always makes me laugh."}
{"text":"I recommend the Roethlisburger and some fries. Huge portions and if you get a drink they have free refills. The price is low for the sizes of everything as well. Only complaint is there is no inside seating, inside bathroom, inside anything. There's a few benches on the sides that do the job, but that doesn't work well in winter. Sometimes there is a longer wait for your food, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"It takes 15 minutes to get your food even if your the only there. The brisket sandwich was very bland and the pulled pork with cheese on it was bland. The cheese sauce especially. $4.50 for tiny little cheese balls. The mac and cheese was ok but I was expecting something a little more smoky. They need to use a different bbq sauce."}
{"text":"That was awesome. Brisket was great. That \"Whole hog\"was recklessly impressive. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Rowdy BBQ! First time here, and was pretty happy with my experience. I like this place for a number of reasons not just the food. This BBQ stand stays open year round with no indoor seating. It is essentially carryout no frills type of place. Which is in my opinion great because that says to me \" let our food talk for us, we don't need all that fancy pants stuff!\" I was greated by a extremely friendly lady that had a smile on her face and had no problem answering my barrage of questions about the place. I'll tell you what, before I even order I knew that my meal would be more than satisfactory with such a great personality. I kept it simple for my first experience and ordered pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw. The pork was flavorful and I'm a saucy type of person so, I doused it with some additional sauce which made this a tasty samich. I can't remember what I was charged for this lunch combo but it was a definitely a deal."}
{"text":"If there was a 3.5 star, this place would get it.  Let me just tell you, when the smoker is on, the food is incredible.  Consistency is key, and this place just isnt.  I have had pulled pork that was awesome, smokey, peppery, and moist.  Then I have had it dry, little flavor, and absolutely no pepper.  The quantity is great, but just not always the best quality.  The brisket the same as the pork. If they could be consistent, it would absolutely get 4 or 5 stars no problem."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and have never been disappointed. Chicken, Ribs, Pulled Pork, French Fries and especially the baked beans. My 13yr old daughter is a very picky eater, and she loves the ribs and mac n cheese (I don't do cheese, so I can't rate that myself). The BBQ sauce has a nice smokey flavor, but it's not overpowering. The ribs and chicken pretty much fall right off the bone. Extremely juicy and great flavor. I would, and do, recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I haven't tested the waters of the BBQ World in Pittsburgh as of yet, considering it's expanded since I left 9 years ago.  This place is a small stand off of Clairton Blvd, and I never thought much of it until I had my husband stop for dinner one night after I got a craving. The ribs were fantastic--fall off the bone and delicious.  I had the pulled pork, and it's what you expect for slow cooked pork. Add a little BBQ sauce and it's perfect. Ask for extra.  The macaroni is your standard fare, the wheel has not been reinvented, but it's good.  The price and service are great.   We'll continue to explore the menu, but you can't go wrong with their ribs or plain old pulled pork or brisket.  Just ask for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Deeelicious. I prefer to not have the cheese sauce on my pig. But that's personal preference.  Fries - on point. Those fried spicy cheese things with that dippy...mmmmmm. I wish it was not closed right now. The Triple cheesesteak :-P I bite my kids sandwiches when they aren't looking and I am not ashamed to tell you guys that (just not them) the \"piglet\" perfect for the little ones. Call ahead when it's busy is a good idea. Can I give 6 stars??? Been going there for years. Never disappointed. NOM NOM NOM from this family of 7. A++"}
{"text":"The best part of the meal were the fries. Ordered the combo with a half rack of ribs and chicken with a side of baked beans and fries.  Waited a solid 20 min or so after ordering for my order to be ready to grab at the window. The ribs and chicken were absolutely drowning in sauce which I don't like. Good bbq should have sauce offered on the side. The chicken was dry and pretty bland. The ribs were ok, a little over cooked and not much flavor from the rub. The beans were ok, nothing to get excited about. The house cut fries were awesome, which makes it a shame the rest of the meal was average at best."}
{"text":"What a varied menu for a BBQ shack! There is so much more than just BBQ; Rowdy also has sandwiches, cheesesteaks, burgers, and wings. I've tried quite a few things from their menu and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed.   My favorite thing to get is the ribs, which are fall off the bone with a mild smoky flavor. I like to get them with their original BBQ sauce with a side of their hot BBQ sauce. It's nice to have an option for sauces even if it's just two. When you get ribs, it also comes with a side.   Rowdy BBQ is a grab and go place and you usually get your food pretty quickly. Another reason to love Rowdy BBQ is that they're open year round!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out with some friends who have been raving about this place for a while now. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch hoagie with a side of mac and cheese, and both were REALLY good. The bun for the hoagie was so soft - I got my sauce on the side so it wasn't soggy which is very important to me. The sandwich normally comes with ranch, obvs, but I also got a side of their bbq sauce to try. Both sauces were awesome on the sandwich, and if you're feeling froggy mix them together! The mac and cheese had the tiniest spice to it, but it was really good too. My husband got the pulled pork sandwich, and he loved it too!  We ordered multiple takeout orders over the phone and there was a bit of confusion, but I am going to blame that on us. I will def be returning here when I am in the mood for some bbq!"}
{"text":"Route 51 is like war. It's hell.   I can tell you that being brave, patient and STAYING IN YOUR LANE YOU IDIOT...is worth it to get to this fantastic oasis of BBQ bliss.   It's an adventure that I hype myself up for quite a few times a year. Does this adventure end in the slaying of a dragon or saving a princess? Of course not! It ends in pulled pork and chicken, cheese steaks topped with jalape√±os, chili cheese fresh cut French fries and sides a plenty.   Enjoy and get two sandwiches, because NOT eating one on the drive home is just self inflicted torture. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Definitely satisfies my cravings for BBQ. I usually get the big pig sandwich, and it is consistently good. Just the right amount of barbecued meat, sauce, and cheese. The fries aren't bad either. Not too greasy and cooked just right. The only thing I thought was strange was that they put tomatoes in the macaroni and cheese. I personally think the macaroni could use a bit more cheese too. It's not bad, but not my favorite. If tomatoes are your thing, though, go for it! I recommend Rowdy BBQ to anyone driving down Route 51 looking for reasonably priced barbecue."}
{"text":"I have only had the pulled pork, Mac n cheese and a soda every time I come here but it's so good I don't want to get anything else. The Mac n cheese is just spicy enough to be noticeable. The pulled pork is very tender and the sauce is not overpowering. Kinda steep at $9 for all that."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch. Never had anything bad here. Side note the fries look burnt but are great."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ in the burgh.  This place is just absolutely phenomenal.  The kielbasa and kraut, the burgers, the pulled pork, the pierogies, the fries - it's all so yummy.  I love to order it with lemonade and sit outside and enjoy the day.  It's really great bang for your buck too - tons of food for super-cheap.  Their chicken sign is hysterical.  My only complaint about Rowdy is that there isn't another one in the North Hills."}
{"text":"Fairly decent barbecue in the 'Burgh. The ribs are properly smoked and quite tender, with a rather indistinct rub...I got a little chili powder taste from it, plus a bit of garlic, but not much else. They offer two barbecue sauces, which is actually just one, as they simply add cayenne to the house sauce to make it more spicy. The baked beans were very tasty, a nice blend of navy beans, black beans and kidney beans flavored lightly enough that I could actually taste the beans, which I appreciate. The fries are also very good, with a nice potato flavor that lets you know they're freshly made. I'm not doing handstands, but I'll go back and try more. I skipped the pulled pork, as I like mine with the traditional North Carolina vinegar sauce, and theirs comes with the house barbecue sauce...one I don't really like. The chicken was OK, but not smokey or unctuous enough for me to rave about. Again, I'll go back and try more."}
{"text":"Whose great idea was it to put a BBQ place on the busiest road in the whole entire city that serves bland, pulled pork, on soggy buns..?   I was actually excited to come down to Rowdy's and try some of their BBQ. I ordered their version of a spicy pulled pork sandwich with some french fries, and I honestly think the best part of my meal might have been the fries. Ouch.  My pulled pork sandwich was un-appealing. I didn't even enjoy eating it, and not to mention I think we waited 15 minutes for our food having been the only people there. What's that all about?  Maybe next time I'll come back to Rowdy's and things will be different, maybe their food will actually have some spice to it, maybe the food won't take enough time for me to drive to Uniontown and back, maybe I'll actually enjoy eating there; we shall see.   I will come back and give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Just like home cooking! Great food and friendly service.  Definitely add this to your list of places to check out!"}
{"text":"As someone who lives just north of Pittsburgh, I am definitely one of those people who grumbles whenever I have to cross a bridge and/or go through a tunnel to get somewhere.  There may be traffic and it may or may not add 30 seconds on to my drive, but the thought of it usually puts me in a grumpy mood and I'll act as if this extra 30 seconds means I have to pack an overnight bag.    Yet when I set out to get take-out from Rowdy BBQ, I was not even thinking about the location.  Until I was sitting in stand still traffic on 51.  With nowhere to go but forward, onward to the Brentwood Express shack for some barbecue I went.  I arrived in one piece, greeted by the Rowdy Rooster, thankful that delicious barbecue would be my reward.    I'm pretty sure I've been here before, but it's been so long ago I don't even remember what I ate.  And I'm pretty sure someone else drove which is why I didn't remember the traffic.  Nevertheless, I went with my usual pulled pork sandwich and mixed it up with the buffalo chicken sandwich.  One for now, one for later.  The pulled pork was good, though I was surprised by the cheddar cheese sauce as opposed to sliced or shredded cheese on top.  The buffalo chicken sandwich, which I got with provolone instead of the cheddar cheese, was better in my opinion than the pulled pork.  And after reading other reviews, I think I may have made a mistake by not getting any sides.  Should I brave 51 again, I will definitely repeat that buffalo chicken sandwich.  Along with some sides and maybe some brisket or one of those amazing looking cheesesteaks.  And next time I'll call ahead so I can spend my time sitting in traffic as opposed to waiting for my order.  Then maybe I can update my review and add another star."}
{"text":"My first pulled pork experience and it was good. Mouth watering go  back for seconds and thirds good.   As is the custom my team at work and I decided to have a potluck/food day. We decided on Rowdy's BBQ to provide the catering. The flavor of the pulled pork was savory and smokey. So good that I wanted to pinch myself. To ensure I wasn't dream eating.   My work team is roughly 16 people and we're always having food days. Let me tell you from Rowdy's you can order 5 pounds of pulled pork for less than $50.00 you can feed a lot of people with 5 pounds of meat.   I am now a pulled pork believer."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Had a Deluxe Cheesteak and fries. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"So yummy..We're from the south, so we generally eat Carolina style Bbq, but this place is on point. We were drawn in by the smoke and the smell wafting in the street. We had the brisket and the pulled pork. They were equally delicious. Perfectly cooked and tender, they both had very different flavors. The pork was slightly sweeter and the brisket was a little peppery. For people who are complaining about the sauce level, why didn't you just ask for light sauce? Clearly, it is not being dumped out of a bucket in the back room...appreciate that people in different parts of the country eat things many different ways. We also had the fried pierogies which were tasty and crispy and could only have been improved with the addition of sour cream. We'll be back on our next visit to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 3 years now wanting to try this place. Finally got around to it a few weeks ago, I was so disappointed!!! I'll stick to my chef boyfriends BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I love the tomato based sauce!!! The pulled pork is really good and so is the brisket. My only complaint is the Mac and cheese. It taste like there's mayonnaise in it or something and that is just not appealing to me. It's not the best bbq I've had but its also not the worst. When I want bbq this will prob be the place I go. Just wish the Mac and cheese was better."}
{"text":"Updating because as someone who has been coming here for years, this spot deserves 5 stars without a doubt. Best french fries around, delicious homemade bbq sauce, super incredibly tasty sandwiches.. you can't go wrong. The prices are affordable, the service is always excellent and prompt, and the food doesn't disappoint. Most recently, I ordered some cheese fries to go, as I had an intense craving. SO good. The fries are fresh cut and are never burnt. Everything here is so tasty!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for almost 30 years now and always drove past your place. I'm an incredibly picky eater but today I decided to give it a whirl. I had a pulled pork sandwich, Mac and cheese and the smoked brisket chili. I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner! Everything is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"We used Rowdy BBQ for our holiday party based on recommendations, and Steve and his team could not have been more pleasant and helpful as we figured out how much food, what to get, and how to get it to the party.  Steve was incredibly attentive and adjusted my order when we had last minute guests, and was honest about how much food we'd really need.  The Pulled Pork was a HUGE hit - nothing left!  And the Rowdy Mac'n'Cheese was also a crowd pleaser.  Great smokey flavors, AWESOME pricing, made from scratch, and a local owner who cares about the community?  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a fan, have tried this place more than once, each time I am disappointed, there are much better places to get barbecue in pittsburgh than Rowdy."}
{"text":"Did not like Rowdy BBQ! I very seldom hardly ever eat red meat so I never really paid attention or thought about eating @ Rowdy BBQ before until one day when I drove by & saw on their sign that they had fish sandwiches during lent I figured I'd stop & try one. Was not good at all!! The sandwich was huge & it was nice to be able to pick what toppings you wanted on it but it was sooo greasy & just did not taste very good! I only could eat about half of the sandwich & had no interest in finishing the other half later.  Their fries were decent but nothing special.  I can not judge them on their beef/pork bbq but I definitely do not recommend their fish.  Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review after having dinner tonight. The buffalo chicken sandwich was amazing and bigger than I thought it'd be. And the cheese fries were greasy and good. The meat, I guess, can be a little dry, but the buffalo sauce and ranch kept it very moist. From now on I'll just ask for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for bbq in the south hills, but certainly not the best.  The ribs are probably the best thing I've had there and they are just a little better than average.  They do have good cheesesteaks I will say.  Stay away from the burgers.  Not fresh, overcooked, and served on a skimpy bun."}
{"text":"We stopped by after leaving the skate park. Its a cute little shack and you can smell the BBQ & smoker a mile away.    I ordered the Big Pig, which had 1/2 l;b of bbq pulled pork plus cheddar cheese sauce on a hoagie roll. My boyfriend ordered half a rack as well as a brisket sandwich. He chose fries as his side with ribs. (sandwiches do not come with sides)   My sandwich was ok. Delicious actually with cheddar cheese sauce on it. It took me 3 different servings to finish it all.   My bf raved about the ribs all night & told everyone about how they fell off the bone.. although he did say that they lacked on sauce. The fresh cut fries were AMAZING. I think i tried the brisket and it was also good.   Anyways this was a nice change for us, My boyfriend loved it. I wish the sandwiches came with fries and they offered a bathroom other than a portajohn (which was %*#$%& disgusting. I ran away as soon as i first opened the door, which sucked bc the skate park also didnt have a restroom.)"}
{"text":"I adore this place. I've had  variety of sandwiches from them and they are always huge, delicious and reasonably priced. Their hot pepper cheese balls and Mac and cheese are also amazing.  It is an outside place on the side of route 51 which I suppose is a small downfall but it doesn't keep me from giving it 5 stars. They have a few picnic tables you can sit at but otherwise it's more of a take out type place.  You can also have them cater larger events which I've only experienced once but it was just as good as it is when I get a single sandwich. The food only takes them about 10 min to have ready for you as well or you can always call ahead and order too! I've had their chicken bacon ranch and buffalo chicken sandwiches and both are sooo good. I've also had their regular Philly cheesesteak and their chicken Philly cheesesteak and neither of those have disappointed either. Their pulled pork is equally amazing. The big pig sandwich is one of my absolute go to items on their menu, being that they are obviously a BBQ place as you can see from the name, you know their BBQ sandwiches have to be amazing.   Go here asap! You're welcome in advance. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try some pulled pork, and ended up getting \"The Whole Hog\" since it's pretty cheap and only about $1.50 more than the basic pulled pork sandwich. What we did not expect was a sandwich that was like the size of my forearm--it was literally a hoagie roll filled to the brim with meat, cheese, and some of the vegetables that we requested added to the sandwich. I've had big sandwiches, but I didn't see any way that it could've been picked up in its entirety and eaten with hands. This was definitely a steal in terms of value, considering that the pulled pork was as good as they advertised. Smoky, flavorful, and tender, all while not overly dry or saucy, making it a great comfort food."}
{"text":"Food gets a 3. Service gets a 0. Plus I just saw they were one of two places in the county to receive a food advisory because of, among other things, too many flies. I guess that's why it takes 20 minutes to make a sandwich.   I've been there half a dozen times. This was my last visit."}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place because of an Entertainment coupon and bought the BBQ Sampler.  Big mistake.  This is by far the WORST BBQ I have ever had in Pittsburgh, and that includes the likes of Eat N' Park.  I won't ever waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Stopped by this past Sunday to pick up a surprise catered lunch for our staff.  We got 4 racks of ribs, pulled chicken, mac n cheese, and potato salad.  Everything was really good, but the ribs were exceptional.  A bunch of our crew is planning on hitting this place up for dinner with their families now because it was so good.  Great Job Rowdy BBQ.  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We love their steak hoagies and the order of fries is enough to feed an army! Highly recommend! Never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I refer people here all the time that have never been. It's a random hold in the wall place with no indoor seating. It's like a hut with outdoor picnic tables. It's still worth it!!   You like burgers? Try The Roethlis-burger! You like pork? Get the Big Pig!  Amazing fries, quick service, super nice people!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place hundreds of times, always sayin \" I have to try that place\". So when planning a get together, I was looking around places to compare prices and value for the buck, and I thought Rowdy's was the way to go. The pulled chicken and pulled pork are very good with the smoked taste to them. They also served bbq sauce was on the side and the meat was portioned generously for the price. For a little extra, you can get rolls for sandwiches.    The place is set up for pick-up orders mostly. They do have out door seating with a few picnic tables. It is also set up along side of busy 51, so it can be a little stressful to get in and out of the parking lot, but it's a good location to attract business for them.     I do recommend them for catering and parties. They are reasonable, and make an effort to make sure you are satisfied with their service. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"From their feisty signs to their smokey bbq, I'm a fan of Rowdys BBQ.  Their pulled pork is most and flavorful and they also have some scrumptious cheesesteaks.  Full of flavor and personality - that's Rowdys.  The picnic tables outside are the only place to dine,  so if you plan on eating there make sure it's not raining.  If it is,  take it to go.  All sides are homemade as well.  We love the mac n cheese!  They also cater - so if you want your party to get a little Rowdy, just call ahead.    The awards don't lie - Rowdys is a great place for BBQ"}
{"text":"I went the next day and brought my wife to try this place again for dinner this time.  The first time was for lunch.  I still like the beans, was blown away by how great the fries were but I was really disappointed with the chicken and ribs this time.  I was tempted to drop the review to 2 stars.  The ribs were mushy and old tasting.  I would definitely recommend you stick to lunch if you are going to order these.  The white meat part of the chicken was bone dry and overall the chicken is unremarkable.  I would go back and try the pulled pork and get some more of those beans or if I am feeling like a splurge some more of those great fries."}
{"text":"Our family loves BBQ so when we crave it we head to Rowdy. It's a small place with no indoor seating. Outside there are a couple of picnic tables. It doesn't have to be summertime to enjoy Rowdy's food. They have take out year round!  Yum!  Tonight we ordered ribs, chicken, a burger, a chili cheese dog, coleslaw, and fries. Our family likes to share so we laid it out banquet style. I enjoyed a little of everything but enjoyed the chicken the most. Not only are their meats bathed in delicious BBQ sauce, they are also smoked. Not every BBQ place smokes their meats. If you are unfamiliar with the smoking process you need to know that it turns the meat pink on the inside. Some people freak out and think the meat is undercooked.  Their fries are handcut and their coleslaw is perfectly balanced. And don't miss out on their chili!  With the smoked meat it is fabulous!  I wish I could recreate it at home.  The next time you are thinking BBQ-think Rowdy!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to another BBQ joint out past Century III mall when I spied Rowdy, so I stopped. They have your basic roadside BBQ faire and I tried the Buffalo Pulled Chicken sandwich and Mac & Cheese. After a short wait in the cold, the lady tapped on the glass to let me know I could begin. The Buffalo Pulled Chicken was tasty, it would have been out of this world if not for the cold, untoasted roll(-1). Cold sandwich, cold bread, hot sandwich, hot bread. I hate when this basic tenant is broken. It's like putting a meal on a cold plate, boooo. The Mac & Cheese was a spicy one, with some peppers in it for zing, very tasty. Drinks are refillable. Everything was really good and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"As I walked up to the ordering window of Rowdy's BBQ I was eager to try a BBQ specialty place in PA. TX is filled with them and they all have their own styles and flavors.  Rowdy's smoked brisket sandwich was filled with fall apart in the bun tender brisket smothered in a sweet tangy bbq sauce. I always ask for extra BBQ sauce on the side for which I was accommodated. The bun was it's downfall though, their bun is tough and thin which contradicts it's soft yummy filling. Next time I may opt for a brisket plate if they offer one and just use a slice of soft bread to make my own sandwich.  Their mayo based potatoe salad was delicious but flavored with a bit to much onion for my taste buds. The coleslaw tasted exactly the same minus the onion, actually kinds flavorless all together. They offer more sides than I tried so I'll probably opt to get different ones next time."}
{"text":"We were driving by on our way from the airport headed to Fallingwater, and were really hungry. Kept driving by the usual chain places and hoping for better. Lo and behold, we passed Rowdy BBQ and the aromas called to us. Whipped a quick U-turn and my husband and I shared a delicious pulled pork sandwich and enormous bag of really good hand-cut fries- Yummy!   Walked around the side to check out the big smokers which were going full-blast loaded with chicken for Oktoberfest in Pittsburgh last weekend. The gentleman(the owner?) minding the birds was so nice-hope this place is a big success. Pittsburgh folks, go check it out-you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Can't believe I haven't reviewed or checked in yet.  It's been a while.  I love the sauce, really dig the ribs & brisket... but also love the pulled pork, chili, and chicken.  You have to check this place out if you dig barbecue.  This is probably my favorite sauce around the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"I think this place was formerly known as Brentwood Express.   And yes, it is in the Lost Land Of The Levitske Brothers, a corridor in the South Hills of Pittsburgh full of empty (haunted?) buildings and storefronts where no hipster or yuppie dare venture.   Don't be deterred.    If you like ribs, the black coffins with smoke billowing from them will beckon you easily.   We went there today, getting take-out for dear old Dad on Father's Day. He was cravin' ribs, and no one was disappointed.   Two racks of ribs more than fed the four of us. We got ourselves one rack \"mild\" and one rack \"hot.\" The \"mild\" was good, and the \"hot\" had enough kick to it but not too much that it would burn off your palate. The meat was smoked and had a breakfasty bacon/ham flavor to it. It wasn't falling off the bone, but tender it was.  The sides were excellent. Being a potato salad snob, I appreciated the chunky, perfectly unpeeled potatoes and crunchy green bell peppers. The cole slaw was a tangy, crisp, creamy tub of confetti. The beer battered onion rings were puffy, not at all greasy, and the breading stayed on the onion. The mac and cheese I think had tomatoes or red peppers in it, and bacon! Usually I avoid mac and cheese when I eat out, but I was glad I tried Rowdy's. Rowdy's even has...get this...deep fried pierogi, and being partly of Polish descent, I heartily approved of these cheesy spud packets being dunked in hot fat. Coming complete with melted butter and wilted onions, they made for a fine app.   Rowdy's has burgers, dogs, and other assorted sandwiches in addition to the BBQ delicacies.   Lest I forget to mention the fries. I had a couple since whenever you order deep fried foods in Pittsburgh, you tend to get a few free french fries as they stowaway with whatever else you order. About two or three of them found their way in my fried pierogi and onion rings.    Maybe I'll try the Creeping Death Habanero wings next trip."}
{"text":"Big bag of home cut fries were tasty!.  Mac & Cheese has little tomato chunks in it, the same way I make it, love it with tomatoes in it!!!..Nice touch!  The ribs were nicely smoked, ordered the hot BBQ sauce but got the middle and it was OK but not what we wanted.  Oh Yea, it is take out.  They do have a couple of picnic tables but a little to cold tonight to eat out!"}
{"text":"The fries taste great. The meat is okay, a little above average. The buns are awful. There's a long wait time and high prices.   Overall it's nothing special. I certainly wouldn't drive more than 5-10 minutes to get there."}
{"text":"I had always driven by and could smell the amazing smoking process they were doing whether it was during the day or late at night. Just never had the time to stop by to try, today I finally did. And let's just say it was well worth it! Let's just say coming from Texas I have very high standards to BBQ. And Rowdy's BBQ had bar none surpassed that! It is your typical order at the window sit outside and eat BBQ style motif. You can also order to go if you choose. They also provide catering as well. The variety of BBQ selections amazed me. It was like bring a kid in a candy store. I had their Mac-n-cheese which was phenomenal. Not overly cheesey but just perfect. Then the fries, oh man. They where nice and crispy from street to finish. By far the best fries I've had in a long time. Just hope I love them. The best I saved for last. I got a half rack of ribs which were by far the best! They had so much texture, smoky flavor, juiciness, mouth watering. I highly recommend Rowdy's BBQ to anyone cause it's well worth the smell and the taste!!"}
{"text":"As a usual her I was expecting some of Pittsburgh's finest BBQ. I was very disappointed in what we received and will never go back.   The Mac and cheese was old.  Maybe put in the Togo container a day or four ago and reheated.  I couldn't even get a fork full out, one giant clump even after I tried to reheat.  Ribs were ok. Nothing to remember.   Fries, awesome as alway.  But since four of us ate there three of us began running to bath room for the past 8 hrs.   As a local chef I should have known something was off when I went for the Mac and cheese.   Very disappointed and will not be going back any time soon, if ever"}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich was great.  The fresh cut fries were among the best I ever had.   Keep in mind that this is a stand, there is external seating but not  alot of parking.  However, the food is worth a trip!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation we had Rowdy BBQ cater our company Christmas party! We were not disappointed at all. So much food for the money. The owner is the one who dropped it off for us. Fantastic food awesome guy and it's makes a difference to a small business instead of one of the big chains. We will definitely be ordering again!! Thanks Rowdy!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and fairly priced as well definitely recommend if you are in this area they cater as well"}
{"text":"Has the best St. Louis style BBQ in the city. Their sauce is so good that we even by a bottle during pickup. Beef brisket sandwich is moist and tangy. 9 different styles of wings. Ordering in advance is recommended since great food takes a little longer but worth it."}
{"text":"Had the brisket BBQ which was a bit fatty and the sauce tasted like BBQ sauce out of a bottle.   I'm still searching for a local BBQ place that can compete with Clem's.  This place has only outside seating which means for a good portion of the year is only takeout.  We were the only people there when we ordered, though there was one other person that ordered after us. So the place wasn't busy and they do primarily takeout business. You would think they could get a simple order correct. But no.  When we got home we had the sandwiches, we had the onion rings (which were beer battered and very good), but no coleslaw. This was not a complicated order and all they do is take out at this time of year, how do you screw up an easy order like that?  I would have called to complain but what's the point. It was too far to go back and get the coleslaw and the rest of the food wasn't good enough that I'm going back anytime soon. If you are in the area and want a quick bite it's not a bad option but it certainly isn't worth making a special trip for this barbecue."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Some sauces can be annoying and overwhelming but I enjoyed this restaurant's BBQ. Great place to go!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend decided to stop here on the way to pick my son up and I have to say I'm extremely glad that he did! From the outside it doesn't look like much but I guess good things do come in small packages! I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and a side of Mac and Cheese and he got the mushroom burger with fries. Both of the sandwiches were huge (I cut mine in half and got more than two meals worth out of it) and so were the portions for the sides. The fries were amazing but I wasn't the biggest fan of the Mac and cheese, it had diced peppers in it and it really threw the taste off for me. He was nice and shared his fries with me and we definitely didn't leave hungry. I'll definitely be back to try out some of their other choices!!"}
{"text":"This is a damn good local BBQ place. First I'll start with the small things that kept them from being a 5 star:  Brisket - was a bit fatty for my liking. This is a very personal opinion, some people prefer this. I just prefer leaner cuts.  Out door seating only - it was a hot day and eating hot BBQ was overwhelming.  Now let me tell you about something amazing, their Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich.... Oh. My. Fucking. God. I wanted to weep into my fries once it was over."}
