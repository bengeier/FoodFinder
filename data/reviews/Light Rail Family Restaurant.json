{"text":"This is your standard Neighborhood Restaurant Group Greek style. Good witch staff friendly prompt the ownership kind of elusive and standoffish our family goes there about once or twice a month and will continue to do so all in all a pretty good place"}
{"text":"I came here with my mother for a Sunday brunch, but was some what disappointed. The service was good and the waitress was having issues, but the waitress was being diligent. The food however was the issue the portions were okay but the food tasted Bland and some of it tasted like it was frozen before. We got fried pickles put the pickles weren't homemade or fresh it tasted as if they just took out of a jar fried them. I had a portabella Burger but the mushrooms didn't have flavor I don't know what it was and the burger was nothing special by any means. Butterfly and described anything it was the onion rings they didn't taste fresh. If they fix the food flavoring maybe I will come back, but till then I will go some where else."}
{"text":"Ms. Cathy was great! Excellent customer service. I've driven past this place several times but never stopped in. The food was great (I had a salad and salmon patty). I was pleasantly surprised. I will come back again and try their breakfast! Thanks Ms. Cathy."}
{"text":"This family own restaurant seems to have everything you can think of on their menu.  I love having their baked chicken with dressing and gravy that is on their Thursday's special. I am never disappointed! Their breakfast here is also very enjoyable. The staff is friendly and service is always fast!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on breakfast only which was plentiful, well prepared and reasonably priced. I would return if back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not bad...only problem is 90% of the time I've been here our food has come out cold!  They say they cook to order so for a party of 2, I don't understand why the food is cold or lukewarm."}
{"text":"I won't  here again. I'm rating it with one start due to the staff. The food was OK.  I definitely did not like the  environment. The host that sat us, he had no personality,  and he was very unprofessional. Spend your money elsewhere, with merchants that appreciate your patronage!"}
{"text":"awesome restaurant. I love you guys. this family restaurant is the best.Family Restaurant are some of the hardest working people.  Anyone complain about this restaurant like the David V. and Rick B. is a super duper weirdo. Why does hard working people have to deal with stupid these yelp reviewer? they are bad gossiper with no friend or no one to talk to? David and Rick you guys are reason why this world is horrible.  If you dont like something. then offer to help.  Everyone in the world is doing the best they can with what they have.  Keep infecting yelp with lies and slanders, for what?  your review only show what a narrow mind person you really are.  You are like the crazy guys that stand in middle of the roads yelling blaspheme that no one will ever pay any attention. Be a better man and help someone instead of going online and threaten people with little comment like restaurant have to kiss your hinds in order to get 5 star reviews. Grow some balls and be part of the solutions not the problem."}
{"text":"The was just ok. Nothing was bad it just wants mind blowing or anything. I wanted mac and cheese but they only sell certain sides on certain day. I got the salt and pepper catfish it was good. I was got banana pudding and it taste like something you would get at school as dessert."}
{"text":"Good food and service with good sized servings.   Nothing fancy but good reliable diner fare."}
{"text":"On our way to Charleston SC, we stayed overnight in Charlotte, NC.  This restaurant was recommended by some locals.  They said the breakfast choices were very good.   We were here on a Friday morning and the place was busy with a lot of customers picking up to-go orders.  There were plenty of booths available and we seated ourselves.  I found the service very friendly and helpful.   The breakfast menu offers a variety of options at reasonable prices.  There were four people in our group and everyone was satisfied with their food.    Our order came very quickly and the portions were generous.  I had my usual eggs, bacon, home fries and wheat toast. The homefries were very good and browned just right.    Note: I love that in the south, after your meal, a lot of restaurants offer to refill your beverages, like coffee and sodas, in to-go cups.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  My extended family has breakfast at the Light Rail regularly and we love it.  The food is delicious and the staff is friendly, fast and accurate.  Just today there were 14 of us eating New Year's breakfast.  We had 2 servers and they took all our orders efficiently and them brought our food quickly with no errors.  I had the \"Belt Buster\"--2 pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 sausage patties.  I had blueberry pancakes, but there are lots of options.  My sister got the Western omelet and we shared.  There was plenty of food--enough to take home some leftovers--and it was delicious.  During the meal our servers unobtrusively kept our coffee cups refilled and brought more cream when we needed it without us needing to ask.  I highly recommend the Light Rail Restaurant. During"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.... Used to be the Flamingo, but changed names a few years back....  ALWAYS good food, good service, good prices. We have our family reunion in the private room in the back every August.  This place is wonderful for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Breakfast this morning reminded me that this is one of my favorite places in town"}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch. The service is always is always great. You're seated right away, the food is brought out very timely and the wait staff is always around with refills or just to check on me. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Breakfast is available at all hours. It's always busy at lunch time, but they handle it with ease."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good service. A great place to go when you don't know what you want to eat or with a crowd of people with varying taste. Delicious homemade pound cake."}
{"text":"I was suspicious upon entering this restaurant as it was a Friday night around dinner time and the parking lot was not very busy, and when you look at the restaurant from the road, it is not well lighted. A friend had recommended Light Rail Restaurant and said she eats there often when they are in this part of Charlotte. So with that recommendation we (a large group of us) went for dinner without a reservation. When we got there we were warmly greeted and made to feel quite welcome. We were led to the room in the back which can seat a lot of people. We were a dozen and they quickly set up the tables for us to have a long table and this was a private room for us only for the meal. The menu really has something for everyone. It has grilled meats, fried meats, you can eat healthily or pig out. I had the Friday special, which was pork over a bed of stuffing (kind of like Thanksgiving turkey), with a side salad,rolls and cabbage. Others had the meatloaf (which looks wonderful), grilled shrimp, the grilled chicken, so many choices. All of the meals come with choice of bread, two sides (okra, greens, beets). There was even pudding on the side list, so you can have a dessert without paying more. This is not a fancy restaurant, and the food is not complicated food. I would equate it to diner food that you find while driving in New Jersey. I say this in a complimentary way. I love diner food in New Jersey. So if you want to have a good meal, for a reasonable price (less than $15 per person including tip, tax, meal, drink, dessert), then this is your place. Also a shout out to our waitress Terry, she did a great job. Everything was brought as ordered and she had a fun personality. Also the guy at checkout was quite polite and conveyed we are appreciative of your business, which was nice.  I will definitely return on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Weekend Breakfast special 2 eggs done anyway you want, bacon, home fries and choice of toast and biscuit only $5.99 --"}
{"text":"We stopped at Light Rail restaurant because we were driving by.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly.  The server Terry explained that the food was fresh and made in-house.  We had chicken and dumplings and the rib eye steak.  Everything was delicious.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  The service was great.  The customers all seem to be regulars and they all know each other.  The treated us like we had been going there for years.  It was a wonderful experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Not the fanciest place but the food makes up for it. It is diner food but sometimes that's just what you want! Delicious fried chicken tenders, awesome club sandwiches! Their salads are nice and crisp. Desserts are a little dry and eh but the rest of the food is enough to make me a regular here."}
{"text":"I have been going to breakfast here twice a month for the last 8 years or so... as a member of a small Club, we would always have between 20-60 people in attendance.  One main reason we go there is that it is convenient, and the staff member that takes care of our group is terrific! This past Sunday, two of our members that typically come only for coffee as they are on a very specific diet...  they were told they had to order some food to stay... in other words.. a 'cover charge' to just be there.  Never mind that they ordered coffee that is just barely drinkable IMHO for $1.99. (Cost to restaurant maybe $.08 per cup)  That's more than Starbucks gets for a coffee!  They ordered a salad to go.. that was about $3.50 which got them out of hot water... so to speak. The staff members that I asked about it could only shrug and say... \"We don't make the rules\".   My guess is that our Club spends in excess of $1100 per month in the restaurant. So... the short-sided thinking on their part should cost them the business in most situations.  In this case.. probably not...  It will however cost them my business, no matter what the circumstance is.  Bill K."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  A diner experience that I alway go back for.  I recommend the breakfast,  there is nothing like a thick grilled bologna sandwich with egg. Simple but fast and delicious."}
{"text":"I won't eat here unless it's a last option.  I was next door at the Gun Store taking a class on Saturday. It's a 10 hour class and to keep the class going and get done we were told we could work thru lunch. We should go next door to this restaurant, get the order to go and come back and keep learning. Good plan!  While the plan was great this restaurant is not. No one working there looks remotely happy to see anyone. There was a man there who looked to be in good shape but just rude, short and generally unhappy. He never greeted anyone. He never made any eye contact. He took my order wrong and then acted like it was someone else's fault when I mentioned it. Here is a clue. When you make a $1.50 mistake you don't bill them for it. You comp it and move on. Just a hint. He seemed like he had better things to do.  The front door area smelled like a truck stop bathroom and they were trying to kill the smell of urine with perfume. Industrial strength perfume.   The menu is pretty normal fair and the food is average. Anyone reading this could order the same frozen crap from CISCO and make the same average food they are making without much fuss.   The other staff seemed to act just like the manager or owner guy. They all moped around and I would encourage them to find a place were life is happier and they end up working for people who care.  The dinning area looked like something out of 1970's Communist Russia. It was old, dirty and disgusting. The carpet has to be well over 30 years old and dirty as ever.   Frankly you would have thought they would have been happy with 15 take out orders at lunch. Take out is the good for sales. You don't give up any sitting space and your staff is not burdened with waiting on anyone, but that is not a problem there since there were only about 4 - 6 people eating there on a Saturday at lunch.  The clue there should have been that no one was eating during a weekend lunch. How this place stays open is amazing to me.  Over all I think a 1 star rating is still a bit high. They should look around and see what they are up against. This place should have been closed 10 years ago."}
{"text":"As usual the Yelp reviews are way left or way right.   I have eaten lunch here a dozen times.   It's always consistent.   Decent prices for a decent home cooked style meal.   You can find this \"Greek\" style home food spots at atleast a dozen places all over CLT, they are about the same.  The staff has always be friendly and hustled."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy meal without any extra bells and whistles, or sauces or fancy seasonings. This fit the bill perfectly. Lightly grilled salmon with a side of both broccoli and beets. I knew exactly what I was eating. The service was very friendly and quick, and the price always very reasonable. One little pet peeve, though, sweeping the floors around us while we're enjoying our meal. I hope they're more conscious about that in the future. Great little diner worth checking out for a nice, quiet home-style meal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had my order to go but the servers, 2 women both were attentive but as was noted in one of the reviews were not overly friendly.  When you have a small business like this, customer service is EVERYTHING, you better be schmoozing each and every customer that walks through the door.  You can not afford to be lazy, enough with that.  I ordered a Sausage and Egg on Muffin to go and a Large OJ.  The muffin was awesome, 2 sausage patties, I couldn't tell but 2 eggs, I believe, on a great toasted muffin. That is saying a lot if you have been to McDonald's ordered a sausage and egg muffin, and it has shrunk over the years, muffin raw, sausage small...well you know.  I did talk with the server and prodded her a little bit with small talk and she did even give me a smile before I left. They should be more engaging.  I Will return, seems casual and comfortable, front end of the house is a little run down but still homey like when I was a youngster and the back end is updated but a little colder in my opinion.  Give it s shot, it is not a Bistro, some fancy restaurant, just a easy going meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Nice and simple diner/restaurant. Foods not to die for but it's definitely always on point whenever I go. I will definitely keep this restaurant in my rotation for My Glory and I!!"}
{"text":"This was very good-we went for breakfast and our server, Cathy, was just perfect. She guided us to the best choices, kept our coffee cups filled and was friendly and    Sweet. Our eggs were good, actually asked how we liked our bacon and steered my husband to some excellent French toast. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst, most overpriced restaurants in Charlotte. Food tastes old and frozen. Even the soda and ranch dressing were inconsistent. Our waitress never even smiled. Would not return."}
{"text":"So it's a brisk 38 degrees today and my lunch partner wants to visit Light Rail for lunch.  I walk into their restroom and am shocked at how cold it is in there.  Great!!  I get to sit on a frigid toilet in an uncomfortably cold restroom just because my lunch partner made a poor choice for lunch today?  This is a lesson I only need to learn once.  I understand that way back in the day people were accepting of a non-heated or cooled restroom, but those days are long behind us.  Please run some duct work into your restrooms already so your PAYING CUSTOMERS will have a reasonable restroom experience in your establishment.  It's sad that these words even need to be stated in 2016."}
{"text":"You can expect good inexpensive food and usually good service. Every day they have a sheet of that days specials as well as a full menu if none of the special s don't jump out at you.  Coworkers and I occasionally make this our lunch spot. Can't beat the prices, and they give you 5% off if you pay with the good 'ol American cashola!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service they really know how to make you feel at home....I ordered the perch filet and fries and it was the best fish ever....it was fried right and nice and hot."}
{"text":"Best breakfast on the south side of Charlotte!!!! The bacon is cooked perfectly, home fries are the bomb and the sweet tea is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast this morning at Light Rail. No frills, nothing outstanding other than they do quick order breakfast really really well. (Maybe they do other things, but today was breakfast.) They were not especially busy and our meals were brought to us quickly. Plenty of good coffee, too.  My wife chose the Eggs Benedict and it was presented very nicely a good portion with two eggs poached and plenty of Hollandaise. I thought the sliced ham was just okay with a rather tough skin on it. But the flavor was there and the meal was enjoyed.  I chose the corned beef hash and eggs with home fries and toast. A reasonable potion of hash, the eggs were poached nicely and plenty of potatoes. The toast was done right, not too dark, and served dry as requested.  Good and friendly service. If you're looking for a good breakfast, here's your spot. Yes, they have wifi as well."}
{"text":"I work two minutes down the street so i pick up lunch here often and sometimes breakfast when i have time. I called in my order this morning about 20 minutes before i got there expecting that it'd definitely be ready by the time i got there because it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. I get there and have to wait another 10 minutes for my food, which also then makes me late for work. Another lady beside me had been waiting 20 minutes for a order with nine plates, but she called them in over a hour ago. I get to work to find they didn't give me the ranch they charged me and my fries were cold. What did i just spend $11 on? I called back up there requesting they make me fresh fries and give me the ranch i paid for. When i get up there to pick it up the guy was standing at the the counter with a brown bag with my food on it waiting for me. He didn't make any eye contact, rudely handed me my bag and said have a good day while still looking down. Just seemed really rude and not good customer service."}
{"text":"I judge a breakfast place by a couple of things. One, do they have real butter in the little plastic tubs on the table? I'm not wasting precious carbs on a pancake slathered with margarine. Two, is the bacon legit? We've all had that weirdly flavorless, transparent cheapass bacon. Not wasting precious calories that way either. Third, are the grits creamy or watery? Light Rail passes all three tests. It's not fancy, it's not artisanal, it's not farm-to-fork. It's a dive-y diner that's gonna get your eggs right, keep your coffee cup filled, and make you a pancake like your Grandma used to - complete with Aunt Jemima syrup. Service is fast and friendly. Portions are generous, not ridiculous. You'll eat your breakfast, not waste it. If you want bacon and eggs that come from heirloom chickens and pigs that were fed on acorns and chia seeds, keep looking. But if you want some damn breakfast, Light Rail will cook you up some damn delicious, old school diner breakfast."}
{"text":"Ho-hum food and poor service. And a feeling like you went back 40 years in time with the decor. The only good quality about this restaurant are the prices."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've had. Ordered eggs, country fried Steak, grits, and biscuits. All perfectly prepared. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast here...love the corned beef hash esp.  Very popular go early on weekends. ...good coffee too...funny waitresses"}
