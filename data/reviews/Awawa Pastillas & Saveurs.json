{"text":"Egyptian cafe that opened recently beside the YMCA at De La Montagne. It's really small and cozy. Their pitas and salads are fresh and the coffee is good. Not a chill ambience and not a place you would go to study or relax. It's more of an on-the-go cafe. Since they just opened, the staff is still learning but they are all friendly and nice. I would come here again if I am passing by and in a hurry to grab a bite but wouldn't make a day plan to come here with friends or as a regular."}
{"text":"This place was so close to the hotel where I was staying and I love pastilla, so obviously I had to check it out.  It was delicious!

I had the Chicken Pastilla Combo ($10.99).  The pastilla here is more like a pastilla wrap.  The chicken pastilla wrap was filled with spiced chicken chunks with vegetables and eggs.  It was topped with icing sugar and toasted almond slices.  I loved the sweet and savoury tastes.  The pastry was crispy.  The filling was generous and had lots of chicken in it.  The pastilla was definitely the star of the meal.

Other reviewers raved about the salads but I have to say the salads I got were ok, but nothing to write home about.  I got the cauliflower salad which was mostly cauliflower, broccoli and carrots, and also the apple coleslaw which was apples and cabbage in a creamy dressing.  They sprinkle dried cranberries over the salads.  You get your choice of 2 salads with the combo. The vegetables in the salad were crunchy and tasted fresh, but they weren't really wow.  I also found the apple coleslaw too creamy, but I don't like creamy salads.

You also get a drink with your combo and they had different types of pop, water and get this: San Pellegrino sodas!  And you can get a San Pellegrino soda with your combo without an extra charge.  Woo hoo!  I got the pomegranate and orange mix San Pellegrino.  This is awesome because most places charge you extra for San Pellegrino!  They do charge you $1 extra here if you want Perrier though. 

The girl serving me was super nice and asked me if it was my first time there.  When I told her it was, she explained their menu to me and told me what was their most popular dish (the chicken pastilla).  Some of their salads were running low and she said if I wanted that salad it wasn't a problem she would just make more.

The place is not that big, so I got takeout and brought it back to my hotel room, but there are some seats if you want to eat there.

I am definitely coming back the next time I'm in Montreal!  Maybe I'll try the beef pastilla next time..."}
{"text":"Tiny cubby hole of a place right next to the downtown Y, specialising in Arabic - style wrap sandwiches. All meat is certified Halal, you have a choice of white or whole wheat pita, there are various salads to choose from, and soft drinks or tea/coffee, all included in the meal combos.  My chicken kafta was very tasty, as was the red onion, fennel, and orange salad, but the salad was a tiny little one. All meals come in small disposable plastic containers, plastic cutlery, tea/coffee in paper cups  Not too eco-friendly, but  good, portions not for the really hungry, prices reasonable. Wifi, available, ask for password at the counter."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for a quick lunch with a friend and was delighted by their choice of salads. I got a small container of salad for under 5 dollars that would be the perfect light lunch. Strong votes for their apple coleslaw which they top with dried cranberries and a wedge of crispy pita bread. 

My friend tried their veggie wrap and said it was great but she agreed that the true winner was the apple coleslaw. 

Friendly service, easy set  up and a delicious lunch! Can't wait to go back!"}
