{"text":"Nice atmosphere and reasonable prices. Food was just ok...not bad but probably won't be in a hurry to come back. Restaurant was empty but they had the check on my table before I put my for down...wierd service."}
{"text":"Fine for tourists, but locals gotta go to china town for this stuff"}
{"text":"Very tasty. We just had the shrimp fried rice and sauteed shrimp with mixed vegetables. The tea is $5 per person which caught us off guard but otherwise was a pleasant experience. Given this is located in Mandalay Bay, it's convenient for hotel guests staying in Delano as well. Recommend this place to others for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is bc my extremely mediocre and overpriced black bean chicken temporarily ruined my appetite & left me more room for the Rio seafood buffet the next day. Then again, maybe I subconsciously wanted to pay a lot to eat blah food - being from LA, how did I expect this place, catering mainly to drunken tourists that have never had authentic bb chicken, to compare with the real stuff in LA? Also, I was particularly upset that I discovered the Burger Bar was also at Mandalay Bay right after eating here. I had been jonesing for a burger alllll night and specifically had my mind set on burger bar, but forgot which hotel it was in. On the bright side, my skimpy little shreds of chicken accompanied by a few bell peppers was probably a lot less caloric."}
{"text":"The wonton soup at the Noodle Shop was just what my tummy needed after indulging at buffets along the strip for the last couple of days.  The broth was hot and flavorful, and it helped soothed my throat which has grown weary from inhaling the smoke filled air of the casinos. The long thin noodles were a lot of fun to eat and were very tasty.  The wontons were good, but I don't think they were as good as other wontons I've had.  They offered generous portions which left me comfortably full.  However, the downside is the price-- $13 is a lot for a bowl of wonton soup!  I'd probably see what other Asian restaurants there are in the area before I return to this one."}
{"text":"I thought I would try the Sea Bass. ($32).  The server said that it was good and told me to get the one with the sauce.  It was greasy and tasteless.  It was served on a (thin) lettuce bed.  I also ordered a vodka cocktail.  Neither one were very good.  What a waste of time and money.  I should have read these reviews first.
NEVER AGAN"}
{"text":"Hello food network, we need intervention - please run an episode of restaurant impossible. Their 16 dollar bowl of pho is awfully bland, you are certainly better off driving 2 miles off the strip to eat a more graceful bowl of pho. I also had their fried rice and it was awful as well. For a restaurant inside a major hotel, I expected plenty more."}
{"text":"Not bad if you do your homework and read the Yelp reviews. From what I have read
1. Don't order the Pho. 
2. Noodle dishes tend to be salty.
3. The pictures do not have much vegetables in the noodle dishes.

The beef chow fun and the chow meiin have gotten the best reviews on Yelp so far. So I ordered the beef chow fun. Asked for low salt. And also paid an extra $3 for additional vegetables. In the end, I ended up with a decent meal. I may try this with the chow mien next time."}
{"text":"My tip: don't eat here.

The restaurant itself is located inside Mandalay Bay, but is tucked away far enough that you're not inhaling cigarette smoke from the casinos.  The staff is very sweet.  These are the only positives.

The food is bland and really not good at all (we had 4 different dishes).  In fact, I believe I got a small bout of food poisioning.  :("}
{"text":"This place is terrible...don't know why still many people been here.
Just look the price that compare with the food we order, totally not worth it! 
For the food quality, I only can say it pass the lowest level. Many other places can cook much better than here.
In general, not recommended it!"}
{"text":"So....I decided to ignore the 234 review 2 star rating......and you get what you deserve.......2 stars at best.  Over priced (yes, even for Vegas standards) and just ok to mediocre food.  Do yourself a favor and listen to those who took the time to review this place.  Mandalay Bay, time for a change in tenants........"}
{"text":"The food definitely was not anything special. I would say it was a step up from a Chinese dollar scoop. More likely to get better food at a PF Changs. But the service was fine and we did not have to wait long for the food. Our glasses never went empty and the hot jasmine tea was bottomless."}
{"text":"The pad Thai was absolutely disgusting. The Mongolian beef was average. I would have been happier at a Panda Express. It's sad because the service was good but we should have taken a clue when the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"I've been there in October 2014 and it was great. Waiters were nice, place was nice and the Pad Thai chicken I ordered was good"}
{"text":"Food was decent price for it being vegas, but the food was really dry. I had the roast pork on rice. It was relatively dry and the rice was badly cook. How do you mess up cooking rice?"}
{"text":"I grew up around authentic Chinese food and thought this was pretty good.  I suspect the bad reviews come from a higher price for Chinese food.  But i paid $125 for pasta in another restaurant in mandalay and $20 for a beef sandwich next door for lunch at the seabreeze cafe so the prices are in line.  If you want chinese food here i hope the other reviews don't put you off.  I ordered mongolian beef and the bbq mix which included hainan chicken."}
{"text":"Ugh, what a waste of a meal.  It was certainly overpriced, but the bigger problem is that the food was flavorless.  The pho broth was watered down, the beef in the pho was tough, and the noodles were swollen.  We got other dishes and all the same story.  The Mandalay Bay could do much better, especially with a restaurant right off the casino floor and in a high traffic area."}
{"text":"I wish I saw the reviews before we went here.  Food was average, that's being nice.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Save your money and go somewhere else. Panda Express is way better."}
{"text":"I had the hot & sour soup and chicken shrimp & beef with garlic sauce.  It was OK.  At the time, it hit the spot.  I came down with a case of food poisoning, but I am not sure if it came from here.  I guess I will never know."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food with small portions for the price. I'm not a good cook but when I was eating I felt even their special Curry Tofu was something I could make at home and taste the same with sauce from a jar. I was starving and alone so I ducked in a booth and ate everything pretty much anyway. Service was very polite, refilled my water before I realized it was low. Certainly not somewhere I'd recommend but it was okay for what I needed at the moment.
(I was debating between here and some of the cheaper, less well reviewed buffets in the area and the price difference with tip probably would only have been $10. If I had a little more time and energy I might have done that.)"}
{"text":"way over priced for mediocre food. Soup was Luke warm. Dinner came out 3 minutes after we got our soup. $90 for two people for less than average food."}
{"text":"Most expensive Chinese food ever!! Sad thing is that the food looked and tasted like it was the 1/4 of the price charged... very, very, disappointing!!! We weren't even asked once if we wanted our soda topped off !!"}
{"text":"This is the place for you ONLY if your idea of tom yum is vegetable broth with shards of celery, canned wood ear mushrooms, canned tomatoes, gluey vermicelli, and too much siracha, or possibly ma po tofu consisting of little squares of warmed tofu in a brown sauce with frozen peas and carrots.  The only upside was that my soup spent a lot of time in the microwave and was too hot to eat for 15-20 minutes. We were hopeful that the food here would hit the spot after a long day of traveling, but instead it left us hungry (after we couldn't eat the food) and mad at having spent $50 (that did include drinks:  what was advertised as a house special martini but turned out to be gin & cranberry juice in a martini glass, and a peculiarly orange \"Thai iced tea\"). Please  avoid this place so no other unsuspecting travelers make the same mistake."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the Noodle Shop twice while we stayed at Mandalay Bay.
It was 4 pm on Sunday the first time we were there. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks. We ordered Mongolian Beef ($17.5), Hong-Kong Style Pan-Fried Noodles with Seafood ($18.5), Thai Iced Tea ($5.5), and house sparkling wine ($8).  The food was delicious and the right amount. My Pan-Fried Noodles were flavorful and I enjoyed every bite. My husband enjoyed his Mongolian Beef tremendously too. 

We had a http://restaurant.com coupon for $25 off. Our bill came out to be $37.2. This is not a cheap place, but the food tastes good and it's convenient if you stay at Mandalay Bay.

We went back for dinner at 8:30 pm on Monday night. Again we were seated immediately. We shared Yang-Chow Fried Rice (with BBQ Pork and Shrimp, $14), and my husband had a Coke ($4).  The food was good and the waitress was attentive. The price of the meal is much friendlier this time. 

Overall it's a solid Chinese restaurant. I took off one star because of the price. We will go back again if we stay at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Don't do it. Just keep walking... walking away.

The food is terrible. Service is as bad as you'd suspect in a casino restaurant.

Just don't do it."}
{"text":"Ok spot. Way too pricey considering many many many many other asian hybrid places do it better."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, worst dinner I've had in a long long time. Service sucks, don't waste your precious time and money"}
{"text":"Cozy spot I'd say, I got the hot and sour soup to start and It was fantastic!! I also got the kung pao beef and that was also pretty good. The thai style chicken curry on the other hand was a letdown, seemed promising and for 18 bucks it was a waste!

A bit pricey too, 16 a plate seems pretty steep."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would.  The food is bad and the service is worse.  We told the waiter our pork was raw, he took it, left and never came back.  And they charged us for it.  They also brought the wrong main dish.  I blame myself for eating here"}
{"text":"If eating food counted towards your gambling debt than this place should be considered part of your losses. In fact this place is a total loss, a \"bad beat\". 

I had a beef stew over rice, which came out quickly but it wasn't anything special. Brother had a pad thai dish which he said that he's had better.

The place is over priced for average food, but I can't complain about the price, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was very good but server openly asked for us to give him a tip....we were giving him a tip by the way... but it wasn't what he wanted. I think his name was Sam so if you get him he'll make you give him a tip he likes not what you want to give him. He wasn't very friendly either as the other staff were. Just beware so he's the reason for 1 star."}
{"text":"Best Har Gow and Chow Fun!!!

My boyfriend and I went for dinner while we were in Vegas for a week for a convention and loved it so much that we convinced  our group (6ppl) to go for lunch 2 days later!  It is a perfect casual noodle/Asian cuisine restaurant.  Which is great for a casual experience when you tend to eat such heavy, large meals in Vegas.

Amazing Har Gow with a bit of expected wait. The chow fun was delicious... Even when I ordered it without onions or bean sprouts. The pad thai was a tad oily so we asked for light oil the 2 time and enjoyed it. Great hot tea. 

The service was a little sub pair ESP for Vegas. The food out-weighed my opinion of this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on our anniversary.   This was by far the worst Chinese food we have had in years with prices 2-3 times what you expect to pay at a decent establishment like PF Changs.   We order the hot tea. This was $10..... a pathetic cucumber salad $10, cup of egg drop soup $7.50 and some pork sliders $12.  All of it was sub par and not even close to expectations for the price paid...... we noticed that there were very few diners in the establishment...... perhaps because nobody ever goes back...."}
{"text":"We got in late and needed some food fast. So, we chose to eat in the hotel we were staying at. Noodles sounded perfect. 

Aside from the prices that were 2x what we would have expected, the food was mediocre at best. 

The Singapore fried rice noodle dish was not much like it was advertised. Wheat noodles, with curry and a few shrimp and slivers of pork. Oh, it was fried. They were just ok. The steamed sea bass was the best of the night. Moist, cooked perfectly. The sauce was ok. Presentation was simple. Finally, the Chinese broccoli was properly prepared and simply served.

100 bucks for that meal. That just didn't add up....

So, ok food for outrageous prices."}
{"text":"Pretty basic Chinese food. Ok if you're in a hurry and want a quick meal. Do NOT order the hot tea unless you're willing to pay $4/person!! You won't find out until you get the bill..."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard about location location location when it comes down to have business? So this place is one of them.  The food tasted really bad, weird and old. I was so starving, but I could only ate not even half of what I ordered. The server never checked on me if I was doing OK,  even though I was by myself. Not recommended unless you have no choice and starving."}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is fast food Chinese. Food was not fresh and was previously prepared. Rice was dry."}
{"text":"$16.00 for a bowl of pho. you get about 5 or 6 pieces of beef which are very tough, and I think they use a a lot of MSG  in their soup. Service is OK."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some Asian food. Came here on a Sunday after visiting the shark reef. Got tired from walking and decided to give this place a try. The food was great. I love the wonton soup the most. Me and my friend both left satisfied."}
{"text":"I was here the first time last year's memorial weekend and I enjoyed it so much I went 2 days in a row. You can always tell when a place is good when it's busy with patrons and it was, especially full of Asian customers! ;) This time I came in with the intention of ordering the crispy duck noodle soup which was delish! I forgot to request flat rice noodles instead of egg noodles but it was great anyway as the duck was meaty and perfectly cooked. The soup was more than enough especially for lunch. We had a lady named lua (I think) service our table, she was very friendly and attentive, she was quite endearingly cute! A little pricy but the restaurant was clean and didn't look cheap at all, nicely decorated with plants, mirrors, artworks and soft colours used. The toilets are clean and spacious! Free wifi available too. Always a place to visit when I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Food & service are underwhelmingly blah. Seems like they should be in a run down strip mall instead of an elegant resort."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely friendly and accommodating. The food was sub par. We had the beef brisket soup that had a layer of fat oil lining the top. The beef broth was tasty but probably wasn't skimmed of the fat. We also had the chicken with vegetables. The sauce and chicken basically had zero flavor and was completely boring. Definitely a waste of money."}
{"text":"Eating at this restaurant compelled me to sign up for yelp. It is outrageously overpriced (even for Vegas) and the quality is lacking. We had a party of 8 and there wasn't anything being enjoyed. The Dim Sum platter for seemed to be microwaved as the dumplings were unevenly heated and lacked flavor. One guests Pho was thin and the meat was super fatty and tough. The shrimp in all the dishes was fishy and mushy. Service was poor for how empty the place was. My beer glass was also washed poorly and looked like the previous beers foam dried on the glass. 

P.S. 

I would like to know if anybody has ordered the $175 Birds nest soup."}
{"text":"I was pretty famished after landing in Vegas - so I need some lunch immediately. I wish I hadn't made the snap decision of eating here. Considering everything in Mandalay Bay is upscale - I thought this place would be good to eat.

Sorry, it isn't. I had a bowl of seafood soup. Let's talk about that. 

Soup Base: Tasted of Instant Replicated Add-hot water broth.
Seafood: Yay for reheated frozen shellfish
Vegetables: Just a few overcooked leaves of kai-lan?

I paid 15 bucks for reheated shellfish and instant soup? 
I won't be around for Round 2."}
{"text":"if you've ready any of these reviews, you already know this place is pricey so i won't harp on it (almost $16 for pho, are you kidding me?!). okay maybe a little.

but if they're going to rape and pillage our wallets, i suggest they at least try to make the food tasty. more to the point, have some taste/flavor. also, for a place called \"the noodle shop\" there was a disappointing choice of noodles. really? yes, really.

FOOD-
after getting my bowl of beef noodle soup, the soup looked pretty bland and there was a lot of oil floating on top. i gave it the benefit of the doubt as looks can be deceiving but after taking a sip of the soup, i knew that looks were right on. there was NO flavor to the broth. it was more like oily water with a tinge of beef. the beef pieces were also fatty and stringy with maybe two pieces of that were of any substance. 

my friends ordered two staple dishes: the pad thai (how can you go wrong with that?) and beef fried rice (how can you go wrong with this?). the pad thai did not taste like pad thai. i understand if you want it to be all fusion-y but should it not at least retain some of the flavor of what it claims to be? it was orange-colored like pad thai. didn't taste at all like pad thai. the fried rice was bland and needed chili paste to bring out some semblance of flavor. speaking of chili paste...

SERVICE -
we went at 9pm and there were maybe 4 other parties in the whole place. after we received our order, we didn't see the waiter again for half the meal as i ate slowly because i wanted to ask the waiter for some chili. eventually, i had to walk up to the hostess and ask her for it because we had no idea where our waiter was. a few minutes later, our waiter came briskly by our table without a word (no \"sorry for the wait\" or \"is there anything else you need?\"), plopped the chili down and kept walking. at least he didn't throw it.

sure, it's convenient, but it isn't worth that convenience. walk outside the strip and get some panda express if you're jonesing for asian food. it certainly beats this place in terms of taste and is cheaper.

p.s. - $2.50 per person for tea?! the casino's robbing you enough already. don't waste it on this joint."}
{"text":"We arrived late yesterday to our hotel, and looked for a place to sit and wind down. The noodle shop was suggested to eat and relax. First time ever here, food was OK but nothing more (duck/rice/dumpling) . Server was very quick and easy going.
Overpriced and quality could be better."}
{"text":"Food poisoning from the congee. I wish I had read reviews first. Avoid!"}
{"text":"I know that I live in Irvine, the MECCA of authentic and tasty Chinese food, so perhaps my superior and spoiled palate has a higher standard for Chinese cuisine, but COME ON REALLY!!!! How do you mess up Mongolian Beef? 

My boyfriend and I got the Mongolian Beef (more like The Sugah Beef) and Mabo Tofu (it was aiight). 

The beef was WAY too sweet! I was expecting a spicy and savory flavor sensation, but clearly the cook was thinking something else!

Definitely won't be going here again! $17.95 for sugary beef makes me a sour puss!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy over the top pricey for what looks like the 24 coffee shop in most hotels in Vegas. 

However, if you just want a dish, it soooo good. I had Singapore Noodles and shall crave them from California."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian spring rolls & grandfather chicken, mediocre service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were looking to carb-load the night before the marathon, so we took a vote, and noodles it was. It's this weird veneer of vegas flash over Chinese dive, you know, one of those places where there's a secret menu and the server wants to know if you can REALLY handle spicy. 
One of the gals tried to order the beef flank steak with noodle soup (essentially mi with tendon), and was immediately and strongly discouraged by the waiter.

The soups were the strong point -- broths were good, the wonton soup with a boatload of wontons and noodles is a Vegas steal at $10 for a huge bowl. The more generic dishes, like beef with broccoli, etc, were just gummy and salty and AWFUL."}
{"text":"Eh, not that great.  I definitely expected a lot more because of the location and price of the restaurant.  The service was not that great.  I actually had my bill slapped on my table as I was eating my lunch.  He expected me to pay too! but that wasn't really why I gave it 3 stars.  The food wasn't that good.  I tried the thai spicy noodles that costed me 15 bucks.  Ugh, just.. not that amazing.  Mediocre, poor service, and just bleh.  

I really liked the interior design though!"}
{"text":"If there was 0 stars, thats what the rating would be for this place. Horrible service, very rude waitress. I still havnt tried the food as I write this but at this point I can care less how the food tastes. Avoid this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 1 star because I can't give a 0. The service sucked, the front desk lady had the most rude tone of voice. Also the food is way too overpriced for its taste and quality. The 5 dollar bowl of hot and sour soup was the size of my palm and it wasn't spicy or sour, it was bland!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the Seaweed Salad 
It was ok it feels like it was missing something not 
SUre what 

And I went with the sweet  and sour chicken 
Now my friends I have to tell you , that was good it was flavor OVEr CHICKEN \" and I say that because most of the time wen I eat SS chicken oh Orange Chicken , is mostly breaded sugar .
 
Pascual was not my server , but he was on top of everything, water ,how was everything,do I need anything,ect... My actual waitress forgot about me , she only came by to bring my food and the check  ,, we need more customer service like Pascual ."}
{"text":"This was my first time @ The Noodle Shop, and to be honest, it sucked. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things, but doubt it. My friend and I ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce and the lo mein. Neither of them had any flavor whatsoever. The atmosphere, however, is super nice, and our waiter was AMAZING! I can't remember his name but he provided us with outstanding service. The prices at The Noodle Shop are not worth the bland flavored foods."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has gone downhill fast. It used to be my go to late night restaurant. Not any more.

Fried rice tasted stale, and the chicken tasted odd."}
{"text":"Went here last week with my girlfriend.  The waiter was nothing more than a skinny little rude SOB.. Acted like we were a bother and only checked up on us once. Good food, but bad experience.   We asked if they had wonton chips for the soup he freaked out and said \"No!!!!!\".  I guess we offended him or something lol, he reminded me of the waiter from booty call inside that restaurant where they skimp Bunz on a few shrimps and he complains."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place.  The soups are a must for a good hangover!  I'm giving it 4 Stars because of the Roasted Duck soup, and the service was friendly. 5 Stars are for the \"OH MY GOSH!\" places. While good, this wasn't one of those.

  I think the reason people aren't giving this place better reviews is because they are used to their hometown Chinese joint, which I get, and because it's Vegas and it's pricier than their hometown too! LOL.  We loved it!  It tastes like Sam Wo's in SF, CA! Which I LOVE!  My sister ate here as well with us, and we've literally been craving the place, and my sister is SUPER picky with food!  So, there is my opinion!  I love it."}
{"text":"Terrible service to say the least. Very rude staff. And if you think about ordering hot tea for your table be prepared to pay $5.00 per person."}
{"text":"We attended a late show in the Mandalay and opted to eat at the Noodle Shop afterward for dinner as it was closeby.  There were several tables occupied and we were promptly seated.  The service was slow.  The food was awful. The peanut sauce for the satay was tomato based (!), and the chicken was dried out, obviously cooked hours before.  The other two entrees were orange beef, gummy and off tasting - a clump of meat on a plate without any type of sauce or garnish, and beef and vegetable low mein (chopsuey/fried noodle) which was extremely greasy with the only 'vegetables' being a generous handful of onions.  Yep, only onions.  We were half through the meal before the hot tea arrived.
  I guess the most telling point was the waiter, who was fairly scarce,  NEVER asked how things were even when 90% of the food was uneaten.  My advice, go down to the food court and get Panda Express.  At least there the food would be fresh and half the price."}
{"text":"I went to get a quick bite to eat at noodles . I ordered the satay chicken $13 for 3.5 pcs .  The wait was around 20 minutes from the time I ordered . I order satay chicken all the time around Las Vegas and for 5pcs it is usually $7-$8 . The most important thing is this was the worst tasting satay chicken I have ever had . The service was fine ... The food was not good and was overpriced !"}
{"text":"We came here for we were staying at the Four Seasons.   The wonton noodle soup and pho were good but it was way over price.  We probably wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite to eat before we caught our flight.  For hunger purposes it served its need.  I've eating many Asian soups before and this one wasn't anything to brag about.  The shrimp wonton noodle soup was equal to ramen noodle with delicate dumplings. For the price just grab a bagel or something else if you are famished or go in the gift shop or better yet wait until you arrive at the airport."}
{"text":"SLOW SERVICE, and its expensive, which is fine if they could've at least made my food the way asked (extra spicy, extra garlic) instead it was the exact opposite. Did I mention how slow they were? 
It seriously took 10 minutes to see a waiter, we almost walked out. Then the drinks came after the food and the appetizer came with our entrees. Then while waiting on our change the woman decided to sit 2 couples then answer phones, maybe they are understaffed.  I finally had to get up and ask for my change before she continued to seat people!"}
{"text":"Needed soup after a three-hour drive from Utah with a sore throat. Noodles seemed like the perfect place. I got the Duck Noodle Soup and it hit the spot. It wasn't seasoned much, but a scoop of chili sauce helped clear my sinuses. 

My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which she wasn't impressed with. The smaller chicken pieces were almost entirely breading and were very hard. She wished she had ordered my lunch. 

The staff was polite, took our order, and brought our food out promptly. I did not have any issues with the service.

This place is pretty good, but you should make sure to order its namesake- NOODLES."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night after a conference. Honestly, I didn't have much expectation knowing this restaurant only has 2 stars on rating. However, my overall experience was beyond my expectation. We ordered the noodle soups and shrimp dumplings. The overall quality and quantity was probably a 4. The service was attentive, which was much better than some of the other restaurants in the Casinos."}
{"text":"Would not have tried this , but as I always am reminded in California Chinese mainlanders and first generations  like to gamble and eat ......Chinese food. I'm thinking there has to be some Chinese chefs back here in Vegas! Hell they changed the whole facade of the Lion's mouth entrance for the MGM Grand since many Chinese would not go there!!  (bad luck) Ok remember where you are..... listen to the staff. They are almost all from China or Hong Kong Cantonese speaking!  the place is called Noodles ! it will be overpriced and not as good as Monterey park or your last visit to a Hong Kong street corner. Do not order the Pho, the Thai food, and for that matter ....the Japanese udon! These are all different Asian countries ! Thats like going to a place called  \" EuroBeef \" ... having the same guy making Brats, Beef Wellington, and  Beef Bourguignon... Have what these guys make all the time... Chinese noodle soup and the congee.... again overpriced, but that seems to be the theme in this hotel!  I had the seafood won ton noodle soup.... with chilean seabass? Yes it was really seabass (i was skeptical at first) .... seems like a waste in the soup . Really it was not bad and was as tender and buttery as any Chilean seabass. I have been reading reviews about the service.....well i am not defending by any means, but have they been to Chinatown / Monterey Park at all??!!  I know it looks like PF Changs.... 
  Anyway my girlfriend had the Pho..... I warned her. It came with  Italian Basil like the kind you use on Caprese, and not the Thai/Asian  (her review will be 1 star! lol) The congee did look good too..."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever experienced in Vegas. I was looking for a moderately priced Asian restaurant on the south strip, and looking at the menu online beforehand, saw a lot of things that sounded good.  I should have known otherwise when we walked in and only 2 tables were occupied. Dining companion and I both ordered chicken dishes for the main course. She thought the chicken tasted rubbery, as did I. I usually associate this with undercooked meat. We both got very sick to the stomach about 2 hours later and these dishes were the likely culprit. We spent the remainder of our evening on the toilet back at the hotel room.

The only positives were that the server was attentive (because there were only like 7 customers at 6pm) and the Chicken Satay appetizer (which appeared to be cooked properly) was actually pretty good.

Don't go here. Even if you are trying to burn casino comps or something. Read the other reviews, we aren't making this stuff up."}
{"text":"We had the honey BBQ pork and roasted duck noodle soup and were very happy with both out dishes.  It came with Chinese Broccoli which was a plus.  The broth was flavorful for us - we drank the whole bowl.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed that website had number to call for reservations.... I called and NO reservations, but then no waiting..  Website also had kids menu, but got there and NO kids menu BUT server made up for it by honoring kids menu items anyhow.  Food was probably 3.5 out of five.  Staff and service was excellent and warrants the fourth star.  Price comparable to everything else around, higher than it should be."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend walked in right behind a different couple....they got served along with ice water offered....we sat there for over 15 min without anyone asking us if we wanted anything to drink.  The restaurant wasn't busy, maybe 6 tables total.  WTF
Finally received our water....straight up tap water where I can taste the treatment chemical...yuck.  WTF
The noodles soup came out very quick....alert...if you are asian...dont come here.  The soup is tasteless...yuck......one of the worst, if not the worst noodles soup ever.....and it cost $22 a bowl...WTF
I think they use the can soup to cook the broth because there is no way anyone can cook such bad broth.

To sum up...
Bad service
The worst food
Super expensive"}
{"text":"I dont know why everyone rates this place so bad, i thought it was pretty good, good enough to come here twice! Yea of course expect vegas prices, dont complain about the cost. I had beef noodle soup and added won tons for extra $4 that was such a bomb and hearty meal! Had my asian cravings satisfied, they are generous with the meat portions. Also ordered some dumplings that tasted great juicy inside and fresh. 2nd time around I ordered pork, seafood soup no noodles; it came with scallops, shrimp, bbq pork, won tons, squid, and some veggies. Filled me up! I would come here again if i stay in mandalay otherwise its a bit too far from the other hotels."}
{"text":"So so so so bad! The worst food I've had in Vegas. Such a shame for such a nice hotel. Do not eat here! Absolutely terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"1/5 stars
Located INSIDE Mandalay Bay. 
Service was good, but food was not. 

Booo..we were hungry, desperate, and thought this place would be a good idea. It definitely was NOT a good idea. Why?
1) Super salty
2) Expensive
3) Peking duck was HORRIBLE

Ordered:
1) Peking duck: 1/5 HIGHLY DO NOT recommend this dish. This was the worst dish on the table. It tasted like peking duck you would pick up at a fast food joint. 
2) Spicy garlic beef: 1/5 way, way salty
3) Beef Chow fun: 3/5 this was the only dish on the table that was edible."}
{"text":"Nothing more disappointing then getting bland Thai food. Should have checked the reviews first. The Thai iced is good, hard to screw up but the pad Thai has no flavor. They asked me if I wanted it spicy, said yes, no spice to be detected. Don't waste your money, much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"so disappointed.Checked in late and kids were hungry Thought I would take them to a nice dinner..We ordered orange chicken.it was gross and just some fried chicken with soy sauce.Told waiter we did not like and it was nothing like orange chicken we have had elsewhere.His response was that was how they do it.Chow Mein a little better but very average same with fried rice.As a previous reviewer said Panda Express would have been much better and not cost $55 for 3 dishes.A waste of money and a big disappointment!"}
{"text":"With all the good food around in Mandalay Bay, our expectations for Noodle Shop where high. Unfortunately, for the second time, we were disappointed. We tried it last year, and again this year. Their menu is varied and looks good. But the food we ordered was bland.  This time, we had Pho (Vietnamese Noodle Soup).  We eat lots of Pho in various cities, and this one just wasn't close. 

The only saving grace is they offer a shaved ice, with red beans and coconut milk. Yummy!! For this, we went back a couple times for dessert.  But other than this, we do not recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"Dreadful service. Boring food. Stupid prices.

On a relatively slow night, I was seated immediately, but it was fifteen minutes before a waiter came to my table and asked \"What do you want?\"

\"Well, a menu would probably be a good start.\" I replied.

He disappeared for another five minutes before dropping off a menu without a word.

Ten minutes later, same thing; \"What do you want?\"

I asked some questions about the food that were answered with only the barest minimum of information.

Service with a snarl seemed the order of the night.

I finally settled on the curried noodles and a cold sake. I should note here, that while I believe that there are several sake options, none other than cold/hot were offered to me, and there was no drink menu.

The dish was like a package of store-bought ramen noodles with just a hint  of curry flavor, but TONS of salt. It also had a few shrimp and some duck bits in it, which was fine for me - but was not mentioned on the menu. Vegetarians beware. 

Sadly, with such a salty dish, I never got a refill on my water, nor on my sake - as a matter of fact, the waiter never visited my table again until he brought the check. He never asked if I wanted anything else - desert, maybe - and I had to beg for another glass of water.

He then hovered over me while I figured out the bill (almost $40 for ramen and a glass of cheap sake).

Horrible, horrible, horrible.
...AND, I might add, Horrible.

Don't do it."}
{"text":"While the menu looks appealing, the food was quite disappointing. This is the first time that I have had orange chicken where the chicken was processed chicken--yes, that's right--chicken nuggets for $16.50. The local drive thru nuggets with sweet & sour sauce rivals this for a third the price!"}
{"text":"$28 for Wor Wonton soup? It wasn't that great, even for being hung over.

The manager was really nice, however and comped the bachelorette a mimosa."}
{"text":"This place was neither bad nor good. It is one of those places that tastes better as your hunger increases. The food is not bad nor is the value. I most certainly have had worse. Obviously this doesn't sound like a glowing thumbs up but in all honesty it is just \"ok.\" The service is marginal at best but if you find yourself with a growl in your stomach and you walk by this place you can rest assured that you will get a decent tasting meal. This place might fair better as a small local hole in the wall Asian restaurant but it is in a major Vegas hotel so the standards shift a little bit. I do not regret having lunch here but I wouldn't tell anyone to drop that hot hand at the tables to come for eats at the Noodle Shop. 

The wonton noodle soup was very basic, nothing fancy. It had a decent broth and I felt satisfied eating it, how much will I remember of it after....well that's another story."}
{"text":"Decent food, high prices and so-so service.

At a trade show, came here two days in a row and got the TOM YUM KUNG SEAFOOD AND RICE NOODLE SOUP.  This offering is described in their on-line menu as \"Vietnamese-Style Pho Soup with Beef\" - it is not.  It is Tom Yum with ramen noodles and a few carrots, snow peas and a couple shrimp.  It is good but not worth $17.99!"}
{"text":"I wanted pho and I didn't want to venture far from the hotel so when I saw this restaurant I thought I'd give it a try.

I was disappointed.

Service could have been friendlier.
$17 for pho was a slight shock considering I can get it for under $10 in So Cal, probably at a larger size.
The broth was flavorless, even with the added sauces. It just turned into a flavorless spicy broth.  The beef was a little chewy and they don't use Thai basil. 

I will say that the restaurant was clean and quiet and service was quick."}
{"text":"Beef- filet mignon w asparagus - meat was chewy and fatty not lean- steam rice was dry.  Very disappointed after spending $60 for 1 person."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 11 this weekend after a wedding, reception and a little bit of after partying.

Everyone got something different and there was a lot of sharing and tasting around the table.

Every single one of us was happy with our food, another reviewer said that they would rather go to Panda Express and that just blows my mind.  The food at Noodle Shop was really well prepared and perfectly seasoned when we were there!

Some of the standouts from the evening include the Pad Thai (both shrimp and chicken) the Pho (expensive for Pho but tasty!), the eggplant, the black bean chicken and a tofu dish.  The lettuce wraps were tasty but the ones at P.F Changs are better (and I hate PF Changs).

The place is a little pricey but it's a restaurant in a casino in Las Vegas.  I don't think they were priced more than any similar places we saw and the food was MUCH better than most casino/hotel cafes I've been to.

I will definitely hit up the Noodle Shop again when I am in Vegas next."}
{"text":"The house chow mein was amazing! The service was quick & friendly! I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Perfect cure for a cold, esp when you're stuck in the Vegas strip.

I'm not too sure why the reviews were so harsh. The service was great, food came out promptly, and the food was good. While the pricing is a bit high, consider that you're in Vegas and in the Mandalay Bay. 

 Roasted duck noodle soup cured my sinus prob.The flavors were great and the duck was amazing.It really helped bring out the duck flavor in the broth as well. I also ordered the seaweed salad. It was good except I wasnt fond of the mayo salad on the bootm.

Overall, not a bad place. Give it a shot if you're too lazy to head to chinatown for food."}
{"text":"The service was good, the food not so much. The noodles tasted like they were frozen then thawed out and microwaved. The potstickers were barely edible and not tasteful. Definitely not worth the exuberant price tag!!!"}
{"text":"Of course they're inside of mandalay bay hotel so we expected for high prices for their menus and we are not wrong on that... but service is fine, food taste as well... it is nice for asian food menu"}
{"text":"The only thing that's good here is the won ton noodles, i mean the texture of the noodles... Other than that everything else was NO BUENO! Our vietnamese coffee was watered down, and our duck was OLD! never again!"}
{"text":"Close this Place. 
Should have know it. Empty Restaurant on Thursday Night. 
Service was very very nice but the Food. Awfull. 
Pf. Chang & Panda Express have better Food than this Restaurant. 

The Dessert Menu was a joke 3 Things to choose. 

Skip this Place."}
{"text":"I got sick at this place the dish I got was all fat I will not return.  Service was ok I did not enjoy food at all."}
{"text":"Astoundingly bad. We had some sort of chicken dish - it had an overly sweet sauce with way too much soy sauce and only after I was half way through did I realize what was really wrong. The chicken pieces appeared to be the preformed chicken  nuggets you get from any fast food joint smothered in a disgusting sauce. You can get better from the freezer cabinet at Safeway.
Beef chow mein was tough, greasy and bland."}
{"text":"I had the duck soup.

Presentation was great, the duck was tasty (albeit very fatty), but I didn't like the noodles or broth. I was expecting something more Chinese but it tasted like pho with duck (I was not expecting Vietnamese soup).

I would not order the soup again.

My guest ordered dim sum and it was something like $12 for four shumai. That's insane.

Both of us agreed, we won't go back."}
{"text":"In simple words, the Panda Express across Las Vegas boulevard is better.  In fact, it makes Panda Express seem like PF Chang's.  The taste of the food is lacking and the cost is outrageous for what you are being served.  

I have been there in past years and it seemed good.  However recent experiences indicate to me that something  has changed in the kitchen.  The black bean chicken was bland.  The chicken lettuce wraps (a total of three) were chicken on a unfoldable leaf of romaine.  The sirloin with asparagus sauce was kind of funky."}
{"text":"This place is a good choice if you like Asian food. I had the chicken pad Thai noodles. There was a lot of noodles, enough to share if you wanted. The staff was friendly and the service was good. Would eat there again on a future trip."}
{"text":"Great concept: just had it better and cheaper elsewhere.  With that said, this is a soul satisfying place for soups.  I especially liked the thin noodles with duck and Chinese greens and Bok Choy.  The noodles were a little \"dry\" in the mouth-feel, but the duck was perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I've gone here for years simply because the annual event I attend is at Mandalay Bay and it's the only place that serves food past 9:00pm (which is another problem).

So this year, I'm sitting there with my friends like always, we've had too much to drink like always, and we go to the noodle shop to get some food in us before we go to bed like always.  And finally, after so many years, it dawned on me....this place sucks.

The food is very bland even if you add 15 spoonfuls of hot sauce.  The service is insanely slow even though you can clearly see the servers standing around, talking to eachother, and always exchanging lots of pieces of paper.  The paper exchange thing is lame and annoying and I realized, in my booze induced haze, that this noodle place has been this way every single year.  I'm serious when I say, it is consistently mediocre.  The table is never completely set, you always have to ask for hot sauce or soy sauce.  The whole damn place is using hot sauce and soy sauce but you still have to ask for it.  What's the deal with that?

Last but not least, the prices are absolutely insane.  $19 for a bowl of noodles?

I miss the good old days when every hotel casino had a 24 hour coffee shop where you could get good food for next to nothing.

Screw this place, I don't care how hungry I am, I'm never going here again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were in a hurry to eat before dashing off to a show, so we didn't bother to look at any reviews before crossing the threshold. Strategic error. 

Our party ordered, among other things, the pad thai and the duck. I had the pad thai, which literally consisted of over 50% grilled white onions. Seriously.  There were more onions than noodles.  The chicken was undercooked, and possibly a little raw.  My brother's duck was mostly bone and skin. All of this was way overpriced. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."}
{"text":"So on this trip to Vegas I decided I wanted to eat something else besides burgers, steaks, and buffet food. So I finally gave in and went for some overpriced Chinese food.  I came pretty late (like thirty minutes before closing..which I think was midnight), so I was seated very quickly.
  
  The atmosphere of the place is pretty cozy and chic, but without having that uber \"hey look we're a fusion restaurant\" look. The menu had a good amount of items that seemed pretty authentic. Anyway I ordered some Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, beef chow fun, and a roasted duck noodle soup. 

  Service throughout the night was very quick and friendly (even though the place was pretty much closing) and the servers constantly came by to check on me...which was nice. The food on the other hand...well I don't know what it was...but nothing was that hot...in temperature. As if everything was cooked, but sat out for five or ten minutes before they served it to me.  As for the quality, it was somewhere between what you'd get at a Chinese buffet and actually going to a restaurant in a decent Chinatown. As for prices...well it's Vegas so it's definitely higher than what you'd expect from a Chinatown place (i.e. Beef Chow Fun was like $15...where as in Chinatown would be closer to $8-10). But not going to make you go broke by any means.  I think my only major beef with the place was that my hot tea was luke warm...kind of annoying.

  Anyway The Noodle Shop is definitely not a place I would go out of my way for. But the food quality was good enough, the prices were fair, and the service was very good. If I was craving Chinese food and in the Mandalay Bay or near it...I wouldn't hesitate to stop in. 

~G"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  We had two dishes... Pad Thai, which was not that good.  Also Orange Beef, which was good but salty.  Next time I will try the Chinese place at the Wynn."}
{"text":"Oh my do these people deserve their 2.5 stars!

I have been going to this place for as long as I can remember, every time that my tradeshow pops up at Mandalay Bay. And it gets worse, and worse and finally - disaster!

First, I have to say that they have this incredibly amusing waitress who is any other Cantonese style Hong Kong restaurant, would be just as incomprehensible but alas...would only serve you great food, even if it was still moving when it arrived. Living in Hong Kong, I met plenty of ladies like this. And none would have ever remained in a job at such a terrible excuse of a Chinese restaurant. Even by Qwai Lo standards - this was a disaster.

We had a bunch of dishes. The fish was fishy in smell. The noodles - bland. The chicken tastes better in those free samples given out at shopping malls. 

It was honestly one of the worst places I have eaten food at - period.

The hotel gave me a 100 dollar gift certificate after we complained about our 45$ meal. They own the Noodle Shop and if they ever bother to read their reviews, it is a real wonder why they don't switch up the chefs/staff and management - fast!"}
{"text":"Not going to complain about the price as EVERYTHING is overpriced in the strip's hotels.  They have decent HK style food and we even ordered in Cantonese.  We had the flat rice noodles with beef and it was excellent.  The \"yee-meen\" noodles with veggies were alright."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of food at Noodle Shop - it was quite good!

We were staying at the Mandalay Bay and we've walked right by it for years, but never bothered to try it.   Well now we have and I can say that I would definitely go back if given the chance.

The Orange peel chicken was soooo good - I am still thinking about it.  The flavor was delicious - and though it was fried, it was not battered so it was not greasy at all.  But the flavor - truly delicious.  

Hubby had the noodles with shrimp and xo sauce - which was very expensive for what it was - but still quite tasty.  

Service was eager and attentive.  Price overall was expensive for Chinese food.  But if  you're staying at Mandalay Bay - this is a solid choice for a bite."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch after seeing the Bodies exhibit at the Luxor.  Fusia was closed (my first idea), and I didn't really feel like doing the bus transfer thing all the way out to Chinatown.   That doesn't mean I didn't want Chinese food.  This is where I ended up.

The selection was okay, the food wasn't bad, but wasn't good (certainly not as good as what I could have gotten in Chinatown), and the prices were somewhat inflated (which I expected in a casino)."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a nice meal here before going to see Michael Jackson's ONE.  I ordered the seafood won ton soup and was pleasantly surprised with the amount of seafood.  The soup had shrimp won tons, sea bass, shrimp and scallops.  Soup broth was a bit bland, but I just added chili sauce to kick it up a bit.  My wife had the BBQ Pork Noodle Soup, which contained a lot of BBQ Pork.  She enjoyed her meal and the service was good as well."}
{"text":"Oh dear this place is just bad.  The meat is bad, the noodles are bad, and the soup is completely terrible.  And it's super pricey.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   Ok , the food is straight up average , BUT .. I like that the staff is Asian and they're honest with suggestions.  I've eaten here at least 10 times now.  It's been consistent over the years.   If you're looking for the best of the best , this isn't the place.  If however you're looking for decent consistent Asian noodles then this is a great place.  

My favorite is the chow fun and house special fried rice.   The Pho is VERY American so if you're looking to re-live that trip to Vietnam it's not gonna be for you.... But I still like it in a hurry.  Honestly it's probably only on the menu as a stop gap for traveler who only know Pho from some American back home spot. 

Bottom line ...
It's clean , fast , honest , and priced accordingly for where its at.  

It's my go to spot for quick lunch and light dinner when I'm at The Mandalay.  

Enjoy."}
{"text":"We stopped by The Noodle Shop before seeing the Lion King. I had the crazy idea that the larger casinos' restaurants would at least be \"decent\", so I didn't check Yelp beforehand. I should have known better!

My boyfriend ordered pho and I ordered vegetable pad Thai. We split the seaweed salad as an appetizer. The seaweed was good but the added tofu was unnecessary. Overall though, pretty good. Since there aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, I asked if the pad Thai could be made with vegetables instead of meat. She said that wouldn't be a problem. 

Our dishes came and I was disappointed to see that my entree consisted of nothing more than orange, oily noodles and a few pieces of onion. That's it. No extra veggies, peanut crumbles or fresh bean sprouts. I'm sure it would have been acceptable for some hungover frat boy, but I expected a little more. It lacked the taste and texture that's pretty standard at even the worst Thai restaurants. My boyfriend compared his soup to \"mall pho\" and it was missing the traditional condiments. 

Overall, this place definitely wasn't worth the price and I recommend skipping it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got so many bad reviews. I went in knowing it might be a complete clusterfugg but was pleasantly surprised. Quick service although I really think the waiter we had was acting out the Chinese role. He had on fake black glasses which i could tell has no prescription on them and he sounded and acted like Mr. Chow from the hangover. 

Regardless, I had the kung pow chicken dish which came with white rice. It was a large portion and very tasty with a perfect heat level. People complain about the prices but for $19 I thought it was normal.. Were in vegas people.. Everything will be a few dollars more than non vegas prices.

I like that they didn't try to force the sale of expensive alcohol like most restaurants around. 

All in all I thought the noodle shop delivered exactly how it should have. Well done!"}
{"text":"I know this place has pretty bad reviews, but I was at a conference and dammit, I wanted Asian food. It's actually a nice little interior, and the service is just fine. I ordered some pork fried rice for $15 and it was a pretty large serving. I was afraid to try $22 pho, but I'll do fried rice. It was also one of the cheapest things on the menu, but the resort restaurants are pretty expensive all around. Even a sandwich at Starbucks will run you like $8. 

It's nothing to write home about, but if you don't have time to run elsewhere, it's not so bad."}
{"text":"Ooooohhh emmmmmm geeee. Horrible. Horrible. Panda Express is better than this. And that's a chain restaurant. 
We ordered the house special fried rice. Nothing special. Orange chicken. More like battered chicken in oil. Steamed/seared shrimp dumplings. More like fried/burned dumplings. Please do not waste your money here or appetite."}
{"text":"Only stop by for a quick lunch. Order Yang Chow Fried Rice and Wonton Noodle. 100 points. Almost same as Hong Kong....."}
{"text":"Was expecting terrible food from reading other reviews.  We had lunch here just before leaving Vegas and were pleasantly surprised.  Everything had good flavor and was well cooked.  We got our food in timely fashion and the waiter was prompt to refill our drinks and ask if we needed anything else.  This is a great place for a quick and yummy lunch!"}
{"text":"I do hope people read this before they eat here. I agree with the previous review. The service is slow and disorganized. The food is waaaaaay overpriced for the portion and quality. We ordered Singaporean noodles and what we had seem like it came from Iraq or anywhere else except Singapore. The food here is just horrible. You're the better off getting a meal at the deli next to the sports book area. One more thing, our bill came out immediately after our dishes, literally. Just the type of service you expect from a place in a 5-star resort charging $18 entrees right?"}
{"text":"Food was weird. Not a typical Chinese restaurant, really bright lighting. The pad Thai was bland and tasted like uncooked fish. The hot and sour soup looked like it had already been digested and regurgitated. Would not come back."}
{"text":"The food has great flavor. My friend got the Pho soup and I got the Pad Thai. Both were made so well, tasted amazing. Huge plate of food, I didn't think I'd finish it, but I did! Every last bite. The manager was such a genuinely happy, funny, friendly and engaging man. We went here after watching the Michael Jackson ONE show which was amazing and the perfect food to follow watching great entertainment. I'd come here again next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Traveling for work this week at the awesome city of Las Vegas, NV.  I had a little time in between meetings and venture out side of the food courts of Mandalay Convention Center and stumbled onto a cute Asian noodle restaurant called the Noodle Shop.

It was around noon and they had plenty of booths and tables.  The ambience was quite pleasant and reminded me of some of the Asian restaurants in Hong Kong.

We got seated right away but it took 10 minutes for the server to come back and take Drink and food orders.  Finally, the server came back and we ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and the Beef noodle soup.

I splurged on an extra $3.00 up charge for the request of vegetables.  The soup was ok but not great for $20.00 of broth, pork belly, Raman noodles, and vegetable.

The broth was super greasy and was not as flavourful and I was hoping for.  The vegetables was a great selection.  The pork belly had zero flavours and a lot of fat.

I do not recommend getting the soup based on minimal flavours and a lot grease.  I am sure there were other amazing dishes that they could have executed better on but the noodle soup was not one them based on the name of the restaurant.

It took a good 15 minutes for the server to come back and give us our checks.

Based on the cost and the quality of food I do not recommend this place for a business lunch at the Mandalay Bay selection of restaurants.

Ambience was good and got me excited about the potential taste of the food.  Once the food arrived it did not spark my tastebuds.  The service was very slow despite the lack of customers in the restaurant.  

I would like to try this place again in the near future in hopes that the chef would create a more delightful savoury Asian noodle bowl that resonates with the traditional cuisine of Asia.  

They should change the name to something that would better meets the expectations of the food because noodle soup by far was not their expertise."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner. None of the food was that great just eh. Had chicken lettuce wraps and the house chow mein. I've had better chow mein from Panda Express. They didn't skimp on the meat in the chow mein, but overall bland and just boring. Service didn't redeem anything. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best. The food was pricey for the quality. The most annoying thing was that we wouldn't understand a word our server was saying. We constantly had to correct her because she was getting everything wrong. If they want to give their Chinese place an authentic feel, that is fine, but hire people who speak English. It made such an unpleasant lunch to have to do sign language and correct the server because of the language barrier. 

The positive: The food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"Food was good but their serivce was terrible! Our waitress was very rude and it was extremely difficult to get her attention."}
{"text":"Called for the House Special Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp and the BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Both sucked. I could feel the crunch of MSG on both. BBQ pork had no flavor (zero). House Special Fried Rice was nothing but normal fried rice with chicken and shrimp. Nothing great about the ambience. Go only if you are craving for low grade asian food."}
{"text":"EW.....was walking through Mandalay Bay with my BF on our last day in Vegas and saw this place and got really excited. We were both a little hungover and some chow mein and fried rice sounded perfect. 

I SO wish I had checked YELP before dining here. Service was horrible...we were seated right after a couple who looked wasted but were given a great booth and we were given a table in the middle of the dining area...um no

Me: \"Can we PLEASE be moved to a booth?\" 

Hostess: \"Oh, hmmm..okaayyy...is this better for you\" gave us a nice big booth with some big attitude to boot. 

Me: \"Yes actually this is PERFECT\"

Server was quick, too quick for not being crowded at all. As if she didn't care and just didnt want to talk to us at all. They also forgot my drink, which just irked me in my hungover state. 

To the food: the Spring Rolls came out about 10 mins after we ordered them and they were mildly warm. To me this equals: They are premade and left out and then poorly reheated...ew. 

I got chicken chow mein...greasy, slimy, gross. 
My BF got pork fried rice...I dont like pork and this pork looked totally uncooked and the rice was not \"fried\" and barely had any veggies. 

Our server never came back to ask us if we wanted water and since there was so much sodium in the food we were dying for water. Had to practically yell at her across the room because she was darting about and talking with the other servers. 

Bill was about $60 which is fine since we were in Vegas, but NOT for 
the quality of the food or the service."}
{"text":"NOT RECOMMENDED. Horrible ! 
How can Mandalay Bay Resort allow a 0* restaurantt to exist in their 5* resort.
Menu looked good especially Laksa.  LAKSA ON MENU IS NOT SERVED. Had I bothered to yelp, I wouldn't have stayed. 
I ordered vegetarian:
*Bok Choy came in flour garlic paste.
*Veg thai curry was neither red curry nor green curry - white water diluted coconut milk thrown into a bowl of vegies."}
{"text":"When it comes to Asian food I'm very spoiled living in the Bay Area. The crispy, salt and pepper calamari, wasn't. The roasted duck noodle soup was actually pretty good. The service was ok."}
{"text":"The food was good-Ish but definitely overpriced for the quantity and quality. I came here for the convenience since we stay at the hotel but there are definitely abundant of better choices else where."}
{"text":"For some reason I didn't read the reviews before I came here. But they're right, 2 stars is even a little generous. 
I had the $19 duck appetizer. Now I love crispy duck and could eat it all day, but the skin was soggy and slimy and there were bones everywhere. Then I had the Singapore seafood noodles. I got 2 shrimp, 2 scallops and 1 piece of white fish. Expected more for $26. 

With so many other options in Vegas, it's safe to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I love this place!  Tasty dishes for a great price!  You definitely get your money's worth.  And the employees there are so cute and nice!"}
{"text":"This review in no way reflects Mandalay Bay. But wow,  this restaurant is bad,  very bad. The chicken chow mein had much too much onion and very greasy, worse than the worse Chinese fast food and the chicken was dry. 
We also ordered wonton soup. It was okay. Now,  soup should be steaming hot,  this wasn't,  and the wonton wraps were hard.  I asked for a different hotter bowl. The server microwaved it,  instead of heating the broth and new noodles. It came back with a horid smell. How can you serve that? !?!?
Drive 3 miles to China town and have some quality decent Asian foods."}
{"text":"Average Chinese food, certainly not fusion.  Spring rolls boring and greasy, as was veggie chow mein boring.  Broccoli in oyster sauce was good and a good price"}
{"text":"Sorry, wanted to like it but just can't. We've been here every year for the last 3 years at least. This past month will have been our last visit. The Mongolian beef was expensive, small, and mushy. It was nothing like I'd even expect from our local takeout place. It was more disappointing since we had phenomenal Mongolian beef from Monte Carlo the day before, for cheaper! The only thing that has been decent is their noodle soups but even those are fair at best.

Oh and the worst part was watching them \"clean\" the dirty tables. After a party left, a woman came to clean off the table. She used one of thief USED a water cups, dumped it on the table and wiped it down with a rag....umm that is NOT cleaning!"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat EVER, are you joking, 18 bucks for fried rice and it taste like microwave food, the worst place ever. Its in mandalay bay and at lease they should hire an asian cook cuz I think they hire a white guy to cook asian food a triple thumbs down! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THERE"}
{"text":"I was craving some Asian food and Noodle Shop was the closest thing to me without having to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain also known as Chinatown..... little did I know at the time, the 15 minute drive would have probably been worth it.

Albeit being on the strip, I understand that pricing is going to be a little more \"premium\", however... the dim sum came out to around $30 and was supposed to feed two people. I could've honestly finished it on my own and still be hungry.

For $30, you can get much value else where especially if you head over to the restaurants on Spring Mountain if you are ever craving Asian cuisine.

To add on to my experience... the soups just aren't worth it either. The service was quick and the server was friendly.... food was just underwhelming especially for the price it was listed at. I would expect more quality being at a nice hotel like Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"My husband and I are foodies and enjoy trying new restaurants. This experience started with a martini that was watered down with vegas tap water. He sent it back because he couldn't drink it (he has never met a drink he didn't like, btw). We decided to go with the appetizer menu and ordered the calimari and dim sum sampler. The calimari came out first. It was under seasoned and under cooked. We wanted to send it back, but were afraid after already sending back a drink. The dim sum platter came and it looked decent. It was alright until we got to the shumai. This is my husband's favorite. It tasted like a barn animal's a**hole. My husband actually spit it out. And we refer to him as the human garbage disposal. I have never seen him spit food out. Ever. Additionally, their spicy mustard was watery. My husband asked our waiter if it was watered down. The waiter admitted it was and said it was because they made it with powdered mustard. Our final bill was $79 which included a diet Pepsi and two drinks."}
{"text":"Not as bad as 2 stars, but not great either.  I'd say it is passable.  Everything is just ok, not great, but not bad either."}
{"text":"SO awful! This is one of those moments where I'm extremely disappointed in myself for not yelping some places before I go to them. I assumed that this restaurant being in a well known well liked hotel that it was equally well liked. WRONG! 

It took a solid 15-20 mins for our server to greet us for the first time. If it wasn't for being hungover in Vegas and not wanting to move we would've left and had lunch somewhere else. My friend and I ordered Pad Thai, Chow Mein and Veggie Egg Rolls. I honestly could have had better if I just order Chinese take-out. The food was like cardboard, flavorless and unappetizing. 

But enough about the food, it was the service that threw us over the edge. Not only did it take 15-20 mins for the server to greet us but after he brought us our food we never saw him again! We literally had to get up from our table at one point and search to pay our bill! I can't even remember if that's ever happened to me before. Overall it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had....ever."}
{"text":"Appetizer was ok, I got one of the dumplings they had on the menu.

I had a shrimp entree that was decent, I think it was the szechuan shrimp.

But I also tried the Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles and Seafood. It was the worst dish I've ever had at a chinese restaurant. We couldn't eat it. Just don't order that and maybe you'll be ok. Like I said, the szechuan shrimp was ok."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last month and honestly, you have to judge it for what it is folks! You're in a casino in Las Vegas. Obviously, it's not going to be the most authentic spot on earth, and obviously, prices are going to be 3 times what they'd be anywhere else. Does it do the trick? Totally! And is it still a lot more affordable than other Vegas options? Totally! I had the pho with white chicken meat and was more than happy with my option. My friend had a chicken dish and liked it as well. Looking for something a little less pricey in Mandalay, especially good comfort food, this will do the job."}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food.

+ Located inside our hotel so it was convenient.

- Small portions
- Somewhat expensive
- Small portions
- Small portions
- Small portions
- And last but not least, SMALL PORTIONS! 

The one plate per person rule doesn't apply here.  Two or three plates per person would be more fit.  

In Vegas, restaurants should have one of two things: 
1) Great food  
2) All- you-can
This place has neither.

I think the food would've tasted a whole lot better AFTER the Halloween party..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time dining here-mediocre food at best with sloppy plating and presentation. Shrimp pad thai was tons of bland noodles, a few tail on shrimp, and some onion with the option to add peanuts and squeeze lime on top. All the limes in the world wouldn't have helped this flavorless dish. Very pricey for quality and value. Be sure you don't expect to try dessert-the check was presented with no question of any dessert or drinks-and when we queried the waitress-we were told they don't have dessert? Drinks, appetizers, entrees, rice, noodles, but no Dessert? Just plain weird."}
{"text":"Wow, this was probably the worst $75 dinner we've ever had. We started with shrimp dumplings which didn't come until after the main course. Which both main courses were disappointing. The orange beef was soggy and gelatinous. The other was mostly onions. Both were those cheap cuts of meat you find at Chinese buffets. Hey but the iced tea was good. But at $5 each it was extreme. The bus boy was very attentive, although the waiter was not. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was really bad. Wanted to get a quick bite before a show and they atmosphere, waitresses, and food was terrible. I had shrimp and vegetables which tastes like it was in water instead of a garlic sauce and my husband had a chicken, beef, shrimp dish in brown sauce which was also terrible. Food came out in ten seconds suggestive its not fresh and the bill was brought before I was done eating. No good drink specials."}
{"text":"Biggest mistake that I made on my recent visit to Vegas was not checking Yelp on this restaurant.

As most reviewers have noted the food is not good and it is way overpriced.

Lowlight of our meal.... My daughter order the BBQ pork noodle soup.  It was horrendous; it smelt and tasted like a bad fish market.

Find any other restaurant.  Don't waste your time or your taste buds."}
{"text":"I had the seafood pho. When I first tasted the soup, it was not good. Pho is all about the broth. I put hot sauce so I can fool my taste buds. After I was done eating, I walked out and headed to the bathroom. My stomach and my body was boycotting. I threw up every ounce. Felt much better but was still left with bad taste in my mouth. Do not get the seafood pho. Nasty."}
{"text":"Just ok, I started with the pork soup and had yang chow rice. All ok, nothing special at all. It is cheaper than some other spots and has a decent wine selection. 

The service is quick and aloof as you might expect. No love when I went so that's a plus. Might go again for take out."}
{"text":"Customer service was great but the food was a let down. It was our first full meal of our day and the last meal of our stay in Vegas and we were excited to try new things and so far were beyond pleased. After we left we yelpled it to see that it was not a 4 star restaurant like the rest but a 2 Star. I would have to agree with that. It's a beautiful restaurant but beyond aesthetics nothing there."}
{"text":"Seriously terrible and disappointing. $30+ for some lame shit tossed in soy sauce. Service is bad. Porridge is okay but the meat in it is terrible. 

If you're Asian and have any idea what authentic Asian food tastes like, then you won't like it here. If you think Panda Express = good Chinese food, then you might have a chance. 

It's Panda-level, maybe even below...sometimes Panda is good.  Do yourself a favor and keep walking when you see the menu sitting outside. I walked by it 3 times and finally gave in. Biggest mistake of my life this week. 

I didn't give it a 1 star because I save that honor for places that I truly hate. This place is just truly disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here while we were waiting for our door lock to be fixed by the locksmith. I ordered Pad Thai with chicken and thought it was good. I also ordered Thai tea which was also good. Service was good as well. I would come back if we stayed in the hotel again."}
{"text":"Extrememly fast service which is great when you need a quick lunch while at the pool.  Har gaw dumplings were great as was the seaweed salad. Soup was huge and more than enough for 2, so when they tell you it's small, don't believe them!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some delicious pho, this is your place. I have been there once. My fiancé and I were craving something healthy and we split a beef pho and a seaweed salad. I must admit the seaweed salad was weird. I had a very strong, almost putrid aftertaste but I highly recommend the pho. It was probably the best pho I've ever had. The broth is amazing and they give you all of the sides. If you are craving something healthy and you don't mind the atmosphere I would definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere is kind of dull and boring but the soup is amazing. Did I mention that? Also, the service was outstanding. We had the sweetest, most helpful gentleman serving us. I stay at Mandalay Bay a lot and I always wanted to try this place. Its pho-king yummy!"}
{"text":"I did not expect this to be so good! I read these reviews and went anyway since I had a restaurant.com coupon. We ordered the seabass and pad thai and I loved them both. I wasn't' exactly stuffed as the portions aren't huge but it was as yummy as could be. Surprise for me! I have to assume with so many poor reviews on this place that it depends what you order. No idea how this food was rated poorly. It was delish!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly and the waiters are nice.  We went here twice.  The first time we thought it was very expensive.  Do not order the prawns!  They're not prawns..  They're just shrimp and they added the title \"prawns\" to them so they can charge you $26 for 9 shrimps bedded with salad.  It's pretty expensive here so you're better off getting comp from the casino to eat.  That's what we did the second time and it was okay.  
The food is \"not\" bad nor is it spectacular.  The best plate there is probably the Shrimp/Pork Dumpling for Appetizer.  It's only 6 bucks and I would order 3 of those with a few drinks and call it.  If you want tea then they'll charge you $2.50 for a cup.  This is the only place I have ever been to that charges you tea.  LOL.  This place is still surviving because it's the only Asian Restaurant you'll find that caters to Asian people in Mandalay Bay.  I can't hate it...  I just hate the prices!"}
{"text":"Food are definitely edible, but I just wouldn't come back again because for the price and yes, I understand that it is a restaurant that has to pay hefty in rent to be in the Mandalay Bay, the quality just wasn't up to par. My standard wasn't like sky high or anything, I just think I've received better Asian food because Noodle Shop may somewhat be confused of what it is. It's mainly all Chinese food and then you have random dishes from other Asian ethnicity like Pad Thai or Pho so maybe a non Asian person can come in and not see any difference in taste or care much, but for us Asians we are somewhat critically with the food we grew up with.  

The atmosphere looks and feels nice, it was in a clean environment so that was a plus, but the end results all comes down to the actual product that it delivers and Noodle Shop did not delivered good food to me."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst pho I've ever had in my life. I could put together a better dish cooking while drunk (thats pretty bad). I came here other day and the gentleman serving us was very accommodating. Tried the bbq combination platter, not much to say other than it was decent. My lady got the pho; she said it was terrible. I wanted to give the place a benefit of doubt since the food is of her native country. Maybe she was being a little harsh. 

Gave it a try today since i had quite an alcohol-filled night, pho if you dont already know is the cure to everything. Wish i could say the service experience was the same as the other day. 

Sat down for quite a while until a gent stopped by to see if i wanted anything to drink. This guy wasnt even my waiter, though i would have preferred him to be honestly. He took my drink order and chased down the guy who is supposed to be my waiter. I asked for fiji water because the vegas tap water tastes a little funny. Sure enough he brought out tap water. The gent from earlier saw this and kindly took it away apologizing for my waiter. Fiji arrives with a wet glass inside and out. It looked like the waiter dumped the cup and reused it, not caring to dry off any residue. 

In short, stay away from the pho. Service is hit or miss. And i just got the bill without a pen."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was craving some soup after I saw their advertisement in the Mandalay Bay in house dining section.. I really didn't care for the chicken wraps as much. I think pf changs has better ones in my opinion. I ordered their pho w/ chicken instead of beef. I have to say it was one of the best I've ever tried... I am super picky about my pho. It's so good, that I might go again tonight!"}
{"text":"Nothing else was open at Mandalay Bay at 12am (even the Raffles Café).  It was exactly what I expected.  I just wanted soup but they were out of the only thing I wanted (hot and sour soup).  
What to expect?  Overpriced Asian food.

Tried the Pad Thai - wasn't horrible but I've had better at Fast Food Thai Places that is quarter the price"}
{"text":"Great service.  Poor food at an exorbitant price!!  I would not return.   I am from a small town and have waited a long time to try Dim Sum.  It was extremely small for the price and very low quality of food.  I will try azgasin somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a quick meal here as it was 2pm and all we had to eat so far that day was Fat Tuesday's frozen daiquiris (yes, with the extra shot). I wasn't about to repeat my L'Atlier experience from last year. I needed something in my stomach before dining at Sage, stat! My friend ordered the beef satay and I got the Hong Kong won ton noodle soup. I've had better, but for under $12 it hit the spot. The broth lacked any of the subtle nuances that you can get with ramen broth, but the won tons had generous amounts of shrimp (and not much else). My friend thought her beef satay was way too sweet. Service was well, true to what I call \"Asian restaurant service\"--they bring you your food and leave you alone. I rarely tip 15% nowadays but here is where it may be justified. The reason why this place exists is because Vegas attracts a lot of Asian gamblers and if they're like my parents, they would prefer to eat Asian food. Heed my advice and do not eat here if given the choice. A better meal awaits you somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place 0 stars. Not good. Ordered chicken fried rice and the shumai. The fried rice was ok. Was a little sweet so wasn't my favorite. The shumai took a while to come out and when it did they did not smell good at all. Honestly they kind of smelled like canned pet food. I chose not to even try them, but my boyfriend took a bite and said they tasted worse than they smelled."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on Sunday hoping to get a bite of some hot soup (great after a night of drinking) before our flight  - we had one hour to kill before we head to the airport for our flight -
after being seated, we waited around for liek 10 minutes and hadn't even been served water yet!!!!! so we figured service was going to be suuuuuper slow
Add that to the prices (16 bux for a bowl of pho! 12 for a bowl of wonton soup!), we just got up and left
the service was so bad, they didn't even notice we were there in the first place"}
{"text":"From an asian yeah this place is terrible. Me and my friends got three things...all horrible"}
{"text":"We went because our kids love Chinese food. We ordered the lettuce wraps which were the most edible thing we ordered. I didn't know Chinese used pine nuts in their dishes.  We immediately turned away the seafood tom yum kung soup which was absolutely horrendous....cold and they didn't have a ladle....the broth tasted like old seafood and they used ramen noodles that resembled top raman.....we replaced the soup with kung pao chicken.....the only good thing about the dish was the roasted peanuts....they used chili paste, not whole Chiles. They was no pao to this chicken.   I'd noodle past the noodle house and go to PF Changs down the street."}
{"text":"Noodle BARF!  I was super hungry and drunk.  Even so I could tell this was the worst place I've ever eaten. How hard it is screw up ramen. It's all in the broth. Staff was even apologetic.  Do your research.  Not hard to fix!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. This place is overpriced cheap terrible tasting Asian food. Panda Express is much better than this. I've never had worse asain food. The orange chicken was cold, was processed chicken and tasted worse than McDonald's chicken nuggets. Please fire the cooks! How could you have a place like this that gets terrible reviews and not make a change in the food?? My table also had other dishes and nobody liked their food. Even my lemonade tasted like water! How do you mess up lemonade?? $100 later and not happy!"}
{"text":"Worst place. You could get any corner of any city better Chinese food than this place. 
It used to be a great restaurant. I wonder what happened.
It's located inside Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Mandalay Bay and were looking for something open on a Friday at 10:45.  I am on a gym challenge and really just wanted a salad or anything \"clean.\"  I had my own chicken in the room. 
Noodle Shop was still seating. The waiter assured me that the stir fry veggies would be mostly steamed.  I asked him for seasoned chicken to be added, but not oil or caloric sauces.  Our food arrived in less than five minutes.  My food was drenched in a brown sauce, but the chicken tasted very blah as if no seasonings were added.  My husband said his Kung Pao Chicken tasted Americanized.  It looked like the same sauce that I had, but thicker.   I also had a medium length black hair in my food.  We didn't complain at the time, unfortunately, but it was a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Too overpriced, definitely do not recommend coming here. Our waiter was a lady who wasn't welcoming at all whatsoever. Although, the manager whose tall and slim was efficient in checking in on our table to see how we are doing rather than our actual waiter who gave attitude and slow service. I also wasn't impressed with the quality of the food. I guess I had high expectations due to their prices.  Definitely not worth it. Very clean and fancy restaurant though."}
{"text":"The Noodle Shop was good.

I know most Asian places in Las Vegas, on the strip in the hotels (not including Panda Express types) tend to be expensive, in the realm of 2x - 3x the price you'd find at Chinatown, with maybe some Asian naysayers touting the possible whitewashing and lack of authenticity of some Chinese restaurants.

Let me tell you 'tho... I've tried most of the overpriced Chinese restaurants in the high end hotels, and I've never had a bad meal.  Sure, there is a bit of sticker shock when you see the menu and get the bill, but the food is indeed delicious and good most of the time.

So, with that I do give 'em the * * * A-OK rating, which I would say I'd come back again and also would refer others to try."}
{"text":"This was the place to stop by after that late or tweener flight into vegas.  It was nice to go somewhere casual after getting in, have a bowl of noodles.  Yes.... it was a bit expensive, but for \"strip\" eating, its about par.... par meaning about 40% high, but with good service to match."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awful. Then Pho is disgusting and the dumplings or Shumai gave one of my team members food poisoning. Literally some of the worst (and overpriced) food in Vegas. Stay far, far away."}
{"text":"I use to count on this place for a good bowl of pho or BBQ pork soup. But times have changed. 
Our party of three had both of the above, orange chicken, spring rolls and scallion pancakes and NONE of it was edible.
Pho-looked like gray dirty dish water
and tasted same. 
BBQ Pork Soup- Not sure how they accomplished this but the pork was bone dry even in the soup. 
Spring rolls-way too greasy. 
Orange Chicken-see Spring rolls. 
Scallion Pancake-See Spring Rolls. 
Wake up Mandalay and hold your restaurants accountable to have a little pride in what they serve."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. My family and I had dinner here and we got huge portions everyone shared their food! It was great! Servers and waiter were super sweet. The food came out fast. I would definitely recommend this place. Try their beef chow fun it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Very good hong kong style food. I don't know why it's only a two star but as a chinese person, the food is authentic. Smaller portion than I expected but all food is overpriced on the strip. Waited super nice too."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch - long wait, restaraunt slow to clear tables, to the point where one member of our party who was in restaraunt management boldly walked in and started bussing tables!  They got the point.

People who complain about the language barrier outta just get over their egos and learn from the experience.  Be patient, speak slowly, listen attentively.  

High prices.  Ok food.  I had the seafood tom kha, which was loaded with squid and shrimp and noodles.  Broth just ok,  i expected a lot more flavor.  We ordered a calamari appetizer that was below par.

Large parties are charged 18% gratuity, which we were not informed of and created quite the headache afterward.

Two star due to value. $100 for 4 bowls of soup and an appetizer.  Take a cab to ChinaTown, better food and you'll save money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I have no clue what everyone was talking about my priest blessed the food"}
{"text":"Give me a break.
Come on Mandalay! Take a hard look and tell me this place is in any way decent?
From the empty seats (should be your first clue), to the criminally bad dishes, it's amazing this place still stands. Rip the whole thing out and drop in something worthy. Please.

This last attempt was my second try. Shame on me.

Order the Pad Thai with chicken and see what it looks, smells and tastes like. Oh, and it's $18."}
{"text":"There aren't that many places open for lunch at Mandalay, so I was surprised that this place wasn't more crowded.  There is nothing special about this place, but just a quick place to drop in and get something to eat.  The orange chicken was decent, but nothing worth coming back for."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but worth it.  This is my second favorite place to eat at Mandalay.  It definitely hits the spot when craving a good noodle bowl with quality ingredients.  The proteins are not grisly like a lot of noodle restaurants.  The service always seems to be a little slow, but you really can't go wrong here.  Try it!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst food ever. We ordered Pho and it was bland. Even putting the sriracha and hoisin sauce was still nasty. Guess how much they charge for a bowl!? 18 bucks! Seriously? Here in Oakland it's 7-8 bucks and it's delicious. Now I understand why it's expensive cuz its a hotel rest. but damn at-least make ur pho better..We also ordered pad Thai and it wasn't good. If you want to get pho go to Chinatown in Vegas it's way better and cheaper. It's not that far. Customer service sucks at this place too. Came here cuz we were in a rush. We didn't want the Pacquiao bus leaving us to go to LA."}
{"text":"Very much over-priced place. They charge something like $15 for 4 shrimp dumplings. Shocked."}
{"text":"Being of Asian descent, I always look for a place that serve a hot long noodle soup.  This place inside the Mandalay Bay Casino has such a dish.  Certainly there are better places for that like in Venetian or Bellagio.  And no soups can beat the one in the Monte Carlo.  But to their defense, this is not their specialty.  They serve Chinese food.  Not the greatest in the world, but not bad either.  I like coming here since I rarely have to wait and can get your standard Chinese dishes at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Pho soup was really good..  Service is okay but far from the best.  I would go with the pho or the wonton soup."}
{"text":"A-ok for a restaurant in our hotel.  We were here a few years ago with our daughter and her friends and it's a quick meal, a bit expensive but convenient if you are staying at the hotel.  Server was friendly since we speak Cantonese (enough to order lol)."}
{"text":"It was not good. Would not go again.

Took them 20 min to bring the drinks - after we had 3 waiters and they took forever to come back and tell me they didn't have the drinks on the menu. 

The food was greasy and tasted just average. Service was slow And inconsistent. 

Don't bother"}
{"text":"All 5 of us agreed that this was the worst asian restaurant we ever ate at. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Really really not good. Very pricey - everything was watery for some reason - inside of egg rolls were mush, and noodles and dumplings in soup were tough - Many other places that are so much better to eat at Mandalay -"}
{"text":"I'm pretty generous with my reviews...and I gave this place a shot despite the terrible reviews because I was starving and it is so conveniently located to Mandalay Bay hotel rooms. 

I ordered the XO shrimp udon to go and it was TERRIBLE. And after tax $31.  So disappointed =T"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was pretty good. I wasn't blown away. Not bad for a casual meal but definitely not for a date."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! Don't come here. 

Horrible service!! Rude. 

Expensive but food was not worth it! 

My friends and I came here to get lunch and the soup we ordered was bland, the wontons were small and lacked flavor. The Thai food was extremely bland, and the the rice dishes....how can you mess up rice?!! 

When we asked the waiter to split the check , he made a big deal about it and gave us a scolding look and told us that we should have told him earlier. BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSE TO KNOW?!  No one told us ahead of time and all places let you asked for split checks at the end! 

Ridiculous. Don't come here. The waiter watched us write down how much tip we were giving him...he lingered behind us. And then picked up the receipt as soon as we put the pen down and stared at the tip amount in front of us and walked away without saying anything to us. 

So rude! Never coming back here!!! I think he might have also been the manager. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We got orange chicken and pas Thai noodles.
Service was good but food was terrible.

Worst orange chicken of my life :("}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews first.  Really too expensive for what you get.  My daughter thought her tofu dish was kind of bland.  I got the shrimp wonton soup and it was decent.  My GF had a beef/rice noodle dish and thought it was just ok.

Our waiter was super friendly and did a good job."}
{"text":"some haiku's

Fifteen dollar Pho?
Oh hell no, I don't think so
We shared other stuff.

Vietnamese drip
The coffee helped me revive
After long weekend"}
{"text":"We went in for a late dinner, about 9pm. Got the chicken chow mien and Singapore noodles. Both dishes came out pretty quick. Both were really tasty, and good size portions. Would have given 5 stars but for the cost."}
{"text":"We are ordering some wonton noodle soups and an appetizer of dim sum. Soup was just ok, the veggies were a little al dente and raw. The dim sum was ok, just a little sticky. The shu mai was a little dry on the edges and chewy. Lunch was okay but I'd probably look for other options within the resort."}
{"text":"I wish I had my phone on me before we ate at this place so I could've seen the bad reviews and decide to go somewhere else! The menu looked appetizing and promising but everything from the food to the service is just disappointing. I knew we should've left when we sat there for several minutes waiting for someone take our drink order.Three different people took our drink order but no one brought our drinks...it was so bizarre. Also, it was not busy when we arrived. There was one other table seated when we arrived. We were going to try the dumpling sampler until we were told it would take at least 20 minutes to prepare. I was going to try the Hong Kong noodles, but when the waitress described the dish to me, I decided to just go with the fried rice. My husband had the kung pao chicken, which was nothing special. The fried chicken lacked flavor and had more egg in every bite than anything else. If you want good food, keep walking, you won't find it here."}
{"text":"I should have Yelp'd to see the reviews for this so called Chinese food restaurant. If you want to pay for the atmosphere you are more than welcome to do so! The food was overpriced and not worth the money spent. My husband ordered a Mongolian Chicken instead of beef, they were not willing to change the price. I didn't even see any greens in his plate either!  I ordered a Dim Sum platter for two, which to my surprise was a serving for one. I would have gotten more at Ding Tai Fung! Oh by-the-way, they also charge you $5 for hot tea which is complimentary at other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"We shared a vegetable chow mein and vegetable spring rolls. There were barely any veggies in the chow mein and the spring rolls seemed like the standard frozen ones tossed into a deep fryer. I would only eat here again if drunk at 3 am with no where else to go. Service was fine."}
{"text":"The noodle soup with roasted duck was good, the grey goose martini I ordered tasted like a dirty dish towel. My wife sent back the Lettuce wraps saying they tasted like dog food. I didn't know she had eaten dog food before to compare. Who knew ?"}
{"text":"I paid $20 for a seafood pan fried noodle that was pretty bland. I ordered takeout, so if I had to say one good thing about this place, its that it took them about 5 minutes to make my food.

Other than that, if you're at the casino and you're hungry, do yourself a favor and get out to In-N-Out. Or, walk across the street to Panda Express and/or McDonald's."}
{"text":"Honestly horrible. Ordered tofu pad Thai and got chicken, plus it was just tasteless. The rice was overdone. There were more bean sprouts than actual rice. No flavor whatsoever. Never again."}
{"text":"Don't bother. I was served lukewarm cashew chicken that was under cooked. They took it off my bill but seemed to not understand why I didn't want it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were wandering around Mandalay Bay after visiting the shark exhibit and happened upon a The Noodle Shop. I did not check Yelp until after  we ordered our drinks and appetizer. I'm so happy we stopped there, the BBQ trio was lackluster at best. The chicken was rubbery, the pork was dry and the duck felt and tasted like it had been boiled. Please avoid this please. I expected more out of you Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Just had the worst crispy duck ever.  It is fat and not done.  Hard to eat.  The one star is for the waitress and the congee."}
{"text":"After coming to the Mandalay Bay for a few years and scoping out this place I knew that this trip we had to do it. I love any place that calls itself a noodle shop, especially one with the Asian flair. We found ourselves here for an early dinner and were quickly seated. It only took me a short few minutes before I knew I wanted it all. There was Laksa from Singapore, Ramen from Japan, Fried noodles from different provinces in China,l and the list went on and on. I ended up getting the Pork Ramen and the Duck with rice while my wife went with an assortment of different dumplings. Service was amazing especially the very personable manager that night who went from table to table in even more joy than myself this night. My Ramen was good, flavors were good with ample toppings to go with it, the noodles were very good. My duck was also very tasty and cooked perfectly to go with the rice and vegetables. Dumplings were o.k for the most part. Assorted dumpling platter seemed a bit small for the price but the chive dumplings were absolutely amazing even though they were overpriced. Overall I was happy with my experience, service like I said was amazing, from the manager to the buss boy. Prices were a bit high but I expect that at the Mandalay, and the food was good. I would definitely go back for another try next time I am in Vegas, Aloha"}
{"text":"Signature House Noodles was disgusting. No flavor! Grosssssss!!!! Staff was nice! Place was neat but food was simply disgusting"}
{"text":"We ordered Moo shoo Duck, Wonton Noodle Soup, and Pad Thai. The Moo Shoo Duck was a bit salty and the wrappers were dry and fell apart before anything was added to it. The wonton were really still and hard and you couldn't tell if there was shrimp in there or not. The noodles were soft, which was nice but not memorable. The Pad Thai was flavorless and the noodles were HARD!! 

The busboy who brought out the drinks was efficient. Our server who brought out our food was in some big rush even though the place was pretty empty. He reminded me of Jackie Chan, running around, carrying a zillion plates and putting them on our table so fast and talking a mile a minute that we could barely comprehend what was going on. 

The restaurant is pretty nice and clean, but I've had better food for half the price."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute joke! My husband and I were on vacation so we happen to get hungry while in the Mandalay Casino and decided this was most convenient. Our waitress (Wendy was her name) went straight to getting our drink orders and then came back to take our food order. She was not personable and she may hate her job. She then came back with our food and that was the last we saw of her. She didn't ask us how anything was or if our drinks needed refills. I then went to go pay for the bill and was just wanting to get out by that time. The lady at the cashier desk asked us how it was and after explaining our experience, she just said that she would speak to her after her shift. No apologies and nothing offered to help. A discount would've been nice being that the food was way better at any other food court eaten while we were there. But seriously don't even waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"This is bay far the worst \"asian\" food I have ever had the displeasure of consuming.  My group of 6 needed to have a quick lunch, and since we were staying at the hotel, decided to give it a try.

We each ordered something different on the menu.  I went with the beef noodle soup, while my friends tried the pho, broccoli beef, mapo tofu, pad thai, and some chicken stir fry dish.  To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.  They used the wrong sauces and the wrong noodles in each dish.  My friend that ordered the pho had to send it back (the first time he's ever had to do this at a restaurant).

This place should be shut down, then burned to the ground."}
{"text":"Please read, and listen to the reviews already published.  We, unfortunately did not.

Our review is primarily based on one menu item that we shared ... Malaysian Laksa Rice Noodle Soup.  This is described as a \"Fragrant Coconut Curry Shrimp-Based Soup Served with Assorted Seafood\".  $21,00 and plenty to share with an appetizer.  Sound great, right?

Reality .. a faint hint of coconut or curry, four medium shrimp hidden among the noodles and some \"balls\" of something.  With inquiry of our waiter, these were described as \"Fish Balls\".  This is considered ASSORTED SEAFOOD?  Really?!!

We asked for the manager to discuss the total mis-representation of this dish.  Fish Balls count as assorted seafood.  

He offered a minor discount, but should have just comped the entire dish.  We were too disgusted and disturbed to argue and continue a pointless conversation.

Don't go here.  There are better options."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3 star restaurant judging from our one and only experience here.

FOOD. We ordered the BBQ pork over rice and the beef chow fun. The BBQ pork was so-so, mostly because there was a strong spice in there that isn't in most BBQ pork rice dishes I've consumed in my life (I have had many, even in Hong Kong). Still, it was edible and all fine. The beef chow fun was the same experience... Ok / not great, pretty salty but still pretty edible.

SERVICE. Good actually! They checked in fairly often to see how everything was and if we needed anything else. No complaints. If anything, my only complaint was for the table beside us - Chinese mainlanders with a kid who was watching his iPad movie on FULL BLAST. So. Annoyed. 

The restaurant itself is well maintained. Felt clean, updated, etc."}
{"text":"This place was extremely quiet when we arrived. It was around 3pmish....so, in between the lunch and dinner rush. Even with only a few people here, our server took forever to take our order. Which was odd. She would just be walking around. Finally, a different lady came over and asked if we wanted to order....uh, yeah! Dont get me wrong, the servers were friendly. Just slow. 

Anyhow, I ordered the sweet and sour chicken and hubby ordered fried rice with shrimp, chicken, and beef. Not much to say. The flavor was bland. Nothing to get excited about. For the Mandalay Bay, kind of surprising this restaurant would just be so so. 

Long story short, will go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I'll give it 2 stars because the good was alright but definitely not worth the price. Seriously? $30 for a standard plate of noodles? And also the waitress had no idea what she was doing when billing our room and took forever for us to get out of there but not before asking if we were going to be taking a box for leftovers (my daughter couldn't finish all of her orange chicken) which we replied yes. She then ended up taking her food, which was roughly half a plate, and threw it away. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Would we ever eat here if it wasn't for the comp that comes with our stays?  Probably not.  Food tastes okay, but nothing tastes great for the prices they charge.  And this surely isn't Chinatown in LA.

Garlic shrimp, chicken & beef was a little sweeter than I would've liked.  But nice serving portion for two.  The shrimp wonton noodle soup was more bland than I'd like, but plenty of noodles and something like 6-8 (big) wontons, so hey, that's a definitely plus.  The calamari we probably wouldn't get again.  Cooked for too long as they were very chewy/rubbery, and the garlic salt & pepper didn't really cling on like the way it does when you order it from a 'legit' restaurant.

Service is okay.  Our drinks were refilled and nothing landed on the table cold, but then again we were wrapping up just as they started seating the ocean of people who were coming out of UFC 143, so I can't speak for how they are when they're busy. 

That food with two sodas cost us just a little over $55, including tax & tip, so not bad for 'hotel' food for two, but again, without the comp, we wouldn't be eating here.  I wouldn't recommend this place either.  I'll definitely take the Dragon Noodle Co (?) at Monte Carlo over this place (that one has combo dinners/specials for 2+ people with bigger portions, more choices & better food)."}
{"text":"I don't know where the negativity is coming from. 
I loved my chicken chow mein, and my husband loved his chicken pad Thai. We also shared the BBQ Pork Buns, and OMG they were soooo good!!

The service was on point too, waters were refilled constantly, and plates removed after finishing our meal.

I would definitely recommend this eater-y!!"}
{"text":"Definitely nothing to write home about with this place... so I'll write it here.  My group of friends (myself included) were NOT impressed with this place at all.  It was expensive and didn't seem like much food was brought to the table.

One of my friends became ill after eating here, and I think Asian fast food tastes better than what was served here."}
{"text":"This place is so bad. The servers were snotty when I asked for coffee, he  said \" we are a Chinese restaurant, no we don't have coffee\" umm funny because every other Chinese restaurant has it. No big deal. Then we waited a good ten minutes just to order. When my boyfriend asked the server if they had crab Rangoon's the waitress snickered and said no. It's not nice to be rude. If the answers are no then fine but snarky comments and snottiness need not be applied when we are spending our money!! Right then I knew we should have left but we were hungry and already went this far. Then the food arrives. My boyfriend ordered the Spivey pad Thai, I  had vegetable stir fry. I added the chicken which was an extra $8!!!! Our food was so bland. I never add spice but this needed something. The flavor was completely missing. This restaurant is the worst Chinese food place I've ever been to in Vegas. You'd think Mandalay would have removed them and not renew the lease by now. It doesn't belong in Mandalay much less any where else in Vegas really. Rude staff, terribly long wait to actually be served, and horrible food. Way over priced for the quality. Do yourself a favor and go to one of many other places inside Mandalay, you'll thank me later. I wished I would have checked yelp before coming here."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years. Service is consistently inconsistent. Today's waiter seemed angry. Food is usually good (not excellent) but if you need a quick meal between conference sessions this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"The worst place I have eaten in a five star hotel, we went to eat after the Michael Jackson show, we didn't have that many options since it was pretty late and most places were closed or about to close, we tried this place since it looked nice and the menu seemed appetizing but we were very wrong bad bad choice, we paid $21 for a seafood pho that tasted so bad that we couldn't eat it, nothing our party of seven ordered was even decent to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Convenient hours for late night dining!"}
{"text":"I realize this has bad reviews but we went there last night and it was wonderful.  The staff was funny and helpful. Food tasted great for the price. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"read karen's review. 

I'm the guy who wanted to throw up."}
{"text":"My mom, aunt and i were in a hurry to find something to eat so we can go catch our Lion King show in 30 mins! We went in and were greeted by a really nice lady who gave us our menu, our waitress came and asked us if we wanted something to drink and my aunt was like \"I'm sorry but we're in a hurry and we're hungry so we were wondering if  we can order the shrimp fried rice and the tom yum soup, and if you can make it really quick?\" and she was like \"Of course! so she put in the order came back and was like \"would you like to pay now since i can take it and get everything done for you so you can eat and go?\" 

and my aunt was like \"that would be awesome!\" and guess what...the food came in i swear 5 mins super fast! The fried rice was okay...there are better places and the soup was eh...could have been better. We ate like we were in the military or something...thats what my mom said lol

would we go here again? Maybe when we're in a hurry like that hahahah"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was hungover and I was craving a soup like dish. He ordered their PHO which was mediocre for how much it costed. But lets be real, it's the strip and Mandalay Bay. It's like trying to get Costco price alcohol on the strip. Not happening. :/ I ordered their PORRIDGE w/ the black egg (\"thousand year old egg\"). I enjoyed my dish, but agree with my boyfriend. The cost of eating there was a bit more expensive, but we were in dire need of some soup based meals!!! Aside from the cost of the food the service was still really good. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I was there in January of this year with my sister.  We both had the Shrimp, BBQ Pork, Scallop, Sea Bass, and Won Ton Soup with the added noodles.  It was really good.  I think it was about $25 which is pricey but considering what we got in it-understandable.
Service was fine-not like Chinese restaurants in Hawaii where they are almost mean to the customers!  Haha.
I'm wondering if the bad reviews are more for the entree type dishes.  My sister and I had no problem with our saimin/noodle dishes or the service."}
{"text":"We only walked in because nothing else was open at 11:30pm on a Saturday night. We sat down to a sticky table, the lady handed us some wet straws. We ordered the calamari appetizer and the Mongolian beef which were both way under Panda Express level. The Mongolian beef was drenched in sauce, and the calamari came out after we finished our dinner entree. This place is horrible, SAVE YOURSELF THE TRIP AND DONT GO. Order some room service instead. And it was expensive for what it was, paid $40 for this unpleasant meal."}
{"text":"Decent quality noodle soups here, but docked 2 stars on the value proposition.  What goes for $13-$15 here, can be had for maybe $7 in Chinatown.  2x for the Mandalay Bay premium seems a bit high.  This place used to be more of a cheap eats business, but has since changed."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! I waited over 20 minutes for the worst, overpriced meal I had in a long time.  My takeout order was the roasted duck with rice.  A pretty basic choice -the duck was over cooked and salty.  

The meal seasoning must have been all MSG, because my entire body started itching  & developed hives.

If Maladay Resort was smart it shut it down.  Foolish of me for not reading the reviews first."}
{"text":"Good hangover food at the Manday Bay Resort.  The duck and noodle soup ain't bad.  Kimchi was average at best."}
{"text":"The 2nd star is for being open so late. The food is overpriced and not good at all. Meats were fatty and too well done. The shu Mai was not edible.   To further annoy me, not only were all the BBQ meats fatty and too tough to eat, when I was starving, but I was asked when I ordered if I would like rice with it?  I assumed in typical Chinese restaurant style this meant it came with it so I said yes and was then charged $4.25 for it. 
Are you kidding me?
The shrimp dumplings were the only thing that was good. 
I would never ever again come here for this overpriced terrible food."}
{"text":"Yuck, Yuck, Yuck!

The name is Noodle Shop, yet their noodle soup is probably THE worst on the strip or in the entire Vegas.  AND probably the most expensive too!  If you are stuck in Mandalay and you must have a bowl of noodle or you will die - still, don't go there. Just pick up a hamburger and go to bed.  Yes, it is that bad!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Fairly authentic. Fast, tasty and economical. I would recommend if you are craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"I wish I read the reviews 1st - before dinning here! 

It said 2 stars - that's accurate! 
How do you mess up Pad Thai!? 
Sauce was off / noddles were egg noodles, not rice :/ 

2 stars for clean / good service
1 star for food"}
{"text":"Good food decent price only complaint lettuce wraps made with romaine everything kept falling out but the taste was really good."}
{"text":"Never come here. The food is terrible. We ordered the chicken wraps and didn't even know what it consisted of it looked and tasted horrible. Ordered the chicken satay and yuck that was bad too. We ordered the veggie spring rolls that were super mushy in the middle and probably only tasted decent because they were fried. They need help in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place was very bad I ordered chicken chowmein it tasted like they used oriental ramen powder  and soy sauce.  The green onion pancakes tasted like they were frozen. My wife dish was god awful the veggies tasted like they were canned and the sauce was bland. Service was very lacking. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"Not that good period over battered calamari , oily food and I would tell you what I really think if it was not comp'd.... wish they make this into a great Chinese food establishment , such a great culinary history to pull from and we get this"}
{"text":"Came here after checking in at the Mandalay late on Friday.

To be honest, this place was okay, but I'll give it 3 stars cuz the service was pretty damn good. 

I ordered wonton noodle soup. Not bad, not awesome. Big portion, just pretty average in taste.

BF ordered singapore style curry noodles. They were okay as well, nothing spectacular. I guess if you are hungry and it's late and you dont want to go to the Bellagio for their bomb ass noodle shop, then this is a good option.

We had the duck summer rolls to start. BLECH!! Just gross and hard and not worth it. Also had the shrimp shumai. Eh.. they were ok. Overall, this place was just ok."}
{"text":"I was nervous I couldn't order anything here that was vegan but there were actually quite a few options. I ordered the mixed vegetable stir fry and it was amazing! Had it over rice and added a little soy sauce. It was super good! Pretty big portion so it's good for 2 people to share."}
{"text":"If you're reading this and haven't sat down to eat yet, turn around and leave now. My husband and I have been to Vegas several times, and rarely have a bad meal. This trip we were here three days and this was the only \"meh\" meal we had (serves me right for not looking up reviews before we sat down.) 

We ate here out of convenience - needed a place before the Michael Jackson Cirque show (which is amazing, btw). All the reviews for this place are true. The food is mediocre at best - on par with food court Asian at triple the cost. Service was not good. 

All in all, it wasn't the worst dining experience ever, but it's expensive not good food with lackluster service. Skip it."}
{"text":"A little surprised by the negatives on Yelp.  It's a solid 4 star.  Great for a lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"Restaurants are a hit and miss and if you truly only rely on reviews to dine at a place, you might have missed out on a lot of good places. Then again, everyone's food preference is different. What may be tasty to you might not appeal to everyone and vice versa. 

Based on Yelp, this Noodle Shop is rated poorly, two stars in fact and I'm glad I didn't refer to Yelp before deciding to dine here. Some places has been overrated and in this case, underrated. Probably have CES to thanks too, since everyone is just super busy and just trying to grab a quick meal before hitting the convention halls. 

This is my 2nd time dining here since I got in for CES. Tried a total of 3 dishes: 

Noodles 8/10- The broth is tasty, thick and flavorful. I opted for the thick broth(hot and sour soup broth). Noodles were perfect, exactly how I wanted it to be and not over cooked. The Chili on the side is nice and compliments the dishes. 

Fried rice 9.5/10- I'm not a fan of soft, gooey, sticky fried rice. I love my rice \"separated\" in individual grains and still have that texture to every bite. This place serves the perfect Asian fried rice. 

Vegetarian fried rice $13
Shrimp fried rice $16 

Price point is not that bad considering this is Mandalay Bay and Vegas! Would I come back, of cos!"}
{"text":"If you like MSG, come to the noodle shop in Mandalay bay to get your $15 a pop wonton soup.  

While the service was impeccable and the waiters and waitresses were running around with their cute little Chinese restaurant accents (I am almost certain people do not talk like this normally - the Chinese accent for restaurants is totally romanticized.  i.e. I know plenty of Chinese people with terrible accents and enunciate on all the wrong harsh syllables.)

Anyway, I can't believe we paid almost $30 for 2 bowls of MSG noodles.  It's straight robbery, I tell you.  I'd probably do it again, if I was stuck in Mandalay bay and hungover."}
{"text":"I have been here two time and the foods was way over priced for what you got and tasted awful. I don't want to go into much detail because someone flagged my last review of this place, so this is my nice attempt to warn others not to eat here."}
{"text":"What will you pay for Asian food when you don't want to leave mandalay bay and you have a hangover?  This is the place!!

Not bad congee and onion pancakes. Vegetable dish was a little over cooked."}
{"text":"Expensive and bland!
My grandma always has to get her soup on when she gambles, so we came here and good lorddddddddd... I am better off eating Cup O Noodles in my room, which are so much more flavorful!  The staff could use some flavor too!  Everyone had this look on their face!  Maybe their coworker just passed away, and if that is the case, then I take back what I said, but if not, then based on their facial expressions, this is what they say about Noodle: \"Don't come eat this pathetic excuse of an Asian restaurant.\"
I know it is Vegas, so it will be generic tasting.  I'll give them a star for trying and another for their wide range of Asian dishes."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp wonton noodle soup. Overall it was average and overpriced. You are in Vegas and in a casino so the price was expected. If you're use to Chinatown authentic soup, this would not be the place."}
{"text":"Located in the Madalay Bay, this place is pricey for what it is.  Having a restaurant.com gift certificate definitely helped though, so I recommend that.

My friend had the pork dumplings.  There were only 4 but he said they were very good.  The Tom Yum soup was good as well.  

For entrees we had the mongolian beef and szechuan shrimp.  Good, but the place is pretty expensive so it should be good.  It's decent and so I may go back."}
{"text":"Since my son wanted some Asian food and this place is just downstairs we had to give it a try. We had BBq pork -roast duck combo. Fried rice.
All we good  also my son had the wor won ton soup.  As with every one else I think it was pricey for the type of food.  What I don't understand is 
if the food is blah why is it so dang busy.  The 1st time we ate there we were greeted and seated within minutes.  The 2nd time we ate there yes we ate there twice. The was a wait for about 15 minutes or so before we got in.  The waiter were ok although they do tend to forget about once they serve your food.  Over all experience 2 stars If I only knew there was a Panda express across the street you'll be better off eating there."}
{"text":"By far the worse noodle pla I've ever been too...I would of rather paid $20 for a Cup O Noodles....Save Yourself, and Walk Away"}
{"text":"Got the Tonkatsu Ramen. Didn't really care for it. Also my noodles looked like they were just dumped into the soup frozen. I could literally pick up all of the noodles at once."}
{"text":"It's easy to find and centrally located in the casino.  It's fairly large with plenty of seating, cute asian themed decor and seems deceptively nice.  But . . .  it is a disappointing lunch spot.

Firstly or waitress was hard to be found when needed, slow, not very friendly and overall not horrible but not good either.  We had to ask other staff in a nearly empty restaurant to help us.

The food.  Well I ordered the pad thai, it's a fair amount of bland food.  It just didn't have a lot of flavor, from the chicken to the noodles - nothing.  The peanuts were the only saving grace of the dish.  I also shared a pairing of meats including ribs and duck.  The duck was a little dry but fairly good.  The ribs though good hardly had enough meat.  So it was pretty ok.  The white rice was good . . . .

Of course it's expensive, it's Vegas but the quality of food and service did not match the prices."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ Pork Noodles.  VERY good."}
{"text":"Got the duck noodle soup and the wonton noodle soup.  Duck noodle soup is really greasy from the duck.  Shrimp wonton is not bad when my tummy is not feeling well.  Soup base is just right.  The down size is completely over priced.  Each bowl cost $17-$19.  It's nice to seat and eat a hot soup in an AC room."}
{"text":"When you're at a hotel, your choices for any type of food are usually limited. At Mandalay Bay, this Chinese restaurant doesn't disappoint...until you see the bill.

The beef chow fun was great and the won ton noodles were exactly what you'd expect from a Chinese place. The menu is fairly large with plenty to choose from. The food is tasty without the MSG overload of most Asian places. 

Overall, the quality seems fresh and the service is thankfully prompt and friendly. Everything is on the pricier side so be prepared or head to one of the many Chinese restaurants along Spring Mountain Road."}
{"text":"Disappointing flavorles & soupy pad tha with an off tasting filet of chicken sliced into.
I should have complained to the management to get a free meal comp for another Mandalay Bay  I think this was the worst pad that ever, boxed is better!"}
{"text":"Needed to spend a resort credit and no options were appealing.  We decided on this place and I found it to be adequate, but much too expensive for either the portions or the quality.  The pork buns were good, but at $12 for three they were way overpriced.  The vegetable curry I had was not very spicy, was heavy on the eggplant, and was only ok.  The best thing we ordered was sweet and sour chicken, but it was't much better than panda express and sure cost a lot more!  Wish I would have consulted yelp! before checking this place out.  One plus was that the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Panda Express is god compared to this place. Grossssssssssss"}
{"text":"We ordered 3 dishes.
Crispy Calamari for an appetizer.
Then, Orange Chicken & Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles w/ Sea Food.
 Crispy Calamari was oily rather than crispy in texture. I did not like the dipping sauce at all, too sweet for me. 
It could have been sweet & sour sauce...try adding the hot sauce.
Orange Chicken was missing orange flavor. It was strong garlic and soy sauce flavors. Rice was on dry side...
Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles w/ Sea Food was tasty. It was over $50 just for food..."}
{"text":"What a big disappointment.  The restaurant has the atmosphere of a McDonalds and besides the Chinese lanters overhead has no Asian flavor whatsoever.  Appetizers arrived before main courses and the food was mediocre at best.  I was positive that I'd been here 2-3 years ago and I'm sure I was at some version of the restaurant then but it looks like it moved and is now located in an annex of the cafe next door.  Funny how a bad atmosphere can make a meal feel cheap and that's what's happening at Mandalay Bay's Noodle Shop."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here because of my boyfriend's sister suggestion that this place has the best noodle soup. First thing, we just sit at our table for almost 15mins and no one pay attention to us even just water. Later, a lady came to our table to ask us about what kind of drink we want, unfortunately she just served drink not food. The water is awful, tap water....finally, we got our foods \"Shrimp and poor won ton noodles soup\" and \"Roast duck wonton noodles soup w/o roast duck\" and these are exactly one of the worse soup I have ever eaten.....never be back or recommend to anyone...."}
{"text":"Definitely underwhelming. The only redeeming dish was the egg rolls, which were better than average. Everything else was bland and beige. The Hong Kong noodle dish was ok, but not very flavorful, and the pad Thai was very bland. The BBQ pork steamed buns were interesting, but didn't have much flavor, and the texture of the pork was weird. The service was fine, but a bit curt. We wouldn't spend money on this again - you can probably get better food in any food court."}
{"text":"One thing I found it interesting is, you paid arms and legs in these kind of hotel restaurant, but the food doesn't taste good at all. 

We came here on Christmas day. The service is not very good. 20 min wait with tons of empty table. 

Okay. It is a holiday. I am not going to complain. But after we sat down, it took so long for someone to serve us. That is ridiculous. 

The food, is well kind of bad. It is eatable. But doesn't taste good at all. If you have a car, it is really better to go out and eat. 

Finally, the price... Too expensive !!!! It costs us over $30 per person. If you are not hungry for asian food, you may find a better place to eat in this hotel."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and we had a lunch break, my coworkers and I only had limited time to grab something to eat before getting back to work. We weren't able to check this place out last year when we came here, so there was no line this time and we were able to get seated pretty quickly.

Place looks nice, tables for small or large groups, nice booths etc. Menu had some good selections and a lot of items to choose from.  

I wasn't super hungry so I was thinking I could get an appetizer or two instead of an entree. I noticed they had some appetizers and a small dim sum selection on their menu so I went with that. I got the Chinese BBQ Pork Bao and some steamed shrimp dumplings.  

Pretty weak in my opinion. The BBQ Pork Bao I got was pretty average to below average, the BBQ was probably a day old and reheated, a little dry, steamed buns were a bit mushy and sticky so it was tough to stuff it when making your little sandwich. Comes with thinly sliced pickled cucumbers and some hoisin sauce.  Real basic looking, nothing fancy whatsoever at a high price. I didn't finish it.  

The steamed dim sum shrimp dumplings (har gao) came last even after my coworker's lunch entrees were served, for some reason they said it takes longer because they have to steam it.  Uhhh....sure, ok. Not much flavor, skin was a bit gummy, the dumpling skin comes off easily, I added quite a bit of soy and hot sauce to it to give it some life.... it was mehhh.  

My coworker's ordered some entree dishes like Kung Pao Chicken, I got a few bites because we close like that, good sized meal but at a high price, not the best cuts of chicken, not the most flavorful, it was just ok.  

Service was fine, pretty attentive, but the food just wasn't all that at that high price. We've been to most of the restaurants at Mandalay and most of them are real good but this place we will probably pass on. We were in and out of there in about 40 mins, so I had some time to stop by the roulette table before our work meeting, so that was a good thing."}
{"text":"The service was good and the wait staff was very friendly. The food came out quickly, and the ambience was nice. I was disappointed in the food, everything seemed very bland. We ordered orange chicken, vegetable fried rice, and bbq pork chow mein. I ended up adding chili sauce to the chow mein which helped give it some flavor. The best thing was probably the sauce on the orange chicken. I don't think I would come back, but it's a decent non-food court option in a pinch."}
{"text":"Horribly slow service. Our waiter maybe came around to our table once and when we asked a woman passing by for an extra bowl of rice I don't even think she understood. I found a lot of their noodles were oily and over sauced. Although my chow mein was good (generic) my friend did not enjoy his pad thai and said it made him want to throw up later."}
{"text":"I grew up eating congee in the most dirtiest of places in Chinatown in Manila.  Those have always been good.  

I'm a bit skeptical about the congee here at The Noodle Shop, (just because my surroundings are actually clean looking) but I've got such a serious craving for congee when I woke up and I wasn't having anything else.

Since we were staying at Mandalay Bay, it was convenient to eat lunch here.  I ordered the thousand egg and shredded pork congee ($10.50)  I had to season my soup with soy sauce but the pork itself is already salty. I like the big chunks of egg in there.  Bf had the wonton noodle soup, it was tasteless and for $14 wasn't really worth the money.

Our server was looking distressed from the many tables she was attending.  I thought she forgot about us, but she did manage to throw out a \"how's everything??\" , just as I was about to look up and respond, she was gone. 

Disinterested server and mediocre food.  A skip."}
{"text":"Broth bland. Everything we ordered is salty (jook, gong chow lau ho, won ton noodle). Overpriced. Poor quality food. Service was nice. Atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Overpriced and tasteless. Do not waste your money. The main dishes here had no taste. I think the chef was asleep. My family was totally disappointed. By far, the worst meal we had in Vegas. I would have enjoyed Burger King."}
{"text":"As with everything in Vegas, it was way too expensive here for what it was.
We ordered the dim sum smapler for two. One person could've ate it by themselves. The pieces were very tiny and it was just okay.
We also ordered the Hong Kong style pan fried noodles with beef and it was just okay. Nothing that I need to come back here for. 
Very underwhelmed with the place."}
{"text":"Meal started off ok with yummy egg rolls, however both my friend and my meals were not good especially for the price.

The chicken and vegetables had no flavor, was served in a runny sauce and the vegetables were undercooked.

The seafood soup also had no flavor. Even the rice was bad. How do you mess up white rice!!

Very below par good for the high prices. Will not return"}
{"text":"Lunch was actually really good.  It was at the Mandalay Bay.  I had the Hong Kong style crispy noodle with beef.  Lots of tender beef with mushrooms.  Salty base, hard to eat as soup.  The noodles were awesome and the beef very tender.  I think a few too many snow peas.   I could of had a little more beef.  Dish overall was a winner.  Staff was helpful.  Overall I recommend"}
{"text":"Hmmm The Noodle Shop. Me and the girls wanted something cheap and easy, and we didn't feel like going off the strip. So we went to old relible which is The Noodle Shop. We each order the same thing which was Kung Pao Chicken. (I know lame but hey) I ordered my extra spicy and they did not let me down. I swear we each had so much food but as hungry as we were, it was well worth it. Service was a little off but considering we were not in a hurry and had no where to be, it was quite ok.

If you are ever in Vegas and staying at the Mandalay Bay, stop over to The Noodle Shop. Yes the reviews are all over the place but you just may be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"There is no flavor in the food. The noodle tastes so weird and even worse than instant noodle. It has the worst wonton noodle I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I think this place deserves a higher than 2 stars for several reasons...

1. People are complaining that this place is expensive. Yes, you are in Vegas! It's like a giant airport, just expect to pay at a minimum double what you normally would for everything.

2. This place adds some variety. There's so many places that are just cafes/pizza places.

3. Their noodle soups are good. 

The beef brisket soup was good and so was their wonton soup! Just don't venture far from the Chinese noodle soups. (I saw someone getting a pad thai there and it looked pretty bad... Also, their pho was mediocre at best...) All in all, my experience was 4-stars especially because this is exactly what my body needed."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great, and the food was also disappointing.  I wanted some Chinese BBQ pork and the texture was a big grindy and there were still some \"wildness\" in the taste.  The rice was dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the folks who had not tried asian cuisine before and this place happened to be their 1st time. Worst Pho we have ever tasted. Incredibly bland, aboslutely no flavor. Bad service. And of course everything was overpriced. Such a huge disappointment for a great location."}
{"text":"Same as Annette (it was after my wedding ;D), and while I can't give it 4 full stars, I would totally give it 3.5 if I could.  They sat and dealt with 11 rowdy people with ease.  The prices were ridiculous, but it was a Vegas casino on the strip - it looked about as ridiculous as anything else we were at.

I got the shrimp, noodles, and XO sauce and while I had to add a good deal of chili sauce to spice it up, I thought it was delicious.  I also tried the orange peel beef, the chicken with black bean sauce, and some of the pho broth which was totally yummy.  Everyone I was with liked their food quite a bit!

I'd go here again if the opportunity presented itself - but being that there are so many restaurants in Vegas and I'm only there so often, I don't think I'd make it a priority though."}
{"text":"This was a nice source of comfort food to get ready for an evening of debauchery.  I had a bowl of Pho....actually a HUGE bowl of Pho!  My friend had a bowl of chow mein.  We were thoroughly satisfied with our cuisine.

The server was very attentive, nice, and efficient.  

This restaurant is located in within the cavernous halls of the massive Mandalay Resort."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this overpriced \"Asian\" establishment. The only reason I had to go here was because someone in my party really wanted Asian food and this was the closest location. 

I ordered the shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup which was not really that good. The broth itself was really bland and the wontons didn't have much flavor either. They were pretty much skimpy with the portions too. I wouldn't even pay more than $10 for this so it stung about my wallet and soul when I had to pay so much for this mediocre dish. 

Overall I do not recommend going here. If you want good and cheap Asian food just get it from Chinatown. There aren't that many good Asian restaurants on the strip so stick with other cuisines in the meantime."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried rice which was very bland had no flavor and we couldn't  find any chicken in our lettuce  wraps. Service was  a little slow but ok."}
{"text":"We thought this place was excellent.  The servers are always moving and very attentive.  We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and beef and shrimp in garlic sauce.  Both were delicious.  Prices were usual for an overpriced resort restaurant."}
{"text":"The Noodle Shop was our meal of choice on the even of the 2013 Chinese New  Year.  Located just off the casino floor in the Mandalay Bay resort, it is designed in a simple, and modern style.

The menu is a mix of Chinese, Thai and other dishes. However, if you are looking for true Thai dishes, this is not going to meet your desires. Lots of rice and noodle dishes, which are great to cure a case of the beer (or wine, or bourbon) flu.  Since I was suffering from a strain of the Guinness-Jameson blight, I chose a hot Green Tea and the Roast Duck noodle soup. This was the perfect cure. The duck was excellent, perfectly cooked, perfectly done meat, with a little bit of fatty skin.  The broth complimented the duck perfectly.  It also had some noodles and a little veg, though I wish there were a little more of the greens added.  My wife  had the Tom Yum Thai soup. Good but not really Thai style, missing elements like the lime and the sour style that is common.  When suffering from the 'flu' it is best to have a spicy dish. The hot bean paste condiment is excellent. Nice roasted and smoky flavor. It does pack a wallop.

The price was right and the service was quick and efficient, and friendly. The General Manager stopped by, asked about our meal and when asked, he gave us a little education on the pending Chinese New Year.  A very nice touch."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Oh no...one word in a nutshell: BLAND!  Located in the Mandalay Bay casino I don't know how this place stays afloat...you're  better off going to Panda express trust me!"}
{"text":"I come here to eat roast duck noodle. I always order double meat and the duck can't be fatty. It's always pretty good. One time I forgot to be fussy on my order like I always am. The duck in the soup was disgusting. If you like non fatty duck, don't forget to be fussy when you order your duck soup."}
{"text":"Inside Mandalay Bay, Great environment clean establishement .

I ordered the pork....or was it beef? noodle soup, it was ok , A giant plate of Mexican Clemole would have been better. The coffee was excellent! 

I am not an Asian food expert but I have found Thai food to be my favorite and what ever this was wasnt even close as taste is concerned . It was, hmmmmmm....decent."}
{"text":"Where the hell does a restaurant come off trying to charge $7.95 for kimchi?! My friends and I only ordered due to the convenience factor being that we were staying at Mandalay Bay. Everything on the menu was WAY overpriced for mediocre Chinese food. I'd have gladly went to a restaurant in Spring Mountain if we were mobile, but with the outrageous prices I would have forked over the cab money in retrospect. I think I was really grumpy that night due to lack of sleep (Vegas...), but things started off poorly after it took almost 15 minutes to get the beer we ordered. I'd talk about the food, but really it's nothing to really write about."}
{"text":"I should start out by saying that I live in NYC so I have several Chinatowns near me and have high expectations of chinese food.  That being said, the food was good but not great.  The main issue is the food was never hot.  I did go twice but only because I really wanted to try the Seafood Pan fried Noodles. I wasnt thrilled with it.  

The first day, I had the lunch special of chicken, shrimp and beef with garlic sauce and 2 mini spring rolls (the app should have been served earlier than the main and it was not, so tell them if you want it that way).  That dish was excellent and had it been hot, it would have been stellar.  It came with white rice.  The lunch special is 18.99 and they have about 8 choices of specials; my dish was enough for 2.  Service was slow the first day and quick the second day. My water was refilled constantly and the waiters were very nice as was the Maitre D.  It is a casual restaurant located right off the casino so there is some people watching to be done if you get a table closer to the front.  

I would recommend the restaurant for the chicken, beef, and shrimp dish but not for the pan fried noodles. I also would be specific and ask for very hot food and apps served first. None of these requests should be needed but if done, this review would have been markedly higher."}
{"text":"Wow.  This is awful.  Why did I not check the Yelp reviews first?  Only after eating here did I decide to look.  This was an embarrassment to Chinese cuisine.  Fatty, lukewarm duck that was inedible; gelatinous hot and sour soup; pot stickers with no filling that were obviously frozen; burnt egg rolls with nasty, strange flavors; and a mediocre ramen soup bowl.  Polite service, and they took some of the dishes off the check, but this place is a disaster.  Avoid."}
{"text":"This was our last dinner after relaxing for a few days at Mandalay Bay. We came for an early dinner so we beat the dinner rush. Service was good and our server was efficient. 

We had the pan-fried noodles with chicken, filet mignon with asparagus and an order of the tonkatsu Ramen. The meat entree came with only one small bowl of steamed rice but that was actually more than enough even with me grabbing a few spoonfuls every now and then. 

My hubby's favorite is pan-fried noodles. So when we saw this on the menu we HAD to have it. There was just enough sauce to coat and soften the thin noodles without making it too soggy. The chicken was tender and the veggies were crisp. 

The filet mignon and asparagus was light and delicious. The meat was tender and the asparagus was delicious and seasoned well. 

The girls shared a bowl of Tonkatsu ramen. I wish the noodles were freshly made but it worked. The broth was good and went well with the mushrooms in it. 

In the end, everything was eaten and there wasn't any leftovers. Definitely a good choice for us."}
{"text":"This place was ok! Not nasty but not amazing.
i ate the whole pad Thai dish because I was starving but it was pretty bland and everything felt wet. The chicken was wet and soggy.

Don't know if I would go back...
It's a mystery to me."}
{"text":"The noodle soup I ordered was salty and only had 3 shrimps and a few squids in a so-called seafood Tom yum soup. It was bad and way overpriced. Would never come back"}
{"text":"I tried The Noodle Shop when I was staying at Mandalay Bay for a convention and overall I was impressed! There was a decently long line to get in, so I figured the food would be good. Our waitress was not the best, she waited a long time to take our drink orders and some members of our party got the impression she felt inconvenienced and asked for things. I ordered the shrimp fried rice with scallops and chicken, and it was very good, although a little pricey. During our meal, the manager came by and made sure everyone was satisfied with their food. Overall, I was satisfied with the experience and I would be happy to eat here again."}
{"text":"If all my friends get upset stomachs after eating here, expect that you are going to deal with an upset yelper.

Trust me, I don't care so much if I get sick.  But when my friends get sick, THAT is the worst offense.  We couldn't really enjoy the rest of our night because our stomachs felt awful.  However, this is only the beginning of the offenses.

If my friends got sick, I wish at least I could say the food was good. IT WAS NOT! The food was not flavorful and noodles fell flat.  Some of our soups came out lukewarm.

The price of the food here too is completely ridiculous.  I understand that everything is a little overpriced in Vegas but COME ON! You are charging almost $20 dollars for poor quality pho?  You are better off gambling $10 dollars on slots and getting a burger and fries at McDonald's. At least then you would be decently full, maybe make some money, and still have your faculties about you to enjoy the rest of your day.

The one shining star was that the wait staff was super friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, this was not enough to overlook the poor quality and overpriced food here."}
{"text":"Oddly, for all the negative hype of this place, and the ridiculous price tag (and I'm talking ridiculous - I think we paid the same amount here as we did the Border Grill, and that's a signature restaurant while this one is labeled \"casual\" by Mandalay Bay), the food was actually pretty tasty.  I think the expense has to do solely with the fact that this is Vegas we're talking about - anywhere people can be bilked to fork over change, whether it be for fois gras or a plate of fried rice, it's going to happen.

That all being said, my potstickers and chow fun were tasty and came out of the kitchen hot.  I was satisfied and pleasantly surprised.  If you're stuck in Mandalay Bay and are craving asian, this is fine by mid-level standards."}
{"text":"I ate at the Noodle Shop several times while I was in Vegas. Initially because it had the shortest line but two more times because their menu was extensive and reasonably priced. I had duck last night that was delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times over the years when conducting business at the hotel/casino. I have never been disappointed with the soups. I usually order the Wonton Shrimp or the Duck.

There are many awesome Asian restaurants in Las Vegas, away from the strip with great food and decent prices.

I don't see this place as a restaurant locals would go out of their way to go to. They are serving hotel guests, gamblers or show attendees. They probably don't really care about their Yelp reviews as much as a local, non-casino restaurant would.

With that said, I would go back if I was already on the property and wanted soup but I would never go to this place as a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews that service here is really odd. We were seated immediately and then sat waiting for quite a while before the hostess came and took our drink order. I requested a Kirin beer, and then what seemed like a very long time later (and we flagged down staff to ask where our drinks were) I was given a carrot juice. Definitely a possibility of a language issue there... but hey, if you like carrot juice, they have it.

We ordered the Hong Kong Noodles and Singapore Noodles. The first was on the bland side while the latter was bursting with flavor. The Dr. the taught me a few tricks of using the provided sauces, spices to enhance the meal. The food was great and you get a lot for your money. We could have easily shared 1 of the noodle plates. 

Still the service needs to improve. As we ate, you could see tables around us also getting slow service and waiting for their bills. I stick with 3 stars based on the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Have roast duck on rice and mandarin braised beef noodle soup. The noodles and the rice part is good but not the meat. My roast duck has distinguishable skin and fat layer, which wasn't that enticing. I would expect a very good bowl of beef noodle soup but the texture of the meat is just too weird. I give an overall 3 start because the service is okay but food doesn't impress me that well."}
{"text":"It's been more than a week since I was here, but having just found the receipt from this restaurant in my wallet I felt it appropriate to warn all tourists to not eat here.

The Mrs. and I ordered soup and noodle entrees (Won Ton and BBQ Pork) which were tasty, but definitely not worth the $17.95 and $12.25 we paid. A few Thai Iced Teas later we were looking at close to $50 for two people eating soup for lunch. I understand the rules of traveling, especially when you go to Las Vegas. You'll normally spend $10 for every mixed drink and $8 for every beer. That's just how it works and it's fine if you get good food and great service, but that's not what we got.

I'm not sure if it was how we looked or dressed but our server \"Wendy\" was rushing us the entire time. She kept checking to see if we were done with our soup and kept peaking from behind the exit to see how much longer we'd be eating. Another server came by and tried to take our bowls when we weren't even done. They didn't even leave us an option for desert as Wendy rushed the bill to our table. For mediocre-good food, this place had poor service. I couldn't understand why they wanted us out so quickly, it's not like this place was busy at 2:51pm on a weekday afternoon. 

In Summary: The food was good, the tea was fine, the prices were inflated and the service was awful. Instead, go to the Chin-Chin restaurant at New York New York Hotel & Casino for amazing Asian food and top notch service with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Vegas is expensive, but it doesn't justify the price that the 'Noodle shop' is asking!  I can't quite remember, but I think the pho was like $15...  It's just highway robbery!

The place has small portion, and below average taste.    One of the dishes we ordered was the House special fried rice.  The waitress told us it has dry scallop, when the fried rice came we didn't see any.  Toward the end of the plate, then someone found like 3 small strings.

If this place was in Bay area, it would never survived this long  If you must order, the Hong Kong style noodle was decent taste."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time in Vegas so i know things can be expensive. This is, however, the first time we eat here. It's so expensive and the taste is meh. Our steamed flounder was over 35$ and you can see how small it is! It's so crazy! They don't even bother to make the plate looks nice. We are definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"For what is a \"go to destination\" resort the Noodle Shop disappoints. You can pretty much expect high price, poor service.  If you really want a good \"noodle restaurant\", venture down to the Golden Noodle at Monte Carlo and get great noodle dishes with much more in terms of value"}
{"text":"Overpriced, underseasoned, disappointing.

We spent $55 and got a cup of hot and sour soup, some seaweed salad, singapore curry noodles, noodles with beef and broccoli (it was $3 to add the broccoli), and a coke.

Friend said the soup was good, the seaweed salad was solid - right amount of sweet and sour, good variation in types of seaweed, yum - only downside was it was sort of warm.

Noodle dishes were not good. Singapore noodles were bland and very, very dry. Like sawdust dry. Tasted like they just mixed together rice noodles, curry powder, and oil. No delicious vegetables, just a few slices of onion, a few measly pieces of BBQ pork, and like 6 baby shrimp. Beef noodles were similarly bland, tasting of nothing but soy sauce. Thank goodness we added the broccoli because that's what was picked out and eaten.

Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"mmhmm...except for pre-req overpricing on every food item, it was delish and not msg-y."}
{"text":"Best chinese food ever in my life 

The real Chinese food for Asians!??????????????????????"}
{"text":"Absolute Assault on Otherwise Innocent Food!!!!!

What more, beyond the title, can I say?  The menu is unimaginative, especially for Vegas, and the food execution lacks depth of flavor and attention to protein temperature.  Every single dish (eight in total) was over cooked and underneath that failure of temperature was an embarrassing selection of D-grade meats.

Not even the poor choice of sake is worth the calorie consumption.  

Vegas opened a new Taco Bell with a DJ!!!!  Settle for that."}
{"text":"Expensive for Pho. Worst Pho I've had to date...I wanted to eat all of it because Iwas paying so much for it, but I couldn't stand it any more...I ended up leaving my bowl 1/3 full. I ate at Viet Noodle on West Spring Mountain the other day for less than half the price of this Pho and it was some of rhe best Pho I have had in Las Vegas. The lettuce wraps were sub-par. P.F. Chang's lettuce wraps are much better...and less expensive. Service was quick and decent. Though, the restaurant wasn't very busy at 8:30 on a Monday night."}
{"text":"The one star is way too much for this place , the most horrid food I have ever had .. Panda Express is fine dining compared to this. I ordered calamari to start and cashew chicken for my entre , the cashew chicken came first and it was really not edible , I never in my life had to spit food out until I tasted this sh....,  I really think this chicken was really old and had gone bad , it had a funky taste  and not in a good way ,, then my appetizer arrived and it was so bad I. Really couldn't get my self to eat beyond 2 bits.... How is this place in business ??? Why ???"}
{"text":"Worst Asian food I've ever eaten. Stopped in because we were in the mood for noodles. Had the chicken Hong Kong noodles and lo mai gai. The restaurant smelled like a bad fart. The noodles were similar to uncooked ramen, and were covered in a thick cornstarch like Chinese goop. We knew it was going to be terrible when we realized you could get pad Thai, pho, and Steamed pork buns all at the same place. The lo mai gai took forever, and surprise-- smelled like a fart when opened. I would eat it normally only if it was the only thing available. I saw a sad lonely man at one table and two old white ladies sitting together, not knowing any better. Perfect for them I suppose. Literally the worst food I've eaten in years. Avoid at all costs, there is great Asian food everywhere but here."}
{"text":"We came here one afternoon, after a morning of heavy drinking by the pool. We ordered a fried rice dish and something with duck. The service was very quick, the atmosphere was very nice and the food was delicious. It helped sober me up enough for the evening and was definitely the best food quality and portion size to price ratio we found in Vegas. 

The place was almost completely empty while we were there, maybe that's why things were better than other reviewers are reporting, but for whatever reason, I had a very nice experience there and would go back if I were staying at Mandalay Bay again."}
{"text":"The food here is just not good. I had the Singapore noodles and they were the worst I've ever had. Stay away."}
{"text":"The food is way overpriced for the quality. We had spring rolls-more greasy than most and soggy in the middle. My pad thai tasted nothing like pad thai-just grease and a cheap sauce, no flavor. My husband had the house fried rice and it was steamed rice with a few veggies and cold shrimp. He had a coffee and I had green tea. Our bill was $60. Nothing was good. We will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This is more of a 2.5 star review. The only hit was the hot and sour soup which is one of the better ones I've tasted. However we were disappointed with the ma po tofu and the chow mein.... both were almost cold...definitely not cooked fresh. Even though the service was good, when we ordered the ma po tofu the waitress said \"oh that is spicy!\" As if these gringos can't handle the heat! This made me excited that this might be an authentic Chinese dish. Much to my surprise it had hardly any spice at all! Wine is overpriced. Dining here made L'atelier Joel Robuchon the night before look like a pretty good deal!"}
{"text":"I could give no stars if it were an option. My husband and I stay at Mandalay Bay frequently, and end up eating in some of the newer restaurants since the renovation. My husband LOVES noodles, ramen, udon everything... Ordered the spare ribs appetizer, they were luke warm, ordered the beef stew for myself that I was told my our waitress was THE BEST. It smelled of fish and was FULL of fat.... had the waitress take it back and ordered something a little easier, Pad Tai Chicken and it was RAW! We ended up leaving, and with the manager not being very surprised at our reaction, I can imagine it happens alot..."}
{"text":"Been here twice, always enjoyed it, generous portions, great staff, the beef noodle soup and bbq pork rice was good, my family raves about the Thai Ice Tea!!! A nice spot for some hot noodle soup."}
{"text":"UGHHHHHH! after we ate here we were immediately dying from all of the MSG used in the food...everything was WAY too salty. and its very hard to make congee taste bad but they did...

my husband had the pho and a friend of ours had the pad thai.......both of these were absolutely disgusting!!!!!! Its a cute fast place but the food is absolutely disgusting..."}
{"text":"What the.... worst Asian restaurant I have ever been in. Terrible food, terrible time. They poured something odd in the water. Terrible noodles, terrible service. First and last time."}
{"text":"Server Wendy- service 2/10 ( very low China town style )
Food: 2/10 - ( are you sure is Chinese chef at kitchen?? )
Price: 2/10 ( over price )
Portion: 3/10 ( too small )
Coming back ? / you got be kidding"}
{"text":"The worst pad thai we have ever had and the waitress just threw food at us and ran off.   They were understaffed and the quality is horrible."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend recommended that we eat at the Noodle Shop since we were already at Mandalay Bay Casino. We ordered a Seafood Wonton soup and a BBQ over rice dish. Wow! The BBQ Pork was so tasteful and perfectly cooked! Its probably the best BBQ Pork I've tasted.  The Customer Service was pretty good! Prices are a bit higher here for Chinese food. One thing I would complain about is the price for tea here. They charge $4.00 a person for hot tea? So we pretty much paid $8.00 for a pot of tea? Thats right! I guess thats the price you have to pay to eat at a Restaurant inside a casino."}
{"text":"Glad I didn't read the reviews before I ate here.  Actually ordered to go twice during our stay.  Ordered only two items and both times my daughter and I were very happy with the food.  The hostess actually recommended these two items. Yes expensive for Chinese food , but isn't everything in Las Vegas expensive? The pork, chives and shrimp dumplings had a solid amount of meat in it with a light dumpling skin.  Only 4 of them but so delicious.  The chow mein was so great especially at 10:30pm at night.  Both hostesses who took my order were very friendly and my food was ready within 10 min.  We got Togo a second time because I knew my daughter wanted it again.  I'd go here again to our next visit to Mandalay bay."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the restaurant or service because we ordered food to go to take it to the pool. 
I got the chicken chow mien and my husband got the shrimp dumplings. Both were really good. The chow mien was flavorful and packed with chicken and veggies. I would order to go again! 
She also gave us waters in to go cups for the pool!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such a bad wrap. I have been going here since they opened, which was a long time ago
Tonight I had the shrimp dumplings, hay graw and BBQ pork which were all delish
I also managed to have a Sapporo with sake. I will admit that the price is ridiculous though... Favorite spot so it won't stop me!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the prices were a little steep.  I would skip this place and head to any other restaurant at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"If you've ever picked up a piece of gum off the sidewalk, chewed it for awhile, then spit it into someone else's mouth, that's probably the most accurate estimation of this dump's chicken chow mein. The service was unapologetic for how toxic the food tasted. Hot and sour soup was a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My favoring chow mein is Chef Chu's near Mountain View, CA. My next favorite? Noodle Shop in Mandalay Bay!!. Good service, noodles were perfectly cooked and pan fried with just the right amount of spices, vegetables and plenty of white meat chicken. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great place for vegetarians, no disappointments with any dish ordered over 3 visits ! Highly recommend the green thai curry!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to grab something quick after the NKOTB concert and before drinking at LAX, shared an order of beef chow fun.  It was super greasy, we were hungry so we are it all.  After finishing it you can see all the grease that was left on the plate....ick...oh well, don't have plans to eat there again. Just gave it a shot since it was convenient to where we were coming from/ where we were headed."}
{"text":"After a few days in Vegas doing what you do in Vegas -- eat, drink, eat, drink, rinse, repeat -- I wanted something \"light\": Asian food! In more of a hurry and not really caring we ducked in here for a quick lunch. I really wish we would have tracked down a Pei Wei instead...

The pan seared pork (and shrimp) dumplings were very good, but the Pad Thai shrimp fell short. We weren't quite sure what was going on with it, but as my friend noted, \"why is it so orange?\" might have been one thing. The shrimp were definitely frozen and beyond small, over cooked, etc.

Stick with the dumplings, steer clear of the Pad Thai shrimp."}
{"text":"Huge portions- must have traditional taste for Chinese-  I hated - hubby said was good- he eats anything-"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here twice during our stay at Mandalay Bay, despite the bad reviews on here and it was great. We were seated promptly and someone came up to take our drink orders right away. After giving us a couple minutes to study the menu our server came up to take our order. We got the Chicken Chow Mein and the Chinese Broccoli. It only took 10 minutes to arrive before us and it was good. The chow mein was not too greasy and had plenty of flavor and my 5 year old daughter and I are picky about our chow mein. The broccoli was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of oyster sauce. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Anyone that gives this place more than two stars deserves to have their yelp account taken away. 

Got the cheaper kung pao chicken (14.50 I think) and immediately regretted it. I would pay 5 dollars for that entree. 

Also, the noodles my friend ordered came out in less than 5 minutes. 

I don't know about you but 5 minutes is not a lot of time to cook(reheat) anything. 

The only reason any1 should ever come to this place is when all the other places inside the hotel are closed.

Make sure to plan your day accordingly :)"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that the food was great! Service was attentive. The Restuarant looks small but it's not it's cozy. Now for the price that everyone complains about, seriously everything on the strip is going to be pricey honestly if it's to expensive then stop complaining and go to McDonalds they raise there prices on the strip. When going to a resort in Las Vegas be prepared to spend money!!! Overall service was great and on top of their game, the food quality is great and the entrees were phenomenal. I see bad stars for this Restuarant but honestly it was most likely from people who can't afford  it  and are looking to complain about something. This place was great and I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My waitress was very sweet - I appreciated that she mentioned that my dish had peanuts in it, even though that is almost the only thing I'm not allergic to.  Stupid allergies.
Anyway, the space is lovely, if you have your back to the entrance, you might forget you're in a Vegas casino.  
I had the kung pao chicken and it was delicious!!!  $17 delicious?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Came in to get soup to go. Got ignored for 6 minutes, ended up leaving. Probably just as well since the ratings aren't all that great to begin with."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here for lunch before we were to head out to the Airport. It wasn't something I will rave about forever and a day. But it wasn't bad either.

It hit the spot. I'll take it :) Chicken wasn't over cooked. Sauce was flavorful. It worked quite well in a pinch when we were having a hard time trying to figure out what to do for food before our airport shuttle arrived."}
{"text":"It's ok food. A little better than your normal Chinese but that's all. Service was fast. Portions are normal sized for a Chinese. It's pricey, 70 bucks for 3 but it's normal prices for Vegas. Definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"The food is too pricy for the quality. Spare ribs were not the best, soup was very plain  and both entrées were loaded with sodium      and were below par.  The staff is friendly and offered good service.  The atmosphere is nice but what good is a pretty cell phone with bad reception and dropped calls? Would never come here again."}
{"text":"We saw the review and were worried. Yet we decided to give a try. Turned out we really liked it! We ordered a fried rice, magnolia filet and a veggie and we were happy about it. It's more like Cantonese style food and the service is pretty good. I'm glad we can have some decent Asian food at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"I went here in July 2012 and the service was horrible! The hosts and servers barely spoke English. We asked how big the portions were and our waitress couldn't even tell us, she didn't know. She just said, \"order your food, if not enough, order more\". Once we got our appetizers, they were extremely small. There was not enough for even two of our five party members to eat. We ordered pad thai, which was actually good but they brought us toppings to put on it and there were jalapeno and habanero. We were not told that there would be such spicy peppers. One of our party members is allergic and did not realize they were the spicy kind. She started choking and had to spit it out. We talked to the manager in the end and she made light of the whole situation. All in all, my biggest concern was the major language barrier and the lack of knowledge of the employees."}
{"text":"Wow really? 

I was way too hungover to check yelp before coming here.  That's the last time I make that mistake.  It was way overpriced and flavorless.  Our group had the wonton soup with noodles.  The broth was like boiled water.  I had the lunch special with mongolian beef and hot and sour soup.  Some special at almost 20 bucks.  Not much beef.  Also there were flies in the restaurant.  I could accept that at a hole in the wall joint not a place inside mandalay. 

PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!"}
{"text":"completely overpriced. service is slow. food is moderate.. would not recommend the pho or the preserved egg congee. but I guess if you are trapped in the Mandalay and must have Chinese food (and money is no object).. then consider yourself forewarned."}
{"text":"So the waiter was very nice. The sake was awesome. The sampler platter of cooked dim sum was mediocre and my dinner plate of chicken lo mein was so salty I couldn't finish it. The restaurant was clean but they really need to up their food quality. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"The food at this place is sub par, bland and not worth the money. You are better off going to panda express across the st. I was starving and checked in super late, so I had no choice."}
{"text":"A really sad establishment where servers give zero ****cks and said they only give you forks to eat with and no spoon except tea spoons and giant spoons."}
{"text":"Garbage. Garbage. Garbage. Over priced garbage. They should be embarrassed they are making this food. It's not nice to charge so much and give small portions and garbage tasting food. They were rude as well. ITS OFFICIAL... FOOD SUCKS AT MANDALAY BAY. ROOM SERVICE SUCKS TOO."}
{"text":"Yikes...their standards have dropped yet again from 2 years ago.  I don't care about the price - it's going to be expensive - as another reviewer has mentioned, you're in Vegas.  Seriously.  

However, I ordered a BBQ pork w/ rice dish and the rice was over dry and the BBQ porked lacked any sort of sauce.  I was also given 2 dingy pieces of Chinese broccoli that was way overcooked.  

Overall, it was a very mediocre dinner.  I don't think I'd ever go again."}
{"text":"Wow, where to begin with this place. Only came here because of my brother in-law. He kept saying how great this place was and plus every restaurant there was pack expect this place. I wounded why... So I by pass looking at the tips and reviews that everyone wrote so I can give this place a fair chance.

So soon as we put our name on the list we waited only for about 5 mins. Okay, that is cool place didn't seem so bad. Right? Place look clean, got seat away from everyone else so it was a nice family style of five. Then this is when the stars kept on falling here... We waited for ten mins for the server to get us water and our orders to be put in. We had to flag some manger to get someone to attend to us. 

Now comes the good part dinner. We order fried calamari, pancake, and BBQ pork. Out of the three the BBQ pork was the best. The pancake was too powdery too me. And the calamari it was all batter! Horrible. As for our main course the duck soup with noodles was bland. Shrimp fried rice was okay but lucky for me they had sriracha  the house special noodles was okay but again sriracha is needed again.

To sum it all up, come here for BBQ pork. If you really have too. I mean if you have no where else to go and your super hungry. Other than that if you still have the power to wait else where to eat then go somewhere else. This was not worth the money or time to try."}
{"text":"i was surprised coming here for the second time. I ordered beef noodle soup and it was pretty good.  It is pricy for casual chinese but it is expected."}
{"text":"Oh dear Oh dear. How can you go wrong with chinese broccoli and oyster sauce? Well let me tell you can. And the spring rolls were like little cigars dripping in grease and you could not taste the veggies inside. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people are so down on this. I would give it 3.5 to 4 stars.

I was these for a convention so I grabbed a quick lunch   I had the shrimp udon with xo sauce. The noodles were very good tender and the portion was large.  The flavor was good not too salty at all.  Lost of onions and scallions which I liked. It was served piping hot.

I also tried the shrimp shumai. They take longer to make. These were a bit tough and over steamed.

The service was very good and attentive.   I definitely preferred this as a reasonable lunch option in a resort that is not the greasy food court."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE NOODLE SOUP, but boiling hot soup sure does help from a night of hard partying in Vegas. Sure it's 110 degrees outside, but inside the Mandalay it's a cool, crisp 70+ degrees!

I only had the Roasted Pork Egg Noodle Soup and I must say, I LOVED IT. I loved watching the oil sit on the top layer of my soup (HELLO, oil is the cure to a mean hangover in my book).

Oh and I really did want to try the Har Gow but I couldn't justify spending $8.50 on something that usually costs less than $2. 

I'm going back to Vegas in Sept... so I'll be here again. Prices suck, yes.... but it's going to be the same no matter where you go!"}
{"text":"We made a big mistake coming here. We were craving Chinese food and this was the only place that we saw open. I ordered a won ton soup and my wife ordered a chicken dish. When we both finished we both came to the same conclusion. The food was the blandest we ever tried. After reading the reviews I realized the mistake we made by walking in here. I highly recommend finding anywhere else to eat."}
{"text":"We came here because it was open late.

1. Hot & sour soup tasted like tomato soup.
2. shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup was delicious.
3, fried rice was ok.
4. Staff was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Oh Boy, nothing sums it up than the service felt very forced and not very courteous from the hostess who sat us, and yes the server herself. You know that ominous feeling like you're just another digit versus maybe a repeat paying customer? Yes that feeling, like asking to get more menus for all of the people in the party? Isn't that restaurant 101 or were they that short on counting fingers to figure it out! The menu: typical choices you would find at all fast food \"Chinese\" take out. Flavor: tasted like the typical \"Chinese\" food from any average casino buffet. I say that because we were staying at Mandalay Bay and went to Bayside Buffet and the \"Chinese\" items were that much better! We had a fairly big party of 14 people, but there was maybe another 3 little parties in the restaurant the whole time we were there. 6 o'clock Saturday on Easter weekend. This place was empty, the service was lacking, you had to ask for everything (refill, napkins, etc). With a handful of workers just standing on the side wall coming from the kitchen, they should've been more attentive to a big party. The only item that was half decent was the Beef/Broccoli only because it was the only entree that came out like it was made to order and was somewhat hot. Everyone's meals were room temperature or looked undercooked. Everything was BLAND! Makes you wonder who cooks and manages this place in a nice Hotel like this. The second star is because the place was clean, other than that all negative reviews are true about this place. I for one would never recommend it no matter the convenience because you'll be paying the average price of $16-19 an entree, where your average good Chinese restaurant you would pay about half across the board. Service :1
Food:2
Price:1  
You get the picture, avoid, avoid!"}
{"text":"If you want the most expensive, least bang for your buck, biggest ripoff of a restaurant you can imagine, come here.  $8 for a bowl of soup (3-4 spoonfuls)?  My Chinese ancestors, preaching a culture of frugality, are rolling over in their graves.  I hate this place for making me feel so unjustified for spending that money...and seeing as that's all you do in Vegas w/ gambling and partying, for the Noodle Shop to be my biggest loss that weekend is just sad."}
{"text":"usually places that serve multiple types of cuisine can't hang, but i actually found the food at the noodle shop to taste just like at back home.  too bad the prices are double what a normal SGV restaurant would charge.  it IS vegas afterall, so you really shouldn't be surprised.  

for the convenience factor of being inside the mandalay bay, and the fact that you can satisfy everyone in your groups craving with choices ranging from won-ton noodle soup to pho, i was pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"The service was great even though she was very busy.  We ordered salt-pepper park and Hong Kong pan fried noodles.  I gave it a 4-star rating because our food came warm not hot.   It was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my parents since we didn't want to leave the hotel. We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap and shrimp fried rice. My dad and brother really enjoyed the the fried rice while the chicken lettuce wrap was just whatever for the price we've had better"}
{"text":"Never ever go here.  Really bland overpriced food with horrible service.  

I've had better kung pao chicken out of a frozen bag from Trader Joe's....much better actually."}
{"text":"On our last day in Vegas, everyone wanted to eat something different. As for me, I remember seeing the noodle shop, and having some hot noodle soup or chow mein sounded yummy after drinking all weekend. So, our group headed over to the noodle shop.

First off, the service is really really bad here. The service is slow, and half of the staff doesn't know what they're doing. Granted you don't get good service in a Chinese place, it was still worse than many other places. Our waiter just didn't care about anything, and never came back to ask how our food was or refill our water. On top of that, we wanted to split the bill at the end. So the way we usually do that, is write each person's last 4 digits of their credit card number and the amount they want to have charged on their card. At every restaurant, waiter's are please to see us make it so easy for them, and have it done right away. However, the staff here just couldn't figure it out. We waited a total of 20 minutes just to get our bill back. I noticed that there was about 4 people trying to handle the bill, and none of them could get it, so they finally had the manager come out. After the whopping 20 minutes, we finally got our bill back.

As for the food here, let's just say I much rather go to Panda Express for my Chinese food. I ordered chow mein, and it was soo bland and soo oily and greasy. I can't cook Chinese food for shit, and I could whip something better up.

Overall, I was really disspointed since I was craving some good , or even settle for decent, Chinese food. Good thing I went over to my aunt's house after and she made me some amazing Cantonese food."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Four Seasons in Mandalay Bay and decided to grab a bite before our flight. The menu options look appealing, although overpriced but I made the mistake of not checking Yelp beforehand...

Ordered the Spicy chicken curry and white rice. The chicken had absolutely zero flavor to it. The entire dish was bland with barely a hint of any curry. I added mounds of red chili and soy sauce for added flavor just to make the dish palatable. 

Service was okay, nothing great. Would not return"}
{"text":"The food was so whack. My dad and I ordered the wonton noodles and they were very soft, almost like rice noodles instead of a slightly gummy/al dente texture that egg noodles are supposed to have. My dad's coworker ordered pad thai, which was oddly yellow in color, something I've never seen any restaurant make before. They also didn't have any Vietnamese coffee because they were apparently having issues with their supplier or something. The prices are high, but it is what it is being a Vegas hotel restaurant. 

The waiter on the other hand was very friendly and I felt bad for him because it seemed like he was struggling handling the bowls of very hot soups."}
{"text":"Love the Mandalay Bay and this is a nice restaurant, but the noodles weren't awesome.  They could have used more flavor.  Great service though."}
{"text":"I wrote a favorable review for Raffles, and The Noodle Shop is next door...or rather in Raffles or an appendage thereof.  You would think they shared the same kitchen

This is a different review...I did not enjoy my won ton soup with noodles..It was bland and tasteless.  Perhaps, I cant remember enjoying a soup less..and I am happy with Campbells

Yet at the same time, everyone seemed to enjoy their selections:  Fried rice, Orange beef, Marinated chicken, Pad thai, Veggie spring rolls

So what am I saying?  Go to The Noodle Shop except for Noodles?"}
{"text":"This place is honestly not all that bad. The rating for the Noodle Shop is probably low just because A) not everything here is tremendous and B) the prices. I get it. The prices are lofty, but the food is homey and comforting.

We decided to get the dim sum sampler, the duck noodle soup, the shrimp dumpling noodle soup, and the sichuan.

The sampler? Probably not worth the $20. You get four different types of dim sum, with 2-3 pieces of each type. Tasty, but it might've been better if it were $10 or so.

Everything else was very good. The duck in the noodle soup was perfectly cooked, the shrimp dumplings were tasty and plump, and both noodle soups had great broths and noodles. The eggplants were especially delicious.

Why a three? Though the food was tasty, I JUST found out that restaurant.com offered a coupon for the Noodle Shop... SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW. Don't make the mistake I made -- retrieve a gift card from restaurant.com before you go here!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but nothing special. The service was adequate. I had a noodle dish with beef and duck, and the noodles had an unappetizing slimy feel to them. The duck was good, but the portion was very small. They charge $2.50 per person for hot tea, which I thought was a little much, and everything on the menu is $13 or more. For the quality and portion sizes, I'd expect them to charge half the price. On the plus side, the place was cute and well lit and it was easy to forget you were in a casino."}
{"text":"The food here sucks. Everyone in our party had a stomachache after eating here. The pho was disgusting. Instant wonton noodles are better than the stuff they serve at this restaurant. The Mongolian beef was mostly onions and the meat was still raw. Service was not good. One person had to wait 20 minutes for his food after the rest of us got our food. Do not go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was a little bland and plain looking but I'm glad they had soy sauce and I was too hungry to care. Lol"}
{"text":"Panda Express has better quality food than this place!  The kung pao chicken has peanuts sprinkles on top of it instead of being cooked in the dish...it looked like someone sprinkled the peanuts straight out of the jar!  Our second dish, was a sad case of Chow Mein.  I wouldn't recommend eating here unless your super drunk and have lots of money to blow."}
{"text":"The only reason that I give one star is about the environment. The dishes here are not good at all. There are either too salty or sweet. Their menu looks quite limted. Not recommend"}
{"text":"Should have checked Yelp first. Service was great but food was yucky. Ordered BBQ pork and it was hot, and Kung Pao Chicken and Chow Mein were over sauced. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment.  36.00 for a piece of fish not even cooked asian or any asian style.  Stay away"}
{"text":"The price is very high but the quality of the food is deeply unsatisfying.we ordered Yangzhou fried rice and their special fried rice. They tasted the same. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Yeah ummmm. Totally didn't read the reviews before going in here today, and was expecting a bit more flavor from this place.

Got the roast pork (cha chiu), Chinese broccoli  and steamed rice.  Well, I got it like 35 minutes after I ordered it.....

I was kinda pumped to see they had some of my favorites, but I have to say it was pretty bland.  The cha ciu was not sweet enough, and there was little-to-no brown sauce to add flavor. The Chinese broccoli was blanched properly, and had a drizzling of oyster sauce on it----but that only gives flavor to the lucky broccoli that got the sauce.

Again, if you are in need of a real Chinese fix, this joint isn't the top choice.  Head over to the Spring Mountain Rd area..."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for this place .. it's expensive for what it is but esp when drinking and gambling love this place ! We go every year . Won Ton noodle soup good .. Mabo tofu Chinese broccoli salt and pepper prawns and fried rice yummy and our favs 
When you get your $50 resort credit as a deal use it for here"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the designer's touch and the great service. You're here for the food and the food is mediocre at best.

Orange Peel Chicken: we asked to substitute chicken for beef. What did they do? Threw a bunch of breaded chicken in a beef sauce. Imagine putting chicken in your mouth and tasting beef.

Kung Pao Chicken was way sour and dulled down.

Cury Crab Potstickers were good.

Overall, a mediocre meal for $60. Keep walking. There are better places at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"This was just okay. Nothing we ordered was bad, but it was a bit overpriced. Okay, I know that should not be surprising in Vegas, but the environment was sparsley decorated, no real vibe of any sort at all. Bowls of soup were like $10. I guess I am used to the hard core authentic places that give you awesome food for giveaway prices.  

Wonton soup was fine. Nothing here nor there. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ?select=bc-yxdm0IHKl6nonLzfwpw

Seaweed salad was again fine. Standard. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ?select=QCkc2BuIX6v5Pq17ia_x1w

Pan Fried Dumplings were good. Nothing great, but good.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ?select=Dw-0ZFQtX-biYZj9ZKMAMA

It wasn't very Vegas festy inside. I think maybe if you have a hard core drunk craving for Chinese in your room and are willing to pay more than the usual price, this may be the answer, Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. Too many other cool places in Vegas to experience."}
{"text":"You would think this would be the perfect place to cure a hang over right? ...We were wrong... there was 10 of us and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for them to clear 2 tables for us. Once we were seated, we looked at the menu only to find the prices were pretty freakin nuts for the type of food this place offers. (ie. $20 for pho, $18 for pad thai, $18 for wonton noodle, $26 for wonton, scallop, pork, vegetable soup, $10 eggrolls, $4 for thai ice tea, etc **these aren't the exact prices but its around this price**).

After ordering our food, we had to wait about 15 minutes just to get our drinks. Had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food. I guess they wanted to serve us all at once so half of the food that came out was already cold or room temperature. Onto the food.... ABSOLUTELY the worst chinese/vietnamese/thai food we've ever had. Everything lacked flavor, meats and seafood was chewy, soup tasted water down, portions were kind of small for what you pay for, etc. I work and eat in downtown Oakland China Town all the time, and The Noodle Shop doesn't even compare to anything there.... Pho or wonton noodle soup is my hang over food, and this place just wanted to make me throw everything up.

This place was highly understaffed, and the cooks were slow.... My friends and I have already made complaints, so in the mean time...STAY CLEAR AWAY!!! You're better off walking 5 minutes away to McDonalds!"}
{"text":"$18 for a bowl of soup with a 1/2 pound of spagetti noodles, two thin slices of beef, a pinch of basil, a pinch of bean sprouts and a pinch of cilantro with a couple hot peppers.  Maybe it was because it was the end of my four days in Vegas and it gets tiring to be hammered with overpriced food day after day after day, but this was the final straw."}
{"text":"Quicky Review: overpriced basic chinese american dishes. Eat elsware. 

Ate lunch with the family. Do not get the pho. It is extremely bland and the noodle texture is stiff and not chewy. The pho costs double the price compared to back home, it takes 5 times longer to come out, yet it tastes like warm water with noddles. We also ordered orange chicken, mongolian beef, and garlic lobster. All the items were good but way to overpriced for simple dishes. There are so many delicious restaurants at the Mandalay Bay, steer clear of Noodle House"}
{"text":"Surprised to like the beef and noodles here, but service was a bit lacking and the food was overpriced.  Convenience was the buying driver in this case since I was staying at THEhotel and attending a convention at Mandalay Bay.  This is a lunch spot...no more."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food ever.
Wasted $25 for a single serving noodle.
Will never return."}
{"text":"Pei wei reject food at crazy prices. Mixed drink sucked beyond belief, not sure what they put in it. . DO NOT GO!!! Fried rice had no soy sauce. Their were 7 of us, and the food came out 5 minutes after we ordered. Everything is pre-made and it tasted like it."}
{"text":"What a rip off! I  have never been charged 15 bucks for a pot of Chinese tea . They need to state it on the menu.  Also, our dinner costs 70 bucks for a plate of noodles and a bowl of porridge.  I rather buy a cup of noodles."}
{"text":"service was great but the food quality...oh man! the pho i ordered was so tasteless i always finish my pho but could barely choke it down. the beef pieces were too thick...i suggest slicing them on the slicer thinner and if you cant, freeze the beef so that its easier to slice thinly. the pan fried shrimp and chive was good with the sauce. i wish i got the shrimp wonton noodle soup which my friend got. easier to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty good Asian food and I'm an Asian dude. I had the ramen which was tasty and I also tried the calamari, ma po tofu and pad Thai which were all good. The vegetable green curry was meh."}
{"text":"Service at The Noodle Shop was good, our server was very attentive. Servings are family style and the price is reasonable, we had order the typical.

Beef and Broccoli: delicious!!
Fried Rice: bland
Chow Mein: oily and bland"}
{"text":"This is probably a repeat of what most yelpers have said already, but this place is way too pricey for the quality of food.  I had the shrimp wonton soup, which wasn't bad, but wasn't mind-blowing either.  I also ordered the lychee martini which tasted like the juice that comes with canned lychee, and that was it, little to no alcohol content.  My sister had the chicken chow mein which she said was a little too salty.  My mother really liked her rice porridge, however, and I had a bite of the pan-seared dumpling that my other sister ordered which I found rather tasty.  Service was super-friendly though, couldn't fault them for that.  Still, I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great location in the Mandalay Bay...great ambience...however, the food is overpriced....and not that great. My friends and I shared Mongolian Beef and Fried Rice...we waited a good 20 minutes before our food arrived and I wasnt very impressed with the food. Had better Chinese food in a mall....."}
{"text":"Yelpers, thank you so much for your reviews because my husband had already redeemed a credit to use at this restaurant.$15 off $50 or more.   After reading your reviews and getting more and more horrified that our dinner is going to be an expensive disappointment, we decided to not order the noodle soups which was the target of most of the bad reviews. Instead we went with the      SEAFOOD STIR-FRY SUPREME
(Lobster, Scallops and Prawns) which we asked to be made spicy and the HOUSE SPECIAL CHOW MEIN (Shrimp, BBQ Pork, Chicken and Onions Wok-Fried with Soy Sauce).   Both turned out to be excellent.   We are both Chinese and believe me, I was ready to give a terrible review but we were pleasantly surprised with the food.  The service was great as well."}
{"text":"**Take out Review**
I hate to go against the grain, but I really enjoyed The Noodle Shop. My husband and I were in need for some comfort food, and for us, that's noodles. We ordered pad thai and Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles and Seafood to go. The staff was helpful and kind, they kept it short and sweet so that we could be on our way. We had to go take care of some business with the concierge and when we got back, our order was waiting for us. 
We took it up to the room and enjoyed our noodles and TV (as God intended). The pad Thai was fantastic, and I am fully aware that it could be because I was starving, but either way, I enjoyed it very much. Mr. R. finished his dish and even had some of mine. I appreciate the Noodle Shop for being different from the other casual fare offered at Mandalay Bay, sometimes you have to take less than desirable noodles in order to get noodles at all."}
{"text":"Drunk or not, the service is terrible. The attitude of Chinatown without the price or the authenticity or flavor. You'd do better at Raffles since the wait would be just as long but at least it's a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"Overpriced, not a friendly atmosphere at all. We ordered the shrimp wonton noodle soup. Soup was good. While ordering the waiter told us the soup was only enough for one person. It was enough for two adults actually. Thank goodness for our two kids we were able to order off the kids menu. We had the chicken fried rice and the chow mein- it was ok. Service is odd. The waiter only brought two soup bowls out when there were 4 of us at the table. The kids menu came with a drink and the staff only wanted to bring out one juice since they brought me a refill on my coke which I didn't ask for. Coke was 4 dollars. We asked them to bring out the two drinks since we had two kids and it came with the meal. At the end we asked for a to go container for the soup and they said they don't have any. So I guess if you order soup you can't take it to go? Weird. We just used our juice cup since the kids enjoyed the noodles and wanted it for later.  They gave us the kids menu which had coloring on it, but they only gave us one menu and  no crayons. 
 Some of the menu items are just outrageously priced. 
 Who pays 16.50 for fried rice and a lot of their single dishes like fish or beef were upwards of 24 dollars and up? 
  My kids did like the soup. The atmosphere and customer service of the staff is definitely lacking."}
{"text":"Over priced Asian food! I get it, it's a vacation spot and they have to price accordingly.

But hey at least make the food decent. I ordered a seafood stir fry with veggies and I think that was around $18 (yikes- really super high)

Thai ice tea was $4.50 - and I didn't order that.

Their Phou soup was priced supper high. I don't have a problem paying vacation prices, but it seriously was not that good. Greasy, salty and unsatisfied..........."}
{"text":"Before coming, we read the reviews. We should have listened. However, we were staying in Mandalay Bay and craving warm asian food, so we figured to give it a try- how bad could it be? 

We ordered the fried rice, beef chow run, and dim sum platter. To start off, everything is overpriced, but that is fairly typical on the strip. The fried rice was very bland. The beef chow fun was too salty. Nothing seemed to be going right.

Then, it got worse. We were told the dim sum sample platter for 2 would take 15 min to arrive. It took way longer. It consisted of 8 pieces shumai/ dumplings and 2 pork buns. For $30, I was expecting a bit more. To top it all, everything was disgusting. The dumplings were rubbery and everything else look liked it had been dyed with food coloring. After eating 2 pieces, we couldn't take it anymore and stopped. 

I've never had such a bad asian dining experience before. I didn't expect authentic food at a hotel in vegas, but I definitely never expected to encounter such a dining experience. Ever."}
{"text":"Both my friend and I got sick eatting here over the weekend.  Had a craving for some won ton noodles and I really didnt want to drive or catch a cab to go some place else.  Big mistake.  The broth was warm, the noodles were soggy and the won ton was barely cooked.  It's very expensive by the way.  You are looking at around 14 dollars for a bowl of noodles.  Sam woo in Spring mountain road is better if you are willing to catch a cab out there.  The wok at the mgm is cool too if you want to walk across to MGM.  Hate to say this but if I had to stay at the Mandalay Bay again, i might have to eat there again............I guess I won't be staying at the mandalay bay.........hahahaha.  If you would like to eat at a great authentic chinese restaurant off the strip.........try Joyful House."}
{"text":"Restaurant is overpriced and over rated, for the price that they charge for the food, you would figure that it would be at least decent, especially after a night in vegas. you want to get something good to eat. I found myself taking a cab the next day to Spring Mountain and found some real chinese food, at great prices."}
{"text":"I've been here a hundred million times. Literally.

They have really good food. I used to come here with the casino hosts from the Mandalay Bay, so we never 'did' lines. But, there are lines, there are tons of people who want to be here all the time, and the place is small. 

XO string beans. They have an asparagus thing that is pretty good. Their Pho is so-so. Eggplant is pretty good. Its all good. Its all very very expensive."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews for thus place. The food and service we received were incredible. I had the kung pao beef fillet medallions. The taste was so good, and the serving size was generous! My husband had the chicken fried rice, and that was so flavorful. Great place to dine!"}
{"text":"Everyone in our party said their food was 'good, but different.' The pad Thai was tasty, but orange-colored and more tomatoey than we've experienced. The orange chicken was bland and more crispy than anything. The fried rice rocked! The pho was good, but the beef in it was incorrigible -- tough and had to be cut on a plate, but a nice addition once added.

The service left something to be desired. Nice folks though."}
{"text":"Place sucks for Chinese food, u have been warned!!!
Pretty much everything is tasteless or doesn't taste like it should!"}
{"text":"The food is as bad as everyone one says. I only ate here because a friend that was staying at the Mandalay Bay was already here eating & invited us to come over from the Luxor next door and join them. I tried some of the beef bowl & the shrimp noodles, this was some of the blandest food I've ever had in my life. I didn't bother to try anything else they ordered since my friend said it was all pretty bad. Everything turn out pretty pricy too. We had about 3 or 4 orders of food & the bill was over $100.00. We should have just got on the tram to the Excalibar and got pix up stix from the food court."}
{"text":"Every time I have attempted to visit the Noodle Shop restaurant at the Mandalay Bay something has happened which prevented me from going. (E.g., Closed due to remodeling, closed due to water main break, closed due to stars alignment with Jupiter, etc..)  Anyway, I finally had a chance eat at the Noodle Shop and we weren't disappointed.

My daughter Muff, sister Luch and I were exhausted and broke after spending the day at the Fashion Show Mall.  We barely dragged ourselves back to the hotel and decided to eat before we went to our rooms. (We said that if we could make it to our rooms, we were NOT leaving.  And the previously checked out room service menu didn't strike our fancies.)
We perused the menu and here's what we ordered:
*  Shumai, 
*  Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork
*  Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce;
*  BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables

Only four dishes with rice and enough to feed a family of moose!  Everything was delicately flavored and wonderful.  I love garlic, but it can easily overpower any other flavor in its path.  It was present and accounted for in my Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce but not overly so.  My sister's Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork was also delicious.  And my daughter Muff's BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables was simple yet enchanting.  And the freshly made Shumai was delightful.
We had a scrumptious lovely meal to end our day of shopping madness."}
{"text":"I liked this place! What better way to nurse your hangover than a big bowl of pho or veggie chow mein? Service was quick  and friendly too.

Prices were a little steep, but this is on par for all other pricing at any of the restaurants in/near the Mandalay Bay.

I recommend it if you don't mind spending $20 on noodles."}
{"text":"This place had 2 stars at the time I ate here, and honestly, it's not that horrible. This is not the best place, but it is digestible. You want 4 or 5 star quality go elsewhere. 

My big complaint however is the price, I get that it's Vegas but 60 bucks for egg rolls, pork buns, a small wonton soup, and pad thai is a joke."}
{"text":"After a long night of partying, we were in desperate need of something warm or hot and comforting. What better cure for a hangover than Pho? We had a group of 12 and the people working there wanted to cram us into 2 TINY ass tables..... Are you kidding me?! We kindly requested to add an additional 3rd table... they gave us this dirty look wow.

Anyway, most of us got Pho, some of us got rice dishes and others some other noodle soup dish. The Pho was like $17?! What in the @#$%!! I anxiously waited for my Pho.... and it came 30 minutes later.... I do not know why it took them so long to slice up some beef, add the hot broth that should already be simmering in a huge pot, and some noodles.

The Pho wasn't even hot!!! It was lukewarm at best!! The beef wasn't even cooking thru!!! The whole bowl had like 4 slices of beef.... no meatballs, no tendons, no tripe. I didn't know you could mess up Pho, but this place did!

Suggestion: Don't come here. Bad and expensive food. Terrible service. Gah I'm still mad... I would've rather bet that money and lose it."}
{"text":"My party was seated very quickly because, well, the place was pretty damn empty. This was on Sunday around lunch time. Fortunately, the food came out quickly too. I ordered the sea bass congee, and it was pretty basic. A few green onions. Small sea bass pieces. No Chinese donut. No century egg. The problem here is the price. For what it is, way too much to recommend. The congee itself was fine but not spectacular enough to justify the price of $17+. Do not plan on coming back, but I do plan on having some better, cheaper congee soon."}
{"text":"Hostess was very friendly.

Great food at reasonable price. 

We got the broccoli oyster and Kung pao chicken.  Other meals were great and service was fantastic and fast. Request server Wai Q and you will not be disappointed (attentive, friendly, fast)

During the meal the manager, older gentlemen, came over twice to quickly ask how things were and continued on. We respect this at all restaurants. 

Would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Even after you read all the reviews and you're thinking to yourself, it can't be that bad... don't go.  

If my friends and I could give this zero stars, we would.  We're not sure we've ever had such a bad experience.  Ever.  

We ordered pad thai and the shrimp and asparagus - both were lackluster and tasted odd...even the plain white rice tasted smoked or burnt.  We couldn't decide.  

Even though it's inside Mandalay Bay, don't be fooled... it's hard to imagine how this place has stayed open as long as it has.  

I know this review is harsh, but it's truthful.  Find another place for dinner.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and been pretty pleased. I can think of places worth two stars but this is not one of them. The Singapore noodles are great, with generous amounts of shrimp and chicken. The shrimp were not at all fishy. The shrimp dumplings were plump with shrimp and also very nice. The BBQ pork with mixed vegetables was surprisingly good, very nice assortment of vegetables and a flavorful sauce. Service was fine, though the restaurant was not crowded and the lady with the mop should have waited till we left before mopping all around our table. I would go here again next time."}
{"text":"Terrible. The food was bland and low quality. If you're at Mandalay bay and hungry, keep walking. Plenty of good options close by."}
{"text":"Wow, waited 20 minutes for our order to be taken. Then got the food in 8 minutes with days old chicken and horrible noodles. My husband got the chicken fried rice but the rice was not fried. They should have just closed their doors tonight. Everyone was looking around in utter disguised. If you want to eat good Asian food, don't go to the noodle house"}
{"text":"Had dim sum sampler for 2, seaweed salad, BBQ pork noodle soup.
It was just a sponteneous lunch at Mandaley. 
Price was not cheap either (we paid about $60).  Will go Chinatown next time."}
{"text":"Just awful. Really really bad. We had dim sum for two. 26$. Thought would be decent amount of food. I am not lying when I say not only was it buffet quality food but tiny portions. The dim sum was ok some BBQ. The rest. Boring plain and no sauce except soy. Just 200% over priced!!!!

Wonton soup. Omg. I LOVE wonton soup. This was terrible. Fishy broth and mystery meat. I asked manager if it was fish broth and he said no. Chicken. Scared to eat it. Not kidding. Smelled like the Gulf of Mexico. Turned my stomach. I love ocean smell of salty air and fish but not in my chicken broth!!! My husband had a signature Chow Mein. Tasteless. Utterly bland. People, this was buffet quality, but worse. 

Now as I write this, I'm still in the restaurant. The waiter was kind and sweet, front manager VERY VERY attentive. This was something Kitchen related. Food MUST be revamped into Great Asian food to redeem themselves. I have a very hard time believing that Mandalay Bay is ok with this. FIX IT. I DO NOT return food. I will however tell a manager why I did not eat the food. And we did NOT eat the food (we did eat dim sum but not entrees). He seemed upset we didn't let him make something new. We don't do that. We just do not. It was all not good so what was the point? Was it suddenly going to become great?  I had a myvegas 15$ discount and after complaining manager took 10$ off. Our bill for inedible food was still nearly 60$ (with tip) for two. No alcohol. And no food to speak of consumed. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"This was a frustrating and not so tasty dining experience. 

We are at Mandalay, and I was overcome with a craving for noodles. The obvious choice (without doing the smart thing and jumping on the 15 and heading to Spring Mountain) was The Noodle Shop.

We were seated quickly, but it took quite some time for our waiter to take our order. When he arrived, we wanted his suggestions for the best noodles. He recommended a XO Vietnamese noodle with shrimp, the most expensive noodle. My husband warned me that the waiter was just trying to up sell the pricey dish. Regardless, it didn't sound too appealing to me, when our waiter returned, I went with the Singapore curry noodle. I wanted to get tofu instead of shrimp, but our waiter said it would be $2 extra! Sorry, but that is unacceptable. If I am not getting shrimp, there should not be an upcharge for tofu. So, I went with shrimp even though I wasn't planning on eating them. 

My husband ordered the $26 Vietnamese noodle with shrimp. That's right. He ordered the thing he had warned me against. Crazy husband.

My curry noodles were edible, but over curried (this coming from a die hard curry addict) and they were lacking that seasoned wok flavor. 

My husband's dish was sad. The portion was teeny, and the jumbo shrimp were no larger than the standard shrimp at Red Lobster. The flavor was just eh. He was so disappointed that he called over the manager and told her they should take the dish off the menu (true, but I was still embarrassed!). When he asked why in the world this dish was $26, she said it was the XO. For $26, my husband should have at least gotten tipsy off the noodles. He didn't. I am generally okay with a Strip premium, but this was unacceptable for a pretty casual dining experience with mediocre flavor and sub par service.  

My visions of a happy, noodle filled belly were squashed. Sorry, Noodle Shop, but there were just too many issues."}
{"text":"Rude waiters. Guy with the squeaky voice and bowl haircut gave me an attitude when I ordered takeout and then the food wasn't even hot when I got to my room. They also didn't pack soy sauce. 

The Singapore noodles ended up causing me to throw up. I think the shrimp was bad. 

Don't eat here. It's not a convenience and you'll hate yourself when you wasted money on an overpriced casino restaurant that makes Panda Express look like the French Laundry."}
{"text":"Bland soup. Spicy means it has garlic. Overall overpriced and not recommended. So sorry I hate submitting poor reviews."}
{"text":"This negative review does not apply to all the waitress here in this Restuarant.. The waitress that was serving us was not very friendly, he actually had an attitude with me and my boyfriend when we're ordering food. Never coming back here EVER again!
Bad Service!."}
{"text":"Way too over-priced for a not-so-great bowl of pho. The pho was bland and not worth $16. The duck noodle soup wasn't great either. The duck was on the dry side. I will never coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I still like this lil Hidden hawaiian joint in the CAli hotel.  It's not fancy but the food is hearty and tasteful enough to make you feel like you're eating authentic hawaiian food.  We typically order the Saimwn, daily special, and musubi!"}
{"text":"My plate of chicken chow mein noodles were: noodles and onions. Oh, and like 4 or 5 bland white kinda boiled pieces of chicken. For more than $20 what I wouldn't mind if it were a real chicken chow mein. 
Unbelievable all the floss in this 5 stars $$$$ Hotel!
See the picture."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience.  Singapore noodles were the worst i have had. Prices were stupid for quality."}
{"text":"Should've listened to yelp reviews. This place is overpriced mediocre food restaurant. 

Tonkatsu ramen had 3 fatty chunks of meat we couldnt eat, watery broth, little bitty of green onions and nothing else. 

Dimsum for 2. DO NOT GET THIS. Comes out with 2 pieces of shumai, 2 pieces of shrimp dumplings, 1 leaf sticky rice, 2 meat humbaos. This is for 1 person, not for 2 people!! Not worth $30. This should be like $10. 

Don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"It turns out Mandalay Bay has pretty much eliminated their room service. So wanting something quick after a long day of working, I ventured in. Of course I read the Yelp reviews after I had been seated and was really nervous that I had made a poor choice.

I decided to go with simple menu items (how can they screw those ones up?) and avoided all the ones that were specifically reviewed as bad.

I went with the chicken satay to start and the Thai curry chicken as an entree. The chicken satay came out and was ok. The peanut sauce it was served with tasted more of taco seasoning (your guess is as good as mine on why) and was not a nice creamy peanut sauce. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.

The Thai curry chicken was a generous portion. The chicken was a strange texture (boiled, maybe?) but tasted ok. The red and green peppers with it were fresh and pretty crispy still. The sauce had some yellow curry in it but not quite enough. The flavor was weak but the spice level was strong. The dish was ok. Not great and not terrible.

All in all, I probably wouldn't eat here again but it's not quite as bad as some of the other Yelp reviews -- at least not with my experience tonight."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. Great service, but horrible food. Please don't spend your time and money at this place."}
{"text":"Had the Young Chow Fried Rice which was alright.  The pieces of BBQ Pork could have been larger and tastier.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"Good for a late night bite if you are in the mood for Asian.  I thought the service was fast and pretty upscale considering a diner like setup.  Food tasted good but no it will not be any kind of healthy so hit the gym in the morning after your late night bite here!"}
{"text":"We should have checked the Yelp reviews before we went to The Noodle Shop at Mandalay Bay.   It is absolutely terrible.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  

We ordered the \"Roasted Crispy Duck\" appetizer and was told that it actually wasn't crispy, but just roasted.  We got it anyway and it was disgusting.  The taste was lousy and it was some of the worst duck I've ever had.  

We also ordered the Cashew Chicken.  Our waitress came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and told us they were out of cashews, but they would make it without cashews.  Are you kidding me?  They ran out of cashews?

Our waitress was awful.  She was extremely annoying and her manager wasn't any better, as she seemed about as clueless as the waitress.  

I give you all the same advise I told people looking at the menu when we were leaving: this place is terrible.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Inside the Mandalay Bay. If you're looking for a hangover cure.. this isn't it.

Wonton noodle soup- 2/5. I suppose this may be relatively good here? Noodles are hard and soup is generic and MSG tasting.

Thousand year old egg porridge- 2/5. Bland once again with small portion of thousand year old egg and a measly small sprinkle of green onions.

Mongolian Beef- 1/5. More like elementary school 'mystery meat mondays' for $20.

Lettuce mince meat wrap- 3/5. Okay tasting but small portions, more like a small appetizer. 

High priced, but then again you are in Vegas so that's to be expected. But the quality is not good. It's much more worth it to drag yourself to a Pho place off the strip to cure that hangover."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0.00. It was not great, overpriced (26.00 for a very small entree and cup of streamed rice.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"Just ate at the Noodle Shop a few hours ago and everything was great! Being Chinese myself, I know what authentic Chinese food is, and this isn't it.  It's comparable to a PF Changs, maybe.  

I would probably never pay full price to eat here, I had a restaurant.com coupon that I used to get $25 off.  We had the sweet and sour chicken and the mongolian beef.  Both plates were solid and tasty.  Portions are just right and respective sauces were good.  

At the end of the meal, what was supposed to be a $40 meal after taxes and tip, came out to $15.  I felt a little bad since service was great, so I just tipped a bit more.  

I will probably be back next time I'm in Vegas, but i will be coming armed with a coupon."}
{"text":"This place was alright. There's not very much special about this place. It was the last minute lets go before it was close at 1130pm meal when the good restaurant was closed on the strip and every one from my party wanted noodles soup. Thai tea was watered down. The only thing good was the pho. Every thing else was bland. 

What was on the menu: 
Vietnamese beef pho
Curry fried noodles 
Duck noodles soup"}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend wasting your precious time in Vegas by eating at this restaurant.  Not only are portions small,  the manager at the particular moment was not customer friendly & tried to give someone else's business card when I asked for hers. If this is her name, Yvonne Chow. SO UNTRUSTWORTHY. I Can honestly say I've never experienced anything like that before.  Unapologetic & rigid. What happened to customer service?  Doesn't exist here! I Wouldn't Expect This at Mandalay,  where we come each time we visit Las Vegas. NO STARS!!!"}
{"text":"This was a lovely little place!

The service was wonderful - very, very friendly waiter. 

Food was really good too. I had sweet and sour chicken which was better than your average American-Chinese stuff. 

The pricing was exactly what I would expect from a similar hotel casual dining restaurant in Vegas - definitely no surprise there.

I'd definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Spectacular in all aspects. Great Hot and Sour soup. Great Vegetable Egg Rolls (and mustard sauce and sweet and sour sauce)!  The Scallops and Snow Peas were to die for. I always find scallops to be unpredictable. (At worst, rubbery.). These scallops were tender and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. Table service was white cloth napkin and I thought it was above the \"casual dining\" it had been described as. We'll be happy to return."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a casual/quick lunch. Food was great. Flavor was great. Ambiance and decor was really good. Price was more than what you would expect for a casual spot but not outrageous (~$20 per person). Service is good too. Again, good spot for quick lunch away from the hustle and bustle"}
{"text":"I love ramen. Their ramen is not even close to what ramen should be. Soup is not creamy and not at all tasty. I believe it's not flavored enough and it's like a Chinese noodle soup, with simply clear broth with a little chopped  mushroom, scallions and bamboo shoots! It wasn't really special. The place looks nice but it's seems it's just a facade. I got frustrated there was nothing special with their food. And their servers too! They  seems to lack courtesy and We felt like I'm we were market place while dining. There were lots of shouting and sluggish  movement by their servers. There was even someone using a broom and a pan cleaning around the dining hall while we were there eating! Disgusting! I started to question why would Mandalay Bay have to have such a mediocre Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was good as you expect in Casino.

Price was high but it is in Casino.

Service was bad. It looked only a few servers including a manager tried to cover all, they looked overwhelmed. Everything was delayed. The bill they gave us at last didn't contain a customer copy.

So interesting to see in such business the middle aged manager took care of a bunch of junior cheer leaders to set up their table covers individually.

A short evaluation: they need to hire more people."}
{"text":"I don't understand how it survived this far and I regretted for taking a chance despite its low ratings on Yelp.

We ordered 4 dishes which cost almost the same as two dinner buffets but all of them were so disappointing that I left hungry. They were overly salty without the right flavors. Even Panda Express makes better Chinese food in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was out with the family and I was very disappointed. The service was substandard. I live in Nevada. People ask me for my recommendations all the time. Noodle Shop needs to remind their servers that people come to Vegas to have a great time and want great service. I am retired and I have a lot of time on my hands. I love to eat out. Sorry Noodle Shop. I shall not return."}
{"text":"Despite peeking at the reviews beforehand, my family and I went to the Noodle Shop since we wanted something light (after having buffet and steak the 24 hrs prior). We were promptly brought to a table. A lady took our drink order, but seemed to be a bit impatient when my dad didn't decide what drink he wanted right away. All of us ended up ordering different things and only my sister was pleased with her dish (seared sea bass), though she was the one who refused to go after I told her about the subpar reviews. My dish had crispy noodles and seafood. It was bland and the texture was sort of uneven (?). My mom's Vietnamese noodle soup was bland and my dad's Pad Thai had no sauce. The Thai tea was good and the service was kind."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has become an expensive place to eat. When you combine expensive with bad quality you have the Noodle shop. I'm not going to write much. They don't deserve it. Poor quality dished up as a lump of congealed noodles in bad broth."}
{"text":"From the moment we were seated, we felt like we were an intrusion for the people working even though it was not very busy. They made our order wrong and the food was just ok. Also, the menu is a mix of dishes - it isn't really a 'noodle' restaurant."}
{"text":"How can you make something like Pho taste like hot water and still have the nerve to call it Pho?!  When you're in Vegas you need something brothy to bring you back to life and this stuff just made it worse.  I even had to go down to pick it up because they don't deliver AND it's EXPENSIVE!  

Tried the bbq pork noodle dish too and that was a huge disappointment!  

I've said this before but seriously how are you still in business?!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Ok, dined here last night for the third time in 2 years. Sorry Mandalay Bay but the Noodle Shop is just terrible and horribly overpriced. I swear the chefs have no idea what chinese and thai food is supposed to taste like. If I buy an asian cookbook can I open a restaurant?  Seriously, for the third time the pad thai was a wattery soup that tasted like jiffy peanut butter.  The lettuce wraps had absolutly NO seasoning or flavor. The mu shu duck was fair but the pancake was so dry it just crumbled upon folding. Why is this place soooooo bad yet stays alive. If you think panda express is great asian food you will still be utterly disappointed! There are so many great noodle shops in Vegas that are traditional, delicious,  and less expensive, try the one in the back corner of the Venetian!

By the way, I was sober every time I've eaten here.

Do not waste your money or one good evening in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here, starving, after unnecessarily fasting for over 15 hours (oh laziness, what you can do to a girl) I came here, STARVING. 
I was unpleasantly greeted with a line, however, I was delirious due to hunger so I waited. (I did notice like, 5 empty tables waiting for seats, but the this place was REALLY understaffed) 
I sat and ordered Thousand year old egg with shredded pork congee. My mother ordered wonton mein, and my sister ordered... pot stickers? 
This place was a mix of different kinds of asian cuisine, I managed to find a red bean beverage and pad thai (not chinese food) So this place could be your fix for all sorts of asian cuisine.
The staff understood cantonese, so they're authentic and my entree seemed legit. The congee was super flavorful but it was WAY thick... I'm not saying I like watery congee, but this was like pudding thick. Anyways, the pork was a tad salty, but overall, the congee was really good.
My mom seemed content (not stoked) about her wonton mein and my sisters pot stickers looked like fried sui mai. 
or not pot stickers of any sort, to be honest.

I liked this place a lot, if the service was better, I'd consider coming back within the same trip.. maybe, the price was very off putting though."}
{"text":"Walk away while you can.

Went to Vegas for a bachelor party and statyed at The Hotel at the Mandalay. After checking in my boy's and I needed a quick fix and wanted something quick and cheap, which we could not find at the hotel. So we ended up at the noodle shop. 

Long story short, the food was okay and we paid  around $11 for effing soup that was just blah. We were still hungry and ordered the combination fried rice which was $12 blah, but for $12 I was expecting a mountain full of rice. Instead we got a speed bump of rice. 

Overall this place was an overall bust, that placed $25 in my pocket. If you can't find anything to eat at the Mandalay that's quick and cheap I recommend walking a little further to the Luxor or go to the Cafe."}
{"text":"Saw that there were some mixed reviews for the place on Yelp but I was staying at the Mandalay and needed some food.  I was a bit disappointed in the Noodle shop.  The staff was a bit brusque and slow at times.  I felt that the service was extremely slow for an afternoon late lunch with a near empty restaurant while several staff members present.  Figured that the authentic service would be a good sign, but alas I was in for a disappointment.

The food was average chinese food that I could get in Delaware, which if you have read my posts before that is a very low bar.  I ended up getting the chicken lettuce cups as an appetizer and the Hong Kong style noodles with seafood.

The chicken filling was well made with a nice mild sweetness it.  The water chestnuts were chopped and crisp.  As a difference there was some pine nuts mixed in which was a nice crunch and flavor.  Chicken was moderate, but nothing special.  Disappointingly the dish came with only 3 leaves of lettuce for the dish, much too few.  The other problem was that they served it with ROMAINE lettuce, not much of a cup or able to wrap it up.  Poor choice of lettuce type.

Hong Kong style noodles were not freshly made, they were standard type thick noodles.  Not exactly pasty but pretty close.  The fish in the seafood was cold and flat tasting with a bit of gristle.  The shrimp was well seasoned and prepared but that was the only highlight of the dish.  Overall the dish was a bit oily and disappointing.

While I understand that the food would be a bit more expensive because of the location in the casino it was way overpriced considering the quality of the food.  The dishes were of low quality compared to what I would expect at Vegas in a casino.  I avoided this place during the remainder of my trip and would not return."}
{"text":"Yummy Singapore Noodles and pork dumplings. I love the little hot sauces they have on the table too, great for mixing with rice/noodles/ etc.
SUPER friendly service. Expensive -sure but still cheaper than the main restaurants! 
Save the money - don't eat at Shanghai Lilly -just eat at the Noodle Shop!"}
{"text":"If you know Chinese food then keep on walking. Way overpriced for food that's not even as good as Panda Express."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. We ordered the Malaysian Laksa Noodle soup ($21) and Tonkotsu ramen ($17). Completely flavorless. The Laksa supposedly came with assorted seafood. Apparently that consisted of two shrimps, fish cakes, and fish balls. The ramen did not come with an egg and the pork was extremely fat. What a rip off."}
{"text":"I was invited to have dinner with my BFF and his family. It was my BFF's parent's fave place to eat, so we decided to give it a try. All I wanted was noodles. I was impressed with the ambiance, but then I thought to myself, this must be expensive chinese food to be this nice! 

The restaurant is spacious and I was surprised there was a lot of people dining here. We were led to a table, and our drinks were provided. I ordered the house special chow mein to share. When I received it, the noodles looked good, but the taste was lackluster. I had to add soy sauce to provide more flavor to the noodles. 

I didn't try the other items we ordered because I was craving noodles. My entree did its job filling me up, but disappointed the noodles lacked in flavor."}
{"text":"Came here cause my parents claimed that this is their favorite place to eat. It's a fairly small restaurant, but it wasn't that busy when we got there. We were seated immediately. We wanted to review the menu a bit before ordering. So they provided us with the water we asked for, but it took them some time till someone returned to take our order.

We decided to order the house special chow mein, BBQ combination platter, and the tonkatsu. I wasn't impressed at all with chow mein. It was bland and the noodles very wet. The BBQ combination platter had pork and duck meats. The flavor was very mild. Then there was the tonkatsu. Ramen is one of my favorite foods and I go to ramen bars regularly. This ramen was like your typical $1 Top Ramen. The broth wasn't the creamy pork broth. But the chasu was pretty good and a fair serving size. 

We had then waited for some time till we finally had tinhaik down the staff for our check. Food and service, not worth coming back to again. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Reccomend Pho soup! Not with the beef it comes with though, that meat was disgusting! Minus the meat it was Amazing.. Mongolian beef was great as well! I felt the plates were pricey for being very casual dIning, also didn't serve you that much Meat. 
Great service, friendly & upbeat! Would reccomend!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch menu for $19.  The Kung Pao Chicken was excellent (and I eat at a lot of non-Americanized Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"We ordered the same menu as the day before yesterday. However, despite the same menu, there was only one vegetable. When we showed pictures, they added vegetables."}
{"text":"I wanted something warm and soupy so I had ordered the pho noodle soup (I figured they couldn't mess that one up even though it was a Chinese restaurant). The soup was lukewarm, noodles were not pho noodles and the thick slabs of beef were impossible to chew through. It was overpriced, bad food that gave me a stomachache right after."}
{"text":"Noodle House at the Mandalay Bay. 

Exactly what you'd expect from a Chinese Noodle House.

Price: Cheap.
Food: Will satisfy most.
Servings: More than enough for one, unless you always eat supersized meals.
Presentation: Nothing fancy, just straight out good food.
Taste: We've ordered a few of their dishes and no bad words were spoken, well except that their China tea which cost like a mother... The beef tenderloin noodle i had was delicious. 
Wait: It was fast, our food was served in the nick of time after we ordered, like fast food, except the food tasted better than we expected. 

Not a fan of noodle houses though. This place ain't that bad if you're craving for hot soup after getting buzzed."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible quality food. 

Ordered cashew chicken and received chicken and macadamia nuts. 

Everything was bland and overpriced. 

Panda Express is leagues better.

Avoid!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for noodles so we ate at The Noodle Shop for dinner.

We ordered:

- 2 meat BBQ Appetizer - Duck and Pork - the pork was a bit tough and the duck was pretty good
- Beef Stew Noodle Soup - I liked the beef stew noodle soup - the noodle was al dente; the broth was good; the beef chunks were tender and there was some tendon and Shanghai Bok Choy  as well;  
- Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup - Good wontons and good broth
- Beef Chow Fun - smaller than usual portion 
- BBQ Pork Noodle Soup 
- Choy Sum with Oyster Sauce 

Wait staff was attentive.

It was an OK dinner.  Not sure If I'll come back."}
{"text":"We thought it was great that we found a Noodle place inside, so we wouldn't have to drive the Strip, but Big mistake! The calamari came out breaded, fluffy, not really crispy, and lacked that flavor. I'm guessing the Ramen needed to be cooked longer, because the noodles were still slightly hard, and not the Ramen flavor. We should've taken the Drive..."}
{"text":"Food here....yuck!  I ordered the seafood soup which tasted bland, others ordered the pho, Mongolian beef, etc, and all seemed like it was missing something.  Not talking about MSG, but it seems they didn't even bother to taste or season well the food.  And to compound our wonderful excursion, the waitress when giving the bill said, \"Don't forget to leave tip!\"  I usually leave more than 20% when I eat out, this time, she doesn't even deserve half that!

In summary, yucky food, high not worth prices, and rude service.  A must skip if ever in the Mandalay Bay Hotel!"}
{"text":"Yes it's ridiculous to pay these prices for noodles.  But you know what, it's the middle of the night, you didn't think twice about the price you're paying to be staying at Mandalay Bay, and you want comfort food.  Pho, congee, pad thai, whatever your craving is after a long night.  This is it, lots of variety and be realistic - it's as authentic as you're going to find in a casino hotel.  Relax, think of it as your little oasis in Vegas.  Enjoy it; you'll win big tomorrow! Right?"}
{"text":"Around the Excalibur-Luxor-Mandalay Bay corridor, your Asian food options are quite limited. I have to say that Noodle Shop was actually an ok place even though you are paying 2x to 3x more for Asian cuisine. You are definitely paying for the convenience, but it definitely hits the spot after a long night of partying. I had the roasted duck noodle soup and the preserved egg congee. The roasted duck noodle soup was pretty good, although after a while, you notice the heavy presence of salt. So, after I tasted too much salt, I tried to tame the salt with a bowl of congee. The congee wasn't good at all. I had to douse my congee with pepper to make it taste better which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food and the xo noodles are terrific.  The duck was very good.  All the soups are great!!"}
{"text":"I learned the valuable lesson of what happens when you don't yelp a restaurant when traveling.. The Noodle Shop was utter crap... Overpriced and seriously mediocre.. I passed by the place and it looked  decent and it was jam packed with smiling Asian folks... I thought that was a good sign.., but boy was I wrong... I tried the seaweed salad with deep fried tofu, seafood wonton soup, and roasted duck/ BBQ pork combo.. The BBQ pork was decent but only had about four bites with the serving.. Totally overpriced $18.... The ice teas were like $4 bucks and of course 
you gave to pay for a \"small\" side of steamed rice... The rice was actually worth it's price tag, but really \"how do you f$*k up rice\"... If you have a need to waste money and torture you're taste-buds then the Noodle Shop will not disappoint...
* gave this place a second star  because the service was good despite it being packed...."}
{"text":"One of the worst Chinese restaurants I've been to. The waiter recommends chicken chow mein saying it's full of vegetables ,only to find out onions is what he was referring to as vegetable. When asked , he says additional vegetables is going to cost you more!!  . Chicken fried rice is more like white rice with chicken."}
{"text":"If you are like me, you are reading this review as you sit at this restaurant wondering why everything is so awful. You may be wondering why an experienced yelper like myself would be checking reviews AFTER they are already eating somewhere. First, every other restaurant had a long wait. I was REALLY hungry, hubby wasn't feeling well and just wanted to get me fed so we could head up to the room. The empty restaurant should have been a sign, but I went for it because how much can you screw up noodles? Reception is always tough in casinos, so I didn't even try to check reviews. 

I ordered Pad Thai, my husband ordered wonton soup. I'm not sure I even can even use words to describe how seriously awful the Pad Thai was. If I was blind folded I don't know that I would even know it was Pad Thai. My guess would be that it was leftover noodles from a chafing dish at a 10 year reunion the night before. The flavor was awful, the texture bizarre, as hungry as I was I could not even make myself choke this down. My husband's soup was almost edible if you avoided the wonton. So basically the broth was bland enough to force it down your throat in a pinch.

I so very rarely send food back, but this was inedible and expensive to boot! I kept trying to flag a server down, finally after 10+ minutes I went up to the hostess and said I needed either a manager or my server. When the server came over I started to explain why I didn't like it. He didn't seem surprised at all, just took it away and asked if I wanted something else. I decided not to subject myself to anything else from this place. We paid for the soup and then headed over to a small souvenir shop in the hotel. We grabbed a bag of pretzels and called it a night. Those Rold Gold pretzels were AMAZING after the slop we'd had here.

I don't think there is anything you could do to get me to eat here again. Even if it was free! Even if I was hungry and given the option of this or nothing, I think I would choose nothing every time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! Mandalay Bay should close this place down and open a good noodle place. Noodles are awesome when you have had a little too much Vegas fun, and even if the noodles were just average I think it would do very well! If you saw a picture of how tired this place looks, you would not even think this would be open inside Mandalay Bay. This place needs to go!"}
{"text":"Really horrible Asian food in Mandalay Bay, right next to the casino.  I ate there once and didn't go back."}
{"text":"I cannot for the life of me fathom how such an overpriced restaurant with less than mediocre food and SLOW service has succeeded here in the Mandalay Bay. 2 beers, a flavorless dim sum sampler for 2, and a very fatty, poor quality pork belly bao appetizer results in a $65 bill? VERY small portions. Staff were also unbelievably rude to the hostess, who was about the only one genuinely trying to accommodate guests. Come here again? GTFOH..."}
{"text":"I visit the Noodle Shop at least once every time I go to Vegas. It's fast, easy and convenient.

I really like the curried Singapore Noodles here and order it every time! The pork and shrimp in the dish are delicious.  The moo shoo duck appetizer is ok and their honey bbq pork noodle soup is just ok too, I'd suggest sticking to the Singapore Noodles they're my favorite! 

If you're looking for a more formal sit down, full service experience go to Shanghai Lily or China Grill. The Noodle Shop is good for a quick casual meal."}
