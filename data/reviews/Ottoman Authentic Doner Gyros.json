{"text":"I am sorry but this place is a joke. They should remove \"Doner\" from there name. I have had real doner before and this place is not even close"}
{"text":"This is the worst shawarma place in the city. The pita is dry, nothing stays in the wrap, and the salad is just a pile of old lettuce. Went here twice, the second time I came to give it a second chance after the first time was terrible but they were awful 2 times. Don't waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, because we never got any. We did, however, have quite the experience with the staff.  We ordered for delivery and left clear instructions (Attic apartment, please go up the fire escape at the back of the house) and were sitting near the front door. We heard a car honking its horn persistently outside- note, this was late at night in a residential area.   My boyfriend went downstairs to see what was happening and was verbally abused by the driver, who said he had knocked ten times (clearly he had not) and told my boyfriend he was a \"f*cking liar\". When he tried to pay for the food, the driver drove off, taking it with him.  We called in to speak to the manager, and to see if we could get our food, and were told they would call the driver- we never heard back.  It gets better...  We decided to try another place listed on Just Eat. Half an hour after ordering, I get a call saying the only vegetarian option they had was the grape leaves and our food would arrive within thirty minutes. An hour and a half later, starving, we call back to see when our food would arrive, and I was told that I hadn't placed an order. Then he said I had ordered twice. Finally, he literally screamed at me to shut up, and slammed the phone down. Turns out, it was the same driver and same establishment under a different name (Greek in the Village).  Definitely the most unpleasant experience I've had- here in Toronto or at home in England."}
{"text":"I popped into this place on a sunny afternoon and it was empty. I paid at least $8.00 (I tipped!) for chicken on a greek salad. Waving a cheery goodbye, I ran home, my mouth watering with the expectation of a flavorful dinner. I opened the box. I found three bites of chicken. Three bites of chicken? I poked around. Yep, three bites. A little stingy, but it must be amazing, I reasoned. I chewed. The chicken was dry! $8.00? For three pieces of chicken? Dry chicken? No. There is good Greek food to be had in this neighborhood. From now on I will go (and recommend!) elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordering from this restaurant was an absolute nightmare. I made a yelp account to specifically complain about the service I received from this place. After ordering from The Ottoman, I didn't get my food, so I cannot comment on its taste. The food may be terrible, but I'm sure it could not be as bad as the staff that is employed there. Instead of following the instructions listed on how to reach the apartment I was in, their delivery driver opted of the super rational route of honking rudely to gain my attention (at 10pm or so). When I came down to see what was up, the driver began to tell me how he had knocked ten times on my door (which isn't true, my girlfriend and I were waiting by the door of the apartment and heard nothing). After telling him I didn't hear anything, he began to call me a \"fucking liar\". Now, I'm not saying that he didn't knock on a door ten times, but he certainly didn't knock on mine ten times. I mean, what sort of person who ORDERS the food and WANTS the food ignores it when its at the door. After being insulted, I still offered to pay for the food but was called a fucking liar once more and drove off with the food. We then called the restaurant, to ask to speak to the manager. We asked about getting our food and we told that they would call the driver and get back to us. Of course, they never did. Once my girlfriend and I had regrouped from this terrible experience, we decided to order from another place called \"Greek in the Village\", also located on Bloor Street. After putting in our order online, we were called back and informed that they could not fulfill our order of friend eggplant slices, but could give us stuffed grape leaves instead. We then waited. And waited. And waited. An hour and a half later my girlfriend called the restaurant. She was met on the phone by the rudest staff member imaginable. He first asked her what she wanted to order. She told him that she didn't have an order, but a complaint. He then told her that she never placed an order here before. Next, she was told that she placed an order twice. He then screamed at her to shut up and hung up the phone. After doing a bit of digging online, my girlfriend and I have found out that these two restaurants are the same restaurants but listed under two different names (we assume to gain more business online). The entire ordeal took a total for three hours."}
{"text":"I had the Halifax style donair and my friend had the ottoman doner with they put fries inside. They also sell Greek food . You'll try once and your hooked:))) Finally something other than asian food.  They open around11:00am and close at 2:30 am  I love this place:)))))"}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered delivery from here, everything was pretty bad. Hummus was the worst Ive ever had. Delivery took 90mins.. Never again.."}
{"text":"Got a delivery from here tonight. Really wish could give it no stars and had read reviews first.  Firstly to get delivery you need to order over 40 dollars worth, which is a bit annoying. But liked the sound of the food, a lot of Turkish veggi food. We ordered the fried egg plant dinner plate ( comes with rice potatoes salad and pita) and a lamb ottoman gyro. Also got hummus as side. It's honestly the first meal I and my husband have ever had that neither of us could eat any of it. It was absolutely terrible, ever single bit. Nothing was edible- I honestly don't know how they could even cook rice and potatoes. Egg plant was a mush of eggplant and onions, salted beyond recognition. Lamb must have been cooked a week ago. And you could have drank the hummus. Been to Turkey and Greece plenty of times and I'm sure both countries would be disgusted this place claims to cook their food. Strongly advise no one ever eats here"}
{"text":"$5 lunch special. I was hoping my shawarma would be better. It tasted ok, but missing some of the usual depth of flavour. The tahini sauce was lacking, or some kind of sauce that would compliment the chicken and tomatoes. Usually the first bite doesn't have much for sauce and as you bite further in, that's when the action begins with the last bite a sensory delight when the yin yang of spicy hot sauce and garlic come together. This time, the sloppiness didn't happen and that's what shawarma is all about. Along with dryer than normal meat, I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went there on Monday and my friend has the chicken kabob dinner. I ordered a side of fries and me and friend shared her dish. That same night, we both got so sick with symptoms like painful stomach ache, throwing up and diarrhea. Today, I called the owner and told them politely to tell them to check their inventory to make sure it is fresh so that other people cannot get sick. I talked to both a girl and a guy and they were both so rude!! They practically yelled at me and told me not to tell them how to run their business. I'm never eating there again! To everyone who lives around that area, be careful and don't go there... unless you might want to miss out on work and spend 3 days in bed."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst Greek restaurants I've ever ordered from. The wrap was tasteless, the chicken souvlaki was dry and unedible, and the side salad came with yellow lettuce, one olive, one sliver of onion, one tomato slice, and a square of feta.   I will never order from here again. A waste of money."}
