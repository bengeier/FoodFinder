{"text":"One of the worst poke bowls I've had. Ordered #3, it felt more like a salad than a poke as it was full of lettuce & carrots. Very little rice, fish. The Sesame sauce was good but overall it was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Got the crispy chicken, crispy shrimp & tempura and salmon rolls with the kimchi, sesame and spicy sauces to go. Both my cousin and I loved it! Would totally recommend taking the shrimp tempura with either sesame sauce or kimchi sauce. I just wish that they gave more kimchi sauce, other than that everything is perfect. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I tried Moushi with my friend simply because it was near her place. The decor is quite adorable and the service is quick. Great for quick lunch! I love poke but I think that Moushi is a bit expensive for the quantity and quality given. I've been to different poke restaurants and they are much more generous and have more ingredients than Moushi. 

If you are in the neighbourhood, I think you should give it a try! Maybe next time I would try their sushi burrito!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant! It was my first time having a poke bowl and I was pleasantly surprised. The fish tastes pretty fresh and the bowls are a good size. The restaurant itself is also super cute! My only complaint is that the amount of fish in the bowl is not that much; I would have liked to have a bit more. Still delicious, though! I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Well executed sushi burrito, it wasn't falling apart or drippy. Got the shrimp tempura and crab stick, the flavour combination was great! Their sesame sauce was to die for.
I find sushi burrito/poke bowls places rather overpriced, but this was fine if you get a student discount (limited time promotion though) 
Loved the chill atmosphere and decor, felt like a crisp clean cafe. Staff was super friendly too! 
In comparison to other places I've tried, this was the best. However, I still have my doubts for hype food."}
{"text":"They dont have a lot of choice on the menu but the food was pretty good for the price. The best part was the sauce! Finaly, the service was really friendly.

I will recommend to all my friends"}
{"text":"I had the number 7 pok√© bowl and was quite impressed by the freshness of all the ingredients. The lettuce and cucumber were crisp, the mango juicy - just perfect. The fish (salmon and tuna) was the big star of the dish. The fish was not seasoned or drowned in sauce, and therefore its fine natural taste just shone. I was surprised by the very generous amount of fish in my bowl, too - no skimping here!"}
