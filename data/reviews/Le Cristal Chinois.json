{"text":"Dim sum here is by far the least interesting in town and there's no cart service - you have to order off of a small pile of menus... so no points for experience. The food ranges from bad (very greasy fried squid that comes off as freezer-grade fish and chips), to bland (most dumplings), to ok (crab claw with shrimp). Also, prices are about 20% higher than the excellent Kam Fung and the reliable Ruby Rouge (it's right next door, so... why are you here?). Lacklustre service seals the deal. Pass."}
{"text":"We came here early afternoon on a Monday. My girlfriend and her friend, both Korean, and myself - white boy. We're not experts on Chinese cuisine, but the food here was good.

Let me say that the three-dollar price rating seems a touch in accurate. We got 8 dishes plus a mooncake-plate dessert. The price came to $70 with a ~17% tip. They were serving us complimentary green tea the entire time.

The room was very large and definitely underpopulated at the time. I can imagine the restaurant gets crazy when it's full of loud, laughing, intoxicated Chinese people. Although I would have preferred that type of experience, we had a quiet and lovely afternoon lunch. Out of the eight meals we tried, the BBQ pork buns and siu mai dumplings were the best. Our shrimp/pork fried rice was delicious as well. However, the chicken feet was unusually large and unappetizing and the flavor of the duck was disappointing. Still, for the price and 6 other delicious orders, we loved our time here.

If you're looking for an exciting, clean and upscale appearance for dim sum in Montréal's Chinatown, definitely come here. It won't break the bank."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Shanghai, and as a rule, every time we go to another city, we try out the \"local Chinese\" food at least once.  This was our stops Montreal, and it was pretty damn legit dim sum.  It's always a good sign when you go for dim sum and its full of old Chinese people  large groups.  Nothing in particular jumps out as being amazing, but in general the whole experience was very reminiscent of a real Hong Kong breakfast dim-sum experience."}
{"text":"Normally you would be able to get a sneak peak of what the ladies are pushing in their carts when they abandon their Franglais explanation and just show you what's in the steamers. Le Cristal remedied their a la carte ordering system by providing you with a photo album of all the dishes that they offer... like those bars in Thailand where you can pick out your date for the night... I mean drink of choice. Price wise, Le Cristal is a bit more expensive, but not enough to notice when you're in the company of fellow dim summers and dumpling aficionados. Give it a shot, it's solid. I plan on going back to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"If I could rate negative stars I would
Do not fuxking eat here
Avoid at all costs 
They left the poop on the shrimp instead of cleaning it 
Everything was disgusting"}
{"text":"I love dim sum, so was persuaded by the positive reviews to give le Cristal a shot. Found the restaurant to be very clean and tastefully decorated but a bit lacking in personality. Was disappointed in the quality and taste of the food. Found everything lacking flavour. Of all the dumplings I ordered, none were better than I could have made myself from store bought frozen packages. The squid was nicely done, sticky rice bland and sauces doled out in small cups as though it was gold. The Staff was very friendly but I would not return. Food quality is unfortunately not worth the price they charge."}
{"text":"2 years ago i had my wedding banquet and the food was delicious and the portions were generous.  It's still a fairly new Restaurant (2012) so decor and ambiance are a notch above the other grand chinese restaurants (kam fung, ruby red)

Yesterday i made the mistake of choosing this restaurant instead of La Maison Kam Fung for my newborn daughter's 1 month celebration because i was mislead by their outdated menu and competitive prices on their website.  I dont know what happened to this establishment but this restaurant is now on my blacklist.  I was extremely disappointed for the following reasons:

1.  The service is just subpar.  Our waitress appeared to be wearing her jogging outfit as she wore yoga pants and bright running shoes and only spoke her mother tongue.  Also she clearly didnt have any experience.  Another waiter had more experience but he brings a lot of attitude.  Service was quick most probably because it wasnt busy on a sunday evening at 6:30 pm or perhaps everyone else knew to avoid this restaurant for evening dining.

2.  For what is supposed to be the best upscale chinese restaurant in Montreal, the food is decent at best.  The portions were very small to the point i had to ask the manager if they mistakenly ordered half portions instead (It was that ridiculously small).  The green bean sprouts they used in the vegetable dish were too ripe.  The twin lobsters were very small with little meat.  The fish wasnt fresh.  I was surprisingly disappointed because  the food was great at my wedding banquet in June 2013.

3.  I'm willing to dish out for quality dishes with reasonable portions.  What angered me the most was the exhorbitant prices they charged for what appeared like half portions.  The worst rip-off was the twin lobsters for $90 when we are currently in lobster season.  C'mon man!  Also their menu and prices on their website are not reliable information as they have been outdated for 3 years and i was mislead by it.

So in a nutshell, with subpar service, mediocre food, shameful portions and rip-off prices.  There's absolutely no value added at this restaurant besides its upscale decor and quiet ambiance.  

I really dont know what happened in the last 2 years but I will never pick this restaurant again nor will i ever recommend it.  This restaurant is to avoid."}
{"text":"We went for dim sum, sunday afternoon.

The place looks grand, the new chandelier makes it look very modern, except the birch wood paneling looks cheap, go figure. This place is huge, they had chinese banquet in mind when they opened this place, there are going to be many a weddings here, can't wait to go hahaha...

The dim sum here is different, you get a list and check off what you want and they bring it. Don't forget to ask for the picture book so you can order the dish you want without really knowing what it's called, as the french/english translation is somewhat misleading and sometimes just contradictory.

We found a veggie item on the menu which was translated into shrimp dumpling in english and listed as vegetarien in french... if you don't read mandarin it's a ring toss really, lol. But if you have the picture book it helps. 

I like the new way of ordering dim sum, you order what you want, and you're not tempted to over order because they don't have traveling carts and don't pander to you anymore... it's a more sedated dim sum experience, there is no longer that element of anticipation when a cart rolls by, but at least when you get your food it's just what you want to order. A lot of places do it this way now, it's more efficient and there is less food waste.

They have a few items that I would definitely try next time as I don't see it at other dim sum joints in mtl. The food is tasty, it is well cooked and cooked right. from dumpling to soup to noodles it is all good. We ate it all without soy sauce or hot sauce, the mark of good sim sum is you eat it without condiments, and on that point, this place really shine!!! ding ding ding.

The thing that ticked me off a bit was the service, it was not up to par for an upscale place. Service is inefficient (although I don't grade on service) add that to the pricey food (42$ for two taxes and tips included, avg price whould be 10-15$ pp), it makes me reconsider coming back here often. 

I would definitely come back because there are things that really make me curious, like what's their peking duck like? But the price and service means I'm gonna have to come when I have extra dough and not in a rush... which rarely happens :P"}
{"text":"Went there for a private event. The place seems nice decor-wise. I havent had that much chinese food in my life but I had a feeling it could have been better. I tasted stuff at lower end restaurants like  Fu Lam which were as good if not better food-wise. Waiters were ok, nothing impressed me though for the price we paid."}
{"text":"First of all, one of the dim sum experiences is to pick from the stream cart what entices your tastebuds. No stream cart here. You ordered from the menu (which you have to match the pictured menu to the pick ticket that takes some time to process). Then you have wait to wave down some person that only takes the order not just anybody. Then you wait... and wait...before they come back and tell you they are out of what you ordered 10 mins ago. The process start all over again. If we were to pick from the cart this will not have to happen. 

No about the food, we get the usual such as har gao, shiu mai dishes as we have always been when we venture into new city to try out their dim sum. It's consistent with their service. Less than luster. I had a piece of fried taro with pork that's rancid. So beware. Food is no better than just average at best.  We paid for what ate and left before we get all our orders in. We went to Kam Fung."}
{"text":"Terrible dim sum. A bit too pricy but more importantly terrible flavours and some very blande.  From Vancouver and every place in Vancouver I have had dim sum at is far better. Do not go."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!! The resto was not even halfly full. I waited 30 mins after order and nothing came.  I talked to the manager that I've been waiting for too long and I need to takeout the food since I would be late for work. His attitude was horrible!!!! He said \" we're not red ruby! we can't serve it fast, the food takes at lease 15 mins to come! go the waiter!!\" He actually yelled at me. So I went to the waiter and he again pushed it back to the manager \" I'm too busy now... go to the manager!\"  

Of course you are not red ruby, because the service and the speed you have will just nvr reach to the same level of red rudy. If you're charging so much for dim sum, you should at least provide some service  that would match your price level. The food is just average, and how come it takes forever to come.  I will nvr go back to this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because I really like their mango pudding, but the rest of their food is only decent at best
The reason I gave them only 1 star though is because they have really bad service - maybe the worst I've ever experienced ! 
I came here with a group of five friends, and whenever we asked the waiter for something (like sauce), he'd just stare at us - I mean, if you're not going to say \"okay\", at least nod your head in acknowledgement! 
Their service is quite slow too ... We ordered mango pudding after we finished the savoury items, and it took over half an hour for them to deliver it."}
{"text":"Marvellous! Best dim sum I've had in Montreal!

Though a bit too expensive comparing to other places, but the food is really delicious. The decor and ambience is amazing. Big windows on the 6th floor allow very little distractions.

What I love even more about the place is that the ceilings are quite high, and thus the environment seems less noisy.

The service is very average however."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for dim sum and once for dinner.

If you are driving, there is free parking underground during dinner service. Just bring your ticket up and they will validate it for you.

Okay, dim sum review:

They had a good variety of dishes and being famished, we ordered 12 plates. I highly recommend the XO sauce turnip cakes, tofu with prawns, beef rice rolls, lotus wrapped rice, and the bbq pork pastries. If you are into the chicken feet (I am) then get that too, because it's pretty good.

For 12 plates, we paid $61 including tax...which in my eyes, is a bargain for what you get. It's the only place in Montreal that I would go for and as a Vancouverite that has had some of the best dim sum, I've finally found a place here that I can call home.

Dinner time!

We ordered the peking duck, 2 lobsters with E-Fu noodles ($10 extra), free range chicken with ginger and green onions and a plate of pea shoots.

The first course of peking duck with the pancake wraps was great and very filling. However, the second course is traditionally, made with a lettuce wrap and instead they did a fried pastry. Not sure if I like it so much, since it seemed like this dish was more appropriate for a lunch meal. No big deal though.

The lobsters were on special (2 for $28) with a choice of 5 different ways of making it. We decided to get it stir fried with green onions and garlic and it was very tasty and fresh. They don't use the biggest lobsters, but there were 4 of us and we weren't complaining.

The free range chicken awesome! Highly recommend it and goes well with white rice since it's a bit salty by nature.

Pea shoots with sauteed garlic was a nice way to break up the meat dishes and decent. 

Dinner was $120 including tip and taxes. Not bad considering I ate like a king...or should I say, an emperor."}
{"text":"Excellent service, really good food and good prices (before 11am everything is $2.50). However I ordered vegetarian dumplings and they had shrimp in it. Not vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant ever! Bad food quality and horrible service!! Payment with credit card, waiter added tips without authorization!!!! Gave you the terminal with the total amount (20% tips include)  and asked you to enter the password!!!! What kind of service did you provided worth 20% tips? This is ridiculous !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For chinese dim sum, this is actually a good place to go to. The surrounding is very nice and pretty. Scenery is beautiful too. I like how the tables are very spacey in comparison to a lot of other dim sum restaurants. Prices are a little high but this is not Toronto, so I would say its quite fair. The food itself is good for me, but my parents and relatives thought it was below mediocre. Staff service is great - of course  it's probably more beneficial to bring someone who knows the language, so you know what you are ordering."}
{"text":"The food was good, and it was not as greasy as other places. I would definitely try it again if it weren't for the chefs smoking in the back, letting in the fumes into the dining area. That was a true letdown.

On the bright side, our waitress was very helpful and offered us extra oranges for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great food! For me, I think good quality rice is the main point for HK style BBQ. I was surprised their rice is very great. And the meat is crispy outside and juicy inside. Doesn't have very oily taste at all ! If I travel back to Montreal next time, I will go to this place !"}
{"text":"Went for DIM SUM the food was good nothing special but I was with a lots of newcomers to DIM SUM and I had to order for everyone much easier where they come around with carts but I guess they don't have since they're highly rated in Montreal"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant serving Pho and chinese dishes.  I come here mostly for the BBQ meats.  Try the duck, chicken and crispy pork on rice.  They include a soup with this dish.  All for around 10$.  The iced coffee is refreshing.  Good place to grab a quick lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"Been there several times, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It has never been disappointing. I'm Chinese by the way. The price for breakfast is unbeatable and they manage to keep the dim sum high quality. All staff are Cantonese, no wonder. Tea is always offered for free and you have several choices. I recommend green tea over the others. 

Price for dinner is a bit pricey but totally worth the price. Don't forget to order their steamed fish. That's Cantonese' s specialty. 
And the soup, too! I also ordered crab last time, was pretty fresh. Freshness is most important for me when order seafood. Veggies are nicely cooked also. After the meal, free desert is also offered. 

Anyway, I understand the frustration westerner might have with Chinese menu, but I really like this restaurant. 

Service is been pretty fast for me also but when there are a lot of clients they do tend to slow down so wave your hand when they can see."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we come back, but this will be the last time.  Service is horrible.  Still sitting here waiting for food.  Still missing half our order. Keep asking but being brushed off.  There is no rush as all the tables around us, whom have arrived around the same time, have all their food and almost finished.  The table which arrived after us, who are clearly friends or staff are also almost finished their meal as well.  3different waiters and a manager, no apologies as of yet.  They clear don't care and they clearly don't care if we ever come back so we won't."}
{"text":"In the year since I have been to Le Cristal Chinois - previously my favorite dim sum place of all time - the food has gone way downhill. No longer can I justify paying over 20$ per person including tip, because when I came here this morning the food alternately tasted as though it had been sitting out, or it was just plain cooked improperly.

We got shrimp dumplings, shiu mai, meat dumplings, rice wrapped in banana leaves, sesame ball filled with salted egg yolk, beef spare ribs and one other dish. The most appalling of the listed plates was the sticky rice in leaves -- typically one of my favorites, this one was tiny and the rice was far too overcooked and gluey.

Overall, I was crestfallen. I always tell people that this is my favorite place for dim sum, but I will never say that again after today."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3-4 times for dim sum, and there's always something disagreable that happens. Sometimes its the service that's ultra slow, sometimes its the food that's reproachable. A visit to la Maison Kam Fung - which is in my opinion better - settled the matter for me: I don't like Le Cristal Chinois.

The venue is certainly beautiful, with the high ceilling, large windows and draped tables. It gives a great first impression, especially for events (you can rent the place for weddings, etc.). Since the dining room is enormous, you also have more chances to find a table during busy dim sum hours, when most restaurants would be packed full. 

Unfortunately, the food/service fail to impress, and so I try to avoid Le Cristal if I can help it."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with service. Everyone was helpful when I needed to find out where to pay and when I needed more napkins and such. This is surprising for a Chinese restaurant, usually service isn't too great. (Sorry to say). Dim sum I would say was good, maybe because the service was so good that the food actually tasted good. 

I had the typical dim sum dishes like the shrimp rolls, the siu mai etc. The chicken feet was very delicious actually. Atmosphere was almost like I was at someone' wedding, but not. The chairs were soft. Not that it matters, but they really were soft. 

Would recommend going to check out this dim sum place. It's new, it's refreshing."}
{"text":"Appalling service, okay food.
Ambience: Service is in a banquet room which seats around 300, so it's pretty noisy and as far from intimate as you're likely to get.
Service: Possibly the worst I've ever come across - no exaggeration. After 1.5 hrs I only ended up ever getting half my order and had to leave. Waiters varied between no caring, being straight-out rude or completely clueless as to why I'd expect anything else given how busy it was. I witnessed at least 3 other tables complaining about their service and more than one or two diners getting up to get themselves clean cutlery.
Food: The one order I did get was okay, but nothing special. Pity, really as the other item I had requested was the more interesting sounding one.
Price: Good. Though no offer to reduce or comp my meal was ever even given in spite of everyone knowing I had to leave hungry and unsatisfied.
In short, I never judge places on service alone, but in this case I'll make an exception - I'm never ever going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, it's a nice alternative to the rushed pace of other establishments.  Here you fill out forms with the quantities of the items you'd like. If you don't know what the items are, have no fear! They have laminated picture menus upon request. This method requires more work from you but the trade - off is fresh items straight from the kitchen. We were a party of 3 adults and 1 child, and ended up ordering 11 dishes, which meant plenty of left overs. Pre - tip I think it came to around $70 (including a soda). Everything I tried was very good, the congee is probably my favorite version thus far. 
As an aside, it's a clean restaurant which my bf insists is really important."}
{"text":"Terrible service.....but the food is ok....a little expensive than the other Chinese restaurant...."}
{"text":"This place was completely empty around 8pm and the staff were like vacuuming and stuff. Bear in mind they close at like 10pm; still plenty of time and they even asked us to please be seated. They think I'm crazy?? No one is there eating at your place, something ain't right. Might come here when there's people."}
{"text":"Big nice dim sum place in China town 6th floor.  Orders are mainly in Chinese so bring a friend heheh good luck. Try not to over order and they don't like it when you cancel a dish. So, try to know what you want.  Weekends, they mainly have the cart but not week day."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, the chef has left the building. Clearly, something is amiss here since my last visit. The carpeting looks worn and in need of a serious power wash, the servers look dis-spirited, and the food...utterly disappointing. We tried over a dozen items and each had its own flaws, from under seasoning (beef balls, beancurd rolls, sticky rice), to being overcooked (chicken feet, breadsticks) and also of suspect ingredients (shu mai, har gow and anything sweet related). This restaurant appears to be on the decline, which is sad because when it was at the top of its game, it raised the playing field for every dim sum joint in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Located on the sixth floor of a mixed-used building, this restaurant is my favorite dim sum place in Montreal. On a return visit, the restaurant was already half-full for a late morning meal. The dining area is huge, well-lit due to the windows surrounding the room, and nicely-decorated. Unlike some places where ladies wheel carts from table to table describing each offering, this restaurant allows guests to select dishes from a trilingual menu where you indicate the number of plates desired. It is similar or what you will find at any sushi place. Despite the multiple languages, we found it difficult to locate all our favorites... Four of us went through the menu of steamed and fried offerings, congee (rice porridge), and sticky rice and still needed the help of our attentive waiter. I definitely should have checked out their website beforehand where their online menu includes pictures of every item served.

I sampled the following:

SEAFOOD:
Scallop and chive dumpling

MEAT:
Spare ribs in pepper sauce - it was recommended and definitely lived up to the billing
Meat balls on tofu skin
Beef in rice noodle roll - good except that the sauce was average this time around
Barbecue pork in flaky pastry - both the pastry and pork were outstanding
Siu Mai with caviar - much larger than what you will find at other places

SWEET:
Bun with creamy salted egg filling - never seen this on a dim sum menu; would probably not re-order
Deep-fried sesame ball with creamy salted egg yolk - same filling as above

In all, it was well worth the visit despite the recent snowfall and chilly weather."}
{"text":"Living in downtown Montreal, we were only 5 minutes from the small cozy chinatown, so we decided to get dim sum. Not knowing which restaurant is good, I asked these Chinese ladies on the street and came here upon their recommendations. The moment we walked in, we can feel that it's a good place! The ambiance, vibe, and crowd were all signs of goodness! Here's very different from NYC. Instead of ordering as the carts come by, we choose a bunch of items in the beginning and the items are then carried out in carts over to our table. Because we were starving, we over-ordered with 8 dimsum items (for 2 people). We couldn't finish any one dish! I would recommend 2-3 full dishes per person. 

Now the dim sum! I would say the dim sum was above average but I was a little disappointed with my favorite fried taro dumpling because it was kind of oily. It may be that the oil was not hot enough when it was being deep fried. Other than that most of the dim sum were fresh, hot and yummy! The servers were all very attentive and friendly too!"}
{"text":"We wandered into this place after a long drive from the States because the sign outside reminded me of those in Hong Kong. The food, size of the dining room, and decor was also like some of the better restaurants there. The pan friend noodles with seafood was the best I've had in years. You can definitely find less expensive options in Montreal's Chinatown, but this is the place I'd definitely make sure I visited again."}
{"text":"I've had dim sum in New York, China and Hong Kong and this is right up there with them. We went early on a Sunday morning and it as very quiet so can't speak for busier times but service was better than expected (and friendlier) and food was fantastic!

Not sure what other dim sum restaurants cost in Montreal but the two of us were stuffed to the brim for a mere $31. WELL worth it. We will be coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Montreal last week and we randomly decided to try this place to satisfy our cravings for dim sum. 

We definitely start off the meal on the wrong foot, because we requested Jasmine tea but was given old tasting Oolong instead.  We did receive the right tea after we brought it to the attention of the wait staff.

We ordered fried squid, har gow, the beef noodle crepe, and beef chow fun.  Fried squid was okay but it wasn't battered so it was not what we were expecting.  The har gow was okay as well.  Noodle crepe was thicker than most other dim sum places I've been to and the meat bland.  The beef chow fun had to be the worse we've had in a long time.  They don't use fresh noodles and so it's drier than other places but by no means does this mean that it was light.  Since the noodles weren't fresh it seemed to have soaked in a lot of grease.

We only had dim sum and perhaps they shine with their dinner menu, but we would not recommend this place to others.  The service was spotty after getting our food and then they lost our teapot when we asked for a refill of hot water."}
{"text":"Food is good and big serving for the price for their soup menu.
However, the waitress (who the only person who served the entire place) are very rude! She reasoned out to the customers. She was about to put my husband's order in front of me and her hands was a bit shaky, my husband said that it was his order and to be careful coz my 10th month old is beside me. She walked towards my husband, put the soup with resistance, shook her head and mumbled when she turned around. At that instant, we were already uncomfortable, but then we didnt have a choice but to stay and eat. We called her several times to ask for bowl and fork, but her face were the ugliest expression I had even seen in a waitress. 
I really like the food there, but to be served by a rude waitress, it is not worth coming back! Also, we ordered pork and duck bbq. They have a warm pork hanging and on the pan, but for some reason, they took our order somewhere and heat it up in the microwave instead of cutting from the fresh ones. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"#500th review !!

I felt like Chinese BBQ and upon entering, I found limited seating (about 10 tables or so). Many Asians came to pick up orders or hang around and eat their lunches on-site during my stay. This was a good sign for things to come.

The BBQ is family owned and deserves to be tried at least once! The food however may not be for everyone as some cuts aren't very common. They do have other options but you'll generally only find things you'll only find in authentic Chinese markets.

We ordered a meat platter with a friend which consisted of various cuts of duck and pork. While we waited, we were given some delicious warm tea. The food was prepared quickly and well presented in a platter. The place is very clean.

The service was VERY helpful and accommodating. Our waiter (owner?) came up to us and explained everything. As two guys (one half Italian/Spanish and the other half Haitian/Jamaican) who were eating their first true Chinese BBQ... it was well appreciated.

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and really enjoyed the pork. The duck however... I realized isn't for me. Maybe it's the texture or flavor... or simply perhaps I can't help myself from feeling I'm chewing on Donald Duck's carcass.... I didn't end up liking it.

Price-tag is very good.

Will come again."}
{"text":"Amazing! We went there for Chinese New Year - the service was amazing and the food quality was superb! It was comparable to that of Hong Kong and Vancouver (being a Honger myself - it was really nice to see!)

A big plus, was that the washrooms were immaculate and plentiful. (I know a very strange thing, but I NEVER go to any of the washrooms in some restaurants in Montreal due to their lack of cleanliness)."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de choix, calmar et dumpling très bon. Semble avoir beaucoup de msg. C'était correct mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food. Yummy but pricey"}
{"text":"If you are looking for dim sum that is like other places, but has a bit fancier environment and higher prices, this is it.

Le Cristal Chinois is located on the 6th floor of an office building. Seats near the large glass windows offer nice views. The whole place is open and airy.

This restaurant offers great variety, especially if you are looking to eat chicken feet, pork intestines, tripe, tendons, and pig ears.

The fine line is this... If you don't like these things, perhaps you should think twice. If you do, you may also find the flavour somewhat lacking on some items. (The pig ears are probably the best bet among items you won't find in a fast food chain Chinese place.)

However, if you just want a classic dim sum experience without much concern for the finer details of food or service, this should suffice."}
{"text":"Food is excellent... authentic Chinese dishes which are guaranteed to please even the most discerning Asian palate. There is a wide selection of items from the menu. Try the Peking Duck - spectacular. The assortment of dimsum is tasty, albeit on the expensive side. 

The restaurant is new, so it's clean and provides a pleasant environment - quite different from some other Chinese restaurants one may find. 

Service however is only so-so. Servers are too busy to pay particular attention to diners. Try asking for more chilli, or replenishment of tea, or for the soiled utensils to be cleared.... you'll expect to wait, and wait, and wait..."}
{"text":"My friend and I quite coincidently parked in Chinatown and then spontaneously decided to get dimsum. Because we didn't know a good place, my friend asked random Chinese ladies to recommend a place. Thus we came here. 

The food was really good except all the fried dishes has too little filling. And it was very oily. Everything else was very good. My favorite was the rice noodles filled with tofu! The service wasn't that fast but it wasn't slow either. I'd definitely come back here again if I'm ever in Montréal."}
{"text":"Trop cher et beaucoup de \"hype\" á mon avis."}
{"text":"Though I haven't been in Montreal for long, I can safely say that this is the best dim sum I've had in Montreal. 

The restaurant is clean and spacious. I like the fact they have the traditional dim sum option and some unique ones you won't find at other places. Honestly, the very slight difference in price from Kam Fung is worth it. 

Service was ok. There were times we'd ask for more tea or water, but it didn't come. I have to admit that I miss the carts, but overall still happy we tried it here. Can't wait to take the family to check it out for themselves."}
{"text":"I went there twice.  The first time when they just opened and the second time was at my grandmother birthday two nights ago.  

The food was very good and the view on the window is exceptionnal. We had a fast service and the staffs were very nice."}
{"text":"Noticed this little BBQ and snack house as I was picking up some take-away from Tong Por next door. Entering in they have a little restaurant with some dim sum items plus BBQ Chinese meats. I picked up a piece of some BBQ pork (char siu). A smaller piece was $10. Not bad! Also they had whole BBQ duck and other items. 

BBQ pork was very nice and tender and melted in my mouth. I asked for a less fatty piece and mine provided was on the upper limits of my comfort levels.

I asked how long they've been open and the owner mentioned a few months. 

I'll come back to test out the Dim sum another visit!"}
{"text":"Good place for traditional HK style roast meat ... only thing I find this place weird is they dun do plain noodle soup so that I can eat it along with the roast meat ... 

Price is fair ... and I would recommend this place ... the soy sauce chicken is one of the best I had"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst, if not the worst restaurant I've ever been in. We went for dinner on a Friday night and I would say the restaurant was probably only 30% full (so not very busy). All night, the service was just terrible. Their reasoning for the lack of service was that there was a party/karaoke thing going on next door?!

1. The waiter forgot to write down one of our dishes. We placed a second order for that missing dish and it took 50 minutes to come.
2. We went specifically for the Peking duck but it was only decent at best. I would not recommend getting the Peking duck, which at $46 was way overpriced for the quality. The $26 pork was also the tinniest plate of pork I've ever seen in my life.
3. All of our dishes came cold. Not even warm! The second Peking duck course with the lettuce wrap came 2 hours after we placed the original order. Unacceptable! All their food was okay, nothing spectacular. 
4. Before the last \"missing\" dish came, a waiter gave us the bill and started taking plates away. He thought we were done and completely wasn't aware that we still had food to come.
3. They do not do split bills and conveniently their machine was broken. (We were not informed of this \"cash-only\" bullcrap when we first arrived.) There is an ATM machine in the building but completely inconvenient for large groups of people.
4. We asked specifically for a certain amount of toonies back for change (and the waiter made a comment along the lines of how inconvenient it is for him to get this much change.) AND then they go ahead and bring us back loonies - claiming a miscommunication between the waiters themselves?!
5. Apparently at another table they told the customers that they didn't tip enough. (Seriously?)

You can't pay me to go back to this restaurant. It's an utter disgrace."}
{"text":"Great bang for the buck.
Service is good. If you flirt with the waitress, she'll bring you free soup.
Great crispy porc."}
{"text":"We waited for 40 min to get first dish -the soup.The soup is not that complicated. We were so hungry and finished the soup. only have to wait other half hour to get the rib, and it was not we ordered. What can I say! I was too hungry. I kept the dish. Wrong decision! We also ordered one steamed fresh fish(60 dollar worth) Another 10 min later, no fish.... Was told to waited 15 min more. Are you kidding me, 1.5 hour since we ordered, you hadn't steamed our fish. Never will I go that place again. 

The soup we ordered is huajiao soup (dried fish belly) which is good. I liked it. The rib was not  what we ordered but it was too much fat. I don't like it.  The xo sauce rice noodle was a little bitter. I don't like it either. 

This restaurant has ruined my Valentine's Day. I noticed at least two other table complain about their dish or canceled their order. If you are having trouble in your kitchen just let me know before we order. We may order something easy to cook. But this way I will never come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Passing through Montreal and checked Yelp for recommendation of a dim sum place. I have been to Maison Kam Fung, so I thought I will give this one a try.  Although it was rather late, I think around 2:30 pm.  

We walked in, the male hostess had no smile on his face and not even a good afternoon...... I asked for a table for two.  He showed us to a corner table where there is a petition between the stage like space.  Someone were actually working on organizing the petition.  There were board sliding next to us all the time, there was the PDS station next to one of our chair.  We sat down.  Five minutes later, there was still no service.  No one come to check with us if what kind of tea do we want... etc.  I waved to the hostess, I saw only one dim sum trolley in a distance.  So I asked him if there is still dim sum.  He looked at me and said the reason why there are some dim sum order sheet on the table is that we order our dis sum  then someone will bring it over! I thought WTF! How do I supposed to know how it work if this is the first time I am in this restaurant.  Then I ask him is someone coming to serve us tea.  He said yes and then walked away.  A few minutes later, som one just brought us a pot of tea without checking what kind of tea do we want.  

I waved again to another waiter to put my order in.  The fish porridge was finished.  The male hostess did not even bother to ask if I want something else, and just cross out the item on the card and walked away.  

We waited for ages and no one take any notice of us to want to have the bill, so we went to the cashier and pay.  When we did not leave a tip, the cashier asked why? We said we did not like the service, and that was that, no incentive of trying to find out why!! 

Some Chinese restaurant closed between lunch and dinner, but the hostess could have told us that we are too late.  

The space is actually nice, the food is so and so, and with service like this.  There is no way in hell that I would set foot in this place ever again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  Ask them for some missing plates and they spilled water all over my phone.  And then the waiter refused to give extra paper so we can clean up his spilled water.  Come only if you want a screaming match."}
{"text":"I am surprised this place doesn't have more stars. I have been here many times and I was never disappointed with the food. The restaurant is huge so you never have to wait."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude, like customers were beggars. No refill, no service. They scratch out items on the order without even telling us, when we asked for the bill, nobody comes for good 15 minutes, so we went to the front desk to pay, the guy there gave us attitude for giving him the trouble, ridiculous, truly a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I'm a little torned with this place.  I want to rate more than 2 stars because we've ordered their BBQ as take outs  many times and we've never been disappointed...their duck is nicely roasted and well seasoned .  As for their roasted pork skin is delicious. It's crispy and the meat is juicy. 

I would stick to ordering only their specialties.  Don't expect anything for their their vietnamese dishes. In fact I would avoid at all cost and stick to ordering only their BBQ dishes.

Today we tried  their sit down restaurant and we were extremely disappointed. 

I ordered their Vietnamese spring rolls with chicken and shrimp to start with.  When the waitress brought the appetizer to the table,  I couldn't help but notice something black piercing through the rice sheet of the spring rolls. 

I make these springs rolls myself at home  I knew there was something off. I ripped the rolls to check inside. I realized they were rotten mint leaves.  They just disintegrated in my fingers and I couldn't believe  the cook would even consider putting those inside the rolls.

I flagged the waitress and she immediately took them back and you can hear her talk to the cook telling him that it was in acceptable.  10 minutes later she came back to apologize  and stated they don't have mint anymore and will cancel the order ... if they didn't have any fresh mint why not just skip the ingredient or replace it with Thai basil? 

Next, the waitress brings the Pho Bac. The broth was aromatic, very \"star anisey \" and a little on the salty side.  The slices of the rib eye beef were over cooked and this is a big no no in a Vietnamese pho.  The cook must have had the meat sitting in the soup way too long.  Rib eye beef slices are supposed to be served mid rare as they it bring to you. The rice noodles were also  overcooked. As you pick up the noodles with your chopsticks, they would break off.  I ate %25 of my dish because I was put off my the broken noodles and the appetizers.

Order only the BBQ dishes and skip the rest."}
{"text":"Today's experience left a pretty horrible image in my mind. The service was bad, as in the waiters weren't cleaning the tables and when you were done with your meal they didn't bother to come and take the plate away plus the manager or boss whatever had a really bad attitude. For dishes that expensive i wouldn't go back ever again. As harsh as it sounds, going to Mcdonald is better than going there."}
{"text":"Had their pho with 3 color iced drink. It was not good.  The drink was too sweet. The items inside were not soaked long enough cause the beans were too hard. The pho soup was too salty, the meats had a sour after taste (nearly expired on discount meats from next door cnt maybe?). My mom had the veggie soup, lots of veggies but undercooked and over salted soup again. Maybe their other dishes are better. Whatever you do, don't get the viet soups. I should've known that a jack of all trades won't be an expert in any but we were starving."}
{"text":"Service is bad, food is very mediocre, bland or wayyy to salty. There are many other options im chinatown that are a lot better and cleaner then cristal. 

The vue is nice though..."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE FOR DIM SUM! I ordered the worst steamed rice in bowl (???) EVER in my life! The food is really mehhhh, overpriced and not tasty. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch around 2pm. Unfortunately the waiter took a while to take my order as he forgot that I was there. The yumcha was not bad. Coming from Sydney Australia, it's hard not to compare it to the yumcha places in Sydney, like Phoenix. Definitely not as good, but not bad for a place in Montreal. 
Paid for the meal with a 28degrees credit card but the machine was not accepting it so I had to go to an ATM to withdrawal and pay in cash."}
{"text":"Went here upon suggestion from a food blog website.  Ordered 7 items and after 45 minutes only three came out.  Those that did come out were cold and not tasty. 

Servers have a horrible system of managing tables and it is easy to see why food gets cold.  Even if things came quickly and hot, it isn't a place I'd recommend. 

Thank you to the manager for halving the cost of the three items we ate but this is not a restaurant I would recommend."}
{"text":"Actually this place was not bad. I was expecting the worst. Portion was so big as you can see by the photo. Vietnamese noodles were also good esp. the soup.  But I was here for the BBQ pork which was also excellent."}
{"text":"As my rating this place was OK!!! Service was better than expected as the have horrible reviews on the service. But when we went it was quite. The Dim sum was just OK. Chicken feet and Congee was very poor. But loved the Shu Mai. We also ordered the ginger lobster which was great!! Fried noodles were good but the meat tasted synthetic!!! Not sure what they do to it or how they prepare it but it has such a weird texture!!! Would I go back?? Probably for a meal but not for Dim Sum!!!"}
{"text":"What's that!? A dimsum restaurant in Montreal that's worth talking about? Get out of here! But we finally have an alternative for dimsum other than Kam Fung or Ruby Rouge; an alternative with a slight modern twist (read fancier and more expensive.

As we entered the restaurant, I was in awe! The setting is surprisingly beautiful: modern look, chair covers, fancy plates and huge windows (the fireworks will be partially visible in the summertime I believe). I am sure this restaurant will be a very popular spot for upcoming weddings.

Unlike the other places, there are no old Chinese women who barely speak English pushing carts between tables. Instead, younger waitresses take down your order and bring them to you as they come right off the kitchen.

The food was in general very good. Some of the dishes had a modern twist to it. For example, they had a rice noodle roll stuffed with Kobe beef. Another dumpling had a touch of truffle oil.

However, the service was seriously lacking. I'd even say it was horrendous! Spilled water (on my friend), spilled sauce (on my other friend's jacket), a batch of dumpling still raw, etc. The waitress just showed my friend the way to the bathroom to clean his jacket. The worst is that they took so long to bring some of our food that we gave up and asked for the bill even though there was still 1/4 of our order still to go. I think all of us left still a bit hungry but we didn't care at this point. We complained to management only to receive some meager apologies. 

For any other restaurant, I'd suggest NOT to go based on the horrible service. However, I really want this restaurant to succeed. Yes it's a bit more expensive but I don't really mind: you pay for the fancier setting! The food is good enough that I'll go back for sure. I believe that le Cristal Chinois is a good addition to the Chinatown scene: a breath of fresh air! 

PS: Please note that we went there on New Year's Day. Not only was it a very busy day but they had been opened for only 2 weeks. So the service may have improved by then."}
