{"text":"Brand new place at York University. Food was ok. Nothing special. Reuben sandwich was tasty but no better than any other deli. I have had better. Lots of beers on tap and tv's. Very noisy. Extremely uncomfortable tables/chairs. Not good for students with backpacks/jackets, etc. Something they should have thought of but now will be too difficult to fix. Oh well YorkU, I had hopes for you."}
{"text":"Shopsy's is now down to 1 star and if I could give them none i would. My most recent visit was the first day of school and everywhere was busy.  There was ONE server for the entire patio.  ONE.  I felt bad for the waitress as she was run off her feet and did the best she could.  Group of 4 arrived at 1:10 and didn't have anyone take our order until after 1:30.  We only had until 2 pm.  We ordered drinks and nachos.  The waitress could order the food from and iPad on her arm so the  kitchen got the order immediately.  The drinks however..... Apparently the bartender was MIA and so she couldn't get those for us.  We finally got our beer at 1:50.  Had to guzzle a pint very quickly because we had to go.  We paid the bill before getting everything just so we could leave on time . Shopsys - you should be embarrassed.  This is rediculous poor planning and tie waitstaff deserve better."}
{"text":"Somewhere between a 3-3.5 but i'd like to point out this is shopsy's, so prepare thyself for chain restaurant quality. it'll do if you're at York, on a budget and on the hunt for noms. 

Why rosie like: 
-I'm on a budget and its 10:30 and the only thing reasonably healthy is a $10 burrito. Do you hear that? Doesnt that sound awful? Yeah, that's the sound of my bank account crying.  

FIVE BUCKS FOR 3 EGGS, BACON AND SOME FILLING CARBS (or bread/toast, as the board outside lists) - with maple butter, gawddamn, this maple butter deserves a point of its own- AND SOME FRUIT? OH, WHY HELLO THERE, TABLE FOR ONE PLEASE. 

-maple butter and the sweet potato fries dip/sauce/dense liquid/whatever it is (a chipotle concoction of some sort??) their dips and sauces are on point. 

-location: listen y'all, your options for a beer to celebrate the midterm you just wrote (and very likely just failed) are limited. Plus, space and decent-er food than other bar-like establishments in the area. 

What could use work: 
-food could be better (read: not cold sandwiches, crispy vs semi-soggy fries) 

-Service is efficient. Stuff came, orders were taken, patience was there-ish, and uh, yeah. 

Nada to write home about but it has its perks I guess *shrug*"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I went there with my friend and got the mac and cheese balls and the chicken nachos. The balls were very greasy but edible. The nachos had very grisly chicken which I couldn't even swallow, next to no cheese, stale chips, and a mushy bland pile of tomatoes. 

I went with another friend and ordered fries and a reuben sandwich. The sandwich was, again, mediocre. Lacked flavours, wasn't enough dressing or sauerkraut and the meat was poor quality. The fries were bland as well. They tasted like cardboard. 

The last time I went, and I mean the last, was when I ordered their famous chili dog. The hotdog itself was good, but the chili tasted canned and very salty, and the bun itself fell apart the moment I touched it. I wound up eating the weiner by itself. 

To top things off, the service is really, really poor. On all three occasions, I was largely ignored and only got 1 refill on my water. They have so many waiters that is seemed like a given that I'd be checked up on periodically. I was, once. It was when one waiter dropped off the reuben, and literally a minute later asked how things were. I hadn't even finished the pickle on the plate. 

The pickle was good. Everything else wasn't."}
{"text":"I walked in here today and my request to be seated on the patio, preferably under an umbrella was clearly too difficult for the hostess to accommodate so she said 'I'll let you find your table' and then handed me the menus to carry over. What now? Why yes, I'll find my own seat AND carry the menu to my table as well. Should I take my own order while I'm at it? That's just terrible customer service right there and it's really turned me off the place."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer and to catch the leafs game with some buddies. This place has a good selection of snadwiches, burgers and other bar foods. However, the food here is not the cheapest. Domestic pints are about $6-7 and service can be extremely slow depending on your luck."}
{"text":"Came here once when Shopsys was fairly new and had the steak sandwich with pretzel buns which was DELICIOUS. I came back recently ordered the same sandwich, 30 minutes later our food still had not arrived... Finally 40 minutes later our food came and it only came with one piece of bread..... Not sure if it was even the pretzel baguette they had said it would be. The bread was SO soggy that I couldn't even eat it. My friend and I had requested medium rare but we both had well done steaks. Giving two stars only because the steak was well seasoned, and the waitress was decent, but definitely not going back ... There are so many better choices at York lanes"}
{"text":"Note: This place just opened less than a week before my visit, so I'm sure some of the issues I experienced are growing pains, so I'll revise this review should I have a better experience in the future. 

I was excited to see Shopsy's open a location at York Lanes. Finally, something to kinda-sorta fill the void left by Blueberry Hill's closure! I came with a group of four on their sixth day of business. It took fifteen minutes to get a table. Upon being seated, our server brought four waters and two menus to our table. I had to ask another server for the drink menu. Our original server came back in a few minutes to take our orders. 

A few minutes later, we had two new arrivals to our group and asked if we could get a bigger table, or bring over the empty table beside ours. Our server said she'd try to get us a booth when another group leaves in a few minutes. We then asked another server if we could just move the adjacent table and she said no, the table is taken. We asked our server the same question when she returned a few minutes later and she moved the table over and wiped it down for us. Then the other server came back and basically told us off for moving the table after she said we couldn't. When we said that our own server moved it for us, she said \"Oh, okay then\"...Alright, so was the table actually taken or not?? What was the point of denying us a few minutes prior? Pretty annoying. 

We asked our server for a pitcher of Rolling Rock, but she came back and said that they were sold out. We then got a pitcher of Steamwhistle. Everyone agreed that it tasted a bit off or watered down. Not great, but at least the price wasn't extortionate ($15-$16). I definitely appreciated our server splitting the pitcher three ways onto separate bills - that was helpful. 

The new additions to our table didn't have their food orders taken until after the pitcher came out. The server pretty much bolted as soon as she took the drink order. We kept telling other employees walking around that we still had to order food, but they'd just tell us to wait for our own server. Seriously?? Meanwhile, these same employees kept coming to our table to ask if the plates of food they were carrying around belonged to us. Uhhhh...shouldn't you know which order belongs to which table? Never experienced that before. 

When we finally got our server to take the remaining food orders, she told us that they were now out of onion rings (in the early afternoon!) and commented that they were running low on a lot of items. We already had some onion rings from the first order and they weren't good anyway, so no loss there. 

Overall, a really abysmal experience, but hopefully they get their act together in the next few weeks. The food is not cheap and the novelty of having a new licensed restaurant will wear off soon enough. 

One thing about their seating - the tables are quite high and the stools have no back. This means the only place to put your jackets and bags is the floor under your table. They really need to install hooks under the tables because it isn't fun to have your belongings sitting in water, salt and dirt from people's footwear.  I was surprised by this oversight. 

They have a bunch of TVs around the restaurant. They were showing hockey, UFC and infomercials, but none of the TVs were in HD. Hopefully they get HD hooked up so Shopsy's can become a cool place to gather for televised sporting events. 

Overall, this place has potential. I'll probably be back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of coworkers for lunch, and it wasn't that busy. The waiter that was responsible for our table was nice and attentive to everyone's needs. The menu consisted of your typical sports bar food and the atmosphere was the same. This location gets busier towards the evening but the venue does have a very high capacity so I doubt that there's ever any wait.

I decided to get the chicken wings with their house dry spice rub ($13). They had a handful of other flavours for the wings like smoky bbq, buffalo, kick ass, honey garlic and lemon pepper. No one had to wait too long for their food while the others had theirs served already, as the food arrived fairly timely. My dish itself however, wasn't that great. I found the chicken wings to be overcooked to the point where the moisture within was almost non-existent. It was more enjoyable to eat the vegetables on the side and the dry rub wasn't that great either. The money spent did not reflect the quality of the food. Although I feel that for most people who plan to come here, after having had enough alcohol to drink the taste of food wouldn't be a priority. My coworkers mentioned the sandwiches were okay but no one seemed to have had their taste buds blown away.

I might come here again to try the sandwiches, in hopes that it might be better but as of now I can only give a single star in appreciation of the good service."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Place was empty. Waited 30 min for a sandwich. Paid for food and left it on the table. Never going back."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER.  We were seated at the back corner on plastic chairs (felt like BBQ clearance chairs) and the  waitress carelessly gives out menu and left.  Didn't bother to offer WATER or ask what we want to drink.  Never came back.  We waited over 15 minutes.  I asked another waitress who SAID she will ask the server to come by as we where ready to order waited another 10 minutes... 

We left.  We complained to the host and she said sorry.  

Avoid AVOID AVOID

We went to Pad Thai Express instead.  Good food, fast, quick.  

Shopsy's you are blacklisted and we complained to the head office as well."}
{"text":"Gross and disgusting, with the worst service you could ask for.

My friends and I came in after a long class and we got seated on these uncomfortable stools with the tiniest table ever, near the bar. Literally no room to put any bags, especially if you're with someone.
We ordered drinks that were not properly mixed, maybe the bartender had an off day but some drinks had way too much sugar and way too little alcohol- we didn't pay $7 for a sugary diluted disgusting liquid..
The food I ordered (chili cheese hot dog) was delicious, although messy. I liked it, and that is why this place gets a bit higher than 1 star.
When we asked for the bill, it took the waitress over 20 minutes to bring it over. After I paid, I waited for my change and couldn't wait anymore (I had to go to my next class), so I asked someone for our server. This worker simply told us \"Your server is lost at the moment\" and left. Uh!?! Even if that happens, you don't tell your customers that... well, we did a quick scan and found our waitress in the corner, just standing there and looking lost. 
Since I couldn't wait anymore, I had to leave my friend and get her to track the waitress down for my change. 

Bad service. Work on it, guys."}
{"text":"If you're a student on campus or just visiting, I'd recommend going to Shopsy's. It's a nice restaurant, decent decor, music and the servers are very attentive. I preferred when Blueberry Hill was still around but times have to change. Whenever I go to visit at York, I always make it a thing to stop by Shopsy's. The food is really good, then again - I'm a burger guy and I've only tried the burgers - so it's safe to say the burgers are good here.

I love the patio, especially with the warm weather. The hostess did not actually offer the patio, it had to be requested, but at least tell me the patio is open.

Overall, food was good and service was decent.

3/5 - Would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Drinks are ok; then again its a bar and it can be hard to screw up drinks.  I've been brought the wrong shots before on multiple occasions whenever I go with my cousin to catch a game.

The food can be rather mediocre but its one of the only bars on campus.

Don't get the calamari.

{"text":"2.5

Shopsy's is a half decent spot for a meal at York University - if you're ever in the area. The venue has a typical sports grill type of feel to it - dark and very loud. It's not really my scene but was with a group of people and did not object to their choice. 

Came in without a reservation and was seated right away. The servers and very friendly and made sure to accommodate my group. The seating is a bit odd - the table seating is a bit higher than the actual chair - but that's ok... 

The website is also not up to date and I was informed the menu has completely changed...its more streamlined now and there's less options. 

The food itself is not half bad...decided on fish tacos which came with fries. Portion size is on the smaller side, although the taste is flavourful. 

The price point was a bit more than what I expected for a university. In all, Shopsy's is a decent spot for dinner if you are in the area and are craving the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place once I saw that they had a full bar! I usually come to school straight after work and it would be nice to grab a bite to eat with a drink every once in a while. Well that was a pipe dream. 

Customer service: I came here within the first month of it opening. It was busy but I was seated immediately. The seating isn't that comfortable and there isn't much room to out your bag or jacket. I was dining alone so I put it on the chair opposite of me. It is noisy but I don't mind that if the food is good and the drinks are flowing. My waitress was friendly and had some knowledge of the menu but she was sick and it was disgusting. You can't have sick severs sniffling and coughing. If it is visible that your staff is sick you need to send them home it just appears so unhygienic. 

Food: I blame myself for ordering the lobster Mac and cheese. This place seems more like a burger/ht dog joint but I've been dying to try lobster Mac for so long. Well let me start by saying the lobster is basically non existent and has a fishy taste. U don't know if they used can lobster or imitation crab but it was not good. The Mac and cheese was not good either. It wasn't creamy with cheese strings. Way too much bread crumbs. And who serves Mac and cheese with bread? Just so much carbs and everything was so dry. It was blah! So blah I didn't even eat half of it. I ordered some type of fruity cocktail with pineapple juice. In pretty sure I was just drinking juice because the alcohol could not be detected. So my overall experience was pretty disappointing. 

However, I will go back and try poutine and either or burger or wings. I feel like they will probably do better and I will update my review then."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple friends. Got the three cheese baked cappelletti and it didn't taste as good as it sounds. It didn't come in a ramekin baked dish but a plate and the cheese sprinkled on top wasnt melted. The sauce was a bit too salty and the cappelletti was hard. My friend got the butter chicken curry and it was unusually spicy (she had it a couple times before) and couldn't finish her meal. Definitely stick to the burger and fries. The poutine was good here but very small."}
{"text":"The staff helpful and efficient and the drinks good but the food sucked even for a burger that I ordered. It tasted bland and the consistency of the patty was not right, it was chewy and so boring. I could not finish it. go there for the drinks and skip the food unless you're very hungry."}
