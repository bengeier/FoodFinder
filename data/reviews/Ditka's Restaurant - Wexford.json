{"text":"A friend and I had dinner at Ditka's  Wednesday night and neither of us were impressed. Our waitress was very sweet but the food was way overpriced and mediocre at best. We ordered the calamari appetizer, it was plentiful but rubbery. I had the coffee rubbed steak. It was just okay, very fatty and gristly. My friend had the filet, it was also small and dry. Salads and sides were extra and bread was not served with the meal. I found out later that if you want bread, you have to \"request \" it. C'mon Ditka's , bread is cheap, unlike your steaks. If you are trying to be like an upscale steak house, you have some work to do."}
{"text":"Was greeted by great hospitality. The Tex Mex apps were great and the sea bass entree was extremely fresh. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Went on a Weekend. This was our first time. Ample parking. Host was gracious, server decent. Ambience was nice. Sit down tables separate from bar area. Unfortunately the main reason for going there- the food could not be more ordinary. It was nicely presented but lacked any flavor. Side dishes, appetizers or main course. For the price of it, very disappointing. Sorry to say this but if they change the food (chef), they may actually do quite well. If you want to see what great food and service at this price looks like , go down a couple of miles to \"Off the Hook\" and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Went to dinner Sunday evening 4/30/2017 and was totally disappointed. My wife and I ordered the Coffee Rub Delmonico. She ordered hers rare, and I ordered medium. Stakes came out and looked OK, but when I cut my medium steak it was oozing red bloody juice, also ordered the baked potato and it was very grainy and under cooked! I finally got another waiter  to signal our waitress that was chatting with another employee. I asked to have the steak done to medium, and complained about the potato, and asked if I could get the twice baked potato ($7.95) She took the steak back and in a couple of minutes another fellow returned with the steak, only to find it rather charred on the outside, but still very bloody rare inside. I took a bite and found the steak to be tasteless! I asked for them to just forget the steak, and my wife was eating her's and said that it also had no taste! If your going to charge Ruth Chris prices, you better have the food to match the price!  We ate at the Robinson Ditka's in Robinson, and it was MUCH Better. I don't like to go to a restaurant immediately after opening, but they were open for some time now and it was the WORST!! Go down the road to Long Horn, or Texas Roadhouse and get a better steak with all the sides included for less than half Ditka's price!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food at the new Ditkas in Wexford. The food was way overpriced for what you get. I asked if the crab cakes were lump and was told yes. They were not lump crab cakes at all. They were very stringy, small and very salty. Seabass was just ok. The mac and cheese was the only good thing I had. Sides are not included with the meals. Chocolate cake was dry and tasted stale and had to send it back. The only good thing was the service. Our waitress was really good. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went last night for V-Day and it was fantastic despite a very busy evening.  Inside, really not much different than the Atria's it replaced... except for the pics of Big Mike.  Had a couple of drinks at the bar and the bartender was quick, witty, and engaging although very busy.  Nice job!  We didn't get the V-Day special (2 meals for $100), but went for the separate meals.  Quick service, drinks were promptly brought to the table, as well as a bread basket which they even replaced for our take-home!    Our server, Peggy, was prompt and on top of her game.  I started with a Caesar Salad which was really enough for 2 and was excellent.  Fresh and not too much dressing as they sometimes get. Timing was perfect between courses and the meals were very well done.  She got the twin lobster tails with asparagus and rice pilaf and I got the prime rib with a baked potato.  The tails were perfect and the rice pilaf was a bit different, but very fresh and not overly salty.  My prime rib was a bit on the rare side, which I usually order medium rare, and a bit unevenly cooked.  But the flavor and crust were phenomenal so that evened out to me.  Every bite melted in your mouth.  Never even used the au jus or horseradish sauce (which was a bit too bland for me, then again I used to grow my own!).    We don't do dessert, but by the looks, and empty plates from those around us, they were excellent.  Chef came out to check on our table which is always nice and management staff was active and busy.... even helping to clear tables with smiles on their faces.  Not sure where the negative comments come from, but I've eaten in many fancier places and this stood right up to most of them.    Maybe they've upped their game and cleaned up the kinks.  I'll definitely be back especially since it's right down the street!!"}
{"text":"My husband, mother, two young children, and myself ate here for lunch on Saturday. When we arrived, the restaurant was empty and nobody there to seat us. After waiting awhile I went in the back to see if we had accidentally gone in during a time when the restaurant was closed. The waiter I came across seemed annoyed that we were there, but he did seat us.  I ordered the sashimi tuna salad. My mother ordered a Reuben, and my husband ordered the filet with crab. For being the only people in the restaurant it took nearly 30 min to get our food. Mine was inedible. The salad costs 16.95 and had 4 slices of cold seared tuna. The tuna tasted off to me and was slimy. The asparagus and peppers were from a jar. I took a few bites and stopped. Our server was obviously disinterested and instead of asking me how the salad was safe pretended not to notice until I said something to her.  My mothers sandwich was mediocre. The bread was charred on the outside and there was only two slices of turkey on it. Her French fries were burned. She immediately asked the server for unburned fries and our server acted like she was unaware of the burned fries until my mother pointed it out.  My husbands steak was cooked well and he said the crab on top tasted good. It was the best looking plate of the three. Overall we wouldn't recommend. The price is not worth the quality of food."}
{"text":"First time customer for a birthday celebration.  Attentive staff for us with a few hiccups.  Ordered a Manhattan.  Nice drink with large single ice cube.  But a Luxardo cherry instead of a Marachino cherry is a $2 upcharge.  For my extra charge a half cherry was served. Really?   Salad wedge was fresh and crisp but a tired offering.  Pittsburgh diners will eat something besides head lettuce drenched in blue cheese crumbles, blue cheese dressing and bacon.  The filet and crab cakes were tasty but not quite what I imagined.  Crab cakes were more like dollops not cakes.  Steak filet was delicious and cooked properly to medrare. Unfortunately my dinner was served to the guest next to me.  Always an issue with waiters and runners.    Ordered a coffee with birthday cake but someone forgot to turn on the warming burner and 10 minutes later a fresh cup arrived.    Wife ordered a scallops and risotto.  3 scallops were large and well cooked but the risotto was not.  If you know risotto then you know it does not remind you of Uncle Ben's and cheesey cream sauce.  Avoid at all costs and substitute something else until a proper recipe is used."}
{"text":"First time here ... great service, delicious food, HUGE portions. Perfect for sharing or taking 1/2 home for dinner the next day; it's too much for one person. Definitely order the calamari - it is so tender and no tentacles."}
{"text":"Looking forward to having our first dinner at Ditka's restaurant.  Many flaws in the details of an upscale restaurant that one would not expect.    I used the normal pepper on the table since no cracked pepper was offered for a wedge salad.  After my meal was completed, noticed the table next to us was receiving the cracked pepper on their salads.  Received no dressing on the salad and asked for extra tomatoes which were not received until our waitress noticed once she stopped by to check on our salad course.  I like my steak well done and waitress stated at the time of order it may be burnt but what kind of a restaurant serves a charcoaled steak to a patron?  I ordered anyway and she was right on, the outside of the filet was entirely burnt to a crisp.  The inside of the filet was tasty but could not removed all the black burnt outer coating so each and every bite had a burnt to a crisp taste.  Hubby's seafood appetizer and main entree were perfect except for not receiving any melted butter or the utensils for removing the crab from the claws.  In a fine restaurant he had to use his fingers to remove the crabmeat until the waitress stopped by.  Ordered a dessert and asked for no whipped cream and the sauce on the side.  It came with the cream and the sauce was on the dessert.  Again, the waitress noticed this mistake when checking on last course and she was able to remove this from the bill.  The table waitress did a fine job but the abilities to get the much needed details were lacking in full force from the kitchen and help staff.  When a patron spends a small fortune on upscale food and drink at this type of restaurant, one expects much better quality of the service."}
{"text":"We visited for an early dinner on a Saturday afternoon/evening.  Because it was early there was only one other table when we walked in but much busier by the time we left.  Service was great!  Our server came to our table promptly and made sure we understood the menu.  We started with the calamari appetizer that very good but I was disappointed it was all rings, no tentacles as these are my favorite part.  The server pointed out \"all rings\" so I guess this is a selling point for most.  For salads I got the Mike's salad, my husband had the chopped salad.  His was quite a bit smaller than mine even though they were in the same size bowl.  I didn't finish mine as I was afraid I'd be too full for dinner.  For entrees, I had the filet which I ordered medium rare but was more on the medium side when it arrived.  It tasted great so I didn't send it back but would have preferred it a little more rare.  Hubby got the meatloaf that he really enjoyed.  I tasted it and thought the BBQ sauce was a little sweet so I'd get it on the side if I ordered it.  Sides of asparagus and mac & cheese were both tasty.  It was our first visit and the general manager came by our table to deliver a small amuse bouche that the offer to first timers.  A nice touch but it was a bit odd when we saw the table behind us receive the same thing but from a runner rather than the manager.  All in all a good meal albeit a little pricey but I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We so wanted to have a new steak house restaurant. We loved the crab appetizers and the shrimp cocktail. We order steak, including my 8-year old daughter, we like our meat well done. Preface, we had had well-done steak at Ruth Crisp, Capital Grill, Morton's, Long Horn, Jordan, etc. the steak was like crusty ashes. I tried to eat it, but could not. My daughter cried, \"I do not want to hurt your feeling, but I have to spit this out.\" They gave me a free glass of wine, but my kids were hungry...off to McDonalds. My \"picky\" daughter hates everything, but pizza, she hated the pizza. Wait a while before visiting this restaurant. Go downtown, where the food is good.  $130.000 later......it sucks!"}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour. A Ditka's employee I met out one day told me to stop by because they had a great happy hour with great prices. I don't consider $5 draft beer a great happy hour. However, the service was fast and friendly. No complaints about the staff. If you want to bring in a drinking crowd, you must compete with the many great happy hours in the area. I hope to try again in the future. Good luck."}
{"text":"Last night I attended a networking/ marketing event at ditkas in Wexford.   While I do love the remodeling since this location changed from atrias in November / there was literally no one there.  The event was from 4:30 -7.  If you RSVP'd to the event  you would be provided with one free drink and free appetizers.  At 5:10 this appetizers still weren't out.  The manager was very friendly and while I do think this is a unique way to bring the community together - if you advertise that it starts at 4:30 - you should probably actually be ready by that time!  I have not yet dined at restaurant - but will be back to try out the location for dinner at some point.  The prices on the Menu are a bite intimidating so I hope the food is superb!"}
{"text":"We decided on short notice to try the new Ditka's. We went with friends on a Saturday shortly after it opened. It was disappointing. The building was updated from the Atria's that was there before, but only superficially. It was still the high ceiling, open room, not the dark wood, intimate setting you expect and pay for at an upscale steak place. The food was okay, but not consistent with the high prices. We had crab cake appetizers and seafood pasta as entres. We ordered a 'shareable' spicy hash browns side which was decent but far too small to be shareable.There was no bread offered or served. The server was never around, hurried, ran by throwing our drinks when passing by; overall pretty rough around the edges. The wine list was very limited and poorly designed. The only thing consistent with an upscale steak house was the prices. Some of the problems are fixable, some not. Too bad - we could use a good steak house out here."}
{"text":"Very expensive for run of the mill steak. Happy hour is unhappy with bland sliders, 3 oysters for 10 dollars, and soggy nachos. The staff is excellent but having mediocre food makes it difficult   It is not clear if they are st striving to be a high end streak house or a sports bar.  They are not successful for either  This has potential but they need to decide upon their market"}
{"text":"Love this place! Our server..Juliann was so sweet and very helpful since this was the first time we were there !  Love the appetizers.. and the Neptune salad!   Thank you Ditks's for a enjoyable lunch !   Thumbs up to you!"}
{"text":"If Ditka had his smart he'd  take his name of this location. Don't  serve crappy steaks and call yourself a chop house. Don't."}
{"text":"On the spectrum that is Outback Steakhouse up to Ruth's Chris, this steakhouse falls only slightly closer to the Ruth's Chris end (yes I know there are better and worse places than those \"ends\" but they're mainstream enough for broad understanding).  My wife started with the Mike's salad which she found crisp and flavorful, and I went with the Organic Kale Caesar, which was good but not unique. We moved on to the 8oz halfback filet (ordered medium though it appeared medium rare) and the 16oz coffee rubbed Delmonico (medium rare), which our knives cut through relatively easily and we enjoyed. The waitress warned me that the Delmonico would be a fatty cut and she was right. Our sides were sweet potatoes, which were less firm than expected, and mushrooms. We finished with the dulce de leche ice cream and raspberry sorbet, which were tasty but unremarkable.   One drink, 2 salads, 2 steaks, and 2 small desserts with 20% tip came to $165. We'll keep this place in mind for the future, but certainly have other restaurants in the area to try before returning."}
{"text":"We arrived early for our 6pm reservation to check out the bar. The bar area was pretty quiet. I ordered a glass of Ditka's pinot noir and my husband had the Manhattan special cocktail from the menu. The bartender was very friendly and we both enjoyed our drinks. I did, however, find $15 to be a little pricey for a \"house\" type wine.   Our additional guests arrived and we were promptly seated. Throughout our meal, our water glasses were filled and the service was top notch. Ronnie, our server, was very accommodating and went through the menu and recommendations since it was our first time at Ditka's.   We started with the wedge salad, which my husband and I split. Ronnie was very accommodating and brought an extra plate and extra dressing. We had heard great reviews on the prime rib, so it was a must try for both my husband and myself. Was it the best prime rib I've ever had, no. But it was above average. The au jus, button mushrooms, and creamy horseradish definitely took the prime rib up a couple of notches. We both ordered the 12 ounce size and thought it was filling. We also split the twice baked potato. The portion size was good, but I found it to be a bit over cooked.   Others in our party had the crab cakes and chicken madeira. Everyone cleared their plates and commented that they enjoyed their meals.   Several other reviewers commented about the lack of bread. Our table initially received two baskets of warm rolls (3 in each for our 5 person party). And then we were asked if we wanted additional rolls.   Ditka's probably won't be my \"go to\" steak restaurant (we're pretty partial to the Capital Grille), but I'd probably go back again for a change of pace."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was an insanely busy Valentine's Day night and they pulled if off wonderfully. Everything was timed well and our server and the staff were great. The chef even cane out to make sure we were ok. ( not a big eater so I always take home food). Going back for sure and soon!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The bruschetta was absolutely amazing; probably the best I've ever eaten. Steaks are a la cart which can make for a pricey meal, but that's typical for any better steak house."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I want to give the extra half. I would give 3.5 stars if I could. We were seated immediately by a nice hostess. Oh, the smell...it smelled so good in there. Steaks on the grill good. Warm and inviting good. The first impression was, wow, no one wants to wait on us. A few minutes go by, enough that we have time to make our choices. No water no greeting. Then we hear the waitresses talking with the hostess about who will take our table. Someone? Anyone? Finally our waitress comes and greets us and let's just say things got off to a rocky start. Still took a while for our water glasses to be filled and then she asked a waiter if he was taking us. I don't think we smell...we were dressed nice...hmmm, not sure of the issue. Once she brought our water and took our orders things progressed smoothly through the rest of dinner and she was better. I guess our smell went away? ;) we got drinks. I ordered a coach's Cosmo, fruity and light. I enjoyed it and they didn't skimp on the alcohol which is a good thing. I also feel the martini was a little bigger than most but comparable on price with other places. The hubby got a beer, a ditka's. It was really tasty. Hubby got the crab bisque. He said it was all right. Not the best, not the worst. I got the pork chop which comes with apples and sweet potato mash covered is a cherry jus. My chop was a little overdone but still was juicy and had good flavor. The hubby got the Delmonico steak which was quite good. It was tender and juicy. His a little under done. Then for the stars, dessert. I chose the turtle ice cream cake. Wow! A nice crackery crust on the bottom of a mound of ice cream covered in a chocolatey shell with pecans on top of that and sitting on a plate of caramel. Delightful! The hubby chose chocolate chocolate cake which was moist and chocolatey. Overall it was good. I think there is definitely room for improvement but I feel like it's a nice addition in the area."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ditkas is a sister restaurant to Atria's--the crab bisque and pot roast nachos are the same, as well as a few other menu items. The difference: prices are jacked up to reflect a steakhouse. Service was terrible and the chef and manager were both present but didn't bother going to any tables but one (obviously they were friends) to see how the meals were from other patrons. Crab bisque was watered down and had no flavor and my meal was very sub par. The lack of customer service and poor quality of the food will deter my husband and I from coming again. Go to a real steakhouse or another well reviewed restaurant instead."}
