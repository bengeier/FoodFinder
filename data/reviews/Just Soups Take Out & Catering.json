{"text":"Didn't know this little establishment was even here. Just smell the goodness! Need I say more? #JustSoup #Scarborough"}
{"text":"My hubby and I always come here when we are to lazy to make soup at home! Lol! Love This place,  they are always consistent with the taste aswell as the soup tasting very good."}
{"text":"This spot was really good. I tried the red pea soup and it was off the chain. It had a lot of food in it which I love when it comes to soup.  I will definitely be going back there and I would recommend anyone to try their stuff"}
{"text":"Just Soup. Guess what they sell here... Delicious soup. Awesome soup.  Different special every day. I have been to the restaurant 3 times now and when you're looking for a real, tasty, homemade soup; this is the place to go. One guy reviewed and asked who puts potato in soup. JAMAICANS do! And they do it right. It's not full of potato, it's the right amount. Flavoured nicely and they keep a jar of pepper on the counter so you can add as much as you like. This place is the real-deal for soup and if you like Jamaican soup like momma used to make then get your @$$ in there and get your soup!"}
{"text":"the best corn soup in the GTA. !!!They make soup with the perfect amount of dumplings and spices. Anytime, I eat here, it always reminds of my mom's TnT soup recipe."}
{"text":"Solid soup place...has an ever-so-slightly sketchy vibe to it...you order your soup and the woman disappears into the back...usually closes the sliding window so you can't see back there and then eventually emerges with your soup. Also seems to sell a selection of Jamaican movies in DVD from a glass case...sort of random.

Generous with the veggies, less so with dumplings, but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price. I wish they would offer some bread or crackers for the soup...would be a nice, easy add-on. But this place is what it is and doesn't bother with the bells and whistles. Really deserves a 3.5 stars. The red bean is my fav by far."}
{"text":"The owner has forgotten respect for he's customers... it's disrespectful that he is cutting corners and putting very little of the main  item in the soup... so it's basically a broth with carrots and some potatoes. 

I use to go to this spot when it opened. And now I wouldn't give my money to a mom and pop shop that doesn't respect the quality of the dollar."}
{"text":"Was in the same plaza picking up some food and dropped in for their soup of the day which was beef soup. 

A small take-out only place is minimally decorated (which is not a bad thing) and a very friendly mother and son duo greeted me.  They had a couple of hot sauces (made in store) on the counter but I didn't get a chance to try them this time.  

The beef soup was hearty with lots of veggies (carrot, potato and corn...etc) and dumplings, it was so flavourful and filling.  

I'll definitely go back to try their other soups.  Maybe the \"mannish water\" soup next time??"}
{"text":"I love soup and when I found out about this place which just serves soup, I had to give it a try. The place is more of a take-out joint. There is a few bar stools if you really must to dine-in. They have different soup specials for each day and for today (Wednesday) it was beef soup. 

There is not much in terms of choice. Just whatever is written on the chalk board. There is no paper menu or pictures to go by either. Since it was my first time here I just asked the owner which soup was good and he naturally said all of them. I just decided to go with the soup of the day which was the beef soup. Medium went for $4.75 which was a fairly good size. 

I was not too sure what to expect but when I dug into the soup there were lots of stuff inside. Chunks of beef, potatoes, carrots, large pieces of dumpling dough and probably a whole bunch of other ingriedients. The soup had a nice balance in terms of thickness and was not too watery. I really liked the overall flavour of the soup and was glad that it was not overly salty.

It might sound like just a simple soup but I was pretty impressed overall and would not hesitate coming here again."}
{"text":"3.5 Meh (this comments coming from a Jamaican soup expert lol ) ... Based on the chicken soup size large.  Looked good. Price is reasonable. They only hve a choice of chicken , vegetable, and fish. Flavour resembles vegetable soup with some spice which is weird because it wasn't even red. Not really the real Jamaican taste but it's along the lines. Had only two pieces of little dime sized chicken and two dumplings :(. I'm sure if you're not familiar with authentic Jamaican soup it'll be great. Glad I gave them a try to put my wonders to an end. . Will I be back? Maybe to try the red peas or beef soup if it's available"}
