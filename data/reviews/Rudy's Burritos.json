{"text":"The food is not good. Enchilada sauce taste very bland and strange. Kids meal are bad and it's all over priced. It's an open kitchen too. I don't see how they pass health inspections . Won't go back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Rudy's at least once a week for over 5 years. My wife's favorite Mexican food item is a chile relleno and she has had them at dozens of restaurants.  She says no one makes them better then Rudy.  I'm partial to the carne asada burro, taquitos and egg &  chorizo burro which you can get all day.  Here you get to watch Rudy and his clan make your food right in front of you.  You don't have to wonder what is going on in the back, is the cook smoking or are the roaches crawling all over the kitchen like you have to do in the typical Phoenix area taco shop."}
{"text":"Came here based on local and yelp reviews.  Our party consisted of my husband, 10 yr old daughter & myself.  I found the food \"Meh...\", pretty bland - until you put some of the sauce on it.  My 10 yr old wasn't a fan of her bean & cheese burrito & ended up just peeling the tortilla off of it and eating that.  I'm not saying that the food was horrible or even bad, it just wasn't the best I've had.  The staff was friendly and looked like they enjoyed working with each other."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Red salsa tasted like refrigerator. I asked for 3 veggie tacos with just potatoes, pico, and lettuce, and they put like 10 French fries in each taco. SMH... if someone asks you if you have potatoes and all you haves is fries, you say no. Green salsa was decent. Almost 9 dollars for these frie tacos and they don't even have ketchup."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Owner Rudy is even better. Take the time to find this place and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. Fast and friendly service :-). Rudy is a awesome owner and operator. Go see if in the area, small sitting area, mostly fast food environment. Rudy does have sit down restaurant on Guadalupe and Hawes."}
{"text":"(written by my son)  Hello. I am 7 years old and this is my first review. First of all, the staff were very nice and helpful. The food was REALLY good! I ordered the super nachos and they were pretty good. About a 10 out of 10. SO IT'S PRETTY YUMMY!!! If I could rate this 100 stars I would, but I can only rate 5 stars at max. So yeah, that's my review."}
{"text":"The food was good, but looked like they needed a maintenance person, there was food all over the trash can, the tables weren't cleaned either."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! This authentic Mexican was fantastic. I like to judge a place based on their chiles rellenos. Theirs, hands down, was the best I've had in Arizona! Guacamole was fresh and delicious with no fillers. Beans, chips and carne asada were great as well. We are so glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Love Rudy's!  We've never had a bad meal there!  Our favorites are the street tacos, burrito bowl, burritos, breakfast burritos, and of course their homemade chips and salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried the bombero burrito for breakfast. It is dam satisfying!!!! The red salsa is delicious as well as there green salsa(I got both). I also tried there fish tacos which is very nice. The have fish tacos for a dollar on mondays. I am very well pleased with the food I got. Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Rudy's has great customer services. It's a little, almost authentic, shop. They are a mexican family that obviously serves to the liking of those who frequent. The salsa is lacking texture, flavor, and peppers. The tortilla was tasty, the meat and beans however, lacked flavor. The meat in the tacos was great quality, but again, not authentic street tacos. It is reasonably priced. I eat a lot and being mexican, I've eaten mexican all over the U.S. and Mexico, but by LA standards, rudy's is ok."}
{"text":"Great tasting Mexican foof. I love this place. My favorite is the California burrito. .."}
{"text":"One word best describes this place.  DELICIOUS!!!  My husband recently picked up some food to go from this place and I absolutely loved it.  Authentic Mexican food at its best!!!  Been back a couple of times since and everything has been excellent!!!  Will definitely be frequenting this place whenever I'm craving Mexican food."}
{"text":"Burritos are great. Carne Asada tacos are so yummy. The customer service is pretty good except for the language barrier. However they get the job done and serve great tasting food so I am game any time I get the chance to stop in for a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed I can assure you."}
{"text":"Owner or manager is excellent.  Good food, neat authentic old town atmosphere and fun to shop at the furniture place next to it.  The only thing I would recommend is a more attractive happy hour and normal size beer mugs."}
{"text":"Love love love love LOVE this place. Small family owned business with DELICIOUS food. The people are always very friendly and will always strike a conversation. Definitely my favorite place to go if I want take out."}
{"text":"Rudy's Burritos,  is a great place to eat for breakfast,  lunch and dinner. There service is fast and freindly. I  love the California burritos very filling and delicious as is everything on the menu. Sometime I have a hard time deciding  what to eat because it all tastes so good."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what we were looking for! The chicken tacos and enchiladas were excellent and even the kids cleaned their plates. I like that you can order sides of beans and rice, because that's all my kid really wanted. Everything tasted good and was fresh. In my personal opinion, the beans could've been a little less runny and I like my salsa a bit chunkier, but all of the flavors were good. The kids loved the churros. Good service and good food!"}
{"text":"I love the people here, but the food is bland.  Still better than Taco Hell however."}
{"text":"Everything at this place is made from scratch. The tostados are great. The churros are awesome. I got the sopas and they were probably the best I've had. There isn't anything on the menu that's bad. If you want some great Mexican food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food place hands down, California burrito is fantastic and there food is always super fresh."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley. I go there every week and that's because I force myself not to go more. It's a local mom and pop restaurant with really good prices. Buritos cost $4.50, I HIGHLY recommend the shrimp and carne assada, these are my favorite! But the shrimp is very special, it's an orgasmic experience! Also they make their horchata and meat is cooked to order. They are very friendly, and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Have given this place a few chances hoping to like it since its so close to my home, and my neighbors were mixed in their opinions, however, all have said there food is very bland! I completely agree! This is Az which borders Mexico! Is it to much to expect some flavor in their meats?   There portions are pretty small and pricey! I asked for lettuce once on the street tacos, instead of the cabbage and was charged .79 extra! Really?   Sadly, I would go to Taco bell (in same parking lot) which I despise, before eating here again."}
{"text":"Very Good Quality Fresh Mexican Food. This place has awesome Shrimp Burritos that they grill up right in front of you. Family friendly atmosphere and definitely a place you'll want to visit again!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food place hands down. My family and I love this place, the food is always fresh and tastes amazing. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with Rudy's. This is real freaking delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love the burritos and street tacos here. It's a small place. They have some good Mexican food. The kids love the churros here. Usually get take out from this place. Would recommend, better than Filiberto's."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and my go to is the Chile relleno.  That's the tell all if the place is good.  I went to the place on baseline and Ellsworth and talked with Clark - he's family to the owner.  The Relleno is definitely worth the trip, has to be in my top three. - delicious!"}
{"text":"Rudy's Rocks! Best Mexican Cuisine,,, street tacos are delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, short wait time. I would recommend their burritos over their enchiladas. I'd like to see some stronger vegetarian options, but other than that they have the basics down pat. Overall, they're worth a try if you're in the area- especially if you have a house full of hungry people to feed in a hurry. Also, their selection of young lady/old hag illusion-type wall art is way above average, even for a taqueria"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! We've been going to Rudy's for a couple of years now. It's the best Mexican food in the East valley. We absolutely love the chicken taquitos and the variety of burritos. It's family owned and operated and they treat us like family whenever we come in."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ate here all the time when I lived in Mesa. Now I live in SD, also some good tacos but don't compare to Rudy's. I used to get a haircut then 4 asada tacos...a toda madre!"}
{"text":"Been going here for 5+ years and they've never let me down. Super Burrito is the way to go!"}
{"text":"This is a very economical place to eat and the food is delicious. I usually get the carne asada burrito or the chile relleno burrito with carne asada. They are great to order ahead and for a quick meal. A second location is also good and the fish tacos on Monday are also great."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Love the street tacos and the green chile, my hubby likes the shredded beef chimichanga. Rudy is a great guy and the family/ employees remember us every time we go,  which I admit is often. Not a fan of their salsa but love everything else enough to keep going back."}
{"text":"I just happened to go there on a Monday and they have .99 Fish Tacos on Mondays.  The tacos were very good and all 3 of the women working there were all very nice.  I'm sure I will go back."}
{"text":"I came here because I was in the area and it was highly rated.  I had jus had Mexican food night before, lol, so here I go again.  I ordered cheese enchiladas which came with rice and beans.  The person who took my order was very friendly.  The place is very narrow and next to Albertson,s.  They do make use of the space here... It lost a star because the tables were not tidy and I had to search for napkins!"}
{"text":"WOW!!  JUST MOVED HERE I WENT IN TODAY TO TRY A BURRITO... WOOOHOOOO GREAT FOOD!  SERVICE WAS FAST, HUGE BURRITO AND WOW...I LOVED IT!!  Ground beef, cheese, rice, lettuce just perfect!!  Cant wait to go back.   2 small things...would love if they had cheddar cheese and a salsa for their great chips.  They have a good red sauce...i love salsa.  Hi five love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large horchatas, after handing us our large cups and we put ice in our cups we were told they did not have horchata.   Apparently because I ordered 2 fish tacos and my friend ordered one, that meant we wanted them served on the same plate. We are now closer than we have ever been before."}
{"text":"LOVE Their Burritos.  Have been going here for years.  Mostly run by Rudy's daughters now since Rudy has been sick but they all reckognize me... not sure if that's a good thing or not!  Anyways, the street tacos are good, but you go for the burritos.  They are amazing.  I take friends there all the time and friends who have lived in Mexico always agree it tastes authentic.  And SO good!    There are a few minor annoyances with the actual business, but  not with the food: The drinks are just not good.  The tap water tastes bad, so ordinarily I would get a soda, but something is wrong and they always taste bad.  So I always order take out and have my own drink at home or what have you.   They close at 8... not uncommon for a mom and pop shop but just a little annoying when you want to get a group together on a weekend.   The parking lot - sometimes - especially in winter - a bunch of snowbirds take it over for their car shows and I HATE it.  They are so rude if you are going there to, you know, park.  They act like they own the place.  I doubt Rudy has any control over this but I really wish I had a way of knowing if they were there or not.  I would not eat there on those days if I knew the old car show crowd was going to be there.  Wish there was a way to know!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Had the street tacos delicious. Husband had the lunch burrito al Pastor.  It was huge and he said very good and only $4.95!  The place is small, 5 or 6 tables. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Carne asada was good. Chimichanga was disappointing. Horchata was fine. Fish taco ok. Beans & rice was blah, red sauce was good green was runny.fake guacamole on the chimichanga, chips & Salsa was chips & hot sauce. Came with friends from California who know great Mexican. & they call foul."}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada fries and the meat was pretty good and so was everything else. The only problem I had was how overpriced it was for the small portion size. Finished the plate and left hungry and had to buy something else after."}
{"text":"We tried the shrimp red white and green burrito, simply the best!  So fresh and tasty! We will be back to try more dishes. Friendly staff.   Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today. The place is dirty and greasy, especially the ceiling fans. I was glad they weren't on. Food: very skimpy for a Mexican restaurant. Ordered the #3 and got about 2 ounces of beans. The rice tasted like dish soap. The 2 tacos were chicken and beef, tasteless to say the least. I won't be back."}
{"text":"To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement and a half. While I love a good greasy burrito (Filibertos), Rudy and his clan have managed to capture all that is right in a burrito, without making me feel like a debased heathen after consumption. Their Super Burrito is the only thing you should order. Anything less would be uncivilized. For the price, you won't find a better burrito. Thank you Rudy!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time.. called in today and was left on hold for 20 minutes. Went in there on my way to pick up my order from another burrito place for 20 people!!!!! Just to see the look on their faces as they looked at my phone and heard their voices on speaker phone. The girl even said are you sure you call us? As her voice projected through my speaker phone . Wow not even a sorry ..your employees are worthless..... i can get mexican food at many places and try to support my local spots... but after today and the way the women just stood there without even a sorry you should be shut down. I am going to do my part to make sure you lose customers by posting this review everwhere I can..... This is exactly why small businesses go out of business. ... I hope the owner sees this and actually cares enough to repond."}
{"text":"The tortillas were excellent. The carne asada is a little lacking in flavor, but this place puts together a solid product at a cheap price. A* , will come back again"}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to burrito place. Don't care that Chipotle is up the street. They make burritos how I like them. They put the stuff I like that others charge extra for. I'm a big boy and I love places where I can get really good food and be stuffed for under 10 bones. Having really nice folks behind the counter doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Not the most glamorous way to dine but where they fail in image they make up for in quality of food. Really really good food I will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I was told about Rudy's by a friend some months ago, and although it was really far away for me, I wanted to give it a try because of his enthusiastic vocal review and $4.50 burritos, and I finally got around to trying the place. Rudy's has traditional Mexican food like menudo, \"street tacos\" (4 for $5.00 and 99 cents each on Tuesdays), and a LARGE variety of combo plates. I definitely think you'll find something you'll like!  Rudy's is tucked into a nook to the right of Albertson's, Ellsworth and Baseline in Mesa. Dine in or take out, the place is spartan but accommodating enough for many people and has a mounted TV. There's also an umbrella'd table outside. It's a family business, and the daughters help out. I recommend eating in.  I had the steak burrito, and the ingredients are pure, predictable and delicious. It lacked some zing that I like, so I added some Tapatio, but if you're looking for the pure ingredients and their flavors, they're all there. I think next time I'll have the marinated pork, as I really like red chile. The dishes are simple, pleasing to the eyes and delicious. The burritos aren't as big as Chipotle, but they don't have to be, and the price is just right and that's the main appealing factor. I would say that the burrito NEARLY hit the spot as far as filling my belly, but maybe that's just me. I wanted just a little bit more, but I didn't want the bloat I get from a Chipotle burrito.  What I noticed most uniquely was the fresh, aromatic and pleasing smell and taste of the tortilla! Sounds strange I know, but it's definitely worth telling you about.  Bottom line: Help this family achieve the American dream, have a meal at Rudy's! They and your mouth will thank you!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!!  The restaurant was 85 degrees or hotter inside. The grill vent wasn't working well so the entire space was filled with smoke and steam. They didn't have straws, napkins or water cups.  The food was acceptable in a better atmosphere. The staff was rude and unaccommodating.  We were a party of five and our food came out one at a time over a 30 minute period. We didn't think that eating at 6pm would be so rough. The seating was horrible and the tables were filthy.   DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT PAIN AND SUFFERING!!!!!!!!  Continuation. While sitting at our sweatshop table we saw 3 people being back to go orders because they were wrong.   Great work rudys staff. NOT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and price. They were very helpful and willing to help you choose the best option. I will definitely be coming back. Street tacos and chicken burrito were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great burritos. Affordable, and fast, consistent service.  Why eat at Taco Bell across the way when you can have a REAL burrito here? Not really the place to take a date, and has a cafeteria feel but heck the food is good, and the prices are even better."}
{"text":"Wont go back. Very disorganized.  Racos were cold and pre bought shells, no better than taco bell. Burro was ok except tortilla was raw, they only flip tortilla for a second and pay no attention to quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Rudy's for dinner last night and as we waited for our food, we watched 3 separate customers return through the door because their to-go orders were missing items or made incorrectly. Now a little apprehensive, the cook called us to the counter to let us know that they were out of refried beans for the side, which wasn't a big deal to us so we took our food as-is. I wasn't impressed with my shredded beef burrito as it seemed to be mostly tortilla, but my husband was enjoying his meat quesadilla... Up until he was stabbed in the gums with a shard of wood. I took the piece of wood to the register and the cashier said it probably chipped off of the tool used to make the salsa. After a moment of awkward silence he asked if I wanted a refund.  He refunded the price of the wood-chip quesadilla and we left, slightly worse for having visited."}
{"text":"Rudy's is amazing there food is the best I have ever had! There customer service is top notch I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Glad to find this place the tamales were so good. It's hard to find a place with decent ones. One thing though is they are in limited stock so they may be out if you go too late. According to the staff you can place large holiday tamale orders a week in advance. The burrito was pretty good too and price was great!"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, great food! Machaca is amazing, and I have never had a better churro then I did there! My family's new favorite!"}
{"text":"SUCH great MX food. Try the pastor... it's what we always get when we're there. I get the taco salad; my man always gets the burritos. Tried a bunch of other menu items and they're all fab. Amazing staff... pleasure to see this crew whenever we swing by for a meal."}
{"text":"I tried Rudy's as a change up for my weekly celebration of taco Tuesday. All of the reviews were good and I looked forward to something non \"chain\". No disappointments. It was very clean and they were extremely friendly. I liked that I got to watch the tacos being made at the counter rather than in the back. I had carne asada supreme tacos and the pollo Asado burrito. Both were delicious. The only gripe was that their prices have gone up recently and the laughably small amount of rice and beans that came with the combo. Otherwise the food was very good."}
{"text":"This is a Hidden gem in your neighborhood.   We haven't found anything on the menu that's bad.  The carne Asada is flavorful and well worth it.  It's a bit of a drive in the East Valley and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could rate zero stars on my experience at Rudy's, I would. When I ordered an ordinary California Burrito and chips with guacamole, I was told, \"we're out of Guac.\" Then I waited for 35 minutes for my order. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great burrito and reasonable prices! I love the breakfast burrito and the carnitas burrito is over the top! The atmosphere is clean and welcoming . I wish they had a drive through:) The only thing that makes it hard is understanding the staff. Very authentic accents. Lol  over all a great find !"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. i came out from LA so i have all the good stuff at arms reach, out here theres not a lot of authentic places, but RUDY'S is on point with their dishes. Thank you for keeping me mexican out here RUBY'S (;"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito!! Had the chorizo and egg can't go wrong.  Red sauce has great flavor"}
{"text":"Don't understand why it gets 5 stars, I ordered steak burritos, it has no flavor. Starch texture, my kids refuse to finish them,  I gave them two stars only because their chips and salsa are good."}
{"text":"This is a true diamond in the rough out in east Mesa.  Amazing Mexican food.  Friendly staff.  Great flavor.  I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place......WOW!  5 stars is not enough...Food is dynamite. I like the tacos. Carne asada is so good. I don't know what they marinade it in but the flavor is so good. The green sauce they use is tomatillo and it makes their tacos even better. Prices are fair. They are not shy when it comes down to the amount of food they serve up. We stayed until they closed. I was really impressed with how they cleaned the kitchen. They don't cut corners. They had no idea I was watching them which makes my review even more impactful. I will provide pictures. Thank you for being so clean. They care about their business and can tell they want you there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Only redeeming factor was red sauce.  The refried beans were tasteless slop.... more like lard soup with a few mashed beans thrown in. Also tasted \"off\"  The rest of our meal (chicken enchiladas) were edible but a far cry from the quality available elsewhere.  Even though the place was not full, we couldn't find a clean table and had to wipe ours off with some damp napkins before feeling like we wanted to sit down.  We went to this establishment because there were a number of good reviews and it's close to the Mesa Swap Meet.  After eating there we wonder if all the good reviews were from relatives and friends, OR if it's changed owners because this place is definitely below average.  Sorry to say another local place we refuse to support."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband after searching for a local mexican breakfast spot and I have to say I was definitely not disappointed. To begin with the restaurant cleaniness and organization showed as soon as we walked in, which is a big plus in our books. We ordered the bombero breakfast burritos which come with chorizo, beans, cheese and patatoes; it does not came with egg, but we added it for our liking. The flour tortillas have more of an authentic taste to them rather than the store bought tortillas . Another big plus was that although chorizo tends to be very greasy I was pleasantly surprised this burrito was not too greasy. All the flavors meshed very well together.  The horchata also was very flavorful with a sweet cinnamon taste. Will be returning the next time we are in Mesa!"}
{"text":"This Mexican food is fantastic. If you have a craving for Filly-Bs but want some real meat and ingredients, your search is over.  Super burrito is highly recommended. So are the street tacos.  Fast friendly service every time I come in this place! A must try."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place especially with all the great reviews. I had a bean and cheese burrito while my boyfriend had the carne asada burrito. I had more tortilla then actual filling and the beans were way too salty. My boyfriend said his burrito was mediocre. The customer service was dismal . We definitely won't be wasting our money here again."}
{"text":"Beware...my credit card was charged more than what I signed for. Looks like they decided they deserved a tip. I will not eat at a place that's not honest about it's charges to customers accounts"}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would recommend. We've only ate here twice but each time it has been delicious! The portions are great & I never leave unsatisfied. It has definitely been one of my favorite places to grab lunch since we moved to Arizona a few weeks ago. Even my Nana who doesn't particularly like Mexican food enjoyed her meal. Great service & good food, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had the Chile Relleno combo.  I've had mixed luck with this dish at other restaurants. The chile is way to overcooked and mushy or not cooked enough.  This was cooked perfectly.  It came with a gigantic flour tortilla, beans, rice and a bunch of salsa.  It was all good.  I'm definitely going back here again and trying more."}
{"text":"The Super Burrito and Taco Salad were amazing. It's a nice small restaurant with a walk up counter. Even if you don't live in the neighborhood, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"In the mood for real Mexican food? Then Rudy's Burritos is the place for you. They have the Best authentic Mexican food around. Carne asada burrito happens to be my favorite."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and love it here! The bean burros are so good! The tamales are fantastic! Everything I have tried has been excellent!"}
{"text":"It seems you only get base model features for a luxury price at Rudy's.   Rudy's Burritos does NOT live up to its hype! These overinflated ratings are proof that the far East Valley is still yearning for a quality Southern-California style burrito joint to deliver great border-town Mexican fancy and spiced-up comfort food at a price that's reasonable. Unfortunately, Rudy's does not succeed in the eyes (and mouth) of this experienced burrito-shack groupie.   I walked into this small eatery with high hopes. I love all shapes and sizes of Mexican food establishments, from hole-in-the-walls to name-brand franchises to street-side food carts. Nothing gets me more excited than a lonely burrito shop squeezed into the obscure corner of a strip mall. On the outside, Rudy's had everything going for it...a basic store front, minimal signage, and a small patio with only a couple tables and some wobbly, weather-worn chairs. Definitely one of my favorite sights!   However, I was thrust back into the world of the mundane once I encountered the unenthusiastic staff of 2 women running the place the night I went. Both women failed to greet my party, even when it was our turn at the counter to order, and with only 1 person ahead of us, who herself had ordered just 1 burrito and a handful of street tacos \"to go\", it managed to take the elder of the 2 employees (the only one actually cooking) nearly 20 minutes to serve the first customer and start preparing our food. Thankfully, we were not in a hurry!  While I didn't go in expecting anything life changing, I did hope for more than the bland, boiled shredded beef and sparsely \"filled\" burritos and tacos we received.  I was also charged for guacamole that they couldn't provide and they refused to give me a refund, even though it was only 50 cents!  Ultimately, there wasn't enough uniqueness at the heart of any of the dishes we tried to make them memorable and the prices felt completely unjustified.  I'm happy to spend double what we spent here on a good quality burrito, so believe me when I say the \"comida\" is not worth the cost!  Between the food, the prices and the (lack of) service, I felt completely cheated out of the unique food experience that I had hoped for.   In the end, the food was average, the delivery was plain, the atmosphere was nearly hostile and both the décor and service were less than flattering.  I left with the realization that I could have spent the same money elsewhere and received better food and a better experience overall.   It's on to the next burrito joint for me..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a GREAT family owned place to get some excellent Mexican food look no further!  This place is awesome from the authentic selection of meats to fill your tacos and burritos with to the handmade chunky guacamole that is made for EACH person as they order it right in front of you!  The owner Rudy himself is always nice and welcomes you with a smile.  The restaurant is staffed with his family members and they are always quick and very helpful.  The carne asada is some of the best I have ever had!  Not much seating inside and they do have some outside but we usually just get it to go and enjoy it at home.  They have AMAZING tamales but don't always have them in stock so don't forget to ask!  Overall this is one of if not my absolute favorite place to get a burrito and some handmade guac!"}
{"text":"Always excellent. Rudy is a sweethart. See you soon. Good luck with your new location"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the shredded beef quesadilla. Only negative is that it sometimes takes a while to get your food because it's all made to order, but SO worth the wait."}
{"text":"Omg what happened to this place? I enjoyed a Arizona burrito here not long ago. I decided to bring my Husband and enjoy dinner. We saw the Angry Crab they opened  in the same place but decided we'll visit it another day, we were so craving mexican food! I ordered the taco plate with enchilada and hubby got the 2 fish tacos. First my plate, the food was cold, taco shells are store bought and crumbled on first bite. I got the carne asada taco and meat was cold. My chicken enchilada was tiny they use the street taco size tortilla. Again cold, three bites all together and it was gone, just as well. The amount of cool beans was a tablespoon smeared out to look like a lot.  The small plates they use, I could still see the bottom of the cold plate with rice, beans, taco and enchilada. The fish tacos look like Van De Kamps frozen fish sticks, gag me! Again he complained about the food being cold. Also same small itty bitty amount of beans. Sorry Rudy I've been to both restaurants 3 times and 2 out of 3 very very disappointed. I've never given a restaurant so many chances, I try to support small business owners. But not anymore. I'm done. I have to tell you IMO you are a Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Came in here because of all the rave reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. I made it a point to come here to try the 99¢ fish tacos and they were gross. The \"fish\" were these breaded but flavorless overcooked sticks wrapped in stale tortillas. Even the salsas here were bland.  I may come back to try the asada but it'll probably be a long while. But I gave them an extra star for having Jarritos & Mexican Bottled Coke."}
{"text":"Went in because subway was closed in the same strip mall. Thought, ok I can always eat Mexican food. We ordered caldo de res and a steak burrito. Thought I was safe with the burrito with it being my first time. Halfway through the burrito I felt nauseous. Caldo was served cold and had to have them warm it up again. Salsas were bland. This place has potential, they need to work on consistency and food handling. Oh and we got 1 tamale to try which was really good"}
{"text":"We been to rudy's burritos a couple of times now. The the food is pretty average there's really nothing special about it, the price is okay for what you get. The inside needs about 25 where you can watch them make your food, overall it's decent place to grab some Mexican food. If you haven't tried yet you should give it a shot you might find something you really like."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!  I love getting red chilli colorado. Great prices and quick service. Always happy atmosphere. Great salsa. Burritos are huge and delicious.  It is our sunday morning ritual."}
{"text":"Three star burrito place.  We drove a while to get here, not worth the drive.    My daughter had a sausage breakfast burrito, and it was kinda puny and tasteless.  I had a chili rellano burrito, and it was soggy.  Would I drive all that way back for one of their mediocre burritos?  No way.  If I was close, maybe I would go in.  On a better note, their green salsa is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"There was a day a couple weeks ago that suddenly, I woke up and wanted to explore east Mesa and Apache Junction.  Why?  I have no idea.  But I am glad I found Rudy's.  Based on the yelp reviews I tried the carne asada burrito which was stuffed full of tender meat and rice, beans, and lettuce.  And also I am very susceptible to ads painted on windows, so I tried an order of the beef taquitos.  The taquitos were light and crispy on the outside and full of tender beef.  So tender I had to tell myself to \"Chew your food, you savage.\"    The young woman working at the front counter was friendly and happy to answer a couple of questions I had.  I look forward to hitting this joint again, either before or after some hiking at Lost Dutchman State Park."}
{"text":"Got hungry for a taco while driving back from the Covalent surfboard factory by the Mesa Gateway airport.  Yelp suggested Rudy's.  I tried and loved the California Burrito which is terrific carne asada with potatoes, peppers and other stuff.  I had them roll it with the red hot sauce already in to make it easier to eat on the go.  Rudy had a steady flow of customers while I was there mid-afternoon so must be popular with locals.  Fairly nice inside for a taqueria.  Looks like it was a new take-out pizza place that went out of business and then Rudy took it over.  I'm sure this is a huge improvement over the previous tenant :-)"}
{"text":"I am a major fan of a family run business and it is quite apparent in the evenings that his boy is on the register while Rudy and possibly his wife is hard at work as well.  I love enchiladas and rudys enchiladas are just okay.  His sauces are delicious but the shredded chicken is not seasoned.  His chips are put in the fryer right when you order them which makes them some of the best I've had.    I keep hearing how delicious his street tacos are so I will try those in the near future.  Yes, this restaurant has its flaws but the effort is there and it is apparent.  I like Rudy's!"}
{"text":"I got the Mexican street tacos. I chose the shrimp tacos! Very good and staff was really nice."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican Food at a reasonable price, look not further...Rudy's Burritos is a family owned restaurant with amazing food.  Their burritos are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"Several of the menu items are no longer available, such as the sopas. Why have it on the menu if not available?  I had the beef chimi, was really good but the rice and bean portions are super tiny.  Rice was bland."}
{"text":"This place is legit, delicious, and well priced.  I have been looking for good Mexican food since I moved here 6 months ago.  This is the first place that I can say I have enjoyed.  I'm looking forward to trying the fish tacos on my next visit.  The breakfast burritos were yummy!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! The service was very friendly and informative. Portions are huge!!  The carnitas and carne asada meat was very flavorful and tender. The super taco is filled with lots of meat and beans. Usually, thats my preference but I think I would get a regular taco next time so the beans don't distract from the meat.  Definitely worth a visit! It went to the top of our taco joint list."}
{"text":"Awesome place... found this by accident and love it dearly... asada burrito no lettuce add cilantro and onion...just like back home....."}
{"text":"Great place to go after a long hike in the mountains! The churros are to die for! I ordered a burrito to my liking..it was delicious....Egg, pico, cheese, French fries, & avocado.... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out the first time yesterday - i ordered the chicken enchilada combo with red sauce to go. It was pretty good- I think I will try the steak tacos next time -they look delicious on the sign. I was a little disappointed that they had all of sides in metal containers in the front.. But the rice was fresh so it was ok. Will try them again in the future."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local burrito and taco shop! My husband and I have tried many of their burritos and have loved them all! They have a great deal on fish tacos on Mondays - and those are amazing too! Their salsa is excellent, although sometime the red one is too hot for my weak taste buds (but I still eat it). I like to pick up a package of their tortillas because they are large and tasty. Make sure to preorder their tamales during the holidays - yummy!"}
{"text":"Was told about this place by a friend.  That they had THE BEST burritos.  My kids and I drove 30 minutes to try it.  The service was very friendly.  My favorite part of the experience actually!  Tried: California Burrito - the tortilla was amazing.  The meat had a bit of grizzle.  There were to many, very thick french fries  Vegetarian Burrito - my 10 year old loved it and finished the entire thing  Bean & Cheese Burrito - my 8 year old was happy  Fish Taco - didn't look that good.  Was like a fish stick with sauce and cabbage.  My son ate the entire thing though  Carne Asada Taco/Crunchy - would not recommend the crunchy shell.  Didn't look as good as the soft shell."}
{"text":"I love this place... The food is always great and made right in front of you... I highly recommend Rudy's for breakfast, lunch or dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating at Rudy's since the first week it was open. I have recently moved back to Seattle after living in east Mesa for 12 years and cannot find the quality and authenticity of Rudy's anywhere here. My family and I have eaten there, mostly takeout, hundreds of times, and never been disappointed. The owner is a super nice guy, and the food is super good. I miss it tons and highly recommend to anybody looking for delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is a review of their Breakfast burrito.   In short , bacon wasn't crispy, potatoes were bland and hot sauce tasted weird.  Regarding the bacon again, it was all pre-made in a warmer with bacon pieces mixed in with the egg.  And there was no cheese.  All for the not worth it price of ~$7.00 after taxes.  I think I paid extra to have potatoes.  The pro- closest breakfast burrito to me.  I would have given less stars if I was able to just review this burrito, but I don't think this experience is indicative of the rest of what they  do.   They can fix this review if they had whole pieces of crispy bacon, some seasoned crispy potatoes, sharp cheddar cheese and worked on their salsa recipe.  I would then happily take down this review and be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Rudy's has the BEST street tacos! Excellent lunch joint, too. We went in 5 minutes before closing one night and they made fresh food for us. Really nice staff, family run Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This has quickly become my go to spot for breakfast burritos. The bacon and the sausage are both outstanding and the tortillas are really good too!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Rudys for over a year and only ever get the sopes. This is the first place I have have been that actually make them fresh and it makes a world of difference. They are amazing and I definitely reccommend this to anyone that decides to eat here. Might sound different to some but trust me EAT THE SOPES!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good and quick for all your Mexican food needs.  They have quality food at great prices!  We come here mostly for the the menudo, but their burritos are good too!  They have vegetarian options too.    The staff is always friendly and the cooks do well keeping everything sanitary."}
{"text":"Rudy's is great. Fresh food at a reasonable price.  Chimichangas and super burrito are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find. It doesn't have a broad menu, but bigger than I expected. The food is not spicy, but it's flavorful. It's better than chipotle."}
{"text":"Always good food at Rudy's.  Tried to run through Taco Bell for something fast.  Then it dawned on me.  RUDYS.  No brainer.  Better food better price better satisfaction"}
{"text":"I like this place. Super fresh ingredients. Authentic southwest style green sauce was great. Everything was pretty mildly seasoned  but It helped in that you can really taste the quality of their ingredients. I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Rudy's has great breakfast burritos. They also have a killer child relleno burrito that I get from time to time. Rudy is friendly and I like eating at a family run restaurant. Great Mexican food out in the Far East valley!"}
{"text":"Wife and I have been ordering burritos to go for a long time. Never disappointed. Staff is very friendly & professional. If you're looking for a real burrito this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Convenient, priced right and delicious! Our go to Mexican food restaurant!  Favorites include Monday Fish Tacos for 99cents, street tacos, rolled taquitos and of course their burritos!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for several years given one evening a few years ago of bad service and attitude of people behind the counter.  Stopped again this Monday for the $1 fish taco special and ordered several.  Service was much better and the food was good this time.  I'll stop again upcoming and hopefully get the same experience I received this last time."}
{"text":"This is by far, our local favorite. My husband manages to go at least once a week for breakfast burritos. I tried their California burrito and thought it had amazing flavor. I find it a tad overpriced for a burrito but at least they don't skimp on fillings. My daughter had the shrimp tacos and loved them. A perfect little spot here in East Mesa."}
{"text":"AMAZING & DELICIOUS. My family and I love Rudy's burritos and have been going there for years now. The employees are very friendly and welcoming and the food is delicious. Everything is made fresh when you order. The burritos and churros are my favorite!"}
{"text":"The customer service wasn't all that great to start off with and the staff was pretty annoyed with the fact that we had never been there before and asked questions. The burritos were stuffed, but were extremely lacking in flavor. Also, you are basically paying restaurant prices, so I'd rather pay the same price to go somewhere else where there is sit down service."}
{"text":"By far this is the best flavorful food you can't go wrong  with anything.  My favorite is the chicken burrito nice and moist.  My second option will be the California burrito it doesn't come with guac like I  like it but you can add it. Street tacos are the real deal here angus beef.  Nice and tender juicy  any ways the reviews says it all with the exception of few haters try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"What a joke! All the food in my party was room temperature and they barely microwaved it when I complained. Very average and room temperature food. Won't return."}
{"text":"Rudy's was incredible.  I have no complaints.  Authentic Mexican takeout at its finest!  We got the red chili burrito with rice and beans.  Both the red and green salsas were spot on as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wooooooow delicious food, great prices, friendly staff. All you could ask for in a food place!"}
{"text":"Well done! This is the definition of hole in the wall good. We had the breakfast burritos and they were great. Lots of options, done well, and the sauces were delicious and not too spicy. It's a long ways from us but we'll definitely be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in east Mesa. Their fish tacos are amazing I don't even like fish and I love their fish tacos."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried here has been really good!  Our favorites are the vegetarian burrito, super burrito and the chips and guacamole. Their rice is so good!!!  We call In our order and by the time we get there it's ready to go!  The employees are always very nice too!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos!  Had the Al Pastor and Carne Asada. Sauces, both red and green, were very tasty!"}
{"text":"Hola amigos!  Ever wish you could find that delicious border Mexican food like you had on that side street in Nogales or Hermosillo?  Have you learned the delicate difference between those rubber flour tortillas they sell in the grocery store and truly well made Mexican flour tortillas?  Wish no longer and welcome to Rudy's!  Real border chow made the way it should be!  They also sell homemade flour tortillas Momma makes on site!  Mmmm!  One of my favorites (and it's odd perhaps for a Gringo), is Rudy's Menudo.  Served with tortillas, onions/chopped cilantro, and lime this is the life!    So, here it is; best border Mexican chow on the east side of Phoenix.  (And don't forget your dozen flour tortillas!)"}
{"text":"Rudy's is hands down the best authentic Mexican food in the area. Always clean, consistent, and fast friendly service. Plus you can't beat 99 cent fish taco Mondays!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I doubt they have anything on there menu you won't like!!! The prices are really awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Oh man I love these guys. The night crew is hands down my favorite! I come here for the al pastor. You know mexican food is all about the ingredients. We all know how to make tacos, nachos, and burritos, but they do it right here. The service is amazing as well which is why they get 5/5. Nothing bad here. Just nice people and great food."}
{"text":"After an early morning dove hunt was craving some Mexican food but not the typical Filibertos or Los Favs. Stopped by Rudy's bc I have seen the place but never been inside. Took a quick look at the Yelp! reviews and decided to give it a shot, no pun intended. They did not disappoint. Food was more traditional, from the quality of the ingredients and I think just the way it was prepared. This place reminded me of when I lived in San Antonio for a few years. Glad I have this place a shot, will definitely be back. Prices are good as well."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this restaurant! It's quaint, fresh and delicious!!  Can't beat the $.99 fish tacos on Mondays either, plus their churros are fresh, comes in plain or cream filled and might I say they both win my vote!! (:"}
{"text":"Rudy's is the best burrito around! Great prices, and their carne asada melts in your mouth! I get the California burrito every time. Their red sauce is my favorite out of any Mexican food place I have eaten at. It's a family owned business and I've personally seen Rudy cooking in the kitchen on several occasions. When I lived nearby I would come here weekly. Now I live further but still make the drive from time to time to get my fix."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Some of the best Mexican food in the East Val. The street tacos are just like the street tacos in Puerto Penasco and the burritos are so expertly wrapped that I have no fear of leakage."}
{"text":"Great food, Great Service, Have been to both locations and food has always been fantastic. Great staff, always pleasant and outgoing. Cant go wrong with their chile relleno or fajita plate."}
{"text":"I have seen this place many times while shopping at Albertsons. Tried it yesterday for the first time. LOVED IT !  I got the enchilada plate & the chicken is so moist, very fresh tasting. Also the tortillas taste very fresh. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. No frills or gimmicks,  just top notch authentic Mexican food. Do yourself a favor and come to Rudys Burritos.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price!!! Definitely not authentic mex but hey I love tex mex just as much as the next guy!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Friendly and Fast service.   Really liked the atmosphere.  Finally have good Mexican food on our side of town.   Found out same family owns a little bigger restaurant on this side of town too that we will be trying this weekend. Will be coming back here and recommending to friends for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good carne asada and pastor burritos. I also tried their nachos, felt like they needed to add something more to them. The chips were thick so they didn't get soggy but the guacamole is like a watery sauce so I had to pay extra for the real chunky stuff in the burrito. The side sauces they offer; red is spicy and kicks you in the throat, while the green is wimpy and has a weird tang to it. I'll try them out again for a breakfast burrito next time."}
{"text":"Best burritos around. Easily beats any of the ***aburtos any day every day. Breakfast is delicious and the Twin burrito is so good we drive from afar to come and get it. You must try."}
{"text":"Decided to veer from our typical breakfast burrito spot and try something new this morning. I must say, this was one tasty breakfast burrito! My hubby and I both had a bacon, potato and egg burrito which came with beans on it as well. I wasn't too sure about the refried beans, but it added a nice texture and another level of flavor along with the perfectly spiced hot sauce. The potatoes were basically French fries, which in my opinion made it especially sinful...god I wish they were open late night for that vodka fueled burrito fix! All and all, we both inhaled our breakfast and vowed to return for more next weekend :)"}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast burritos! Definitely not that average sausage egg and cheese but still super good.We will be back to try the rest of the menu! Glad we stopped by and gave it a chance."}
{"text":"My friend who loves this place recommended I go try it.  Was in the area and needed some breakfast.  I got a bacon breakfast burrito and must say that was one of the best local breakfast burritos,  will have to come back during lunch or dinner and try another burrito"}
{"text":"Their tamales are so good! I miss their breakfast burritos and street tacos as well. Everything is so flavorful and well seasoned. It's the best Mexican food in Mesa by far and I highly recommend it. The only thing to remember is that it's closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"This little Mexican eatery is tucked away in a strip mall.  I only stumbled upon it by having to go to Albertsons.  I wasn't terribly hungry but I can never pass up a taco joint.  The interior was decorated nice and authentic.  They even had futbol playing on a TV which several of the patrons (including myself) were excited about.  I opted for one taco, the Carne Asada Supreme Soft Taco.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy.  Loaded with cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  I topped this bad boy with their homemade hot sauce which was muy bien!  I washed it all down with an ice cold lime Jarritos on the front patio.  Was definitely a good choice to stop in.  I may be back tomorrow for a burrito!"}
{"text":"No bueno!! I dont recommend this place. Its no where near authenic mexican food."}
{"text":"GREAT!!!! it looks like a old subway in a strip mall but the food is very good...very busy when I was there, street taco's are great...4 carne asada tacos $5 other food looked good...a great lunch spot r fr some quick \"GOOD\" Mexican"}
{"text":"Cold sauce gives color to the tortilla but no flavor. Burnt Carne Asada chewy black overly cooked. No forks or napkins added to a togo order and very unfriendly staff. Salsa colored my hands red. Bought a Churro burnt which salsa from(closed container) spilt on, Not kid friendly"}
{"text":"Decent burritos that are large and inexpensive.  I tried the shrimp burrito ($5.50) which had a lot of fresh vegetables, rice, and lettuce in it.  There were a lot of whole pan fried shrimp in the burrito, and they were cooked perfectly.  I also tried a large horchata ($1.89), which was decent, but a bit too powdery/chalky for my taste.  However, I did like that it wasn't overly sweet."}
{"text":"I was hungry, and this place had been on my bookmark list for quite some time, so I figured I'd finally try it out.  The place was clean and the service was friendly.  I ordered the Burrito Asado, and I was pleased with the size of it when I got my order.  I thought the first couple of bites were fantastic, but then as I continued to eat it I realized that it was my hunger that tricked me into thinking it was better than it actually was.  It was like a song that came flying out of the gate, and you waited for it to continue ascending, but it just never really did anything from there on out.  Overall, it was decent and I can't say that I won't ever be back, but it isn't a place I could see myself going out of my way for.   Very nice people that work there though."}
{"text":"Monday is fish tacos for $.99 each (normally $2.69 each)!  Great little Mexican restaurant.  Family-owned."}
{"text":"Asked for a hard taco and got a Old El Paso taco out of the box. Now you would assume a Mexican restaurant like this they would fill a fresh corn tortilla with shredder beef and fry it up, so was disappointed when I saw them grab a boxed taco shell. The machaca shredded beef was good in the taco. I also got the enchilada plate but was very disappointed as had asked for cheese and onion and they only put cheese. The sauce was just bland with no flavor. Tasted like just cayenne and tomato paste thrown together; bleh! Luckily I had some Macayo's hot sauce at home to add some flavor otherwise would have gone directly into trash."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since I moved from California, and I can not say enough that this restaurant have been the only true, authentic Mexican restaurant  here in Arizona... With its fresh tasty food and wonderfully friendly service, my family and I are truly satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon.com deal for this restaurant... I am so happy I did!  They had amazing food and it was super cheap! Get the green sauce, your life will be changed forever! :) Staff was very friendly and the food came out quick!  Churros are good here (most places churros are soggy or overcooked), they had the perfect crispyness to them!"}
{"text":"Rudy's has some of the best burritos around. I eat here for lunch at least once a week. Recommend to all my customers."}
{"text":"RUDY!!! Open a location in Chandler!!!! Okay now that that's out of the way. I haven't been here in a few years but I happened to be telling a coworker about them today so I thought I'd jump on here and put in a review. Even though I haven't been in a couple years I remember it very well. This place is fantastic! I lived on Ellsworth and Baseline when Rudy's opened its doors and my goodness is it delicious! Back then they weren't open on Sundays which was a bummer so its cool that they're now open for a bit. Rudy and his family were always very nice and their restaurant was always clean too. I used to be obsessed with their breakfast burrito and the chicken chimichanga... *drool*. It's soooo freaking good. Plus the portions they gave were excellent and the prices were great too. I now live in Maricopa so I never get to go there anymore which sucks! So Rudy please please pllleeeeeaaaase open a location in Chandler!!! I know you guys would do great here too!"}
{"text":"Rudy's Burrito is a family favorite. They have delicious Mexican food the whole family will enjoy! Some popular menu items include Caldos, Guisados, Tacos, Burritos, and even Breakfast Burritos and platters. Delicious appetisers and a kid's menu for the kiddos! You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I decided to give them another chance. I ordered the wife a chicken chimi and I got two fish tacos for myself.  I can't believe the fish tacos are $2.99 each! They are tiny!!! And the fish isn't even good. Worst fish taco I have ever had and I have tried them from many places!"}
{"text":"Pretty legit breakfast burritos. Tortilla was on point, soft, fresh, delicious and they sell their tortillas by the pack too so that's definitely going down in the future. Only reason it's not a 5 star is their red salsa is not good... at all. It has a really odd taste and isn't spicy... definitely not the traditional red sauce you get at Mexican places. Since I'm totally into red sauce I couldn't give this place 5 stars with a whack red sauce but if you don't like red sauce this place is going to be your jam."}
{"text":"Fell in love  ... I am super picky with my tortillas (I don't like fake tasting tortillas) and carne asada (I don't like when my carne asada looks boiled, gross!), BUT this place passed both. Delish. Def worth a try. Found my new spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late Sunday breakfast & it did not disappoint! I had the ham, egg, bean, & cheese burrito! Yum! I'll be back! They have a burrito bowl option if you want to forego the tortilla."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Everything is delicious, my boyfriend would eat the California burrito everyday if he could. They serve breakfast burritos as well and do $0.99 fish tacos on Monday. Prices are reasonable, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis after work. Their street tacos are always prepared well, as well as their rice and beans. Prefer to put the red salsa on my tacos and beans. Gives them good flavor. Love that they offer bottled coke from Mexico The owner and staff are always friendly. I would definitely recommend if you want some home style Mexican food"}
{"text":"Good, friendly service.  Food was prepared fast, and it was tasty.   I had the Beef Fajitas and a taco."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for Mexican food. Great food. Great price. Always friendly. We love eating Rudy's as takeaway since the seating is limited and we can call it in. Street tacos are good, Chimi's are great, and I love both types of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  Had pork tamales.  Very good.  They looked a little questionable, but the taste was AWESOME!  Good prices for good portions."}
{"text":"Skip Taco Bell that's in the same parking lot and get some quality food for about the same price"}
{"text":"Rudy's is the best Mexican food place in the East Valley! Blows Filabertos out of the water! The tortillas are fresh, the meat is of good quality and the sauce is authentic! You cant beat the price, $3 for a delicious bean and cheese on a fresh tortilla! My fav! Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"First timers tonight and it was wonderful. Tacos are excellent. Super nachos delicious. Love the red sauce!"}
{"text":"Hot sauce, green sauce, how do I choose? For the price and the quality of food, this makes it an easy choice to come to!   Breakdown: Enchiladas: Tasssty! Love their green sauce and sour cream on top. Add some hot sauce for that extra ball of fire in your mouth!  Chimichanga: Love it! Grab it with shredded beef! Street Tacos: Yawn... Burritos: Will get again! Big proportions, and enough to feed two!  What I love about this place is that this is a family owned shop. The owner, wife, and kids run the shop and are very patient, friendly, and welcoming. What also rocks about this place is the price! Burritos that are HUGE for under $5 (before tax). Crrrazzy. Chimi's for $4.50 and Enchiladas for $3.99? Fantastic Prices for the college student!"}
{"text":"I give them a 4 on food taste. The person running the register always gets my order right but the person prepping does not. So the extras I paided for i.e. sour cream, cheese,  etc. gets overlooked and not added. And extras are not cheap here. Compared to other Mexican food places, Rudys charges quite a bit more for smaller portions i.e. beans & rice. And unfortunately, in the summer you can only do take out because they only have the swamp cooler running. It is extremely uncomfortable just waiting for your order. I can't imagine how their staff prepares carne asada over a hot grill :/"}
{"text":"I stopped in to pick up dinner a few weeks ago and was glad I did! Great food! Pleasant customer service. I enjoyed the street steak tacos and they were filled full with juicy steak! My son who is quite picky ordered the shredded beef enchiladas and said they were very tasty. Definitely would recommend them. Always a plus to find a great local family owned business!"}
{"text":"Yeah been here at least 10 times now everything has been bomb, nothing else but some great cooking going on here"}
{"text":"It was good for me. Colorado was very tasty and the green sauce is perfect. Service. Great little place to get some real mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Rudys for a little over a year now and we continue to go back! The best thing on their menu is breakfast! We always get the chorizo burrito and its made to perfection every time! Weve had the breakfast tacos before which are average but it has fries in the actual taco which is cool. We have tried dinner there twice and it was gross! Each time I couldnt believe it! So what Im saying is that Rudys is the best breakfast burrito place in east mesa! Id leave dinner to someone else."}
{"text":"Ahhhh! They have the best bean and cheese ever!!!I drive out of my way for their food.. plus the service is excellent!   TeKeisha P."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I love the street tacos. Best Mexican food I have had since I moved to AZ."}
{"text":"Still a great place to eat. A little further from Los Tacos in AJ (home for me) since Los Tacos closed, i frequent here more often..  It is good.. I want to add that their green corn tamales are GREAT!    their Green sauce seems to be a popular choice here on YELP's reviews. I like it a lot too!  I plan to order more tamales for the holidays! hurrah!"}
{"text":"Had this place a couple times but have not been back in almost a year. The food was above average. It I found the employees to be unhelpful and slightly rude. I asked the lady where the napkins were and she rudely pointed to them like I'm some kind of jackass.   I'll probably try them again soon since I'm only five minutes away. Hopefully they have revised their customer service skills since then."}
{"text":"First time diner.  Taco Salad: with ground beef, no beans, add guacamole.  The shell was perfect. The ground beef and cheese were at the bottom under a mound of finely shaved lettuce. The cheese was white and at first, I thought their was no cheese because it was melted into the ground beef. If there had been more beef and cheese, it would have been awesome, but for $8, this was a serious let down. Chimichanga: carne asada, sour cream on the side, add guacamole. Taste- blah. Very perfect fried outer shell. So much mushy flour tortilla folded inside with a \"where's the beef?\" feeling. Again, the cheese was melted into the meat  (carne asada was great). I think there was some beans???? Lettuce and tomato on the side. I spent $16 total and the best part was the crispy tortilla shell???? Meat and cheese were definitely lacking. I'm sad."}
{"text":"Spicy yet very good red salsa!  Food was delicious n yummy!!  The shredded beef was good in my chimichanga. My wife loved their carne asada burrito. Very nice people"}
{"text":"This place is way better than filibertos, the carne asada is amazing. Try the California burrito, I've never had a burrito taste so good! I'll be a regular now for sure!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars....I gotta say, the carne asada burrito was good..Its def.  not like filib's would put out, this on has sour cream , cheese, lettuce,beans and rice along with the carne asada.  I Have to admit, the asada was a little on the skimply side.. VERY skimpy...   rice was a little stale.. but all in all it was good.  Will try the street tacos next and the shrimp burrito.. Get rid of all the filler foods, give the burrito carne asada.. the little I had was incredible!  almost like americas tacos ..."}
{"text":"First Time but for sure not the last. Had the Al Pastor burro and it was perfect. Great food at a great price highly recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Bomb tortillas. I have a bacon breakfast burrito and it was damn good. Was full all day."}
{"text":"First time was great!  Second time was AWESOME!  Service was quick for lunch, had an enchilada with green sauce - wonderful!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The Super burrito is great but they recently they started charging extra for salsa if you want more that two. Really!!!! Every other Mexican restaurant gives you as much salsa as you want. Bad move Rudy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. There aren't very many authentic Mexican food places near us. And I am always on the search to find somewhere to take me back to my childhood trips down to Mexico. I am a lover of Al Pastor and was greatly pleased to see it as a meat selection for their burritos.   They recommended that I try the burrito red, white, and green style which is a wet burrito with creama, red sauce, and green sauce. First of all the sauces are amazing. The green sauce has a nice zing that hits you up front and the red sauce is a slow burn that hits you on the back end. And the creama is there to cool you down afterwards. I love it. He wasn't kidding when he said I would.   My mother was also especially pleased that the fish tacos are amazing. Though you do get ice burg lettuce instead of cabbage but she said the quality of the fish was amazing. And since it was Monday, the fish tacos were 99 cents a taco. Definitely a place we will be returning to."}
{"text":"Updated review.... I have moved to Texas since I wrote my first review on Rudy's Burritos. My son says we should live here so we can eat at Rudy's every day. (he really means EVERY DAY!) Or we should win the lottery and pay Rudy to move to where we live now. He could live on Rudy's bean & cheese burrito. Rudy is so nice. The customer service is awesome, always has been.I have had several items on their menu, from bean and cheese burritos to chorizo and eggs, to the yummy delcious california burro to tamales that melt in your mouth to.... YUM! Their street tacos are devine... Their tortillas are chewey yummy goodness. I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area and like Mexican food. If you don't like Mexican food, you may stil like it, cause it's that damn good!!!"}
{"text":"Their street tacos are amazing.  I live in downtown Phoenix, and we drive here at least once a month for street tacos...delicious!"}
{"text":"Rudys and the own, Rudy are the absolute best! Breakfast burritos, a must. Street tacos, delicious! Fish tacos on Mondays's, yes please! And to top it off, the Super burrito with chips and beans.... heaven on a plate! And the prices are so reasonable for how much food you get. Don't wait, eat there today!"}
{"text":"The love and I ordered lunch from Rudy's. It was delicious!!! We tried their tacos(carne) and burritos- one with chicken the other with carne- (and no we couldn't finish it all!) The service is pretty fast 5-10 minutes even though other people were also waiting for food. The churros were your standard treat, really sugary! Definitely will be returning! Oh!!! And I forgot to mention.... The Guacamole is amazing!!! We love our chips and guac, and after recently moving out here, we can both say we have found our new favorite mexican joint! They were out of tamales that I was a little disappointed about. But I'll just have to go back and try again!"}
{"text":"Coming from CA, I have my Mexican food that I am used to where it is usually healthy portions.  The burritos are what I would get at this place, but the other dishes aren't as plentiful.  My body needs a full meal while spending under 8 bucks for some food.  I had to pay a little more to get my fill.  Maybe that is a reflection on me than the restaurant...  That being said I still recommend it and will be going back, just need to know what to order next time"}
