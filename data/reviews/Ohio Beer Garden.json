{"text":"Public house style seating and there are games to play at your table. Shuffleboard pieces need to be replaced but also free to play! Have not tried their food here. Cocktails and beer are decently priced."}

{"text":"My husband and I popped into Ohio Beer Garden before our movie last night. I had to fight the urge to go to The Rail, but alas we didn't have a ton of time to wait on food. When we entered we were surprised to find it was a ghost town, with two other people at the bar and one person working. I couldn't believe this place was so dead during happy hour!

We took a seat at the bar and the bartender immediately handed us their beer list and menu. They don't offer a lot of food, just bar snacks and thin crust pizzas. They do have a very extensive beer menu and the prices were excellent. Happy Hour drafts were a little over $4 and canned/bottled beers are always $4. You can't beat those prices! Most of their beers are Ohio breweries. I asked the bartender to recommend a hard cider & he was very familiar with the menu and the beers. He suggested the Rhinegeist Bubbles Rose and it was excellent.

The space would be great for groups. The place truly feels like an indoor beer garden. There are lots of long picnic style tables + patio seating. They also have arcade games and an indoor shuffle board game. How fun!

We ordered the prosciutto & Parmesan thin crust pizza to split. The bartender made the pizza and we were able to watch as it went through an oversized toaster oven. It came out piping hot and devilishly cheesy. Perfect to go with our brew! I loved the thin, crispy crust. A single pizza was perfect for us to split without feeling like we had to roll ourselves out the door. We will definitely be back for happy hour or another pre-movie snack."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night after 9p, and business was slow. Many beer choices, but a little pricy. There was a pool table, arcade games, and shuffleboard? There were board games available, too! I loved the open air garage door style windows. The tables were long picnic style with separate benches. Cavs game was playing on several smallee televisions. Enjoyed the chill, quieter vibe.

Located next to the Rail restaurant and the mall entrance, on the JCP side."}
{"text":"Great concept. Ohio Beer Garden is essentially adult play area section of The Rail. This place has all the popular beers of the local area craft breweries like Platform, Fat Head's, Sibling Revelry and Thirsty Dog as well as those from around the great state of Ohio. A very good selling point is how spacious the area is. Lots of elbow room and the picnic table seating accommodates large groups. The available board games and shuffleboard table definitely enhance the fun factor. During warm weather, the garage doors open up to a patio placed in an ideal spot for people watching! The employees were very welcoming and knowledgeable. Big shout out to JJ, who was the bartender who knew his beer and displayed his knowledge and passion for the craft and company. A very impressive and friendly young man who will do nothing but excel as he moves up the ladder!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you have a group: open space, picnic table seating, board games, and my personal favorite - a hand shuffle board table. No frills...just the necessities: ohio beers, liquor and wine; some food; and good service. You have to go to the bar to order, but they will bring your food and drinks to the table.

Drinks are a little pricy, but the beer selection is excellent. I enjoyed a mint flavored porter and a blond ale...so delicious...I ordered two of the porters!

I didn't get a chance to try the food, but it looked and smelled appetizing.

This would be an ideal bar to go get a drink while your significant other, or whomever, went Xmas shopping and you weren't in the mood yet were dragged to the mall anyway. Or just to meet up before or after eating at the Rail. Or to listen to a band as I did last night.

Last night 90 Something Band played and they were very entertaining. I could sing 90s songs all night, and their variety of song choices were so good. Any band that sings Mr. Jones is on my \"I will follow you to local bars\" list.

Anyway...check it out!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very relaxed and chill, they offer board games and some table top game. Seating is picnic style and they offer food but only certain types like snack food or pizza, you can bring in food from anywhere and drink, Ohio Beef Garden offers all Ohio beers has a nice selection of beers, wines and mixed drinks along with coffees."}
