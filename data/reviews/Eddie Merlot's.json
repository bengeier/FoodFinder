{"text":"ZERO STARS - Tried Eddie M's again. Seating experience unbelievable - BAD. We wanted a table for four - they told us it was fully booked. We left and went to our car and opened on Open Table - we were able to book a table for 10 mins later. Went back inside and said we had a reservation now. Host told us that they only take calls or web bookings - NO WALK-INS! Really - how unbelievable is that logic. 
They sat us outside - table had ants so we asked to move inside. Finally  20!minuets later seated! 
Asked about Oysters - we tried one after 10 minutes ordered a dozen and they were excellent. Service is sadly awful! Meals came at different times for each of us. We were asked if we needed things boxed and the bill before two of us had even been served the main course! Still waiting for my food. This is HORRIFIC. STICK WITH MASTROS! 
Dinner just arrived! 
Not what we expected but digestible!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome staff and a super fun happy hour! We love having some apps and a few drinks after work on Fridays, plus there's really great live music too! The pretty blonde who sings and her partner play a big mix of songs that can really get the mood right. Try the sliders and table side bananas foster for desert, yum!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere (clean, beautiful and classy) and amazing dining experience!  After our dinner & the delicious carrot cake for dessert, we went into the lounge and got to see our favorite singer, Marley Taylor, performing!  We will be back for happy hour on Fridays now that she's here!  They play great music and such a wonderful variety of music, perfect entertainment!!!!  Yay!!!   The bartenders are super nice too, love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place.

Have been for filet mignon three times and just oohed and awwwd every time.

I do have to say that when making reservations, be sure to note where you want to sit.   There is a nice dining room and a very loud bar area where they serve the same menu.   It wasn't our cup of tea to sit in the loud bar area for a really expensive steak dinner, which is what we were given when we went the first time.   After that, we made sure to ask for dining room for the subsequent visits and have had great service there.

Its also great to know that Costco in the Phoenix area has reduced priced gift cards for this restaurant, so I always have some on hand before we go."}
{"text":"Great dinner! My daughter had the petite filet mignon and I had the short rib stroganoff. We shared 2 sides ( Brussels sprouts and cauliflower). All the food was delicious! Our server, Troy, was great and very attentive to us. E had plenty to take home and enjoyed the next night too! The restaurant is very beautiful inside and has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Will not be returning to this restaurant. Very disappointing. We came in for the lobster special I ordered a 20 ounce lobster tail which was a huge disappointment.
Service was just fair. There were only two other tables occupied after an email blast for a one day only lobster special.
I noticed the dining room manager checked on one of the other tables but he never came by our table.
If you want a really great lobster tail, go to Mastro's Ocean club. They deliver on all counts. Service, food, atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a premier steak and wine house! Everything we ordered was fantastic! My favorite was the oysters Rock for starters, and blue cheese chips. The filet minion was out of this world. Our waiter, Jimmy Curvall (bar manager) treated me like family. The carrot cake was killer. My friends and I just had a terrific time! Frank & Heather were very friendly and most accommodating. Thanks Eddie's for a memorable time"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration and it did not disappoint!  The oysters Rockefeller were excellent!  We split the Wagyu steak and it was outstanding. Topped it all off with the Worlds Best Carrot cake!"}
{"text":"We have had 2 lovely meals at Eddie Merlot's with stellar service, but the half price wine on Sunday's is a complete rip off.  The restaurant has inflated the prices of the wine by double, and then suggested that they are half prices on Sundays.  This is not accurate.  They list Prisoner Wine for half price as $88, which suggests that the real price is $176.  The wine lists on a retail basis for $49.  I find this practice to be unacceptable, and it is hardly a way to build customer loyalty.  Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"We dined with another couple at Eddie Merlot's on Valentines Day.  The restaurant is beautiful, the staff attentive and every course we ordered, French Onion Soup, Escargot, Caesar Salad, Pork Chops, Ahi Tuna,  Beef Tenderloin, and Key Lime Pie were all perfectly prepared.  With so many high end steak houses in north Scottsdale, this one outshines them all. We will be back next weekend. Keep in mind the restaurant just opened in January, so there may be some hiccups as noted in previous reviews, they seem to be working hard to make sure these are all resolved."}
{"text":"Typically, I will only author a review if the establishment is either very bad or very good...Eddie Merlot's is both.  My four guests and I experienced impeccable food and service.  Our servers were knowledgeable and exacting, quite impressive.  Ok here's the \"but\"...after dinner we decided to stop for a drink in the bar.  This attempt at service, began with three different people on separate occasions attempting to expand the table size by crawling under the table. Despite our assurances that we were quite comfortable, they continued to ignore our requests.  Twenty minutes and several server visits later, we were without a liquor menu or a drink.  Adjacent tables noticed our dilemma and strange behavior of the server and made comments and palms to the sky sign.  This was straight out of Candid Camera.  As our frustration developed we decided to leave.  Management was cognizant of this and a verbal interchange left one to conclude they were at best indifferent.  After spending approximately 200 per patron one might question management's acumen."}
{"text":"There are no shortages of high end steakhouses in Phoenix/Scottsdale and apparently no shortage of new ones. Located up north at Scottsdale Road and Pinnacle Peak, next to a Sprouts market, this is a bit out of the way except for locals. The fare is classic steakhouse, ala Mortons, Ruth Chris' or Capital Grill and priced competitively, however the decor is much lighter and contemporary compared to most purveyors of prime beef. The service is attentive but not intrusive and the noise level in the dining rooms is easy to have conversations in, compared to places south of the 101 Loop.  This could easily be a special occasions only restaurant, but the Sunday and Monday prix fixe menu ($33 for app, entre, desert) is so enticing, it should have customers those days all summer long."}
{"text":"I just don't know what has happened!  We've been dining at this restaurant from the time they opened.  All of the staff has changed - from management, chefs, servers, bartenders - not a single person who was there when the restaurant opened is still there...it's nice to have consistency and we always enjoy dining with servers and/or bartenders we are familiar with.

We dined on Thursday with dear friends who were visiting from the Bay Area - it was our final evening together and we wanted it to be special.  It was not to be.  When we were seated, we were greeted by a nice Server who said she would be right back and we never saw her again!  Another Server came by and introduced herself and said she would be our Server and another gentleman would be assisting her.  We never saw her again! The gentleman Server came by and asked us for our drink order and if we wanted bread.  We waited 12 minutes for our drinks and never received our bread until we asked for the third time.  Yet another lady Server took our order.  After she took our order, we never saw her again! 
 The food did not come out in the order we requested BUT, the food was very good.  When asked if we wanted additional drinks (everyone's glass was empty), we advised yes.  It was at least 15 minutes before our drinks arrived and that was after my husband got up and went to the bar to see what happened.  After our dinner, we decided on a dessert we would share.  After 23 minutes waiting, we advised the Server to cancel it and just bring out checks.

Love the restaurant decor, the food, the music was excellent Thursday evening but the service is absolutely horrible and inconsistent.  I work in an industry where I recommend restaurants and, not only will I not dine here again, I will not send guests.

This is not the first time we (and some of my guests) have experienced this lack of service.  When brought to management's attention, they really don't care.  

Truly hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"Last night my wife made a reservation days in advance for my birthday. We arrived 10 minutes ahead of the reservation and were told we be seated as soon as possible. 25 minutes later my wife rechecked with the staff and given the same answer. 10 minutes later I checked in after another couple who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. I mentioned this to the manager standing there. He gave me a stock blow off statement that they were very busy and doing the best they could. I asked would he please check to see what happened with these 2 reservations. He refused and started playing with menus, ignoring me, not making eye contact, while repeating the same answer. Totally rude intentionally.

We are locals and have been members of their loyalty program for a couple of years. In fact we got a tour of the restaurant on opening day by the original manager. After this experience we will never return and will tell all our friends to avoid this place like the plague. It is overpriced and overrated chain restaurant anyway."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience. Without a reservation at 5:30 this evening, the lovely hostesses were welcoming and offered us a choice of seating. The wait staff was outstanding. Dinner was the best in the area. I've lived in Scottsdale for 23 years and that the found the menu, quality of the food and ambience top my list of favorites."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new place at Scottsdale and Pinnacle Peak but sorely disappointed with our experience.  The only positive is that the hostess staff when you first enter is exceptional.  The negatives: crowded, extremely slow service, small portions (bar menu) and ridiculously high prices.  With Mastro's, Preston's, and Fleming's all just a couple of miles away, I don't see Eddie Merlot's being able to compete.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and service. For such high prices I expected much more attentiveness from the wait staff. The steaks were less then average, and the sides were over salted and over cooked."}
{"text":"The server was fantastic & that was the best part of the meal.

I originally planned to get the tempura shrimp but changed my mind when I found out they were tiny shrimp & got the shrimp cocktail which was really good.

The filet mignon was average - nothing spectacular & the special potatoes were good but nothing special.  They tasted like the boiled potatoes with cheese melted on top that I used to make for my children.  

Since they have higher price menu, they should get some good butter for the bread instead of that cheap whipped butter."}
{"text":"We went to dinner there last night. The food was very good, once you got it. The hostess seemed confused as to where to seat us (we had reservations) and the waiter was completely overbooked. He was annoyed with us but clearly this was a reflection of his being overbooked with tables and responsibility. Dinner took 2 1/2 hours which is crazy. Again, the food was good. They need better management and more waiters. There are 10 great steak places within 10 minutes of this restaurant. If they want to compete, they have to do much much better."}
{"text":"We were taking a drive in Carefree and happened upon Eddie Merlot's. Outstanding. 
Service was exceptional and the dinner was delicious. We had the prime Ribeye and the Seabass. Wow 
We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service and the wait staff was rude. Save your money and don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Friendly staff, nice Ambience, great meal and drinks. We will be coming again. Steak potstickers and Caesar salad were fantastic. I would not get the shrimp cocktail again though, did not taste fresh. A bit rubbery. But we will be returning since thisis so convenient"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! It was okay. We spent $250.00 before tip and I really only liked my appetizer. Which if heading there get the bbq shrimp- really good. The rest- blah. We have the tomahawk steak which was charred and otherwise tasteless, the eddies potatoes which were so bad we sent back and the creamed spinach- truly the only other thing that was good we ate. We bought a bottle of wine which we served ourselves and when my husband ordered coffee to accompany our dessert nothing arrived but the check. For the money we spent we should have enjoyed it. Even if the food was good the service wasn't worth the $50.00 I gave him. I will never return."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent happy hour first responder at Eddie Merlot's sizable bar as usually I arrive early. They make me feel welcome and comfortable every time. I go often enough to know most of the awesome staff quite well and rarely need the menu now to order from the impressive food choices. They have a great lounge menu for starters, as well as frequent specials including half off select bottles of wine Mondays and Sundays, hope that stays awhile longer. I treat myself to the lip smacking bourbon marinated ribeye with an escargot appetizer paired with a glass or three of wine rather often, perhaps too often?..nah"}
{"text":"This place opens at 4pm and is busy by 4:20PM (in the lounge area). I am usually one of the youngest guests in the place but I love a good wine list! Thursday-Saturday they have live music that I have yet to check out. ALL the bartenders are great but I personally like Anthony...he's been so nice to me from the soft opening to the past two times I've visited. Usually younger girls get snubbed by waitstaff at nice places like this but he treated me with great respect.  The last two times I've been there I have sat at the bar and it was fantastic. Between the bartenders and the patrons I will more than likely start coming here on a regular basis. Remember, it is a high class fine dining restaurant so you will pay high class fine dining prices. Great for a special date night or to pop in for some great wine. I can't forget to mention the artwork! It is INCREDIBLE! (Happy hour- $3 off all glasses of wine. Sunday's-1/2 price bottles)."}
{"text":"Eddie Merlot's, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:

1) conveniently located in the Sprouts Shopping Center with easy access and a large brightly lit parking lot

2) a beautiful and inviting atmosphere that rivals any restaurant in the western world!

3) a cheerful, smiling and enthusiastic staff that greet you the moment you walk through the door

4) the most comfortable restaurant chairs you'll ever sit in

5) live entertainment in the lounge

6) personable and excellent service from the entire staff, but we are partial to lovely Taylor - Eddie Merlot's keeps your preferred server's name on file so you always get the same server (if that's your preference)

7) the potato chips! I could write a sonnet about the freshly made chips. Trust me, just order them

8) the extensive wine list - WOW is all I can say

9) the lobster bisque with chunks of lobster - I asked for EXTRA lobster and they are happy to oblige for a small up charge 

10) the menu - too long to list but suffice it to say, you'll be very happy with the fine selection of steaks and seafood

11) the Management - clearly Eddie Merlot's knows a thing or two about people and they've assembled a professional staff in Scottsdale that ROCKS!

12) the Eddie Merlot Club - what an ingenious idea. You pay 25.00 for a one year membership and immediately receive a 20.00 coupon. The minute we arrived home there was an email thanking us for our patronage with yet ANOTHER coupon, this one for 25.00 for our upcoming anniversary. Once you join their Eddie Merlot club, you'll receive all sorts of perks. I highly recommend joining if you love dining here ... AND YOU WILL!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant! Food was excellent, service was a little slow. The music they had was not really appropriate for a place like Eddie Merlots, and it was very loud. We couldn't carry on a conversation across the table. It would have been more fitting for them to be at a bar or pub, not a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good happy hour selection. We shared a few items, the filet sliders were delicious. Our bartender, Ulisies was very helpful and suggested the bananas foster dessert.....it's a MUST try, absolutely delicious. They are a smaller chain with a really nice wine selection as well. It's nice ribs able to buy a quality glass of wine without having to buy the the whole bottle."}
{"text":"Hubby and I aren't really steakhouse people, but we had to try EM's when we heard about their prix fixe menu for Restaurant Week -- such a deal, we figured, if it's just another Mastro's we wouldn't be PO'd about it.

Well, it turns out this place is a genuine keeper! The food was delish, and there's lots more on offer than your standard giant slabs of red meat and $20 baked potatoes.

And the service...well, it was phenomenal. Really, these people act like they're happy to see you and want to earn your business!

We -- and the couple who joined us last night -- will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this for an early Valentine's Day meal and were quite impressed with everything, from entering, being seated and our server.  We enjoyed a bottle of champagne, I was thankful for our server, the gluten free options and her asking the chef to not put dairy on anything of mine, even our shared veg. I had a beautifully cooked New York Strip and he opted for the Rib Eye, we shared our veggies, but quite honestly, I didn't have any of the broccoli he ordered, because the brussel sprouts were to die for. We forgot them in my car, and I can say they don't smell as good a day later lol I absolutely can't wait for our next visit back.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience, I know we all have choices, but you were amazing and the perfect choice for our special meal."}
{"text":"AH-MAZING! I usually like a livelier place but the food was so good here I didn't mind the quiet atmosphere.  The waitress, Wendy, was phenomenal and the was truly delicious, however, I do not recommend the lobster mac."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!

What a great experience!  Everyone had a fabulous meal, but our server made it eventful.  Denise Rene was great!  She called everyone by name and definitely knew what to recommend.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We heard good things about this place so we decided to try it a couple nights ago.  The ambiance inside was very nice.  Service was good as well.  The issues with this place was the cost of the food and the wine selection offered.  

First the food:  It was good, not great - especially considering that they are charging top flight prices.  Now I have no problem paying high prices at a nice restaurant for great food.  But the food is better at comparable places like Ruth's Chris (which also happens to be less expensive).  So the food was good, just not worth what we paid for it.

Now the wine list:  TERRIBLE.  Not just when compared to comparable restaurants, but bad overall.  Our party had a hard time trying to find a decent bottle of wine to pair with our food.  We sent one bottle back because it was so bad.  We ordered two other bottles, neither was great.  They were passable because we wanted something to drink with our food.  Not only was the wine list lacking, but the markup was insane as well.  Now, typically the markup at restaurants is about double - so if you can buy a bottle at a store for $60, you would likely find it at a restaurant for about $120.  And I get that this is where restaurants make their money.  No issue with a typical markup.  But we knew some of the wines they are offering.  They are $25-$30 per bottle at the store and Eddie Merlot's is charging over $100.  Triple markup.  And the wines aren't even good. 

Verdict:  SKIP IT.  If you are willing to pay this much for dinner, there are better places.  Overall, prices here are too high for what you get.  It's clear that this place wants to be considered as one of the premier places in the area, but it's like they have no idea how to do it.  Every time you turn around, there is another fail that you won't find at a truly great restaurant.  We have taken this place off our list of restaurants to frequent.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to Eddie Merlot's  tonight as we heard  George Hamilton, blues singer plays there. He only plays on Saturday night from 6-10. Very attractive restaurant, fresh and new! Menu looks awesome, my friends had lobster bisque & bread, they said it was awesome. We will definitely go back to try the menu, as it was superior! Sorry, if you are looking for a happy hour, no such luck, but drinks are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Nice venue, waiter, and manager were excellent, wine list well priced. Now the menu was well priced and large.  Ill be back"}
{"text":"Second chances are worth so much...

We visited the Eddie Merlot's in Denver in May and had the most amazing time! Joined their club and the works!! The hubby and I were excited to try the one just down the road from our house. The first time we went our server was fun and very informative, but the food was lacking in flavor. The chicken was kinda chewy and we asked them to make the ahi tuna dinner into a appetizer portion and they charged us the full $33 dinner price. Yikes...I was not happy.

We contacted Brett and told them of our disappointment. He kindly invited us back and asked us to let him know when we were coming in. I really appreciated his desire to make up for the previous experience, but we wanted to be able to make a fair review after the second time. 

We grabbed a shaded high top in the lounge and our server this time was Jimmy. He was fabulous. A great personality and a big willingness to make everyone in his area feel welcome and special. In fact, the older woman at the table next to us got up to use the lady's room and he joyfully escorted her. THAT kind of great server! For him, it's all about the experience and not just the meal. We had amazing cocktails made from the bar staff - hubby indulging in chocolate martini's and me my Hendricks and Tonic. We ordered salads, mine the Spinach salad and Dan's was the beet salad. Both were super fresh and flavorful! The balance of acid and oil was perfect. Dan followed up with crab stuffed shrimp and I chose their HUGE shrimp cocktail for my meal and we split their giant baked potato! It was a really great dinner - everything was presented beautifully and cooked perfectly. 

Being a gluten free girl, I appreciate their bold GF on the things I can enjoy and the chef here was very careful in my food prep. Thank you so much to Brett for inviting us back in. Sorry we never let you know...but this way we could honestly tell people just how GREAT it was! We will certainly be back and for me...it's important to try something a second time before making final judgements."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food.  Came here during their opening week and had a bad experience, but I'm glad we gave them a second chance. They really made my birthday special."}
{"text":"This is a new \"High End\" Steakhouse that just opened in North Scottsdale. They have a nice elegant ambiance and a wide selection of items to choose from. We enjoyed some of the large selection of great wines in the bar then had an outstanding dinner in the dining room. For dinner we had the Wagyu Tomahawk Ribeye, a steak with a Marble Rating higher than USDA Prime. What a treat! It was cooked perfectly and tasted exceptional. Our server CJ was great. For dessert, he prepared Bananas Foster for us tableside, flame and all. Overall the service was impeccable, as one would expect for a restaurant of this high caliber. We had a exceptional and memorable experience. The ambiance, service, wine, and food were all amazing. We will definitely be back again soon and highly recommend this place to all our friends."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've come here.  It was excellent this time as well as last time.  The ambience is very nice and the service was exceptional.  We had an 18 month old with us and they bent over backwards to keep her happy.  Every single person that attended to us was fabulous.  They were running a special of bone in filet and lobster tail, which was well worth the price and it was also half price wine bottle night and we had an excellent bottle of red for half price.  The artic char topped with crab and shrimp...YUM!  Shrimp cocktail was great also.  Creme Brûlée for dessert...perfect.  We could definitely return."}
{"text":"We had not had any experience with this place when they built the Scottsdale Rd location, not far from us. We went in for Happy Hour...drinks are amazing, clearly geared toward those who are ready to appreciate the finer things in life. Grey Goose is the standard in the Lemon Drop. 
Food was fab, calamari, hummus tray and filet sliders all outstanding. We went back for husbands birthday for crab legs, and again for our anniversary for the mixed grille with a cajun flair. All prepared wonderfully. 
Waitstaff and everyone on the floor are exceptional. They go out of their way to make you feel valued and welcome. Professional but personable. 
Ambiance is perfect,sophisticated enough that you can dress up a bit if you wish but jeans would not be uncomfortable. 
This place will do very well here, hope I don't have a problem getting a reservation or a place in the bar."}
{"text":"My wife and went for our 32 year wedding anniversary the other day.
Things started off great, bottle wine, great appetizer, food was very good.
Then it turned,the busboy drops a knife while clearing the appetizer.
So now our table is splattered in sauce,which to my surprise it was now on my shirt.

I mention this to our waiter and the manager to whom had such a caviler attitude about it!!! 

In turn it took about 5 minutes to get Soda water to clean my shirt!!!
 The mangers attitude was its no big deal. REALLY!!!! 
 I had to ask them to cover up the mess, which they were not going to do.

Wow the customer service part was a major FAIL!!

The food was awesome and prior to this going sideways my wife and I were speaking about bringing in clients the following week!

Not even getting a apology they try to sell you a rewards card, obviously our tone has changed we just wanted to leave with zero acknowledgment from the manager as we walk out.

If this is the type of fine dinning they provide it will be our last visit there.

We had planned a very nice evening to be treated like we were invisible after they created the mess!!!

To bad we really wanted to have a memorable experience.

Poor poor customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Eddie Merlot's for the first time last night for our anniversary. It was quite busy for a Tuesday night. The staff was friendly; Amy our waitress was the best! We started with escargot, which was fantastic! The Caesar salad tasted like a \"true\" Caesar salad, yes I got the anchovies! Steaks were well prepared (nothing special; but what you would expect at a fine steak house). The experience was a very good one and we will go back. Ask for Amy if you do go!"}
{"text":"The service was incredible; Jim was amazing! Our dinner was outstanding; the 7 oz filet was perfection. Our sides of mashed potatoes, creamed cauliflower and asparagus were again, cooked to perfection. Then we ordered the carrot cake and peanut butter cup; still eating it; as it is a huge slice. Best carrot cake; so moist and delicious. Also, had the vodka infused pineapple drink; so good. Kudos to the chef and executive chef! We will be back soon. This should have 10 stars; our experience was awesome; from server, to food, to drinks and our surroundings. Great decision to go to Eddie Merlot's~ our first time, and many to come!"}
{"text":"Fabulous . Steak prime ribeye was perfect - a little thin but tasty. Jim the Server was excellent. Cheesecake perfect .  Atmosphere was very comfortable and hostesses were accommodating. Expensive but worth it. Sat outside on patio. They couldn't do enough to make everything perfect."}
{"text":"We eat in the Englewood location several times a month. We were surprised and happy to see Mark & Mike in Scottsdale. They know how to treat customers!! Fine dinning at it's best. Adam was our server. He was awesome...anticipated our every need and exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, service, and atmosphere. Worth every penny! I wish I could have tried more! I will definitely recommend this establishment to friends and family."}
{"text":"Every dinner there has been perfect. Great service. Patrick is a rare gem. Patience. Compassion  knowledge. Great value in every respect"}
{"text":"I ordered the calamari to which the bartender asked if I wasn't sure about the carpaccio also--he said their's was amazing.  Needless to say, I ordered both and he was spot on.  Both were incredibly.
Calamari had light breading with properly cooked calamari--not chewy.
Carpaccio was some of the best I ever had--possibly the best.
Look forward to returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We celebrated my 80th birthday. The food was well prepared and tasty, everyone enjoyed their meals. My twin 6 year grandsons felt welcomed and a children's menu provided a variety of choices to satisfy any child's appetite.
It was a satisfying experience and am looking forward to my next visit.
Thank you.

{"text":"I've been anxious to try Eddie Merlot's, the new steakhouse that's recently opened at Scottsdale Road and Pinnacle Peak in Scottsdale. The décor and layout are very nice, but on the basis of one experience Saturday night, they're still trying to find their legs and have some work to do in terms of the quality of both the food and the service.

We were seated for fifteen minutes before a server appeared to ask what kind of water we'd like and to take a drink order. It was a full thirty minutes from the time we sat down until the drinks we ordered actually appeared--surely not the way you want to begin an evening out.

The restaurant's advertised appeal is that they serve only U.S. Prime hand-carved steaks and so I was expecting an excellent meal. I ordered a ribeye ($47.95) and asked that it be cooked medium-rare. The steak was served on a cold plate; the meat was only lukewarm, and it was cooked well past the point that most steakhouses would describe as medium rare. The potatoes, the dessert and the wine we ordered were fine, but the steak should obviously have been the highlight of the meal and, frankly, I could have done a better job at home.

I really want to like this restaurant, especially since it's only a stone's throw from my house, and so I'll probably try them again in a month or so to see if they're doing any better. But the fact is that there are any number of excellent steakhouses in North Scottsdale where the food is very good and the service is prompt and attentive. If Eddie Merlot's hopes to compete in this environment, they're going to have to step up their game in a big way and in a big hurry."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for dinner this past Thursday and I have to say I was most impressed. We have frequented many of the other high end steakhouses in Scottsdale and Phoenix (Maestros, Capital Grille etc) and this is certainly my new favorite (and very slightly less expensive too!).

We had a bit of a bumpy start - took about 15 minutes to get our water and another 30 minutes before our drinks and order was taken. We were slightly peeved but the remainder of the evening and service was outstanding so all was forgiven by the end of the night.

They have a much more extensive menu than average with some creative combinations that are delicious. For example, I really want to try the bison bone-in rib eye next time we go. We had a few appetizers which were excellent - the oysters were fresh and the homemade cocktail sauce was great. We also had the candied bacon which came with this amazing creamy sauce. For our mains my fiance got the ms7/8 ribeye ($100 amazing price) and it was honestly one of the best steaks I've ever tasted. I had the filet del mar which was a 4oz filet with crab and shrimp. Both were amazing and super fresh, perfectly cooked. We also had the lobster mac and cheese which had loads of huge chunks of lobsters mixed in and on top. For dessert we had the carrot cake, which was good but the portion was so massive it was slightly overwhelming... the cake slice was literally larger than my head. We have been eating it for days! My only gripe is that the carrot cake had raisins in it but that's just a personal preference.

The atmosphere inside is very relaxed but classy, with a modern art deco theme. They also had live music in the lounge area which refreshingly wasn't too loud in the main dining room. 

The service after the initial hiccups was fantastic. I mentioned in passing that I hadn't ever had a cooked oyster and our server brought out two oyster rockefellers for us to sample free of charge - they were great! The server was so charming and attentive without hovering.

Also, the cocktails are fantastic and the wine we had was also great - they have a large selection but it seemed most of the bottles have a higher than average mark up on them.

10/10 recommend for a special night out that won't completely break the bank."}
{"text":"I was hoping to give a five star review. My wife, son and I dined here to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary. My sirloin steak was perfectly prepared and my wife enjoyed her ribeye steak. My son's ribeye was overdone but we did not have time to send it back. The Caesar salads were good and we enjoyed them. The problem was the slow service. We had a good waiter but he kept \"disappearing\" for long periods of time. The restaurant offers a discount card for future meals and charges $25 for the card. The waiter kept pushing the card even after we told him we would think about it. When we received the bill he added the card charge without us telling him to do so. We had him remove the charge. I felt like I was dealing with a pushy car salesman. The very slow service and pushy waiter ruined the occasion for us and my son was very disappointed with his steak."}
{"text":"Really excellent. Steaks were unbelievable!!  Service was outstanding. (Jim was the best).  Definitely a place to experience again."}
{"text":"I ordered the nine in filet and it was amazing.  From the Wine to the dessert unforgettable!  I love this place the staff, and food can't compare Wirh any restaurant in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Mom's birthday is my favorite day of the year! No budget just good yummy food and plentiful drinks! We are a big red meat family and frequent Mastro's and Ruth Chris, Ruth Chris mostly for their insane happy hour!! But anyways! We decided to try Eddie's because it's close to home and we have yet to see how we like their martinis. Our reservation was for 6 on a Tuesday night. We showed up at about 515 for cocktails at the bar. If the bar at a steakhouse is good, then that is the best news ever because chances are you can afford a drink at the bar during happy hour more often than you can afford a frull dinner. So bar. The bar/lounge area is wonderful. It had lots of natural light which happened to be the sunset. The windows were all open, they even have a great patio. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were gracious, knowledgable and fun! As a past bartender, there is small talk which you hate and try and usually can get out of but this is not happened here. The bartenders were all about us being there. We ordered a cosmo, dirty martini, and a manhattan. All were absolutely delicious! Will definitely be heading back to the bar again. The bartenders were still part of our dining experience even after we left the lounge. The bartender sent us over about 6 different wine tastings so that we could try a bunch of different ones. How great. More wine! Love it! Our waiter Frank was awesome! Very attentive but knew tht he was not there as family... it's a tough line. He was amazing! We ordered the ESCARGOT for an app. Delicious but not on the menu! We then ordered meat, lots of meat. I got the trio of filets. Three 4oz filets; one with an Oscar sauce that rocked my world and is now apart of every sexual fantasy i have. The second had blue cheese on top and the third a buttery peppercorn sauce. All were to die for! My mom got the bison filet. WOW! My dad got the Southern Comfort Pork Chops. I know. Pork chops? Really? I know. That's my dad. They were delicious too! We got Brussels sprouts as a side that huge pieces of bacon in it. The whole evening was perfect! I literally cannot say enough amazing things about this place. This is my new steakhouse! Who needs Morton, Mastro, Ruth? Those are now just names to me now. When I want the best red meat or an amazing cocktail that will help me forget the day, Eddie Merlot's is where I will now go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try Eddie Merlots after it was recommended by a friend. We actually went here on Valentine's Day and it was super packed. This was probably only one of the few restaurants in town that didn't have a pre fixe menu on Valentine's Day which was a huge bonus! Being a picky eater, I was impressed with the menu and the vegetarian options. The restaurant seemed to have a good ambience, and I've heard they have live music on certain nights which is always a plus. Even though the food was delicious, it does not compare to some of the other high-end steakhouses in the area. I thought the service was good considering it was packed for Valentine's Day, but it just wasn't on the level it should be for the prices here. All and all, we enjoyed this restaurant, but to be honest you could go to another high-end steakhouse for the same price and get better food, service and ambience."}
{"text":"Not too bad..... Very very slow place..... 3 hours from appetizers to deserts ....... Food was good, choices for gluten free people like myself..... And also vegetarian options. Must try the peach and apple cobbler!!!!
Very pricey.....$$$$$...... So people looking to get in and out on under 100$ should probably dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Last night we had happy hour at the Scottsdale location.   Excellent small plates.  Excellent cocktails.  Great service. Super value."}
{"text":"Here for 34th wedding anniversary. A fantastic meal from Blue Point oysters and albacore tuna to start,  lobster mac and cheese and crab-stuffed shrimp with  a bottle of Moscato to go with it all. 
A terrific experience, we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"In a saturated market of exceptional but very predictable high end steak restaurants, Eddie Merlot's has an atypical menu that is well presented and which pleasantly distinguishes itself from its competition.   

The bison filet, the vegetarian options, and the elk were all uncommon but very tasty options not often found in the typical \"dark hardwood and brass\" steakhouses to which most are accustomed. 

While some had below average service, our waitress was nothing shy of exceptional.  This place is definitely now in our rotation."}
{"text":"Came in to Eddie Merlot's on a Friday night after some friends had been for the opening night and highly recommended it. What a great surprise! Didn't have a reservation so decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by the bartender,Anthony, right away. He had a fantastic friendly personality and poured me a great class of Chardonnay after we chatted about wines! My friend had a strawberry cocktail which also tasted spectacular! After the bartender's recommendation we ordered  the filet mignon potstickers for appetizer and Gorgonzola and bacon crusted steak,which was delicious! Overall a great and lively atmosphere and very attentive service!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this restaurant wanted it to be great because I live nearby but the service, ambience, and food was terrible! We ordered a bone-in ribeye and was delivered a boneless steak 3 different times! The first time it was raw and it just got worse after that. We ordered it medium rare to medium. We also had to have our potatoes returned because they were cold by the time we had our steak delivered the third time. The potatoes tasted like frozen diced hash browns that had been heated up with cheesy sauce poured them. The wine that the waitress recommended was also terrible. She definitely did not have any knowledge of the wines. The waitress must have worked at Denny's before working here. She could also not stop talking. Definitely not the formal service you would expect in this type of restaurant. With the prices they command, the food definitely does not live up to it. Also, the lighting was terrible! Not romantic at all. I felt like I was in the cafeteria. Super bright and light and it did not feel like a high-end restaurant. I won't be returning! Eddie V's or Mastro's is a much better choice."}
{"text":"I hate to only give 3 stars because the food was quite good.  We started with splitting the Merlot house wedge, very fresh and crisp but didn't care for the clumps of fine ground bacon. I had the crab stuffed shrimp and it was amazing. The Ahi that was ordered by my date was also fantastic although not inventive, pretty much standard plating but a very healthy portion. We tried two sides upon server suggestion, sweet potato casserole, very sweet but yummy and the cauliflower au gratin, dry and not creamy at all. Cheesecake for dessert was spot on and classic, just the way we like it. The service was awkward. Jennifer was our server. Very repetitious with info. When giving suggestions she seemed to go on and on and on.... We ordered a bottle of wine from the reserve list, Darioush Caravan cabernet. She was not knowledgeable of the list and her wine service was not professional. Didn't ask about who would taste, didn't offer to decant when it was eluded to that it needed to open up a bit. Had to ask for that service. It was just a bit awkward and she seemed out of her depth a bit. Perhaps more training or focus. This neighborhood has a lot of options for similar offerings with a far superior service presentation. There were many other items we thought sounded good so we'll be back to try again. I'm aware you're new in town so this was hopefully just opening kinks and an isolated experience."}
{"text":"Being from Ft Wayne, IN I was very excited to learn that a new location was going in just a few miles from my home. We made plans to check it out the first week open and just as I suspected it didn't disappoint. As any brand new restaurant people are learning and adapting. However, the service from start to finish was top notch. From the friendly valet to the hostess, servers, and management. I will 100% be making this a regular spot. I've been slightly disappointed with other fine dining restaurants in the area so it's nice to finally get perfection on my steak."}
{"text":"Nice place and bar.  However, two complaints:  there's \"live\" music on certain nights in the beautiful bar area and some of it's good, but sometimes pretty bad. 

Second:  your FB page has a tribute to Veterans on Memorial Day, which I totally support and understand your decision to be closed to honor our Vets.... But it might have been helpful to add a post that the restaurant was closed on Memorial Day (or any other Holiday throughout the year) to honor them so customers know.. Phone message did not indicate closure either."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!!  Servers need to learn what an upscale dining experience is!!  Waited so long for our bread that the main course arrived at the same time. Shrimp appetizer was not even cleaned properly!!  After steak arrived---server never returned to check if it had been prepared correctly!!  This should be basic server knowledge!!  Never asked if we wanted coffee with our dessert!!  Portions on sides are very small--embarrassing for $10.00!!  Terrible service and the place wasn't even busy on a Saturday night!!!  Don't waste your money or your time!!!  Much better steak houses around !!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner her finally after eagly watching the place go from empty space to full on restaurant over 6 months.

We both love steak. they have a large selection of wagyu, signature steaks and aged steaks. This rip we ended up sharing the Greg Norman Wagyu. It was perfectly med rare and delicious. Their bread is very nice with a good crust on it. I did wish that they would offer real butter for the bread instead of the wiped imitation spread they gave us.

We shared a caesar salad. I thought it was great, but my wife thought it was \"just ok\". We also had the blue cheese home made potato chips. Wow, HUGE portion or really good homemade chips. Really really good. We don't drink so we did not have wine, but the wine list looks very extensive.

Out server, we sat at the bar because we did not have reservations, was excellent and explained the menu and answered all our questions. He also told us about Eddie Merlot's frequent dining discount which seemed to be a really good deal and i would suggest that you look into this once you go to the restaurant.

We were stuffed from the excellent beef so we did not have dessert, but we did notice hat it had many fine items that we will try in the future.

Service 5/5. We both given it 4/5 for the food for 4.5/5 overall."}
{"text":"The interior is very nice and upscale. The inside temperature however was quite chilly. Maybe when it's full inside it's warmer, but that wasn't the case when we dined. 
The food was great. We ordered the sesame calamari, which had a tasty breading. Next we had the roasted beet salad, which we split because normally salads at steakhouses are decent in size. This was not the case. When the salad showed up, we both laughed, saying is that it? Did I suddenly show up at a \"tasting\" restaurant..?! Yes it was that small. I've never seen a smaller salad, lol. Anyway, it was very good, but would have liked more of it. Then I had the bison filet mignon, which was excellent. It was a great cut of meat. The doneness wasn't quite perfect, as it was a little rarer and cooler than I would have liked, but excellent flavor nonetheless. The hubby had the ahi tuna, which he said was very good, but not excellent. We also had garlic mashed potatoes- which were good, albeit a bit on the thick side and quite small in portion size. 
For the money and portion sizes, we'll probably just go to Mastro's next time. When you pay $10-13 per side at Mastro's, you know you're going to get big portions and it's consistently the same every time. Also, our service at EM was slow - we did a lot of waiting around for the waitress which definitely takes away from the experience. We've never had that happen at Mastro's. So those are the reasons we'll probably just go to M's next time."}
{"text":"I will make this short and sweet, our dinner last night was Very good from the Chopped salad to the Sea Bass and Filet Mignon, (both cooked to perfection) The sides, mushrooms and their scalloped potatoes were so so. The only issue was our waiter CJ, he waited until we were 3/4 thru our dinner to check on us, did not ask if we wanted another drink, and paid more attention throughout the service to the neighboring booth."}
{"text":"I had this bookmarked for a while after reading great reviews... was really looking forward to checking it out for myself!  The menu was a little different than what was online, which was a pleasant surprise.  So much more to offer than just steak & sides.  

We started out with the barbecue shrimp - AMAZING!  Jumbo shrimp dipped in horseradish, wrapped in bacon, grilled & coated in a tangy barbecue sauce.  Great alternative to the traditional shrimp cocktail, which also looked fantastic on the table next to us.  

I opted for the New Orleans mixed grill, which was almost like a deconstructed gumbo.  A 4oz filet, 2 grilled shrimp, Andouille sausage & mashed potatoes was an excellent combination.  Just the right amount of spice!

The service was impeccable, the wine list was extensive... overall great experience.  Will definitely return to try the Wylarah filet!"}
{"text":"We went to Eddie Merlot's - first time for us in Scottsdale.  What a wonderful experience, the service was awesome and the Steak & meal was the BEST.  Jeff the Manager has a great team working with him, we will be back."}
{"text":"Date nite, I ordered the bone in bison, he ordered the meat loaf.   Both excellent, had 2 drinks at bar first.....as mentioned from a previous patron, bar takes too long.  Food from kitchen to table needs to shorten by at the very least 30 minutes.  

Excellent food, our server Oscar was great and very informative.

Time is the only issue!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is very nice, service is impeccable.  The happy hour menu consists of them taking 3 dollars off the item.  The food was good, not great, same with wine selection, good, not great.  I elected to have cocktails instead.  I found the cost of the food and drinks to be very high and not worth it.  We love Happy Hour on a weekly basis, but Eddie Merlot does not offer any value, and the food is not exceptional enough for us to pay the high prices.  There are many other better  competitors to chose from."}
{"text":"Good drinks, and exceptional food, everything is catered to your specific tastes, and they don't make you feel bad about it! Always ask for Ulyses at the bar;-) it's a steak house, so go for the MEAT!!! Their temperatures are right on if you care about the difference between medium and medium-well, plus I'm a regular and get the best service!"}
{"text":"Are these employees too nice? Yes. Obviously something must be wrong....their politeness transcends what is required. But I will overlook this flaw because the food was delicious and the live music was delightful."}
{"text":"This review is on their customer service & menu 
Items.  I felt a personalized and humanized touch when reaching out to Eddie Merlot's to make a reservation.  I feel like I got a taste of their \"WOW\" factor they say they have with their service! 

I contacted them on FB since I was not able to find their new Scottsdale number & they just got a yelp account as of yesterday.  The customer service rep answered my email within 5 minutes which was nice & got us all set up for tonight gave me contact info & was so courtesy.  So far I'm very much liking this place. 

I thought this was nice.  Apparently this meat come from Australia!

{"text":"This was one of those experiences I will mention to everyone I meet..A real surprise and pleasure...we started dinner with the sesame coated calamari... Generally I don't like deep fried, breaded calamari, but this was different... The coating was very light, the calamari was tender and perfect, served with 3 sauces..Then I had the Sea Bass..again the fish was tender and perfectly seasoned..My partner ordered the 6 oz Bison Filet, garlic mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese....We were so thrilled..everything was just right...I love to cook and am generally picky about quality and have been known to say, \"I could make this better\", but this time, I will truly say. 'Excellent \"!!! bravo.. The ambiance, the staff, the food, everything.. This is a 10 out of 10.."}
{"text":"Such high expectations for such a mediocre experience. Overpriced for what was delivered. The service was mediocre with an over attentive wait staff, who clearly was trying to up-sell whenever she was asked for a recommendation. My husband and I decided to try Eddie Merlots as it  is close to home. We ordered the sea scallops, trio of medallions, Eddie's potatoes and Brussels sprouts. My husband ordered his steak medium rare. Each of the three steaks were cooked differently (one medium-well, one medium, and one medium rare, as ordered) The sea-scallops were rubbery and over seasoned, the Brussels sprouts were undercooked. The potatoes looked and tasted like they came from a microwave package with a cheap cheese sauce. The best part of our dinner was the over priced wine, the bread (that was clearly a frozen, proofed, chain version) and our dessert coffee. I could have cooked (and have done)  better entrees myself. For $200, Eddie Merlot's under delivered. If you want a fabulous dinner please go to Costco and cook yourself, or spend your money at Fleming's, Maestros, or even an Outback Steakhouse!!!!!!! What an absolutely disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Terrific food and service. I have now been to this establishment about 6 or 7 times and each time the food has been consistently good. The staff went out of their way to make our dinner wonderful--a great night out!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Eddy Merlots', fantastic food, service great, Marley Taylor and Chris were playing everyone singing and dancing. A great time was had by all. We will return. A must try in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've now been here 3 times and will not be returning food is not that great and service Is mediocre all three times very disappointing."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very classy with contemporary décor, lots of artwork and a nice color palette.   We had dinner in the lounge (ordering off the lounge menu) and loved the food, the service and the atmosphere.  Our waitress was friendly, helpful and very professional.   The food:
- Tempura Green Beans - tender beans with crispy tempura coating.  Delicious!
- Tempura Shrimp Tacos - Lots of shrimp, great flavor.
- Beef Tenderloin Tacos - Good flavor but the meat was a dry and over cooked.
- Carrot Cake - Wow!   Huge piece could serve 4.  Very moist and lots of layers sandwiched between cream cheese frosting.    

We will definitely be back.  There are other items on the lounge menu that sound delicious and of course we need to try the regular menu as well."}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant was a disappointment. For this amount of money, there are a lot of better places to have a steak in Scottsdale. My first hesitation was that it is located in a strip mall.....outdoor seating has a neon urgent care sign to look at. Valet attendant asked us what time we would be leaving, as he didn't know what to do with our keys if we left after 8 PM. The front desk was confused about our reservation as well as a line of others waiting to be seated. They seemed nice, but young and inexperienced. They left us waiting in the middle of the restaurant to figure things out. Our waitress was almost too friendly, cracking jokes and not particularly attentive in general, but trying to make up for her absence with artificial humor......she tried too hard and laughed too loud!! The food was mediocre at best.....nothing to remember other than the overpriced rib eye steak that was thin, tough and grisly. Two people in our party ordered salads and appetizers.....not bad, but not great: overdressed soggy Caesar and a pretty good beet salad. Other side salads were large, but ordinary. There was nothing about this restaurant that would make me want to return. Poor location, inexperienced hospitality and waitstaff, over priced food without much imagination. Wine list was not remarkable nor did it offer many interesting wines......predictably boring and no sommelier. No decanter to allow for the red wine to open up. Our waitress brought the wine and simply poured it without allowing anyone taste it!! White wine by the glass was a small pour, about 5 oz. $100/person should offer a much better dining experience. Try Dominic's at Scottsdale Quarter!! Their steak is pure gold!"}
{"text":"Beautiful upscale steakhouse, great food, wine list, atmosphere and five star service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for Happy Hour this week. What a disappointment! They call it \"Happy Hour.\" I call it \"Unhappy Hour.\" Nothing on the Happy Hour drink menu except $3 off  already overpriced glasses of wine and a few cocktails. No beer, no mixed drinks, ...Nothing! Needless to say the place was virtually empty except for about six people at the bar, including us. We have never done this before, but we left without having anything. We scooted up to Prestons which was hopping during Happy Hour, and rightly so.  It was great! Save your money! there some really good Happy Hour places here in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The Tomahawk is now on my top 5 list...

My Rib Eye was seasoned to perfection, grilled to my desired medium rare and is now on my favorites list. 

The sides are not to be missed, sweet potato casserole was insane....

My table was all raving over their steaks and sides. The restaurant was also fun and well lit with a great wine selection. 

Service 5 stars
Food 5 stars
Drinks 4 stars
Atmosphere 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"We loved the food and the ambiance. Our server who we have met outside of his work and is an amazing person: mr Jimmy from Ohio was really polite and accommodating. He treated us like family and we sure love the place. The interiors were stunning too"}
{"text":"We frequented Eddie Merlots in Burr Ridge IL when we lived in Chicago and now live here in Arizona and still love this place - Our server from Burr Ridge, Jim V, now lives in Arizona and is now a server in Eddie Merlots in Scottsdale. Love this place for their food, service and atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Had the burger which were some the best I've ever had. Service was amazing. Server very knowledgeable about the details of their ingredients. Very respectful, personable and fun. We enjoyed it so much we'll be back often"}
{"text":"There are a whole lot of steak restaurants to choose from in the Valley.  They are literally all over the place from one end to the other.  Well, add another one to the list.  Eddie Merlot's is as good as all of the rest of them.  Great food, quality cuts of meat, basic and unique sides.  The best part is the staff.  Ultra-attentive.  I glanced around and was instantly asked by the staff if there was anything I needed.  I just said I was admiring the decor.  If you are lucky, ask for Troy (the Ninja).  He anticipates your needs and like a Ninja, poof, there it is.  Enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Above average service, not perfect, waiter was insecure about menu and wifi password, the lobster bisque was probably why I would give this place 4 stars, the bison filet mignon was perfectly cooked on the inside, but a little hard on the outside, baked potato was way  undercooked, probably why only 4 and not 5 stars, desert was awesome! Hope you enjoy this place!:)"}
{"text":"Second time here and decided to stop in to try out their happy hour. The HH menu is great! We ordered the steak Diane (so good!), shrimp crostini (meh), blue cheese potato chips (yum), sweet and spicy shrimp (not on HH but worth it). We also learned they currently have a summer pre fixe menu so we decided to try it and omg what a good deal! We got deviled eggs (3), TWO bone in pork chops, and carrot cake for only 32.95. This place isn't only beautiful but the food is superb and the staff is fantastic."}
{"text":"We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door by a  lovey hostess.  We had no reservations; she asked if we wanted to sit in the restaurant or bar area which features the same menu. We chose the bar area which was more crowded than the restaurant where one table was filled. Our waiter greeted us by our surname which he must have received from the hostess - very nice touch. 

The waiter was very helpful and attentive. After taking our order, he said he had an emergency, had to leave and the manager would be serving us. The manager did a fantastic job. We ordered the Elk Chop which was a la carte, Brussels sprouts with onion, Parmesan cheese and bacon, served family style, Cesaer and Merlot iceberg wedge salads. 

The Elk Chop was cooked in a mushroom and onion gravy reduction. The meat was done perfectly at medium rare and very flavorful, the gravy was very light.  The salads were a nice portion and very fresh. The Brussels sprouts had a char to them which added to the flavor. 

Our bill was $150 before our tip. I believe this restaurant is 4  $$$$ and not 3  $$$ as listed. Overall, our experience was great and so was the food. Not a place we'd frequent on a regular basis due to the cost."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner here with an out of town coworker who wanted to try somewhere with great steak.  The steak was delicious as was the salmon.  We also tried several of the Eddie Merlot wines and were very pleased with the taste.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed the shrimp and steak tacos along with the shrimp dish has been taken off the menu! Manager says they re did the menu and these items are no longer in the menu or the happy hour menu! I hope they reconsider their decision!! The tacos were the bess ever. 
We ordered the new shrimp crostini  which was delicious and a nice portion! We also opted for the beef stroganoff. Quite the bomb! Delicious!! Came with a huge side Ceasar salad!! Great wine!

Also the manager and waitress were very accommodating making sure we were happy and please with everything from drinks to food! We will be back!! And hoping they add the tacos back on the lounge menu would be a huge plus!!"}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area with wonderful live entertainment.  Thankfully we were not in a hurry and didn't mind waiting (20 minutes for bread, 30 minutes to order and 90 minutes for dinner to be served from the time we sat down).  Wonderful food and wine flight (red wine Caymus, Gaja Promis, Duckhorn) which was a really good value.  Had the 3 course special and it was great.  Basically spent half of what we would pay at other local steakhouses, just had to have patience for the slow service.  Noticed a number of references to similar issues in other reviews so not an anomaly."}
{"text":"The food and service here are both top notch! I will definitely be coming back. They have a steak selection that is out of this world. The oysters are served with a champagne mignonette sauce that really takes the oyster experience to another level. I also was super impressed with wine cellar and the ambiance of Eddie Merlot's!"}
{"text":"Still disappointing at best.

Staff gathers at end of bar in their personal conversation....ridiculous one needs to wave them down for beverage"}
{"text":"This place has good food and a great bar. The only draw back is the music/singer in the bar is too loud. It is hard to hear the person sitting next to you and have a conversation. The music is good but just needs to be turned down, it is too loud for the size of the space."}
{"text":"Elegant and upscale Eddie Merlot's is a great place to go for date night or stop by the bar and grab a drink and some appetizers.  We visited the restaurant in the evening and everyone was fairly dressed up creating a formal atmosphere where people were laughing and having a great time. We sat on the outdoor patio that had an amazing view of rock formations and the beautiful Arizona landscape.  They had heaters mounted on the ceiling to keep you warm when the sun went down.  Our group decided to just order appetizers this visit and they have an extensive selection to choose from.  Many times when you order appetizers they are pre-made and tend to be greasy or salty but not here.  The spinach and artichoke dip was creamy but not too rich and it came with house made pita chips.  The tempura green beans and home made potatoes chips were a slam dunk but my favorite out of all of them was the calamari.  They had three dipping sauces for you to create just the right mix of sweet and spice.  They have a house made bread that is served with dinner that was amazing as well.  The restaurant had a very talented Sommelier Jimmy that helped choose just the right wine to bring out the best of the food to further enhance the experience.  They do have a separate menu for the bar area with additional appetizers and finger food if you are just looking for a place to hang out and not commit to the full restaurant experience.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal and an amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried Eddie Merlot's for the first time this week. Solid service and food in a warm, comfortable setting. They've just expanded their patio/happy hour area so we'll go back and try that. Great booth seating too. We'll be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Easter Brunch was amazing. Staff was very friendly. Wonderful restaurant will definitely be coming back again. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!  First class service from hostess to bar tender.  Hostess escorts you even when going to the bar and assisted me in finding a seat at the bar.  

We only had appetizers: filet mignon potstickers and The crab/avocado salad...both delicious.

Marly was playing so of course the music was good.  Will be going back with my husband."}
{"text":"Would warrant five stars, except for having to wait to be seated for more than ten minutes at 6:30 p.m. on a Wednesday evening when the restaurant wasn't very busy, and then being led on a circuitous route to our table just behind the hostess stand.  We had requested a quiet table, which meant that we were close to the kitchen entrance, rather than in the more lively bar/terrace area.  

Tod was a great waiter.  Aperitifs were excellent.  We all chose steaks, served perfectly cooked on steaming hot plates, with good side dishes.  Wine list is extensive without ridiculous mark-ups."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Service was impeccable. Jim V. Made our night very pleasant and enjoyable. Food was cooked to perfection. Overall, wonderful experience from the service to the food!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for Happy Hour, our second visit.  

The good:  As expected at a high price full service restaurant, the drinks, service and decor were all great.  Tempura green beans also super.

This time most of our group of 8 had the prime burgers.  All agreed the burgs were pretty tasteless.  One was sent back due to a big blob of gristle.  I didn't finish mine as it was so dry.  If you drive just down the street to Pima and Pinnacle Peak at Prestons, you can get the drinks, service, decor and a fabulous, tasty burger or one of the best steaks around.  I don't work for Prestons, I just really like their burgers!!

Don't go in a group.  It's really loud."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant and we had a wonderful time.  We ordered the beet salad with goat cheese for a starter and it was excellent.  The crab cakes had a high percentage of crab and very little breading and were dinner size portioned. and Our server Wendy had some wonderful recommendations for our mains.  The scallops with blue cheese, pecans and raspberry sauce were outstanding.  When you order the scallops you receive a good 8 oz worth.  The braised short rib stroganoff was also very good, although I would have shredded the meat on top as a future recommendation.  We will be back next time for the band which plays Friday's and Saturdays.  From what we could hear they were quite good."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Very slow service, no sense of urgency in staff. Mediocre flavor in ribeye . You can get much better steak in flamings or mastros."}
{"text":"We come to Eddie Merlot's once a month and bring all of our friends into the lounge for dinner & drinks to see Marley Taylor sing!  Thank you EM for the great entertainment-Marley & Chris are great!!!  Ulliyses at the bar is always wonderful too, and Orestis always makes us feel right at home!  We are coming in with a big group, to see Marley on the new patio, can't wait!  Fine dining and fine entertainment, love it!!!"}
{"text":"Overall our experience at this restaurant was very good.  I had to give the waitress a 3 star for the following reason.  One person in our party ordered the surf and turf.  There was some sort of a mix up and he did not receive his surf until after we had finished most of our meal.  I was very surprised that the waitress did not offer to take it off the bill or to buy a desert, or anything.  I understand that things happen, but in my experience at a restaurant of this caliber, something should have been offered.  We also had the Chatauebriand which was slightly overdone, not enough to complain but........... two things being wrong was certainly not expected.  The service otherwise was exceptional.  We look forward to giving it another try!"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed our dinning experiences 
Enjoy the atmosphere and service very much
The food has been excellent
Can't say you'd go wrong in anyway"}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse in town I don't really eat seafood much but the shrimp cocktails are amazing, the drinks, the steak, everything is grade A I recommend it:) Ulises and Josh are super friendly and the servers are fast and very amazing people I'll be going here all the time :)"}
{"text":"Two stars only because the restaurant is attractive and comfortable.
After three visits we have not had even close to a good dining experience.  Tonight my entree was a Siberian salt mine and my wife said her crab cakes were like mush.  The couple we were with echoed our sentiments. Service is chain restaurant cliche \" Are you enjoying your wonderful dinner?\"  
I usually have a two strikes and out on new restaurants but I gave them three - my mistake."}
{"text":"My wife called and they said they had room at the bar for drinks and appetizers.  When we arrived, we went to the bar, and a VERY rude hostess said to us, \"These seats are reserved!\"!  

I told the manager how rude his staff was, and he shook his head like he could give a damn!

What these clowns need to understand is that most folks in North Scottsdale, including me, could buy them over 100 times!!  You are a guest in our town!!  

Spegia is a much better option across the street!!  Very friendly!!  Amazing menu and great cocktails!

00000 to Eddie Merlots!!  Go back to Chicago!!!"}
{"text":"Eddie's has done a great job. We had a Fabulous dinner last night. The service was perfect! The food was delicious. There is a nice selection on menu. They have great wines to choose from and yummy desserts. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"My wife got the veal, but there was no indication that it was not traditional. It was 'breaded' and pan fried, not just in butter and lemon. The drinks were good and they did a small Creme Burlee for her birthday, and the Filet Trio was excellent. 
But we left not feeling impressed as she was disappointed in the veal dish."}
{"text":"Ok, yes it is a chain, BUT this particular location I must say I was impressed by. We sat on the patio over looking the desert as the sun was setting and it was beautiful. There was live music which was nice. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and memorable. The food selection was just right. (Some steakhouses have too much on the menu and others don't have enough). I ordered the lobster bisque which I do wish had just a little more lobster in it but it was very tasty and the crab stuffed shrimp was delicious and the portion was just enough. I do like that as soon as the sun went down the heat lamps were automatically turned on without having to ask as by this time we were the only ones left on the patio. We ended up paying for one of the cards that they offer for future visits. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I was privileged to attend a mixed sponsored by a local magazine at Eddie Merlot's last week.  The place was packed, and for good reason.  Great food, great people and great atmosphere.  While the $100 steak was a bit out of my price range, I found plenty other more reasonably priced options that were very tasty.  Well done!  (The company - not the steak!!)"}
{"text":"Classy, large wine selection, nice bar, table cloths, excellent team serving, seats 300 plus and several rooms with outdoor seating. I had visions due to the decor, prices, management and serving style of unbelievable food. Unfortunately the two items I had were disappointing. I will go back one more time and hope for the excellent quality I was envisioning."}
{"text":"We had a very nice evening at Eddie Merlot's. It was a beautiful night to dine outdoors. The Sea Bass was delicious. (I did not have it with the offered preparations, instead I had it without the maple or balsamic.) My husband had the Ahi, which was delicious as well. The Caesar salad is good, nothing special. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place surpasses Mastro's in quality and service. We also have been to Preston's and the other comparable restaurants. Service is fast, consistent and quality. The Australian beef is our favorite. Bananas foster is amazing. All of the sides are incredible. This is our new favorite spot over any other steakhouse in the area!

Update - have since been 3 more times. Service is consistently excellent! They have a nice lounge and music as well. 5 stars every time."}
{"text":"We booked this place for Valentine's day this year and were very excited to try some of the items on the menu. All in all, the food was great! The decor seemed dated, however. Not old, but just designed as though it were over a decade ago, not like a modern steakhouse.

The service wasn't anything special for a steakhouse of this caliber. One disappointing part was not being told what they were out of, so I had to find it out the hard way by getting excited about something and ordering it before being told they had run out.

After starting with the crab cakes, I had the Prime Ribeye and my girlfriend had the stuffed shrimp. We shared the lobster mashed potatoes and cauliflower gratin. Everything was cooked perfectly and was delicious, even as leftovers the next day.

Although the food was great, if I'm going to a steak house in this price range, I would prefer to go to others with a better atmosphere and a little more top-notch staff."}
{"text":"I recently had an incredible experience here. A group of friends dragged me out to dinner and this is the place they chose. The interior is absolutely amazing, beautiful artwork hangs all over every wall, warm lighting with a mixture of a classical and modern vibe! The service was top notch (they even have people come by with little razors to scrape the crumbs off the table), the bread was fluffy and amazing, and the food was incredible! Try the carrot cake!"}
{"text":"Eddie Merlot's has been open for a while, but it took me a while to try it, maybe because the strip mall setting isn't always inviting. The inside is nice, not the typical dark steak house but much brighter. We went on a Monday night and the service was superb.  Our bill said Wendy was our server although neither one of us remembered that being her name? But I may have been delirious from the best french press of my life...but I will get to that.  We started with the smoking shrimp cocktail which was divine.  One of my favorite things about their menu is how diverse it is. They have many steak options, including a tomahawk ribeye, a nice assortment of seafood, and then options such as braised short rib, vegetarian gnocchi and even meatloaf.  What an easy place to take a large group of people.  Everyone will be happy. My dinner date had the bison ribeye and LOVED it. I had plans to have steak but the blackened sea scallops caught my eye- and my heart.  The scallops are in a raspberry sauce with blue cheese, honey and pecans!!!  It was so heavenly.  They offer the typical sides that steak houses offer. We chose cream style corn and creamed spinach and we were not disappointed. That should have been enough but their dessert menu is filled with too much to just end the experience here.  So on we went with the biggest piece of moist, delicious carrot cake.  And they did not scrimp on the icing. They make it in house and it really is a huge piece so we brought most of it home. And the aforementioned french press was served hot with whip cream, chocolate chips and cream and sugar on the side.  Just lovely! The prices reflect a nice steak house so we won't be here every night, but I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent Steak and Seafood! Bone in Filet is amazing!! Also the sweet and spicy shrimp is excellent!!! One of my favorite places!"}
