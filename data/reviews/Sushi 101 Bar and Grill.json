{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi place to go to. Happy hour every day. And not so bad hours. I love the food. Staff is very good. And it's really clean. Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"My order was on a Sunday so adjust your opinion accordingly.  I have made the order over the phone. When i stepped in to grab the order,  the restaurant stunk. To be fair, the order was ready and the employees were nice.  However, when i got home, the four different rolls i tasted were bad. Again, the same stinky smell followed me home through the order. The rice was old and tasteless. I urge you to taste this place well before you have a party if you are going to use their services. Even the California roll I ordered was really bad. I never thought anyone could make that one bad.  I hope it was this bad because it was on a Sunday because i am typically a happy reviewer."}
{"text":"When I first saw the sign for Sushi101, I was skeptical.  I thought, \"this is WAY too close to ASU to be anything good.  With a name like Sushi 101, there is no way this is going to be legit\".  Bottom line, I was wrong.  They pretty much always have happy hour and it's really really good.  While I have not tried all of their specialty rolls, I especially love their Vegas roll and their Red Dragon roll as well.  The only thing I don't really like is that the service can get really slow for no reason.  I was in there about 2 weeks ago and it took FOREVER to get our last roll.  Our server brought over a Vegas roll (which we hadn't ordered that time) twice and kept forgetting that we hadn't ordered it.  While we weren't in a hurry, it was just a little frustrating to have to wait about 15 minutes for one roll.  Overall, I definitely like this place a lot; I just can't say I would go there if I was in a hurry to get some good sushi then go.  For the happy hour prices and location, definitely worth it if you live down in Tempe and want to get some respectable sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is the only place in the area I will go for sushi. They have great rolls, but I can't speak much for their other food. Service can sometimes be slow, but I'm never in a hurry so it doesn't bother me.   The Palm Spring roll is one of the best!   Worth a try if you've never been, you probably won't go anywhere else after visiting!"}
{"text":"Been going there for years....the rolls are good, sake awesome! My favorite is the Las Vegas Roll little bit of spice!  Although good and one of my favorite sushi places, different cooks maybe...its not always consistent so your favorite dish can be a little different each time. Tip:  the Happy Hour is really good almost 1/2 the bill!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a Zero star if possible.  The service was horrendous and when we complained to the manager on duty, the manager decided to argue  with us instead of addressing the issues.  The manager was more unprofessional than the server named Denise.  I am a business professional and have visited this establishment several times before and was happy with the food and service, but tonight the service was so bad that I immediately had to write this review.  They have lost a customer with me.  I would never visit this place again, and I hope the owners of this place read this and address the unprofessionalism that the staff is displaying to loyal customers."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and my last the manager was extremely nice, very attentive and so helpful but our waitress Liz was not she kept passing us to help a table of all guys and never came to ask us how things were until after the manager removed our plates and asked if we wanted dessert and to top it off after she gave us our check she kept coming back over and over again ... I have never been rushed to pay a check she was at our table more times to see if we were ready to pay then to ask us how things were and if we needed nothing else. The food was great and again the manager was awesome but the waitress Liz made it an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience this will definitely not be a regular Tuesday happy hour place with the bestie"}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi restaurant in town. I have been there 3 times, to be fair and give it a chance to change my mind. Each time the sushi has been dull, flavorless, and completely over priced. The service is so-so, and the menu would be impressive it the sushi had any quality to it at all. I have eaten many types of  good sushi and have never been so disappointed by the quality of food. For $14.00 I expect far more than some stale crab, limp rice, and over salted dipping sauce. Unfortunately, there are far better sushi places in town, such as Stingray and Kobe Tepan. Don't waste your time or money on Sushi 101"}
{"text":"By far our go to sushi spot! Been going here for years!! Reasonably priced and you get what you pay for. Not to mention the desert they gave me for my Birthday was the cutest thing!! It was amazing!! Almost forgot the service is always great!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch, it's great for a nice sit-down meal that's way better and probably much healthier than McDonalds or something. The bento boxes for lunch are an amazing deal, big meal for little prices and the servers are always really friendly (the guy with the Boston accent is my fav). Great place to stop."}
{"text":"They have the best selection for Vegetarian Rolls I have ever seen, They are creative and unbelievably delicious! I just added Cream Cheese to the Sweet Potato roll.. and it was sooo yummy! They should think about putting that on the menu. Also they were SUPER friendly & quick to help me since I only had 1/2 hour to eat and get to Chandler. I didn't even have to tell them that... they were just very attentive without being pushy. I would recommend this place over Sting Ray & RA in Scottsdale. The only drawback is their location. They should have either more locations... One in old town or in North Scottsdale would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious miso soup, salmon sushi, vegas rolls, and love boats!  Love the servers, they are very attentive. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here on Monday nights for some sake bombs and a golden state roll. Since they took away the sake bomb special on Monday nights, all that's left is one good roll and inferior service.  I just had to get up and get my own soy sauce and dish.  One saving grace is that they play good music.   Just pray a drunken driver doesn't crash into the patio."}
{"text":"Gotta be the most affordable sushi happy hour prices in all of Phoenix. Really great sushi, really great service!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm.... highly recommended.  Sushi is on average about 30% off and I ordered 3 main courses, plus 2 appetizers. It was delicious, and I was absolutely stuffed- obviously. Ate it all, California Rolls, Shrimp Tempura, Spring rolls, etc...Service was alright, kind of had to give her the wave whenever something was needed. Her friends were sitting at the table next to us as we heard their entire conversation pretty well. They chatted and chatted, and chatted. The price was perfect, but it was happy hour, otherwise it is quite expensive."}
{"text":"This place is nasty! I had heard bad things about Sushi 101, but got roped into coming here by a friend.  We were both very disappointed.  The fish was a weird color and smelled bad.  When we told the manager about it, he brushed it off and walked away.  Terrible service, disgusting food.  It's cheap but you get what you pay for here..."}
{"text":"Ehh, it's alright. Only go there during the happy hours. I especially love the reseverse happy hour. Otherwise I'd say it's overpriced for the quality. The service varies, sometimes excellent other times meh :("}
{"text":"This place is good! I usually come during happy hour, so it is pretty busy but I've never had too long of a wait.  My favorite is their spicy tuna roll. I've had their gyoza and seaweed salad before, but would not recommend them. The gyoza especially was not that great. Even though it's happy hour the pricing is more than other sushi places I've been to for happy hour.  It's right by ASU, so they're very used to dealing with groups coming in and ordering. I've never had them mess up or forget some order in the big groups I've gone in with. Keep in mind they don't seat unless at least half of your group is there, so be careful if you have flaky friends or if you are they flaky friend.  My biggest negative is that sometimes it just feels a bit too dark and loud. It's not a very good place for a one on one date or conversation."}
{"text":"Service piss poor, food middling. Waited 45 minutes for food to be served, on a quiet afternoon. Party of one, but they added 18% gratuity without consultation. Dingy atmosphere, not appetizing when you're ordering raw fish. Whoever prepares their fake salmon needs to revise their recipe (Oh, that's supposed to be real salmon? Not a chance in hell)--they've clearly never tasted the real thing. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I loved the food and how quick the service was! Service was nice too very attentive! Only complaint is that the roles where a bit on the small side but tasted awesome!"}
{"text":"Not bad!   So far the only sushi I've tried here is the Diamondback roll - which is good but not amazing.  It says on the menu it comes with a ponzu sauce but that never seems to be with it.  They smashed the wasabi and ginger together in a little sauce cup, which might not bother anyone else but I hate ginger so I don't like it anywhere near my wasabi or sushi...  I like the crab puffs, parts seemed over done and parts seemed under done so it seems like they didn't turn it / pay attention while they were cooking, but otherwise they're good.  The veggie tempura is okay - I'm used to fluffier/flakier tempura and better tasting sauce... but it's not bad.  (I can't comment on the atmosphere or location as I get food from Sushi 101 by delivery.)  Also, they did a good job of following my special instructions, which in my experience is rare.  That alone gave them an extra star."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 has the best sushi happy hour! I used to always go to Sushi 101 when I lived in Tempe. I live in San Diego now, and I also stop by when I visit my family. The sushi is delicious and the drinks are pretty inexpensive as well. The location is perfect, right by ASU campus. The prices are unbeatable especially comparing them to California prices. I would recommend Sushi 101 to anyone!"}
{"text":"Do not get the buckwheat noodles here.  So not authentic and a lot of the stuff doesn't taste good. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Since they fired all of Japan chief. It is totally Amaricalized and not authentic at all. They always forget to give card back. The waiter are wordy and do everything as slow as possible. The restroom has no paint."}
{"text":"I had a great time here with friends.. Had a little bit of everything. Big fan of the Black and Yellow and Chicken Katsu. Tried the Crunch Lollipop too, it was a little too sweet for my taste buds.  Fantastic service and laid back environment."}
{"text":"Very good sushi! The Vegas roll and golden state roll were the best!  I would recommend this place, just be careful what sushi you order because a few roles come with only 5 pieces and are sorta expensive. Oh and if you want a tasty spicy roll get the Tiger's Eye Roll. I could keep naming rolls but you get the idea!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. Tasty sushi. And Chelsea (bartender) was VERY pleasant and accommodating. :-)"}
{"text":"great guys at the sushi bar, I have been there for years! Its a great place for happy hour with the $5 sake bombs. I recently moved back to the bay area and went to visit and they still knew me and made me feel like I was family when I came back! If Garrison is there sit and have a chat with him at the sushi bar he is great and loves to chat with the customers!"}
{"text":"Previous reviews make me think people must have really high expectations as far as price for quality sushi. I've been here twice and think the prices are great. They are equal to what I've paid at most places before, unless I was going out to a fancier place. Both times I've been there, I've had great servers. However, don't be surprised if you get an expensive bill after getting a few drinks. Their cocktails don't have happy hour prices, but their sake bombs are only $5.50 during happy hour. For that price, you get enough beer and sake for about 3 \"bombs\", which is a great deal. Sure, it's not the greatest sushi I've ever had, but I'm from Oregon where places can get significantly fresher fish, for obvious reasons.  Of all the rolls I tried, none of them were bad, but some were better than others. If you want a casual place to go on a date, with friends, or in a large group, I highly recommend Sushi 101. Definitely go during happy hour (4-7 and 9-close)...most of their basic rolls are only $3.50. Unfortunately, specialty rolls are still on the expensive side ($8.50-$12), but that's still a pretty good deal for a sit-down place and not crappy \"conveyer belt\" sushi places."}
{"text":"Affordable sushi and cool atmosphere. Fish is a little fishy, so I can't attest to the quality, but it hits the spot, especially when you're craving! My friend and I love getting the \"Love Boat\", a dinner made for two."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here twice. The first time, my husband was very pleased with his plate of albacore. Each piece was thick and tasty.   Last night we gave this restaurant a second try and was not thrilled. I ordered chicken teriyaki for $8 and could not eat it. The chicken was so dry and the food was cold when it came out. To be honest, I thought the chicken was precooked and reheated/sauced to order. The rice was hard and dry as well. My husband order a plate of albacore again. The pieces were much thinner than last but he said it tasted good. He mentioned that kabuki restaurant definitely gives more for the money than sushi 101. I don't think we will be coming back.   As for service, it was ok. Nothing special."}
{"text":"To sum things up: just okay. They have a good happy happy hour: good drink prices and pretty good sushi prices. The food is okay. I've only had one really bad item there (sushi with rice so undercooked it was crunchy). Most of the time things are pretty good to adequate. It's still a good place to meet for happy hour but hardly a destination worth a long drive."}
{"text":"i love this place for it's happy sushi prices and delicious sushi. i wouldn't recommend going during not happy hour priced times because the sushi can get a bit pricy. there is a giant parking lot, so no worries there. however, the service is very hit or miss. sometimes, you'll have an extremely attentive server... but other times, you'll see them maybe 3 times the entire time you're there, and it takes about 20 minutes to get your sushi rolls and it's not busy. however, the sushi is delicious... so maybe it balances out?"}
{"text":"So I have never had a Yelp account until this past week i set myself up with one just so I can write how terrible my last experience was at sushi 101 I used to like this place I was in there bout three times out of the month and now it's all ruined.   First off there was only one sever on knowing that happy hour was in a half hour so it took bout 20 minutes to take our drink order we ordered food cause if it took that long to get our drink order then better not risk it.  So we finally got our two rolls to hold us up till happy hour after 15 min happy hour rolled around and we ordered two more rolls so we kept waiting for 35 min the manager comes out and says \"sorry bout the wait your order must of not got rung in but it's getting g made and we will buy you dessert\"so I was no worries sounds good to me.which I thought finally we get our two rolls we ordered and a quail shooter the waitress said \"I think the cooks are mad cause they had to make the order\"so with that being said I tell you with a honesty and truth that one of the rolls was wrong and one had a hair in it thankful that it was visible cause if I would of ate it I would of threw it up  We got the sever she got the same manager on duty that spoke to us about the dessert he came to our table I showed him the hair and note that I have a shaved head he looked at me like I was crazy he said \"I'm sorry I can remake it for you and take care of your dessert\"I looked at him like are your serious would you want to eat anything after you found a hair no I don't want anything to eat so he took off the two rolls and tried to charge me for the quail shooter that I did not eat I don't ask for anything I just don't come back but on this situation I thought maybe he would comp the bill but he looked at me like I was in the wrong and may I mention I was in the food and beverage for more the twelve years from busser,host,sever all the way to kitchen manager so I know great service I would not feed you anything I wouldn't myself or family and friends I didn't even want to give sushi 101 even 1 star i just won't ever go back out all places I have eaten this was the worse experience ever I made it a goal to myself to write this review even tho I never complain I just had to on this that's how bad   Sushi 101 did me so thank you for losing me a customer I used to be fond of this place and the manager there needs to work on customer service or ya just don't care"}
{"text":"So yummy!! They have happy hour 4-7 every day and again from 9- close. My boyfriend and I happened to come in at 5pm so we got to enjoy the discounts! We had gyoza and 4 different sushi rolls and they were all AMAZING. Service was great. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for a restaurant. Showed up with a party of 8 and they basically refused to seat us. Employees were a joke. Even when other customers stated we were first they said \"they're fine\" never recommending this place or ever going back. They don't want your money."}
{"text":"Super salty miso soup with a few tofu cubes and zero seaweed, very thin rolls. We got a few rolls to go with miso soup. The order included a tiny amount of ginger and wasabi in a cellophane wrap and about a tablespoon of soy sauce. Super unimpressed."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting at a table at Sushi 101 after waiting 40 minutes to even get seated. While I know the food is more than desirable, the service is utterly chaotic. When first walking in, there were crowds of people with drinks and it was difficult to even find a hostess. When finally reaching one, I put our name in for a table of three. She approximates a 30 minute wait which would have allowed us to receive the Happy Hour discount which ends at 7:00 pm. When we finally got seated at 7:02 the table wasn't even set up. We waited another 2 minutes for a third chair and another 10 minutes before a waitress even came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders. And 7 minutes later we got our drinks. I understand that I shouldn't base judgement on the waitress due to the crowds, however when we finally put in our food order we were told the sushi was going to take about 30-45 minutes before even coming out. I guess I'll post another review when we get our food."}
{"text":"Overall amazing experience! Came in and sat down feeling very welcome. Colton the bar tender killed it. Great guy, great conversation, great suggestion, great service. Sake bombs were 3.75 which was a gamechanger and awesome!!! Always have a great time here and would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Went there at happy hour; the restaurant was moderately busy. Took about 15 mins to get our sushi. The sushi was of solid, workmanlike quality. Nothing spectacular but not bad. Friendly service and cheap drinks. A decent place for sushi if you have to stay near campus"}
{"text":"This place should never get a bad rap.   Happy hour 4-7 and then 9-close is ridiculous.  Most of the rolls will be in the $4-6 range with the specials around $8.  The quality is excellent and sake bombs are $5.  Service is the only complaint, the turnover rate at this place is crazy.  I see 5 new faces every time I go in there."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food but the last time I was there we were treated AWFUL by the \"manager\" himself. It was some younger guy with a pony tail. We ordered several items, one of the sushi rolls literally came out when we were just about done with dinner. Before they brought it out to us, we told the waitress we were going to go ahead and cancel that order since we were done eating at that point. She said okay no problem, then the manager came back and told us we could take the roll or leave it but we were still going to pay for it since they had already made it and they couldn't \"re-sell it because we had ordered it without cucumber so it was a custom order\".   When my husband told him we refused to pay for it since it was over 30 minutes since the rest of our food had been served, the manager had the audacity to threaten to call the police if we didn't pay for it. I think this was rude, unprofessional, and completely unnecessary since my husband and I were NOT yelling or being rude or aggressive in any way. We ended up paying the tab out of embarrassment for the back and forth but we will never be back there again. I don't think one roll of sushi is a good reason to lose or threaten a customer ....not to mention the fact that the manager's biggest disappointment was the fact that they wouldn't be able to \"RE-SELL\" the item. Now I wonder how many times they served us somebody else's order that they didn't eat :( GROSS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Service fast & efficient. And the salmon sushi just melts in your mouth"}
{"text":"This place has the worst atmosphere on the planet, it is neither romantic nor relaxed. The could use music, better lighting, and better service. All together I give this place a 2 because the only thing that made the experience somewhat worthwhile was the fact that so many people were there and so it made it easy to start a conversation. My server and food came cold and the drinks although cheap took forever to get."}
{"text":"I have been a server for about 5 years.. Garrison the MOD, made mine and my girl friends dinner exceptional. I have never written a review before but I feel like people should know about his restaurants customer service,  and excellent sushi. Managers I have worked with do not usually go out of their way like he did for us. Great customer service always makes the food taste better. The food was phenomenal. I was a little skeptical being from la county eating sushi in Arizona but it was amazing. I would highly recommend this place. Our manager, greeted us at the door and had a great attitude. Give him a raise! More restaurants should model his service!!! Thanks garrison!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is always good, and the sushi is really tasty! I hardly ever leave a piece behind :)"}
{"text":"I like this place, I would give it 3.5 stars, can't give it 4 so I had to pick 3. The service is good, every one is polite and usually have a smile on their faces. I like the people that work there.  Some of their food is great and some as not worth what you pay for but most of their menu items are good.  I definitely  LOVE their spring rolls and I think it's a MUST to try, the accompanying  sauce is just amazing.  I like most of their rolls except for the new spicy octopus (dunno why they changed the way the used to make them!!) but I don't think they're only worth more than the happy-price due to the size and the use of imitation crab.  I'm not a big fan of their yakitoris as it always came dry and had that taste that made me thing it was pre-cooked.  Bottom-line, will I go there again? YES."}
{"text":"Sake bombs, sake bombs, sake bombs!  This place has a killer happy hour. A 2 bucks for edamame. 5 bucks for sake bomber with a huge beer and a seemingly never ending container of sake (not actually never ending).   And I haven't even mentioned the Sushi. The happy hour makes a lot of the rolls really affordable (3$ California roll) and the quality and taste is decent. They do tend to take a while and they will bring out whatever is ready first so it may be a few minutes for your friend to get theirs but that just means you have more time to chat and drink sake.   Saying all this I don't know if I would come here when it's not happy hour but the good news is they have happy hour and reverse happy hour so almost every time you go you will be there at the right time.  Had numerous early nights out with my friends here at happy hour and always had a good time. Would recommend it for any group of friends or couples that want to drink, chat and have a good time."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about sushi so close to ASU but this place was great. We had a few orders of nigiri and some rolls as well as the stuffed jalapeños and some tempura shrimp. Service was great and we squeaked in right before the end of happy hour which was great. Mochi for dessert was the perfect end. We will be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful sushi boat! We were here with six people and upon request they served it on a sushi boat! It was beautiful AND delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin. Edamame is way oversalted. No draft beer. No sapporo beer? Come on! Happy hour price is $1 off? If you're going to do a happy hour. Do a good one or dont bother to do one at all. Sushi is mediocre. Freshness is mediocre."}
{"text":"Their Spider roll, ASU roll, and Monkey brain roll were to DIE for! Its right by ASU! Why haven't I stopped by here before!!!??"}
{"text":"Go for the Heart Attack and the Gayoza Pot Stickers.  Love the place.  Pricing is fair, sushi is good (both raw and imitation) and most importantly, the place is clean.  Great vibe all around."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time, and it was just ok. It took the waitress a little bit to finally come over and get our order, but she was friendly. I had gone with my boyfriend, who is not a fan of sushi but went just to please me. We had seriously JUST missed happy hour, 20 minutes before we had gotten there, which sucks but it was still easy on the wallet. We got the Philly roll, Golden Gate roll, and the Spider roll. The Golden gate roll was GOOD! I would definitely recommend that. The Spider roll, not so much.. it was falling apart and seemed really dry. The philly roll was ok, you could taste mostly the cream cheese only. I am not sure if I would go here again, unless it was for happy hour. Oh yes, and we both had gotten dessert, which was sooo good! I tried the Banana tempura (amazing oh my god!!) and my boyfriend got the New York Cheesecake which was good from the one bite I had taken from it. But this place is definitely worth a try during happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is awesome and the food is great. It is a good way to enjoy sushi weekly without going broke. I have been to a bunch of other sushi restaurants in the area and I found the food at Sushi 101 to be by far the best. The atmosphere is very inviting and even on a Friday night when it is packed with drunk kids, it is still an awesome place to be."}
{"text":"We had excellent food and service! The staff worked as a team to keep drinks full, service fast, and even came to find us in the parking lot when we left my daughter's jacket. The place was packed and we were in and out in 45 minutes."}
{"text":"They don't deserve customers I got there at 10:30 pm on 9/9/2013 the lady on the cashier didn't take my order she told me that they are closed I tried to call them four times before getting their they even pick up my phone call .  SHAME ON THEM"}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is a great place to go grab a bite for anybody! I am vegan and they accommodated me very well!! I even asked for a Dragon Roll to go and she was kind enough to not only put the complimentary sauces in take-away containers, but she also separated the Dragon Roll (which has salmon) from the vegan food. We followed her recommendations and they were delish! Will come again soon."}
{"text":"This was the last place on earth I expected to have the best sushi experience of my life, but it happened. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it's not something everyone's gonna be able to duplicate.  See, I like sushi without crap. No avocado, no cream cheese, no mayonnaise-based BS sauce. I like raw fish, vegetables, and the occasional citrus. I'm not going to Ra for a reason, basically. When I explained all of this to the waiter (who was hobbling around like James Caan in Misery), he told me to order the Heaven on Earth roll. I did it, sans avocado, and found a new favorite, instantly. They were also very amenable to my request for slivered onions soaked in ponzu sauce as a topping for my salmon nigiri. If you haven't tried that, btw, then do it. If you're allergic to salmon, then you did some bad shit in a past life.  The squid salad seemed a little off. I don't know what it is about it, but I've definitely had better, and it's not something I think I'll be ordering again here.  The Island Poki is delicious, but comes served as a salad with leaves, so I always feel bad about the waste if I'm by myself, and giving it to a date results in mixed results. Poki and lettuce shouldn't be mixed, I think.  The prices are reasonable (for sushi in AZ), about $35 w/tip to a pretty waitress (yes, that makes a difference) for Salmon Nigiri, HoE roll and a hand roll of spicy tuna with hot tea.  I've been for the oft-praised happy hour here, and while the price is good, the sushi is unremarkable.  All in all, this place has done me right, and I know I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Their happy hour prices are very hard to beat. Perfect location next to ASU. Not to mention the sushi quality here is good. Not many places in Arizona can too 101's sushi I highly recommend this place for people who are 1) looking for good sushi, 2) looking for a good happy hour, 3) looking for great prices especially college students."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for a few years now. Just about everything has a happy hr. price and the sushi is good. The music ambiance is good and not overly loud, like Ra, where I can't hear myself think. Great spot for sushi once or twice a week.  I like Monkey Brain roll, Roll 101, Alaskan roll, Spider roll, Spicy Salmon Hand roll and Seafood Dynamite & Baked Mussels appetizers. I like to try the daily special roll if it piques my interest."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place on and off for the last 4 years and these last few times have made me never want to go again. Lately their seafood tastes really old and it tastes really really fishy in a bad way. Do not order the salmon dynamite!!! My fiance and I got sick to our stomachs and it really tasted off to begin with. Overall, their seafood tastes old and fishy. I like their crunch lollipop and vegas roll, but it's not worth going back. There are better places. This is just another place for college kids to go to who don't have cars."}
{"text":"Customer service here is awesome, my waitress was very friendly. Other than that, everything is just okay. Food here is not even better than average RA. I had sashimi, rolls and sushi. None of them impressed me. I'd rather go to Kabuki or RA. I'd give it 3 stars for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"After horrible service, got automatically added gratuity for a group of 5. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The sushi here was really good!! I came here for reverse happy hour and the deals aren't really that good. My tab was still pretty high and I was surprised, but only some rolls are like $1 to $2 off. It's not a smoking deal, but if you're okay with spending $12 to $15 a roll then here is your place! I got the Godzilla with jalapeño on top and it was absolutely delicious!!!! I also had a mojito and Gyoza, which were both really good. We came here after a graduation at ASU and our server was very nice and took care of our party!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour...Great food & even better pricing!  our server was Illianna and she was so friendly & attentive. Will definitely keep coming here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi!!!  So many varieties and I keep coming back for more. So far my favorite rolls are the ASU and Grizzly Bear rolls. The grizzly has a spicy kick at the end of eating a piece. Splendid!!  Not too much spice either as I'm not a big spice person. ASU is just amazing as there really are no words for how good it is!!!  Tried the Q Maki which was refreshing. The monsoon and sun devil roll are good too. I will definitely be back as I want to try their whole sushi menu as they have a great variety!!  This will be my new go to sushi place. The manager Garrison is super nice, hospitable and friendly. Sometimes the wait staff is a bit slow to come to your table, but the sushi is worth coming back for minus the lag time in the servers. Melt in your mouth sushi!  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I hope it stays around for a long time!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 4 years now. Never disappoints. The Salmon Dynamite and Albacore nigiri are truly the greatest. Quality of fish is excellent... Better spicy tuna than Stingray an RA. Rad place.  Grade: A  Thanks y'all."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Is that long enough? Okay not enough text for Yelp. One darned good sushi bar"}
{"text":"My husband and i have been going here for nearly a decade! The food is great for the (happy hour) price! The service is usually really good, with friendly staff and promptly served food. They have the best crab puffs i've ever tasted and lots of vegetarian options! Oddly though, i get a tummy ache 40 percent of the time i eat at Sushi 101, but it's not bad enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"I have had great and amazing sushi, where I wanted to weep silently and kowtow to whatever created the amazing sensation in my mouth.  Just not in AZ.  However, in AZ, there are definitely tiers of Sushi restaurants, for simplicity sake, tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 (1 is the best).  Sushi 101 firmly lodges itself in tier 2.  The actual fish itself is just \"meh\" but the happy hour specials keep me coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed this time here.  It's been awhile I haven't been here. Sushi rolls were meh... I ordered Shrimp Tempura they arrived soggy. Drinks were water down. I spent about $60.00 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is always delicious and the staff is wonderful. Great variety of sushi and other entrees. Only downside is for take-out I was quoted 20-25min and it took 30+"}
{"text":"Came on a monday night during happy hour, never had such terrible service at a restaurant. Our waitress brought us waters once and never refilled them, she put in the wrong orders for two of our six person party, charged me EXTRA on my bill after giving me the wrong food, and never offered to bring me another beer after forgetting to put it in the first time. Unreal how terrible the service was, the waitress had a shaved half side of her head. She also added 20% gratuity for our party after giving such terrible service. Will never come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I have always gone during happy hour, and the prices are amazing. The sushi is ok nothing great about it..the rice can be a little mushy :/ Also the service sucks, our server was no whee to be seen when we needed refils, chopsticks, to go boxes. nothing. I did however like the pomegranatini they have oh my it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty middle of the road. The ingredients seemed to be fresh but there didn't really seem to be a lot of diversity in their specialty rolls. The service wasn't bad. Our waitress was friendly but had to be reminded after forgetting our drink for about 10 minutes. The crispy spring rolls were great though. I'd give a better rating if they would have used a bit more skill in the preparation. Deep fried roll had a horribly think breading and all the rolls were cut super thick."}
{"text":"These douche bags made us pay our bill TWICE on Sat. night!!!!!!!!  We left $60 on our bill on the front COUNTER in front of the MANAGER & they came up to us after we left & were waiting to cross the street out front, saying we hadn't paid our bill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Complete douche bags, awful experience & obviously we will never be going back!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can not believe we paid over $100 for a few rolls, some undercooked edamame & \"gyoza\" that was just frozen potstickers!"}
{"text":"5 Stars- Seriously, FIVE STARS FOR THE SWEET POTATO ROLL!!!!!!!!!  Now, it's probably not a traditional roll, but man is it tasty!  5 Stars- Happy Hour prices are seriously out of this world - 15 dollar TOTAL for 2 people with drinks, edamame, and 3 rolls!!!  3 Stars- I'm sorry, this was SLOOOOOWWWW, for service  = 4.5 Stars! Not quite \"as good as it gets\", but pretty darn close. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant cimung in here because it was empty. I planned on going to a different retaurant, but it was packed. I am so happy i ended up here. The sushi is very good and you have to try the spicy edamame- they are delicious. Do not pass this place up. Stop in. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great time at sushi101. Leant how to make Sushi rolls. Awesome fun highly recommend as fun Sunday. Thanks"}
{"text":"just got here the server brought water and beer and then disappeared for 10 min and I don't even know when she is coming back ! Wow terrible place here!"}
{"text":"Food was great and their happy  hour is fantastic. Lots of options for those who are allergic to shellfish. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We live a mile away from Sushi 101, but never had the urge to try. We tried the Poke bowl and white fish plate and they are terrific. The price is decent and the service is wonderful too. We definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by telling you that I am not a very big sushi fan, but after going to Sushi 101, they definitely changed my mind!  I went with 2 friends during their happy hour and we each got our own appetizer as well as our own roll.  It did come out at all different times, but it was great!  The waiter was super patient with my little knowledge of sushi and also very helpful in selecting a roll he believed I would like.  I would highly recommend this sushi place if you're looking for a cheap place to go for a fun night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, recommend. Parking can be a pain during rush hour because it's so close to ASU."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have a killer Happy hour, amazing rolls and the Bartender Liza is the BEST, she is so sweet and helpful!! My only complaint is the hostess is pretty rude... other than that I cant wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place! good happy hour and great sushi always sounds like a good idea to me!! Try the Sun Devil role   They also have reverse happy hour on sushi and drinks as well"}
{"text":"Great place to get some rolls and saki for a moderate price. The service was great and everyone I encountered in the restaurant was nice and pleasant. The rolls were decent and we were able to order a good amount off of the happy hour menu. I would honestly prefer coming here instead of RA."}
{"text":"I always end up here after 9pm for their happy hour and get sushi. The sushi is good tasting but the rolls never stay together, the ten plus times I have been here I end up eating my rolls like a rice bowl instead of like real sushi because they fall apart."}
{"text":"Best Feature: Asahi beer and edamame  Ahh the subject of many a drunken joke \"let's take that Sushi 101 class together.\"  Actually, as a recent graduate I already miss this place.  It was a great local jaunt to grab a few Japanese beers between classes.  Otherwise you'd have to go to [shudder] Ra.  The staff was pretty friendly and the cooks seemed legitimate (Although all I had was beer and edamame).  Ah...I miss izakayas...."}
{"text":"Really how is this place not a 5 star!?!Best sushi in town hands down. Fast service ,friendly staff. Personal favorite golden state, getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi bars. Had a friend who introduced me and now I've taken over 5 people to eat here. Their sushi is a little cheaper than most places but the quality is still great. This is the place where I tried garlic edamame for the first time as well as dared to have a quail egg slide down my throat. Their sushi hour is incredible. I've had to settle with other place's lack of items compared to Sushi 101's variety during happy hour. It's my first choice when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"I seem to be having a very different experience than a lot of people. I have enjoyed the sushi, the cost is low, and the service has always been pretty prompt.   Overall, after going here semi-regularly since they have opened, I have found it better than many of the more trendy places in the valley. By no means the best in the world, but pretty solid."}
{"text":"We were traveling through town and met our nephew here for lunch.  I think he kind of randomly picked a place near the university.  His selection is proof that college kids will eat anything, especially if someone else is paying for it.  I will say that service was friendly and prompt.  However, the food is mediocre.  The rolls, for example, were completely flavorless.    The bento box that our nephew selected had a plentiful supply of food.  It, too, was rather tasteless, however.     There are several restaurants in the area, so perhaps you might try something else.   Also, this is a very travel congested area, and parking is a real challenge if you are driving, as we were."}
{"text":"Yum. Fan of Sushi 101, especially since it is right down the street form where I live. BEWARE of the Blue Ocean (cocktail)."}
{"text":"Read this carefully: They have a POLICY to STEAL your MONEY.  Mangers are telling waitstaff to \"round checks up\" - so when you get your bill of $8.65 and give them a $20, you will get back $11 and no change.   Sure a disappearing $ .45 doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is when it is your money. Then the waiter tells you that his boss told him, and other waitstaff told him that's \"the way it's done.\"   This happened to me not 20 minutes ago.  Stealing.  Policy.  Illegal.  (never mind the mediocre food....)"}
{"text":"MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!!!!! If I want to go deaf while eating sushi, I can go to Ra.  This new policy at 101 is a disappointment.  But the Happy Hour is the best deal in town and 98% of the staff is incredibly courteous and sincere.   So the management gets an A+ for hiring and training  . . . and a D- for letting the same (very young) staff run the stereo!!!  Sorry, just annoyed that my ears are still ringing.  (not kidding)"}
{"text":"This place is one of my absolute favorites. When I think of sushi, I think of Sushi 101. They have awesome miso soup and a kick-ass ginger salad. Happy hour here is awesome! It makes a yummy, unique dining experience so affordable. Honestly, I don't think I've tasted better sushi than at this place.   The environment is so relaxing and you get food and entertainment if you sit at the sushi bar. They'll make most of the rolls right in front of you. I've always found watching the food made to be absolutely fascinating. It only serves to make me want it more. I go here a great deal with my husband and it always makes for a great date night. The staff are friendly, helpful and just in general really cool.   I've never had a bad experience here and would go everyday if my budget allowed it. It can be a bit pricey outside of happy hour, but if you can make it between 4 and 7, it's well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Awesome place to come hangout for happy hour with some buddies. Oh! And server, Dani was excellent!"}
{"text":"We always get great food and service here!  And I love how Yumi remembers us each time we come in. We had our first date here in 2007 and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered Cali Crunch rolls for Delivery from GrubHub. Those were not what I got an when I called to inform them my order was wrong the women insisted she looked an there was a \"slight crunch\". Teriyaki is good an these rolls weren't bad. Just basically was called a liar. 1st & last time eating from here."}
{"text":"The name suits the restaurant! The food is not terrible, but clearly could be better. Expect your rolls to fall apart and not to have much flavor. They have plenty of vegetarian options, however they don't have much taste. Service is correct if you are pretty patient"}
{"text":"This is more a remedial course in Sushi, rather than Sushi 101.  After visiting Sushi 101 three or four times, I have decided to never return.  It is not that this is a terrible restaurant, it is not, but considering the large number of other sushi restaurants in the area, there is no reason to go back.  Basic problems: 1) Service: It has always been slow and disorganized (i.e. getting seated and not being approached by a server for 15 minutes, always shorthanded) 2) Uninspired food: bland and not especially fresh in taste (their wasabi has little-to-no-kick)  3) Ambience and Smell:  I know that this might seem petty, but there is nothing worse than eating in a place that specializes in preparing fish, and all you can smell is old fish."}
{"text":"Literally the worst sushi I've had. Worse than supermarket sushi. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 was a favorite of mine but it has become completely overpriced! Their sushi happy hour special are just a $1 off. Like really? I was shocked when I saw this because I do not remember it being like that.   Most of their worthy rolls are $10-$12 DURING happy hour!  Let's just do the math for this. You buy a roll that's $11 that contains 8 pieces of sushi, that's about $1.37 per piece! And for this price it's definitely not worth it since it's not like it tastes amazing or anything.   Next time I'm at ASU and I'm craving sushi, I'll just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Honestly a thumbs down on service, pricing and a thumbs way WAY down on food! Even the miso soup tasted like dirty salt water. I can only imagine they are solely surviving off being located by asu and serving booze because the sushi was a full blown FAIL!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a freshman at ASU and it's always been a great place to grab cheap sushi with a group of friends. The rice is usually pretty dry, but the seafood is pretty fresh - in this instance, I think the appropriate phrase is 'you get what you pay for'. The proximity to ASU gives it a very lively, college atmosphere and the wait staff is very welcoming and helpful. Like I said, not a preeminent sushi spot but a good place to chill with friends."}
{"text":"Okay sushi not worth it for regular price maybe for happy hour.  But the service was terrible.  They had the bartender serving us when she had a full bar and the manager was just sitting down eating dinner.  We wanted to order more but didnt' watn to wait another 20 minutes to get a roll.  I paid with cash so I could leave earlier because i waited 10 minutes for the check to get picked up."}
{"text":"Its good sushi, the waitress is funny because she speaks Happy-Fast-Engligh-As-A-Second-Language. We go there about once every week or two"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place really close to ASU in the heart of Tempe! Prices are little high but they have a solid happy hour where a lot of rolls and appetizers are discounted. They also have drink specials depending on the day of the week. I went on a Monday and they were offering $4.50 sake bombs! Came with about three shots of sake and a huge beer... really good deal!   I got the Godzilla roll and it was spicy and delicious! Would like to come back and try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Love sushi 101! Been going here since 2004. Great food and new specials weekly. All the managers are great. Try the spring rolls or yakisoba if your not wanting sushi. Otherwise the 101 and Palm Springs rolls are my favorite. Love their iced green tea too."}
{"text":"A couple friends and i came here to pregame and grub before going out. Best idea ever!!! The happy hour was insanely cheap, 1.50 budlight draft, 5.50 sakebombers?! they even have a reverse happy hour starting at 9! The sushi took a bit long to come out but its understandable since it was SO packed in there!"}
{"text":"First time here. The sushi chiefs seem knowledgable. They do not have escolar. But every thing I ordered was delish."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to have sushi for dinner to celebrate my birthday. We had actually found another place, through Yelp, but wound up here due to wonky GPS directions. But I'm not disappointed that we ended up here!   We sat at the bar and we didn't even know we had gotten there at the last 15 minuets of happy hour. The bartender let us know, got us menus right away, and checked back quickly to get our order so that we could take advantage of the happy hour. She was great! Happy hour prices are a couple to three dollars off the original prices, but it was nice to take advantage!   The bar menu had a hard cider I enjoy and my boyfriend had a few to choose from that he liked.   We started with the pot stickers (Gyoza), they were good. The outside wasn't too crispy or overcooked and there were good. We also shared a spicy salmon roll, the 101 roll, the sakura roll, and the monkey brain. They were all very good! If we are back in town, we would come back. The prices were decent, the food was good, and the bartender we had was great!"}
{"text":"I've never had sushi delivered before, but I've been sick and it sounded delicious.  This is the best sushi! I can't wait to go to the restaurant and eat in! Yum!"}
{"text":"My fav sushi spot! Delicious and the staff is always great! It's affordable, and they have happy hour everyday! And reverse happy hour as well! Weekends included....they have always been super great about accommodating my gluten free needs."}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross. Just... no. The service was fantastic - I'll give my server that, just not the food. The miso tasted like it came from a dry mix (with dried-reconstituted tofu bits) and the edamame was microwaved. The nigiri was skimpy and they seemed to be out of a lot when we went."}
{"text":"I like going here during happy hour and scoring a good deal on some grub. I got the Dragon rolls and California rolls and they were delicious. Beer was priced fair also. Good atmosphere as it is a nice place. Check it out."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Sushi 101 was probably almost 6 years ago, so I dont remember the experience.  The second time I went to Sushi 101 I will not forget my unenjoyable service!  The waitress we had seemed exhausted and like she did not want to be there.  While we were rushing to get our order in before Happy Hour ended, she seemed overwhelmed.  We had already knew what we wanted, made the order clear and concise, but she seemed irritated to have to hurry.  The biggest issue my party and I had while there was that, after a problem wtih my order (she ordered the wrong roll), she ignored our table for the rest of the time we were there until my new order came out!  When I told her my order was not correct, she made it clear that she would have to pay for the mistake--I'm sorry it is coming out of your paycheck, but you made the mistake in the system!  She did not refill our drinks the entire time we were there, and made me feel as though the mistake was my fault.  All she could do was split the price of the roll that I had not wanted, which I dont understand why a restaurant would have that policy, instead of just clearing it from my tab.  I dont think I will return to Sushi 101!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I received dishes that had some pervious patron food still stuck on it. The food was sub par but the service received from Alicia was awful!! She needs to be fired or retrained be she obviously doesn't have a clue. As someone in the industry I'm pretty sure any owner would not want their place of business ran like this. God awful experience, would not recommend."}
{"text":"I had a huge order. Majority of the food was amazing. My issue was with the old, grayish salmon sashimi. I have NEVER been served sashimi with this appearance. It looked horrid. I contacted the restaurant to complain, and the manager told me to contact Grubhub about it. He didn't offer to fix it. Customer service is very important to me, and he failed to represent his company in such way. I won't be eating from there in the future."}
{"text":"The sushi was decent, not great, but definitely not worth the hour wait to have it brought after I placed my order. To make things worse, individual dishes were brought to our group with very long intervals in between, so some members of our group had finished eating long before others got what they ordered.  Happy hour prices (which were not all that low) were not much of a redeeming factor for the sorry experience of a meal I had here."}
{"text":"This is the McDonald's of Sushi... cheap, clean and efficient but pretty  blah food.   I can see people giving it a star higher for their happy hour deals, etc. but if talking about the quality of the main focus - the food - it's 2 star.   Tuna roll - overwhelming vinegar taste. Not sure if this was the fish or rice. It made me question the freshness.   Spicy scallops looked like cream corn and tasted like mayo + sriracha sauce. The rice and nori were bone dry - so much so that I separated them and only ate the scallop part.   Salmon skin rolls - The grilled skin should have been the star but got muddled with crab meat and other fillings in a very skinny roll.   And these were pretty basic selections - not the fancy rolls with 32 ingredients. That said, they weren't awful - but simply nothing memorable. It's similar to RA or Kona - an inviting space, good happy hour deals, etc. But if you want good fare, check out the higher rated places around town where the food is the star."}
{"text":"In Short: Average Sushi, not much imagination, but the happy hour is awesome.  I probably wouldn't go here on a regular basis if the happy hour isn't so good.  The location is pretty nice as well, conveniently located around the heart of tempe, and pretty close to ASU as well.  The interior is decorated \"asian\" style but it has some quirkiness to it as well.  There are two main areas to dine, one is by bar and the other is the main dining hall.  The staff is pretty nice too, mostly college kids.    It's your average sushi place, you got various types of maki, then a decent collection of nagiri, but not a lot of variation in sashimi.  I find most of the maki to have too much rice, and it's packed pretty hard, making it a bit too glutenous.  There are o specialty \"wow\" items on the menu, just the basics.  What makes this place decent is the happy hour.  Not every item is in it but it's pretty comprehensive.  Most of the items are a few dollars off and some of them even half price.  Five dollar saki bommers are the real star here.  I'd recommend this place for happy hour but as for the sushi it is sub-par."}
{"text":"I don't know why it's so hard to find really good sushi places anymore-  ordered caterpillar roll and cherry bomb roll.. They were okay. The cucumber salad was really lame, Which should be a staple.. Dirty martini ordered, no olives.. Beer ordered, no glass. Doubt I'll ever go back"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Mango Tango and the atmosphere.  Really nice sushi chefs at the bar, and the General Manager was extremely personable and attentive.  More upscale than I expected bar a college campus, and the sushi was fresh and tender."}
{"text":"Best Fish! I eat sushi atleast once a week and this place has the best salmon and all around sushi out of every place I've tried in Phoenix. Get the salmon nigiri and let the salmon just melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I loved Sushi 101 until tonight. My friend and I came in and were ready to leave after our dinner when the server came up and told us their system was down and it would be a few minutes until it was up. 50 minutes later, no ones telling us what's going on, the server is just apologizing repeatedly. Other people simply got fed up & left. My friend & I both work in a restaurant so we understood & were nice, even too nice, about the situation. After almost an hour, we wanted to leave & asked our server what was going on. She told us it still wasn't working & then she grabbed my card & began writing my card number down on a random piece of paper telling me they'll just charge me later... Very illegal. I politely told her I was not okay with that to which she responded by huffing & storming off & complaining to a coworker about 4 feet from us. We could see the entire staff & manager arguing & our server crying in the back. The manager told her to write our card numbers down to which she screamed that I won't let her. I tried to speak to the manager but he had his back turned to me & wouldn't turn around. Our server came back & we told her we had to leave to which she yelled at us & told us we weren't leaving without paying as if we were not trying to pay her for the past hour. I felt extremely disrespected & treated as if I was trying to skip out on the tab. She finally took our card numbers down through some old paper system & gave us the paper to sign and rudely said \"you don't even have to tip me\" and then left the paper on the host stand, with our card information in plain site. I would have tipped her, very well, even with the entire system being crashed if she hadn't been completely rude to us. As an employee of a very professional restaurant, I was shocked. The server was so disrespectful, we could see the entire staff screaming at each other, and at the end of the day no manager came to apologize or discounted anything or even said a word. Shame on you sushi 101, the worst restaurant experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"I know there are probably a variety of sushi restaurants in Tempe and Phoenix, but I have been going here for years. My sister and brother-in-law recommended this place to me about 6 years ago when I came to visit. And we continue to come back.  Since we've been here so many times, we actually befriended the owner, who is so kind and accommodating. She even let me host my sister's bridal shower here and closed off a section for us.  You can't go wrong with happy hour here! Some of our favorites that we always order are the Roll 101, Palm Springs Roll, ASU Roll and the Volcano Roll. I highly recommend the Palm Springs Roll since it has some spicy tuna, a little crunch with the tempura toppings, and light feel. In terms of appetizers, I would definitely go for the spring rolls, which come with this nice citrus-type sweet dipping sauce, and my all time favorite, agedashi tofu!   Although I love the food and the owner, service can be hit or miss, but definitely coming on a less busy day/time will make you see how great of a place it is and how much I enjoy coming back here when I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"If you don't go during happy hour its pretty overpriced. The bento box was a good deal though. California rolls, chicken teriyaki, rice, corn, and a salad for $7. Everything was okay. Definitely not the best sushi I have ever had, but not the worst either. In the long run, its close to my apartment so, if I do have a sushi craving, I'll probably be returning but I'll probably wait until happy hour."}
{"text":"Our server was very sweet. The octopus was odd, my mojito tasted like syrup and I sent it back. It actually was one of the worst mixed drinks I've ever had. It came out in this cute mason jar, then...womp womp. Nothing my date ordered was very appetizing. If you're a first-timer with sushi, or don't dine out often, sure, this place will pass. However, if you're looking for something authentic with beautiful presentation and decent drinks, try someplace else!!"}
{"text":"My daughter found something very disgusting in the caterpillar roll she ordered this afternoon from sushi 101."}
{"text":"The server who helped me was super friendly and fast so I hesitate to give a low rating (and this all might just be because they were busy) but the food was a hard MEH bordering on not edible.  And for the price I paid it should have been better.  I ordered mackerel sashimi (which I love and was super excited about), a couple rolls and veggie tempura.  The sashimi I ordered did not smell right.  I just couldn't stomach it so I fed it to my cat who loved it.  I added an extra star for him.  The rolls were okay but I asked for ginger and wasabi and got neither.  I didn't realize it until I got home and the rolls were bland without it.  The tempura was ok but kind of chewy and no longer crispy and there was no sauce for them.  I'm extremely disappointed and unless I'm willing to hop back in my car and go back to complain (I'm not) there's really nothing I can do about it beyond leaving this review.  I really don't think I'll go back after such a dismal experience.  Edit: the wasabi and ginger was included, hidden behind a plastic leaf and I didn't see it until I had finished the sushi.  I added a star because my stupidity isn't their fault."}
{"text":"There are so many good sushi places in the valley.  This place used to be a favorite but they increased the prices a little bit, so I don't go that often any more.  They have good sushi, good miso soup, decent salads, Nice drink selection, and a nice ambiance.    All and all I would say that Sushi 101 is  better than Raw, Blue Wasabi, Kona Grill, or Benni Hana's. That being said, there are a few sushi places in town that are better AKA fresher fish, better ingredients, and superior preparation.  Try: Sushi Creek:  If you don't mind a drive.  Very fresh, very well done.  Mido Sushi:  Authentic little place in Chlander with fast service and great, great, great prices.  Osakas Japanese steakhouse:  in Mesa is my new favorite sushi spot they do everything right!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, had some pretty mixed experiences. It seems pretty normal that if you get 4 items, two of them will be pretty good and the other two will kinda suck. I haven't experienced any items with an overtly bad odor, but sometimes I'll get a piece of fish with a 'this should've been served yesterday' texture. The pricing and usually the service are pretty good.  Also, there is a full bar here with happy hour and reverse happy hour and signs all over the place for their pitcher special and I'm not really sure why 4 people previously entered that this place serves no alcohol. There's plenty available if you need it.  By the way, just an observation from my latest visit, if I pay a $14.00 tab with a $20 bill, does it really need to be said that I will not be able to leave a decent 15-25ish% tip if my change includes a $1 bill and a $5 bill?"}
{"text":"Loved the vegan sushi here! It was truly stellar. Lots of options to choose from and each one I tried was delicious (especially the sweet potato roll). The only downside was that the server was unsure of which rolls were vegan, so we had to ask a few staff members to clarify. It seems that most of the vegetarian rolls are vegan, and the tempura is cooked in the same fryer as the fish so be mindful of that. Parking was easy in the big lot. Sushi took a little while to prepare, and it was 100% worth the wait. Appetizers came out quickly, so order those too if you're hungry."}
{"text":"This was a very affordable sushi place. Host was nice, seating was great, staff was friendly. Lunch special was also a go to."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Tempe!! Awesome happy hour prices and such a diverse menu, there really something for everyone with the many vegetarian options or bento boxes. I had yellowtail sashimi and it was only $10 for 5 really thick pieces I was really impressed. I also had the sweet potato roll and it was sooooo delicious and not too much rice! I thought I'd miss out on the fish but the sweet potato roll was so good I didn't even mind not having fish. Waitress was super nice!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi Ive had in Arizona! The egg drop soup was old and tasted like feet. Then our sushi took almost an hour and tasted like it had been sitting the whole time. The sushi was so bad after one bite I was afraid to eat anymore for fear of getting sick. At this point I told the waitress about how bad it was and all they did was drop a bill. I will never eat there again and recommend nobody else does! Ever!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sushi 101...we stopped in for a quick bite before a 9:30 comedy show at the Tempe Improv. Server was friendly, sushi was great (yellowtail sashimi was especially FAB!)...we were able to get in and out without sacrificing quality or service. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"sushi 101 was recommended by some co-workers who live in phoenix. they were right on with the recommendation.   unfortunately, we missed both happy hours! but the food was still reasonably priced. i got some miso soup which was really tasty, along with the shrimp tempura. my co-worker got a few rolls and some shrimp fried rice which she really enjoyed.  would definitely hit this place up again if given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"While I've had better sushi, nothing comes close to the quality for the happy hour prices. When it's busy the service can take a bit, but I quickly learned what times and days to go to get immediate service. Absolutely perfect for a college student that needs a sushi fix."}
{"text":"Sydney is the best server ever!!! She always keeps my water filled and has the best recommendations!!! Love her."}
{"text":"Sushi can get really expensive so I was excited to find a place with a great happy hour. I think it's from 4-7 and then 9-close everyday. Sushi is half off! Try the Las Vegas roll, it's one of my favorites. I wouldn't suggest going any other time beside happy hour because the sushi is never consistent. I think there are different sushi chefs. It's all good just some are better than others."}
{"text":"Its ok.... Its ASU and kids dont really know where the good sushi is. Well its not in AZ lol.   Its descent prices are way too high"}
{"text":"I was driving by and decided to stop in for a quick happy hour dinner. Service was typical college girls (um... like duh...) Ambiance is nice, besides the fact that I was surrounded by less then average intelligence college kids. Sushi SUCKED. I ordered the spider roll (really bad), Alaska (tasteless) and a glass of house Chardonnay. If it were not for the ok wine and ambiance, this place would have received 1 star. Oh, and the parking sucks too. The spots were pretty small, I was totally expecting a ding on my door. Thank goodness I beat both lot neighbors out."}
{"text":"This place wasn't horrible by any means, but it wasn't \"A-ok\" as a 3 star review suggests. It was \"meh\". The sushi was ok. The service was fine. The ambiance, however, was definitely lacking. I know it can be tough to do sushi in Phoenix, but I've had way better."}
{"text":"Very few tables on a Wednesday and it took 45 minutes to get our rolls.  Rolls were not good and fish didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar and ordered happy hour items.  Was thrilled that happy hour goes till 7pm on a Friday night!  Tried:  Spicy Garlic edamame- the flavor was good but they were shiny with grease.  That was odd  Gyoza - really good  Cucumber salad - it was long grated pieces of skin.  This was the worst thing we had.  Vegetable tempura - really yummy.  California Roll - my daughter thought it had a bit to much \"krab\" for her kid tastes.  Asparagus Tempura roll - good!  Philly roll w/ smoked salmon - really liked!  Sake bomber - $5.50 for large hot sake and large beer.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I went today because my brother took me there for my birthday Lunch. We then have a seat while looking up at the menu. While looking up at the menu, the server didn't even ask what we want for a drink. Not even until we finished ordering and I had to mention of what we want for drink. The food come fast. And had no problem at all. But the problem for me is when my drink is empty. The server keeps walking by our table without noticing that my drink is empty. I tried to call him several times but he didn't notice me. When he finally noticed me and I told him what I want, his expression wasn't friendly at all. That moment we know we just need to leave and ask for the bill. Our server name is Bayan  (according to the receipt). WOW, WHAT A WAY TO RUIN MY BIRTHDAY!"}
{"text":"This is my friend's favorite sushi place because they will make her sushi with just plain rice(not sushi rice). I tend to be a bit more of a traditional sushi lover so even though their roll list is impressive, the quality leaves something to be desired. I am not a huge fan but I have had worse. The fish is mediocre and only worth the price they are asking for when they run their happy hour. The drinks make the trip though. So if you are looking to have some drinks and a little sushi on the side, this would be a good place to go."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever. I hate when sushi looks dried out right when you get it. I wouldn't eat here if you paid me and you would have to because it costs so much."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 has been my go-to for late night eats for the past 8 years. They have a ton of options for vegetarians; their sweet potato roll has to be the best vegetarian roll I have had anywhere! They also offer happy hour prices on sushi and some appetizers from 4pm-7pm and 9pm-close."}
{"text":"Great place for reasonably priced, fresh sushi and yummy drinks. Tonight I ordered two different types of saki bombs - kirin and hot sake, and then Ace cider and fireball. My friends and I got the rainbow roll, the spicy krab, golden California, baked Alaskan, philly, and dragon roll. It was all super fresh and the service was prompt. I love coming here for happy hour!! They also gave my whole table shots for my birthday for free so that was great"}
{"text":"Sushi 101 should rename themselves \"Sushi for Meatheads\". This was seriously the worst sushi I've ever had.  So bad, that I refused to eat it.   My sister and I got take-out. The inside of the place seems nice and clean and bright.  There's a bar with drink specials that are named like specialty sushi rolls.   But there are several TVs with various games on, at all times.   My theory is that they do all of this to distract you from the terrible food you are about to receive.    The sushi was poorly rolled.  It wouldn't even stay together.  Also, the meat and fillings inside the sushi were in extremely small portions.  For example, I ordered the special of the day which was an eel crunch roll. It was supposed to be eel, cream cheese, and avocado.  About three end pieces had absolutely no meat in them and the pieces that did were minimal.  The roll itself was 3 inches wide by 5 inches long. If you looked at one piece there was about 1/2 inch of filling and 1 1/4 inches of rice all around.  That is a ridiculously large amount of rice for no discernible reason.   Besides that, I think the only thing that was actually in the entire roll was cream cheese.   Even their soy sauce was substandard.   Even though the food is terrible, the atmosphere seems conducive to large groups and people trying to take in a game in a place other than a sports bar.   I will never go back here (and not just because I live in Philly)."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst sushi joints in town. Why is everything covered in their stupid sauce (which is just watered down siracha, by the way)?   The quality of fish is horrendous. The tuna was old/dull looking, the salmon seemed rotten. I got a little happy when i saw they had yellow tail only to be served a weird colored, trash smelling piece of sashimi. What a let down.   I hate being so negative, but I really get mad with bad sushi and this place was bad."}
{"text":"This was actually the first sushi place I tried in the Tempe area. I ordered takeout on their website, and navigation was a breeze. They even called to double check on special instructions that I had left them. Upon my arrival, I was politely greeted, and my order was immediately handed to me. So overall great customer service, and good food. The only issue would be the presentation of the food. It was a bit messy, and the rice was falling apart along with other parts of the roll. However, it satisfied my sushi craving, and I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Just like Yelp says, I have experienced better.  I came here late night with a friend after getting our ears pierced. Wasn't completely empty, but the staff had already begun closing up shop for the night. We were seated immediately. The waiter pretty much told us that we needed to order within the next five minutes or else the kitchen wouldn't prepare our food for us. We were there 45 minutes before the closing time.   Their rolls menu is a bit confusing, because it has one side with the prices for about 50 different rolls, and on the back there is a description for only about half of them. We ordered four of the rolls that were described on the back. Ended up going with the Las Vegas roll, Shrimp Tempura roll, Caterpillar roll and Spicy Tuna roll and miso soup to start.   The miso soup was very below average. It had a fishy taste, which was awkward and didn't smell pleasant. On the upside, it was steamy hot. The rolls came out about 15 minutes later and to be honest, I was not impressed at all.   The Las Vegas roll was smothered in some sort of sweet orange colored sauce which was very unappetizing on top of a cream cheese, avocado, and smoked tuna deep-fried contraption. The spicy tuna roll was not cold- rather lukewarm- and was not spicy at all. The caterpillar roll was actually pretty decent, but had more avocado on top than was necessary and not enough fish inside. The tempura roll was the best out of all of them- which says a lot about the quality of their food. The tempura around the shrimp was a little soggy, and this roll was also lukewarm which was very unappetizing.   The service was pretty bland, nothing special. Prices weren't bad either. We split the bill and paid about $20 bucks each, which isn't terrible for 4 rolls, 2 soups and 2 drinks.   Overall, I probably won't be back in the near future.   Pictures of the food are posted."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the drinks were not strong enough for the price I must say one shot was highly priced! I would go back for the food though!"}
{"text":"First of all, this rating is mainly based on the food and as 2 stars is described above as \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" is just the perfect description. I came here with a group on a Monday night and it was pretty empty. It was happy hour which I was excited for only to learn that the happy hour prices were not your typical half off -- it was merely 1 or 2 dollars off, maybe 3. Pretty disappointing if you ask me. I gave them the benefit of the doubt that their food must be pretty amazing if they won't shave off much for happy hour but I ordered the Ahi Tuna salad (regular price $13, happy hour price $12)... which did nothing close to blowing me away. It was lettuce, carrots, avocado, with lightly seared-on-the-sides ahi tuna. I kept waiting for the flavor to pop in but it just didn't do it for me. I gave them another chance to redeem themselves by trying my friend's sushi roll. I'm not sure what it was called but it was basically a California roll with a piece of unagi on top. And like the salad it was just OK. It wasn't the freshest I've ever had and with the abundance of more decent sushi/Japanese places around the valley, I probably would never choose to come to Sushi 101 again based on the food. The service I must say was fantastic - our girl was very sweet and accommodating. She even didn't hesitate to take our photo for us until we were satisfied with it. I liked her enough to leave her additional tip on top of the added gratuity for our party."}
{"text":"I don't know good sushi. I like happy hour. I like Sake Bombers. I am fully aware that I live in a desert and sushi would be so much better if I lived by a body of water.   That being said, I've never had a bad experience at Sushi 101 and I've been here a LOT.  I used to work at a sushi bar with an absolutely insane owner. Contrary to the norm, sushi is the one food that you actually crave more of when you spend more time around it. When I worked at a bagel place, I didn't want to look at a bagel for years afterward. When I was working at this sushi place, I became some kind of sushi fiend. I wanted it ALL THE TIME.    However, as previously noted, the owner was a crazy person. He fired me twice, only to call hours later asking why I wasn't at work because it was getting busy. He constantly yelled at employees and accused everyone of stealing. We had the turnover of a Whitechapel whorehouse. Needless to say, this did not lead to me wanting to be at my job more often than absolutely necessary to pay my bills (and feed my new found sushi addiction).  So, I would go to work, make money, crave sushi, and then head to Sushi 101 for my fix.  As I've mentioned several times, I have no shame in my love for happy hour. If a restaurant has happy hour every day of the week, it would have to suck pretty hard for me to give it any lower than 4 stars. Sushi 101 has great happy hour specials on drinks, apps, rolls, and nigiri 7 days a week. Coda B. and I can usually have an all-out feast here for less than $50 (and we can put down some sushi).  The food is always good. Even though I don't know what good sushi is. It's all good to me, which means it must really all be bad, and I'm just not cool enough to have had the actual good sushi. Though I have had sushi in New York and LA and San Diego and at several very nice restaurants elsewhere. That was good too. But I'm not one to turn my nose up at salmon nigiri just because it only cost $2.50 and I ate it in a desert. BTW, their salmon nigiri is really really good. We almost always have to order more. And it's $2.50 and you don't have to drive to an ocean to get it. Which makes it even better.  The staff is full of ASU students, which should be expected given the location. They can get overwhelmed, but I'm a real easy customer when it comes to sushi so I've never had a problem with it. Those 22 oz beers keep me occupied for a while. The owner doesn't appear to verbally berate and/or fire-bomb (I made up that word, it's where you fire someone out of nowhere, preferably mid-shift) employees for no reason, so that's definitely a plus in my book as well.  Go during happy hour. It's a great value for good times and good sushi (even though I don't know what good sushi is)."}
{"text":"cheap saki bombs and great happy hour sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the money or craving of sushi. If you ask for eel sauce they will give you teriyaki sauce!! I asked our waiter why she gave me teriyaki sauce and she said that's what the chefs do and people don't usually notice. What sushi place can't give you a real side of eel sauce?! So over this place. They used to be good but it seems like they'd rather save money than customers."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place...ever! The moonwalk roll here is the best I have ever tasted. I love that they have happy hour, and the prices are amazing."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Sushi 101.  Love the happy hour menu and drinks.  Crunchy CA roll, calamari roll, Philly roll with the smoked salmon - yum, yum yum!!   Service is good (but we're really easy) and the food is fresh.  Love the close proximity to my job - makes it easy to satisfy cravings when they hit!   A few months back we visited and wanted to try one of their new beer flights.  Unfortunately they were having issues and none of the drafts were available.  We haven't been in the mood for beer with sushi since, so we haven't sampled any."}
{"text":"First I want to say that the staff was awesome.  Super friendly and helpful and didn't try to rush us to order or finish.  We went because they have a ton of vegan items on their menu and we were super excited to try them out.  We ordered spicy edamame, which was probably the best item we had.  We also ordered tofu steaks, and multiple vegan rolls.  Nothing we received was hot, only lukewarm which seemed a little strange.  The tofu steaks were squishy in the middle and had no flavor.  We probably wouldn't ever go there to eat again, but would to hang out at the bar for a decent draft beer selection, some edamame and some good customer service."}
{"text":"So hard to find a place with vegetarian sushi and love that this place has multiple options! very romantic atmosphere that is perfect for date night. always a stop when i visit tempe"}
{"text":"Best fish?  Nahhh Best ambiance?  Nahhh  Super great happy hour prices!  YES! Hooray!  Only go during happy hour.  Which is almost all the time.  This place is great if you're needin' some sushi and on a budget"}
{"text":"Wow this place has gone down hill big time. Used to be that the sushi was ok for a quick sushi fix but now it is barely passable as sushi not nasty old fish. I came in and ordered the sushi combo (6 assorted nigiri and a Cali roll) I asked to switch to a spicy tuna not the Cali roll and was told there was an upcharge on the already $16 combo but whatever it's what I wanted and all the good specialty rolls were over priced. Also most places charge for changing combos and it was only $1 so nothing to hefty. The charge did include miso soup and a small salad. It was all bad.   The miso soup was way to grainy even when well stirred. The salad was bland except for the taste of bad tomato. The spicy tuna didn't taste anywhere near fresh or right. All the nigiri was just off on taste especially the eel which tasted like dirty water from a hose. And the salmon which was just bad. Another piece was chewy and hard to get down. Even the shrimp piece tasted old.   I will never come back here again. What used to be a close to campus option has sadly been beat out in taste and price by the sushi to go place in the Memorial Union on campus.   Save yourself some money an bad taste and go to cafe wasabi, sake bomber or ra if you need sushi around here."}
{"text":"YUM! This was my third time here and I love this place. They truly have something for everyone.   I love vegetarian sushi, and my boyfriend doesn't eat  any kind of fish, so it's usually hard for us to find a place to eat. Sushi 101 offers a full menu for him, and lots of vegetarian sushi options for me.   He loves the teriyaki chicken and rice platter. Always cooked fresh with yummy grilled vegetables.   I love the sweet potato roll and the asparagus tempura roll. Both come with avocado inside and are topped with crunch. SO delicious and definitely made fresh.   Most recently we had a waitress named Chelsea. She was super sweet and very on top of her game! We will definitely be asking for her from now on."}
{"text":"*First, I have to get this off my chest. I am a consistent patron of this sushi bar, and it gets annoying seeing so many people give flack to Sushi 101. I have brought many a friend here, and it's created many sushi lovers....Believe me, I am a witness! Is it the highest quality fine grade-A sushi you will ever have? No. Can I say this is the best place for sushi, don't go anywhere else? NO! Is it an amazing and price-efficient way to learn how to sushi, and let you try things before you branch out? YES! As a foodie, a native Phoenician and a proud Sun Devil Alumni, I definitely take issue to those who cast patrons off as slack-jawed kids.*  OK, I feel better. The 101 is a treat if you are a Sun Devil or even a local Tempe resident. They have all the generic types of sushi and have some of the best happy hour deals in town. I can't tell you how great it feels to know you can get a big ol' Sake Bomb with your friends and not freak out about prices. You get what you pay at happy hour, which they have two of. It allows everyone ample time to get out and enjoy their sushi at a good price. Also, one thing rarely utilized here is their lunch specials, which are amazing. I took advantage of this once, and if you think the deals at happy hour are good, their bento boxes are killer.    The quality is where 101 takes its flack, and rightfully so. But for the most part besides a couple dishes (mainly spicy salmon), you should expect to have excellent tasting sushi The special rolls they make are also great, and can play to a variety of pallets.   For these deals, I give it 4 stars. Its probably more deserving of 3 1/2 *'s, considering quality, but adding in the amount of daily happy hour considering other local sushi restaurants, this takes the cake. I definitely suggest you branch out besides here, we do have some great sushi bars here in AZ, but this is an awesome deal if you're in the Tempe area and want some sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi is average, the price is expensive if you don't go during happy hour, the food is clean and fresh, but its okay sushi...  Kind of spendy if you came on a sunday at 1pm...happy hour is m-f only around 3pm to 7pm, and 9pm till close...somthing like that dont quote me on it...."}
{"text":"Came in on Monday night for my friends birthday dinner.. She wanted to come to sushi 101 at 5pm because they supposedly had a good happy hour. I completely beg to differ. They have many items on happy hour, yes, but there is hardly any discount!!! You can get a $12 roll for $11 or a $14 roll for $12.. Like that's it? 1-3 dollars off?  Our server was something else! I wish I knew her name, I don't even think she told us what it was. She was dark haired with heavy eye liner and a Harry Potter  dragon tattoo on her forearm. We were all wondering why she was being so short and rude. She literally had the dirtiest look on her face and acted miserable. When the checks came out we learned that she added a 20% auto gratuity to all of our tabs. If this restaurant cares anything about their customer service reputation I think they should remove the auto gratuity because it encourages servers to be lazy/rude/etc."}
{"text":"Superb sushi place for an out-of-state visitor! After my friend and I landed in Phoenix, we needed to eat something stat. We stumbled upon this sushi place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Not only was the food delicious, our server, Davin was super helpful not only with menu recommendations but with some nightlife options to do around the area.  A+++ sushi rolls we ordered: * Cheetah  * Monsoon Roll * Grizzly Bear  * Diamondback - per recommendation  And of course, dessert - 101 Brownie. Delish!  Date Visited: 2/23/18"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Teriyaki Bowl Great service. Our server, Dakota. was  Great and had a beautiful smile :)"}
{"text":"I hate writing negative reviews, but yelpers of the world need to know about this. So...here's the deal...  Going out for drinks with an old friend and we decided we had better eat before getting our drunkenness on. The decision was then made to grab some sushi and although my recommendation was Sakebombers on Broadway and McClintock, she recommend Sushi 101. I've never been, it's close to my place...why not?  I'll give you the good before the bad...   - Cool atmosphere for sure (t.v.'s with the game on, ASU chicks abound, decent layout inside the place),   - Excellent outside sitting area  - Great location   - The flavor and quality of the rolls and food in general is not bad.  HOWEVER, here's \"why not\":  - We got there, asked for a booth and got seated at a middle table...ok, fine.   - Ordered a Bacardi Coke tall...waitress didn't know what I meant. Literally had to explain it to her.  - The calamari appetizer came to the table literally 30 seconds before the first two rolls we ordered were delivered. The other two rolls we ordered didn't make it to the table for another five minutes.  - The presentation of the rolls was HORRIBLE. Both rolls, for each of our orders, were on the same plate, which is obviously fine. BUT they weren't presented in any type of meaningful way...they were just there. All mixed up with some of the pieces on their sides, some upright, some stuck to other pieces just like they were literally thrown onto the plate. I mean, I couldn't tell which roll was which and neither could the waitress so...?? Yeahhh...  - So, we eat some of the food, order some Sake and step out for a smoke. The waitress watched us walk outside. A could minutes later the waitress comes out and says \"Oh, there you guys are. I thought you left. Sorry guys but your table was bussed. I'll take the sake off your bill.\" I mean I get it...mistakes happen. Everybody's human and it was really cool of her to at least openly acknowledged that we should not have to pay for the sake...But what about the rest of my dinner?!?! There was still a very good sized portion of sushi that I ended up paying for which we were not able to eat! My friend had at least half of her order bussed, about a third of mine and almost a whole order of spicy edamame.  - To top it all off, this place was expensive. Even after the sake got taken off, it was still $100+. If I enjoyed the experience then the money wouldn't have been a consideration. But, I paid $100+ for a lackluster dinner that I didn't even get to finish.  Nope, this isn't a place for me. Sakebombers...I'm sorry! Please take me back..."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 will always be one of my favorite places to get sushi in Az. It's the type of place where you can bring a newbie sushi eater: plenty of variety so one could easily find something to their taste.   For vegetarians too! Every time I come here I will either have the Crisp Green or Asparagus Tempura (add cream cheese) and I am never disappointed. They also have a unique spin with the edamame: they flavor the pods with this spicy garlic-iness. So good!  We also got the chicken katsu and chicken yaki soba. Huge plates of food! I love the Korean BBQ sauce that comes with the katsu dish and the noodles were quite tasty.   However, their specialty rolls are where its at: unique, hearty, and tasty. I just experienced the Black and Yellow as well as the Grizzly for the first time and they were scrumptious. Both have a shrimp tempura foundation but the BY has spicy krab inside and topped with seared yellowtail on top - it is a wonderful merger of flavors. But the Grizzly subs baked salmon inside and tops with fresh salmon...and this roll is fresh and filling. Interestingly enough, we ended with something almost like a dessert roll, the Lollipop. Each piece comes out on a skewer and the roll is filled with eel and cream cheese then deep fried = yum.  All together, perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"Do come here if:  1. You want cheap drinks.  2. You want to start happy hour early (4-7 and an amazing 9-close).  3. You want to find a seat easily. Sit at the bar, by the way. The no-bullshit bartender is cool and boyfriend and I had a great time joking with him and talking drinks.  4. You want cheap food. $1.50 edamame and $3-4 rolls and apps during happy hours is unbeatable.  HOWEVER, do not come here if:  1. You want amazing food. I pay for what I get so I'm not terribly dissapointed with how average the sushi is. But when you're drinking, who cares that much, anyway? (I don't.)  Just try it because it's not RA and it's close to campus. I think the RA on Mill smells worse than this place, anyway."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this little hideaway for lunch today and from reading previous Yelp reviews, I did not expect to see much. There weren't a lot of people there so we were seated promptly and our waitress, Arielle, was very attentive.  The sushi was fresh and the price was quite affordable.  This is not a place for those seeking ambiance or romance.  It's a just a place for okay sushi and cheap drinks.  Based on the location, it seems to appeal more to the college crowd.  I probably won't be back even if my friend suggests it again."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times now and I can't believe I haven't given them a review. So here it is.  Food is delicious! You can taste how fresh the sushi is. And they don't hold back like some other sushi places that serve pretty much rice rolls.  Service is great! I've never had any servers that I was displeased with. They've all been fast and friendly! We've even had a manager come by to help us when our sever was busy with a big party. The manager made sure he explained to us the situation and continuously came by to check up on us.   I'm extremely happy with this place and will be recommending and returning for sushi!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour specials really aren't that great. Most of the \"happy hour\" prices were just a dollar cheaper than what it usually is.   Food is fair - not great, but not too bad either. I've had better sushi else where.   Saki Bomb during happy hour is pretty affordable. $5 isn't too shabby.   Customer Service - Excellent! Our waitress made sure our cups were always full and always made sure we were doing okay."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but came with three of my best blokes. It was very Asiany but when I walked in they were blasting some Adele which makes any situation great!  5 stars all the way!  Hello from the other side."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch at work and they were fast,  or busy and polite. The rolls did take kind of a long time to come out but we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. We were pleased to see that in this busy complex that this place was not busy at all. The size of this restaurant will fool you. It is huge inside! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here after the comedy show because it was convenient.  I rated the Volcano Roll at 4 stars.  She rated the Rainbow Roll at 2 stars.  She didn't even finish and left the rest there.  She said the food made her feel sick later that night and this place should be called Sushi 911 instead.  lol  My sushi was fully cooked.  She ate the raw stuff."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for ~4 years now, and while it's still my favorite sushi happy hour, the service hasn't been the best recently. Over the summer, I went on my birthday and our orders got mixed up, the bill wasn't correct, et cetera (which is okay, mistakes happen). I'm writing this review now because I had even worse service last week when my food took over 40min. My boyfriend had already gotten and eaten all of his food before they brought my sushi out, and there were only 3 other groups seated in the restaurant! The waitress apologized in passing but at that point I was very hungry and frustrated, especially when it came to footing the bill as they took a while to bring that over, too. Food is still pretty great but they need to get better staff, and I'd have been happier if they had covered my ~$6 roll that came out so late (or at least thrown in a free appetizer while I was waiting and starving.)"}
{"text":"Dining out is a social experience (unless you are eating alone). When you want to go to an upscale sushi restaurant, you need to follow three criteria.  1. You have friends who are willing to pay $8-$12 for a roll of sushi. 2. You have friends who have $20 to pay for two rolls of sushi. 3. You have friends who won't complain after paying $20 for two rolls of sushi.  When I was in college, I didn't meet criteria #1 and #3.  Sushi 101 is cheap during happy hour. That is why I will keep this restaurant close to my heart. It's the only place where you and a friend  can purchase ridiculous amounts of sushi for $24 during happy hour. I had a lot of good times here and this restaurant is definitely worth 4 stars!"}
{"text":"My go to sushi place while living in Arizona. The sushi is always excellent and the stay is very friendly. Near campus so it may be a little busy at times but overall love sushi 101. They have brown rice too which is convenient. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good sushi and sake bombs!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place from my Co-Workers. We came here as a group of about 9. The food was awesome and very tasty. The service was good but a bit slow. The food took a while to get out, but it's worth the wait. I figured since we were a big party was the reason.   My Girlfriend and I came a second time on our own. The service was again slow, and the food took a while to arrive. But then again, the food is worth the wait. I'm sure they have to prepare precisely that can't be rushed and I understand. The Servers are nice but don't check back too often. Something that can be improved, but other than that, this place is great."}
{"text":"- A Sushi Joint That Cuts Corners -  I wanted to enjoy my experience at sushi 101 but several factors hindered the experience;  1.) the music : blaring makes your ears ring terrible acoustics   2.) the location; corner of the lot hard to get to   3.) the food : beef ramen ($10) broth with chicken strips, really? Pls attend \"Ramen 101\" at ASU. Sushi ($10) presentation was mediocre, my friend wouldn't even finish it.   4.) ambience was \"dragging\"  Please someone rescue this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am always very satisfied with all aspects of my dining experience at Sushi 101.   The sushi itself is very good. The rolls are always tight. The nigiri are always fresh, generous portions (spicy scallop...omg).  The service is always fantastic. Who I am assuming is the owner (she looks the part if you know what I mean) is always up front to greet with a big smile. The servers and managers are very attentive and nice, also.   The happy hour prices are amazing! I usually sit down (with Georgeann G.) to a meal of three rolls, four nigiri, and an appetizer and the bill is always a reasonable amount (usually around twenty each with tip). If you were to go in and keep it to one roll and one nigiri you could easily spend less than ten dollars.  The scenery is always great too. There's a really great vibe about this restaurant with all the young college life around in the heart of ASU.   I'm a big fan and I'm sure most would be... definitely a great place to check out."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites!  The heart attack roll is the best!  Very affordable and fresh."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this place all the time about a year or so ago. The only reason I stopped is because their sushi chefs either didn't care anymore or just didn't know what they were doing. No I am not a sushi snob but when your roll starts to fall apart on you as soon as you pick it up with your chopsticks, not a good sign. Like I said, I was a regular for awhile but something changed. I have been back maybe twice since last summer and its has been ok but just not the same. The owner is a sweetheart though."}
{"text":"Ok first of all, if you order a side of eel sauce they will give you a side of teriyaki sauce... We asked the waitress why she gave us the teriyaki sauce when we asked for eel sauce and she said that's what they always do... Obviously to save money because they're so cheap!!! All of their speciality rolls have spicy tuna in them.. Because again they're cheap. The saki bombs all come out in plastic cups... Again because they're cheap. If you want some nice sushi, stay away from this place. All you get here is cheap cheap cheap for pretty expensive rolls and drinks."}
{"text":"One of the best local sushi restaurants I have had the pleasure to dine at. Sushi 101 has by far the freshest fish in Tempe and the best appetizer. They have happy hour 7 days a week (3-7 & 9-close) and super cheap sake bombs every Monday. Also, the service is top notch. Specifically, Alexander is a attentive, quick, knows the menu well, and extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I'm new to sushi and when we met up with a couple of friends on a Tuesday night, I'm glad I did. I had the opportunity to try 5 or 6 different kinds and I liked them all. When I go back I'll be getting the golden state roll, it was delicious! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Sushi is always on point and sake bomb Monday's are lit. My favorite roll is the moonwalk...like, who thought tempura sweet potato, avo and lemon could go together so well? Service is always great, I've had Sydney a couple times and she's absolutely hilarious and does her job."}
{"text":"Slow service, gyoza came out cold. Got my miso AFTER my meal (the seaweed was crunchy and there were two tiny bits of tofu that's it) drinks came out close to 20 minutes after we ordered. The sake bombs were reasonably priced during happy hour and my roll was okay but not worth $12. Disappointed for sure"}
{"text":"Oh my word, did I spend most days after class here!  Their happy hour is fantastic, the sushi is always delicious and the sake... oh the sake! I also brought people here who visited me in the desert, they loved it as well.  All in all I love this place, every time I visit ASU I have to stop by for a nicely priced roll and sake bombs!  I highly recommend it, it was delicious and affordable on a college student's budget-what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"It's with a heavy heart to say 101 is no longer our sushi of choice. Under new management or something they have decreased portions and now rely heavily on rice making up the vast majority of the rolls contents. This place used to be well above average and our go-to spot. More recently they have altered our favorite menu items and it's just no longer appealing. They used to serve 5-6 jalepanos with their orders, now it's 3. The price is the same. The rolls went from having a great balance to nearly 80-90% rice. I'm no review sniper or paid promoter but if you have a car then you're way better off going to sake bomber. Better service and now, officially, much better sushi and value. Hope this helps and good luck on your search for sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 has decent sushi. I think they could have more flavor, but their rolls definitely aren't bad. I've also had their lunch special with teriyaki chicken. The vegetables on that plate were done well because they had just the right amount of crispness left. Flavor on the chicken was slightly more sour than your typical teriyaki, but not bad. Overall, it's a decent place to get sushi, but I do think I've had better."}
{"text":"Just picked up a take-out order. Was supposed to have a chicken and beef bowl. Got home, and it was only chicken. In addition, for $2 extra, I ordered brown rice. The rice was hard and sticky. I'm not going back to this crappy restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! Great selection of vegetarian items! I recommend the Krisp Greens roll, it has lettuce along with asparagus, avocado and carrot. They top it with a vinaigrette that makes the roll taste like salad sushi. It's light and delicious. I was also impressed with the amount of avocado they put in my roll, no skimping on the fillings!   Cheap, yummy vegetarian sushi!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place yet! They have one of the best happy hours, in my opinion. This is always the place I go if I am craving sushi. I like to be entertained so I am usually at the sushi bar watching the sushi chefs at work drinking my huge bottle of Kirin Light. I am not a fan of the raw stuff so I go for the tempura rolls and vegetarian rolls and they are fantastic.  I always order too much but can you blame me? I have never had a bad experience here. I also love the location. It is right next to the Tempe Improv and right at the corner of a major intersection. Every time I go in there, it is busy! Whenever someone asks for a sushi recommendation, this is the place I recommend."}
{"text":"Food- order 2 sushi rolls for half price after 9pm. Pretty good basic rolls no complaints. Also orders their steak and rice meal and that was really good.   Went with three of my friends who are visiting from out of town and ordered drinks but got turned down because they said our IDs were fake. Based off of their judgment. So that kind of ruined my experience because they were only questioned because of the different state. When scanned they said the came up in the system but because of the thickness of the card they think it's fake. Had a passport to verify my identity and was told that once I was denied one they weren't allowed to accept any other identification."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy edemame and some bento boxes at lunch. Excellent place all around with a good location and really good service. I highly recommend the spicy edemame. Did I mention the spicy edemame?"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat quality at good sushi house prices. Do not bother. I've had much better sushi at the grocery store. The wasabi was whipped to make it airy and look like more. Don't know why, but it was the mildest wasabi I've ever seen. Fish was all on the border of going fishy."}
{"text":"I dont know what everyone is complaining about here, There sushi is fresh and is excellent for the price during happy hour. I can order about 6 rolls for under 25 dollars. This is not by any means a world class sushi restaurant, but it is a great local restaurant serving the Tempe area. And people were complaining about service? Every time I have eaten here, my server has been great.  Sushi 101 has consistent sushi, and I leave happy with a belly full of fish every time!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the seaweed salad and sweet potato tempura roll. Great happy hour prices and close to campus. The wait is never long for a table and its definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great-tasting sushi !!! We had vegetable tempura and my cousin asked for the zuchini and sweet potatoes only. It was so good -- crunchy on the outside but hot and juicy on the inside --- that we ordered another batch.   Next was the rainbow roll. It was the best-looking and well-made sushi among the sushi rolls we ordered that night. It looked like it was hard to make with all the ingredients inside and the way it was rolled with the tuna and salmon covering the rice was beautiful. It was delicious. Specially made too :P  Then we had the spicy tuna roll. The first time I set my eyes on it --- made me think that this was done by an amateur or probably a new sushi chef. It was not very appealing with the rice sticking out of the seaweed wrapper and the tuna was all mushy and probably cut with a dull knife (learned from experience making sashimi). I ate it happily with no complaints =). Itadakimasu!!! It was really good. I dipped it in wasabi and soy sauce and it became more spicy!!! It's even good without the wasabi and soy sauce.  The last dish was the golden state roll. It looked like an embutido. Not so beautifully done either (the partitioning of the the stuff inside was not that well defined --- like in the cookbooks or in TV hehe). I asked my cousin what it was, she said it was california maki covered in rice flour then fried. It was also very good. Crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside ...If only I weren't so full, I could have eaten it all."}
{"text":"A great sushi place for the area!! I was visiting my boyfriend and he was working for the day and I walked on over to Sushi 101. Great menu with tons of options. It was awesome sitting at the bar watching the sushi get made made it tons more entertaining. Their happy hour looks pretty awesome too, I haven't tried it but definitely will be something to try since it looks like a pretty awesome deal!"}
{"text":"No. No. No. I've had it with this place. I gave it several tries, I even tried to convince myself that it wasn't THAT bad, but it is!  - The sushi is TOO small. Really? It looks like a child's version of sushi. My god, it would take eight rolls to fill me.  For the same price, I'll keep going to the one restaurant at tempe martkeplace. I'll take pretentiousness and overdone japanese furniture over crappy sushi anyday.   Sigh. I wanted to like you, Sushi 101. But you're like that boy I dumped in the 10th grade who talked a lot of talk but ended up being a total bore."}
{"text":"Usually sushi restaurants, that know they have bellow average nigiri, make up for it by having unique and tasty rolls. This place fails on both counts....  Nigiri: Fish was stale. Almost like it was frozen just a few minutes ago, so there was almost no taste. The rice was disgusting.  Rolls: We didn't finish most of the rolls. Not because there was too much food, but because it was hard keeping it down.  Why two stars? Well the service was great, as were their miso soup and green tea. So if you want some tasty miso with tea.... this is your place.  My friend from Arizona begged me not to give them a bad review, because he comes here a lot. This is the best I can do.... I was seriously going to write something a lot worse."}
{"text":"Just about everything has a happy hr. price and the sushi is good. I came here with my best Friend and we enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Of course we came for the happy hour, the happy hour deals are great! we ordered a heart attack roll, spider roll and the sashimi albacore tuna! All REALLY good rolls, we also ordered edamame, a BIG bowl of miso soup and two Saki Bombers, all for around $25 dollars on happy hour! It was inexpensive and GOOD food! Even off happy hour they are reasonably priced! I will return again! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Had to be a new waitress because she wasn't very good. Good effort though. The manager was very friendly and visited each table to ensure everyone was doing well. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for groups. They have a decent happy hour. The sushi is very americanized, but it tastes pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Sushi. Happy Hour. Months of deprivation over. Sign me up. The pros: excellent food. Amusing shirts. Candles on rice. The cons: the waiting. And waiting. And waiting.  Only 3 tables with people in the entire place. But the food. Seriously fresh.  So.. yeah. Come on down."}
{"text":"From 4-7 on weekdays, this place is five stars because the happy hour is pretty rad. The rest of the time, the sushi is good, and the service ain't bad either. Sushi purists might not appreciate the Sun Devil staffing  (blondes in kimonos) but that sort of thing doesn't bother me too much.   It is very non-pretentious, which seems to be the norm in Tempe but not in Scottsdale, so you can pop in and grab some sushi in a more laid back atmosphere without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Sushi 101.  It's so clever. Sitting just across from ASU main campus beckoning young hopefuls over with the promise of a survey level course in the appreciation of the best japanese cultural import since anime.  Sure, it may be a gentle introduction for sushi virgins, but there's plenty here for a seasoned veteran to sink their teeth into.  Jake has the right idea.  Go during happy hour.  I have eaten here dozens of times and the Sushi has always been good.  I'm partial to the maguro and albacore and their dragon or unagi rolls.  Because nothing says, \"Kiss me baby!\" like some eel in a sweet sweet sauce!.  But hey, it's your own trip. In general the drinks and sushi are fairly reasonably priced.  I've never felt out of place there and the service has always been good.  There's a wall of polaroids of people posing with their heads stuck through a Sumo wrestler cut out which is mildly amusing.  But I go here for the sweet, succulent, tender, delicious and might I add raw fish."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and they have some of the best service and sake bomber specials around! I always recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Great place with a cool college vibe. The rolls are unique to the community and the service is awesome!  $1.50 beers during happy hour!"}
{"text":"I had the dragon rolls and they where fantastic. I asked the sushi chef at the bar what each fish was and he educated me through everything. I probably ate with my eyes because I ordered a poke bowl after, lol."}
{"text":"Food is sub-par/prices average. But hey, I'm from Ca."}
{"text":"The food is very good here, my problem is the price. It's just too expensive in my opinion. The bill came up to 70 dollars and this was just for lunch. I felt like it could have been about 20 dollars cheaper for what we got, in any case, service was pretty good and the flavors were there."}
{"text":"They had happy hour when we went, which was a plus. We ordered a couple of rolls from the happy hour menu (red tiger roll and the volcano roll) and the chicken yakitori. They were all good, no complaints there. Beer was cheap too. We all enjoyed our time there. They also have outdoor seating, but we opted for inside and got a big round table in the middle of the restaurant - not complaining.   Does it cost to order extra wasabi? I was confused."}
{"text":"Middle-of-the-road sushi joint.  I'd recommend going here during happy hour so you can get decent prices.  Service was very friendly and helpful despite what many others have said."}
{"text":"This is the one of the first sushi places I've been to in Tempe & I can say that I left knowing I wouldn't return. The sushi and chicken yakitori I ordered were good but the service was anything but that. The host didn't acknowledge my group for at least five minutes. We were seated at the patio upon request but were left out there isolated from any type of service. Our waiter would disappear & left us for 20 mins after giving our bill. Not to mention we had to wait 40 mins for three rolls of sushi. Womp, sushi 101 was a no go."}
{"text":"I know it' s  not the fanciest sushi, but it's really great for what it is! I've never had a bad roll, and there is always great service. Their prices are reasonable, and their happy hour prices are simply the BEST. I really like the atmosphere and I feel comfortable coming here all dressed up or in a tee and yoga pants. Definitely my pick for an early dinner or late lunch in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi out there but their happy hour is So good. It's just so great to see a happy hour price for. Every. Thing.   Their vegetarian rolls are so good and I'm not even vegetarian! Get the dessert rolls bc they're yummy if you have enough room for dessert!  Saki boobs are always a good choice on happy hour if you like those.   I gave a 4 star rating just because I feel like the service could be better. I've had a few rude servers but the one of the managers is my favorite. I don't remember his name but he always makes up for the poor service from other people! And he recommends good rolls and different ways to change them up!"}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place ever since moving to Tempe, but only because I didn't know any better. The happy hour is disappointing, as it only cuts literally one dollar from the regular prices. Kind of a joke.. It was always a risk to go because the fish would only be fresh on some days.  Overall, an overpriced place with okay sushi. Not horrible, but we've found better prices with MUCH fresher sushi elsewhere. Please improve your happyhour if you would like to keep/gain customers."}
{"text":"We only went to this restaurant because it was late and we were hungry and had to settle for something. The rolls were okay - not fantastic and I'd definitely had better. Even the edamame wasn't done that well, only some of it was salted and the rest of it was bland. Luckily we went during happy hour and the prices were a little cheaper. I wouldn't really go back, though."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in college. We came here ALL the time. The staff was always friendly, good service, and the sushi is so good and cheap. The tofu steak is great to start with, and if you're going to skip sushi  for your meal, definitely go for the Nabe yaki udon or the miso salmon (both come with a ton of food). ALL of the 101 specials are good options, namely the vegas roll and the krazy maki. And of course sake bombs!! YUM!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but seriously? You're going to have kids learn how to make sushi and send that to customers? It was horrible. Uneven pieces and falling apart--I paid for that. I can't believe I paid for that.   The miso was nasty as well. Too many onions and the seaweed used in the soup was nasty. I'm always up for miso soup, but I will never eat anything like what they put in front of me ever again.  Plus, the service sucked. I'm sorry that I came in a weird hour (right about 2:30 pm), but why take a table if you are not going to stay for them? I have to say though, that I am kind of grateful that we ended up with a different server. The second one was actually nice--but couldn't even pronounce the words correctly.   To top it off, they wear shirts that say \"Miso Hungry,\" but one guy was walking around without the \"ry\" attached so it stated, \"Miso Hung.\"   Yeah. I'm never going here ever again."}
{"text":"It may not have the fancy decor of RA or Zen 32 but Sushi 101 is a great cheap college hangout.  You can get $4.50 saki bombs during happy hour every day as well as half off assorted sushi.  Although it's not best sushi I've ever had it's well above similar places that compete for the budget sushi category.  You can easily stuff yourself for $10-$15.  Make sure to try the \"fantastic sauce\"!"}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is a great sushi option, location just off the Tempe campus of Arizona State University. With a great happy hour and lots of fun sushi options, this local watering hole is very popular among students and locals of Tempe. From traditional sushi to modern Americanized sushi, Sushi 101 will have something for everyone no matter what you're craving."}
{"text":"Every roll I ordered was delicious! I especially enjoyed the Lemon Head Roll and Cheetah Roll. I was also pleasantly surprised to see vegan options (while I am not a vegan, your girl does like eating vegan at times!) I ordered the Vegan Tuna and it was really good, I believe it was a seasoned red pepper on rice but delicious none the less. We were there celebrating a birthday and service was awesome, for your birthday you have the option of $10 gift card or a free dessert. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great service!  One of my favorite places to go with friends while in Tempe.   Try their:  Caterpillar Roll Vegas Roll Spicy Tuna Roll Vegetable Tempura  They have a GREAT happy hour and great regular hour pricing as well!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly not busy, yet overstaffed. Over priced items weren't anything amazing and service was very poor"}
{"text":"We came here tonight, waited 20 minutes for a server and left. They were not busy. No one even looked at us. No one brought water. The only plus was that they thanked us on the way out."}
{"text":"First time here. Saturday night and was actually not crowded at all. Got seated right away. Waitress was very very friendly and nice. The food was delivered quick and OMG was it good!! I will definitely come back again!!!  Love it!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for sashimi, nigiri, and maki (rolls) for the last seven years.  The quality of the service has varied over the years, but it's never been terrible and the quality of the fish is good with reasonable prices.   Their seaweed salad and miso soup are good, but the tempura is not as good as the Nagasaki grill."}
{"text":"Disappointed Miso soup was cold. Sashimi tasted old. Didn't even eat half of my order. SERVICE is really sweet, tho."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is hit or miss.  I've had really good meals and then I have had some not so fresh meals.  I keep going back because the Happy Hour is cheap, drinks and sushi.  Try the sweet potato roll."}
{"text":"I eat here from time to time when I am in Phoenix for business.  The sushi is ok.  I tend to be attracted to all-you-can-eat sushi and Sushi 101 is adequate for this specialty cuisine.  I usually sit at the bar.  The speed of service could be better as it always seems either the sushi chefs or the servers are complaining about working too many hours.  The variety on the all-you-can-eat menu is extensive enough for most nominal sushi-lovers."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! I have eaten here twice before and not really loved it, but third times the charm and I'm never going back! I have a spicy cali roll, that was fine. The monsoon roll was disgusting, the fish was tough and didn't taste good. The manager came over and did absolutely nothing. I work in a fish house with Grade A sushi, trust me the fish shouldn't feel like that. Also as a manger you should probably try and make the situation a little better than try and tell me the fish is suppose to be tough! If I would of eaten half the roll or even made a few pieces; but I had one, just one! The waitress barely checked on us and also blamed the bad roll on her being busy....horrible service and horrible sushi"}
{"text":"Sushi 101 was a 3 star experience. Certainly not bad, but nothing special at the same time! When we walked in, the host directed us to a table to sit but rather than walking us there with menus, he just pointed and brought us the menus a few minutes later. It didn't seem malicious or rude - but definitely was odd and didn't give me a great first impression on the place.  We started with the edamame. It was pretty good. When it came time to order our entrees I asked my server what veggies came with the teriyaki bowl (I'm kinda picky). She responded with: \"You know, just the basic ones\". Eeep... I don't like negative reviews - but that doesn't seem like an effective way to answer my question. The conversation continued and I never really got to the bottom of my question. At one point I asked if there were mushrooms in it and she said: \"I think you should be good. Why? Are you allergic?\" No, not allergic - but if I was I hope she would go get a solid answer for me! She was a nice girl, and not rude, but just like the host I thought this was an odd way to treat a customer.   When our food came out it looked really good! I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate. I thought it was yummy but there was a whole lot of sautéed cabbage in there and not a lot of chicken! I will come back here because the prices were fair and they also have good happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a waste of money!!!$$$ unfortunately there is so much tough competition for Sushi 101 around the valley. Also places with much better prices. My sushi was extremely over priced and I didn't even drink! Happy hour is meh. Most importantly the sushi was not made with quality ingredients. The sticky rice on the California roll was so sticky it was like glue. The ends of the Vegas roll were basically fried hokey pucks. The cream cheese disgusted me it was old and sour. Each component of the sushi must be flavorful fresh and balanced. I will not be back here!"}
{"text":"(I'm downgrading my rating to three stars this entry...) I enjoyed Thursdays' dinner so much, I came back the following night and ordered the miso soup and two rolls.  Even though I was hungry, I hardly touched the soup as I found it too salty.  Unless I'm craving for something warm and salty next time, I don't think I'll be having the soup again anytime soon, even if it is complimentary...  Tonight (Friday, 4/10), I tried two rolls off of the happy hour menu- the Philly roll and the Baked salmon roll.  Both were delightful, and I would certainly order them again!!  The Philly roll contains smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber.  The baked salmon roll consists of baked salmon, krabmeat, cucumber, and avocado, and rolled with crispy panko crumbs.  Mmm!!  I'm very happy with Sushi 101!  My only complaints are that 1.) on my last three visits, I noticed that the sushi (vinegared rice) isn't as tangy (?) or as texturally-satisfying as it used to be, and 2.) I'm afraid to sit anywhere but the sushi counter where I know I can get the best service from Tots [short for Tatsuya  (sp?)].  Tots usually works with two other chefs on each side of him (tonight there were four behind the counter).  The one to his left NEVER smiles; He actually looks like he despises working there.  I usually sit in front of Tots' section, but there wasn't any room there for me tonight, so I sat in front of the unsmiling, surly-looking chef, and not once did he even make eye contact with me.  Not even a hello to open up a dialogue or to even acknowledge my presence.  When I mentioned to him that I had a couple of rolls picked out (I was hoping he'd make eye contact so that I could tell him about my food allergy concerns), he just said, without looking at me, \"just put it there,\" and pointed to the counter ledge in front of him.  After the list had been sitting there while he was still busy making other rolls (and more orders were coming in with him taking those orders without looking at mine), I finally shouted out to Tots' if it would be best that I hand him my order since he already knew my food allergies.  The surly chef, without looking at me, took my order slip and handed it to Tots and told him to take it.  Very rude and unprofessional.  (I'm definitely going to have to speak to the owner/manager next time I go back.)   Don't know why Yelp won't let me update my reviews here, so that I can downgrade the rating to reflect the poor customer service skills of this particular chef.  Otherwise, I'm happy with a venue that is very accomodating to their guests who suffer from food allergies!  --- (Four-star rating for this entry...)  Thursday's (4/09) dinner consisted of miso soup (complimentary if sitting at the sushi counter) and veggie tempura ($3) off of the happy hour menu; the Lobster Dynamite off of the regular menu; and Thursday night's special, the Spiny Caterpillar.  I'm finding that the more I try their miso soup, the less I like it; Soup was very salty, and I probably left about 2/3 untouched.  Veggie tempura, which we specially ordered to consist only of zucchini and sweet potato was good, but the potato needs to be cooked a little longer.  The spider roll was OK, but it couldn't compete with the dinner special, the Spiny Caterpillar.  Usually consisting of soft-shelled crab, crabmeat, avocado, and cucumber rolled in rice wrapped with nori paper and then topped with unagi (eel), I ordered ours with asparagus and taking the place of avocado and cucumber.  The Lobster Dynamite was the hit of the night, however; the usual california roll (though ours had substitutions), rolled in crispy panko, then topped with baked lobster with spicy cream sauce!!  We savored every delicious morsel!!  As usual, I always forget to take pics when Mom is around, so forgive the pics included.  A couple of young men nearby had two identical dishes that looked so enticing that I had to be nosy and ask them what they were called.  One immediatly said \"Krazy Maki, and it is awesome!\"  Mom and I decided right then and there that we were going to order that the next time we came in."}
{"text":"I have been going for 8 years to this sushi place.  I now live in Laveen and drive to come out to this restaurant.  The happy hour is amazing, the quality of the sushi is pretty damn good and I love the rolls. Try the mochi if you haven't and the Las Vegas roll is my favorite, even if its fried and covered in cream cheese.   Just try to avoid going when the comedy club upstairs is having a show.  Zilch in terms of parking.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I found the sushi here to be mostly mediocre. The garden roll is pretty good, but takes a long time to make. Why I am writing here is this: I ordered an avocado roll. Pretty simple and standard, it's just sushi rice, avocado and nori. Well, I took one bite and thought, yuck. There was something wrong here. I took another bite and wondered if the avocado had gone off, even though it looked quite fresh. I summoned the waitress and told her that there was something quite unappetizing about the roll. She said ok and that she would take it off the bill.  Afer a minute, the manager came out with a piece of avocado on a plate, telling me to try it, saying how fresh it was. \"Nothing wrong! Nothing wrong!\" she said. At first I thought she was trying to reassure me that there was nothing to worry about as far as food-borne illness was concerned. I asked what was in it and she said \"avocado, rice, nori and vinegar.\" Vinegar? Ew. Who the heck puts vinegar in an avocado roll? I guess you don't learn that until Sushi 201?  At the end of the meal, the bill came and the avocado roll was still on it. I brought it to my waitress' attention and she said she talked to the manager and the manager refused to take it off because there was nothing wrong with it. I said, \"So you're going to charge me for food I did not eat?\" And she said, \"Yes, very sorry.\"  And I realized that was why the manager came out, to show me that it didn't matter whether I liked the food or not, since I ordered it, I was going to have to pay for it.  I left no tip and will never return."}
{"text":"I have just recently starting eating vegetarian & I was really craving sushi. & let me tell you the reviews are true that this is the place to go to for vegetarian sushi rolls. I had the sweet potato roll & it was amazing. My bf even loved it & he's not even a vegetarian. Well defiantly come back."}
{"text":"Used to come to this place for sushi a couple years back. Idk what seemed to have changed (management, quality of food), not sure but something has definitely changed for the worst. I decided to try it for the fourth time in the past two months, all trips were disappointing I must admit. Their quality of sushi, going straight down. This trip was my most recent one and will forever be my last.  I am a huge sashimi fan. I ordered my usual salmon sashimi, but when it came out not only were their pieces tiny for the high price, I even found some dark splotches on it. After looking at them I quickly lost my appetite.  Sorry to say I won't be coming back and will stray away anyone who attempts to. Wish I could say differently. Sad, this place used to be good."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place since 2009. It's by far our favorite sushi place in the valley. They have updated their menu over the last couple years but their happy hour is great and they have a large selection of rolls. Our favorites are: Lemon head, shrimp tempura, and Las Vegas (add jalapeño). Their weekly special rolls are also good and you have to start with the spicy garlic edamame. Servers are college students but we've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said...the food is good, the staff is friendly and courteous...the place is clean and its decent priced. ill be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming to 101 for 6 years and it's still my favorite sushi joint. Love their sushi selections and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Every ASU student knows Sushi 101 as it's pretty much the go-to for any student.    Sushi 101 is a cross between a nice Sushi place and casual one.  You can always count on good sushi and pretty decent service.  Sushi 101 has a happy hour and a reverse happy hour, if you are able to make it during those times you will be able to get full on a lot of sushi at a pretty decent price.  For me it's not a matter of if I'll be back, it's a matter of when I'll be back.    Return factor 100%"}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day.  This was not my 1st visit to Sushi 101, which is one reason we went there. The other reason is their fairly extensive menu of Vegan options, which is so appreciated.  Our waitress was a doll, very helpful and attentive. Granted we were the 1st ones there, but great service is a standard for this place. Food was great, beautifully served. Love the fresh wasabi! You have to try it. Reasonably priced for the quality. Clean, comfortable.  One of the best sushi spots in the Valley."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a nice Saturday Happy hour.... Saturday Happy hour made it all worthwhile.  and yes the happy hour was nicely priced. My server seemed a little forgetful, not bringing my beer glass, forgetting my sake, etc., but she was sweet. Sitting at the sushi bar was nice because I got to chat to the young japanese sushi chefs. Very pleasant conversation as I caught my buzz, I must say. I had just a basic albacore nigiri and a philly roll, nothing to write home about. Place seemed a bit crowded, probably for the football game, but after my bomber I was enjoying myself. Overall, the sushi ain't that wonderful, but its a fun place to catch a buzz and get some basics."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 was both a slight disappointment and a pleasant surprise. Lets start with this criticism sandwich with the tasty part, the $5 lunch special. For five bucks, I received a giant bento box filled with hot and fresh tempura veggies, a combination of thinly sliced beef and teriyaki chicken, a side salad with ginger dressing, miso soup, and a side of corn in a light soy dressing.  The tempura was top notch, crispy flakey batter and generously portioned. This was the best part of the box and and potentially worth $5 alone. I really felt like this was a steal to get all the classic japanese flavors for so little cash. The salad and corn were both fresh and well seasoned, but basic. I'll be back for their cooked items as long as they keep offering them at this price.  The downside was the sushi. The eel and avocado roll was stuffed with filler fake crab, and only the slightest bit of eel. What little eel made it in to the roll was fatty while the avocado was on the overly ripe side. This joint loves to put filler crab in a lot of their rolls so watch out. Spicy tuna was also underwhelming; not enough spice and the tuna was pulverized to a mushy texture. It was obviously overworked and was not pleasant. I prefer my \"spicy\" roll fish cut in to small cubes, and gently mixed with seasoning to preserve structural integrity and maximum flavor. The rice was also second rate, either there was not enough vinegar or a general lack of freshness. The sushi prices were reasonable, so I guess you get what you pay for,  Service was spot on, and our food came quick during a slow lunch hour. In a bizarre twist, they have an attractive wait staff and play Frank Sinatra. Check them out for their bento, and skip the sushi.  -3.5/5-"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a good atmosphere and there were alot to choose from. The prices are reasonable, more on the cheap side, and the food was very delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is my favorite place for Sushi I have so many good memories here with friends From sake bombs to rolls of sushi I always have a great time here My usual order consists of Rainbow Rolls, Cali Rolls, edamame, miso soup, and I just found a new favorite roll called the _____ Geisha roll... I came to a blank at the complete name but its the only one with Geisha in it :) I used to love the Golden State roll and I get it from time to time I think I love Sushi 101 based off of the great food, good drinks, and all of the memories my friends and I have had... This one time we had sake bombs, which were super cheap like 3-4 dollars... and our bill for 3 people was 130... We had to crawl out of the place  Haha  Ps I also love their shirts, next time you are there... giggle at the shirts...."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while. Love this place! Has a great menu of rolls you don't see other places. The staff is super friendly, the manager actually engaged in conversation with us. The sushi chefs make great food!"}
{"text":"Exactly what to expect when going to a sushi place near a college campus.   Average food, average service, rude employees, high prices.  I ordered a seaweed salad, medium sashimi combo, and an iced tea.  The salad was OK, nothing special, but the damn thing was $5.50.  The sashimi was mealy and soft.  For $20.00, I expect a lot more.   The sushi chefs are, without a question, the rudest ones I've ever experienced anywhere.  You shouldn't have children interfacing with the public, even if they can use a sushi knife."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.. Happy hour is the best.. Saki bombs!"}
{"text":"Nice server and cooks but the food was just awful.  The crab puffs had large chunks of raw onion and overpowering taste of garlic. Sushi was made like large burritos which was just not right. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I must say.. This place has the best happy our around!! Large 22 ounce Kirin with a small hot sake $5.50. Go on Mondays and they're only $3.75 all day!! Sushi is on point and well priced! My favorite is the Salmon Dynamite."}
{"text":"Yeah...no. Don't give me a roll with canned salmon and pass it off as \"baked salmon\".  It was gross, tasted old and bad fishy. I told the waitress I didn't like it. She was nice about it and took it off the bill. The sushi chef was somewhat nice, but kept telling me that that roll was the most popular. Really...people eat that crap? It tasted like butt. He asked me to put up my plate so he could take the rolls off. I'm wondering if they were recycled. It tasted like it was already made and sat in the fridge all day anyways, so who knows. The other roll I had was ok. It just didn't taste fresh. We'll see how fresh it was or wasn't tomorrow morning. If you know what I mean. ;o)"}
{"text":"Perhaps because this is close to ASU they think no one will notice the quality of sushi. Because students run in and out or do take out perhaps no one bothers to say anything. But the reality is for people that enjoy good fish, soft rice and dont mind spending the extra few $$ for quality this is not the place for you. I always think of this place as \"fast food sushi\"..It comes out fast but I ALWAYS feel something is either missing or wrong. If I am in the area and with friends and they want a low cost sushi experience I will go but then I do simple rolls that are harder to screw up. Not the worst, not the best..but maybe just right for the students that visit the most.  ps. I dont live close so I dont go for happy hour. This review is based on non happy hour service. From reviews it is clear they put a lot of effort into alcohol and happy hour. Perhaps after 2-3 drinks the fish tastes better or the price makes it worth while to come back."}
{"text":"I've driven by Sushi 101 many of times and never really had that urge to try it. My son and wife always has Japanese urges and we were in Tempe so what the heck.   I walked in and the place isn't too big or small. Nothing really stood out to me. The waitress was very good in greeting us and getting our drinks.   I ordered the Spicy Chicken Yaki Soba with skinny noodles. It had cabbage, carrots, chicken, and green onions. Not bad. It had a nice kick to it. Not overly spicy but probably just right. My daughter had the Chicken Yaki Soba and it was exactly like mine but without the spice. She really did like her dish and gobbled it up.   As for my son and wife, they got the Raman noodle soup. It had everything in it. Cabbage, carrots, fish cake, chicken. They both thought that it was way too salty. So they didn't like it at all. This is why I was struggling on rating this place. It's really a 3 1/2 star.   We got all of our food before our sushi. We got the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. I thought they were sort of small but were very good. Enjoyed them. Liked the idea of presenting the rolls on tea leaves. Nice.   Overall the service was good. She kept our water glasses filled and kept on checking on us. Food was good and so so (little to salty for our liking). So since my wife and son are the Japanese food lovers, not sure if we will be back again. We'll see. Again 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I've always been eerie of going to this spot due to its vicinity to ASU but my recent trips here haven't been all too bad-  The ASU roll in particular was a fav - nigiri was alright for AZ  Happy Hour prices look great but on second look are around the same ceiling as House Modern's which is better imo  Our waiter also was a superstar! (Dr. in Training you know who you are~)"}
{"text":"Had a great time my server was wonderful. Great outdoor patio for puppies. Happy hour had some really great deals!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, great food and you can't beat their reverse happy hour after 9pm!"}
{"text":"I love going to place, especially during happy hour.  My favorite rolls to get are the dragon roll, tempura shrimp roll, sweet potato roll and the calamari roll.  If Im craving sushi, this is my go to place.  I mainly come here for the sushi rolls and the edamames during happy hour :) The service is always great! oh and cannot forget the desserts, very tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm from California originally and I must say we have some really good, really well priced sushi there. When I came to Tempe I was looking for something similar and I found Sushi 101. Their sushi and other foods are very tasty and are always of good quality. Their yakitori and gyzo are delicious, as is the squid karrage, and my favorite sushi rolls are the shrimp tempura, sakura, and the spicy salmon.  However when eating there the tables and space alway seem a little cramped but the atmosphere is nice for a dinner with friends. Also, the food can be pricey unless you go during happy hour (4-7) during which the prices are way reasonable. They also have good drink specials which include $5 sake bombs (with a 22 oz Kirin) and some beers that are $2.50-$3. However, the service can be quite slow, I've gone a few times where each person was getting one roll at a time and all at different times, so some people were done with their whole meal before some people had even received their first roll (even though everyone ordered at the same time). Sometimes the service is really fast but you just never know how it's going to be."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night, place wasn't packed but was pretty busy. Didn't have to wait to be seated. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. When our waitress was busy with other tables, the guy who was working the bar came over and made sure our table was doing well and that our beverages were kept full throughout our time there.   I ordered the Lotus Roll, Baked Tofu Roll and the Gardenfire Roll.  The Lotus roll was the best of them all in my opinion, the mango is a fantastic addition.  The Gardenfire Roll was good, packed some good heat.  The Baked Tofu Roll was very bland compared to the other. Still good, but I love avocados and they make everything better to me anyways.   A bit pricey, but most places like this are. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi place in town, but the happy hour makes it all worthwhile.  The food is good.  Nothing mindblowing, but you can get a nice meal here.    Cheap beers, reasonable rolls, just okay service.  It is practically on campus, so if you are a grown up, it might not be the place for you.  I like it well enough to have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past five years.  I always visited at happy hour, and have never had a bad experience like other reviews mention.  At a middle of the road place like this, I stick to standards:  Yellowtail Rolls (spicy or not, you pick) Salmon rolls Shrimp tempura rolls  Why mess around with anything more complicated than that?"}
{"text":"Every time I have eaten here, it has either been during the lunch specials or during the start of happy hour. Of most of the sushi restaurants I have been to, this place has one of the best happy hours so you can afford to try new items without breaking the bank. I have always had the same server who was very kind and served us well, but most importantly, I have always felt comfortable. Whenever I go to a restaurant, I have realistic expectations of how quickly food should be prepared and served. Sometimes this restaurant can serve you your order within minutes, and sometimes it takes a little longer. However, I am always very patient and whenever I go out, I like to relax as part of the restaurant experience. Therefore, the inconsistent serving time has never been a problem for me. Sometimes the wait to be seated can be long, so make sure to check this place out during slower business hours."}
{"text":"Sushi didn't have much flavor and the servers were not attentive by any means. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money here."}
{"text":"The Good: During happy hour (which ends at 7pm) the prices on most sushi are quite reasonable for a restaurant so close to ASU. The quality of the dishes can vary, but I do consider their chefs experienced enough to take a first-time sushi diner here. The selection is reasonably good, though many of the unusual names will have guests double-checking the menu to see what's in an ASU roll or a Wildcat roll.  The Bad: Consistency is NOT common here. I've had evenings where I was promptly seated by a smiling waitress and served delicious sushi within 10 minutes of ordering. I've also been seated and had to ask for service after waiting 15 minutes for a server to stop at my table (during a moderately busy night). During non-happy hour service the menu is considerably overpriced given the quality of the food, service, and dining experience.  The Ugly: The waitstaff are 70% inexperienced while 30% actually know what they're doing. After a poor dining experience I asked the waiter if he could do something to help make it right and was initially given a surly response. He did not offer a solution so I suggested waiving the charge on my appetizer (given that I'd waited so long for service after being seated). The manager did waive my $4 chicken karaage which I felt was appropriate given the poor service and disappointing quality of said appetizer.   If you go:  Go during happy hour or prepare to be overcharged. I strongly recommend trying the seared salmon nigiri and the sweet potato roll. Of my several visits there those have been 2 stand-out experiences in a selection of good, but not great, sushi."}
{"text":"STK ninja of the culinary atmosphere.  I channeled my ki into this Tempe staple not long ago.  Breaking my solemn vegetarian vow I stormed in like a tsunami.  Of flying sharks.  In outer space.  Just kidding.  Items yelped about as they arrived to the battlefield.  Spicy Garlic Edamame (Profound) Not only is the pungent taste of garlic a wonderful beginning to any fight with hunger, igniting the nose and throat, but the olive oil served as an excellent messenger of the balanced spice mixture.  This plentiful bowl seemed to never end, which my kunoichi ladies would agree provided well needed umami nourishment.  Vegetarian to boot!  Pork Gyoza (Suuuu-weet) Parting is such suuuu-weet sorrow! We made the gyoza become invisible within 3 minutes.  Chicken Katsu (Crunchygood) Katsu in my native tongue is a word of onomatopoeia.  It is used in ancient ritual to help the speaker to acquire a state of enlightenment.  Which I feel we achieved after the first bites.  I had to spar to acquire three of the four end pieces, my personal favorites to dip in the sweet reddish-purple sauce that accompanied.  Rice and vegetables rounded this course up to awesome.    Monsoon Roll (Fresh) It is hard to not get what you want from the proprietors of this noble house.  We waded deeply into our appetizer and entree to be enticed by the sweet offerings of our first sushi roll.  The jalapenos, salmon, avocado, cucumber and yellowtail came and went like the monsoon season of my childhood.  5 ingredients and a sauce to top it equals sweet and simple success.  Chicken Yaki (Transcendent)  Noodles demonstrate synchronicity.  They flow around and with the chicken, ginger, broccoli and cabbage.  The warming sauce was sweet and folded its flavors well into the buckwheat soba noodle.  This plate reminded me of childhood in Osaka and storming castles in Edo.  Good times.  Grizzly Bear Roll (Savage)  Felt like the namesake bear, pawing the last pieces with my O-hashi/chopsticks. I begrudgingly find that it is good form to offer final pieces of a roll that you find most favorable.    Black and Yellow (Aggressive) With it's layered complexities, it was our dark horse.  This SeaBiscuit delivered! Crunch, spice, char, it was all right on target.  Crunch Lollipop (Legend...wait for it......dairy) An excellent ending to an epic culinary journey.  It was more like a sweet treat to put the exclamation mark on.  Served on a skewer with the accompanying sauce, I took my last breaths on the battlefield with this in hand...  Eliminate your insurrection known as hunger, at Sushi 101. CN"}
{"text":"I went to this place to kill some time one day and sat at the bar.  The ambiance is kind of \"dingy\" for a sushi bar, which for me is a real turn off.  When I am eating raw fish, I want the place to FEEL clean (and of course actually be clean as well).  I wasnt very impressed by the service the bartender provided either during what was a slow time of the day.  Overall, I would say you are better off hitting up some of the other nearby sushi place if you have the craving."}
{"text":"Been there previously and had their combination sushi platters which are a good deal, and padded out with salad, tempora, etc.  Been less and less happy with the place with each subsequent visit.  Way too many items have fake crabmeat (whitefish masquerading as \"krab\").  I despise fake food.  Leave it out altogether if the real thing is too expensive.  Last time had a rainbow roll and two pieces of tuna only.  W/ beverage, bill came to $18 which is expensive for what I got."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times with groups and have never been real happy with it. Service has been terrible every time--they forget to bring things out that I've asked for, fill my green tea up with black tea when it's halfway down, and pick the tip up while I'm still at the table. All that has happened to me multiple times there. Just negligence. None of it is that awful, but there are so many better places for sushi, so why bother with this place? Also, their rice is almost always too dry. They never taste fresh, don't have anything original, and the service is bad. Seriously--why bother. Go to kabuki, sushi time, or Sakana. Just a few options that are worlds better than this place and within 5 miles."}
{"text":"This is one of the only sushi bars I go to! First off the service is normally great, aside from the female bartender that has way to many tables to stay ahead. (She is very nice but needs help in the bar area) The sushi is amazing! The sushi chefs are very talkitive and friendly and happy hour is to die for! Down side...aside from the restaurant needing a 'hip' makeover I cant think of any! Go here if you want some great sushi! Manager is very nice!"}
{"text":"Had some calamari, the volcano roll, caterpillar roll, seaweed salad and chicken teriyaki bowl and everything was very good. I would definitely go back here again. Service was good and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"I love this place.  While I do not crave sushi as much as some (my girlfriend), when we are in the mood for it we head here.  There are great deals during happy hour and they have a great selection to choose from.  It has never been packed when we go which is nice because we can relax and enjoy the atmosphere.    We are always on the lookout for great sushi places but 101 is definitely a good default.  You can also sign up for emails on their website and they will send you coupons on occasion."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Sushi 101 with a few of my girl friends.  The server was nice and gave us the hour happy menu, two hours before it started.   I ordered the Salmon dynamite roll $8 and Squid salad for $4.50.   I expected the Salmon dynamite roll to have lots of salmon in it, but inside the roll was all crab imitation meat and a large amount on the top of the roll was also crab imitation meat with crumbs of crunchy salmon on the top.  The squid salad had a descent amount of seasoning on it. After I took two bites I noticed about a 2cm hair on one of the squid pieces. I mean I know it happens so I asked the server for another one. Keeping my fingers crossed that it didn't have more hair.   A few minutes later Natalie was eating her Las Vegas Roll and Lemon something roll, I noticed that the last piece of sushi had a piece of long hair on it. After that my appetite was lost.   We notified the server and she apologized. She said that the two dishes were made in different kitchens. Uhmm, maybe they should be wearing hair nets.   I still paid for my squid salad but she took the roll off Natalie's bill.   Yeah definitely not my choice to go for sushi now."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Sushi 101 for happy hour.  Where else can I get $2.50 well screwdrivers and a Philly Roll for $3.50?  And happy hour every day?  Yes please.  Is the sushi the best around? Nah.  Are their regular menu prices that great? Meh.  Is the service good?  Usually.  Am I in love with their happy hour? YES.  I love sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the guys making my yummy food.  They are always friendly and good for conversation.   I recently hosted a Meetup event here and everyone had a great time.  We had about 20 people on the patio.  Service was great and they were very accomodating.    I'm in love with the Godzilla Roll!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would! I've been coming here for 4 years and it's gone down hill slowly but surely. Today was utter disappointment.   They gave my food to a table that literally had just been seated with menus in hand and I had already waited 20 minutes for my food to come out since placing my order. Also my waitress didn't check on me during that 20 minute time span. How do you not notice that one of your tables doesn't have anything but water and chopsticks?!   I shouldn't have to get up and ask where my order is. Nor should I have to wait an additional 10 minutes for my food to be made after you realized you gave it to the wrong person. They didn't even know they screwed up until I said something.   Taking care of a $7 sushi bill (it was happy hour) isn't exactly that great of an apology. Never mind the amount of food you wasted and cost you just made for yourself. Not sure how that equals profits for you guys. The manager didn't quite seem to feel too bad about what happened. She seemed rehearsed as if this happens often for her. What I don't understand is how that happened because it wasn't busy at all when I got there. From now on I'll take my business else where.   Tip: Hire competent and attentive staff and managers so stupid mistakes like this don't cost you loyal customers."}
{"text":"I like Sushi 101 alot. They have an awesome HH with really cheap prices on all the rolls and drinks! I love the Sweet Potato Roll and the cucumber salad. It can get a little loud in there with all the college kids. You can't beat  the Sake Bombers for $5!!!"}
{"text":"For Arizona it was ok.  The menu was a little heavy on the fried rolls.  Waiter was very friendly.  The soy sauce dishes were the size of soup bowls and they gave us metal soup spoons with the miso - must be authentic Arizona sushi."}
{"text":"I love that they have a section of vegetarian rolls and a few fully cooked choices. I had the Sakura roll, sweet potato roll and tofu steak appetizer. I'm looking forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Sweet Potato Roll and Dragon Roll! They have pretty decent prices during happy hour. Service at the tables is sometimes slow.. I like to sit at the sushi counter. They usually have pretty interesting specialty rolls on the specials board. I've seen an ASU Roll and others that sounded cool.   Happy dining. Kampai!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good, but they took at least half an hour to serve us, and it wasn't even busy in the restaurant. The server also didn't listen to our accommodations we requested."}
{"text":"When a fellow vegan told me about all the vegan options here, I couldn't wait to check them out. We're not talking an avocado roll here or a tofu salad there. No, no. They offer a nice variety of vegan sushi rolls; 9 vegan rolls are featured on their menu. Vegan appetizers include spring rolls, tempura vegetables, and a few other options. If it's written in green, it's vegan. (Also, the eel sauce is vegan.)  The Springs Rolls were fried to a golden brown and were deliciously crunchy. Not all sauces are created equal, but I love their sweet and sour dipping sauce. The Veggie Tempura was ok.    My favorite roll is their Lotus Roll. Made with asparagus tempura, avocado, and mango (I omit the cucumbers), this is a tastebud tantalizing dish.   If you enjoy a little spice, try the Gardenfire Roll, which consists of jalapeño, peppers, & Sriracha. It is a hearty roll that is sure to light your fire!   I also got a side order of their fried rice (sans egg to make it vegan. Also note how the word \"egg\" is written in black, not green) and surprisingly, it was some of the best fried rice that I have ever had outside of my hometown. I was very impressed.   They have happy hour every day from 4pm-7pm, and from 9pm-close. Happy Hour prices for appetizers and sushi rolls are written in red on the menu, so there's no guesswork here."}
{"text":"The food is very average. There are a couple things I like, such as the crab rangoons, but for the most part the rolls are small, overpriced, and not amazing. They are open late and have happy hour which is nice. For me, I've had bad interactions with the staff that really has made me not want to eat here anymore. In particular, one time I told the manager my calamari was rubbery and inedible to which he said that \"each batch of calamari is different, some are tougher than others.\" The food is not great enough for me to overlook that kind of service, so I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting and it was our anniversary. We love sushi and was out in the Tempe area and was driving up University and spotted Sushi 101 and decided to go there. We tried what they called the Bob Marley roll it was delicious. The place was very chill, and staff was friendly and they were the ones who suggested we try those rolls. We really enjoyed our visit. They are now a top recommendation to anyone that' asks us about places to visit out here. Can't wait until the next time we are in the area to pay them a visit again. Oh and in terms of fresh sushi they score a 10! To not walk into the place and it has that fishy smell!! Loved the place!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and I always try to find the best place to satisfy my cravings for it. I tried this out and it was ok. The quality isn't exactly the best but it's fine. Speedy service, polite staff and sporty yet relax (the irony!) ambiance. As for the menu, I like their Shrimp Tempura, Salmon Dynamite, and Sake Sashimi.   Too bad I haven't tried their happy hour thing. Looking forward to it once I'm back in AZ."}
{"text":"The service here is hit or miss, I've been here multiple times and sometimes the service is slow or inattentive, so I'm basing my review just on my experience last night.   The server Illianna was awesome! Friendly, smiled, no drinks went empty, appetizer came out fast and hot, she checked on us a perfect amount of times, and items like extra sauce were not forgotten. Over all perfect service from her!   The spicy garlic edamame was delicious! Loved their seasoning.   My new favorite is their \"mango tango\" roll, I tend to order the same thing every time but I'm glad I got something different. The roll had mango and avocado on the outside and a small drop of hot sauce, I'm assuming Sriracha, inside was smoked salmon, cream cheese and I think one other ingredient. The mix of flavors was phenomenal. Highly recommend.   Awesome experience last night :)"}

He was approachable and recommend us some things to do and places to visit Definitely recommend this place and ask for Carter!"}
{"text":"First place where I was able to find some decent Ramen.  The environment of the restaurant was great,  made me feel welcomed and relaxed.  The place was clean,  staff were really polite.  Only thing I didn't like was the soy sauce,  way too salty.  Other than that the place was great"}
{"text":"I went here Saturday night for happy hour.... it was good, but not great. I had the gyoza, a small ginger salad, and a green roll (?). The gyoza were the typical frozen like gyoza.... they tasted fine, but nothing mind blowing. The salad was underdressed, but not bad. The roll was interesting, it had asparagus, avocado, pickled ginger, some other veggies, and had a green vinaigrette on top. I liked that it was vegetarian, and I thought it tasted alright, but not wonderful. It all was fairly cheap, however, so I would probably come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"I came into this place with no expectations whay so ever.  In terms of service, it was actually pretty good.  I usually ding resturaunts for bad service. But this isn't the case.  The food itself wasn't Tha great. My Fiancé and I started with the shrimp tempura appetizer. The shrimp itself were the smallest shrimp tempura I've ever seen. The sauce that was given to us to dip the tempura was not tempura dipping sauce. The sauce given to us was just watered down soy sauce. For my lunch entree I got the L12 special,  which was beef and chicken teriyaki with corn, miso soup and a salad. The salad was fine. But it it pretty much went downhill from there. The teriyaki sauce used to make the dish, did not taste like teriyaki sauce. It was overly salty and overpowered everything.  Teriyaki is supposed to be balanced of sweet and salty. This was just salt. My Fiancé was with me and she got the poke bowl. Which she said was very salty. I had a taste and it was even salter than my dish. The last thing I had was the miso soup. Which this was the one thing that was under seasoned. It was like a bowl of warm water with a hint of sea weed. In terms if food. This is probably one of the worse meals I've had in awhile. I'm giving them a 2 star, because the service wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Been here three times and always good.  Great ramen.  Close to ASU.  I recommend.   Go Devils!"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to sushi place since I moved to Tempe. The ordering system is a little tricky when you first go there (you have to mark your order on a card,) but the wait staff is always super personable and happy to help you out, as well as explain what is in some of the more obscure rolls.  I reccommend going during one of their happy hours (my personal favorite being the 9 PM - close) and getting a sake bomb--$5.50 for a huge bottle of Kirin and warm sake. And they don't yell at you if you do the obnoxious but fun pound-on-the-table sake bomb setup. If you are a semi-lightweight like me, that $5.50 will get you a great head start on your night out. During happy hour, you can easily get fed and drunk for about $20 a person, with leftovers to take home.  To be honest, I have only ever ordered sushi rolls and edamame here. All the specialty rolls are delicious and huge--don't be turned off by the price, they pile tons of crunchy and savory extras on top of many of their rolls. The wasabi and ginger are also perfect.  Atmosphere is good. Nice decor, and the music is generally something that suits my taste. Can get a bit loud, but what do you expect from a place that's right next to ASU? My only gripe about this place is that the patio is kind of loud because it faces the intersection, so I never sit out there."}
{"text":"Sushi 101 is a great place to go if you are in the mood for sushi and don't have a lot of money to spend. I have been here a couple of times and usually sit on the left side of the sushi bar. The chefs are very friendly and make really good rolls. The presentation of the rolls are great. Sushi 101 is very Americanized - so if you want to have dinner at a traditional sushi restaurant, this place may not be the best place to go. However, the sushi rolls taste delicious. My waitresses in the past have always been friendly to me. I would have to say though, that rest of the waiters and waitresses in the restuarant were not very professional and the service wasn't the best. On some occasions, my empty water cups did not get refilled at all. Overall, I have always enjoyed my food and would go back but the waiters and waitresses need more training."}
{"text":"I came here not really having much expectations. I just stopped in before going to a comedy show over at Tempe Improv. Thse service was fantastic and the food was great as well. I have only had sushi a few times and the waitress was really helpful and patient when it came to us trying to place an order. I would definitely return"}
{"text":"Being that it's downstairs from the Tempe Improv, I eat here a LOT. I usually get there during happy hour, which is really great if you love sushi and need to have at least 4 different kinds in front of you.  The staff is always friendly (and cute!) and ready to answer any questions about the menu. Our drinks were constantly filled throughout the meal, too. Everything came out pretty quickly (we waited less than ten minutes for food). It's Americanized sushi. Anyone who sees \"bar and grill\" should know that and not expect to be blown away. It's great food. It's fresh. There's a great variety. It's not Jiro making it."}
{"text":"i cannot get enough of this place!  the sushi is sooo good and the happy hour prices are insane! The heart attack roll and krazy maki are unique and sooo tasty.  The shirts the employees where are cute \"miso hungry\"  Give this place a try with happy hour everyday! see ya there :)"}
{"text":"This is an update to a really bad review I wrote a few years ago. I live near sushi 101 now and I have been here a couple of times for happy hour. Sushi is hit or miss. I think that with the happy hour prices you can get a pretty good deal on lunch. Their salmon nigiri is also really good (sometimes!) Just wanted to update my review since I think Sushi 101 deserves more stars than I initially gave."}
{"text":"The food is kind of ok, but the price is too high. Suggest to go on Sunday with \"all can eat\" which is limit 1 hour for 25/person."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! My bestie Monica just wrote a review but I must say something about this place! I left very unhappy. Liz, our waitress needs to chill and wait until the customers is ready to pay!! She kept coming over and over again to collect the check and we weren't even ready to hand it to her. She ignored us the whole time we were there but was quick to get that check paid. I felt so uncomfortable. The manager was awesome though but still not enough to get me back in that place. On to the next..."}
{"text":"Service at the bar was inattentive, our Edamame never showed up, sashimi was meh.  Beer was cold and good.  Biggest problem was the disgusting restroom.  For the novices out there, if the bathroom is dirty then be worried about the cleanliness of the kitchen.  If you can't take care of a public space for your customers then why would you take care of the place where food is prepared.  Will update if we get sick."}
{"text":"Their happy hour prices were decent, and the setting is nice. Sushi rolls were good, but just be aware when a roll says \"crunch\" roll, there's barely anything on there. We thought they gave us a normal Cali roll until we looked really close and noticed it was dusted with very tiny tempura flakes. Not what I expected, but still good food, just not really crunch rolls."}
{"text":"I like (don't love) sushi 101 for location and convenience. It beats out the nearby RA in the accessibility column since you don't have to deal with parking on Mill.   101 has a good happy hour and a solid selection of rolls to choose from. It's not too expensive but you get what you pay for. I find it to be somewhat bland at times.   That being said, it's perfect for the college aged to get together with a group friends for some affordable sushi. You can't beat that location if you are living near/on ASU campus.     Go Devils"}
{"text":"This place was a shocker. I suppose by now I have a certain level of expectation from mid-continental sushi and I'm ok with the quality in AZ despite the distance from aquatic life (Tempe Town Lake doesn't count). While my bar here isn't high, this place wasn't on my list of places to check out. Sushi 101 was a very pleasant surprise. Their menu is diverse enough to appeal to those that like crap in their rolls i.e. cream cheese, those that like the classics, and those that are willing to explore some kind of happiness in between - me.  First of all, I was so impressed that they have more than 1 boring veggie roll. Who on earth offers 4 veggie rolls? This pleases me so. I was even more excited that one of them comes with jalapenos on top - yum! Secondly, the Sun Devil Roll is edible bliss and makes me wish I could carry around that spicy taste in my mouth for days.  I've only ordered take-out so I can't really speak to the atmosphere, but I love sushi so much that the environment I eat it in doesn't matter compared to the taste. The people that work there are pretty cool and it's about 2 miles away from home. Is this the BEST sushi in AZ? Is it the cheapest? No and no. But tasty and convenient enough to make the speed dial."}
{"text":"I first came to Sushi 101 as a wide-eyed freshmen at ASU and have been back plenty of times since.  This is pretty much a staple place for all ASU students to go to since it's right across the street from campus.  Anyways, on with the review!  The decor and ambiance of the place is pretty chill.  The place is always busy and service is usually speedy.  Try the stuffed jalapenos; wash it down with lots of eel and salmon; get some different bites of tuna in between; order the obligatory ASU and Sun Devil Rolls; never EVER forget the soft shell crab; and once you've discreetly unbuttoned the top button of your skinny jeans and kicked your feet up into your friend's lap, splurge and get some tempura ice cream because let's face it:  There's always room for fried dessert.  While the quality isn't exactly the best and I wouldn't drive out of my way to stop in for a bite, I'll always have a soft spot for Sushi 101 and all the warm fuzzy [and drunken] memories attached to the place.    Also, they have a great Happy Hour menu worth checking out and their lunch specials are decent."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour. The  drinks and rolls are very inexpensive and are pretty good."}
{"text":"Easy to find. Ample parking. I can say that much about this place.   For me, it's not anything to write home about. In fact, why bother? Well, perhaps you want a pretty central area to meet friends for lunch or after work. Or maybe it's the middle of the weekend and your jonesin' for sushi. Then, go. But otherwise, don't. I mean, really, with a name like Sushi 101, you can expect it to cater to ASU kids and residents down the block. Hey, no biggie, right?  If I were you, I wouldn't bother, though.  Service is good, although during a lunch visit once, I felt almost hurried out the door when all I really wanted was to enjoy my hour break, settle back into the booth and savor each bite. Seems that was too much to ask, for the check came long before 1/2 my roll was eaten. To me, that reeks worse than rotten fish."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years now! They have the best sushi around. I would definitely recommend to someone wanted to find a good sushi restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour sushi prices I've seen.  They have happy hour that ends at 7pm, and then again starting at 9pm.  Sushi is very good. Never been sick here from it.   Been here over many years, would like to go more often but hard to find people.  Servers are often really good here."}
{"text":"Garrison is an absolute gentlemen and a very kind host.  Him and his staff are friendly, polite and very accommodating.  Last few times I've been there, Colton has been my server; words can't describe how incredibly exquisite his skills are as a very impressive server.  Not only does he bring a bright smile but also friendly and very superb personality with top-notch service that words simply cannot describe.  I highly recommend stopping by; let Colton suggest his favorite drink and appetizers, he always gets it just right."}
{"text":"I always go during happy hour (which they have every day) and the prices on rolls are pretty good, cheaper than other places I've been (Sushi Eye, Pan Asia etc). The yellowtail sashimi is good and I've liked all the rolls I've tried there except the baked salmon roll (which my husband loves) I usually get a philly roll, golden gate roll and the calimari roll. I won't say it's the best sushi I've ever had, but it's certainly not the worst.    The service is usually sub-par. ASU students who don't really care whether you've been waiting 15 min for a refill, but what can you expect?  Overall I would say it's worth it as long as you go during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food:  The grizzly roll was excellent and the garlic edamame was spicy and delicious.  The waitress brought out miso soup, wasabi and ginger right away.  If their other rolls are as good as this one, then there are about 5 or 6 more that I need to try.  Service:  No complaints.  The lady at front was super nice, the chef and I chatted a bit and the servers were attentive.  Perhaps it was because I went in the afternoon and not the busy time...?  Atmosphere:  A little dark, but it has the whole Japanese feel to it right down to the Lucky Cat at the bar.  Did not check the bathrooms...  Price:  Mid-range for a sushi joint.  It is also close to a college, so I am surprised that they do so well given that sushi is usually a more expensive meal for college kids.  Maybe they are all rich...  Overall:  If I am ever back in Tempe, I will stop by again.  Would love to try more and I am happy to see a good sushi place in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Tempe and absolutely my favorite sushi place here. The Cheetah roll is my favorite and, of course, the happy hour is fantastic. I can even get my friends and family who don't eat fish to come with me because of the happy hour."}
{"text":"We come here on Mondays all the time because they have saki bombs all night for $3.75 if you sit at the bar.  The service is always awesome. Chelsea is always super nice. Food is fast and cheap on happy hour."}
{"text":"Congratulations Sushi 101.  You are my first one star review.  I have high standards for this category and you get to go down in my Yelp history as breaking my 1 star cherry.   This is the WORST sushi I have ever had.  I would rather eat the stuff from Kyoto Bowl.  In fact, in comparison Kyoto bowl sounds rather delicious to me at the moment, that is if you didn't turn me off from sushi altogether.   Happy hour schmappy hour, I can't believe people pay to eat this crap.    On top of that the service was awful.  I had a beer and finished it not half way into my time there and was never asked if I wanted another.   After that I find on my bill they factored gratuity into my tip.  The only time I know this to be a common practice is for groups of 6 or more. There were five of us.  I think they have to build in the tip because they know they are awful and wouldn't make any money otherwise.  College kids, I know you don't have much money but trust me, there are plenty of decent or even great sushi places out there that offer amazing HH deals.   I cringe to think of how many kids will have their first sushi experience here and will never know how truly delicious and amazing sushi actually is."}
{"text":"Sushi 101! Back on the east coast, this was one of my fave sushi spots to hit. I found this one after a brutal MBA exam recently...I'd had nothing to eat all day (bad idea when you have a three-hour exam) and the Yelp app asked me if I wanted to check in at Sushi 101. Why, oh my goodness, I'd LOVE to check in at Sushi 101!   This was around 4 p.m. on Friday, and the place had a fair number of people in it for that time of day, although it wasn't crowded. Since I was alone the hostess seated me at the bar (which I love in a sushi restaurant). I chose the Monkey Brains and the Krazy Maki rolls. That's A LOT of sushi, m' friends. But I ate all of it (remember, I was dumb enough to take a grad school exam on an empty stomach).   Both of these happened to be deep fried, but they had cream cheese--which is my weakness when it comes to sushi. I would have liked to see more sushi rolls with cream cheese, but my guess is that could be added to any roll.   They have a regular menu which features appetizers, bento specials, soups and salads, other entrees, and noodles. But it's sushi for this chick...   This location is in the group of stores on the NEC of Rural and University Dr in Tempe, just south of the 202. The bar seating is nice. Check the board on the wall for daily specials, and hey--they also offer sushi-making classes!   Bonus: The receipts give you the tip calculations automatically, and they also say \"May the force be with you.\" I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"today I ordered pento box and they gave me DEEP FRIED SALMON!!, no grill as menu says, CORN!, yes corn in a Japanese dish, \"salad\", only very unexpensive lettuce and couple of gross veggies. Service, terrible and quality of food, grose, no to mention the smell in the restaurante. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with an excellent happy hour menu covering both sushi and appetizers."}
