{"text":"The coffee here is excellent, I had a latte with 4oz of milk and it was perfect. The ambience is good and it's a nice place to work. A real gem!"}
{"text":"Tasty americano! Not picky with coffee- dunkin is great. Coffee here is good and barista seems to know what she's doing. Like the reviews said, not pretentious at all and pretty comfortable environment. Looking at 2 big tables with 6 seats and about 2 smaller tables for 2-3 ppl. About 15-20 bar seats along the walls. Good addition to the neighborhood. Have a croissant while you're there."}
{"text":"Best coffee in town by far! We moved from Portland, Oregon where the coffee scene is competitive. This little shop could definitely keep up! They are true coffee purists so you are not going to get the extra sugar syrupy tastes that you get at other places. This is a must see in Champaign-Urbana!

Besides the taste, the staff is so friendly and welcoming and the vibe is lots of fun. They also have all of the Homer Sodas on display so kiddos love it too!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for a cortado and it was absolutely delicious and exquisitely made! Service was friendly and fast. Perfect spot to get a coffee if you find yourself in the campus/green st area."}
{"text":"Great coffee, good people, comfortable seating, great atmosphere...what more can you ask for? Although I think they should consider merging the coffee shop with the bike shop next door. Imagine, stationary-bike bean grinders...gold I tell ya, gold!"}
{"text":"Great donuts, good pour overs, and banging tunes are to be found at this place. The design is simple and sweet, and the walls are also dry erase which are great for creative minds. It's a great place to get work done, and there's a nice dog at the connected bike shop."}
{"text":"As my friend Jessica Bursztynsky says, you pay for the environment at Brewlab. Their coffee is good and their pastries look divine, but they are expensive. It is $5.47 for a small latte with almond milk (they didn't have any skim milk-- only whole, almond and soy). The tiny coffee shop has a lot of natural light coming through and some big tables that make it a great place for studying. If you want a to-go coffee, I'd recommend going to a different place, but if you're looking to sit/lounge/study/etc., get a drink for here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great fun space with GOOD Coffee and friendly service - I went during summer break, so I am sure its packed when classes start up. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Have gone twice now. Nice atmosphere, friendly baristas. Latte was average, but their pourover was very well done. One of the best coffee places in CU"}
{"text":"These people know their shit. Only ordered pour overs and drip so far, but I have complete confidence that they can pull shots and steam milk for a very real latte/cappuccino/cortado/macchiato. Please give them a shot (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"BrewLab is a really chill place to hang out, study, and drink some good coffee. The decor is modern and the seating is comfortable. BrewLab also offers classes on coffee-making which they advertise on their Facebook page. Overall, a great place to relax after classes and to get your work done."}
{"text":"Really neat, unique spot. Was excited to check it out. Came in on Black Friday, ordered 2 pour overs and the only girl working let us know numerous times that it would be a wait. We didn't mind. We're used to ordering pour overs. We ordered a 3rd pour over and it was very obvious that she wasn't thrilled that we didn't order something easier or quicker to make. We got the cold shoulder for the rest of our time there. Will come back next time we're in town. Kenya pour over was great but it was not a friendly exchange from the girl behind the counter."}
{"text":"New favorite coffee shop on campus! Service was great, and the interior is gorgeous. It has a clean, modern vibe and feels like a creative space, especially with the white board walls that are already filled with tons of quotes and drawings.

My friend got the mocha, which had the perfect amount of chocolate. I got the Ethiopian pour over, which had a really nice fruity taste. I cannot wait to try all of their pour over options, and I think they switch up the options regularly. Also everything was really reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"If you've been waiting for great coffee near UIUC campus, this is it.

Get the Ethiopian pour-over if you want something tasty and interesting. Get Honduras if you want something more like normal coffee. 

Also, the place is owned by a design company and definitely lives up to expectation in that regard."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Champaign. I usually order Americano and occasionally pour over. They do the pour over in the very professional way - have no complaint. However, I wish more employees at Brewlab know how to make Americano. The male employee who I assume to be the lead of the store is very professional. One time he noticed my slight reaction towards the too-watery coffee a other employee made and he asked me if I want another one. What a champ (and I'm sorry for being a sensitive customer!) If he is making the coffee, then you can just leave it to him for the perfect Americano. I'm only giving 4stars for this review because last month I ordered Americano, waited almost 10minutes though the line was not present, and a new employee basically gave me an espresso lol; I was bit disappointed but she seemed like a new part time so I guess it is okay! Everyone learns from a mistake."}
{"text":"So yummy! I had a tea last time and just got my first coffee drink here. I don't usually drink lattes cause I just like Americanos but I decided to try it out! Me and my bae had the Pumpkin Spice latte with almond milk. It was so good! It wasn't sweet at all and actually tasted like real pumpkin. The sauce does have evaporated milk so it's a little hard on my stomach but it was worth it. Next time I will try an Americano here :)"}
{"text":"Bit pricey but definitely worth it. Staff were extremely friendly & helpful and unpretentious (where I'm from, there are a lot of coffee snobs) especially for someone not from the U.S. In the month that I've been travelling, this is probably the best coffee I've had so far. I ordered a latte (I believe it was the espresso with 10oz of milk?) and got an extra shot on top. The beans had a breadth of flavour and really shone through! I then got an espresso with 2oz of milk? Something between a macchiato and a piccolo - it had just the right amount bitterness and sour, definitely not too overpowering.

Cute spot to just relax and chill out, the wifi is good and there are plenty of powerpoints! 

If you're a a student and you like coffee, make sure to sign up to their rewards program!"}
{"text":"Delicious and strong cold brew. Fun & calm atmosphere that picked up around 1:30pm. Close walk from campus and near a bunch of other stuff. Will definitely be spending a lot of time here this summer while I do research at the university!"}
