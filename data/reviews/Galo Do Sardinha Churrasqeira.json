{"text":"This place is GOD. I had some good rotisserie before and this place is at least the top two. I still can't decide whether this place is better or Rooster's on Ossington, but yeah, it's pretty damn good.  I had sole fillets w two sides: macaroni salad and Parisian potatoes, for $10. The fillet melts right in your mouth. The batter is very light and crispy. I don't know how to describe the texture, it just MELTS into this heavenly good.... Gahhhhh....!!!! The fish def beats Rooster's, the potatoes, on the other side, were a bit dry when I got it. I had some of my bf's food as well, and his rice is very tasty. Better than Rooster's as well.  I can't wait to try all the other menu at this place. Will be coming here a lot!!  The place is very clean and nice to dine in. The dining area maintained its cool despite the 30 degree weather outside. They have a good selection of dessert-- Portuguese bake goods (cakes, tarts), some European Pop (pineapple/passion fruit pop); I personally don't drink, but I know a lot of people will like this: a range of liquids including beer and some little bottles of hard liquor (or I think that's what it is).  Anyway, highly HIGHLY recommended!! I'll be taking and uploading pictures on my next visit :) which will be soon"}
{"text":"Best Churrasco chicken in the city! It is full of flavour and not dry like some of the other shops. This has become part of my weekly dinner rotation."}
{"text":"One of the most clean places that I ever sean! Good Portuguese grill chicken and food."}
{"text":"I don't find much difference between most of the chicken places in town (which I'm sure is deeply offensive to all the devotees), but we did really enjoy Paul Sardinha's chicken. Yummy salty skin, juicy chicken, delicious hot sauce and above average green salad. Rice was also delicious - potatoes were standard. Extra points for having custard tarts from Dolce Minho.   Fast, friendly service. Bright and clean. Parking sucks but it's oakwood. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I was craving Portuguese chicken and was not disappointed! They have a clean, organized space. I was served quickly and the food was excellent! Great value for the price."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Portuguese restaurant I've ever been to. Would have preferred Swiss chalet. lol.  We ordered the chicken plate (cold and dry shitty rice and frozen veg). Then I saw the cod. I said is that cod. Yes its cod was told . Covered in red peppers looks wonderful but it's overcooked and dry and flavourless.  I started to eat it and said to the annoying owner that is in ur face telling u about condos he owns at Yonge and egg and the $2k on orders for his crappy food and hovers over ur table like a bug, Like I care about his crown of glory while I try to eat lunch on a snowy New Year's Eve   \"Is this salt cod ?\"   He was in My face asshole telling me that if u order cod at a Portuguese restaurant it's always salt cod?  Well in Newfoundland if u order cod it's either fresh or salted and they let u know.  So then he yells to kid in kitchen bring the other fish I think it was a Seabass, full fish head on.  Overcooked sitting on steam table with overpowering raw garlic. Terrible. We don't complain and get take out container. Get charged $45 for shitty food.  My husband puts out his hand for a shake and says happy new year and the pontificating jerk says \" ya\". Stay far away.  Shitty food.  Rude staff overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken around, and far friendlier service than costa verde across the street.  It's not gourmet, but for $20 you get a whole chicken and solid sides. Chicken is roasted perfectly with nice seasoning, potatoes fresh and soft inside, and the rice is just salty enough. Good hot sauce and custard tarts at the check out.  Very happy to see them doing well. We are moving from the neighbourhood but wish them well."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular of their location on College street when I lived a scant 10 houses away. Now I'm delighted to see them just a few blocks away from my new place! We came here last week and they were PACKED at 6pm. We called ahead, which may have made it faster. We ordered a family deal (1 whole bbq chicken, 1 big container of rice, 1 big container of potato balls) and 1 bbq chicken sandwich. The total was $25. The Hubster blanched at the cost, until he saw the sheer amount of food we got. The chicken lasted 2 meals and the rice and potatoes lasted the rest of the week.   Everything was just as tasty as I remember. The BBQ chicken was a tiny bit dry in areas (the white meat) but perfectly cooked in others. The hot sauce was actually quite hot!  I can't wait to try them out their rotisserie chicken.  There's a bit of seating, though most people do takeout. It should be noted that they serve wine and beer, which makes this a great place for a cheap date."}
{"text":"Thus us definitely the best churrasqueira in the city. Unfortunately Rooster had to split off from the mother ship as Rooster for sometime has been horrible. We now exclusively take out from Sardinia. Obviously their chicken is a must as it is extremely flavourful yet moist. Their potato balls are delicious as they season them, so ketchup is optional. Lastly, their rice. If you're not a starch fan, you need to make this one exception as it is beyond what words can aptly describe. A well deserved 5-stars!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the restaurant amazing. The only bad thing is the lack of parking."}
{"text":"I come here often for a quick dinner pickup. A whole rotisserie chicken with side of potatoes and rice is under $20 so it's a great deal when you want to feed a family. the Portuguese style rotisserie chicken is good but I had better ones and the sides are fresh and always served in big portions."}
{"text":"I went there with friends and the food is ok nothing special the service is fair enough."}
{"text":"Was tired of the disappointing chicken from costa verde across the street and was delighted that some competition was entering the Oakwood village.  They did not disappoint! I tried a whole rotisserie with their baked, not fried, potatoes and it was moist, juicy and flavorful.  Next time I was buying for seven hungry family members so Joe suggested the $35 deal and what a deal it was! Three chickens, a container of rice, and a container of those delicious baked potatoes. Let's just say that no one was hungry afterwards and they're were little leftovers as it was so yummy we didn't leave any. The place was spotless too.  They also have freshly prepared soup daily for $3 which I often get for lunch.  Glad they're in the hood."}
{"text":"Great little chicken spot. Ordered the half chicken with 2 sides for $10. Chicken was fall of the bone and the quality of the meat was excellent. Potatoes were perfectly cooked and delicious. Steamed veggies were previously frozen which I didn't find particularly appetizing. If I were them, I'd switch to fresh steamed veggies.   All in all good bang for buck!"}
{"text":"I get dinner here for my family at least once a month. Can't go wrong with the family value meal, a rotisserie chicken with 2 sides. The chicken is super tasty, nice and juicy with a spicy sauce. You also get pretty good sized portions of the side dishes. My favourite is the rice and the potato balls, the steamed veggies are just ok."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after having Costa Verde across the street on Tuesday and it was horrible so I order a grilled chicken and they give me rotisserie the potatoes are dry the rice is bland horrible horrible horrible!! Where to find a decent Portuguese place to eat?"}
{"text":"Cheap chicken dinners are the way to my stomach. Came here on a recommendation and it did not disappoint. The chicken was tender and moist. There are a lot of sides to choose from. Ended up with potato balls and a salad. I love the potatoes. Well seasoned and cooked through. We also tried the calamari which they personally make. It was so good! They don't make this all the time however so we got lucky. Calamari was lightly dusted, not a lot of breading so you can really taste it. They also make they're own sauces. Some tables available for dining in but it's a bit cramped. More of a take out spot. The owners are very friendly and we ended up having a nice conversation. Would definitely visit again. Two dinners, drinks and an app cost about $30. Amazing."}
{"text":"Bought a whole chicken from here and it was delicious. It was sitting out on the counter when we ordered but it was steamy hot when the gentleman behind the counter cut into it so I assume it hadn't been there too long (it's been two days and so far, no signs of trouble). The potatoes are tasty, and while I still prefer the more tender potatoes at Costa Verde, the flavour of the chicken and the lemony hot sauce was enough to win me over. Also, the take out chicken comes in a styrofoam container here rather than a bag as it does across the street making it less messy to carry and easier to store for leftovers. I'm glad for a new addition to the neighbourhood! I'll be back for the $35 special as mentioned by a previous reviewer."}
