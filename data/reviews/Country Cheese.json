{"text":"I walked in to try fruity cheeses from shipped from abroad. I was thankful for the lady being welcoming and helped me even if she knew I was there to only try small samples of cheeses. I'm not a cheese snob but I'm tired of regular cheese from the grocery store.   Right away she knew I wanted to try Stilton Cheeses and when I told her I wanted fruity blue cheese, she had me try something from Montreal. She cut the piece of cheese for me and did her best to give me a perfect amount. She knew I was just expanding my knowledge in cheeses and was very enthusiastic about it. She didn't try to cut me a bigger slice than I wanted. It was as small as she can, as what I asked.   I had the Mango Ginger Stilton Cheese from UK(apparently a best seller) and I so recommend it. I want to come back for more. I paired this cheese with white wine (reisling) from Niagara and a simple toast with Avocado. It was perfect guys! The smell of the cheese is amazing, fruity and had a creamy smell.   The fruity blue cheese was also perfect. I had it a little later than when I bought it, I completely forgot. Thankfully it was wrapped and bagged well. I enjoyed this with the egg sandwich. Add bacon if desired. The smell wasn't pungent but was definitely in the cheesy side.   Parking here is not too hectic, it's situated in a plaza near the 401 Salem exit. I didn't find the cheese expensive, I thought the prices were practical. For Antipasto for 50 people it's easy to spend about $100 for the cheese.   There are a few tables and not too many seating. The lighting is okay, it's not bright in there. I was also told that they cater to events, and i find their prep area (behind the counter) clean and organized.   When you buy a piece of cheese, there will be a sticker, to make it easy to remember. On the sticker it has the name of cheese, where it's from, and the price. I remember a brief description included as well.   I like how the cheese I got didn't have the wax part that came with. At some stores they also count the wax to weigh. I'm not sure if it had a wax case and if she took it off before weighing it. But I was pretty happy with it over all, if I were to buy a big piece.   They sell good variety of cheeses, a good alternative when you're not down town Toronto (Kensington Market).  You can also ask them for pairings. They are knowledgeable. They can tell you what wine to pair with it best.   I would come back here again."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cheese shop! The girl behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. In addition to the huge variety of cheeses they carry, they also have exclusive cheeses such as their cajun spice covered cheddar and an amazing ice wine soaked blue cheese. A great place to try something new. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"solid little source for a rather decent offering of cheeses in the GTA. considering the size of the shop i was quite impressed with the amount of variety they had. the owner & staff were happy to make recommendations and offer samples to get you what you're looking for.   they also offer paninis made to order (you pick the bread/spread/cheese), for $7.99 - didn't give it a try this time around but the options all sounded delicious. additional $2 for capicollo.  there's a smattering of goods around the store to go with the cheese as well - crackers, cured meats, jams -- easy one stop shop, minus the wine ;)"}
{"text":"Being lactose intolerant and going into a cheese shop is a bit of a death wish. However, walking into Country Cheese Company was far from it. Yes, they have an amazing assortment of cow's milk cheeses but the variety they have for those like me was amazing and exciting.  Imagine being able to have cheese again that's not fake!  Not only were there lactose free options but also sheep and goat's milk. I had NO idea that sheep and goat cheeses could have so much flavour! The staff are fantastic with suggesting types and figuring out how much you really need.   I walked out with the Honey Bee Goat Gouda which is hands down the best cheese I have ever had, a goat blue cheese, a lactose free olive and tomato and a pecorino.  If I could have dairy I would have loved to try the Sticky Toffee Cheese it just sounds outstanding.   You'll love your experience here."}
{"text":"Going into Country Cheese Company is always a fun experience. Tammy (the owner) is so lovely and always has something new to try.    Such a great asset to the durham region!"}
{"text":"Very extensive range of cheeses to cater to any pallet topped off with excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Sweet find local artisan cheese in Ajax !!   I saw this place right next to the 401 so I had no choice but to stop. Found some great Ashley Goat and Comfort Cream (maple smoked) both recommended for the venue - went over extremely well at the wine party,,   Tammy the proprietor was very knowledgeable and helpful....  We will be back !!!  Thank You CCC.."}
{"text":"Great little store with amazing service. You definitely get what you pay for here. There are lots of wonderful specialty cheeses to try and to buy. They are not cheap but the prices are fair. I definitely recommend it for any cheese connossoir out there."}
{"text":"Stopped by to see what this place is... and bought a couple packages of cheese.  Definitely a cheese specialty shop.   The owner was very patient and informative and offered samples of any cheese there.   I learned about how much I don't know about cheese!  Impressive variety and they have sandwiches, too."}
{"text":"We won a gift card for this store, and for some time meant to try it, but kept putting it off. That was our mistake, because once we entered this store we fell in love with the it. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, and were wonderful in interacting with my children. The range of cheese is fantastic, and we were told that they can order in special cheeses if they didn't have in stock what you're looking for. I particularly love the rosemary and olive oil cheddar and the smoked applewood cheddar has to be one of the best I've tried in a long time.  Although not the biggest of premises, there is a little seating area inside where you can savour freshly made paninis and tea/coffee.  Although I do love this store, it only gets a 4* rating because of the prices. I get that many of the cheeses are imported and the expense that goes with that, but even so it is expensive for the size of the cheese you get."}
