{"text":"We are new to Cleveland and decided to check downtown. On our way back to our car we saw Harry Buffalo and saw the sign come on in for a drink. We did just that. The pub is airy and nice. We headed straight to the bar, thirsty for that drink. We sat and sat but noone seemed to notice us. If the bar was crowded we would have understood but the bar had myself and my husband on one side and another set on the other side. Three or four other tables were taken by other customers on the tables surrounding the bar and that was it. A bartender came close to us and left. No acknowledgement. She came back and started wiping the bar surface. Never at any point paid us a glance. Two servers, a male and a female were at the POS terminal. They stood there all the while. Mind you they were facing us. Two other servers walked past us to help a table right on our left side. They walked right past us. One of those ladies came back to the table again and left again without even looking our way. We just realized the \"come in for a drink\" sign at the door must have been for other people and not us. There is a big green board with \"rate us on yelp\". Well that's exactly what we are doing on our drive back home on my cell before we forget details.\"Completely ignored customers\" should be our heading. We are African American. Where we ignored because of that? We never look at life like that but treatment like this can make a person start having these questions, especially because we were the only African Americans in the pub at that time. I see reviews from different people here so that must not be so. We would like to take the mindset that it is just very POOR service around 3:30pm on Friday June 14th. Maybe someone from Harry Buffalo can explain to us or future customers what just happened. We left the pub with not one single \"hello,  we will be right back\"."}
{"text":"Attended a fundraiser here and thought it was great and well put together so when we needed to have a fundraiser, we looked into Harry Buffalo. Filled out the online form and called the restaurant. Never heard back. Apparently you have to have connections or know someone for them to do this for you, even though they offer and advertise it on their website. Pretty annoying considering they were the only bar in the area with our date open."}
{"text":"Great service by Jillian
 That's what you look for with customer service!  Sweet potato fries were awesome  and great daily specials"}
{"text":"Traveling alone, staying in a hotel near the mall and decided to try out the Harry Buffalo.  As I generally do when I'm dining alone, I sat at the bar for lunch. It was a late lunch (2pm ish) and not a lot of people dinning there at that time. I seated myself and at least 10 minutes passed before the bartender even noticed that I was sitting there, right in the middle of the bar. I asked for a menu and chose the buffalo burger with Mac n cheese.. Unfortunately it took another 10 minutes for the bar tender to come back for my food order.  The burger was 'ok'.. Definitely seemed like instant Mac and cheese (shells) on the burger that slid right off when I picked it up.  The fries were soggy and the beer tasted flat. 

The restaurant has potential, but I was rather disappointed with it."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time, waited very long with another family so someone can greet us to sit. After was seated, waited 20 minutes & no one showed up to take our order. Talked to the manager, then he came and started taking the order. Very low knowledge about the menu items and options. While ordering, a spider fell on our table & the manager smashed it with the menu !!!!! Took our order, I am writing the review now and it has been 28 minutes since we ordered, no order showed up. Ppl behind us have been waiting for longer than us. Bottom line, avoid the place. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was minimal. The waitress had a few customers and was doing a favor providing service. She worked on her laptop and from time to time looked around."}
{"text":"We visit this location every weekend, sometimes twice. Matt is the bartender at the outside bar and is the reason we keep going back. The food is pretty good and they have Stella on tap, which is a win-win for me. Prime Rib on Saturday is a favorite, served with a ridiculously large baked potato and a nice salad. Lots of TV's to watch the games, nice people to chat with and a Touch Tunes Jukebox I can play with my iPhone App."}
{"text":"Dirty table, dirty floors, dirty restroom, no soap in the men's room.  I really hope the employees carry hand sanitizer.  Service was slow food was so, so."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean good menu but the service was terrible.  Waited forever to get order taken, poor follow up on if we wanted refills etc. There was one other table of people there besides us too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice while traveling for work. Had a burger that wasn't too tasty the first time I was here, and completely disappointed by the wings on the second visit. I don't need a third strike to know I won't be back if I'm ever in town again. The service was decent and the prices are ok, but if you like food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got the ribeye steak, it was awful. It was pan fried, had no seasoning and I got a few bites that actually tasted a little spoiled. It came with a baked potato and mixed seasonal veggies, which were fine. My husband got the Cleveland Cheesesteak sandwich with tortilla chips. He said the sandwich was OK, he thought it was a little small, but the tortilla chips were very bland. He also got a beer on tap, which was flat. The waitress brought him another one, but it was the same. Our waitress was super friendly, the inside of the restaurant is very airy and comfortable."}
{"text":"Once again..the Food was Fabulous. Everytime I come to Cleveland I have to come here. The Rib Eye Steak was Fabulous ..the server was pleasant and very accommodating !"}
{"text":"It's always a good time to go and spend time with friends and family. Therr is always something going on, with games on and or entainment of some sort. The bands on friday get the coutomers engaged and having fun. The food is always amazing and comes out delicious. The service is always the best, the girls always have a smile on their face. Their very personable and outgoing. The patio is the best for summer time."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a week 2 years ago for software training, and I'm glad I got to visit this place. I had the Bison burger with their homemade potato chips, and of course a couple of cold ones. This could be the best burger I've ever tried; truly delicious! It's kind of sad, but this was kind of my highlight of that week.;)"}
{"text":"5:00 pm on Friday before the Indians game. Full house. Garage door Windows all the way around the place. Beautiful day outside. Management has the Windows all closed because \"the air conditioning is on\".

Just about as dumb as you can get.

~~~

Edit after the response of the restaurant's manager:

First, it is good to know that management is reading these reviews (and responding). I hope it makes for a better experience for diners.

It is difficult, at best, to figure out how closing the windows on a nice day solves a problem with the air conditioning. Speaking without hyperbole, it was at least as nice outside the restaurant as it was inside.

And sitting on the other side of the bar, which was open, is a magnificent idea. Too bad that we were first told that \"it wasn't open yet\" and the hostess offered to let us know when it was while we waited at the bar, which we did. Eventually, we gave up and moved to a table so we could eat after again being told it wasn't open. Minutes later, we watched dozens of people move to the cool, comfortable and enjoyable side of the restaurant while we waited for our food. No hostess or wait staff offered to help us move. We were certainly past the point of caring by then.

There were four \"hostesses\" and clearly not one had a clue.

It's not a horrible place by any stretch (my hamburger was very good) but this kind of silliness is a turnoff."}
{"text":"Okay, the Miller lite blew and we had to wait upwards of 4 minutes.  Overall, not bad, but not great. I like a quick response personally.  If you're the same, this place is not for you. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here after catching a Lake Erie Monster hockey game.  Walked right in and sat down immediately.  Service was very quick, even though they were packed.  
Ordered the Black Bean burger on a pretzel roll and a Bison burger on a wheat roll.  Black bean burger came with green peppers and , a nice change from the typical veggie burger and very tasty.  Accordding to my husband the Bison burger was very good, although it didn't taste much different from a good beef burger. Skin on fries were fresh and just crispy enough, even when we doused them with tabasco.

Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been stopping here for drinks and food since the place opened. Last Friday we stopped for a beer on our way home. The atmosphere was lively, and there was a decent country singer performing live. 

We had one drink apiece and closed out our tab. I left a tip on my credit card. Today, when the transaction cleared the bank, I found that someone took it upon themselves to alter the tip amount to receive a larger tip. 

I don't plan to dispute it with the bank, as it was only a few dollars. What I will do, however, is take my business elsewhere. If the servers are willing to steal from me, then they are willing to steal from their other customers as well. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Don't go in the evening or anything other than bar service can be an afterthought.  
Been some during the day and it was fine, but went with my wife for dinner a while back and she ordered the prime rip special, which was overcooked, cold, fatty, they forgot one of the sides, and were rude.  Only the baked potato, which was lacking the accompaniments, was edible for her.  I tried it and agreed.
Also, how do you not have horseradish sauce with prime rib.  I'm reluctantly giving it 3 stars instead of two because they have been relatively acceptable during lunch.  Dinner service was a joke though."}
{"text":"This place was awesome~!

We've been eating at this place every other week.

First of all, services are nice. Servers are always polite and promptly.
Secondly, beers are good and cheap, can't beat a $6 pitcher of Coors Lights.
More over, food are yummy, I like the way that you can upgrade your side, for about $3 more, you can have 5 more wings, or BBQ ribs, can't beat that.

Good place to hang out with your friends or family."}
{"text":"Been living downtown for the last decade at this place has always been on point. Food is great, service is great.  Just hit the place up on a Tribe gameday and it has everything I want in a bar. Our server today (Kelly) was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  The food is great!  Just be careful running a tab.   I went there for lunch and my card was over charged.  I get it, mistakes happen and our bartender/ server had a great attitude and had our food out fast!   I called as soon as it cleared in my bank account and the manager was super nice and told me to stop by to give me the amount that was over charged.  However, when I came back to get the money, the server that handed me my money back (which was not the one that waited on us)  had the worst attitude and told me maybe I did my math wrong.  The last thing I need is a bad attitude after I'm the one who is not responsible for the mistake.  With that said, I'd go there for the food and most of the time the service is good...  Just pay cash for your meal."}
{"text":"Hate this place lol. If you like hanging out in dirty frat houses though, you'll love it. This bar is very \"cliquey\" , poor set up- nowhere to stand & gets way too obnoxious on the weekends. Bartenders SUCK - takes forever to be served & they don't know how to make anything."}
{"text":"Our waitress Lauren was great burgers are excellent can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu can't go wrong with the pretzel bun"}
{"text":"After previously less than satisfactory experience, I spoke with Rachel, the manager and she was very helpful. I went back and the service was back to excellent.  An organization often defines itself in its response to a problem, and this one did awesome."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are from out of state, and we chose to eat here. We made a great choice! The food was delicious, and the waiter was outgoing and friendly! We had buffalo chicken Mac n cheese, loaded fries and buffalo Mac bison burger. We both enjoyed our food! Warning: Don't get the buffalo Mac n cheese bison burger unless you like spicy food! (Which I do, so I loved it.)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE BUFF!  The staff always is warm and friendly and ive always had awesome service!  The menu is perfect if you wanna be healthy or if you have gluten allergies like myself.  Its not your typical bar food and I love the healthier choices they have including the gluten free options clearly marked on the menu. Its also a great place to have parties or corporate events because the basement is a perfect spot for local gatherings. If your looking for bad service and greasy food this isn't the place but if you want a great meal and a good time then the buff is the best bar in lakewood."}
{"text":"Some of their dishes are ok, I haven't found anything that really moves me. Most of it is bland, your best bet for something good is to order a few app's instead of a meal. The big drawback to this place and I'm not kidding, is that EVERYTIME I've been in lately (I come to the area for business) there's a skunky MJ odor, which is ok I guess, but what about the kids? I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices for wide variety and pretty good food.
Pretty good food for reasonable prices. Great for before or during a game near the arena."}
{"text":"The food was pretty darn good, for the most part. The wings were quite good and so was our appetizer. However, the fries were seasoned with something...sweet. I really didnt enjoy them. The service was decent but not particularly friendly. The atmosphere was unusual and the tables next to us were obnoxious, but that was out of anyone's control. I was pretty underwhelmed by the restaurant, but if you go, get wings!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, good staff and a great neighborhood joint!! Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"Food and service has gone down hill. I will not go there anymore or recommend to others. Many people are unhappy with the service and food quality."}
{"text":"Very very forgettable. 

Food is mediocre and the lone IPA they had (when I went) was like $7. Nah. 
I've never been here when the fratty/ex-high school athlete crowd is here, but as a former local from literally a block away i walked past many times when a game or the NFL draft or something similarly sport-esque was on. Emphasis on \"walked past.\"

You can do better in Lakewood for food or drinks or ambiance or really anything."}
{"text":"I received a gift card to this place and after finding out the Akron restaurant had closed, drug me and my girlfriend up to Cleveland to have it. $5 dollars for 'event' parking even though I wasn't sure what kind of event was going on and still don't have a clue. Walked in and saw 'please seat yourself', and we did, 10 minutes pass and no one to chime. I should probably mention this was a Saturday night, no local games, about 4 people in bar. Other guests around us were also clueless as to what is going on.

The table was sticky, the enviroment seemed to be of Applebees but more dingy. Imagine the bartender lathering the place in sulky pale beer then flipping the open sign.

The service was questionable, we had 3 servers none of which knew exactly what was going on.

The food was pure novelty; having eaten buffalo burger elsewhere (and may I say was alot better) I ordered 'how the bufallo eat them' which is a blue cheese contraption of deafening sweltering of blue cheese all over your poor rather tasteless buffalo patty.
I won't make that mistake again.

As a bar for games or whatever it probably is more tolerable as you'd probably be drunk off your face and you'd probably beckon at the sight of food. But on a Saturday night? Surrounded by kids screaming wailing and an enviroment that can be had at any local joint. Find somewhere else."}
{"text":"There is a Tradition of deplorable here. The service flat out blows. The staff is lazy, unattentive and ignorant about specials or lack there of. Turnover is horrendous. The only consistent employee is Darnell from the kitchen. He's a great asset and fantastic staffer. Had not Cleats imploded, he would have still been cooking there. There are dive bars better than this place. I give Crystal Keg in N Royalton and Lucky T's in Parma a higher grade. They also blow during football season and one struggles to get a game on beyond the Browns and Steelers. There realistically is no redeeming quality about this bar. Did I mention the restroom smells like a horse stable? First time back there in 2017. What a disaster. The George family really needs to clean house!! I get mistakes can be made but when, time and time again, there is a miscount of drinks on a customer's tab something smells. It hasn't happened just once or twice. There has been a repetitive pattern since this joint debuted as H Buffalo, transitioned to Knock Outs and reopened as H Buff a 2nd time. Btw, has it been mentioned that everything on the menu is grossly overpriced?!

In conclusion, based on the consistently horrible service, this bar should be boycotted! Do your due diligence America!!"}
{"text":"Good beer and atmosphere.  Had the carnitas tacos.  Pretty good.  Too much BBQ sauce.  But pizza looked good"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years,  usually once or twice a week, it seems that every time I go the service gets worse. In my most recent visit the service was awful. I waited almost an hour to get a food order taken, in the hour I waited my beer mug sat empty for almost half an hour( which is amazing considering I was sitting at the bar) . The bartender couldn't find time to help the 6 people at the bar including myself, but could find all the time in the world to talk with fellow employees and text on her phone. If I did my job as poorly as some of the people who work here I would imagine I would be fired. Regardless of years of patronage I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was in town overnight and this place was just down the road from our hotel.  Not as \"trendy\" as other downtown eateries but the food was great (had a $6.00 burger! Seriously where can u get a six dollar burger?) and some ice cold beers.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Get the buffalo burger!  The best burger I've eaten... Loved the atmosphere. My waiter was friendly and he always checked on us. Menu had many options. We got there before the herd of people came in and after we left it was packed. But I enjoyed my time here and will come back again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is nonexistent. If you want to eat somewhere where you truly feel like you are insignificant then this is your place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly there are a ton of gluten free options on the menu, including gluten free hamburger buns and gluten free pizza crusts. Why didn't I know about this place earlier?! Tonight's girls night out we sat out on the beautiful patio under a gazebo. I ordered the appetizer Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and replaced the pitas with veggies (I didn't even have to ask as it is suggested on the menu).  The hummus wasn't as great as Aladdins, but decent all the same. I would order it again. I also ordered the gluten free BBQ Chicken Pizza. I've had a variety of gluten free pizzas from restaurants in Cleveland and other cities, and I have to say that hands down, this was the best gluten free pizza crust I've ever had. The crust, while thin, was fully baked while still a maintaining a light consistency. In my experience, gluten free crusts are either raw/under baked, or cardboard, so I was super happy with the way my order came out. Our friendly waiter seemed confidently familiar with gluten free needs so I didn't feel like an idiot trying to explain that I would need my food prepared separately and in a clean environment. The service was fast and efficient. We never had to ask for refills for our drinks as our waiter was totally on top of it. I had a great time and will definitely try to work Harry Buffalo into our girls night out restaurant repertoire."}
{"text":"Went there on a week day evening.  All I can say is the waitress was nice and the beer was good.  The food was awful.  Paid extra for the bison burger and it was just awful.  Go for drinks on game nights, but eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Our server, Tod, was super friendly and provided great service. They were having a special and their $6 pizzas couldn't be beat! All of the food there is amazing and not just like every other sports bar. They have some really great vegetarian options too :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, the bartender was a complete asshole, the beer tasted like shit and the food sucked!  How do you screw up Stella Artoise and wings, for gods sake...well, have a staff that insults you, makes you feel like an inconvenience and apparently hate their jobs is one way.  Avoid this shithole at all costs, Flannerys Irish pub is next door with an awesome staff, food and drinks"}
{"text":"Quiet night, stopped here because it was close by my friends and open late (we didn't want to go somewhere where the cooks were close to leaving for the night....)

Excellent service by our waitress.  Friendly, helpful, even went so far as to bring our burgers out fresh and hot instead of making them sit and cool off waiting for the fries to finish.  Well done.

Only complaint:  they ran out of ice cream for the choco chip cookie dessert.  We took it without (it was still tasty) but ended up paying the full $5 for it.  I think knockin' a buck off for the missing component would have helped.

Still, we'd go back again as the food was tasty and done exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"I was at Harry Buffalo over the weekend for the first time since moving back home. I was more than impressed! The food and drinks were awesome and the service was exceptional! The upgraded TVs make it the perfect place to watch any sporting event. Not to mention, the addition of the \"barcade\", with tons of arcade games/pinball that are FREE to play, makes this place a go-to in Lakewood. To make it even better, I won $100 playing Keno. My only complaint is about my hangover, but that's my fault, not theirs."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place. Friday nights for country jam. Love it!"}
{"text":"I thought the Harry Buffalo was a great place to hang out in Downtown for a quick bite & cold beer. We stopped in on a Saturday for some appetizers and had the nachos. They were really good. The beer wasn't that expensive. More importantly, it was nice & cold. Great location. In the summertime, the have big, wooden windows that a propped open, and you get a great breeze that moves in through the bar. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Harry Buffalo is right in the middle of the coolest 4th Street and Quicken Loans Arena. It seems like it's the place to be before or after a basketball game. We liked it because you know what to expect: standard American sports bar with TVs, bar food and cheap beers.

Food was nothing out of the world but I would say somewhere between average and above average. We ordered wings, cheese bread and $3 beers. They actually have over 10+ sauces you can choose for their wings: buffalo, bbq, something spicy, something sweet, little bit of something for everyone. This place accomplished the purpose of our visit after the game so we were satisfied. The servers were attentive and regularly checked in to see if we were doing alright. Great for small and big groups for a fun night! 

Check it out when you are in downtown or close by!"}
{"text":"It's a crowded sports bar. 

Several people in our group ordered the bison burger medium-rare for the extra $3. The closest the kitchen came was medium-well, and two black bricks. The only reason I'm keeping it at three stars is because I half expected that, and the service was otherwise good for such a large group."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game which is why I gave it 2 stars!  Food not so good!!  Bland with little flavor!!  Don't get the prime rib!!!"}
{"text":"I was in a dire situation.  I was in the suburbs and I needed food.  I admit it- I went into this Harry Buffalo place.  It was loud.  It was obnoxious.  It was everything I hate about suburbia, chain restaurants, and embodied the classic opening sequence from Weeds with Malvina Reynolds's song Little Boxes.  Multiple television sets blasted assorted sports games and people cheered as though they were playing on the teams themselves.  The menu is huge and a bit overwhelming.  They do have a pretty good build your own salad section of the menu.  Being there is incredibly uncomfortable.  The salad was very tasty."}
{"text":"the bison burger were not edible to our liking also to noisy with the bowling alley. the waffle fries were rubbery. don't come back"}
{"text":"We stopped here, because we didn't feel like driving across town for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. Serving sizes are huge, service was alright, all over happy with the experience."}
{"text":"I love this place - the food, people, and staff are awesome!  The wings and buffalo burger make me want to crap my pants they are so good.  Definitely stop here for some food and drinks!"}
{"text":"The most awesome customer service I've ever had. Staff is helpful, polite, and give great food advice. Manager was especially accomodating and made sure we had a great experience. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for great food and even better service."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere! I am only driving through the area for the night and this was an awesome find. The staff were super friendly and quick. The waitress recommended the open face bison burger with hummus and avocado slices that came with a side salad with pecans, apple slices, strawberries and dried cranberries. The food was amazing! I couldn't have been any happier leaving this place. And for the men...the staff are all VERY attractive haha."}
{"text":"Stopped overnight on the way from Wisconsin to Penna and saw the sign while driving by the mall.  Burgers & salads were great.  Waitress couldn't have been nicer.  Sound level a bit much, but bearable.  A fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Walked in, immediate service. 
I wasn't sure of what I wanted to drink. The bartender, kelly, was accommodating and cool. 
I ordered the tenders tossed in spicy barbecue with garlic buffalo Parmesan on the side. Food arrived hot, but the gbp sauce was cold. Not complaining because that means it had been on ice or in the fridge as it should be. Can't be mad at properly handled food. 
If I was a secret shopper Kelly would have a perfect score. She ID'd me, recommended items, checked back, yada yada. Bonus points for having the same name as me."}
{"text":"I wont repeat what everyone else has said. Its a great place to have some beers on a weekend night. Do not go here for the food!!  Honestly a Wendys classic single is better than the Buffs burger. Chicken tenders had no meat on them just breading. I agree that the beer list is pretty weak."}
{"text":"Came in today to treat my staff to a lunch. First time there and I probably will not be back. One of my staff attempted to get the attention of a roaming waitress and a bartender and they both turned away. 
Took the wait staff about 10 minutes to come and ask us for a drink. 

We ordered several appetizers, those were good, but the plates( all 6 of them) they gave to us to eat off of were dirty with old food and a brown liquid all over them. Another waiter took them away, we watched him search threw a pile of \"clean\" plates and he ended up taking them all back into the kitchen. He never came back!

Food was so-so. My chicken salad was supposed to be on multi-grain bread and it was served on hot buttered texas toast. 

Maybe it was lunch time, that was the reason for the poor service and dirty plates. But I am not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Good beer. Nice folks. Kitchen was closed at 12 so good times. Really nice staff but open the kitchen longer on Saturday."}
{"text":"Me and a group of people have been coming here for a long time it was always our favorite place to go. Lately it is going down hill and fast the service is so terrible now and the manager seems to not really care about what you think unless your saying something good. We are looking for a new place to go now. For sure lost customers and I don't see us being the last. Get it together harry buffalo"}
{"text":"Terrible service; waited for 10 minutes for someone to take a drink order.  Ordered the chicken and shrimp entree. Chicken was good, but shrimp was small and overcooked. Rice was okay. Veggies were good and not overcooked."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.   Nice way to watch the Browns win.  Try the BBQ pork or CLE cheesesteak sandwich.  We liked both.  Great selection of draft beer too"}
{"text":"Thought things were off to a great start when our drinks arrived promptly.  The food, unfortunately was a different story... this is how things played out:
1) gave server our order (which did include modifications- no BBQ, add mayo on the sandwich)
2) food arrived- one salad was missing and my sandwich was slathered in BBQ, no mayo
3) salad arrives- it's comprised of lettuce and cheese (that's it, noticeably missing were the carrots, tomatoes, and croutons from the menu), sandwich arrives- no BBQ (yay!) but also no mayo... we also realize we have no silverware.
4) friend asks sever for tomatoes- she brings back a ramekin with 1 cherry tomato in it (yes, you read that right, a single tomato).  
5) mayo arrives after one more request

Just when I think the frustration is over, the bill arrives... what's this? Charged for a side of ranch (that was never ordered or received)? Last straw... As someone who waited tables for 6 years, I can assure you it pained me to leave a mere 10% tip.  However, also as a former server, there was no way  I was going to reward that crap service."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders in town, I love all the Harry Buffalos but this one has best location to grab drinks or food before a Cavs, Indians or even Browns game. Great energy with super friendly staff!!! Thanks for having me Harry Buffalo! See you next time :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Service is always impeccable. The manager Jillian saved our butts as we ordered Browns tickets online and it required us to print.. she happily helped us and printed the tickets for us here. What a gal! I recommend this place to any Browns, Cavs & Indians fans from all over even if your from outta town!! The best."}
{"text":"I used to love this place as they have big juicy wings. Well, not any more. These had to see the smallest wings I have ever seen. I thought maybe it was just mine but all the wings coming out were the same. Very sad. You need to fix this Harry Buffalo as you used to have great wings."}
{"text":"Bartender seemed distracted by a group of guys at bar. A friend and I ordered tacos, 4 beef and 1 pulled pork. She brings back 4 beef one chicken. OK, I thought to self, she  must have heard order wrong. I don't eat chicken. I mentioned the wrong order to her and said I think you heard me wrong, I wanted the pulled pork. She responded, \"No, you said chicken and beef\". 
I stopped myself and just said well, OK may I have a pork taco and my friend will just eat the chicken... I guess my point would be, as part of the service industry, is to roll with it. Don't try to argue with me. Plus in the end on the printed  receipt I was charged with the original order I said and she then had to adjust the receipt. Also the bar was out of both kinds of Jim Beam we wanted.  
Tacos were good. Hate to nit pick, but plenty bars to hit up in Lakewood where they serve the whiskey wanted and don't need a bartender trying to argue with me."}
{"text":"Eh. Just okay. The prices are decent but the food is mediocre. None of what we ordered was particularly tasty or hot. The buffalo chicken dip was pretty good and so were the onion rings. But the burrito uno was not very good. It was a Mexican Asian fusion dish and it just didn't work. The wings were decent but one kind we ordered was drowning in sauce and the other kind didn't have any sauce and we had to ask for more sauce. Plus it was extremely loud and a lot of drunk and obnoxious people at the bar. I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Beer was ice cold. Food left a bit to be desired. I had high hopes for the chili cheese fries, but something wasn't right with them. Ordered a burger which was average. The worst part was the service. We saw our waitress twice, and she forgot I had asked for a side of ranch with the fries. Also, my beer was empty about 10 mins after I arrived. I'm an easy sell for beer, but she if I wanted another at the same time she gave me my check."}
{"text":"We ordered take out wings and ribs, they were terrible.  The wing sauce was like a salt lick (mild).  The plain wings we ordered were ok,  the ribs were not good either, three tiny bones for a dinner order??? Again, not good, never again for $40, just not worth it, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good place but with poor food and slow service."}
{"text":"Awful food and crappy service. Thank God they have a bar for the infrequent times it's the only place around that is open.  I've been here a few times and it's consistently horrible. I avoid it now."}
{"text":"We stopped here twice in one day I we the weekend. 

The first time: we sat at a booth around the bar to eat and grab a beer while watching a football game. Our server was Chris I believe and he was great- very nice, knowledgable about the menu, checked on us just the right amount of times, kept our drinks full and was quick about everything. My husband had a bison burger that he really enjoyed and I had a buffalo chicken sandwich that had cheese and Mac n cheese on it which was really good and really filling. 

The second time: we sat at the bar to watch the Ohio state game. We had a few beers and a few shots. The bartender was nice and attentive but not annoying. We had a good time.

Note: my husband said the men's restroom was very small and smelled horrible. I thought the women's restroom was fine though.  

Overall: we had a great time and would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really like the food but our last experience may be our last visit  The waitresses are cute but provide horrible service.  The food is solid but service, beer selection, and common sense on customer service is killing the the place.  Good bye!"}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich has intense flavors going on!  My daughter had the loaded potato soup- she loved the creamy cheesiness! The bison chili had the perfect amount of heat!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waitress was so rude.  Buffalo burger was only half a patty.  Tried to seat 7 people at a table for 4 and was mad when we asked for a larger table.  Was mad because she had to clean an extra table.  Then she was our waitress for the evening. Four checks at one table and we were charged a 20 percent gratuity on each check.  It was service that was terrible.  The manager said he would give us a round of drinks after our bills were already paid.  Not the point. The waitress did not deserve that type of tip.  The wait station was right behind the wall where my seat was and I could hear her complaining the whole time about her customers. We have eaten here many times and brought friends with us.  How embarrassing.  Will never go back.  Funny I looked at this site just before I posted this and other customers had the same complaint,   Harry Buffalo won't be around much longer with all of the other competitors in Cleveland.  Good Luck you will need it"}
{"text":"Truly great drinks. Best Mac n cheese in a bar.

They have a younger acting crowd that is really in their 30s and 40s and tons of fun. Will totally come back here for sporting events.

You really need to try the Harry buffalo drink!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy their burgers and bison burgers (note: order the bison burgers med-rare or medium for the juiciest results since it is much leaner than beef and will dry out if you like it medium well or well done) and their fries are great too. Tons of beer & tons of flat screens :)"}
{"text":"I got kicked out for no reason. Security kicked me out. Man.... they said I was bothering people. Sooo...... gooooood dam retardeeeed. Man this place is terrible, it's all I got to say. If I had the chance to go back, I wouldn't."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go to when I travel to the Cleveland section of Ohio. The food is always constantly good and the service is always excellent. My favorites are the wings and Bison Chili."}
{"text":"I think a lot of the reviews here are unfair, I mean look at how many reviews the complainers have posted.  That doesn't mean that they weren't bad experiences though.  

Our experience wasn't perfect and there is room for the service to get better (this could easily be a four star).  For example, I ordered wings and a burger and the waitress thought they were both entrées; luckily it came up in conversation when one of the other apps came out.   It's best to ask if someone orders an appetizer when they would like it if you believe it's an entree.  This comes with training though.    Plates for apps took some time, and only after being requested.   Those should be brought out right after apps are ordered.

The service had bright spots too though.  My drink was kept full, and the server had the other servers run food out when it was ready. The service was also very bubbly, but this was do to the age of the servers.  The age of the servers possibly contributed to the service gaps.  I'd suggest bringing in a few older servers to help train them.  

The food was acceptable,  but not exceptional.   The wings were bland for my taste, and they needed some marinading or seasoning prior to cooking.  I think they were cooked without any prep.  The rest of the table liked them though and they all loved the boom boom sause. The bison burger was very greasy,  which made me question if there was beef mixed with it.  It was a pretty good burger though.  

I would come back here, but wouldn't give any recommendations until after a second visit."}
{"text":"We had the buffalo chicken egg roll appetizer, which was delicious! The rest of the meal (turkey ranchero wrap and fish tacos) was typical bar type food. Nothing special but good for lunch!"}
{"text":"I only started eating here recently, but I have been going out here for years. It's a great place for a weekend night out or to catch a game. And the food is good too. While I have not ventured out much on the menu, the pizzas are good (big enough to share) and the BBQ Santa Fe salad is also delicious. The service here has always been great as well -- they brought me out the wrong salad last time I went, and they fixed the mistake quickly and gave my boyfriend and me, our beers on the house. Great place if you want to stop in and watch a game, grab a bite to eat or just hang out on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way. I can't believe the new menu!? Excellent food and creative menu items that you would never expect from a local bar in Lakewood. My girlfriend and I make regular visits and they never disappoint. Great place to eat, drink and watch a game. Especially if you want restaurant quality food in bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide on a restaurant in the area last night and kind of just wandered in here as it was close to where I stayed the night! Got seated and almost just got up and left because the menus and drink menu on table were pretty disgusting (how much effort does it take to wipe the things down with a hot soapy towel and dry?) Well, our server, Brian got our drink order and (when asked) told us the Pita Chip Nachos were good and very good with Bison Chili added on top! The entrees were not really catching my eye so we ordered a Deluxe Pizza (yes at a place called Harry Buffalo) and very surprised at the meats, tomato sauce, cheese and the crust. I think this pizza was as good as most in pizza chains! Overall, could have given 3-1/2 stars to possibly 4 stars BUT the initial shock at the grossly dirty menus (and silverware) almost chased me off!"}
{"text":"This review is based off my most recent experience that was so fantastic I have to write about it! I want to start with a special shout out to the Manager that was working when we came to visit last Saturday! 

I was with a birthday party of about 15-18 people and the place we were supposed to go to didn't work out (due to poor management) and the manager that was working made accommodations for us that were so perfect for our party that we had a blast! When we walked in and told him how many people were in our party, he offered us the basement area and sent a bartender down right away to open up the bar area so we could order drinks. The bartender was great and we had a fantastic time partying on the whim!"}
{"text":"This is the most stressful place. I came during a big event, so I know that that really just added to the chaos, but there's something about \"Harry Buffalo\" that just screams not my kind of place. The only good part I could find about it was the chicken fingers. Our waitress messed up our order--she was frazzled and probably not paying as much attention as she should have--so we only got one dish between two of us, but it worked out fine. I would probably order that chicken to-go again, but I highly doubt I'll ever return for anything else."}
{"text":"Came with my fiancé and waited 10 minutes, with multiple employees passing by us in the patio and not even acknowledging us. Needless to we ended up just leaving. At least say hello. I still have yet to try the food here. Perhaps we will have a better experience at a different location."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Decent food, fries came out cold and the buffalo chicken dip is literally grilled chicken diced over cream cheese dip-hardly any buffalo flavor. For a delicious buffalo dip walk down the street to the winking lizard! Service was slow. Overall not terrible- but there are much better options right down the street."}
{"text":"This place has a great location and drink options, but everything else is pretty average. Food is good but not amazing. Lots of TVs for when the game is on. Service is decent, but our server made us check out early because she was leaving after she'd messed up taking our order a few times bc she didn't want to write it down. Later, she messed up the split on our bill twice. 


Besides the drinks and location, we got the pita nachos as an app and those were pretty good. Overall it was alright. Might go back to watch a game, but it's not a place I'd tell out of town friends about."}
{"text":"I feel like you know what to expect when you go to The Buff. It's a chain. I will say that the food is a bit above par from the other chain options. I recommend the Buffalo Chicken Melt. Drink prices are typical, happy hour is the best option. Gets busy at this location on weekend evenings since it is right around other bars where people frequent. The pizza at Harry Buffalo never disappoints either."}
{"text":"Great BBQ chicken salad and Amazon bison burger. The bartenders, Kelsey and Taylor, were so attentive and friendly. Must go"}
{"text":"Dinner 9-15-12
We used yelp to find this place for dinner after a ball game.  I would give the place 2 stars but would hate to lead other out of towners into this establishment as we were.  
The food:
It was okay.  Bar food that was reasonably priced with some interesting options.  No one was grossed out but nothing was a must return to eat again item--even if for some reason I decided to go to Cleveland again.  

So why the one star hateful review?  Because it took a million years to get incredibly mediocre meals and drinks.  Yes, it was busy but it really wasn't that busy.  Put another waitress on staff for the shift serving directly after a ball game across the street.  This seems obvious to me.  However given that the music in the place is coming from someone's iphone pandora ap what else could we expect? (we know this because the phone started ringing which was blasted on the speakers throughout the restaurant.  Stay classy, Cleveland.)

To sum it up--don't come here unless you have time to waste."}
{"text":"Went back again and the wings were great!  Problem is I wanted to eat there the night before, but they were out of wings and it was only 8pm!  It was New Years Day, so that may have had something to do with it, but I had just worked 11 hours and was craving them.  Even so, how does a place that specializes in wings run out??  Oh well, they are very good - just call ahead to be sure they still have them."}
{"text":"Big place that offers late night dance. Youngish crowd, bit cliquish, but I had a great time. Good selection of beers. (visited Aug 2013)."}
{"text":"Last night my girlfriend and I had the pleasure of dining at the Harry Buffalo. We chose it randomly walking down 4th street simply because it was the only place still serving. Being from out of town and late on a Tuesday, we didn't expect much, but we were pleasantly surprised. We had expected decent food and shoddy service which is par for many places an hour before close. What we got was Joe. Joe was one of the most friendly and engaging server's we have ever experienced. He was attentive and his food suggestions turned out fabulous. To our surprise, we found out later that he had only been working there a month. Employees like Joe are what turn a successful business into a local staple! Joe has a very bright future. We had wings and a buffalo burger which were both very fresh and cooked perfectly. The beer was cold and cheap. We will make it a point to come back and visit Joe at the Harry Buffalo every time we are back in town!"}
{"text":"This is an average sports bar. We got a bison burger and fried chicken. The burger was perfect, and the fried chicken was good. The chicken by itself was bland, but the honey hot sauce on the side was amazing. 
I was confused by the jojo potatoes. They're quartered potatoes that are battered and fried like an awkwardly thick version of the western fries we have on the east coast. I would have much rather had them cut like normal potato wedges, or just as waffle fries.
This is a bizarre complaint, but the food was actually way too hot. I burned myself on the chicken and potatoes. I had to let it sit for close to 20 minutes before I could eat it. I would have cut it up to cool it faster, but there wasn't any silverware and our waitress never came back to check on us.
Our waitress seemed to be totally clueless. She had no idea what beers were avaliable. I confirmed that the menu insert with weekly specials was valid before ordering, since it said the prices weren't valid for event days. My meal was the regular price on the reciept. When we pointed it out, she said that she'd fix it. We watched her talk to the bar tender, and at least one other waitress before coming back and saying the specials weren't being offered that day. There were no games and the restaurant was almost empty, so I wasn't exactly sure what the issue was."}
{"text":"Hambones and Hooknasties abound."}
{"text":"I've been here occasionally when someone wants a buffalo burger. They must be good, but I can't say I've had one myself. Had a mahi sandwich the last time which was actually quite good. Otherwise the restaurant / bar is so-so. A little dark if you aren't sitting by the windows, but you can play trivia while you wait."}
{"text":"Oh, Harry buffalo elyria. Just downright delightful. Brilliant atmosphere, beautiful people. 






BUT WAIT, THERES MORE

Come on down now for Christmas ale, limited time only! Drink selection is varied and the food, while traditional, has a special twist to it."}
{"text":"They changed their burgers from grass fed beef to Angus beef.  I didn't order one.  Instead I ordered a chicken sandwich with ham, cheese, and bacon.  The bacon was a flavored bacon and threw off the taste of the sandwich.  Such a bummer.  Someone needs to re-think that flavor combination.  Service was slow."}
{"text":"My wife and I took our two grandsons to Harry Buffalo in Highland Heights because our grandsons wanted to play the video games they have there. Our server, Maggie, was absolutely great.  She was very friendly and took very good care of us. She was the only bright spot of the evening. 
We ordered two kids meals for our grandsons.  One order was the boneless wings with fries, and the other was a cheeseburger with fries. My wife specified that the wings should mild.
My wife and I split a regular order of traditional wings with teriyaki sauce. 
There was only one order that was made ok, and that was the cheeseburger.  The boneless wings were too spicy for our grandson and after tasting them, they were on the spicy side for a kid, so we ordered another kid's wings just plain. The server was nice enough to replace the meal without an additional charge.  
The regular wings that I ordered was a total disaster.  The order came with the wings sitting in a pool of teriyaki sauce which absolutely killed any chance of tasting the wings.  These were by far the worst order of wings that I ever had. I had two wings and couldn't eat any more, and my wife only had two wings herself.
I could not recommend eating here in good conscious.  
The noise level was a bit loud for our taste.
I have eaten at other Harry Buffalo restaurants and was very pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"came across this bar & grill on Yelp and videogames were NOT free... food was delicious!! I ordered a turkey avacado sandwich (it came out without avacado? still tasty though), mac n cheese was soooooo creamy. my brother went with a bacon bbq burger, which came with waffle fries. never seen him eat so fast!! said it was great and he would definitely order again. overall the food was great, but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Crowded main bar layout....can't sit there comfortably. God forbid it's hot out...they open up the front of the building which allows for zero airflow and just allows you to enjoy the heat from the outside instead of any air conditioning. 
Hopefully you like insecure frat boys with beer muscles, being bumped into, and feeling generally uncomfortable, cause if you are, you got it!!!!"}
{"text":"Good bar food and drink. Great place to watch game. One less star because they do not adequately staff the back (resturant) side of the bar. For some reason there are 3 bartenders on the patio side and none on the resturant side which makes for slow service. They \"check\" on the back, but not often enough."}
{"text":"Located right in the parking lot at the Great Northern Mall I've passed this place many times and decided to stop in for a early dinner. We were seated immediately the place was not busy at all. From the start the service was quick slow it did improve a little as time went on. I am not really a fan of the menu or the food it's average at best nothing memorable.

- Ice Tea - A little weak nothing special I ordered it unsweetened with no lemon they got the unsweetened ,correct but put a big dirty lemon slice in my glass strike one I hate having a fresh lemon that most likely hasn't been 
washed and handled by many people in my tea lol.

- Chicken Dumpling Soup - Not bad but not homemade I should have stopped there.

- Cheesy Bread - Basically a pizza crust with garlic oil and cheese very very greasy not a fan

- Dry Rub Cajun Boneless Wing - These had to come from a box not impressed.

- Truffle Fries - Best part of the dinner not bad great idea wish I would have gotten them a little faster when they were hot.

- BBQ Ribs - Almost too tender like they were steamed no bark and too much sauce meh"}
{"text":"This is hambone/hooknasty haven on the weekends. The big garage door windows open in the summer, making it not a bad place to grab lunch. It is a typical early twenties white, middle class pick-up joint on Lakewood's west end. 

The \"mayor of Lakewood\" often is spotted here."}
{"text":"Quite possibly some of the worst service I've ever had. My waitress, Samantha, acted like she had better things to do. If you don't like your job, and the fact you're working on a Friday night, then quit. I asked her if they had mojitos (which might have been my first mistake based on how the place looked) but figured it was worth a shot. She replied \"we have margaritas if that'll do.\" 

And that's really where it started. They should have called the margarita a glass of sweet and sour. So, I decided to switch to vodka. Same thing. They screwed up my second drink- apparently asking for more than one thing in the drink was too much for the waitress and/or bartender to handle, because my drink was missing the vodka and splash of lemonade I asked for. 

Unbelievable how awful this place was. Needless to say, we left and I hope I never come back."}
{"text":"One of the best casual spots in downtown Cleveland and definitely the best place to go before any event at Quicken loans Arena or to catch a baseball game at progressive Field. There are three different sections in the place, two downstairs and a very large upstairs with a bar as well. They have some of the best wings in town and the bison burgers are awesome. They have a great craft beer selection to choose from as well. Every time on there I have good service and the place is very clean. This is also a place I do frequent take out and everything always comes out great. When there are large events going on like Cavaliers postseason, Indians opening day or St. Patrick's Day they usually run out the parking lots next-door and have a big party that are always a great time. I highly recommend if you are in the area are going to the gateway district."}
{"text":"I have to write this just so I can add them to my Sweet Potato list. They have sweet potato wafers and they are AWESOME! Although I'm not sure I've met a sweet potato I don't like?
The menu is diverse, lots of options. But it's just a sports bar. But they also have decent beer on tap. I was especially fond of the Vanilla Porter (Breckenridge Brewery I believe) and the Christmas Ale, which is some local brew, only made at Xmas time, and actually often sold out at bars all over Cleveland during the holidays. But worth grabbing a pint when available.
It's right by the Q and Progressive Field so mostly busy before games and then not so much other times. My hotel was right across the street so it was convenient and decent enough to return more than once or twice and did I mention they have Sweet Potato wafers!?!"}
{"text":"Very good service. I stopped by for lunch on a fairly quite day, ordered the Mac and cheese side and didn't enjoy it at all - when the waitress came by to pick it up she asked about it specifically since I had barely touched it compared to the rest of the food. I mentioned it wasn't really what I was expecting (it was weirdly sweet and not very cheesy) and she comped the side when she brought the bill without any questions. Was very surprised and appreciated the notion."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! we went on a Monday for the chicken wing special. They were Delicious! I also had a buffalo burger and it too was amazing. Since it is less fatty than beef, you can taste the spices they add to the meat. Quite tasty. 
Definitely go here."}
{"text":"This may have been the best bison burger I have ever had.  It was tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The only thing keeping this place from having a 5 was the service.  After our server took our order we did not see her again until it was time to hand us the check.  That was a disappointment as my wife's sandwich was not delivered as ordered and we could not get anyone's attention to help her."}
{"text":"Just went to pick up my order for carryout and they had no record of my order and I left empty handed. This just erased any positive feelings I had for this joint!  Save yourself the time and gas!"}
{"text":"After traveling from Columbus to meet a longtime friend we decided on wings at this establishment. After being seated and given menus and water our server never returned to the table.  There were maybe 3 other patrons in the restaurant at this time so they were not busy.  After waiting for approximately 15 minutes and watching her chat and interact with co-workers and we decided to leave.  The server never acknowledged my friend or myself."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I ordered food for pick up and they told me it would be 15-20 minutes, when I got there I had to wait an additional 20 minutes because they told me they were out of eggs and had someone run to the store to get them (so unprofessional). When I got to my car I checked the bag and realized they gave me an entirely wrong sandwich. This isn't the first time I had to waste my time here either."}
{"text":"2 stars for this place and / or Yelp. They advertise as restaurant open until 2AM. Kitchen closes well before midnight - if you want a late night drink with nothing to munch on - nothing - than you will be good."}
{"text":"The buff in Lakewood is my favorite place to get a burger. I love that they sell bison burgers which are much leaner and they give you a choice of a pretzel bun. You will never go back to a normal burger bun once you've had one of these! The staff is so amazing to me every time I go in there. They have genuine conversations with you when you sit at the bar and have very quick service. Love going there on the weekends too because it's never too crowded and even when it is you never wait very long for a drink :)"}
{"text":"Each time I order takeout I have to check everything before I leave.  If I order a burger with no butterr, they butter the burger buns.  If I order no onion, I get an onion.  If I order lettuce and tomato, they are missing.  So I stopped ordering and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were seated outside by the hostess and after about 15 minutes a waitress still had not come to our table even though the other tables outside were being helped. My boyfriend went inside to see if we could get service. He explained we were sitting outside and they said someone would be out. After another 5-10 minutes of the waitress helping the other table and still not acknowledging us he went back in and they said they did not see us. When someone finally came out to our table and was taking our drink order the other waitress said we should move because I was sitting next to puke. We then moved over to the table next to where we were sitting. They then cleaned up the puke by dumping buckets of water on it which then made it spread out and got very close to our new table. Finally they got a brush and cleaned it a bit better; however, there were still some small chunks left on the ground (close to us).  The food tasted okay--not anything out of this world. The rest of our service was average.  We have been in the past and had great food and service. Based on this visit I will not be returning and I hope management addresses this situation."}
{"text":"Quality people & quality burgers! The staff is always friendly and on top of it even when it gets crazy busy (and it does). Great place to meet up with friends, grab a bite, and watch a game."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Radison across the street a few weeks ago.  On the recommendation of the clerk, they suggested we head to Harry Buffalo's for drinks.  What a recommendation!  First of all, $6 pitchers of beer, gtfo.  $2 shots, ok, bring them on.  I love Cleveland for how incredibly cheap it is to get inebriated."}
{"text":"Rude service. Will not go back. 

I've been to a Harry Buffalo before so when my friends and I were in Cleveland, I suggested it. 

We went in and were greeted by a sign asking us to seat ourselves. We sat at a round table in a corner. A server came up to us and without saying \"hi\" or introducing himself, asked us how many were in our party. When we replied \"three,\" he proceeded to make us move to another table as that particular one was reserved for parties of five or more. It is also important to not that upon approaching our table and interacting with us, he was chewing on food. 
He proceeded to take our drink orders, still without actually greeting us or providing his name. He seemed burdened when he realized we needed menus. The menus provided were wrinkled and wet. They were disgusting. When he delivered our drinks we asked for a few more minutes to look at the menu. Upon his return, he stood by the table and stared at us. Did not check for understanding, did not ask if we had questions. Nothing. We placed our order and waited. He went to a table a few down from ours and sat down to finish eating. 

Our food was delivered by a different person. She didn't ask if we needed anything. I had to flag our server down to ask for sauces. He did not check to see if we liked our meals. My friend had to ask for another drink multiple times. When we finished, he cleared away our plates and walked away, again failing to ask about our meals. He came back a few minutes later to see if we wanted the check. 

After my friend paid, there was no \"thank you\" no \"come back\" nothing. He was so rude. 

Not one worker in the entire establishment was smiling or friendly. Our server, whose name is Mike, was apathetic. 

Overall, the burgers were decent. Skip the buffalo chicken mac n cheese sandwich. It's mostly mac n cheese between two pieces of toast. Gross. 

This restaurant experience was awful. Based on this, I will not go to another Harry Buffalo and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Appears to be closed since the middle of December 2016.  No reason given."}
{"text":"Pretty solid waffle fries and bison burgers were good, overall good vibe nice service , I will be coming back"}
{"text":"A-OK. Welp, I mean Yelp, I mean who?

The service was the reason I couldnt give 4 stars, welp, and the food portion, w(y)elp, and the pricing. I believe the buffalo in the room is wondering why the service was lacking? Do you see what I did there? With the buffalo reference? Also, is that thing real? Can you e-mail me at buffalo222@yelp.com with an answer. By the by, I created that e-mail years before I dined here, so please don't even think about suing me. Um. The tribe is killing it!"}

{"text":"Good paleo choices: bison burger with boiled broccoli for side dish. Service ok, but only one server for one entire room. Was advised to sit at bar if I wanted to eat sooner, which I did and all was well."}
{"text":"This restaurant has huge potential, but fails to meet it at every turn.  The draft beer lineup is weak, the menu is completely over the top, food is below mediocre and service is just so-so.  There are plenty of other places to eat that serve better food with better service in this price range."}
{"text":"You gotta get a bison burger when you're here, delicious!  The staff is attentive, polite and fast.  Nice atmosphere with over 15 TVs to catch your favorite game.  Decent beer selection on tap and in bottles.  Check it out when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Harry Buffalo, clean your beer tap lines! This was the surprise at the bottom of my first beer, see pics.  I informed my server and she brought me another one.   I couldn't see the debris until the glass was nearly empty.   Oh, and BTW I had to pay for both.  I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for a few beers and casual food.  Great service, great setting, decent beer selection.  I'm sure that people may balk at the crowds etc. but they do a fantastic job here when they are super busy and when they are super slow.  We went before a Cav's game and it was a perfect stop for us."}
{"text":"Surprised at how good the butter cheesesteak was. Great service and friendly bar staff."}
{"text":"Afraid I can't think of anything nice to say about this place. Dingy, dirty bar. Service was outrageously slow. Drinks were not very good. I'd suggest exploring other nearby options."}
{"text":"Ugh. I don't like this chain normally anyway, and this location is just bad.  It's in a cool area but go across the street instead if you're in Lakewood. The service sucks, the food is nothing exciting. I may just be sick of this place because I've gone too many times.. Big groups who just can't decide so they settle for this place. Don't do it, if you can help it. We waited so long for our food. They did bring us shots as an apology but that just shouldn't have to happen! It's always a cool layout at these bars but I have never been impressed by the service or foods/drinks."}
{"text":"The service was great! They were extremely hospitable however, the food wasn't as great as I expected. I had the dry Cajun wings. They were very salty. The waffle fries were good. For someone like myself who has an egg allergy and the menu has limited options."}
{"text":"Would be amazing patio if they disallowed smoking on the patio... Gross. Who smokes anymore? Disgusting. Food is amazing nonetheless - do a bison burger on pretzel roll - you'll never regret it. But H Buff, please create a smoking area somewhere aside from your beautiful covered patio!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in for some drinks before the game and the smell was awful. I can't even describe how unsettling it was. Not sure how someone could eat smelling that. Asked for the happy hour draft and went to the bathroom. On the way there, the bartender stopped me and said no happy hour on game days. Ok. Went to the bathroom. It was the most disgusting thing I have seen. We left. Between the smell and the bathroom, I couldn't take anymore."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  The buffalo burger was messy and tasty.  It was slightly gamey and slightly tame.  Pretzel bun rocked.  $5 pitcher on a Saturday night?  It don't get much better than this.  At least in Ohio it doesn't..."}
{"text":"party of 8. Highlights included my salad with fruit & nuts and the truffle fries. Everything else was basic bar food."}
{"text":"Saturday night we had a group of 8 for dinner and drinks. Our check we'll over $150 and we were charged $1 for requesting ice in our drinks! Seriously... we ordered whisky on ice. When asked about the $1 per drink charge  , the explanation was \" you actually get a little more whiskey when it is on ice so we have to charge more\"! Funny, the other bars aren't charging us. We were just at Pacers, down the street the night before ordering the same drinks and there was not a $1 per drink ice fee!"}
{"text":"I have had lunch three times here in the last week. They got it right every time. The lunch bowls, the tacos and had a chicken entree for lunch today. The buff has definitely stepped their food game up. The service is great, always plenty of staff to go around. Not that it effects the food but the staff is gorgeous which always helps :-) love this place."}
{"text":"Great southern twist.  Good food and atmosphere.  Great beer selection as well.  Will stop in again when in area."}
{"text":"I like the new location and atmosphere and appreciate the decorations. I called for take out a few weeks ago and no one answered the phone. It was a Saturday night. I called multiple times and finally gave up.

I wrote a message explaining my attempt and a manager wrote me back. Very nice and apologized. He offered to send me a gift card, so I sent him my address. I waited over a week and still didn't receive it so I emailed him again. Once again, he apologized and said he was out of town and  would find out what happened when he returned. Once he returned, he told me that the person who was supposed to send the gift card never did. He asked if I wanted him to mail it or just keep at the restaurant for my next visit. I told him to mail it. And still....no gift card and he hasn't returned my email message. Needless to say, I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"This used to be a good place, but my last visit was probably just that -- my last visit.  They used to have very good ribs, no longer offered.   I did have a chicken sandwich which was very good, but not what I intended.   I wanted a cocktail (this is mainly a bar after all) and asked for a scotch.  The server said \"we don't have scotch.\"   Disappointment #2.  How can a bar not offer scotch?  I did take the time to send a note to their headquarters expressing my disappointment, just got a note from the manager saying \"we do have scotch, we were out of it.\"   Well that is just as bad as the server telling me \"we don't have scotch.\"   A good bar will have multiple brands and qualities to offer so his response of \"we were out of it\" tells me no one there is paying attention if they ran out of all the various brands they supposedly carry.   If they're that careless stocking the bar, are they also careless stocking the kitchen?"}
{"text":"I've been to Harry Buffalo a handful of times, trying to decipher what is my go to order from here. Usually it's wings or a sandwich/wrap of some sort. I personally like the Turkey Ranchero Wrap and the MotherClucker the most out of all the sandwiches/wraps I have had from there. I don't know why but I usually skip right over the Hennny Hot Chicken but today I decided to give it a try. Overall I liked it, but I thought it would be more spicy than it was. The honey on the side was something I'd normally not think to get or use on chicken just by itself but surprisingly it goes will with how they prepare their chicken here. I also got a side of the pesto rice to go with it, which was okay but I'd probably not get it again. I'm not a huge fan of Jojo fries but these were really good, I felt they were more spicy than the chicken. Overall I'd give the chicken 4/5, definitely not a bad option to get
!"}
{"text":"I have such a love-hate relationship with Harry Buffalo. I love that they are one of the places in Cleveland to sell bison. I love that they have a plethora of tv's and play the sound for big games. The new arcade is pretty cool and is also free. The new menu is much better than the old one and features a pesto bowl which is delicious. 

What I hate about this place is typically the service and clientele. Kelly is a great bartender and is super cool, but other than that there isn't anything positive I can say about the rest of the staff. The worst part of this place though is the clientele. I would challenge my fellow yelper's to come up with a bar that attracts as my \"bros\" as this place. I literally can't sit at the bar for more than 20 minutes without my IQ dropping 10 points or being bombarded with misogynistic rhetoric. 

The manager, Mike, is a cool dude. Used to see him around the bar more often but not as much lately. 

It isn't the worst bar in Lakewood but it's far from the best. Come here for some above average food and to catch a game."}
{"text":"I had a really great lunch experience here. It wasn't too busy, mainly because there weren't any sporting events happening at the time. Our group sat in the bar area where they had the windows open and a nice breeze. Our waitress was also friendly and helpful when I needed help deciding what I wanted.

I appreciated the variety on their menu. I was with a group of diverse palettes and we all found something that we liked. I was also impressed with their attention to special diets such as gluten free, paleo, and vegetarian. As a vegetarian myself, that was a big plus. I ordered a Santa Fe Buddha Bowl, which is basically rice bowl toped with veggies and your choice of protein. It was delicious and had lots of flavor. Definitely not something I would expect to eat at an American cuisine restaurant. 

My one friend ordered their chicken quesadilla and said it was probably one of the best she'd ever had. It was stuffed with banana peppers which was a unique touch.  Another friend ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was more Asian style BBQ, so very sweet.

Summary: Great food and great location. I would love to go back on a game day and check this place out when it has the sports fan energy buzzing through it. Definitely another Cleveland favorite."}
{"text":"One of the nicer Harry Buffalo's I've been to, but was quickly ruined by our rude waitress. Food is mediocer bar food."}
{"text":"The our waitress and management were great. That's about as good as it gets. The pretzel sticks we ordered came with nacho cheese where a beer cheese or regular dipping cheese would have worked . My wife ordered ribs with Mac and cheese. The ribs had a boiled taste , the mac and cheese tasted as if it has been sitting for a while. I ordered the crispy fish fry, and it was satisfactory.  Half way with eating the fish it started to get soggy. Half of the waffle fries were not cooked all the way. It felt like everything was made ahead of time and just reheated."}
{"text":"Horrible service, are waitress never checked on us and the food took forever to come out. I was wondering why the people was standing when I came in they was waiting to check out and everybody I noticed leaving hand an attitude"}
{"text":"Update: We arrived at Harry Buffalo just before 3:00 hoping to get a table before the game today (Mother's Day). Halle greeted us and granted our request for a booth which she had to clean off. Drinks and food were delivered promptly. The manager was kind as he always is when we dine there. Food was delicious and hot! This has become our \"go to\" place with the kids. Sad they eliminated the bowling but understandable. Will be back! 

We went on St. Patricks Day. All the tables had free stuff on them which was nice. We sat at one of the tables with a Nintendo which kept my kids busy for a while. We also played Jenna until the food came. Food was delicious. We had the garlic bread and quesadillas and almost nothing was left. My husband had the bison burger and I had the Rueben, again no left overs. Our server Linda was very attentive and nice. The manager came over twice to make sure we were all doing good Did I mention there's free arcade games too? We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming into Harry Buffalo for years now and it never disappoints.  Good food, friendly staff, and always a fun time.  Harry Buffalo sponsored our rec basketball team years ago and our team loved coming here twice a week during the winter even after all the games we lost :)"}
{"text":"Travel here on business occasionally.  Decent food and good TV selection.  Typical bar.  Stop in if your around, but I wouldn't make a specific trip to do so.  Good looking bartender though."}
{"text":"I went with 2 co workers for lunch during a weekday. It was Tuesday and the special was a Burger Bonanza. Cool!
When we go in, the waitress does not explain the menu and took too long to come around and get our orders. (Who the hell charges for a pickle spear? Really?)
Mind you, there is one other table in our area and maybe 2 more in the restaurant. It's not like the place was busy. After a 25 minute wait for a burger, a sandwich, and an order of soft pretzels- my burger is made wrong and so are my fries. The waitress is no where around though. Occasionally she ducks in for  water, but she is gone before I can say anything. 
When we finally have to gesture to get our checks, she drops them and runs. Hello, we had our payment methods out! Then, we find out that the \"Burger Bonanza Special\" is for a basic, boring burger and not for the page of burgers named Burger Bonanza. If she would have explained the special, I would not have been surprised.
Oh- we received a discount because of where we work. It took 15 minutes just to get the discount applied because she couldn't find the manager. 

My entire 90 minute lunch was taken up waiting here. I expect lunch service to be quicker since most people have to get back to work. This was a huge let down and I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how or why I visited. I was engaging in a consumption-bent hallucination. The bartenders wore de rigueur slut/furry animal/naughty schoolgirl/angel/ butterfly slut halloween costumes. 

I arrived in gold. I wore gold and the herd noticed. I formed an ad-hoc committee of Friday night revelers. A man whose  hair was combed back with dollops of pomade application suggested we were punishing social Darwinists. We left when the Cavaliers could not secure a marginal lead by halftime. Our beers were served slowly and with a resigned disappointment from the costumed staff. Maybe I am older and less engaged with the sterile bile that the satellite radio calls country music. I do not  have intention for offending herds with metaphorical stories of lost love and drunken malady. You may lose your job at the dealership and sans burger and bucket of beers for some time. One of e-very seven Americans on food stamps. Give me a chance here buddy."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the food but I didn't want to sweat in the sweltering bar. When we arrived at 1930hrs it was extremely warm. I asked if they had just opened and our server said no. I asked if it was going to get any better and she said no. 

I got the feeling that she had gone through this dance before. Can't blame her. We had a drink and left. I made it clear to her that we were not going to eat in that heat. 

It was a dark day as far as Cleveland sports goes. One of the two days a year that no sports are played. (Good trivia question. Day before and day after MLB All star game!) I betcha on game nights that AC is cranking, no?

Won't be back. AAMOF I regret giving them any of my money."}
{"text":"Ended up coming here after a nearby bar kicked out our birthday party group (20) so they could close at 8:30pm on a Saturday.  The manager here at Harry Buffalo's totally made up for that by opening up their basement bar area and giving us our own bar tender!  That is a person who knows how to run a good business.  Total fun and a great story for years to come."}
{"text":"Great buffalo dip!!!! Definitely recommend this before indians games. The service is great and it's a nice view."}
{"text":"The Hubbs and I ate our last meal here about two weeks ago the service was sketchy the food not good new menu leaves a lot to be desired -  just not the Harry Buff that I remember. 

Cornbread appetizer was literally burnt on the bottom and burnt plus smoke tasting not appetizing... 

The mother clocker sandwich was over fried and had nothing but red onion all over it... Oh don't forget that it came with soggy fries... Huge plus yeah I'm kidding. 

Now the cherry on top of the sundae was the bartender who was wearing a red open backed smock that you could see she was wearing no bra and a thong in food service someone call the health department... Mostly because I think what not to wear has been canceled. Good luck if you choose to eat here you shall not see me."}
{"text":"I like to go in his place whenever we go to a baseball or basketball game and eat a little something before I go home. It usually a good place stopped in there last night and had wings and they were terrible had two sets of wings and a bison burger the wings were terrible and a bison burger was raw very very very disappointed will not be back.     
I sent you a message on the Harry Buffalo yelp site


Jacqueline B you are the Best!!!!!!!!! Everyone has a bad night sometimes! Thank you for caring! I always liked Harry Buffalos So we will go there next time we are in town. Thanks for all your help!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the location and beer selection.  they always close super early, even though their hours are til 2am"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere before a game. On our first visit, Captain Morgan and the girls were giving away shots. This time, the Coors girls offered samples of beer. Good chance a sports game of your choice will be on a TV near by. The minestrone soup was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tasty Mac and cheese sandwich, noodle bowls and salads. Friendly server. A bit pricey for what you get though."}
{"text":"Great people and service and awesome food! Always a great place to get together to watch games on all their flat screens"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic staff and fantastic food. Can't beat the location either which is a huge plus. Highly recommend and I'll definitely be back! Came back and brought my my son, on top of second to none service and fantastic food he absolutely LOVED the free arcade! He's a video game nut and this IS our new father and son spot!"}
{"text":"Every time I think this place can't get any better it does! The best lunches? food, drinks, dinner and parking in town! Fantastic staff and flawless service. And... I dare you to find colder beer in the city! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. 

Just visited last week to find the menu selections are greatly reduced. No substitutions!! Apparently impossible to just order wings. Fries must come with them. Period.

Waitress was practically missing the entire meal. Refills of beverages? Haha!

Time to get the check? Good luck. Take away boxes for leftovers? Hope you only want one, even though multiple diners want boxes.

Beer selection? Dismal. Thanks, I'll have a soda. 

I used to love this place. The good thing is - it is impossible to swing a cat on Detroit without hitting a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while visiting Cleveland. Food was good and so was the service. Bison Chili is very yummy. My hubby got the wing and rib platter. Very nice plate of food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Harry Buffalo is a very unique place with awesome foods.  For starters there are free video games as soon as you walk out in. Video games such as pac man and mortal kombat.  The place was very uniquely decorated. The only flaw was the slow service. It took about a half hour or even longer for our food to come out. The food I recommend is the bbq pulled pork tacos. I would come back again to play more of those awesome retro video games as well"}
{"text":"Ravishing women slinging 6 ducket pitchers and slammin' wings; meanwhile O-State pummeling Michigan on stupid-huge flat screens. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the service. The bartenders were terrible! They were too busy playing on their phones,eating and chatting with friends to notice we needed drinks. We waited for 15 mins and we had to wave one of them down to get service.
The servers seemed to be on top of their tables and were running around taking care of customers.
We ordered buffalo chicken dip and cheesy bread. Both were ok but nothing to write home about. The pita chips were really over cooked and too greasy. 
The bathroom was disgusting and out of paper towels. The floors were dirty and it looked like the toilet had been leaking making the floor wet. 
They were showing a UFC fight which was nice but it was reallllly loud. 
I would not recommend coming here until they change management and hire more competent employees."}
{"text":"After a poor first experience at the new location, I've chalked it up to new staff and working the bugs out. I've since visited 5 times and it's still disappointing. Except for free video games, everything was better at the old restaurant. It appears to have less seating, the food is significantly worse and the bowling lanes make it so loud that the bar tenders and wait staff can't even hear you. The boom boom shrimp used to be an appetizer for 3 people.....the shrimp are now 1/3 of the size and you get less of them...not even a snack for 1. Overall, I was giving them a chance. I liked the old location but this place is horribly designed and the food is a 1 out of 10 at best. If you'd like to express your concerns to the manager, it's easy to spot him...he's at the corner of the bar at all times.....head buried in a ledger notebook and a pencil...could care less about what's going on in his restaurant. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"First time here and will be a place I would return.
Food and drinks were very good and so was the bar person, Tori.
Old world charm and plenty of monitors."}
{"text":"I go to the Harry buffalo a lot and it's a good time there. If you like cheeseburgers I would recommend the bison burger it's pretty good. If I want a cheap snack I usually just order the garlic cheesy bread. On Friday and Saturday nights it can get packed but the staff is pretty good and accommodating. This is probably my favorite bar on the west end of Lakewood to watch sporting events because they have a good TV set up and there's always a good crowd of people up there to watch the game with. If you want a fun Sunday funday stop on up here and do a trash can race odds are I'll be up here and I'll do one with you haha. If I had any critiques I guess it would be that their drink specials could be better especially compared to the other bars in the area. That's just nitpicking though because you can always get a pitcher of beer for 6 or 7$ if you want to have a cheap night of drinking."}
{"text":"Harry Buffalo is with out a doubt.. your average sports bar. Chris and I stopped here before going to a Cav's game on a Friday night.. which was quick and convenient. They have a great location right by the basketball & baseball stadiums, which makes it easy to stop here for some drinks and food before going to a game.

When we arrived it was packed inside and we were told there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table for 2. After looking around, we noticed several open tables, but the hostess told us that they were going in order of names for the open tables. We luckily ended up finding some room at the bar to sit and order some drinks while we waited to be seated. The service at the bar was quick considering how busy they were- which was great for us after a 2 hour car ride! After about 20 minutes, we ended up being seated upstairs at a small high-top table.  The atmosphere was nothing special.. like I said before your average sports bar. Our service upstairs was a bit slower than we were hoping, but our waitress apologized several times and explained to us that their kitchen was backed up.

Since we were in a rush to get to the game, we ordered food and more beers right away. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and Chris had the turkey wrap. Both wraps were served with waffle fries. We both agreed that the wraps were good but nothing special at all. For future basketball games, I could see coming back here for some drinks at the bar.. but would probably try a new place for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"By far the best dining experience I've had in a long time! I stopped in with my husband a few days ago for a quick lunch in between errands. This was our first time eating here at Harry Buffalo. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, outgoing, and was able to answer all of our questions about the menu with ease (we're picky eaters). We ordered, and it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes until we got our food! It felt like the shortest wait for food, I should have timed it! Our meals were out of this world good! My husband ordered wings and chose a flavor based on the server's recommendation and was so beyond thrilled. I believe it was called Bayou- but I could be mistaken on that part. I ordered buffalo mac & cheese and simply thinking about it now makes my mouth water! I'd give 10 stars if I could. I'm super excited to have found our new spot to eat! Thank you Harry Buffalo!"}
{"text":"Although I didn't dine-in, I was a little surprised to read some of the reviews.  I can't comment on the crowd, the ambiance, or the clientele, but I can comment on the food. 

It was Fat Tuesday.  I was home alone.  I was hungry.  I live across the street.  Didn't wanna go far.  I ordered the small order of Buffalo Wings (medium) and the Philly Beef Brisket.  Wings = yummy, although they were skimpy with the celery.  Each piece was bent in a weird way and just a really small portion.  The wings themselves were quite flavorful.

The sandwich was just delicious.  Onions, mushrooms, banana peppers, mushrooms and Monterey jack/mozzarella blend on top of the tender meat.  I loved it.  

I would probably order carry-out from here again.  I am surprised this is the first time I have tried this place, after living here for almost a full year."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way home to Buffalo. It is attached to a mall. It is smaller inside, and definitely more like a bar than a restaurant. They do have some tables though. The menu (to me) wasn't anything special. Just your basic bar food (wings, burgers, sandwiches, salads). The only unique thing they brought to the table was the option to upgrade your burger to a bison patty.

The service was slow. We stopped as a quick pit stop on the road and it was well over an hour before we could leave. All we ordered was a salad and a turkey club sandwich. When I asked the waitress for her opinion on some of the different food choices, she was unable to provide me any information because she had never had any of the food. It took a while for our food to come out, and the waitress was usually no where to be found. 

The BBQ chicken salad I had was pretty good. It was in a very small bowl though so it was more difficult to eat. I like that they have waffle fries that they serve with their sandwiches, as opposed to just regular fries. The food really wasn't bad, but it also wasn't anything amazing. 

I feel like this place has potential, but I would definitely not go back after our experience. It just wasn't worth the time or the money. I would have rather just gotten a salad from a fast food restaurant than come here."}
{"text":"Been going to this bar for 8 years now and still a big fan. The service is great, bar food never disappoints (cheesy garlic bread is incredible) and it's a great place to catch a game. Have had many fundraisers there and the managers were extremely accommodating! West end of Lakewood wouldn't be equipped without The Buff!"}
{"text":"Love the boom boom shrimp. The food and service here is great. Thanks to all of the employees at the Harry Buffalo."}
{"text":"Pretty average bar that gets an extra star for it's awesome open air setup.  Drinks are standard (beers, wines, liquor) and menu is pretty large.  Nice place to watch a game or just hang out.  Friendly crowd.  Above-average service, too--we almost had to tell the server to not come back so frequently!"}
{"text":"I'm guessing this chain got their name by the way their establishments smell inside. In case you're wondering ...that smell would be comparable to hairy, smelly buffalo roaming. Yes, indeed. 

The wait for a drink was just shy of 30 minutes. No joke. We were being completely ignored in favor of the younger, skankier chicks. 

Female bartender was at least apologetic for her male ape bartender counterparts. She gave my sister \"a really good double\".  I still refuse to give more than one star -- even though that one chick was semi nice. 

NEXT!"}
{"text":"For some reason, my parents really like it here, and therefore I have eaten at this establishment 2-3 times. I definitely will be trying to convince them to go to the bar next door, as the food is better and it is way nicer. 

If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I would call Harry Buffalo a poor version of an off-brand Hooters with worse customer service, worse food, and more expensive drinks. 

The customer service is consistently bad, no matter how busy the the store is. Only women work there, and most of them are ill tempered and poor waitresses. I actually haven't had a nice waitress there who was kind or actually seemed like they wanted to be there. The food is ridiculously overpriced, and pretty poor quality as a whole. The drinks themselves are also overpriced for what you receive. I have never have a good meal there, besides that one time I got boneless wings. That was fairly decent, but it is a bar. Definitely don't get tacos. They were butt tacos. 

Also, the music is always too loud for the atmosphere this bar attempts to create. It plays shitty pop music for a country bar..? 

The arcade though is free to play, I guess, if you want to play 3 working games and look at 2 other games that don't work."}
{"text":"When u work at a bar like setting, yes games are on but you have patrons, pay attention to them.. not everyone comes here to watch the games they are here to enjoy the food. The servers totally ignored us because they were too busy watching the game and cursing at the screen. We waited 20 minutes to get someone's attention waving down people. It was ridiculous. They apologized but still, not even a drink."}
{"text":"I've stopped by on a few occasions. First time was for a party in the downstairs area. Harry Buff was very accomodating and the party was great! Good service, good deals and fun cozy space to mingle. 

Second time I stopped by was with a buddy to have a few beers. Had a few beers. Enjoyed the many televisions playing sports and Top40 simultaneously. Service at the bar is usually very good. Also enjoyed the crowd as it is probably the 2nd-place pick-up bar at that corner to ATC. 

Most recent time was WAYYY too crowded for me. Had to squirm my way from the back door all the way around to my friends on the opposite side of the bar. It was ladies night and packed. Drink specials were decent, I think a pitcher of Margaritas/Long Islands were $11 or something. Plenty of cool, hot singles hanging out, and bar service was exceptional for how busy they were. 

Will go again for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"(This review is as of the beginning of April 2016, the last time I was there)

This place used to be a favorite for my friends and I, but now we will never return.  They changed the entire menu, leaving the things that were boring and had no taste and removing some of their best items (such as the bbq potato skins).  The entire burger section of the menu shrank as well.  We still gave it a try, but we were severely disappointed.  Months ago they changed the awesome French friends to overcooked, under-seasoned waffle fries so this new change worried us.

The bison burgers were small and we couldn't tell the difference between it and hamburger, and the upcharge for bacon was crazy expensive.  We all ordered bacon on our burgers, but one of them didn't have any on them.  We told the server, but instead of apologizing and getting the bacon she rudely snapped back that we never told her it should have bacon on it.  Maybe if you could turn down the music in the background, you could here us.  There was only a few people inside when we were there, absolutely no reason for the music to be up so loud.  Well a few minutes later she returned with the bacon, and what she gave us was two extremely tiny strips - Each strip was literally only an inch long (not exaggerating).  We were charged approximately $2 for that?  She was obviously annoyed with us and after that she disappeared until we needed the bill to leave, never returning to refill our drinks.

It's such a shame, we used to love this place.  Looks like will have to find a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Yuck tacos are cold no taste small and yuck
The egg rolls are hollow over cooked.asked for take homes boxes for dogs
Waitress afforded us with one for three orders.like wake up.the oil that was used to cook egg roll was old and left after taste .the egg on the burger was over cooked and hard."}
{"text":"So we came here to play queen if hearts and have dinner. It was very busy! Had to wait over half hour for seat. But had a bar seat and a beer. Sat down and was told we have to wait to order because kitchen was slammed. The manager Steve bought us a drink and apologized. Waited over 30 min for food. I had Italian turkey melt. It was fantastic. Real turkey breast not shaved lunch meat. Husband had deluxe pizza. For not being a pizza joint he was impressed. So the wait was worth it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with the Harry Buffalo in Lakewood, this is nothing like that one. Much more like an Applebee's than a bar. They do have a nice patio with a bar, but it's in the parking lot of a mall, so, it kind of is what it is. 

A very large drink menu, a small over priced wine menu, and typical bar food. Am I running back for more? Probably not. But I won't object if a group wants to go there on a nice night."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times, but it's probably been a couple years. I forgot how fun it is. It can get a little crowded, but the music is fun and there is an overflow area downstairs. Would I want to hang out in the low ceiling-ed, overflow bar area downstairs? No. But I didn't have to and lots of people were down there seemingly having fun. 
The bar is a huge U shape and there was lots of seating around it even on a busy Saturday night. The garage doors being open was great on a warmish summer night, but let some of the smoker fumes waft in. I managed to live. 
It's totally different vibe than the one in North Olmsted, so if you are looking for that kind of place, this is not for you. Overall: fun, young Lakewood bar."}
{"text":"Good burgers & a decent beer selection.  It's cool that they serve buffalo burgers, but being from CO I opted not to pay the extra $3 for something we get everyday here.  We had the regular beef burgers, one cheese burger & one Cheesy Bacon Mushroom.  Both were really good, fries were good & not too many were you felt like you ate too much but not too small a serving that you felt jipped.  Good place to hang and watch the games in a nice neighborhood setting."}
{"text":"The Bison/Buffalo burger is delicious. The Pretzel bun, however, fell apart when I was eating my burger. Maybe the Pretzel bun should be toasted longer and without butter/margarine. The Homemade chips are good."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday with a few girls from work for happy hour! Was very impressed! And the free popcorn, bonus! Was a nice little getaway before heading home after a long day. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great wings, cold beer, and friendly staff. What more could you ask for? They have a good fish fry menu as well. If you are looking for a sponsor for your team, the Buff is the place to go."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while.  New menu, great service and every one in my party is raving about their food."}
{"text":"I did frequent this place a lot because it's down the street from my house. Today I walked in, was told to sit where ever, and was not acknowledged for 10 minutes. The severs gave the best table who entered after us were given menus and served beers. We waited a bit longer, she cleaned another table next to us. We waited 5 more minutes and then left. First time it's happened to me here. Oh well, we went down the street."}
{"text":"i want to give it 2 stars but trying to be reasonable because house salad was great and so was French onion. other then that it's pretty bad. I got grilled rebye medium. I got a well done cold steak. the melts weren't impressive. the Buffalo sauce was nasty. the sweet potatoe was meh. and mash wasn't tasty. I Wana leave 2 stars but my friends feel bad"}
{"text":"I stopped here with some friends after going to the Frozen Diamond Faceoff at Progressive Field - we were already in a sports mood, so we thought we might as well go to a sports bar! 
The first thing I noticed is that our beverages were served in flimsy plastic cups, which I thought was sketchy, even for a sports bar. 

The daily special was Buffalo Mac and Cheese; my friend and I decided that it looked pretty tasty, plus it was on sale! So the two of us decided to each get it.
We all waited an extremely long time for the food, and when it finally arrived and we dug in, my friend and I exchanged looks of terror as we ate our mac and cheese. It was the worst meal either of us had ever eaten. It was mostly sauce with very few noodles, and the sauce - my god, it was terrifying. I'm pretty sure that I could make it at home if I mixed the queso sauce from a jar with some Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce. 
The side salad wasn't so great, either.
The others in our party seemed like they enjoyed their food, but thoughts  of that mac and cheese are enough to give me nightmares today."}
{"text":"Went here after going to other places for the night at E 4th. Had a Stella with a friend and called it a night. Can't say much of the place because I only spent maybe a good hour there. I liked the idea of having the place open out but it's really dark inside. There wasn't really any music playing, just some TV's that were on. Kinda cramped by the bar area. 

I'd have to come back to give my full review. The prices for the beer weren't that bad either."}
{"text":"Food is good and comparable with the other locations.

Main complaint is the owner needs to put some money in this place!   Floor grout has been terrible for years; you can scrape the black gunk out of it!  Tiles have been broken or missing in the bar and women's room since it was Knockouts! 

Come on! You've made enough money over the years to clean this place up. 

So I hate to state the obvious, but if it's this dirty where u can see, it makes me question. what the kitchen's like?

I'd rather go to Great Northern for same food but not as worn out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on game day. Had a couple cheap beers and decided to order a buffalo burger with a side of chicken tenders. The burger was good but the tenders were amazing!!! The hot pepper buffalo sauce might e the best sauce in the city. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a number of times, and every one of them has been pretty good. As far as bar food goes (this is bar food--it's not a steakhouse as the listing says) this place is really good. Their chicken is really good and crispy, the sandwiches are great and the fries are tasty. As a bar, the drinks are slightly more expensive than other places in the area. But, in their defense, most of the other places nearby (other than Winking Lizard) aren't really that great. Harry Buffalo is one of the places in the Mentor/Painesville area that is always a pretty good bet for a good time to get some beers or watch the game."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio. Lots of outdoor seating and has cornhole (bags) for people to play. 

The burgers = delicious. You can get bison burgers for about $13 and they are fantastic. You will NOT find a bland, dry burger here. These are juicy and flavorful. Everything you want in a burger you can get right here. They also have a great selection of burgers that you can put their different selection of wings sauces on. 

So far, these are my favorite burgers in Cleveland. I have also tried The Rail in North Olmsted (too dry) and Smitty's in Elyria (flat lifeless patties - nothing special). This place takes the cake."}
{"text":"4-7pm is the happy hour M-F but I didn't see any appetizers listed. $3 blue moon craft was well worth the price. The patron silver margarita was tasty for a $9:50 price tag. The extra hot jalapeño wings 10 for $11 was so delicious with the right amount of spice but I was confused if it was a dry rub or the saucy wings that I was expecting. Extra sauce would have added to the taste. Overall an ok experience but if you want the saucy wings demand it!"}
{"text":"food is great and the price is even better, servers are nice and quick to bring drinks and menus to the tablet. great place to watch cleveland sporting events and hang with friends. one of my favorites to stop at and grab a burger and a brew!"}
{"text":"The service was not exceptional but I feel there menu makes up for it.  They have a huge menu beyond a bar food menu. They have great healthy choices and very unhealthy choices. I like the create your own burger or salad section. I tried to bison burger on a gluten free bun with steamed vegetables. It was delicious. We also ordered the buffalo spring rolls and boom boom flavored wings. The boom boom sauce was so good. Also, I the summer they build a sand pit for the kids in the middle of the restaurant. So cool !!! They have a nice patio as well and a great place to watch sports events."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend after playing some sand volleyball for a drink on a Tuesday night. The waitress was a doll and very enjoyable and knew the menu well.  We talked about the dishes and what was in each and she nailed it perfectly.  She brought me out some samples of the BBQ sauce and the pico de gallo.  BBQ sauce as okay to me, but I am from Texas so I have high standards. The pico de gallo was good, freshly made and tasty, but could use a bit more lime juice and cilantro personally. I order a fish taco for $2.50, it was really small for a taco, I never knew they made tortillas that small. The cod fish was crispy and tasty, fresh pico de gallo and a cilantro mayo on it completed it well. We also ordered a quesadilla with a BBQ chipotle chicken. It had the right amount of heat and sweetness that went together nicely. The salsa that was served with the quesadilla was lack luster and we did not eat it.  For drinks we had a pitcher of the Harry Buffalo cocktail.  This was really refreshing with chunks of fresh strawberries and canned pineapple in it.  The check was $26 for everything which was not that bad. Over all my first experience was a good one and would recommend others to try this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer at their relocated bar now on Wilson Mills Road. There used to be an overpriced hamburger joint in here. (If I recall correctly I reviewed that place and predicted its demise) 

About half the space is devoted to a mini bowling alley and vintage video games. (They need a pinball machine!). There is a cool open air bar and patio and the same great beer selection as the Highland Road locale. IF YOU DON'T GRAB A HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL THE BEER IS OVERPRICED .  The barmaids are as attentive as ever and......

..... the food is as gross and predictable as the old location. I had some wings. They were rubbery. Not at all crispy. Maybe they were boiled? They do NOT have Franks Red Hot Sauce here. Big let down for true wing eaters. Eat before you come!!!!  This place is just an SRP (Sysco Reheat Partner).

But I didn't come here counting on the food to be edible.

 I'd give three stars but there is a sickening smell throughout the bar. It reeks as if the fryer and cooking hoods are venting right into the dining space and the grease trap is under my bar stool. If you are looking for the motivation to give up fried food for a while come have a beer here. 

Still a good place to watch games and drink beer. Bartender tells me they will have the NFL ticket again in the fall.   There are so many more affordable mom and pop taverns in this area. The only thing that attracts me here is the NFL ticket. 

My bold prediction?: This joint is toast within 2 years. They must have a huge nut to crack and i don't see twenty somethings binge drinking and duck bowling paying the tab for long. This is a GREAT space in an underserved market that deserves a higher end experience."}
{"text":"Their salads are some of the best! I'm displeased that the tropical chicken salad is no longer on the menu as the menu has changed. I used to get this salad 1-2x a week. I'm also disappointed that since the menu change the salads no longer come with a pretzel stick!"}
{"text":"Came for the fish fry, not expecting anything special and anticipating a crowded, noisy bar for a Friday night meal.  We were pleasantly surprised by both the atmosphere (busy but not packed) and the food (tasty Perch).  They have a better than average draft beer selection."}
{"text":"This was a really great experience.  The staff was well trained and attentive.  The food was above par."}
{"text":"Awesome quesadillas!  Conveniently attached to the mall.  Service is always on point. Large, open space can easily accommodate bigger parties."}
{"text":"Sitting here now with all my free time decided to download this app since they were kind enough to have it posted asking us to. 

Well after 15 min I got up and got my family our own menus. After looking at them for another 15 minutes we asked if we can get a server since no one had stopped by. When the waitress got here what my wife order was on the special list was priced at $9 is now $12 because there was an event. Well in Cleveland isn't there always an event. Football basketball.  Just don't understand that. Hope the food is better than the service."}
{"text":"Ignore the map!!  The old place is in ruins, but moved by Brookpark and Great Northern Blvd (old Benigens).  Ok, now we know we were are...   Nice layed out restraunt, with huge bar area.  I got there during happy hour (4-7pm), and enjoyed half priced pint drafts, and well drinks too.  

I came for the bison burger.  It did not dissappoint!!  I went build your own burger with roasted red pepper, grilled onion, and cheddar/monterey cheese.  Awesome and perfect medium, all nice and juicy.  You can choice bun, choices are Honey Glzed, Multigrain, Pretzel Roll, Grilled Italian, and Lettuce (for those who set their guttens free).

But wait theres more..  I opted for mac & cheese instead of chips, great blend of cheeses (worth $2.49 upgrade really).  The rubs fell off bone and sweet BBQ had a little bite but awesome smoky flavor.  The fries were worth 50 cent upgrade, fresh cut and well seasoned.  The french onion soup is another gem on the menu.

The service was really good.  Never had an empty glass of water, beer, or cocktail.  At five thirty on wednesday, there were plenty of tables.  At six thirty, lots of people had shown up.  Nice location definitely another trip coming soon!!"}
{"text":"Bison burgers are always amazing!  Service stays solid and the beer selection is on point."}
{"text":"Ok I'm trying to stay positive.   I started with their promotion $5 coupon when you buy $25 gift card.   By two cards ($ 50 to cover meal), get a deal with coupon for next visit.   Its been 35 minutes and I have no visit card back,  gift cards and the\"manager\" is taking care of this.   The service is bad when buying a gift card takes talking to a manager. 

ok let's just say I'm leaving with a free meal and $25 gift card. The food was ribs and wings and over cooked boneless wings and the ribs was meat between two bones.   A really bad experience.   I had two really good ones before this.   But be careful during week."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff.  The burgers always rock.  Love the mushroom, oinion and egge! Good pizza too.."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. This is my second time
coming here and so far so good. We sat out on the very large patio. The only negative to the patio is he view, it's just main roads. If you can block that out you're golden.
The hair of the dog was amazing! So many things mixed it to one cup of deliciousness. We got the garlic cheesy bread to start....can you say cheese? It was sooo good and they piled it on good and thick. I decided to go with a steak wrap and since I don't like much on it, it was perfect with steak and cheese. One thing I like very much is they still have the pretzel bun! Yum!
The staff was fun too, they had good music playing loud and the were just dancing away.
I very much enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Note: I've only been here on weeknights towards the end of the evening and I've never had the food.   Service was fine, drinks were good, and nothing seemed out of line.  I don't really have much to say about this one.  It's a bar that's really built to make money off events at the Q.  I don't know that I would want to be here on a crowded night--seems like it wouldn't actually be fun.  But as a stop on the way home from a work commute, it's fine and dandy.  They have beer, booze, and some good people on the slow nights."}
{"text":"Fair at best. Free arcade games are the highlight. Their special was boneless \"wings\" which weren't wings at all but cut up chicken tenders. When I questioned the server, she said their boneless wings have always been like that. Very weird that white meat is substituted for wing meat. No kids menus because they didn't print any today.
I think next time I'll pass and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered there hamburger, which was overcooked and they only gave me like 5 fries so i had to order more. 

Our Server was never around and had really odd comments to us during our dinner. Never refilled our drinks too. 

Lets Just say dont try the truffle Fries!! They are gross."}
{"text":"Becky, who is a terrific server and made the visit very fun, served my friend and I as we worked Tuesday evening. The food was good. We had wings, hummus, and clam chowder and several large beers. They have wi-fi and we were able to log on and work while chatting and watching the Tribe beat the Padres. All in all a good evening."}
{"text":"First night in Cleveland and my coworker and I were attempting to find something nearby to simmer our stomachs.  We were both hungry and we needed some food, but not any food, bar food.  We walked a block from our hotel and discovered this place.

With the amazing weather that day this place was nice and relaxing to dine at.  Having the windows up afforded for an amazing breeze that day.  We decided to sit at the bar and skip all the fuss of finding a seat at a table.  We were greeted promptly by the bartender and handed menus.  We placed a quick drink order and started to look over the menu.  My eye went directly to the burger portion of the menu as it always does with bars.  

I went with the bacon BBQ burger.  This comes topped with Swiss cheese, fried onions, bacon, lettuce and tomato.  I'm not a big fan of Swiss cheese, but it worked on this sandwich.  It was a great mixture of flavors.  Each burger is traditionally beef, but you can make it a bison patty with an upcharge.  The BBQ sauce added a nice tang to the burger and the fried onions added to the crunchiness of the lettuce.  This came with a side of waffle fries.  Waffle fries are sometimes better than regular fries.  They hold more condiment of your choosing if you prefer to dip.

We were having such a good time here that after we finished our burgers we ended up sticking around for a bit.  We ordered more drinks and chatted, all while the televisions played two different baseball games.

Lastly, a tip.  Use the bathrooms after you have dined.  There is a strong aroma in them.  I know they clean in here, but yikes."}
{"text":"Another so-so Cleveland eatery this trip.  We went because the menu was enormous and it was close to Progressive Field.  It was packed, not surprising in the middle of an Indians double-header and during an OSU football game.  So...we were sent to eat upstairs.  Let me compare upstairs and downstairs for you.

Downstairs: 
-gorgeous chalkboard with beautiful beer list.  Many delicious cervezas on tap.  
-High wooden bar stools/chairs.  Nice furniture.
-Smelled normal.

Upstairs:
-on tap: Bud Light, Corona Light, Dortmunder.  You can guess what we drank.
-Funky furniture, likely to find in a cafeteria in an old folks home.
-Smelled like a musty old bar.

At least the waitress was attentive and apologetic when things got slow.  The food was fine--baby back ribs that tasted like ribs for the boyfriend, 3 bison sliders for me dressed up with bacon, chives and cheese.  Fries were waffled and acceptable.  The stand out here? Um, the mixed vegetables accompanying the ribs.  Cooked perfectly, appropriately ripe, buttered and salted.  The waitress was not lying when she said they were actually good.  If you go, try to get in downstairs.  It's probably worth your while."}
{"text":"Manager is rude. If you can't handle the influx of patrons because your selling queen of hearts tickets, then don't sell them!!"}
{"text":"Glad I stopped in!

The atmosphere is very casual and friendly.  The servers are very prompt and efficient.  Several TVs along with a good music selection mean you won't be bored.

I can't eat beef, so I went for Bison.  The Bison chili was quite spicy and very flavorful.  My Bison burger was very well made and came out nice and hot.  The bun was a fluffy type of wonderful.

This is an ideal place to catch a game or catch up with friends, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's always a fun, upbeat vibe complimented with quick and friendly service. The food is always out of this world! It's the best neighborhood bar  in town! It's definitely on the top of my favorites list! I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Harry Buffalo to grab a quick bite.  i ordered a bbq burger and have been vomiting all night. This sucks !! Don't go here"}
{"text":"We stopped in the Harry Buffalo for a Group team building lunch that consisted of 9 people. The waitress was pretty solid with bringing drink refills but she seemed a little exasperated I don't think that there was enough help there for her.

I had the buffalo chicken potbelly melt...it is a sandwich with french fries on it similar to paninis....it looked so good on the menu...but it looked poorly prepared  and hastily assembled.   Aaaand it tasted like it.  You know how a McDonald's hamburger looks so good in the commercial but in real life it's a smashed and sad looking?  same thing.  Not like I had to return it, it was still edible.  The others all had the Cleveland cheesesteak and got generally favorable reviews.  It's one of those places that if I am hungry I'd stop in and get a bite if I were in the  neighborhood but for me it's just not a destination place.  They'll do well I am sure as they cater to the sports bar crowd, lots of TVs and it is very clean and well kept. 

Tables are bussed, the bartender was attentive to her customers too.  No real gripes but just an a-ok place for me."}
{"text":"To me the Harry Buffalo has always been more of a bar for adults rather a restaurant for families.. but my kids are now Beyond a chair age and love the free video games they have in the back corner. My 10 year old will run over grab a bite of every has to eat and head back to the games.

We liked it to go here on a rainy Thursday night and it was busier than average just per my estimate. We sat on the bar side and it was rather loud but in an open concept restaurant such as this every place is rather loud so it's not a place you would go to have intimate dining and conversation.

My daughter ordered a Burger off of the kids menu and it came out exactly if she liked it. Well done. My son did boneless chicken wings and inhaled them. My wife had a fish platter I'm not a fish guy but from what I'm told it was excellent and she was a proud member of The Clean Plate Club that night. My meal was one of their chicken bowls which consisted chicken rice cilantro cabbage Tomatoes maybe some peppers ... I can't quite tell you what was in it other than I inhaled it and it was delicious. Not quite there to five stars as the server was a little distracted and we did not get the absolute best of service."}
{"text":"Went to trivia and had a horrible experience! Outside of the bartenders attitude the DJ (Mike) had incorrect answers on many of his questions: two examples - how many countries make up Europe? His answer 48 ... according to many website and Wikipedia it is 50. Another example - how many people in the 2000 General Election voted for the Conservative Party? His answer was over 10 million ... We don't have a Conservative Party! We have a Republican Party, a Democratic Party, an Independent Party, a Green Party, etc the answer should have been ZERO ... he asked the question completely wrong and instead of admitting his fault he just said that's what my company gave me!!! I understand many Conservatives vote Republican; however many Conservatives vote other parties as well!

Really?!? Time to get some me one that actually knows how to excite a crowd and give truthful answers to trivia...

Won't be back for DJ Mike - a waste!"}
{"text":"This is your typical chain/college sports bar. The wings are good here, there beer is cold. The service is not the best, I've waited as long as 15 minutes in house to order a drink in a half empty bar.

Kind of wish they had boneless wings also! If you need something fast, or your basic beer and don't mind a college crowd have at it. If your looking for something a bit more upscale this isn't your place."}
{"text":"Sat at bar, slow service on a slow Sunday afternoon.  Ordered margaritas.  First mistake, at a mostly beer establishment, but hey, that's what I wanted.  Between my friend and I we ordered 2 each.  Bill came, they charged us for Patron!  We never asked for that.  That was pretty bad of them to do.  Then my carry out order was missing main ingredients to an already $10 salad.  I was disappointed.  Ask and sometimes I don't mind top shelf,  but don't assume and expect it to be ok.  Sorry about your low tip ladies.  Had to pay for my drinks..........."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch on a nice day as they open up the doors to the street. It's also great for pre or post game meals and drinks with a location just steps from the arena. The only reason I don't give them five stars is due to occasional slow service which is mostly due to sudden rush of fans when there is a game on. Finally, they will suggest you upgrade to Buffalo meat on your order - do it!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink because it was the one place on 4th Street that wasn't crazy busy- and for good reason.  I can't remember the last time I've been treated so shabby. Happy to spend my money elsewhere guys."}
{"text":"The name alone evokes the memories of a pubescent boy in rural Ohio tending to the family herd. The burgers, on the other hand, remind me of that mislabeled can of corn in the pantry that turns out to be lima beans!

Honestly, the \"Voted Best Burger in Cleveland\" label printed on their menu is not exactly what they meant. What I think they meant to say (and would likely be more accurate) was; \"We would like to be the Best Burger in Cleveland but can't quite cut the mustard because we serve chewy flavorless bacon with cheap cheese and forgot where we put the salt so our meat couldn't ever win the contest and we think all of the people in Cleveland that did not vote for us are wrong so we print it on our menus anyway.\" The burgers are okay, but certainly not \"award winning\". The service was almost as good as the burgers. The fries, however, weren't bad at all! 

To be fair, the burgers at the Harry Buffalo (giggles) were ranked #4 in 2010, #5 in 2014, and #7 in 2015 on Cleveland's Hot List (what happened to 2011, 12, 13?) and, last I checked, none of those places are considered \"best\" unless those ahead of you actually get forced off of a cliff by some Indians! facebook.com/foodiepebbles"}
{"text":"The server was really accommodating, she checked to make sure all of the ingredients that Im allergic to  were kept out of my meal. However I am upset I could not substitute my waffle fries for a house salad with my tacos."}
{"text":"Third time there, the food is great matched by the fast and attentive service, very friendly staff including the manager checking on the tables and asking us about the food and the service was. The food's presentation is very impressive and does not look like usual bar food at other places and tastes as good as it looks. 
     The game area is very interesting after you grab a drink and while waiting for your food, just make sure not to get too immersed in your childhood pac man and Gallaga and let your food go cold, and then top off your dinner with a game of bowling. The inside seating area is really nice but I'm sticking to the comfortable patio area for the summer, unless it's raining. It's my new to go spot for grabbing a bite to eat, watch the game and have a few bears... oh yeah, and play my old favs video games."}
{"text":"Had a great time at @TheBuff for happy hour. Snagged a spot at the bar and of course I had to get the burger with the pretzel bun, so good. 

The crowd was cool and the drink prices were legit. The staff was super friendly. Parking in Lakewood is usually tricky, but I'm usually able to get a spot here pretty easily."}
{"text":"The family loves going here. We always leave happy.  Drinks are refreshing and beer choices are abundant. I always get one of their signature burgers. The staff is very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Not the greatest place ever.There's no AC so in the summer(when we went) it was very hot.Also the bathrooms.I don't think there's ventilation so it stinks.The food is also terrible.I had the Buffalo Mac and Cheese Bake.Ew.I couldn't even eat more than half of it."}
{"text":"This is a good bar to have a drink, eat some wings , and enjoy a game.  The food was pretty good.  I had a couple different flavors of wings and the kettle chips."}
{"text":"Having heard stellar things about this place's rival, Around the Corner, I made a point to visit ATC when I was visiting Lakewood.  However, I did not see that ATC was closed at 2 pm on a Saturday - blah.  Harry Buffalo was across the street so - you know the story.

I got here \"a little early\", but the bartender still served me.  They had video cameras and a crew here - I think STO was taping something here later.  I don't know.  The bartender served me once at the very beginning, and spent most of the time socializing with another group.  Not great.

I ordered wings with a hot pepper sauce.  The wings tasted burnt and hard, while I could barely taste the sauce.  What I did taste was very isolated, but tasted quite good.  I think the cooks might have been inexperienced, but that doesn't excuse them.  The wings were terribly burnt and nothing worthy of enjoying.

As a hangout, this is pretty good.  However, I personally could not stand this place as a restaurant or a bar."}
{"text":"Great place to head with friends to watch the game or to just hang out. Staff is friendly and always makes the experience at Buff an enjoyable one. Best bar in the west end of Lakewood IMO. Check it out!"}
{"text":"If you want to watch a Cavs game this is the place to do it. I really believe the best fans are here lol. The beer is cold and the servers friendly. The fans though are awesome.  They do cheers and chants and boo when appropriate lol. 

It's definitely beyond packed on game days so make sure you get there early or wear those ugly yet comfortable shoes."}
{"text":"Either this place is way over hyped, or we had a bad experience. Food was ehhh, service as below average.

We left the restaurant saying to ourselves, we should have gone somewhere else. It wasn't like we had a terrible experience, just disappointed..."}
{"text":"Wow, stopped in to try the place out and got a rude talking to. We were stopping for a bite and a drink and saw they had Queen of Hearts tickets. So while waiting for a seat we got 10 tickets to fill out. Filling out the tickets on the edge of the bar while standing we were approached by a frazzled manager that said we couldn't write on his bar top (although most everyone sitting at the bar was filling out tickets). So this manager directed us to a Smokey dark patio. We don't smoke, Needless to say we took the 30 seconds to fill out or ten tickets and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our text message came through saying our table for 9 was ready. Unfortunately, the wait staff gave our table away. They claimed that it was the fault of the new system they just got. 

A few guys in our group mentioned that the bathroom was flooded and dirty. 

Our server was attentive, and went above and beyond to make sure our drinks were filled and that we were taken care of. She suggested some entree choices for many of the first timers, including information on bison burgers. She recommended a doneness of no more than medium. Well, when I got my bison burger, it was way past medium. 

Don't expect a great dining experience. Standard pub fare and cheap drinks are the bread and butter here. If you're not overly particular, you'll have a good enough time."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great food. I love that they're always updating the menu with new seasonal items."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was under-impressed with the Harry Buffalo in Lakewood. I came here for lunch when I was apartment hunting in the area. I had the crispy buffalo chicken salad and thought it was very \"meh.\" There was a ton of lettuce and not a lot of salad toppings. The buffalo chicken was overcooked and dry. The service was decent, but definitely could've been better considering it was a weekday afternoon and there wasn't anyone in there."}
{"text":"Great wings for take out. Going across country we stayed at a friends spot in town and was recommend we check this place out. It was very busy but we decided to do take out. The bone on wings were perfectly smoked and fell off the bone!

If your in town try the wings you will love them!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is tremendous! Gina and Becca behind the bar and serving will not disappoint! Will continue coming back here!"}
{"text":"OMG! I love this place!!! We were in Cleveland to see a Cavs game and were staying at a hotel down the street; walking around on a cold, windy, rainy night we stumbled into the Harry Buffalo starving and I'm so glad we did. THIS WAS THE BEST BAR FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD; and that's really saying something as I have eaten a LOT of bar food.

We ordered an appetizer that had ribs, buffalo wings, and boneless wings - all were delicious and perfectly cooked! I know, a lot of people are saying to themselves, \"how hard is it to cook those things?\" and I would say... I have ordered these items MANY times at other bars and have been sorely disappointed.  Next I ordered the fried egg burger and my bro got the fried fish platter - my burger was PERFECTLY cooked! more importantly, all of the fixings made the burger better and fit together.  The burger was reasonably easy to eat (not totally sloppy like so many other burgers) and just the best burger I've ever had.  My brother raved about his dish also.

In addition to the awesome food, our server, Nathan was the best! He was super friendly, patient, accommodating and prompt.  We ended up talking Cleveland sports with Nathan for quite a few minutes and left with our bellies and hearts super satisfied.

If I ever am lucky enough to be back in Cleveland for another Cavs or Browns game I'll be sure to return to the Harry Buffalo.  One of the best meals I've had."}
{"text":"The service was sporadic and slow, food was not good, and the waitress forgot to bring our drinks a few times so we ended up paying our bill and leaving.

We got the feeling if you're not with the \"in\" crowd there they don't really pay attention to you, not that that would have made the food any better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local hangouts. Good food, accommodating staff, live entertainment, drinking games, PINBALL! Great place to watch the game in the afternoons or hang with friends at night."}
{"text":"We went here at 10pm on NYE with 6 kids. They were fantastic. Food was delicious. The server was very accommodating and even sang happy birthday to the teens in the group who turned 13 that day. The garlic parm wings are some of the best I ever had and were huge! The BBQ chicken pizza was  a huge hit with the kids. Only reason not 5 stars is because it was a little slow on the service. We were trying to get home to see be ball drop and did not make it due to waiting on the bill. Overall a great experience and recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the BBQ Burger it was delicious and a great price too! The staff was welcoming and nice. The environment was relaxing perfect for watching a game or just a family get together."}
{"text":"We stopped in with a group of six after a show. Few seats at the bar but several tables open. We sat at the tables and were rudely asked to move to the bar. Now leaving to find friendlier service. Don't piss off customers willing to spend money on several rounds of drinks if the place is dead at 9o'clock on a Saturday.  We will spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good bison burgers, pretzel rolls are excellent.  Menu changes frequently so it stays fresh."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  The food is great (don't order anything more than medium  unless you have a cast  iron stomach) but what makes it a great place to go is the suburb service.  It is truly amazing.  We were there at about 12:30 p.m. and it was really busy.  We were seated immediately and had our beverages within a few minutes.  There aren't a lot of servers in fact we only saw two but they were really hustling.  The server was really friendly and my husband didn't have to ask for refills on coffee - it seemed to magically appear.  I highly recommend them for service alone and you can play trivia games."}
{"text":"Seems like decent place to hang out.  We were staying downtown for conference and hubby needed to grab a bite before his next meeting.  His burger looked amazing very fresh.  I had already eaten so I can't rate anything first hand other than John the bartender was very nice."}
{"text":"Typical American food - Wings and Burgers.  Fair price, a bit noisy."}
{"text":"Went w a group of 10 on a Saturday night before a Lake Erie Monsters hockey game. Wasn't that packed. 
We started w some beers, which were tasty.  Not a big selection, but okay. 
Started w a buffalo chip and dip, which was really good. Enough spice to add flavor but definitely not spicy hot. 
I had a half rack of half priced ribs. They were fine, but too much sauce for me. Sauce was really sweet, which I like. But too much - which in combo w not super lean ribs means I spent a lot of time picking through them. (I'm a gross and picky eater)
Got a little side salad, which was what you expect. Fries were tasty, but not that crispy. Cole slaw was interesting, lotta sauce and some spicyness. 
Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese was pretty good. Decently spicy, flavorful, and unhealthy as you would expect. 
Overall decent meal"}
{"text":"I try not to give negative reviews often, but I suppose someone has to bear the burden of evening out the curve.  Fortunately, there is Harry Buffalo.  To be sure, I've never been there before, during, or after a Cavs or Indians game.  The restaurant is close to Progressive Field and The Q, so I suppose there's a decent chance it's a lively place when there's a game going on.  For a normal weekday work lunch (always at someone else's request), though, I loathe going to Harry Buffalo.  Probably the only passable thing on the menu is the buffalo burger with a pretzel bun.  It gets a pass simply on the novelty of eating (1) a burger made from a buffalo, and (2) a pretzel bun.  After that, the menu doesn't really have anything going for it, and the service is often way too slow.  There are several better places to go on East 4th for a weekday lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really despise the downtown Harry Buffalo and when this Harry Buffalo was located within Great Northern Mall, it wasn't that much better.  But, with the new location and new menus, I figured I'd give Harry Buffalo North Olmsted a try.

For one, the space is a vast improvement over the space that was inside the mall.  It's much bigger, well lit, has flat-panel televisions everywhere (at least in the bar area), and also features a smoker-friendly (I think) patio area (that was closed at the time).  As for the food, I had the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese, which is five-cheese pasta in a bowl topped with cubes of chicken served with a side of vegetables, a little cup of buffalo sauce, a little cup of blue cheese, and 2 small pieces of bread.  Not exactly the most inspired cuisine, but it was decent enough.  One is probably supposed to pour the buffalo sauce and cheese over the chicken (which, in turn, was on top of the mac n' cheese), but I opted to eat it \"deconstructed\"--dipping a cube of chicken in the sauce, add some blue cheese to the fork, and then chase that with forkful of the pasta.  Whatever works, I guess.

In the end, I think the space and environment (rather than the food) are the highlights of the restaurant.  Service was decent--about chain-restaurant standard.  I wouldn't mind doing another visit...especially with more of the Christmas Ale that also helped keep the experience pleasant..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is even allowed to be franchised as a HB. During day until about 4 you and go for good food - burgers, pizza, Mac and cheese all great. After 4 it's a different world. The \"regulars\" take up all the space at the bar . They are 35-40 yr olds who think they are still 21. Most are unemployed with alcohol issues. Bartenders flirt with them in place of making actual drinks. Flat drafts, bottled beers are okay."}
{"text":"This place is in a prime location, right next to the Q in Cleveland. This is a difficult review. It was between a 3 and 4 star experience.  The staff was nice, but they were pretty much out of everything, wings, wraps, mac and cheese..., so strike one. I ordered the bacon BBQ burger which looked great, but the meat did not have much flavor. They have a good beer and cocktail selection and the drinks were pretty good. The prices were comparable to other similar places. So based on all that and having to wait to cash out (I was even sitting at the bar). I opted to go with 3 star, which equates to OK. For me that is ultimately what that place was. Typical sports bar that did not separate itself from the pack."}
{"text":"Had the Harry Burger on regular bun with fries. My brother got a steak sandwhich, and his gf got a Mac and buffalo chicken sandwhich. Mediocre At best for taste, good waiter, and right in the entertainment center. Great place to walk around on a Saturday. We had done a lot walking, shopping and searching for food for a while so we had hit this place and one person from our party did not want to eat at Franks Brotwurst. (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) from the market."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Harry Buffalo so I called the restaurant in advance about my order and got the A-Okay to substitute a side so I went ahead and placed our order on UberEats. Unfortunately my order did not come as I had requested. When you worked all day, just got home and took your pants off so no leaving the house, you're tired and hungry, well, this experience was a disappointing one. 

I called the restaurant to see what happened and it turns out the lady I originally spoke with was not aware of the new rules where you can't substitute the waffle fries. Everyone I spoke with was very patient, friendly, and you could tell they felt bad and wanted to make things right.    I would definitely give them 5 stars for how they handled the situation.

I am however going to go with 3 stars because I did not really care for the food. I will order from them in the future though, I'd like to give them another shot and try one of their salads."}
{"text":"So, we moved here in July and this place is local and has NFL games. However, they just don't seem to grasp the concept that they are a customer service business. There is always something that makes a visit here more hassle than it's worth. You can't get this game on that TV, you can't substitute Bud Light for Budweiser on the beer special, etc. 

Yesterday, I came in with my two adult sons for lunch. The place was nearly empty. We asked the hostess for a high-top table, and she replied that there were none available. I pointed out that there was an empty high-top right behind the hostess station. Apparently, it was \"reserved\". I then asked about the high-tops at the back of the restaurant. Well, they try not to sit people there because it is \"too close to the kitchen\". So, a damn-near empty restaurant (maybe 3-4 tables taken), and we can't sit where we want. 

An hour later, as we're leaving and the place is still essentially empty, we realized that nobody had ever occupied the \"reserved\" table that we weren't allowed to sit at. 

There are lots of local places that actually appreciate customers. This place needs to become one."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Buff in Lakewood a lot and  it always had good food but often too crowded to hang out.  Then my friend told me a bigger Harry Buffalo opened in Parma Heights, so I checked it out.  Now I go there every time I'm in town.

The atmosphere is friendly, the waitstaff is very nice to look at, and they always have awesome parties on Thursday nights.  It's usually theme night, I was there before xmas and it was totally packed with people dressed up in christmas gear, there was even, suprisingly only one, santa claus dancing throughout the bar.  

The clientel ranges from 21-35yr olds, with a good mix of everyone.  There is definitely never a shortage of hot singles in there.  I'm single and I love hanging out in a place that has good looking girls and great food, that's the Harry Buff Parma Heights.  

I've been eating at Harry Buffaloes around the city for about a decade or so and I've always thought it was never just bar food, they certainly have better versions of all the originals like wings(awesome), and burgers(but they use lean, tasty bison meat),  but they also have a wide variety of stuff.  A huge menu offers healthy salads, you can build your own with a huge list of ingredients or try one of their signature ones, I like the chopped bbq chicken salad.  One of my favorite items, although its health rating is questionable, is the Stampede Buffalo Chicken Potbelly, your standard buffalo chicken sandwich with spicy chicken, blue cheese, coleslaw, and french fries, only wrapped in a fried pizza dough.  I know, at first I thought it sounded ridiculous too, but it's pretty awesome!

I do drink a lot there too, they have a great beer selection, a ton of taps at their big comfy bar.   They had a DJ the last time I was there, he was playing really good music all night.  Also, lots of tv's for all the games.  If I still lived in Cleveland, this would be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! We had two of the seasonal lunches; a steak wrap and a vinaigrette pizza and fries. Everything was better than expected. The iced tea and coffee tasted just like I'd make at home. It's a sports bar or at least they were playing sports when we were there. It wasn't crowded but it was lunch time. Our waiter was friendly fast and polite. Well definitely go back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin

I should have gotten the clue when I got there for dinner and only 6 people were in the entire place.  

The waitress/bartender apparently left her personality at home. Who runs a tab for dinner?  No one that's who.  Plus she's so clueless to know you garnish a shock top with an orange wedge.  

The website prices and menu are so out of date that the two items I came in for were not available. Taco Tuesday, nope; mini pup appetizer, nope; bison chili their signature dish....nope!!!  Stadium mustard...what's that?  Argh!!!!!!

They actually serve cheapass Barefoot wine. As their house.  No thanks.  

Luckily there was a beer special, so I had one and left.  Won't be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the place. It was warm out so they open the front garage doors.  Food was different and very good. Lovers the buffalo Mac everything!  I want a Harry B in Columbus now! Party room is smallish but has its own bar  staff was helpful and friendly.  decor is kind of retro and funky but tastefully done"}
{"text":"Quality place. The red head guy mike in there always helps me out and grabs me quality cold brews. He has a nitch for pouring the perfect beer. Also their wings are to die for. I will definitely be back here soon"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some food and have a beer. Looking to watch a game, they have plenty of TVs. Staff is extremely customer friendly! Suggest the bourbon Chicken and Shrimp or the wings. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Great Local Spot for Good food, Good Brews, and Sporting Events! The staff is knowledgable and attentive. They always make sure their guests are the number one priority and are there to have the best time! You feel at home. 
I suggest the Bison Burger on a pretzel bun...Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Bison salad.  While they dont have a patio, they slide open the sides of the bar in the summer.  Always a good time with friends.  The burgers I've tried have been great and I tried the pretzel bun.  The bun was great but fell apart before I was done eating the burger...but the burger was still very good.  They have a ton of different varieties of burgers and when a group of us go here for lunch; I havent heard one person say anything but good things about the food."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a few beers and people watch. They tazed a guy not too long ago in the parking lot. The food is actually pretty damn good and the menu is huge. A ton of beer selections. One thing...no matter how empty the bar is....they won't turn the music off and the game on the speakers. Nothing like watching the World Series and listening to Britney Spears"}
{"text":"Delicious bison burgers! Lean and scrumptious, full of flavor! Our new favorite spot! We are eating healthier and really love the bison patties and a big bowl of yummy salad. The booths are comfy, servers have been very accommodating and pleasant. There are tvs everywhere if you enjoy sports and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Was there before a Monsters Hockey game.  Got the ribs, and was surprised how good they were.  They were very tender and meaty.  Could pull the meat off the bone with a fork.  Got the spicy bbq sauce and really enjoyed it.  Great atmosphere and prices were average."}
{"text":"Went here before a game at Quicken Arena. First, dear reader, this place is a BAR. I read some of these reviews from other Yelpers and it sounds like they're going for some kind of bullshit, pastel-walled, hanging plant, daisy in the bud vase at every table joint. A bar is dark. A bar sometimes smells like burgers and wings and wood. Bar food is bar food - it should be good but if you want your $14 kobe beef burger you're in the wrong pace.  OK, I really enjoyed my wings-hot, fresh and seasoned as ordered. The nacho appetizer is a little different - the meat and cheese is on toasted pita bread triangles. Buffalo chili was hearty and good. I'm not a big beer drinker but I ordered a domestic draft and it was cold but not particularly fizzy. Order the bottled brew."}
{"text":"Came to watch the season opener for the Indians. Game playing on 9 tv's being watched by most of the patrons yet we're still listening to  music and no game audio. Asked about it twice still no game audio in the 5th inning."}
{"text":"Price to portion is to expensive compared to many other establishments. Food was great, regardless, but not for the size and price."}
{"text":"Bartender started out apologizing it was her first day. Food and service were mediocre at best. Lots of tv options good place to watch sports. 

They do have Bison burgers and chili and I've had much better experience at other Harry Buffalos, it is a unique chain and they open up the wall to the outside when the weather is right."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer before an Indians game! As an out-of-towner, it drew my friends and I in and the place was packed to watch the Buckeyes!"}
{"text":"We visited this east 4th street location this past friday before the Cavs game.  Arrived at 4:30 and were seated immediately, but they were already fairly busy with at least half the restaurant being filled at this early hour.  Atmosphere was electric as you would expect on east 4th street (one of the greatest places on earth), and the inside is pretty much your typical sports bar.  I did appreciate being able to look at the city through the giant see through garage doors.  I was a little taken back by the three \"troughs\" in the men's restroom that do not flush.  There was no toilet paper in the restroom, no stalls, or normal toilets.  If you have an \"emergency\" I guess you are S%#$ out of luck (literally).  On to more pleasant topics...  

My wife tries a Blueberry Lemonade, which was recommended by our waitress, and we both find it to be possibly the most watered down drink we have tasted in years.  It wasn't bad necessarily, just was seriously lacking any punch of flavor.  No lemon flavor.  No blueberry flavor.  Think koolade someone made half strength.  For her meal she goes with a bison burger with american cheese, ketchup, and pickles, on a gluten-free bun.  For a side she goes with a baked potato.  My wife is a \"half pint\" who has the appetite of a bird, but managed to devour this entire 1/3 pound burger.  She raved about this unique option and is craving it as we speak.  

I try the cheese pizza - light cheese, extra sauce.  The presentation was good as it arrived on a wood cutting board, but the flavor was just average.  Cheese and crust were pretty solid, but I wasn't impressed with the somewhat chunky sauce.  I managed to finish only half the pizza with it being more filling than I anticipated.  Not a bad pizza, just average.  They do have a BBQ Chicken pizza I may try in the future.

Our service was decent with our waitress, Taylor, being a little tongue tied, but very sweet and attentive.  Bill was ~$37.00 minus tip.  Four stars for great location, good atmosphere, amazing sandwich, good service, and numerous GF options."}
{"text":"Love coming here for sporting events because of the service and atmosphere. Always a good time and they always have any and all big games showing on their TV's. Can't wait to come up for the Cavs playoffs!"}
{"text":"This place is degrading and filled with underage teens. While standing waiting for my friends a random waitress came up and literally took the drink out of my hand saying I had too much, as I'm standing there not saying a word to anyone. I understand if I'm starting a fight, or asking for another drink as I'm falling over then you can refuse to serve me, but to take a drink out of my hand ? I'm 24 years old minding my own business, while there are underage teens throwing up in your bathroom and you decide to pick on me, degrading. I've served before, I always tip more than 20%, and I'm very understanding when it comes to costumer service, but what happened last night wasn't right. Hire some better staff that actually know how to deal with costumers, and leave a good impression on them for once. For being in such a prime location, you'd expect much better service, but what can you expect from a place that was previously owned by a rapist. Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"pros: big beers, friendly waitress, ok menu with limited veg friendly options (it is a buffalo restaurant i guess what should i expect?)

if you are headed to a game and want a beer, the Buff is a good stop."}
{"text":"I grudgingly came here with family since the location was close to all parties.  My expectations were very low.  Very very low.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised, all burgers came out cooked as we requested fries were very good as well. I am sceptical that the meat is bison and is as low fat as claimed cause the burger was  very juicy and decadent.  I am glad that I can raise it To 4 stars."}
{"text":"2nd time here. GREAT location near Q and Prog.  But not as crowed as 4th street.  Windows open, perfect night.  Tribe on all TVs.  Great service. Buffalo chicken mac and cheese melt is YUM!  \"Good and good for ya....!\"  prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Came in for a bite and a drink, and the food was okay, and the pricing decent. Ordered an appetizer, but never got it. No big deal the meal filled me up and she took the app off my bill so it worked out.  Big spacious place. Ordered food from here before with Uber eats and twice it was a disaster thanks to the Uber drivers. Staff was really friendly the place was pretty packed for how early it was."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great portions for price, great service. The kids meals are even awesome. My family and I absolutely love this restaurant and location. The boom boom chicken wings are just absolutely delicious! Can't wait to visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience. Staff was awesome! Torie was super nice. Would definitely recommend to to a friend."}
{"text":"Closed at this location. 
They have a sign that they have moved. 
Location has no new tenant"}
{"text":"I've been to the Harry Buffalo in Parma Heights & I really didn't care for that location so, I didn't have high hopes for this HB.

I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend & it wasn't very busy at all. The service was decent, not bad...but not the best. We ordered a pizza & surprisingly it wasn't bad! It was loaded with toppings & it was very filling. Not bad for $12. 

After 11pm, this place starts getting a little louder & seems to have a more club atmosphere in the bar area."}
{"text":"Excellent bisan burgers! Guilt free when I realized the meat is leaner than chicken. I try to make it there every couple weeks to gorge myself."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Terrible wait staff. Bartenders taking shots behind the bar, getting drunk. Decide to charge me extra for a side of hot sauce even after asking for it 3x, and waiting 15+ minutes for one of them to retrieve it from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food and service at lunch time, and it is reasonable on the wallet"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have been to this location in Lakewood many times and I am very impressed on the execution of the menu the cleanliness of the bar and the friendliness of the staff parking is a little dicey the location is not the greatest to get in and out of but the food is well worth it this is a very well run business"}
{"text":"Came in with a large group and I have to say our server was the best, she took care of our table alone and did a bang up job of it. Food could use some work to make it better. My friend ordered a prime rib medium rare and it was so over cooked that there was not even the slightest bit of pink anywhere. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I have to say that the pulling part was me pulling huge chunks of fat out of the middle of the sandwich which left for very little meat actually. Service and cocktails get a 4+ , food 1 1/2."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, great wait staff. After a long day of traveling we enjoyed it here. The food came out fast and was fresh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go in the summer for Sunday Funday, or just to watch games!!! 
Get the 'Trashcan'!!!"}
{"text":"Had the ribs here and a beer during a sports game and it was so fun! Good food and a great place to watch a game.
Plus $5 pitchers are awesome, cmon really you can't go wrong with that.

Bar is usually crowded but a booth is still pretty fun with friends. Lots of parking, close to the highway and mall, makes Harry Buff in N.O. a great spot!"}
{"text":"I want to give Harry Buffalo a four star review simply based on the fact that I've dined here multiple times in a week and it's tough to find a reasonably priced bar food and beer locale downtown. Does the food deserve a 4 star rating? Depends on your taste, I guess. If you want a gourmet meal, then go elsewhere. If you want classic comfort bar food with no thrills then this is the spot.

I will start by saying that I do not come on game nights, only when it's not too crowded. I live down the street so it's easy to plan this. I'm sure there are people who would only go there on game nights because of proximity to the Q. Service is much better when it's less crowded and I enjoy talking to many of the bartenders.

The pita nachos are by far my favorite item on the menu - cheesy sauce and melted cheese over deep fried pita with tomato, scallion, and banana pepper topping. So comforting. The sandwiches and burgers are  the other items worth trying. Burgers can be beef or bison and cooked to order. I really like the Cleveland cheesesteak sandwich - thick, crispy italian garlic bread and every bite is cheesy and with thick strips of steak. Decent wings as well, I actually prefer the boneless garlic buffalo parmesan.

Beer options are pretty limited but you can usually find a good ipa or local beer on tap. Doesn't matter though because why would you get anything aside from the cheap $3 beer of the month special :)"}
{"text":"Pretty fun place to come watch ur favorite team play on the many tv's they have. 15 different beers on tap with rotating handles. Had the bison Berger with fries. I must say was very tasty. Wifey had the ribs and Mac n cheese. Loved it!!  Would come back here soon!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, great atmosphere! The best spot to catch the game in West Lakewood! Happy hour is awesome, with $4 crafts and $5 wine from 3-6 throughout the week. Best service, from attentive, cool bartenders at the bar and quick wait staff at a table or chill booth throughout the restaurant. Food comes up quick and delicious from the kitchen. The restaurant offers killer pub grub but the menu also has healthy options, like the vegetable lettuce wraps. The menu offers unique tasty moves like the Bison burger or fried twinkles for dessert. Come up if you need a brew after a long bike ride through the Rocky River reservation, a great lunch during the work day, or want to root on the Cavs,Tribe, Browns, Buckeyes, and Bobcats with fellow fans!"}
{"text":"Not much went right during our visit. Came on a Monday for happy hour. The happy hour menu was wrong, I ordered the beer that she said was on happy hour. Then came back and said it wasn't, but explained it was the beer of month where you keep the glass, then she gave me a Labatt glass the server said they were out of them for the month. It was the 4th of the month.  Then we ordered happy hour wings, and she said the menu was wrong and it's a different type of wings. Then while waiting, the outdoor umbrella fell on me and scratched my whole back. The server apologized and the manager barely cared. He didn't offer a drink on them or anything. Was very appalled of how he handled the situation. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Great service and great bar food. Buffalo chicken dip was great. It had big chunks of grilled chicken covering the dip. The pita chips for dipping where huge! I'd recommend the Cajun ranch chicken wings which are most likely the best I've ever had. The beer was cold and tasty. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Great food. Sweet potato fries are awesome and so are the burgers. Only draw back....for the ladies....only 1 bathroom stall...yikesssss. Overall nice place and would recommend."}
{"text":"got there late (10pmish) for dinner on a Saturday. One side of the restaurant was closed so we sat in the bar side. Super loud but the beers were good. The carnitas sandwich wasn't great but the beef burger was awesome. Had little extras on our bill that wasn't warned about but other than that, a good experience."}
{"text":"Harry Buffalo - a familiar name with a familiar menu and the occasional familiar face.

PROS
*The food was better than I expected. Granted, it is bar food and I was expecting a mediocre meal, I was still pleasantly surprised by the truffle fries I got. It was light on the truffle, but the spices and dip it came with added some kick to it. They were waffle fries (not my fav, but they were okay)
*Great atmosphere for pre-gaming and sports watching. We came here on a night when the Cavs were playing at home. We came as the game-attending crowd was leaving to go to the Q, otherwise it would have been hard to get a table. The open windows and casual, Cleveland mood makes this an inviting place to grab a beer with friends before heading to a game. Not to mention, this is a great location to hit up before a Cavs or Indians game, because of it's proximity to the arena and field.

CONS
*The wings were nothing to write home about. They weren't overbreaded, which was nice, but I thought they were lacking flavor. I may have just caught them on a bad night, since it was a little crowded when we were there. Also, I was upset that 10 wings was the minimum order AND I couldn't mix flavors.
*As I mentioned above, it's a popular place to attend before games, so it can get crowded. Any time I've come during a peak hour, the service lacks hospitality and attentiveness, but I suppose with good reason. 

BOTTOM LINE
Grab a bite to eat or beer to drink to celebrate Cleveland sports, just make sure to get there early enough to grab a seat or late enough so the departing, game-attending crowd creates some space."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I say never again. Why do I do it?! I had a coupon for a free app for signing up for the email list. 

I just posted pics of the food we ordered, the chicken tenders were so small, and looked like reject pieces. Did we get such measly, and tough chicken because we had a free app coupon? Or do they always serve sub par and feel comfortable with it?"}
{"text":"I am a snob of European origin and I am not afraid to admit it. I love cloth napkins, scented candles, fancy silverware and foreign music. Also wine in tall glasses and cheese with unpronounceable names. I want my appetizer to confuse me and then amuse me. I want some anorexic girl with beautiful voice to sing me about bridges, skies and fatal attractions and then her look-alike to serve me fried chicken livers. That's my idea of fun.
To be honest american bars usually give me migraine and suicidal ideation with their cheap dull alcohol, loud music and dudes in browns jerseys asking me if all Russia is Siberia and if I am a mail-order bride. Shoot me.
But this one was not so bad.  Generous portions, fresh lettuce, and not so bad wine. 
Plus the lack of window is kind of nice of idea of retreat in case I confuse again what the hell Browns play ( football? baseball?) and some furious fans decide to beat me up - I can just step out of the window into the night. 
So next time I decide to visit America, I am going to step out of my little Euroland and go there. To have some chicken wings and drink bud light. 
Well everything except bud light, that's pushing it. I am even going to invest into a hoodie and my boyfriend will wear a browns baseball hat. 
Simply because we love adventures and tourism."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The bar back, Max is one of a kind and truly knows how to take care of the customers. The staff is great treats us like we're family every time we walk in. Highly recommend stopping in to see and enjoy the atmosphere here"}
{"text":"Nice local bar with a good selection of beers and some decent food as well. Service was good on a quiet Sunday evening, and the refreshing beers went down well. Will be back."}
{"text":"Yikes. It was an awful visit. It was Or first time being there and we felt like it was a horrible episode of bar rescue. We waited a couple of minutes to be seated, while we were waiting the manager took a shot of alcohol at the bar. He didn't acknowledge us or even greet us. The restaurant looked pretty empty. There were like 6 tables there, two servers, and one bartender. They seemed pretty short handed. The hostess sat us at a booth and the table felt dirty and disgusting. She came back and took our drink order, she seemed pretty frazzled because she had like 4 tables. We put in our drink orders, my husband and I got a corona and lime, the limes were old. We ordered the boom boom shrimp and the pretzel nachos. It took about ten minutes for our appetizers. When we finally got them, there was a long dark curly hair on our shrimp. We sent it back and cancelled our order. The server was very apologetic. The manager didn't come to apologize, he just stayed in the kitchen, avoided eye contact. It was ridiculous. I'll never take my family there again."}
{"text":"We came to watch for game 5 of the Eastern conference finals. We had a waiter (Anna) that was great. This location can naturally be over run but otherwise they take very good care of customers."}
{"text":"Randomly ate at this place because we thought the name was funny.  There were no tables for our party of 8, so they let us crash a private party in the back.  Great service all around, and the food was all delicious.  I split a bison burger and a sweet buffalo chicken melt with a side of pretzel cheese bites.  All of it was really, really good, and I'm not usually one for pub food."}
{"text":"Came here to grab lunch and had the worst experience ever. There was a group of guys that were over served with alcohol, who made numerous racist/comments/jokes. We are of a minority and did not appreciate it those comments. We felt like we were back in the 1800's in south of the Mason-Dixon Line.  What made the situation worse is the manager/bar tender was going along with it the whole time. You would think being a manager of a place you wouldn't allow that because you want all your customers to feel comfortable. This is not a way to run a business, and I would never recommend this place to anyone. PS If I was the owner of this establishment I would not leave this particular manager in charge ever again. Date of experience: 4/29/13 @ 3:00pm"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there after a concert last week and the service was horrible. The gray haired bartender was rude and offensive. One of my friends had too much to drink and was trying to get another drink so I turned to the bartender and signaled him not to serve my friend. The bartender yelled back at me \"Really? I've been doing this for 20 years you don't think I f**kin know he shouldn't be served\". I thought I was doing the right thing for the bar and my friend but this bartender made me feel like an embarassed idiot. I will NEVER RETURN to this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. The last time I visited, the point of the name was that they served buffalo meat steaks and burgers. Apparently, it is all just a name now.  

I went to meet with friends on a Sunday early evening. There were only some guys at the bar, the rest of the place was empty. That being the case, it still took ages for a waitress to get my drink order, and the people I was meeting, said they ordered their food ages ago and were still waiting. 

I got the Buffalo Chicken Mac & cheese sandwich, and my son got a steak.  My sandwich was actually very good. Creamy mac & cheese, nice spice, and the chicken was actually tenders, not chopped up in the mac like I thought it would be.  The fries are the fresh cut kind, and were tasty. My son's steak, on the other hand was awful.  The menu states it is a marinated steak. He said it was bland, I tried a piece, and it had NO flavor. None. I don't think it was even seasoned with just salt and pepper. The broccoli was steamed to death & had no flavor either. He said his potato was good. 
It took forever to find a waitress to get our check, and to pay the bill.
 
Since the sandwich was good, we are going to try it again & just keep to sandwiches and apps. I will let you know how that goes."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat there for more than ten minutes and had no one come ask me for a drink and they weren't even busy"}
{"text":"So i went here again. This time it was awful. The food was good but the atmosphere was wretched. I loathe DJ's. They had the worst DJ i have ever heard. The music was so loud i could not even hear my friend. Not only was the music way too loud, it was horrible music too. I asked our waitress if they can lower the volume, it got louder. Our waitress said \"well we paid him $400 to be here\" i offered $500 for him to go away, So awesome management skills. I could not waIt to leave this hell hole."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I discovered they also participate in UberEATS. 

Im a huge fan of the BBQ ribs. Any other meat related bit I would avoid."}
{"text":"The Harry Buffalo in Elyria is pretty good for the most part. The food has always been pretty good and the restaurant itself is nice. The wait staff could use some improvement (asked for another minute to look over the menu and them not returning for 10-15 minutes or more and stuff like forgetting that you are even there after being first sat at a table). Overall a good restaurant and I plan on eating there again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite stomping ground in Lakewood. The bartenders there are the best! Always personable and on top of things. The manager and assistant manager are always there making sure everyone is enjoying their time and/or meals. The bar has a pretty good set up too! Plenty of booths for people who want to sit down to eat, the U-shaped bar makes a good amount of bar seats and for socializing, and a basement with an additional bar that is used when it gets busy or can be rented out for fundraisers/private parties. If you're looking to catch a game they have plenty of big screen TVs and always have the game sound on! 

You can never go wrong with their food. If you're looking for a quick bite or a full meal they have a good selection to choose from. Their Garlic Cheesy bread is like heaven in your mouth! Of course their wings and burgers are good, but I'm also a big fan of their Buffalo Mac and Cheese pizza and their Thai Cashew Bowl. They usually have a monthly pitcher for $6 for all you beer drinkers. 

PS if you're a fan of Sunday Funday, then this place is a must! Thunderstruck is usually played and is a blast! We always seem to make friends with other people there on Sundays because everyone is socializing with each other."}
{"text":"This place is about as good as it gets in downtown Cleveland.  It's the diamond in the rough.  You name it the wings, the buffalo burger, sweet potato fries, buffalo wrap - there all good.  It's better than your average bar food, in a good location (for cleveland)."}
{"text":"Love loveeee the salmon! Laid back atmosphere and friendly service. This is one of my favorite go-to's for an after-work beer, no to mention a great spot to watch the game."}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Wings were sub par to say the least. Good place to hang before the game."}
{"text":"Working less than a two-minute drive away, this is a somewhat regular Happy Hour destination for my colleagues and me.  We are especially fond of Wednesday Trivia, where we've been able to reduce our total expenditures by about 10-15% on average with our winnings.

The Buf certainly has good Buffalo burgers.  And their pizza is pretty damned good, too.  Their pita nachos are a mainstay at our table, and they're delectable.

They tend to hire for looks more than ability, although you do run across the occasional attractive and capable server, but I've never had a BAD server.  One in particular has usually done a great job of handling our table of 8-10, separating checks, etc.

Their menu changes a lot which is upsetting.  I also hate the menus that are overrun with advertising.  I get it (I'm in marketing), but I still hate it.

Occasionally, even at a cheap chain sports bar, I want a decent drink.  You are not going to get a good grown-up drink here without getting specific with the bartender.  At least, that's been my experience.  For bonus points during trivia, I asked for a shot of Wild Turkey, and it came out chilled and watered down.  I ordered a T&T once and got Tanqueray and soda.  Was told once they had Christmas Ale in stock, ordered a pint, and it was Grassroots Ale, GLBC's single biggest screwup in their history.

Stick to beer or sports bar style drinks and you'll be fine.  The food is good to very good for what it is."}
{"text":"Burgers were not bad. I had the bison burger with a pretzel bun and a few other things added in. Mine came with home made chips. Overall everything was tasty, but really nothing special. The service was good, time to prep the food was fine. No problems... Overall a very average restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been there twice for dinner.  Both times, the food was good, but took a long time to get, even though they weren't busy.  If you're not in a hurry, than this is a decent place to have a couple of beers and something to eat."}
{"text":"My first time at Harry Buffalo's was the last game of the world series. It was insanely crowded as was every restaurant in the city. I had a lovely waitress who was obviously very busy. After I received my delicious food, I waited five or so minutes for anyone to come by but I had no luck. 
So I asked a hostess who was standing right in front of me if she could just grab me a few napkins. She proceeded to roll her eyes at me and then walked back to the podium, where she chit chatted with another employee in plain sight of my table. Everyone I was with noticed and it was a little embarrassing. She then walked past our table multiple times after I had asked her for help and still would not even point a waitress in my direction. 
I paid for my order and just left. Poor staff members can really change the atmosphere of a restaurant. The food was good, but its not worth it if you're going to be treated like shit. SHE IS TALL, THIN AND HAD LONG BLONDE HAIR. OH, AND SHE'S RUDE AS FUCK.
I ended up calling later on and speaking to a manager about it. He said he'd have a staff meeting to address issues like this, but having a meeting without singling the culprit out is not an effective way to change that specific persons bad behavior. I hope that when this meeting takes place she knows that SHE IS THE REASON THE ISSUE IS BEING ADDRESSED."}
{"text":"We are upgrading our rating due to consistency of good food and service.  We usually go for the specials.  The pizza is excellent with a fresh crust. We continue to love the salad with optional salmon.   The salmon is usually better than that costing 3 times as much at restaurants."}
{"text":"We play trivia here on Tuesdays quite often.  Decent for that, but the food is pretty consistent as well.  Very good Buffalo burger and tacos on taco night.  They usually have a deal going for every week day.  Fairly decent value and pretty good staff.  I know this sounds like a 3 star review, but for what this place is I have to give them the round up.  You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a sports bar with good service and value."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar, so don't expect frills. The service was bad, there was a lot of attitude coming from a waitstaff who acted like they didn't want to be there. I had the wings which were saucy and spicy (good combo) and they come with a side of waffle fries that actually rivaled Chik Fil-A. Another person in my party had the burger and said it was quite tasty. They have a good beer selection. It was pretty slow, I'm sure during basketball season it's a great spot for a pregame meal and beer.

Please work on your servers' attitudes, that goes miles with the customer experience."}
{"text":"Could I love this place anymore than I already do???????   First time there and I ordered the most perfect lunch.   Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese pizza.   Need I say yummy to the 10th degree?   Super creamy Mac and cheese mixed with buffalo chicken with just the right amount of heat, placed on pizza crust, and then topped with cheese.   I don't want to know how many calories, but it was worth every one.   Took 3 pieces home for the next day.  My husband had the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese sandwich.  Nice piece of chicken, again spiced perfectly, topped with the same creamy Mac and cheese and served on a fresh bun.   It was huge, so he only ate half, but loved it as much as I loved mine.

We are new to the area and look forward to returning.  Our server was terrific and anticipated all our needs before we even had to ask."}
{"text":"Food is very good, especially the wings and bison burger. Super attentive staff no matter how packed the place is. Have played on teams sponsored by the buf and always look forward to an ice cold pitcher of beer after."}
{"text":"Again....great bison burger (albeit a little gamey this time). Sweet potato fries were great as well."}
{"text":"Crowded, loud, stressful.
Are two bathroom stalls enough?
Flat beer makes me sad.  

Neon Nascar lights.
Stop peddling Jello shots! 
Did someone break wind?"}
{"text":"Really disappointed!
Ordered HENNY CHICKEN 3 piece. Under the delicious skin was a layer of dried & tuff meat....Hoooorrribble! 
HENNY CHICKEN is suppose to be crispy on the outside & moist in the middle. PRESSURE COOKED. Nope not this chicken.
If you notice in the picture, it clearly shows black remnants from I'm pretty sure OLD OR Dirty pressure cooker or grease"}
{"text":"I went into Harry buffalo on taco day. It was my first time in and I'm going to have to say it was at best average. The bartender was good but the amount of time it took to bring out 5 tacos for our group was a bit much. Plus the fries and tacos were both brought out a little to cold for my liking. All in all I'll have to say it's your average bar food based on the tacos I ate and the service of one group of workers. I will definitely go back and give them another chance and further explore there menu."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.....service was ok for a weekday night before a Tribe game."}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for seating after we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. Others who came in later were seated before us and the hostesses stared at us for that duration of time and didn't apologize or inform us of an adjusted time. This does not speak for the whole franchise, but our experience was highly unpleasant and we will not be going back!"}
{"text":"This is one of probably a dozen or more pubs that have opened up in the Gateway District of Cleveland around the athletic centers...roughly one or two blocks from Progressive Field (home of the MLB Indians) and the Quicken Loans Arena (home of the NBA Cavaliers). That said, this is also a nice pub house. The large picture windows open up and in good weather you have the breeze floating through on the tables that are in the windows. Two sides to this pub...and each one has a bar that can serve it up. The Harry Buffalo is a franchise operation with many outlets and this is a perfectly situated one. 

We had 3 lbs of wings (these were very nice and tasty...if you got the sauces on the side you'd notice that there was a nice flavor even without saucing it up) and a buffalo chicken mac n' cheese bake (very nice...tasty and just the right amount of zing). We finished with the plainly named cookie which belies its goodness (this was more like a fresh brownie cooked right in an individual pan and served with a scoop of ice cream and two sauces - you eat it right out of the pan)...this was decadent. 

Beer flows here...many on tap and loads in bottle. Whatever you drink you'll undoubtedly find it here. We were here the night they had the RNC debate in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans Center so there were tons of suits and security around...made for an interesting event. All in all a good pic when your are looking for a brew or a bite to eat on the way to the Indians or Cavs game (or a debate)."}
{"text":"I visited Harry Buffalo on a Thursday night. The place was fairly busy which wasn't a surprise considering it was Thirsty Thursday. It took awhile before the bartender served us which is why I'm leaving 4 out of 5 stars. The patio area is great. It is equipped with a full bar and a lot of seating. The patio is perfect for drinking outside on nice days and nights."}
{"text":"When it's good, it's great! Even when it's bad it's still a great fun bar in a great city! This place earns a good solid 4 star review. Our last visit was a Friday afternoon before a tribe game. The wings and beer here are always good. We tried some items this time around that may be newer to their menu and everything was great. Always makes a great stop for a cold draft, and lunch!"}
{"text":"First time going here.  My parents and I don't get up here to this are that often.  Decided to come here for lunch. It was pretty quiet since they had only opened a half hour before we got there. Décor was nice.  Not too flashy or anything.

We did have to ask about what non-alcoholic drinks they had because it's not on their menu or their drinks book.  They did have some unique things on their menu like sesame chicken tacos and Persian pork tacos.  At least I have seen anything like them before.  My dad decided on French onion soup and a bbq bison burger.  My mom decided to have a buffalo chicken potbelly sandwich.  I decided on their buffalo chicken mac'n'cheese melt.  My dad loved the soup.  He had ordered medium for his burger and it came out almost well done, but he said it was very juicy and very tasty.  He loved it.  My mom enjoyed her sandwich.  I loved my sandwich.  The buffalo sauce was a little on the vinegary side, but the heat was not overpowering like some I have had in the past.  It was not over handed on the sauce either.  It was just the right amount.  I loved the fries that came with it as well.  They were hot and crunchy and not salty at all.

Our waitress always made sure our drinks were full without having to ask which is a major plus for me.  She was very friendly.  She was awesome.  We all wished there was one closer to where we live."}
{"text":"We loved Harry Buffalo. Service was awesome. Our waitress never let our cups past half empty. She smiled and looked like she was happy to see us. Good was great. Pretzel Sticks with cheese was our choice for appetizers and it was delicious. Came out pretty quick. I got the BBQ bacon burger- cooked perfect. Bun wasn't soggy and everything tasted fresh. My Blue Moon was delicious as well :) 
Only negative was the way they sat people. Didn't take names- and I think we may have cut someone off on accident and got ppl mad. Oops. But I was overall impressed with Harry Buffalo!"}
{"text":"First of all we had 3 bugs flying above our table, the table was sticky, the bathroom had flies, food sounded amazing but didn't come out that way. Pita nachos, burger, and wings were good. Waitress was ok. Appeared to not care. Brought our appetizers with our food.  Was less then empathetic when we told her a plate was unetable."}
{"text":"A solid 3 star place is a good way to describe this place. This is where my mother in law wanted to come for Mother's Day so this is where we took her. My husband and I both got the buffalo chicken and Mac and cheese sandwich and I was more impressed than I thought I would be. The bread was like garlic toast and the Mac was creamy and the chicken was tender and the sauce was solid. The fries were even pretty good with some kind of seasoning on them that I couldn't pin point. My husband got the cole slaw and that was different but tasty as well. 

The service wasn't great, and for not being busy that is hard to overlook. There really wasn't anything terrible nor anything terrific here. Would I come back? Sure. But I can't see a reason for me to drive all the way back here without a good reason.

Oh and a great deal on Mother's Day, moms eat free and get a $10 gift card for next time. So that was worth it alone."}
{"text":"Tried to come here again on a Sunday.  The Cavs were playing so the place was pretty busy.  The TVs were SO LOUD that we literally turned and walked out.  When we told the hostess why we were leaving she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"ok\".  Turning away a 6-top of drinkers is just dumb.  By the other reviews on this place I can see they obviously don't give a damn about what people (paying customers) think.  Whomever is the store manager is should be exiled to an island where all he/she hears is loud, blasting, crappy, pop-country and sporting events.  I know this is a corporate place and they have to read these reviews.  The people have spoken....and this particular Harry Buffalo eats ass..."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night briefly.  Its your typical Lakewood bar..guys who still think theyer on the football team (even though theyre 30) and girls who go for that type..lol.  It is its own little microcosm..hillarious.  It was packed and servers were quick with a beer.  The manager was a super cool dude too..chatted with him for a bit.  Bathrooms are downstairs..so be careful after your 10 jeager bomb BRO!  All in all its not my crowd but Ive been to wayyyyy more annoying bars!  Hipster bars are worse.."}
{"text":"Came here for the Tuesday taco deals.  I looked online and for the specials and of course the server never mentioned anything about them when she came to my table. Yet another  shyster trying to upsell me.  Why have deals on your website or Scene magazine and not tell the average Joe when they sit down?  This is all too common in places now.  The server chick Rebecca was even training someone and had the \"drop and run\" mantality of serving.  How she can be entrusted to show a new server the ropes is beyond me.  Could not be more unpersonable.  If this is Harry Buffalo's standards then the place is as doomed as sheep in the backwoods of West Virginia.   Wanted to tell the trainee to run away as fast as possible but she looked like a deer in headlights.  Have been to a few locations now (lakewood, n. olmstead, downtown) and honestly the Parma Hts one is the only one I can stand the servers.  This location had by far the most unfriendly and mopey looking servers of the lot.  I dont need my ass kissed but I just want someone who even gives a crap enough to make money.  This place will close like the fake Irish bar, Bennigans did soon enough..  Hopefully the Lido is looking for a new mall location further West?!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are so juicy and cooked perfectly, good prices and very convenient hours!!"}
{"text":"We went to Harry Buffalo for lunch on New Years Day. It wasn't too busy (since most people were probably still in bed). We were seated near the window, and unfortunately that meant that it was really cold at our table, almost uncomfortably cold. Anyways, I ordered a burger there with fries. When I ordered the burger, the waitress asked us whether we wanted chips or fries, and failed to mention the fries cost extra, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. That being said, our food was delicious and the fries (waffle fries) were perfectly crisp. The service was just mediocre but not enough to really damper our visit."}
{"text":"Great food as always.   Burgers were spectacular. Service was a little slower and less attentive than normal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sports bar with OK food, this place is fine.  Nothing special, but it was OK.  I had the ribs, my wife had the shrimp tacos, and both were good.  The cole slaw with the ribs was actually pretty good, but the baked potato was just OK.  My wife liked her tacos, though there wasn't a lot of shrimp on them.

I will warn you that the ribs are either available with a sweet or spicy sauce and the spicy is very spicy.

The wait-staff was also OK, pleasant, but a little on the inattentive side.

As I said, I wouldn't rush back, but not terrible.  Just not special."}
{"text":"Great place to go for yummy food. And they still have the Herd Burger.  Start off with the Cheese Curds. You won't be disappointed. I Love sitting on the patio, it's beautiful and enclosed during winter. The $3.00 Bloody Mary's are really good too."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Cleveland. Decent bar atmosphere. Still a kid friendly joint which is always a score in my book. 
Started off with garlic parm buffalo wings. Hmmmmm no garlic. Barely any parm. And sone of the wings were tinier than my pinky. I mean cone on dont serve me that. Very disappointed in this selection
Then i ordered one of their staple items so heres a chance for redemption. A half lb bacon bison burger. Uh oh. At first inspection ....ONE PIECE OF BACON?!?!  Never good in my book...bacon makes tge world go round do t ya knnow??
Anyways i was prepared for disaster when after the  first bite, redemption entered my mouth. One of tge best burgers ever. Bison lean but still juicy and soooooo flavorful. Extremely pleased with this
Allin all service was good snd others in my party were pleased. So i would come back if i had to but wouldnt particularly look for this place"}
{"text":"We stopped for a beer and something to eat and we were very disappointed. The beers we not very cold and the French fries were terrible. Not only were they cold, but they were hard. They must have tried to reheat left overs. Might be tough to get us to go back."}
{"text":"Ah, the Buf.  Your standard, run of the mill, chain-ish sports bar.  There are tvs everywhere and blasting music.  If you're there on a particularly good day, you can watch 80's videos and a half a dozen different sporting events.

The nicest feature of this bar is the patio.  Plenty of seats...more tvs...cornhole...sometimes beer pong.  It's a great place to hang out in the summer.  I can't say that I've been overly impressed by the food, but the pizza is pretty good and they offer a couple vegetarian options (like a wrap, salads, etc.).  And most importantly, they always serve good booze!"}
{"text":"Bison burger was good.  Sub'd a salad and it was over dressed but good.  Staff is friendly.

The place feels like a bar / pub.  I am not sure I would recommend this place for kids in the evening.  Maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"Was going to give one star but I have a conscious and felt bad. Nice location for a post game spot. They have alcohol and terrible service. Never really had a great time here but I appreciate what they're trying to do. One of the few bars in the area (cough * east 4th *) open late so that's a perk. But like I said. Never really impressed."}
{"text":"Well this is the 2nd time the wife and I have stopped in here in the past month.  We enjoy playing NTN trivia and once again it was the same old story.  They have 20 game boards and only one of them works.  Yet they continue to do nothing about it even though they pay thousands of dollars for the service.  It's sad too as BW3 is the only other bar in the area with trivia.  It could be a huge drawing point for them.

The barmaid was very efficient and very sweet so that was a positive.  I ordered a bison burger to go.  They handed a takeout order to her and she passed it on to me.  Got home tonight and I got two orders of wings - unbelievable.  We will be back if they ever get their act together.  I really hope they do.  The place has so much potential."}
{"text":"Nice bartenders, good drinks, ok atmosphere, lame music though, not many chicks, there was like 4 dude for every chick there.But the drinks are pretty good priced and they dont skimp on the alcohol. Just need a dj or a better play list. Good spot to watch sports events."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots.   The best potato soup in town with a side salad. We also like the rice bowls.   I would highly recommend.  The service is friendly, fast and attentive.  Nice outdoor patio for good weather days.  Worth trying!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and great sports bar. They did run out of a lot of beer because it was a busy Saturday. The medium wing sauce isn't spicy and not the best wings. Great location and staff though."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Service is decent. But the portions for the price is horrible... NEVER order takeout."}
{"text":"It is a very blah restaurant. The service at the Highland Heights location is slow and some of the bartenders are rude. As a chain, they keep shrinking the menu. It seems the priority is the new fried chicken. I have been there numerous times and the food I ordered was decent. However, they tend to try and nickle and dime you to death. Last time I went I did the \"build your own burger\". I substituted chicken and picked some of the basic toppings and cheese. I asked to get some bbq sauce on the sandwich and wanted a steamed vegetable instead of french fries. When the bill came, I was charged $1.00 extra for the vegetables and $.50 for bbq sauce. It also advertises as a sports bar, but it is not a good location to watch sports. All the tvs are at angles to the tables, making it uncomfortable to watch. Sitting at the bar is no better, as there is one 50 inch tv on the end of the bar and for all the seats on the sides of the bar have to watch on a few 22 inch tvs. Much better off going to Winking Lizard, especially when the new one in Mayfield Heights opens"}
{"text":"A gargantuan severed buffalo head, periodically decorated for holidays and/or sporting events, holds court over the open air expanse of the main dining room. The servers glide about all in black, smiling at the madding lunch crowd. There are all the expected cheap beer specials, but what really surprises is the black bean burger: crispy and light and served on a delicately buttered roll--it is more or less the antithesis of the pile of sauce-saturated wings or ground chuck artery clogger one might expect to find here paired with a PBR dispensing helmet...that is until one loads it up with grilled onion, egg, and avocado. These are necessary additions, however, bolstering the sandwich's natural richness, and in keeping with the spirit on things. Make no mistake, HB is a bar designed for ravenous fans of all manner of sport and debauchery. The other day, a group by the window watched a fifteen foot Budweiser bottle balloon inflate and waiver in a fry-oil scented breeze across the narrow street to the Q, the consensus being that here was a sentinel implemented to keep watch and give the occasional belch of blessing. Salute the bottle, and the ol' shaggy noggin on the wall that looks like Grendel's distant cousin (crossbred with Sasquatch perhaps, to enhance its heavy American charm). Dig into your veggie burger or perhaps your savagely named and evidently super-juicy \"motherclucker\" and prepare to soon be bemoaning and/or praising the work of muscular men on the televisions."}
{"text":"I always love hanging out at \"the Buff\". The staff is always so friendly, the food is amazing and the drinks keep on coming. I really enjoy watching sporting events there. What bugs me more than anything is when places don't play the sound for a big Buckeyes game. You won't have that problem here. Great TVs  and the sound loud enough for everyone to hear it. If you're lucky enough to be there for a round of \"Thunderstruck\" you will see why this is one of my favorite places in the area."}
{"text":"Poor service. We went here as a registered stop for a bar crawl. They had many open tables, both upstairs and down, but asked us to move from open tables for patrons ordering food after 8pm. We all ordered one drink from the bar and left.  Disappointing that we received worse service here than Buffalo Wild Wings"}
{"text":"Came here to get a bite to eat for lunch. The waitress was nice and always checked on us. The location is great for people that work downtown. The place was clean, no food on the ground etc. we seated ourselves as the sign stated. I got something small because I wasn't really hungry. They have lunch specials. I got a soup and a baked potato because I can't eat lettuce so soup and salad was not an option for me. My friend got chicken fingers. Mine ended up costing more because I didn't get a \"lunch special\" because I'm allergic to lettuce. I do wish there was a fruit salad or something for those to substitute salads with for those of us that can't eat lettuce. Either way the soup was amazing. I recommend the French onion 100%. It was so good. Onions cooked perfect and broth was awesome and not oily like some French onion soups. The baked potato was great as well. Kinda small but I ate it all. My friends chicken fingers were cooked perfectly and came with a wing sauce. The waitress was really sweet and always checked on us. 
Fluffy people get tables as booths are not fluffy people friendly. High tops are tough for vertically challenged fluffy people like me. But I made it! =)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. We went here for a drink & dinner. I ordered buffalo mac & cheese sandwich. I like the idea of it... it would've been great if only the chicken in it was fresh. The buffalo chicken has no buffalo sauce taste to it & was dry & hard. 
Perhaps a good place to drink but, not to eat ..."}
{"text":"First visit here. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes waiting to order, watching two young bartenders texting on their phones. The never looked up. I left after 10 min without ordering, because in no restaurant anywhere is this poor level of service acceptable."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Not many places around here where you can eat a bison burger, so this place is always a go-to! I love coming here on UFC nights for the atmosphere and drinks! Friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"Wow! I was very disappointed with the service and the food. The atmosphere as well.  My family was half way through their meal before I was given we silverware to enjoy my rotten JoJo's. They were seeping a black fluid. Manager was requested and found it was no big deal. I was told they were low on silverware and she would bring me plasticware. Upon receiving our bill we were over charged. The manager was rude. Drunk guests were allowed to enjoy their evening, but not us. We will never go back"}
{"text":"My softball team this summer was sponsored by Harry Buffalo.  We always came here after every game and I've always been really happy with their service.  Since they are our sponsor, we get 5 pitchers of FREE beer after every game.  Score!  Additionally their food is excellent if you're into fried greasy deliciousness.  Fried Provolone... helloooo I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"Arrived at bar waited 8 min to get a drink on a Monday night. Are u kidding me 
Server ( female) with hat on backwards 
Nice touch"}
{"text":"I like Harry Buffalo, partly because I live in the neighborhood but partly because it's just a good time. Sometimes it's a little too crowded for my liking but there are great drink specials all the time that keep me coming back. 

Since it's a sports bar there's a million TV's playing sports on them which isn't exactly my favorite BUT with that said, sports on TV attract cute guys and cute guys attract me, am I right or am I right, ladies?

Anyways, bottom line, even when this place is really busy, the service behind the bar is still exceptional, there's cheap drink specials all the time (I think Thursday is ladies night and that's the best special night)... there's usually a great crowd hanging out here of 20-somethings and it's close to home. Can't really ask for more than that. If you're looking for somewhere cool to go, Harry Buffalo and ATC are where it's at!"}
{"text":"This is probably the only place in Cleveland where you'll be able to get a buffalo burger.  Since buffalo has a lower percentage of fat in the meat, it is very easy to get a dry burger, which unfortunately was the experience here.  My burger was on a pretzel bun, and while I appreciate the unique experience of eating burger and pretzel, the bun was swimming with grease.  It was as if the fat/grease from the burger had all diffused into the neighboring territory of the bun, since we had dry burger and way too greasy bun.  

Service was mediocre.  The waitress came back multiple times after we had given her our orders to reconfirm what we had gotten, because she had forgotten what we had told her.  Maybe she was new and was getting the hang of things, but all we had ordered were 2 burgers (with no alterations from the description on the menu) and 2 diet cokes.  We were also the only people ordering anything at the restaurant at the time (with a total clientele of 3 people when we actually walked into the restaurant)."}
{"text":"Was upstairs for a private event.  The staff was very friendly and efficient.  The food they catered was very good and plenty of it"}
{"text":"Great location, good service and  outstanding service!  Arrived in Cleveland and ate lunch while waiting to check into our hotel.  It's right across from Quicken Arena and the Residence Inn.  I had the BBQ chicken salad and my husband had a cheeseburger. Tasty and good portion size - not huge servings.  If its a nice day there are large windows that open.  Reasonable prices - would come again and recommend to others.  Bar but ok for families - lots of TVs."}
{"text":"manager contacted me, via email, to offer me a free lunch and to apologize. i appreciated the gesture, but declined. no longer a restaurant i'd frequent, not even for free.........main reason: the new menu is REALLY awful! i can overlook some kitchen glitches and a poor server, but if there's nothing on the menu you'd eat, why would i go back?"}
{"text":"A group of five spent the week working in Cleveland.  We picked Harry Buffalo for our first dinner.  The food was reasonably priced and the service was excellent - 6:00 on a Monday, before a 7:00 Indian's game.
The daily special was a basket of chicken fingers and fries for $6.  Two had it as an entree, one had it as an appetizer.  Everyone seemed happy with their choice.
I had the half slab of ribs with fries and cole slaw.  The ribs were terrific, meaty and tender, fall off the bone.  Fries were great too - golden brown and delicious.  
Two had the burgers - bison and beef.  No complaints.
I would go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Very friendly and respectful staff that continuously checked on my friends and I  Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places for customer service. Sat at a table on the patio for 20 minutes. No one ever came over to take a drink order or food order."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places you can go before a game or an event downtown but none offer the fun atmosphere, geographic proximity, food quality, excellent staff staff, or the efficiency that Harry Buffalo East Fourth. The food is excellent, the beer selection is impressive, and there are TVs everywhere. I can't imagine going to a Cavs or Indians game and not at least stopping by HBE4. If you haven't checked it out in a while, do yourself and your family a favor and swing by. If you are an out of towner, hand out with the locals and have an amazing burger or their boneless wings (my personal favorite). A+!"}
{"text":"We met friends there for St. Patrick's Day. The place was packed when we got there. Although all the servers were swamped they did a very good job. My wife and I had the corn beef special and were very pleased with our food. They had a good cover band playing and also a bagpipe band. So all in all-good food, good beer, good music, good service!"}
{"text":"This is a bar first and foremost. If you want something good to eat try any of the great restaurants nearby. I asked my waiter if the steaks were good here. His reply should have tipped me off, he said I have never tried it, I'm new here but I sold 2 today. I ordered the steak with baked potato,veggies and a side salad. The baked potato was so cold it wouldn't melt my butter. The veggies were actually seasoned nicely and tasted great. The steak was so tough I couldn't eat it. My waiter asked how everything was so I told him. He could not have cared less. I asked for my bill, paid and left. Eating here makes me want to turn vegan ! To say it was terrible is an understatement !!! Never again but then again it is just a bar ! What was I thinking ?? Apparently I wasn't abd should have known better  Don't make the same mistake !!!!"}
{"text":"this place was awful terrible wait staff would not even seat us...... I left a bad review on here 4 weeks ago the owner called we and asked for a second chance said he would send me a gift card to have dinner on him because the service was so BAD ... Never happened even the owner has terrible service I WILL NEVER GO BACK AND I WILL NEVER REFER ANYONE HERE!"}
{"text":"Oh, Harry Buffalo. I don't know how the hell we ended up in this place one weekend because it sure didn't appeal to me. Everywhere else was packed, maybe? Yes, that's right - damn Indians game.

Anyway, we went in for just a few beers as we were killing time before the MGMT show at the Masonic Auditorium. I actually ended up liking this place so kudos to you Harry Buffalo.

We ended up having two different servers as we caught the first one right before his shift ended. Both were awesome, though.

Post-MGMT, we came back (before leaving when they closed 1AM to go to Flannery's) and hung out at the bar. Somehow basketball came up and we got to hear some hilarious stories about the day of the infamous Lebron James press conference. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place could easily be a 5 star place. Good food,great atmosphere, Clean bathrooms ,Free arcade games. The menu is pretty tight. Enough choices that's it's not overwhelming but enough where you can please most people. The problem was purely the service and maybe some of the food techniques we're lacking that extra level of just rightness. We ordered wings,fries,pretzels,buffalo chicken egg rolls & a skillet cookie. The wings were okay but lacked crispness. The fries were fine. The pretzel with cheese were a real light(The cheese was great, you don't come across great cheese sause often).  The buffalo chicken egg rolls got sent back they we're just not good. The skillet cookie was under done. You don't want cookie dough in a skillet you want some crispness with the ice cream. 

Overall I would love to come back but the service really was super slow and the waitress showed zero interest in our table. Maybe not zero more like 13% or 15%. I always wonder is the service bad because we're a black family and they think we won't tip. I seriously would like to return but this will always be on my mind."}
{"text":"Website states this place is open until 2am. Showed up here with a group tonight at 1am hoping to get some food and drinks, they decided to close early. Now we can't get the late dinner we were hoping for after working a very long day."}
{"text":"This review is strictly food related.  My wife and I went at noon on a Wednesday to have lunch together in between my busy schedule.  For those that have been before and had a bad experience.. don't give up on this place yet.  Their menu is much easier to navigate (no more 10 pages of sticky plastic) and their food is much, MUCH improved.  I wish I had taken pictures because the presentation was again..  much improved.

  My wife had one of their rice bowls.. she was super happy with it.  Good lunch portion and very tasty.  I had the Persian tacos.  Perfect portion and also very delicious.  

  If you've tried this place in the past and been disappointed it may be worth checking it out again.  They seem to have upped their game a bit.  Nicely done buffalo.. nicely done"}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. There may have been 20 people in here and the speakers were ROARING. The waitress couldn't even hear my order. I ordered a Dark N Stormy, thinking it would be...idk... A DARK N STORMY. Rum, ginger beer, lime. Ya know, the USUAL. Whatever it was showed up in a shot glass with no ice. I sent it back, thinking surely she misheard me because of the insane noise level. The bartender then sends it back saying \"oh, it's not a real dark n stormy. It's our house version.\" 

Umm. How about you NAME IT SOMETHING ELSE?! I then ordered a strawberry lemonade margarita, thinking surely they couldn't mess that up. Boy, I was wrong. It was literally strawberry lemonade Kool-Aid and tequila. THEN, buffalo chicken dip showed up. I'm thinking shredded cheese, chicken, buffalo sauce, cream cheese. Right? Wrong again. Chunked grilled chicken on top of cream cheese. Literally no flavor. FINALLY, my boneless wings and fries arrive. COLD. Not cool, COLD. The fries were so overcooked that there was no potato in the middle, just crunch. Plus, they may have been cooked 3 hours earlier. The wings were edible, but cold. Overall, it was a miserable experience and I wouldn't recommend it to my dog."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Harry Buffalo. This is our go to spot before we go to concerts at the Q or games at Progressive. The atmosphere is so fun with opened walls so you are apart of the outside. It's always packed but with fun, cleveland loving people that are just happy to be in the area. The food is decent, especially their boneless wings (ah-mazing). They always have a great selection of drinks and always have some type of special going on, especially during baseball or cavs games. This is a great location to go with friends and to pregame before going out on the town!"}
{"text":"If you want a cheap place to eat, with beer and don't really care that much about quality than this is place. The waitress was quick with the food, although she failed to mention the soda had no carbonation, my buddy returned the drink for water and she tried to charge him. No biggy she fixed it.  I had the wings and ribs meal which was really spicy, and pretty damn good for bar food. Their iced tea had pretty good Flavor."}
{"text":"We've been regular customers here for years, but won't be coming back.  My last 3 visits were frustrating, and we never even got a chance to be seated!  A few months ago, my child and I were very dissapointed during an attempted visit.  As we walked through the door, we were told there was a $15 cover charge for some stupid, overhyped fight they were carrying on TV!  As regulars who just wanted to have dinner there, we were rudely told that they could not accomodate the two of us for dinner (unless we paid the cover charge), so we left upset!  This is no way to treat longtime customers!  More recently, we went there only to discover a full parking lot and hundreds of people in line spilling outside.  I guess there was some kind of giveaway or lottery going on, and we didn't get seated.  Strike two.  Just last week, we went there on a Monday night, and the place was extremely packed, due to a 'kids eat for free' night.  I'd rather pay for my child's dinner, and be able to find a parking space and be seated quickly.  Needless to say, we didn't bother with the long wait, and took our business to Red Lobster.  Strike three.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Ate at their Lakewood location (which wasn't an option on Yelp), and the food and service were awesome! My wife and I both had their buffalo burgers, fries and New England Clam Chowder.

Unlike most restaurant's clam chowder, theirs didn't come out watery -- it had good sized chunks of clam.  

The buffalo burger was awesome, and cooked to perfection.  And their fries were to die for -- whatever the seasoning is that is used was fantastic.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish that there was a six star! Granted, this was my first time (but it will not be my last) and dining experiences rest greatly on what you order. However, this could not have been a better experience. My wife and I are moving into the area. We were shopping for appliances and used Yelp to find a place for lunch. We are both big fans of hot sandwiches and pizza. 

Our server was great (prompt, friendly and attentive).

Our eyes went straight to the buffalo chicken and Mac and cheese sandwich. We knew that lunch would be our main meal for the day and so we also decided to also order the same combination of food in a pizza. 

Both were amazingly and sinfully delicious! If other items are half as good, this place will be our go to restaurant for informal dining."}
{"text":"Your friendly Parma Hts soccer team and I come here after every Tuesday game. What started out as a lovely relationship, soon turned into searching for another bar and grill to enjoy.

I hate to give another bad review but honestly....
My friends simply tried to order beer off the board. Five requested beers and five \"Oh I'm sorry we don't have that's\" later, we found out that they didn't offer half of the ones written up there anymore. When my friend made a few jokes about it the waitress told us they are all two lazy to get up there and change it. I understand that when you go to a place for months the employees become more comfortable with you. We are still customers and telling us you're too lazy to change the beer board is not ok. You should never have to settle for your sixth choice in beer because your first five aren't available. The first five shouldn't have been taunting you from a beer board in the first place. I haven't been back in two weeks. 

Maybe it's not the restaurant, maybe it's just the staff. Regardless, the snail cats and I will be looking for a new \"after game hang out place\" in the future."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Lakewood location. Maybe because Tony George isn't at this one as often as he's at Lakewood. Food was marginal at this location. The menu is way too busy and substitutions are like doing algebra. There's an old adage: When you have 50 things on a menu it means none of the 50 are any good. That adage proved true. I realize their appealing to the mall crowd, so they may be able to financially justify what they are doing, but that doesn't mean it's good. It wasn't. I'll go to the Lakewood location next time."}
{"text":"Been to other locations and have never seen this. Went on in at about 430 and only a few people there. Ok, it early, was told sit anywhere. After 5 minutes we got menus. 20 minutes later as we got up to leave I see there is only 1 table of 4 and 4 people at the bar. WTF! Bad service!"}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese bake.  Awesomeness. Good burgers too.  Nice big screens.  Great sports bar in the middle of the Gateway District.  Excellent service also."}
{"text":"Finally decided to Give Harry Buffalo a try after driving past it just about everyday.         

First impressions were not good, the place was busy there were a few people waiting when we walked in nothing crazy though. The host was very unprofessional and rude he obviously didn't care much about his job.         
                                                                         
Our waitress was polite but very slow (not her fault) as she was running around trying to wait on a few too many tables at once all while someone in manager getup was standing and talking to a table of patrons for nearly our entire visit.                                   

We placed two orders of wings and fries, the fries were garbage and tasted like cardboard, the wings were room temp, very rubbery and tastless.  The table across from us apparently felt the same way about their food and were very vocal about it and left.   The bill was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.

With all the other great restaurants in the North Olmsted area there is absolutely no reason to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Very good food, love the stampedes and atmosphere. Could use more IPAs on draft though :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and went to pick it up at 4:40 on a week day. They were not busy so early yet the server left me waiting at the bar for 10 minutes, while she had a conversation with the only person seated at the bar and another employee. My food was already sitting there when I got there. Needless to say our food was cold and fries and buns were soggy. I don't recommend ordering take out from here. Imagine how it would have been if they were busy."}
{"text":"Polite prompt service. Good, hot food. Went at 7:30 on a sat, was told there would be a ten minute wait. We were seated 5 minutes later. The server was efficient, refilled drinks when needed. Our food arrived quickly and warm and correct(one substitution). In and out in less then an hour without rushing or feeling rushed. Much better service then the Lakewood location. I am sad the this place isn't in the mall anymore. But not that big of a deal."}
{"text":"There's a pool table and touch screen. The deals are great for the weekend. On Fridays there's $2 half pitchers of Coors Light. The service is amazing. The bartenders are quick and friendly. Had a great time here."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this bar and the people who work here. Whether you are singing thunderstruck or watching the game it's always a good time. 
They even have a downstairs bar which is great option for fundraisers or special events. Bartenders are always fast and always smiling no matter how busy it is. The wings are amazing and I highly recommend the French onion soup. Also their claw machine has been a great source of entertainment for me and later for my dog. Props to Mike and Ness for running such a great place."}
{"text":"I'll go out on the limb and give this place a 4.  I AM a regular there for the Wednesday trivia and $1.50 pint specials for happy hour where giving it a 4 and not a 5 will probably get be zero points with John the GM. 

I like to review based on the options I have within a couple miles of each establishment.  Here you have an Irish Pub up the street, a Bistro going north on Bishop, (2) dives on Wilson Mills, leaving Panini's on Mayfield or Wright Place / Firehouse / Spectators on Chardon as sports bar options.  I'm sure I've missed a few so be sure to let me know which ones I need to try.

Personally, the Buff is much closer and I really go there for 5 reasons:

1) The cheap beer
2) The wait staff / bartenders / patrons
3) The food (pizza, burgers, herd platter, wings)
4) Patio / Bags
5) Trivia

This is enough for me to give this place a 5 but unfortunately I cannot compare to other places I've been in my life.  It does, however, have everything I need at this moment in my life.  A lot of people use it as a after work bar, post golf, large work groups, guys night out, etc. so to each their own, just know that there should be something there that you will like.  Read the other reviews and enjoy."}
{"text":"This Harry Buffalo has a really good downtown location and is a pretty good option for after drinks following ball games, concerts, or just for a late night snack.  HB has just changed their menu but this location is still serving the previous revision which I tend to prefer.  It helps that I know 2 people that work there and get hooked up each time I'm there with great service.  It's also nice when they blast open the windows for an open, breezy feel."}
{"text":"At first glance, this seems like just another meathead wanna-be frat boy bar. I would say the downtown location is closer to this description. Not so much with the Lakewood spot. The crowd tends to be a little older, especially for football watching and the like. That said, I've never been here on a Friday or Saturday night. 

Anyway, the bar area is big and in general it has a slightly-western theme sports bar feel. 

What I was really impressed with though, was the menu. There are plenty of words like 'Kobe beef' and 'local' that really surprised me. Some unique appetizers and entrées too that you don't see everywhere. I was very much expecting the largely fried, same-old-stuff menu that you get at most bars. 

We got wings and cheesy garlic bread. Wings were good, medium sauce was medium and tasty. The cheesy bread was SO GOOD and served really hot and melty with a side of chunky marinara for dipping. 

We will definitely be back to watch some games now that I know the menu is much better than average."}
{"text":"My sister, her husband, my husband and I have been frequenting the Harry Buffalo for the past year at least once per month.  Up until now, the place was great.  Good service, good food, good beer and good GM.  Went there this past Saturday for \"customer appreciation day\" and what a clusterf**k.  Had to wait about 20 minutes for the clearly overworked waitress to come take our beer order.  Beer finally showed up to the table another 15 minutes after we ordered it.  They then gave us plastic cups to drink out of because \"it's too busy and the glasses are all dirty, so this is all we have.\"  Seriously?  This isn't a frat party?  I'm a grownup...clean some glasses!!  They were supposed to have a buffet set up with some appetizers, but that never even happened.  About an hour after we arrived, they threw some cheesy bread on the table and said that's all there would be and we were supposed to \"pass it around\" so other people could have some!!!  I tried to order a round of shots for our table and was told that the bartender couldn't make the shots because she \"didn't have the time.\"  My sister and I got to talk with some of the people at surrounding tables and they were equally disappointed.  I asked to talk to the GM multiple times, but was told he was too busy!  Really?  I'm pretty sure he didn't want to hear any complaints because he knew he had completely screwed up the planning for such large crowds.  This place used to have a GM, Matt, that was pretty phenomenal, always checked with the tables to see if everyone was satisfied.  What a huge mistake getting rid of that guy because based on my most recent experience, we won't be back.  I'd rather give my money to a place that values my business.  The only reason I even gave this place 2-stars was to be nice.  They didn't deserve it Saturday night."}
{"text":"Had better wings. Had better burgers, Had better pulled pork (though, much better than Hot Sauce Williams pulled pork). Just a plus because it is so close to Q Arena."}
{"text":"Eh, its okay at the Buff. Same old bar style food and atmosphere, kind of like a Winking Lizard or Panini's. I do like the idea of their smaller portioned late night menu and their relatively healthy try's on the menu. Other than that, its a typical beer selection and the bartenders that could take you or leave you as a customer. Although, I have yet to try Bison, so maybe once I do it'll make up for it."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to grab a bite to eat before you head to a game! The weather was nice so they had the big garage door windows open making the place feel open and airy. 

The food is good for bar food. I had a salad and was very impressed by how fresh the ingredients were. The rest of my table got wings and burgers which all came with a mound of waffle fries. 

The service was on the slower side but not anything that would stop us from returning. Overall, very good experience!"}
{"text":"Close to my hotel, server Gina was awesome staff was very friendly ! Ordered the boneless wings they were awesome! Wine selection not so good but overall very happy with the place!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  Came for lunch and was greeted by a friendly staff.  My waiter was extremely attentive and helpful.  I tried the buffalo chicken and mac and cheese melt.  The sandwich was good.  The fries were hot and fresh(battered fries).  Good food in combination of great service."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place if you are really thirsty and sitting RIGHT at the bar and want to watch some sports.  Anywhere else in the place and you are liable to turn invisible to some of their wait staff.

Their food is average at best, the beer and wine menu weak and with Winking Lizard right down the street with much better atmosphere, food and service, I think this location may be yet another restaurant to die in this strip center space!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried much other than the wings and chicken sandwich, but those are great. The boneless wings and fries are my favorite allowing you to mix flavors. Always attentive servers and fast service. Will surely return."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a bite to eat, and watch the game plenty of TVs. The service is on point. The specials are good. I will be back keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of this chain, but the new menu at this location deserves a second look! Tons of fun creative takes on bar food. Also, they have so many special running for different days of the week like a top-notch wing night on Mondays and Sunday Game day drink specials to name a few! This also seems like a fun place to grab a drink on the weekends."}
{"text":"Ordered Harry Buff on uber eats tonight. Quick delivery. I Ordered the chicken tacos they were pretty bland. However, my friend ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese Sammie and it was absolutely delish. I'll def be ordering that next time."}
{"text":"The beer I ordered was wrong both times they brought it out, even though the glass was labeled the correct beer.  

The food was wrong, which boneless wings are pretty hard to screw up.  The servers are more interested in the bar patrons than serving on the floor.  Our first server sat and watched us sit down, but continued her conversation at the bar, and the next server could t get anything right either."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. There are several nationally known restaurants in the area but this is one that I did not recognize. So I wasn't sure what to expect.   The menu is very much like most pub menu's. They did have a selection of of soups and salads as well.   So I didn't want much so I ordered the chicken tenders, available grilled or fried, with fries.  These tenders where homemade and delicious and served with waffle fries.  I had a great lunch and would return again."}
{"text":"Great burgers and good service. I like the Heard Buffalo Burger the best. Very lean and tasty. Beer prices I would say the average. We usually come out when UFC fights are on. Not everyone knows that HB shows the PPV so its less crowded that other places :)"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink or an app before or after a ballgame. I like how they converted this old brick building into an open well-lit space. The whole bar had a feeling of being on the sidewalk as passers by were in conversation and/or heckled from the bar. With all the great spots to eat in the area, it wouldn't be my choice for dinner. But for wings, a burger, or nachos it's okay."}
{"text":"We sat on the bar side of the restaurant. We asked about different types of beer, our server said, \"She wasn't a beer person.\" Then she gave us a list that was obviously outdated as half of them were no longer available. Then she explained it was Taco Tuesday; $3 each. On the menu, fish tacos were 3 for $9 with waffle fries. Special, no fries. So the special was less special than the regular menu item. The rest of the people in our party of six enjoyed their food okay. Salads looked fresh, burgers cooked to temp. So with a little better management, this would be at least a four star place. Train your servers to know their product and make sure your specials aren't more expensive than the same item on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good burgers!  They have beef and buffalo..and their waffle fries are the bomb!  Glad we went here when in Cleveland for a concert."}
{"text":"Got the ribs coleslaw and cornbread... I must say the worst meal out I've ever had everything tasted horrible"}
{"text":"My friends and I used to love coming here... Until they hired all new bartenders. Cindy, who is the bar manager, has an attitude, no sense of urgency and visibly drinks on the job. They are slow on serving drinks all the time, even when the bar is dead. I'm very disappointed because this used to be our go to place. Not anymore. I will never step foot inside this bar again."}
{"text":"I really like the bison burgers, and the price doesn't hurt. I always eat the bar, and get pretty good service every time."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite restaurant. Ordered 4 drinks that tasted like watered down medicine. After expressing my displeasure with the drinks, the waiter said he would see what he could do. Upon returning we were only offered another drink. However, we had already waited some time to express our displeasure and wait for a response, and needed to leave. Nothing else was offered to compensate us, not even a measly 10% discount. Perhaps most disappointing is the manager couldn't even take a few minutes to speak with us to better understand the situation. Quite simply: Poor management, poor service, and terrible drinks. Take your money elsewhere. And even if you can't get a good drink elsewhere, at least give your money to someone that cares and will give you he time of day."}
{"text":"Pretty typical bar food. Menu is okay and paninis are pretty good. My biggest complaint was where they say is by the outdoor patio. Every time someone open or closed the door, our napkins and everything else went flying."}
{"text":"Above average for typical bar food. The prices are very fair, but above all else, the staff is exceptional! We had a group of six recently, and we never had to wait too long for anything. This is a great little place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want to smoke with your meal. It is clearly allowed by management, even though prohibited by state law. But this isn't a small, dark neighborhood bar. It is a chain restaurant in a shopping mall. We stopped in for a quick meal on a windy day, sitting on the nice patio, overlooking the mall parking lot. After we had given the friendly waitress our order, we noticed strong cigarette smoke. Looking around there were lit cigarettes at four or more of the tables. We moved inside to try to avoid the smoke, but it blew into and permeated the inside of the place. The patio is open to the inside of the restaurant. The outdoor patio is completely covered, so state law prohibits smoking, even on the patio. It completely ruined our meal, given both of us are rather sensitive to tobacco smoke. 

Service was pleasant, but slow. Food was passable. My fish was fine. The waffle fries, ordered \"extra crispy,\" were cold and soggy. The slaw had an odd taste too it, but after adding some ranch dressing was eatable. My wife's burger was hot off the grill--a good thing--cooked as ordered, but nothing special.

Interior was cluttered and could have used some cleaning and updating.

Overall a pretty miserable experience. Although if it had not been for the illegal smoking, it would have been three stars. Blatant violation of state law takes it down to one."}
{"text":"This is a place I normally want to stop in before, after or during a game. It's nice that they are so close to all of the fields (minus the browns) and I like that they can open their windows so it has a great feel. It's definitely a bar bar, like I wouldn't go here just for dinner. The food is not bad, I usually get a salad or sandwich with a cold beer. I've had their french onion soup before and it was incredibly salty for my taste and I like salty foods. 

Overall, great bar to watch a game at or catch a beer (or two) before or after a game."}
{"text":"An A-OK bar to hang out at. Not my absolute favorite but not the worst either. This is a good place to go when the weather is nice and you just want a casual beer. Their open air patio is nice and the TVs make it a great place to watch sports. It's usually always busy out there so make sure you can find yourself a spot. 

The food is your average bar food, nothing special but nothing bad. Their drinks are good, again nothing special and nothing bad. Our service has always been pretty good here. 

All in all, we stop in every once in awhile to grab a casual beer and just hang out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for a quick dinner or a night out with drinks. I live so close that it makes it so easy to drop over and grab one of their tasty burgers or other dinners/lunches. They often have good drink deals, like the beer of the month where you can get a $6 pitcher of the beer, or they do a lot of themed events for whatever holiday is coming up. This place gets PACKED for Buckeye games, so you really gotta get there early if you want a seat at the bar. The people who go there range from early 20's to later 30's with a spattering of everything else. I've seen families and large groups come through and have a good time. I've never had trouble with the wait staff or the bartenders. When it isn't very busy, they are usually talkative and engaging."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch at Harry Buffal a couple weeks ago with co-workers.  I ordered a chicken salad, I guess because I've been trying to lose a few pounds.  The other dudes I was with ordered burgers and didn't make fun of my salad.

It would be nice to find lunch for under $10, but that's pretty hard to do.  With tip and drink, bill came to $15.  Food and service were good."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Harry Buffalo every Wednesday for the past eight weeks!  Why?  Because they have been hosting an Idol Karaoke contest, which is a knockoff of American Idol.  My cousin competed in the contest and ended up taking 2nd place.  I'm writing my review because I have had extensive interaction with this bar and its staff.

Service:
Overall the service is good, but not great.  Sometimes, when the bar is very busy, the waitresses forget to push beer on the patrons.  The goal is to sell as much beer as possible right?  So I would expect them to sprint back and forth with beer.  Nope, they casually take your drink order and skip some people at your table as if they're not there...as if being a waitress and having to write something down is difficult.  I think they want to memorize your drink order so they don't have to write stuff down.  But when the place is packed and there are 8 people standing around one table, you can't just ask one dude, \"What would you like\" and then go fetch his order.  No, you ask everyone and write that stuff down!  Waitresses did it wrong and some did it right.  Strange.  

Food:
Only tried one sandwich and I don't remember the name of it, but it was excellent.  My cousin ordered the same sandwich almost every week and it was amazing.  It was very consistent, the taste and quality.  The fries are okay too.

Atmosphere:
On Wednesday nights, the atmosphere is great except for the second hand cigarette smoke.  The place is usually full (due to the Idol contest) and people are talking and drinking.  You can play board games like Connect4, Sorry, Uno, etc too!  They have one Xbox 360 available to play also, which is nice if you like Madden.  There is a full bar, full kitchen, plenty of seats, and an outdoor patio.  Since it is illegal in Ohio to smoke indoors at a public establishment, everyone smokes on the patio.  Smoking is my pet peeve, by the way.  So when people go outside to smoke in the partially enclosed patio, the smoke hits the ceiling and accumulates out there.  It doesn't drift away as it would in a roofless patio.  Here's the kicker, when the door opens, all the smoke comes rushing into the bar, filling it with smoke.  It's terrible!  It doesn't matter where you sit, you will wreak like smoke when you leave.  That's the biggest drawback from a non-smoker's perspective and an anti-second-hand-smoke advocate.  This is a bad thing.

Additionally, there are plenty of flat screen TVs to watch the Cavs game or football on.  There is free Wi-Fi for you Internet surfers too!

Overall, I would recommend Harry Buffalo, especially the bison burgers.  But if you don't like smoke, this particular location will bother you when it's busy.  When it's not busy, it isn't an issue."}
{"text":"My wife went out with her co-workers here and I asked her to bring me some take-out for dinner Friday night.  When she got home, she promptly presented me the fish n chips that I requested.  Also, she brought a few of her leftovers along.  

Note: this review is being written from a takeout perspective and not a sit-down perspective.

Loaded Pita Nachos - these were soggy and gross.  None of the toppings stayed on the pita.  Don't ever order this to go because the longer it sits, the soggier the pita bread becomes.  The green onions were overpowering.

Wings - wings were great, no complaints.

Fisn n Chips - the fish was still warm when I ate it, but it had bones in it.  This is a huge no-no in my book.  I'll never order this dish again from Harry Buffalo.  Also, it was overly greasy and there wasn't a lot of meat to it.  The fries were soggy and not very flavorful.  I don't recommend this dish at all.

I've eaten at other Harry Buffalo locations and have been quite pleased with their food, especially the Bison Burgers.  But this location doesn't seem to have it all together."}
{"text":"New Location with lots if updates!!
The food is still good and they changed the drink menu.....(I want my pitchers back....LoL)

The mini Nintendo systems are a pretty cool addition.

I wish the Wings were deep fried more crispy and why not add ribs outside of the Combo?"}
{"text":"Decent prices and nice atmosphere.  Music and tvs to keep you busy if eating alone...but not too loud so that you could still have a conversation with someone at the table.

Good food.  Nice rib eye special."}
{"text":"The menu says \"world best bar food\" and you know what?  They're not lying.  We were worn out after a day at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and wanted to find someplace near our hotel to grab a quick bite.  We had spotted the Harry Buffalo the night before and after giggling at the name again, decided to give it try.

It didn't look like much when we walked in and other than the lone server/bartender, we were it.  The place was empty but I will take a guess that because it was nearly 2:30 on a Monday afternoon, we missed the lunch rush.  Our server, Oksana, was friendly, helpful, funny and hands down the most gorgeous girl I have ever seen waiting tables.  Even my 60 something sister in law commented on how stunning she was.  

On to the food!  I had the Cleveland Cheesteak Sub, which was shaved rib eye steak with green peppers, mushrooms, caramelized red onions and mayo on a toasted hoagie, topped by mozzarella and baked to a nice golden brown.   Soooooooooo good!   I chose the fresh cut fries, which are made fresh daily, one entire potato per order and absolutely delicious!  My hubby and brother in law both had the Bison Burger and both gave rave reviews.  

Great food, outstanding service and large portions.  Can't ask for more, especially on vacation!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, awesome food, and cold beer. 

Reasonably priced menu and they show UFC fights there if you're into that"}
{"text":"Music was decent, some old songs that I enjoyed. The food smelled good but the hospitality was pretty much lacking. Tried to order drinks, but had to wait and flag someone down, and when I did, I felt like I got snubbed. Tried to start a conversation, and even though the place was pretty empty, I felt unwelcome. Maybe that's just how places are out here, because I'm from out of state, but I wasn't expecting to be ignored. Was hoping to order two or three drinks, but stopped at one because I felt like I was intruding. And when I pay ten dollars for a drink, I probably shouldn't feel like that. But that's just my opinion, I hope you have a better time when you come here, but I probably wouldn't come back even if I lived here."}
{"text":"OK. So my husband are like the high road (me and my fancy tastes) and the low road (he and his distictly non-fancy tastes). Now this place is definitely more low road. Standard bar fare. Full bar. 

BUT I'm writing this review to let people know that they have 2 amazing concepts that really need to be more widespread around Cleveland: 1) a large patio and 2) free wifi. We went to three other places looking to grab a drink and utilize wifi--nuthin.

Thank you Harry Buffalo. I will be back. I'll just eat a salad before I get there. :)"}
{"text":"This place gets our business simply because it's the only place between the parking garage and the Q.  They have $3 tall Miller Lite for the Cavs games and good service if you snag a couple bar stools.  

Somehow, our quick app choices of food always turn into the talk of the bar.  

In case you're wondering what 'cheese hammers' are, it looks like a giant deep friend marshmallow.  On a skewer.  But it's a huge cube of cheese.  Deep fried.  Like a hammer.  While putting the order in, our slightly douchey bartender told us, 'Yea, it's good.  You won't shit for a few days, but it's good.'"}
{"text":"Typical Lakewood bar, but a good place to sit if you're looking for a hustling place with good food, fun people watching and pretty cheap drinks. The buffalo Mac n cheese is super yum!"}
{"text":"I went tonight with my BFF.  I never usually go to bars like this but my BFF wanted to.... We had the loaded nachos which were actually loaded pita chips and then we had the hot pretzels with cheddar cheese and of course cocktails.  Allison was our bartender and was on point!!!  Seriously had a great Sunday ...even after the CLEVELAND BROWNS got killed :("}
{"text":"I stopped in here looking for a good place to eat, and this place fit the bill.  There was a big bar area with huge open windows that gave you all the benefits of sitting outside while still keeping you covered.  And the menu...was just crazy.  I can't imagine anyone coming in here and not finding something to eat.  They have a huge selection of wraps, pizza, burgers - basically anything you can think of.  I even saw that they had a bunch of combo lunch specials - and I'm dying to try their cinammon sugar apple fries with caramel dipping sauce.  See - they're all over the place in a good way.  Anyways, I decided to go the burger route, and since this place is all about the customizable burger, I went with the Buffalo Burger, topped with a pretzel bun.  Yes, a pretzel bun - and it tasted damn good.  You will definitely see me back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Harry Buffalo with friends, we expect to wait a decent amount of time for service and for food. It just always seems to move a little slow here. 

Despite the slow service, I did very much enjoy my last visit here. I ordered the baked buffalo chicken mac and cheese, but quickly decided to change it to the buffalo chicken mac and cheese pizza. I'm so glad I got the pizza; the crust was perfect, and the flavor was so good. 

We don't come here often because of the service, but sometimes I wish we did just for that pizza!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place.  Sat at the bar, the manager and both bartenders were fun and attentive.  I loved the build your own salad option.  The trivia was a plus."}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the past month and had a great experience both times. The service was just amazing the second time. I'm guessing they have new management because not only did the waitress frequent our table many times but the manager came over to see how we were doing as well. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and jojos and I got the burger. Both our meals were fantastic! He got two chicken breast and jojos for only $9 I believe and the hot honey sauce on it was delicious. My burger was cooked exactly how I asked which is rare nowadays. We had a great time and will be sure to come back here in the future."}
{"text":"With out a doubt my favorite place is Lakewood! Harry Buffalo pretty much has everything you are looking for. This place is perfect for sporting events with there 2 huge tvs directly in the middle. It is also laid out with a bunch of other tvs surrounding the entire place. Football season is a great atmosphere and they are always sound up for Browns and Buckeyes. The staff is fantastic! From management to bartenders and evertything in between. They always make you feel very comfortable when here. 

The food is always great. Being a huge burger fan, its almost impossible to not get my fix at Harry Buffalo. Try the Bison burger. You will have your choice of bison or beef but the bison is great! A huge selection of burgers, sandwiches, and it doesnt stop there. Cheesy Garlic Bread... Enough said!  Oh ya, did I mention they have 6 dollar pitchers? Great deal when sitting with friends watching a game. Check out the weekly specials as well. They always offer something different. Sunday Fundays are known to be amazing at this place. I have been known to go to a few here and there! If its weekend day/night drinking, lunch/dinner with the friends or family, check out the Buff."}
{"text":"An excellent experience.  The food was served HOT on a Cavs night.  Very Good service.  A minor order mixup led to a dessert that is worth coming back for. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Was out on the east side last week and came in to watch the Cavs game. Harry Buffalo is always a solid choice regardless of location or day of the week. There is a always a daily special going on which makes it easier to decide on what to get. Wings are always a solid choice as is any of the bowl options. It is good to see some healthy dining options at a place where you can also watch a game. Usually if it is a bar to watch a game, you are eating something very unhealthy and will later regret."}
{"text":"I went to Popeye's Chicken on Clark the other day. I should have just went to The Buff for the Henny Chicken. The fried chicken comes with hot honey and the Northeast Ohio classic JoJo potatoes. I usually go to SoHo on Wednesdays for their fried chicken and think I will switch it up and come back to my homeland in Lakewood. We came in for beer and trivia the other night and had a great time. Never had a problem getting good service here even when sitting behind the taps at the bar. This is the quintessential Lakewood bar. One of the only ones I will go to on Detroit Ave anymore. I have been gentrified out to Madison bars. I will be driving in to watch the Browns lose here a lot once the season gets started."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave a review about the food but we never made it that far. We walked in this evening and stood next to the sign that said \" please wait to be seated.\" Two minutes passed, no one sat us. No one acknowledged us by even saying Hi. Not even the bar tender standing 20 feet away. This was our first and now last experience at this establishment. Too bad."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday.  We were greeted promptly, asked whether we wanted a table or booth.  I responded no booth, regular table (I am very short and cannot sit at the high tops and find booths uncomfortable also).  We were then seated at a normal table.  Someone took our drink orders and then a person came over and told us that we couldn't sit at that table because they were having a first communion party and were going to put the gifts on that table and that we would have to move.  Don't know who that person was, either a customer or someone from HB.  Then someone from HB came over and said that we could sit there but might be more comfortable if we move.   I asked if they had another table and she said \"sure\" and promptly took us over to the bar where the only tables were high tops.  We left."}
{"text":"Although the ground floor looks like a jumpin' place to be, if you decide to dine upstairs you'll find the decor to be mismatched, outdated and the overall apperance to be just ok. HOWEVER - if you can sit through all of that, the food is more than EXCELLENT!  And the sweet potatoe fries were the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I had the bison (for the first time), and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Prepared medium-well, the meat was still moist, yet flavorful.  The (pre-season) football games were on (which is always a plus)...  My husband had the perch, which I had to stop myself from eating all of his and the sweet potato fries should be a illegal, they are so good!  If you are trying to lose weight, this may not be the place to go because they have so many things that are great and you can add \"extreme sides\" which are small portions of appetizers or entrees, so....  It's hard to pull yourself from the table!  I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Alright.  I had the same exact experience the next time (see below for the juicy details). The server was slightly more attentive but the food was meh. Sticking with 2 stars and I probably won't go back unless someone forces me."}
{"text":"Solid sports bar.  We came here for drinks, apps, and a Browns game before a comedy show at Hilarities. Ordered the Bison chili fries and Pita nachos, and both were outstanding.  Drinks were reasonably priced and they had plenty of TVs. Exactly what you want from a sports bar."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the Jays/Indians game. Everyone had a good time. My wife ordered the grilled chicken dinner entree with rice and said it was surprisingly good. I had wings and the fries. I may be in the minority but I prefer the \"new\" waffle fries to what they had. Kids liked their meals. Didn't know when we walked in but it was also kids night so they ate for only 99 cents. The bill was very reasonable when you compare to someplace like BW3.  Service was just \"ok\", but again, it was a busy night with the Indians ALCS game."}
{"text":"Ordered a carryout of 2 of their boneless wing order. Both were so horribly over cooked and bone dry they were inedible. The meat just broke apart and crumbled in your mouth. Absolutely horrible. Also only got one set of cutlery for our 2 meals, so we had to share a fork. Annoying."}
{"text":"Awesome little joint offering all kind of good food. I had the Cajun bowl which was fresh and healthy. Broccoli, shrimp, carrots, rice, etc...very good, the bison burger at the table looked amazing and came with a mountain of waffle fries. The turkey avocado sandwich also looks very good and was served on big Texas toast style bread. We had a local beer they had on tap and it is a new favorite. We were there before a Cavaliers game and they knew it and got our food out and us out and on our way like ninjas. Don't worry if your short on time, they can do it. There are a few around town, check them out."}
{"text":"Ok...it's a bar so it's bar food. I had the Black and Bleu burger. I enjoyed it. It comes with and pretty tasty waffle fry. The service is good and they have bands on weekends. It might be fun at night. My big concern is the outside area is closed off with plastic  and they let smokers be out there. When that door opens, a cloud of smoke rushes in. Not a good atmosphere for non smokers."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often before events at the surrounding venues! I must say that it is always a great time! Usually the crowd seems to mesh well since they are all down here for the same reason. 

Food:

I love the food here. For a bar doing the volume of business that they do, it seems to go pretty well. The bison burgers are amazing!!! Not only does it taste good, it takes away the guilt of eating a burger knowing its super lean meat! I recommend their pizza too. Its so great! For all you gluten free peeps their GF pizza is amazing! Its thin crust which I prefer and makes you feel like youre not missing out on anything that those peeps with no gluten allergy can have! 

If youre feeling super adventurous and like living life on the wild side (which I often do) id suggest the Buffalo chicken mac and cheese sando! Nweds no explanation!!!

Service: 

Considering the volume again...This place has definately nailed it with this round of staff members. It takes a certain amount of patience to deal with the clientele that frequents this bar bc as I mentioned before, everyone is down there for a large event or happening around town. They seem to make it work. 

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time and good food!"}
{"text":"good place to get cheap drinks, but the drinks are good.  didn't order any food.  Local sports were playing on the TV's."}
{"text":"I've been up and down east 4th, Harry buffalo is with out a doubt the friendliest bar on the street. Bartenders are engaging and full of witty banter.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Open and airy, just want you want for a bar in the summer, waiting to head to the game. Plus, a great tap doesn't hurt! I was excited to try the new Summer Shandy in grapefruit and it did not disappoint. 

I also tried a beershot for the first time. Those are some marvelously tasty things. And dangerous I imagine with a few of them, so be warned! But they were on special, so we had to take advantage, right?

Didn't have the food, but what was coming out (stacked burgers and a plate full of waffle fries) looked great."}
{"text":"Excellent Pulled Pork Sandwich and who doesn't love a place with free popcorn!

Great location and happy hour options."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is extremely misleading... usually a tell-tale sign when an establishment needs to advertise their \"happy hour\" at every entrance. The signs and waitress told us that Wednesday's were $8 dollar burger nights. We received a bill for a $16 dollar burger! When we asked the waitress she said she had a long night and couldn't remember and got the manager... the manager informed us that only a basic burger with no toppings would be included in the happy hour. We had $78 bill for a burger, fries, wings and 4 drinks. Very underwhelming and will not be returning."}
{"text":"The service is usually good, and the food is excellent when you dine in. But on the last couple of occasions when we've called in for carry out, the food quality has been way below their normal standards. On my last order, I ended up with burgers that were almost completely raw and fries that were unsalted and cold, despite that I was there to pick it up when it came out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"When I think of iconic bars in Lakewood, trendsetting bars really,\"the Buff\" reigns supreme. Some places lose their luster, slack after a client base is set, not this place. Since as far back as I can remember, the Buff has always been a go to for sporting events, pre-gaming, and the food. Definitely have to try the wings, many compare to Around the Corner, who also has good wings, but there is no comparison. 

The Buff has survived the storms and droughts other places couldnt handle. Back in the day, Paninis and McCarthys were comfortable on top. A precedent was set by the Buff, making anyone pondering starting a business think twice. Long and hard. Its apparent by now its here to stay, take notes"}
{"text":"Came here to kill some time before a concert at Quicken Loans Arena with my niece. There was no wait time which is great and the service nice and fast. Not 5 minutes after we ordered it seemed like our food came out. Got the Bayou Shrimp Mac+Cheese. Would definitely recommend it. It's a a great departure from the ordinary macaroni and cheese we're all used to. Also, we got the Brownie with Ice Cream and I was blown away! The best brownie I've ever tasted! Prices aren't that bad as well. Overall, I had a great experience and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Driving through on our way to PA, we stopped here. Burgers were ok, nothing special even though that appears to be their claim to fame.  Restaurant was cold and prices were high.  Oh well, we had chuckles over the 'harry' name, leading to hairy buffalo, hairy balls and googling Harry Baals of Indiana."}
{"text":"Someone suggested it for burgers ,it  was a dissapointment. Waiters and waitresses tend to cater to regulars and not what they suspect to be tourists or visitors. The bathroom could have been much cleaner"}
{"text":"The go-to place, they never disappoint! This is a well run establishment, and I can spot the good ones quickly..been in the restaurant business myself for 30+ years. This is a high volume location & they have perfected awesome customer service along with a great menu! I am always truly impressed!!"}
{"text":"Was in the area for the night and always heard a lot about this place and I always saw it driving past or while visiting the mall, but never checked it out but we were starving and I checked the menu out online and saw they had bison burgers so I was sold. 

The atmosphere is cool, it's dark, there's a big bar with multiple large flat screens playing sports and  music videos. They have Keno and a basketball game you can play too. 

I ordered a bbq bacon bison burger with waffle fries which ran me about $13 total, you can choose what meat you want, just so you're aware though, bison costs $3 more than beef which I didnt find out until the check came. It was seriously perfect though, sweet bbq sauce, just the right amount, stacked high with deep fried onion rings and veggies. The fries are good too, a little over cooked but still good. 

My girlfriend got 10 boneless wings, bbq ribs, and fries which only cost $10. She could only get through one rib and 3 wings before getting full so I tried the garlic parm wings and they were decent. 

Check this place out at least once if you've never had a bison burger."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a bite to eat after baseball game  Blue Moon special and buffalo burger.  ordered medium and more like medium well came to table  still not bad. Service was good waitress attentive"}
{"text":"Good place to watch your favorite team play on one of their many flat screen tvs! Service is AMAZING as well and drink/food specials make it worth your time/money! They claim to have \"The Best Bar Food\" around and from what I've had I'd agree with that!

Update. 4 to 5 stars. I went in last night to watch a baseball game and by chance they had trivia! I LOVE playing trivia as I'm pretty good at it! I ended up winning and got the top prize of $18 to use on my next visit. So I put the coins in my pocket but on my walk back to my hotel I guess I lost 4 of them! :( I went back in today to watch an afternoon game and I explained to my bartender of what happened and she came back with more coins! Talk about AWESOME service! This place has deferentially won my loyalty!

Doesn't hurt that they've got THE MOST BEAUTIFUL  bartenders in town! All are 10's for sure!!"}
{"text":"Harry Buffalo - what a location!  Resting comfortably beneath the shadow of Quicken Loans Arena and just a stone's throw from JACK Casino, this Americana-based eatery offers up plenty of opportunity for a good time via beverages and food.  Whether both and whether or not its pre or post game or just a good time.  It's February so I can only imagine (and I see photos) that this place is happ'nin for CAVS, Indians and all things CLEVELAND ROCKS CLEVELAND ROCKS.   I planted myself in the South Bar area and just so happened the weather in mid FEB '17 was in the 50s that evening.  Terrific to hear the car beeps, see folks walking to Quicken LA for Monster Truck show and enjoy the pretzel bites (tasty).  I saw others having good hearty portions of food; a friend had a cheeseburger and waffle fries that he devoured with pleasure.   I'm from Columbus - Cleveland stops aren't the norm but I'm thinking Harry Buffalo is a definite street-hopping spot to stop if I'm in town for gaming and fun.  DO IT!"}
{"text":"I have never, and probably will never, try the food here but I do come for the booze and to hang out with friends.  It is a nice sized bar and I never feel crowded when I'm here hanging out.  I don't think you can come in here with super-high expectations but it is your average bar with TV's and decent priced drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend's parents and visiting aunt and uncle. Everyone got the bison burger except for me (grilled chicken salad). Service was quick, well it wasn't too busy but I would say every staff I encountered seemed happy and that they liked each other. Learned they are gaining a new manager there so hopefully the vibe stays the same.
For the food: I heart burgers and would love to eat them every day if my cholesterol permitted. One of the burgers came out quite rare which the server fixed for us. Very generous size. Fries were a bit larger than I would like but I prefer the thin crispy kinds. Couldn't really tell the difference between beef and bison burger meat tho. Grilled chicken salad was delicious, nothing that I was over the top thrilled about that I would scream from the rooftops, but still good. Decent portion with expected amount of meat. 
This place was just decent for me, I didn't hate it but didn't love it. Ample parking is always a plus for me."}
