{"text":"Best new spot in Scottsdale! You won't be able to find anything like this. Seductive, tucked away, and upscale lounge. Brings the LA lifestyle to Arizona!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, I took my husband for his birthday and he had a blast. The hospitality was great, Xavier and the y'all guy that greet you outside were amazing. Thanks for having us, we will be coming back."}
{"text":"I had my birthday party at Blind Dragon Scottsdale and the entire staff went above and beyond to make it the best Birthday celebration yet! Xavier was an absolute pleasure to work with and made sure that everything flowed seamlessly. Any request I had  - he made it happen. My guests had a blast and I had such a blast! We can't wait to go back. Thank you! Thank you! So happy Blind Dragon is in Scottsdale. For sure - one of my favorite places to go in Scottsdale since I moved from LA! ROCK ON! You must go."}
{"text":"Gorgeous lounge! There are candles and lanterns everywhere as well as beautiful art and decor. It has a lounge area but it also has private rooms for karaoke. So not only is it good for a date, but it's also good for a private party. The staff was very welcoming and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Staff was rude and pretentious. Hardly the best way to make any type of good impression as a new location. Overpriced cocktails, \"bites\", and unfriendly staff. Music was subpar. No wonder there was no line... You're better off going to the fun places in Old Town."}
{"text":"I love the decor and laid back vibe at this place.  Unfortunately, this seems to be mostly a vacant spot as there are not enough customers.  Waitresses were very dressed very sex in lingerie outfits.  Nice!!  My party thought he waitresses were sexy and I'm on the only guy.  lol  I do love the dancers here.  They are very good.  Professional quality.  So they have these dancers, one of whom is definitely Asian dress up in Japanese garb and dance on-stage.  They are so stylish, aesthetic, and move so well.  They come in around 10-11 PM.  I hope the crowd here picks up.  It's a nice, quiet relaxing lounge environment.  Service is very good."}
{"text":"This truly is a hidden gem! The facility is beautiful. The karaoke room was spacious and the there were SOOO many songs to pick from. We got bottle service (which was a very reasonable price) and the girls were very sweet and helpful. I would 100% recommend coming here to celebrate any occasion!  I am so glad I picked this place to celebrate my birthday. It was fabulous!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful! I love feeling like I stepped into Asia right in Old Town Scottsdale! The staff is wonderful, the Asian inspired bites are amazing, and the karaoke rooms are always memorable! Definitely coming back to rent a room, again!"}
{"text":"Rented a karaoke room on Saturday for 10 ladies and had a blast. Great selection of songs and good acoustics. Drinks were goooddd. Staff was super friendly and did a great job keeping up with our drinks.   We really had a great time. We would definitely make a return visit.  If you are looking for something different and fun to do on a Saturday night, I would definitely say give Blind Dragon a try."}
{"text":"This was far and away the best experience I've had in Scottsdale. Great selection of Karaoke songs. Such a wonderful experience. The management was so accommodating and helpful. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We've been coming here more and more frequently, great drinks and the best karaoke in town. Little secret, if you don't wanna do the karaoke room the normal bar area has great music with a live DJ. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love this place, great atmosphere great food and drinks. Definitely my go to spot before a night in old town. Theresa is a great host and always tends to my parties needs"}
{"text":"I was here for the soft & grand opening.  It was amazing!  The food is fire & the drinks are unique and actually delicious.  Especially the cotton candy looking drink.  The servers, bartenders, managers, the ENTIRE STAFF are pros and super nice.  I never thought an upscale lounge/karaoke could possibly work, but somehow magic happens.  The atmosphere/decor is so classy and inviting.  Absolutely nothing like the other Old Town Bars; so plain and cookie cutter, the comparison is miles.  Its unexpected, its unexplainable, its...its...well...its pretty %$&@'ing cool!  10/10, would recommend"}
