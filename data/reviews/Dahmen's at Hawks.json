{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos which were the worst I've ever had anywhere.  My spouse had a burger & fries... after waiting longer than one would expect, both meals were served luke warm.  Later that night throughout the whole next day was so sick to my stomach.  Be sure to order something that is thoroughly cooked through and served hot if you eat here.  
Side note: the bathroom faucet never gets hot, wonder about that when someone from the kitchen has to wash their hands and return to work."}
{"text":"Dynamite!  Great service, friendly staff.  Smoked wings are killer. Good salads. Excellent Quesadillas. Fish fry on Friday nights is also great. Don't forget the pizza, love the thin crust."}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with some friends to watch the Euro Cup final. When we arrived they did not have the audio on but the bartender happily switched it over for us. It was 2:00 on a Sunday and it was pretty empty aside from a few groups of people who, for the most part, were all there to watch the game. There are TVs a plenty and lots of seating-plenty of high tops, seats at the bar as well as a section in the back with regular tables. It's located in the Hawks Landing golf course clubhouse. Just follow the signs off Midtown and curve around to behind the pool. You'll enter near the pro shop and head down the hallway to your left.

Service was prompt and friendly. The food menu is pretty varied-everything from the typical appetizers (wings, curds, nachos) to soup, salads, pizza, burgers as well as a Friday Fish Fry. And fear not vegetarians, while there are not a ton of options, the menu does include a veggie platter, a veggie burger, salads and of course, meatless pizzas.

Draft beer options were pretty limited to New Glarus, Capitol, Lake Louie and a few others including Karben 4's Fantasy Factory. A wide variety of styles but not a huge selection if that's what you are looking for.

Our party was all very pleased with the food. We didn't have the smoked wings but others nearby did and they looked awesome. One in our party had the southern burger which was a bacon cheeseburger topped with onion straws (though more like cut up onion rings rather than those really skinny onion strings I was expecting), pulled pork and BBQ sauce. Yes, it was a beast. I tried some of the pulled pork that was laid across the top and it was fantastic. Up there with some of the better pulled pork I've ever had-including dedicated BBQ places. I will be back for sure just to have their pulled pork sandwich. They claim it as a bit of a specialty and I have no doubt it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Great views! I'd call this a hidden gem of a place because I keep hearing people say they had no idea this place existed. I came here on a weeknight and was a little put off when the beer I ordered hadn't been served in a while, so the menu wasn't up to date. I've heard good things about their Friday fish fry. However, I ordered a Cuban sandwich and it was pretty good, but not what I had in mind. The sandwich had a slice of pork in it, which was a bit dry for my liking. My friends both ordered salads, which looked really good and huge! The service was good and as I mentioned, great views!"}
{"text":"Yes!! Staff and guests are awesome and welcoming. Riley, the bartender was awesome. He comped me some drinks that threw me over the edge. I look forward to hang in out here again. Thanks for the great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Dahmen's has some definite highlights on their menu. My favorites include the club sandwich (come hungry), both the wing offerings, and of course their pizza. I'm not a golfer or a sports fan but there is still fun to be had at Dahmen's!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery (via grub hub) from Dahmen's twice in the last two days. The food is just that good! I will definitely have to physically stop in to check out the restaurant space, and other food items."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Awesome food and service.  The patio is our fav place to have cocktails after a round of golf.  If you get the chance to try it out, have the chicken wings!  Amazing!"}
