{"text":"I'll never go here again! Although these guys tried to do their best in copying Roti Cuisine of India but the flavor of the food is wayyy off! Worst roti I've ever had =(, do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, always made to order, and a decent vegetarian selection. Cheap too, with large portions."}
{"text":"They make beautiful food! I've tried most of the items on the menu and been impressed every time. They use fresh herbs I'm pretty sure they grow themselves. The spice combinations are fresh and pleasant and well balanced, not overpowering or too bland. Mild is indeed mild and spicy is indeed spicy. They seem eager to please so you can customize anything if you want. Large portions and always made to order.  Most of the negative reviews are due to people not getting what they expected... this restaurant is really more like an Indian fusion establishment since they have their own unique spin on Roti. So if you're looking for biz-as-usual butter chicken you might be surprised.  I'm so happy these guys are in my neighbourhood to offer a healthy (and somehow cheaper!) alternative to fast food pizza."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is fresh, hot (both spiciness and temperature) and flavourful. It takes a bit longer than standard take-out but that's because it is made to order. I've only had walk-in so don't know about the delivery but the walk-in is excellent.  I go with the mutter paneer roti (veggie usually) and the quality is very high. This place is worth a visit if you're in the area...or even if you're not!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, just finished the Lamb Korma Roti, with a side of Vegetable Biryani and the house special Chicken Tenders. Initially ordered for dine-in, our server let us know it would take about 20 minutes, no problem.   We were extremely satisfied with the food, I would give a 5 star rating but it seems that the kitchen was backed up on orders, people were coming in for pick up and their order was either not ready or forgotten about.  I would definitely recommend dine-in, just to reassure that your order is not forgotten. The food is really worth the wait, we'll be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Been a huge fan of Indian food especially Roti's.  Snahi's popped up on my Uber eats app recently and I thought I would try it out since it wasn't too far.  I called them and ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala Roti and an order of Chicken Biriyani.  Ready in 20 minutes.  The actual restaurant is located in a quiet area of North York, extremely clean and easy to locate.  The food was great compared to other Indian restaurants I've had.  There was generous amounts of chicken in both the Roti and Biriyani and both were extremely flavourful.  Both were ordered extra spicy and I wasn't disappointed.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.  Highly recommend! 5*"}
{"text":"Took 2 hours to come via uber eats, which is unacceptable. Things were okay until i bit into a vile disgusting long hair just two bites into my roti. I will never order from this disgusting restaurant again. Its very easy to not have hair in your food."}
{"text":"While you can eat in, the furniture here is rather bare bones. The restaurant seems to mostly cater to takeout orders, which I do on a somewhat regular basis. Everything about this place is consistent: the employee will ask how spicy you want each dish, and it takes about 15 minutes for them to complete your order for pickup. You get a very generous serving of your order that is always hot and fresh. They don't give cutlery by default, because the expectation is you're eating at home and not wasting plastic. While I won't call this place authentic Indian, the food is delicious regardless.  The restaurant is wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"The good: The curries (veg) I've had have been flavourful. Decent portions and good prices.  The so so: Pakoras tasted like reheated frozen from the box."}
{"text":"was about to order thru Uber Eats and then decided that I am being extremely lazy and this place is like a 7 minute drive. Saved myself the $5 and called into pickup.  It took a while for the phone call to go thru, I think on my 3rd attempt. Thank the world that I am resilient and wouldn't take no for an answer. The man who answered the phone answered my question, \"what is more spicy? butter chicken or chicken tikka?\" - So i went with the Chicken Tikka Masala and was instructed that they are really busy and it would take about 30 minutes.  I arrive half an hour later and they advised that my order is almost ready. The place is really small- with about 5 tables. Parking lot is tricky to get in and out of.   My food was ready and the aluminum foil container it came in was super hot- by the time I drove him - which takes about 7 minutes. It remained in the same condition.  As soon as I opened the lid of the container- I knew it was a match. The roti was perfectly cooked and as i sliced into it I could smell the aroma. They made is really spicy. I am writing the review the next day and getting head sweats about the memory of how spicy it was. No complaints- exactly what I wanted.  Overall- it is not at the level as Roti house of India and Gandhi Cuisine, which serve the same products downtown. However- as the only location this part of town to serve this item. They definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Not sure where in India these guys are from but when I ordered the butter chicken which I've had hundreds of times before all over the world, I got a dish that was NOT at all resembling butter chicken.  The \"butter chicken\" wasn't great and neither was the naan/roti. Bottom line, there are plenty of indian restaurants around and this one is just not cutting it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Saag Paneer roti and Lamb biryani for take out.  Food was very flavourful. Asked for it spicy and it was spicy! The spinach in the saag paneer was cooked almost like a stew a lost some of its texture but I didn't mind it as the flavour made up for it. Lamb wasn't as tender as I would have liked but not tough at all.  Small area to eat in. They take approximately 15 minutes to make your order so I suggest calling ahead before picking up.   Will be eating here again as I would like to see this place flourish in neighbourhood and the flavour is so good."}
{"text":"Just ordered the butter chicken roti for takeout. With a $2 tip, i spent about $14- not bad.  The roti is big and comes in a piping hot container- not complaining, at least its fresh. The roti is so big that I could only eat half of it- very generous portions!  I was disappointed that cutlery was not offered, however, a plastic fork would have likely melted in this heat.  I should have asked for spicy, because the medium was kinda plain. The last time I asked an Indian place for \"spicy\" I was breathing fire for hours, so wasn't feeling brave enough to test these guys today :p Overall it was good. Very fresh. Lots of filling. Not dry at all.  Food was ready in 15 minutes, as they had said it would be.  The gentleman in the store was friendly and polite. Will definitely be coming back to try out some of the other menu items. The price for the amount of food is impressive... this is quite possibly the biggest roti I have ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"I've heard great reviews about this place and was super excited to order from them.   I ended up waiting a total of 2.5 hours before my food arrived on delivery (by this time it was already 9:30pm). It is absolutely ridiculous to be waiting 2.5 hours for food, and when I contacted customer service to check where the driver was, the restaurant owner lied about contacting me to let me know that he had called to tell me the order was going to be late, he did not! This is poor customer service on the restaurant/owner, if he could not fulfill the order in time he should have warned the customer/suggest a cancellation or be HONEST about the delivery time, and also not blaming it on traffic when he is only a 20 minute drive from my house.   On to the food, I had ordered $27 (with tax) worth of food - butter chicken roti, chicken biryani and veg pakora, the positive: food arrived hot. The negative: food was tasteless and bland and nothing special, just big chunks of chicken breast and potatoes. I will never order from this restaurant again! Better to go elsewhere if you're craving for authentic Indian dishes."}
{"text":"The Baigan Bharta Roti described as \"Chargrilled eggplant tempered with Indian spices\" is not as advertised. I love love love baigan bharta, it's one of my favorite dishes. What I got was a weird yellow super creamy gravy with potoaes and peas and no trace (in flavour or colour) of eggplant. So heavy on the cream that for me it was not edible.(disclosure I'm not at all a fan of cream heavy dishes). I called to complain and they just told me that the 'eggplant is pureed'. Yes I know this. I've eaten variations of this dish literally a thousand times in every Indian restaurant in the city and surrounding area. I did not enjoy this variation. The description on the menu needs to be revised. The roti was also a bit underdone and the filling very liquidy causing the roti to be slimey.   The cauliflower appetizer was good. The the dal roti and mixed veg korma roti were also good."}
