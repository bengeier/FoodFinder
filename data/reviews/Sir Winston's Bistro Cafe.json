{"text":"Who would've thought that Sir Winston's a hidden little gem in the Toyota Dealership! It's funny to think that when we walked into the dealership, the salesperson walked up to us and we immediately said sorry, we're here for Sir Winston's. I'm a little embarrassed I must say but not embarrassed enough to try their tasty food! I heard about this place from my fianc√©'s coworkers so we decided to try it out!

Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. We went here on a Saturday around lunchtime and omg.. they only had one dish to serve...Chicken Kofta. A part of me wanted to walk out and the other half wanted to just try it. Luckily for them, I was satisfied. The portion was very generous, it came with one big chicken Kofta, rice, Greek potatoes, a dollop of tzatziki sauce and Caesar salad. The taste verdict: thumbs up! Flavourful and kept me full! 

I would give it another go...on a weekday for sure."}
{"text":"Inside of Meadowvale Toyota there is a great little Italian bistro with fresh, homemade food that is cheap yet made with quality ingredients. I was introduced to this gem by one of my co-workers who kept raving about the food here, not what you would expect at a car dealership. There isn't even any signs advertising that you could order some lunch here so it is all word of mouth. 

I have been here multiple times and tried a variety of dishes such as fish and chips, veal sandwich and homemade pastas. They have daily specials and on my most recent visit I had the penne with sausage and red peppers. It was so tasty and the portion kept me full and satisfied. Also, for an added kick, be sure to ask for their chili oil. 

Chef Tony and his staff are always friendly and accommodating, always with smiles on their faces ready to help every customer, everything a simple yet great mom and pop shop should be."}
