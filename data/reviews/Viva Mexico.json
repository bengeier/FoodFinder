{"text":"Vraiment formidable! C'était très savoureux et j'ai trouvé que le prix était très honnête! On est loin des trois amigos!"}
{"text":"Just had the Chilaquiles at Viva Mexico. Fantastic, having flashbacks of Oaxaca. Will be back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday afternoon for a snack of Tostada de camaron & sangria Senorial.

I loved the colorful decor and the personal service. The flavors were fresh and vibrant.

Despite being in a semi-basement very light and airy feel due to use of large windows and mirror.

If I find myself in that neighborhood I might drop in again."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! I just tried this place for the first time today and was very pleasantly surprised. There is a dearth of good mexican eateries in Toronto (possibly in Canada in general) and so i usually dont expect to be impressed by the ones that are here. This place is great though. The owners are from San Luis Potosi and know what they are doing. I had the chicken mole which was delightful. For starters, i had yucatan lime chicken soup which was very delicious. My friend had the chicken enchiladas and was also very happy with his meal. Great service, great decor. Again super yummy and authentic fare. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to order this one day at work for lunch. The portions were very small and the Enchilada that I got was quite dry. Another thing was the sauces had very little flavor. I did not go in the actual restaurant so I have nothing to say about the atmosphere or the staff. There are lots of great Mexican options in Toronto so I probably will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Oh this is a great Mexican spot. I don't think they have been open long (a few months?). It feels like a mom and pop operation. Our waiter (who I think own the place?) didn't speak much english. but we got by with pointing at the menu. Its very reason prices, around $10 for a filling meal.

I got a chicken burrito with side salad and rice. It was so great, well flavoured, but not too spicy. If you want extra kick, just smother your meal with their salsa! The burrito itself was huge, I was quite impressed with myself for finishing it.

I would go back here for a casual lunch, either on my own or with friends!"}
{"text":"My husband and two young daughters went to Viva Mexico for dinner and LOVED the food.  They have amazing special tacos and delish guacamole.  The girls enjoyed the enormous burritos and flautas.  It's in a kind of funny basement but the place is very clean and charming.  The owners are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Went  for dinner tonight, very disappointed, most mexican places start you off with a basket of nacho chips with a dish of salsa, not here! The food was small quanitys, my husband had a small basket of nachos, about the size of a cereal bowl for 10.oo! And soggy! my chicken enchiladas were tasty but so small and cold. Will not go back there!"}
{"text":"The service here is good and friendly.  The food was somewhat pretty good, though our fried rice was a little dry.  Their nachos and guacamole was abolutely delicious, you gotta try it.  Their chimichanga could use a bit more sour cream and guacamole.  The environment is nice and intimate.  Overall, i recommend this place for a great evening on the town.  Prices are also pretty good."}
