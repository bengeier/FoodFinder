{"text":"Always looking for a good place for fish. hubby and I went here last nite for the first time. Have never been in this part of Gastonia. Off the beaten path. The place was very nice. I had the Alaskan white fish broiled came with a very generous salad and a side item which was sweet potato.   Also came with delicious garlic cheese biscuit and hush puppies Delicious! love my biscuit. ! What can I say great prices, great food and service was great ! If it was closer in where I live . We would go there once a week.   Must come back for the delicious giant cakes. looks like a meal in itself!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden in the country side of Gastonia...who would've there would be a seafood restaurant in this part..but here it was. The menu had a great selection of seafood and for those who are not into seafood..there is an excellent selection of pasta and steaks all at a reasonable price. I had the crab cakes, which was delicious. I took away 1 star because service was not that great our waitress was not attentive to our table..and I took away another star because the salad bar looked a bit messy. Over all the food was good and the price was good. It was comfortable. I will definitely come back and give it a second try."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  However, as my wife and I were at the counter paying, the owner appeared to be physically assaulting a girl in one of the booths.  My wife went ballistic and started screaming at him to get his hands off her.  He said \"It's ok, she's my daughter.\"  Several of the wait staff ran over and apologized to us, and told us that's not the first time it had happened.  That's really good behavior in front of your customers..."}
{"text":"Well worth stopping here. Large portions reasonable price well prepared. Weekday was not crowded. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Amber Jack and on this occasion the waitress suggested a steak so I decided to try something different and it was horrible. The steak came out completely dried out and tough. I was so dis-appointed that I wrote to the restaurant the next day to let them know what happened so that they could at least be aware that perhaps they need to work on steak preparation. I have to this day never heard back. Obviously not only can they not cook steaks, but they are also unable to return emails with concerns. It was the last time we will ever go there."}
{"text":"It was ok I got a catfish fillet salt pepper and shrimp salt pepper the shrimp was overcooked and the catfish taste like 3 weeks old but the service was great idk if I will go back"}
{"text":"Great steaks, seafood, and even Italian. The best chicken parmigiana I've ever had!!! The bar has a nice atmosphere, especially like the ship theme, with nice draft beer selection and good prices. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"We have a family get together once a month. Amberjacks has become a favorite spot. We have been very impressed with plentiful amounts of delicious food and excellent service. We were there on Sat 6/23/18 . My cousin has gone to the men's room a man came in used the facility and left. Since he didnt bother to wash his hands my cousin watched to see if he was a patron  or employee. He went went straight into the kitchen.(Not  good) My cousin did speak to the manager. She then went to the kitchen and came back after a bit. She went into her office and closed the door. We feel some type of acknowledgement from the manager  would have be nice. Sadly we wont be back."}
{"text":"Amber Jack's is a family favorite.  The expansive surf and turf menu is bound to have something everyone likes and the casual atmosphere ensures that everyone will be comfortable.  The converted general store is popular with customers young and old. They have a charming collection of both novelty and popular candy in barrels and buckets waiting right by the front door.  Amber Jack's is great for big groups as there is plenty of seating and parking. My large family has never had to wait for a table the few times I've been here. Generally the service is really good.   We had a little trouble getting our check last time, but I applaud our waitress for getting 10 people's meals right.   As soon as you sit down you will be greeted with cheese biscuits and hush puppies.  I do think its a little annoying that they don't provide plates for your bread starter, but I can eat with my hands I suppose.  All entrees come with a side and a choice of a second side or a trip to the salad bar.  The salad bar is a little limited in toppings, however the mixed greens I had tasted very fresh.  I recommend the Greek dressing in an unmarked bottle at the end of the salad bar.   The entrees are varied from steak to fish to pasta.  I ordered the crab cakes with potatoes au gratin.  The crab cakes had a bit more filling than I typically prefer, but they were really flavorful otherwise.  A popular dish at the table was grilled mahi mahi. On the menu, most fish comes broiled or fried, but you can ask for basically any of it grilled and the goodness of your meal will increase ten fold. Another big hit was the special buffalo mac and cheese side.  I don't love spicy food, but everyone at the table raved about it.    No one in the fam saved room for dessert, but the case of cakes and cheese cakes looked ridiculous.  The red velvet cake is basically a foot tall and the tiramisu cheese cake is apparently the best thing Amber Jack's has going. Also, lunch here is CHEAP.  Overall, the family has always been pleased with the service and food at Amber Jack's and I'm sure we will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Cool place. Laid back. Good food  D rink and food  specials.  More restaurant than bar. I would go back."}
{"text":"Chaotic mess!!!!  Went for Sunday brunch, this was our first time there.  The line was so long at the buffet and everyone seemed confused as to what to do (ppl jumping the line).  Half the trays were empty or close to.  Food was very basic, nothing special.  I think I ate (and I'm guessing at this) a frozen Salisbury steak patty???  Had some collard greens that tasted like they were dumped right out the can.  Staff just sitting around talking. My husband and I ate one small plate each and decided it wasn't worth fighting the line again for seconds or even desert.  When I went to pay there were two cashiers neither of which acted like they cared to wait on me, in fact the older lady just looked around me like I wasn't even there! Maybe the menu is better I don't know but the buffet is a stressful nightmare."}
{"text":"Hard to find a good fried fish place.  Very clean nice waitress. Very big menu. Food was very good. Was too full to order desserts but cakes looked very good only bad thing seated at kitchen door was very loud. Would go back but sit another place. Lol"}
{"text":"Been on my radar for a couple of years but was in Gastonia on Sunday and wanted lunch so it because an obvious choice.  Sunday is a bit different from the norm. Rest of the week is order off of the menu which is generally a Surf and Turf type menu but Sunday is Buffet.  Walked in a bit after two because by that time, I thought the Church rush would have died off. Boy was I wrong. 15 - 20 minute wait and it was not just a Church rush but rather the place is that popular.  Was seated near the bar and a very harried waited finally asked for my beverage order which or course was half and half , sweet tea and unsweetened tea to get the proper level of sweet but or course, offset with Lemon.  He disappeared but i later flagged him down only to find that this was only a buffet and I need to go to the  buffet and grab a plate. Obviously my first time here so my error.  The buffet is divided into two lines. One is cold and mainly salads and it looked very good. I wanted Seafood so I went with the hot bar. I loaded up on fish, chicken, meatloaf, Swiss Steak, Shrimp, Beef Liver, Chicken Livers etc.  Good thing I did not have my cholesterol checked the next day.  Everything was great and while I had an overworked server, he did come through.  Next time I will know the ropes but even so, this was a good experience and I will be back"}
{"text":"Classic family surf & turf restaurant with salad bar. Definitely local favorite, be ready for 30 minute wait on Saturday night. Start off with bowl of hush puppies and garlic butter biscuits. Broiled flounder done just right with flavorful seasoning. Fried jumbo shrimp heavy on batter, still good. Boiled peel shrimp with cayenne pepper but not overpowering like Cajun style. Crab cakes seasoned well and actually had crabmeat. We will go back and try turf next time. If you are in mood for Red Lobster or Longhorn Steakhouse try Amber Jacks local first!"}
{"text":"$21.95 for soggy, luke warm fried food. Really?? I called in an order consisting of fried pickles and a seafood combo plate. In ONE to go container, they stuffed a mountain of 4 types of soggy seafood, a baked potato and 8 hush puppies. I got there right as they were bringing it out to the carry-out station from the kitchen and only had a 10 min ride home. So, there's really no excuse. Unreal. I will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"We were there this past Sunday,September 24,2017 at 3:45pm.We knew the buffet ended at 4:00pm so we waited to order from the menu.We have never eaten at the lunch buffet but if anyone observed what we did,no one would ever eat at this buffet.We had planned to go this coming Sunday and eat the buffet but not after what we saw.We were sitting right at the kitchen beside the buffet.Two Hispanic males were cleaning and taking down everything.They were putting the Clean dishes left on the bar onto the floor and then placing them  onto a rack with the other clean dishes.Their hands were all over the dishes without rubber gloves on and can you imagine how dirty the floor was.We were right there at them so they kept turning around looking at us.I am sure they heard me talking about what they were doing.I cannot believe what I saw.I would have spoken to a manager but a manager did not come around to ask how we enjoyed our meal.I have worked in food service and would have been fired if I had even thought of putting clean dishes on the floor.No one seem to be watching  them except the people in my party.They knew we were talking about it because we could have reached out and almost touched them.They were that close to our booth.This is so GROSS....WILL NOT EAT THE BUFFET AFTER SEEING THIS!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second I've ordered take out from this place and this will definitely be the LAST! For starters when I called to make the order the person on the phone wasn't familiar with the menu and didn't even supply me with a total after asking for one. I still gave them the benefit of doubt and went to  pick up the food.  Once I got there I realized that the actual take out area is out of order and that I had to go around to the other side of the restaurant.  I didn't let that bother me since I thought the food would be worth it...I was WRONG!   The food was horrible for the most part. There was absolutely no flavor, so I had to season it myself!  My order was missing the salad that it advertised and one of the condiment containers had mold growing, YUCK! I won't be returning and I would advise others to stay away also."}
{"text":"I knew the signs out front looked familiar, it's the same owners as the old Amber House on N Tryon. Lots of the same plus more. Free soup for lunch and salad bar at dinner. Sunday buffet, but I haven't been. Recommend beef tips, they were perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"I have eaten at amber jacks a few times and the food has always been great.  I have tried the Aloha Chicken and I believe it was a Greek Salad with Chicken.  The grilled chicken itself is wonderful and I highly recommend that.  The dressing for the greek salad also looked homemade.  Also, the prices are very reasonable, most items with atleast one side are about 10 dollars or less.  HOWEVER.... after the last time I went there I woke up the next morning at about 3 am and felt terrible!  To keep things short... quick dash to the bathroom!  I really hope this was not due to their great tasting chicken!  So the food, prices and customer service was great but not worth it if I get sick!"}
{"text":"Our family was hunting and wandering around for something different than our normal places to eat.  I have always been a Longhorn girl and of course the kids wanted McDonald's (blah blah). We came across Amberjacks. Best decision we made.  Love the old general store feel when we walked in. Our waitress was amazing and they had something for everyone of us. I had prime rib. Hands down the best I have ever had.  Hubby had beef tips, kid one had cheeseburger and kid two had ziti. All of us were happily satisfied. Reasonable priced.  Definitely a go to from now on."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed! The Fried Seafood Combo was warm at best, and the broiled combo... the scallops were not cooked thoroughly and the shrimp was like rubber. The service was fair at best. Had to ask twice for cocktail sauce and tarter sauce and once served the waitress came back only once. Would not recommend this restaurant. This was our second time there and this time was worse than the first time. I'll go to Twin Tops for seafood from now on."}
{"text":"Still going regularly and love the jumbo fried shrimp they are huge.   Flounder great too.  The cakes are hard to leave without a to go box.  The reason 4 stars not 5 is because a few times we were seated and forgotten a while when it was slow.  Shrimp worth it."}
{"text":"I mainly get take out from here. The food is not too bad, but the staff that answers the phone is really unprofessional and can't get a to go order right to save their lives. When you call and bring it to their attention, it's obvious by their tone they really don't care. If attention to detail is important to you, then you may want to go elsewhere and definitely don't order take out."}
{"text":"I had heard from a co-worker that the Sunday brunch/lunch was awesome. So we went, and I was very disappointed to see very limited amount of food on the buffet, which was $9.50 per person. Salisbury steak was horrible.  Fried squash was very greasy and no flavor. Mac N Cheese was ok.  Veggies were eh, I've had much better. Atmosphere was nice.  Clean. Won't be returning here any time soon.  I've experienced much better at different places."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood and steak. It was a great value for the amount of food you get. I really enjoyed the hush puppies and the fried flounder and jumbo shrimp was great. Some of the breading was a little saltier than others, but nothing was over cooked. The plate that I ordered offered a fried deviled crab which you couldn't taste any crab. I didn't see or taste even the smallest bit of crab or imitation crab in the shell. My friend had a steak with potato. His steak appeared to be cooked correctly and he said it had great flavor. Overall, the value is great and the food is good. I really enjoyed how spacious the place was and the decor. I'm sure that when it gets full there's still enough place to move around. The bathrooms are a good size but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is a must for my family when we come to visit Gastonia. The seafood is fresh with an awesome family atmosphere. The price is more than reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. We ALL had to go boxes that qualify as full second meals. The hush puppies never stop. I had a combo plate of catfish filet salt and peppered, fried oysters and green shrimp with a loaded baked potato and coleslaw. I was not disappointed and full to the max. It's the place to go for down home seafood in my book."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a jewel.  Tues.  -  All you can eat Snow Crab Legs..wonderful.  Large portions, excellent service.  First place I have seen Shrimp Louie on the menu since moving up north."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for lunch yesterday. Guy on the phone took my order and was pleasant enough. I pull up and entered through the take out door, since I ordered take out, only to stand in the dark for about 5 minutes to eventually be told that take out orders called in before 4pm are handled at the front. Okay... thanks for the sign to let me know(no sign anywhere). I get to the front to pick up my food and even though there were three people up front only one was actually working, the male, not the two females. While the male is taking my money the two females proceed to whisper in each other's ears. One of the ladies finally went to go get my food and came back to give it to me and didn't say a word. Just handed me the food and couldn't even make eye contact, which is probably the result of me giving them both the stare down while they were whispering to each other. Also, I always have to check my tartar sauce before leaving because five out of six times, it's blue cheese. The food was good and I received my food relatively quickly but customer service seems near rock bottom. Did no one teach these girls manners and that whispering, especially in front of customers is rude?"}
{"text":"No kidding folks, my bud was chowing down on a broiled flounder, fully cooked, bit down on a wood screw embedded in the fish!  Not on the fish, inside the fish!  Never again and I live right across the street from the place.  Needless to say that plate was carried away very quickly.  Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"We live just down the way from this restaurant and for the most part, our service and food has been fairly good. Tonight we showed up with a large party and placed our name on the list to be seated, or so I thought. After 45 minutes had passed (We were told 30 minutes) we asked the hostess and she did not have our names at all. She must have erased it and tried to cover up. There was another associate there that stated our names were on the list but still he sat two other parties. Both of the hostesses were rude and copped an attitude with our family. I asked that the manager come out and he acted as though it was somehow our fault. We left and are choosing to spend our money elsewhere! We USED to eat here all the time. We will not be coming back and the thing about telling 10 friends will not be enough. We are telling everyone, do not frequent this restaurant. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else. They do not appreciate their customers and have no idea how to achieve good customer service."}
{"text":"For the price you can't beat this place. A little out of the way but if your hungry for seafood this is the place. Wish the salad bar had a little more to offer -'pretty basic but overall very pleased. Service has been good and good for groups."}
{"text":"First visit very recently.  I will be back!  I had the broiled combination plate, blackened with a baked potato.  It was delicious!  The hush puppies are VERY good!  Service was very attentive.  Looking forward to trying more items on the menu.  This establishment is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"To the moron running this show...  EVER HEARD OF AN AIR CONDITIONER?!  My daughter was out with her dad on Father's Day and they decided to go to Amber Jack.  Well, that day whoever was running the show SURELY must have realized that, on Father's Day, the restaurant would be running at capacity all day; but for some strange reason the Mr. Krabs of a manager/(possible) owner didn't feel the need to run the air conditioner any lower to accommodate the crowd.  As a result, the patrons AND the seafood got to stew in 85-degree heat ALL DAY.  My daughter was one of the victims of the tightwad; she got sick at the table from the awful heat.  Needless to say, no one ate their food, and my daughter had to sit there, miserable, while the manager took his sweet time to \"address the issue.\"  Address the issue my butt..  When the manager was called he BALKED at taking the uneaten meals off their check so they could just go home and get her treated!  It was HIS fault to begin with!  That guy was soooo very lucky I wasn't anywhere in the vicinity when this happened!    As it stands I live in an area with a FAR SUPERIOR fish camp to this DUMP.  I ate here ONCE, a few years ago when we still lived in Gastonia, and once was all it took for me.  Heat lamp shrimp is not my thing.  The local restaurant in Fort Mill is yummy and GUESS WHAT?  They have this miraculous little invention called AIR CONDITIONING!  Look into it, Amber Jack!"}
{"text":"Ordered the plate with fish, scallops, shrimp and fries. Overall the taste was great. Everything was fried okay, the only problem I had was the breading not sticking to the seafood. The salad bar was available for a small fee, but after I paid about $35-40 for the combo plate and a drink only for one person I was a little turned back to add the salad bar so Ultimately I removed that. The environment has a \"home near the water\" feeling and it's very clean on the inside. I would recommend for \"celebration's\" based on the prices of meals."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, nice atmosphere, service is usually good. The clam chowder is very,very good not going to set the world on fire but a solid choice for seafood in Gaston Co."}
{"text":"There nachos are amazing! They are like my favorite thing to get when we go there! The salads are awesome when I was working to call in and get! I love amber jacks!  They are great customer service and kind personnel!! Fast service and the food is even better the next day lol!! Go to amber jacks you can every add to the nachos chicken or steak!! Which I do and it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"Just had our weekly Amberjack fix. And as usual it was well worth the 45 min. both way's drive. Just wish I wasn't driving so I could take a full belly nap. I had the Beef Tips and they were wonderful. Move than I could handle with 2 sides.  My friend had the Alaskan White Fish (s&p) ate every piece. It's all good we had the Chicken Wings one time and love the Pasta dishes. The place is clean and the service is wonderful. But we all know what make the meal the Sweet Ice Tea. It hit's the spot."}
{"text":"This was my first time here,  i wished i had found this place sooner!  I had the steak tips for lunch, FANTASTIC! I'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Amberjack Seafood twice now and it's has been great both times! We took a friend with us Saturday and she loved it also. I had a ribeye and fried jumbo shrimp, she had blackened Mahi-Mahi and our friend had calabash shrimp. Everything was cooked well and came out in a reasonable time.   The last time we went I had the fried seafood platter and it was great.   We thought the prices were pretty good for the quality of the food. The service was excellent! We can wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here today and ate the buffet. It was so awesome and they had so many different options. They didn't have a dessert bar but everything else was great. It was 10 per person and it was worth it. It's a super cute place and they have a ton of candy as soon as you walk in. Our waitress was so friendly."}
{"text":"I go here with my family because they love that fish stuff. I ain't gonna lie, it is pretty good though. Hit this place up peeps"}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Easy location. Only place around with fried clams. Hard to find down here in the south for some reason!"}
{"text":"The buffet it priced excellent on Sundays. I've ordered the Ribeye and peel 'n' eat shrimp and is done quite well. Tried to bring some friends here for lunch on a Saturday, but they didn't open until after 4pm and I should have checked first. Otherwise, the food is excellent."}
{"text":"I recall going here when it was Lineberegers fishcamp. Today my family celebrated my Mothers 80 birthday. We had close to 50 people join. We were able to reserve a special room & had two dedicated wait staff & a special menu. We were well taken care of & the food was excellent. I had the salad bar & the beef tips, well seasoned & delicious."}
