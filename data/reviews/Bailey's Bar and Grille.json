{"text":"everything was messy! The food... was terrible. We went there with a group of only four of us... but it is doubtful that we will ever return. I took one bite of my wings and pushed them away and almost threw up. I love wings!!! I have never had wings that I did not like until I went here. The waitress never once asked about our food or I would have told her. No one at the table finished their food or even came close to finishing it. I'm glad I paid for food that wasn't even edible. The fries were very good. The service just may have been worse than the food. I ask for ranch i get bleu cheese, ask for water and get a soda, ask for salt don't get it, ask for celery twice and don't get it. I love supporting local businesses but it is hard to do so when the food and the service is terrible. I contacted them and they chose to just ignore me about this. So here you go."}
{"text":"Okay.. Here's a little secret about Elyria.  Not sure why the last reviewer left a single star for this vibrant watering hole. I have to say.. People here are amazing. Its basically an Interacial Cheers. Where everyone knows everyone. Good people great atmosphere especially for the Dart tournaments.   Food must try!!! The wings in this place beats any wing joint I've been to. They will mix things up for ya. However you want it.  My lips enjoyed a mix of wimpy garlic ranch and parm style wings. LET MY INNER FATTY TELL YOU!!!! Nom nom to the nom. So he damn good.   If you want Sammy with a kick try the Bobby Shannon. Chicken Sammy with heat!!   Basically, come in for great food and people. O yeah if your just hungry and have to run.. There's a drive thru!! Cheeeyaaaasss I said it DRIVE THRU..   NUFF SAID."}
{"text":"Bailey's is amazing! I don't mind driving from Parma to Elyria for those wings! My boyfriend doesn't ever stop talking about them! Love love love the Garlic Parm!"}
