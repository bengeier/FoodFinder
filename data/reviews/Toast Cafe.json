{"text":"I really enjoy Toast.  I go there at least once a month.  It's clean, great atmosphere, and great service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. No wonder there is a wait and a line out the door on weekends!! It is a small little house so make sure you can wait to eat about 20-30 minutes on the weekends. 

I've tried several of the omelletes, the stuffed rasberry french toast, eggs benedict, and they are all fantastic. If you are a foodie and you want an \"upgrade\" from the usual country breakfast place or Ihop, then this is the place to go!! 

It's so gourmet and the atmosphere is quaint and busy. The servers are great and even get you a cup of coffee while you wait. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Not only do they have great breakfast but there turkey club and potato salad is the best I have found here"}
{"text":"Ordered the Mushrooms Gruyere Spinach omelet.  Very good,  and they don't skimp on the fillings.  Service was excellent. Coffee was excellent. Tasty red potato \"hash Browns.\"  Country atosphere is light and airy. 

The only negative I can think of is that for me,  it was difficult to get comfortable in their hard wooden chairs.  That aspect alone detracts somewhat from the experience. 

Advice: get some chair pads or build in some booths."}
{"text":"Found a groupon for toast cafe so we figured we would give it a try, it's located in a retirement community club house, the staff was nice enough and the prices are high for the quality of food, and for a place with toast as a name, they don't have butter just some soybean oil whipped up to look like butter, the syrup was very low quality and left an bad after taste, I couldn't choke it down, with a groupon we dropped approximately $40.00 for breakfast for three, we were completely disappointed..."}
{"text":"Brunch as amazing! We had the stuffed French toast and three eggs with hash browns. Both were so delicious. Service was great as well. We will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Everyone swears by this place. Unfortunately it's dirty. Mimosa came with some bubbling black item in the glass. Then my plate had black debris on it also so I decided not to eat. Then when my party ordered and I said I would pass the big ass waitress rolled her eyes and gave me an attitude as if I did something wrong. She needs some manners or a good old fashioned ass kicking. Either way they just lost 6 customers for good. No food is worth eating if on dirty dishes and no place is worth going if the staff is rude."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Been countless times for breakfast, lunch and take out. Wait staff is always friendly and help each other out. I pretty much stick to the California salad with the creamy raspberry dressing so I can't comment fully on the menu or quality of the rest of the food but the other folks I dine with have always been pleased with their meal."}
{"text":"How about this, a family owned cafe that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner? These folks are really hard workers.

I paired with them for a wine dinner with them a few weeks ago, which was a new thing for them.
They were super flexible to make the menu work with the order of the wines, the wait staff was excellently timed and the kitchen pumped out a full house of 30+ plates for 5 courses with nary a hitch.
The chef has some good ideas and a bit more practice will bring the finesse in the dishes up.  
PORTIONS were huge and need to be scaled back for other events, but this means on a regular night you will be well fed for a good price.  I think the tab on the wine dinner was $65 excluding tip and you got four courses plus dessert, quite a deal."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  Went this morning and food quality was not as good as it used to be.  Also, would not honor local flavor/Groupon."}
{"text":"Wait staff was extremely slow. Could not remember to bring anything out that we asked for; extra ice, toppings for food, etc. Server was also never around to ask for stuff. The kitchen was so slow they ended up not even getting two of our meals out and we ended up telling them we no longer wanted the food. Food that came out was sub par. The vegetables of the day that come with every meal were over cooked. Everything here seems to be a complete mess and needs some kind of a revamp."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday and were disappointed. My husband ordered the baked cod and, while tasty, it was by far the smallest piece of fish he has ever received.  The sweet potato fries were ok -- not crispy.  Chicken tender portion size was good, but the taste was average. 

All in all a bit pricey and definitely not worth the money. We will not be returning to this cafe. Had high hopes and were disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to go have breakfast at red line grill. And was shocked to see it was shut down. I asked the people that were taking stuff out of the place what had happened. They said it went out of business. Then I was told that they had opened another place called toast cafe . So I headed there. It's much smaller I was expecting the same level of quality on the food and was disappointed. Don't know what happened it was not what I expected.. too bad I will probably not be coming back.."}
{"text":"The place to come for breakfast, no doubt. You will definitely experience a wait and a line out the door on weekends. I have had most anything on their breakfast menu and you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"We had a group lunch at Toast today & all 15 of us were very pleased with our food & ultra friendly server, Orlando!  My Cobb Salad was delicious & they even mixed the salad & dressing for me without a second thought when I asked.  The burgers & sandwiches were large, the sides were nice size servings, & our beverages were all kept filled.  Hopefully they will have meal specials, but they have only been opened 4 days.  Give them a try!!"}
{"text":"Hate to give this place a bad review, but. .. service was not good, he said they were understaffed so perhaps not his fault. The food was not great. A few of the ingredients on my salad had turned. My husbands tuna melt tasted old as well. Not sure if it was just an off day, but I don't think we will be back. :("}
{"text":"First time at Toast Cafe and we will be back. Good fresh food and good service. The owner even stopped by and chatted with us for a couple minutes. Great breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Home sweet home! This is one of those old school spots where everyone knows each other, they each have their own spots, and they love to talk about the weather.  

We chose a seat next to the window because it was too cold to sit in one of their many outdoor tables.  We were approached by a nice young waitress who promptly took our order.  We ordered french toast and a western omelet with a bowl of fresh fruit.  Our order was delivered in a timely manner and our drinks were replenished often, considering, my mom drinks like horse this is always crucial. 

The food was delicious!  It was the best french toast I have had in a long time.  My mom found it \"different,\" but enjoyed the fact that it had a homestyle flavor, which brought back memories of her mom's cooking. The omelet was fluffy, light and the fillings of cheese, ham, and peppers were very generous.  My mom constantly orders an omelet and she even found this one to be exceptional.  Her only complaint, that it wasn't hot enough throughout, was quickly remedied by the server. In spite of this small glitch, the omelet was awesome.  Further, the bowl of fruit was solid, it had a good mix, was very fresh, and it was included with the omelet.  This simply does not happen in San Diego! 

EAT UP!"}
{"text":"Ordered open face turkey sandwich with a baked potato.  Fried the turkey slices so they were crusty and inedible.  No baked potato even though it was on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had breakfast & dinner.  Their breakfasts have very adequate portions.  Last night we had their fish fry.  It had the best batter we have had in the Surprise/SCW area.  The Staff is very friendly.  Family operated."}
{"text":"I have been twice now.  They have incredible coffee!  The meet lovers omelette is stuffed with great quality sausage bacon and ham.  The portions are bigger than your normal restaurant inside an old folks community.  They normally run short handed but both waitresses I've had hustle hard and make the service above average.  Overall in Surprise the price is average for breakfast.  I'll be coming back and would recommend it."}
{"text":"We had two omletes, teo sides of bacon and coffee.  $42. Yeah, that isnt happening again ever.  A child could make an omlete so a good omlete is one that is cooked.  Nothing specual there.  I shouldnt have looked at the bill.   Any satisfaction left at that point."}
{"text":"The food was very good and I would definitely come back again the manager is very nice and looking forward to many meals at this place.  Everything that came to the table was great.."}
{"text":"The menu was not terrific for the prices. I was not terribly impressed with the sandwiches here. The bread was so thick you could hardly put your mouth around it. My friend ordered the omelet and it was made from powdered eggs, she was not impressed either. The server was very nice and they have a lovely location."}
{"text":"I love coming to grab breakfast here, the food is always delicious and the service is always great. I usually will order their eggs benedict or crabcake egg benedict. Every now and then I'll venture off and do a french toast combo or something. Whatever the case may be the food is never a let down :)"}
{"text":"Toast would be a regular destination for us but for the terrible, weak coffee.  We are not coffee snobs, but we do like coffee that can stand up to some cream.  Thinking that the hot chocolate might be better, I switched to it during one visit but was sadly disappointed.  It was also watery and weak.  Their food, however, redeems them significantly.  Their omelets are quite good, and they always have unique specials for breakfast, so don't forget to check the board before ordering.  While the Davidson location is larger, we prefer the Huntersville location.  Parking is also easier at Huntersville.  Service at Toast is fast, efficient, and friendly.  They will even offer you a free cup of their coffee while you wait, a nice touch.  Even if the wait appears long, you will be pleased to see how quickly they move tables.  If it weren't for the bad coffee, we would go to Toast much more often."}
{"text":"Super-duper yummy breakfast!

The berry crepes are phenomenal and the bacon outstanding.  (My friends informed me that it would be the best bacon ever, and I admit, it's pretty darn good!)

One friend religiously (like, every Sunday after church) orders the peanut butter and banana stuffed french toast.  Seriously deadly good.  Fortunately, she's a marathoner and can work it off!

Highly recommended breakfast/lunch stop in a busy, homey environment.  Great selection on the menu.  Looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"Toast Café is a slightly hidden restaurant located in the center of Huntersville.  I have been to Toast numerous times for breakfast so it is only fitting that I review them on my most recent visit for what else, breakfast.

Atmosphere- It must have been restaurant in old house day for me, as that is Toast.  When you arrive, go inside to the cash register area to decide where to sit.  You have the option to sit inside or outside.  If it is a nice warm day, I recommend inside if you are allergic to bees.  Seating is a little cramped but this place is about tasty food and not comfort.  On Saturday and Sunday mornings, this place is a mad house, w/ lines and all.  

Food - To start they bring you corn bread and this cold applesauce  spread that I think is great to just eat on its' own.  Overall, the food is delicious, especially the French toast w/ powdered sugar and stuffed w/ what I believe to be Maine blueberries.  I get this dish all the time and love it!  It is a little pricey at $7.95, but it does come with two strips of bacon or two sausage patties.  While I have been here several times I always get the same thing, I know...I need to broaden my selection to do a better review.

Service - Service is good and while the wait staff mostly consists of teenagers, they are very attentive and try to deliver a pleasing experience to the customer.  As an example, I overheard one couple coming in from outside to avoid the bees and their small child was sung to by their server to help avoid the child from being upset w/ the situation.  That is good customer service.

Overall - I like Toast, crowds and all.  I will have to broaden my selections as I am sure they have even better dishes that I am missing out on.  Dang those Maine Blueberries!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

A decent, non-fried, no ketchup required breakfast joint in Charlotte?  This is quite yelp-worthy.

Toast is a little cafe that knows how to do brunch...tucked away in \"downtown\" huntersville.  It's one of those small town downtowns that features a courthouse, a farmer's market, a whole lot of pickup trucks with nascar bumper stickers and this little gem.

I've been here several times on trips to visit my brother.  My favorite dishes include any of the omelets and the pumpkin pancakes.  Be sure to look for the daily specials board since it doubles the amount of menu selections.  I have always eaten on the patio, but there is also seating available in the main house.  

Service is fantastic.  My coffee cup and water glass never go empty... and all of the various bus boys are VERY friendly, especially if you are blonde.

Expect a bit of a wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great service chicken salad wrap. And pancakes are good."}
{"text":"Toast is neither great nor horrible.  3 stars is the best I can do but I do admit my rating is closer to 4 than to 2.  Mainly for the fact that, at least its not a chain restaurant.  The quality of the food has been generally good, same with the service.  But the food does not hit the realm of REALLY good.  To truly excel, a start would be a better cup of coffee than I can get at IHOP.  There are way better breakfasts to be had out there, sadly, probably not in Huntersville.  This part of NC overall, including Charlotte, seems to have a dearth of non-chain breakfast/lunch places.  At least Toast makes an effort to fill this void. I will admit that my last visit was close to a year ago.  Will give it another whirl and see if I can bump it up a star or even two.  Believe me I WANT to!"}
{"text":"George and his staff are wonderful. Small, intimate place to eat. Big portions. Delicious food. 

George, the owner, actually sat with us for a while and talked to us. 

People need to remember that this restaurant is in a retirement location. Things are a little slower here and that is to be expected and appreciated. Because what they lack in speed, they make up for in service and food quality for the price.

Will be coming back here again and to his other restaurant as well.

Thank you guys and keep up the good work."}
