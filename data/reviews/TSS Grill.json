{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food is great, and their prices can't be beat. They offer a mixure of filipino and Italian food."}
{"text":"The place is secluded so it's hard for people to notice. It's located inside Aruba Hotel in downtown LV. Their food  is awesome though!  trust me, their sisig is way better than Cafe Moda's. Their Kare Kare is good too. I didn't see any cabbage or unnecessary ingredients in it. Their breakfast plates are served all day and they are good and affordable as well. They also serve Italian, Mexican, and American foods. They have Mahalo Fridays which is a Hawaiian theme but with awesome new dance music. All in all this place is not bad."}
{"text":"quite frankly this place is really NOT that good... This place doesnt represent the great quality of filipino food! where in the world do u see bell pepper nd cabbage in Kare-Kare ... but i guess if you are that hungry its okay :))"}
{"text":"a friend of mine took us to this place where he swing dances...learned the basics with him and had a blast! the atmosphere was chill and comfortable. lots of room to dance. the bar is huge. but the food...awesome! i requested adobo fries and was given a confused look back...but the kitchen cook worked his magic and was able to throw some delicious pork adobo on top of some fries...and it was the best!! love this place and can't wait to go back!!  

debi-deb :p"}
{"text":"This place was an amazing hole in the wall find! I went on a Thursday night and they had a muscial jazz band playing. Along with the hot off the pot dishes, the \"family feel\" service, and the decent prices you pay for such a large amount of food, you really can't go wrong! Also this place is run by a Filipino couple, so if you have your parents, grandparents, aunts or uncles to bring, this place is the place they will sure to enjoy! Can't wait to go back! 

Food tip: Try their sisig and sinigang! The best!"}
