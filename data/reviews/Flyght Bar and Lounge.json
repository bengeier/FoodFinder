{"text":"Flight bar is he best bar in entire Urbana champaign county in my opinion. Flyght bar mainly plays hip hop music and when it's a good night for Flyght Bar, meaning lots of dancing people =), it's the most fun. Flyght bar sometimes is really dead on weekends that I feel like they should a lot more partiers. Sometimes the music is a little outdated for me since I'm younger but the DJ normally is really nice and will let you suggest a song. Overall o love flyght bar. Ohh and one other thing THEY DONT SALE FOOD !! I think they did way back but they don't now."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere... Definitely a upscale lounge for the City of Champaign-Urbana!!!"}
{"text":"An excellent alternative to the student-overrun nightlife options in the C-U area. Always good music, service, and beverages. Sections and bottles are reasonably priced. Frequently brings in quality entertainers to add some spice to Central IL."}
