{"text":"My favourite poutine.  Gravy, cheese, and fries ratio spot on.  Gravy temperature hot enough to melt the cheese despite being outside in below 0 weather.  Fries nice and crispy with enough structure to hold their form even in gravy.  The aroma was unexpected but heartwarming."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best hot dog I have eaten and the spicy Italian sausage was fantastic. The Italian sausage had a great snap to it and they toast the bun."}
{"text":"This is one of the ubiquitous chip trucks parked in front of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.  Always the truck closest to John St. is a good thing, because i don't have to walk past the other lower quality trucks.  I'm not sure if it recently changed ownership, of just changed cooking staff.  There is a nice Husband and Wife (at least they act like they are married). They used to cook at a truck down the street.  The only down side to the new cooking staff was there is no one trying to take your women.  The last cook would flirt with your girl and ask \"What are you doing with an ugly guy like that?\"  Entertainment while you wait in the longest (and deserved) line of all the trucks.  What I don't miss is the old guy grabbing the fries with his hands (yes the same hands he uses for your money).  on to the FOOD:  Fries: fresh cut fries cooked in fairly fresh oil. Large portions. Highly recommended.  Gravy: Dark and tasty not overly salty.  Just right. Only $.50 extra for all sizes of fries. He pours it on so its an extra good value if you order large fries. Also Highly Recommended.  Poutine: Same fries and gravy but topped with cheese.  Lately they have been using grated cheese (and orange cheddar at that).  They had originally had curds, but have switched.  Small cheese portion does not warrant the extra cost of the upgrade.  Burger: Flame grilled, cooked to order. It takes a while to cook, but is quite good.  Its most likely a frozen patty, but it's about as good as you can get from a fry truck.  Polish Sausage:  flame grilled like the sausage, but taking less time, the sausage is large and tasty.  My usual order.  Combo:  Hot Dog, Sausage, Burger combo's are available.  Its really just a Hot Dog, Sausage or Burger with fries.  It's $.50 cheaper than buying a separate small fry, but you get a few fewer fries than you would have with a small fry container.  No drink included in the combo."}
{"text":"Don Juan's is little more than one of those small food trucks known in Canada as a \"chip wagon\" or cabanes Ã  patates, literally meaning  \"potato shack,\" with generator running and food offering signs plaster about it operating on Front Street near the  Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Basically its offerings are little more than greasy but tasty enough street foods the likes of Polish sausages, hot dogs, burgers and fries, though seemingly as an overlooked token gesture of healthy eating, a veggie hot dog.   However it does specialize in one the more truly Canadian, albeit Quebec in origin, food offerings called Poutine. If, like most Americans, you are not acquainted with Poutine, it is traditionally a serving of French fries and cheese curd topped with a brown gravy sauce. Though I didn't order this particular dish at Don Juan's, what I saw them serving up as Poutine substituted true curd for a grated cheese that to me tasted as being that of a sharp cheddar.   The staff of Don Juan's are friendly, quick witted and full of humor. I know that having learned I was from Florida, when my order was ready they called it out as being \"pick up ready for the Gatorlander.\"  LOL!"}
