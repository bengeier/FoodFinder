{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fried food but once a while you have to sin right? Recommended by a friend,  I gave this place a try and wasn't disappointed at all! 

I ordered the broasted chicken which comes with lots of fries and two small garlic dip cups. The portion was more than enough for two people. We overate but didn't regret the choice just because the taste hit the right spot. Chicken is tender, tasty and you can feel the juices are locked in bcs it's done broasted method. The best part is its crispy flavourful skin. Mmmmm, I wish they can sell fried chicken skin there as an appetizer. I'd probably order a few haha. Also, they never have the chicken ready and sitting under those heat lamps. It's always fried once they take your order. Can't get any fresher than that eh?

 Staff is nice, friendly and helpful with your questions. The overall look of the place is relaxing, contemporary and clean. I'll try their oven baked chicken next time. Looks good too. 

The only negative I could find was the price. For $20 plus tax, one whole chicken with fries and garlic dip sauce, I found it to be just a tad pricey and specially when chicken is their main and most selling product, it has to be a little, juuust a little less expensive. If u add some drinks, we're looking at close to $30 with tax and tips. Hmmm. I think I have to check the prices at KFC to give it a fair price review. Last time I went there was I think in 2002 lol. 

Oh and a tip: Consume the chicken over there on the spot. It'll be extremely hot bcs it just came out of the pressure cooker so just have to practice patience or cut them open to cool them down faster. If u bring it home, the skin (the highlight) might get soggy and most likely you won't enjoy the crunchy experience.

{"text":"One of the best fried chicken in town, fresh, very big portions. The chicken is very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The round fries is as good as it could be, crispy and delicious. The stuff are very welcoming, very accommodating and serve you with a smile. I highly recommend this place you wont regret it."}
