{"text":"Went in for lunch the other day - ended up chatting with the cook for the day - pretty damn good food - had empanadas, good seasoning to the meat filling and pastry on the outside nice any flaky - cuban sandwich was good - cook ended up letting us try the gazpacho - that was great - nice flavor and really fresh - wouldn't think twice about heading back to this place."}
{"text":"Super awesome food and incredibly friendly service! I've never had any other Cuban or Cuban-American food to compare this place to, but regardless... good food is good food.

My boyfriend, roommate, and I stopped by this place on a whim because the restaurant we were originally trying to eat at was closed at the time. It turned out to be great last minute decision.

The food is fresh--farm to table style, so the menu is always changing which is a nice change of pace. As a vegetarian, I was pleased with their tofu dish at that time (I honestly forget the name of it though). The cook/owner at that time chatted with us for awhile what the whole deal is with the place and even gave us a sample of a new dessert he was whipping up. He was extremely friendly and inviting, as was the bartender/waiter.

We had gone back one other time which was equally as good as the first time. We keep meaning to go back again, but due to busy schedules and what not, we haven't had a chance. I haven't forgotten about Salud's though and will return for sure."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Cuban-American restaurant/bar on Butler Street, doesn't look like much from the outside. That said:

Excellent food, relaxing atmosphere, personable staff. Best meal I've had in awhile, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"2 enthusiastic thumbs up!  My cousin and I went here on the recommendation of some friends.  I had my doubts going in since the other Cuban restaurant in the 'burgh doesn't actually have a Cuban chef.  But the food at Salud is just like the delicious eats you find on Calle 8 in Miami.  (the lechon, salmon and congris were so good we ordered additional entrees to go) The owner/chef is from Cuba/Miami and was very welcoming and passionate about his craft.  the co-owner was also very attentive.  There weren't a lot of customers in there at the time, but i can see this place becoming a popular spot.
only tiny complaint is that i couldn't get tostones... only platanos maduros (the sweet kind).  But that's not their fault.  It's hard to get green plantains and other tropical fruit outside of Florida."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've not ordered anything that wasn't delicious. Some of the drinks are hit or miss, but overall, great menu and service."}
{"text":"Talk about alienating a certain segment of the population. I visited my cousin in Pittsburgh and she thought it might be cool to go Cuban (our heritage) so she looked up this place. We took one look at the menu and walked out. Naming something a Che burger is like going to a Jewish deli and having a Hitler/Himmler sandwich. I don't care how good the food may be, it's ignorant. Of course, maybe they don't want anyone who had to flee Cuba (or their relatives) in there. I hope the Bacardi Bros. don't sell their fine products there. And yes, I joined Yelp just so I could point that out. I only wish I knew someone who could muster up a crowd to picket this joint. At least we have plenty of Facebook friends in the area."}
{"text":"Loved my first meal of Salud!   Will definitely be back.  Delicious rice and beans and plantains.  They include those 3 sides with the meal and the coffee is delicious.   I ordered the pork belly wraps and was happy with them, but thought it was maybe a little skimpy on the portion size.  The owner and his staff were very accommodating for my toddler son, which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"This is Cuban food.  Enjoyed everything about this place.  The food was the best, the chef was warm and interesting, and the decor was mysterious.  Got the empanadas, cuban sandwich, plantanos and yucca.  Didn't try the entrees..."}
{"text":"I really like the sandwiches and fries.  The pulled pork is mouth-wateringly delicious, as is the Cuban meatball.  The owner is super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"I have visited Salud a few times since they opened and love it. I've never had a bad experience here.

Salud is a good place to go if you are looking for a quite place to have a few drinks, but after smelling what they have cooking in the kitchen, you will definitely be asking for a food menu. Beer and cocktails are all reasonably priced and the food menu has some great dishes on it.

The menu changes often depending on what is in season and what they can get at the market. I think the menu was different every time I've gone in to eat. Prices are a little higher than expected, but the food is absolutely worth it. The quality of the ingredients really help make each dish spectacular. There is nothing on the menu that is disappointing.

The (small) staff is very friendly and happy to accommodate. My wife and I have a habit of going in when they are about to start closing, but we've never been turned away. No matter how bad and guilty we felt for staying, they basically insist on it. The owner/manager is a quirky older guy who is pretty passionate about the place. He wants everybody to enjoy their stay and leave with no regrets. The cook, who you can sometimes catch behind the bar, is very laid back and friendly.

The eating area is pretty large and I would say it would be good for larger groups, but with the small kitchen and small staff, I would assume you'd be waiting around a bit for your orders.

The layout and atmosphere are very relaxing. They do have a few chairs and a table outside on the sidewalk, but it's right along busy Butler St. I think most people use it just to take a smoke break before going back inside to sit.

The hours are a little odd compared to other places along Butler St. They tend to close early on weekdays (like, 9pm early) and are also usually closed Sunday and Monday.

Overall, this place is great. It really sticks out amongst the other places in Lawrenceville. I recommend Salud to anybody looking for a different kind of bar/restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went this evening for dinner. While I think this place could lose the wood paneling, the food was great. We had empanadas, the steak and the Lechon sandwich. All pretty good in my opinion. The mojtio was on the sweeter side (which the waiter told us about) and also was quite solid. We will definitely go back and bring friends. 

The waiter was extremely friendly and the cook came out and said hi to us as well. I would tell people to give it a ago."}
{"text":"YUM! Finally good Cuban food in the Burgh. Between 2 people, we split the empanada platter, the congrie, lechon and fried plantains and everything was fresh and tasted just like home made food. Good service also. Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of the food."}
{"text":"This hole in wall was yummy! Some of the best Cuban food in Da burgh. The food was fresh and authentic. Cute bar too! Worth checking out for dinner..."}
{"text":"I went to this place prior to an Artist Party last night! It was delicious! The bartender was very nice and accommodating. I ordered the jerk chicken with rice and beans.  It was spiced just right. I will definitely go back. I gave it 5 stars because I actually cleaned my plate."}
{"text":"If you are expecting a wonderfully authentic Cuban meal, you will be sorely disappointed. 

DECOR:  This is a former dive bar, and it still looks like a dive bar.  It's poorly lit, with aging tables.  Looks more like a seedy bar you would see in the beginning of Scarface, when they are still trying to rise to the top.  

SERVICE:  We ordered a Jerk Chicken and another chicken dish.  Since you could see into the kitchen, we observed they had one person preparing the meals.  Our food too about 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  We were the only guests in the place when we ordered.  

The bar staff was very friendly.  

FOOD:  Meh.  My jerk chicken portion was large, but very dry.  Instead of marinating the chicken breast, they merely poured a very sweet, but not very flavorful sauce over it.  There was no heat to it.  The same could be said of my guest's meal.  Very dry and not very flavorful.  

I also had rice and beans.  They were cooked properly, but again, did not have the flavor profile you would expect from a Latin-themed restaurant.  Very bland.  

Most of the options are beef or pork, which is to be expected from a Latin restaurant.  If you do not eat red meat, or are vegetarian, your options will be limited.  

PRICES:  For the portions you receive, they are fair.  The quality of food, however, made us feel they were overpriced.  

OVERALL:  Great theme, but the mediocre food and depressing decor will likely lead me to not return.  Disappointed, because I had high expectations from the other reviews."}
{"text":"I came here for a Spanish Meetup event. First I must say that the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. It might have been because the restaurant only recently opened up (but I'm not certain). Regardless, this staff was probably the most friendly and pleasant I have ever encountered and it doesn't sit well with me, although fair is fair, to give only three stars.

I ordered the chicken with beans and rice with maduro as an extra accompaniment. While my chicken along with the sauce it was in (I forget what it was) was really tasty as was the maduro, I did not care much for the beans and rice, which to me is the staple of this cuisine. Do take into account I moved here from NJ where there are plenty of Cuban and other Latino restaurants that know how to make delicious beans and rice.

This place however has the perfect ingredients: a great location, a nice and roomy venue, and extremely nice staff. All they must do is perfect the beans and rice. The beans dish I really like usually has cilantro, sazon, and garlic and they are really soft. If they can improve in this area then they will easily get 5 stars."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and was looking for somewhere to eat dinner on a Friday night with a big group of friends. We hoped (correctly) that Salud could fit us in. They rearranged seating for a table of 14, gladly split checks, and even offered to let people order on a rolling basis as they arrived. The server (owner?) could not have been more accommodating. 

The mojitos were delicious and our party ordered most of the items on the menu. The empanadas would make a great large bar snack if you came in to do some drinking. I had the picadillo beef- the hamburger was deliciously seasoned, the rice got compliments all around, and I devoured the plantains. At $12, it was a deal for a large dinner portion. My date had the watermelon gazpacho and my taste of that was also yummy. 

The atmosphere looks like a dive bar. So what? The service was great, the food was fast and good and affordable, and I look forward to going back. I almost hate to give this place a good review- I don't want it to get packed like the rest of Lawrenceville! But I think this place deserves more attention for its good food. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT!  Having been to Cuba, this is confirmed.  Ambiance sucks.  I'd give that a 2.  Go for the good and enjoy it for that along with some good beers."}
{"text":"GREAT local place! Food was delicious! I had made reservations for early Saturday evening. It was our first trip there and I was VERY impressed that our table was ready with ice water on it for us! GREAT service and great food. 3 of the 4 of us had the Lechon and  I had the soup and the empanadas. Everyone enjoyed it and we look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place was great. The only other Cuban food I've ever had was when my wife made Cuban sandwiches so I can't really compare to much. I did try both their Cuban sandwiches, meatball and regular, loved them both. Fries were outstanding too. Sat outside on a really nice day to eat, service was great and I was given a free Cuban coffee which was out of this world too."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fairly authentic food preparations. Understated. Anything but pretentious. Casual décor. The focus here is on the food prep. Creative drinks and one of the best interpretations on a pina colada I've had - with pineapple ice cubes, delicious, not too sweet like those beach versions you might have had. Jami had a rum drink with cantaloupe ice cubes that was fantastic. Lechon was the best I have ever had, and made an ever better breakfast the next morning. Rice and beans were perfect. I didn't want the fried plaintains to end. Lettuce wraps with pork belly, avocado and mango was ridiculously good and fresh. Eat here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped today by chance. Being raised in Puerto Rico I was immediately drawn towards the \"rellenos de papa\". They were amazing. Nicely done, warm, recently made. The rice and beans reminded me of home. I am definitely going there again."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a Cuban place in Lawrenceville! I stopped in last week to order to-go and have a glass of wine while I waited. There were three other 2-top tables, a guy working the bar and the tables, as well as one cook in the kitchen. I ordered Empanadas appetizer, Cuban Sandwich, the Lechon Entree and Black Bean soup. I will say the Empanda is the tastiest I've ever had with a flakey, buttery crust...and that is saying a lot. The Cuban sandwich is by far one of the best in The Burgh, and the Lechon...mouth, dribble, watering. My only critiques...it took 45 minutes for my order, with three 2-tops, an already prepared meat (lechon) and a basic sandwich, seemed like a very long wait. Some better expediting in the kitchen would do wonders, as well as working on multiple orders at once. Also, I'd like to see an updated menu posted somewhere, anywhere, with the right perspective (check out their FB page). I would've given 5 stars, save for the very long wait. All in all though, I will order from there again and will continue to give props, 'cause the food is a slammin'."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday evening. There were two other parties and one bartender/server so service was very slow. We ordered empanadas, jerk chicken and a Cuban salad.  The empanadas and salad were okay but the jerk chicken platter was kind of lacking.  One thing I was really looking forward to were the plantains but they were small, dry and bland.  A colleague recommended me to this place because of the Cuban sandwiches.  Maybe I should have tried one of those because I wasn't really pleased with my main dish. The food reminded me of what you can order at Bahama Breeze in Robinson but Bahama Breeze's food and service are much better."}
{"text":"Man, this place is really got some potential!  Still a work in progress but the service was friendly and the food was Delicious!  We had the Cantaloupe soup and two sandwiches.  Prices are reasonable and food was fresh and hot and did I mention delicious?  

Can't wait to go back to try more.

Menu rotates weekly!"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty great - I had the Arroz con Pollo and really liked it. I'd probably come back but man do they need to do something about the vibe in this place. Cuban food, but no Cuban music playing. Actually there was no music - it was quiet as a graveyard except for 'Jeopardy' playing on the TV. Then 'American Idol' came on, and the waiter turned the volume up so it became hard to have a conversation. I mean..... come on. Great dinner but they need to work on the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lord Yeezus, this place was amazing. Their meat dishes are gangsta Cuban in ya face. I don't think the rice is Cuban though, but hey deliciously delicious deliciousness. Empanadas are everything everyone says they are. Flaky, delicious, in ya face. Highly recommend. I did take out, just as good. :D"}
{"text":"Great food and service, we have been here twice. Once just my wife and I. The second with our 3 kids( aged 15-12 and 6. They loved it as well. Nice to have options then the typical fare offered in Da Burgh..."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Saturday night with three friends. I think it may have been their first day (or one of their first days) serving a full dinner menu, so perhaps things will get better. I certainly hope so, as I love Cuban food and this is the first Cuban restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh, as I only moved here a few months ago.

My friends and I had a empanada platter appetizer for $6. Based on the amount of food you get, $6 is a great deal. If you want to eat four small calzones as a meal, then this could easily be a meal for one person. We all liked the empanadas, so we were hopeful about the quality of the entrees.

However, I found the entrees to be quite lackluster. I ordered the lechon platter ($11), which is a dish of pulled pork. It was rather plain tasting, and came with a side dish of white rice and black beans. The beans were ok, but the rice was rather crunchy and didn't have the same very light taste of garlic and oil that I'm used to at Cuban restaurants.

Another friend's fricase de pollo was so-so, with a side of plantains that were quite starchy and flavorless--not like the lightly sweet plantains I've had at Latin restaurants in other cities.

All in all, I felt that this restaurant did not live up to the standards of other Cuban restaurants I've been to in other American cities."}
{"text":"We loved Saluda!! Allison got the Cuban Chicken and we all wanted it. Service great! Authentic and delicious. We will be back for sure. They even put on our fav Cuban music group, Buena Vista Social Club."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the atmosphere is very relaxed. New favorite spot, will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"Strictly rating the quality of the food, I would give this place 4 stars. It's got pretty decent cuban fare.

However, my first experience dining here was very unpleasant because we received unprofessional service.  Everything started out fairly normal, but our food took 25+ minutes to come out after we put in our order, and there were only two other couples so it definitely was not because they were too busy.  When our food finally came out, the first thing the bartender did was lift the bread up on both of our dishes with his bare hands so that he could see which dish was whose.  If that weren't unprofessional enough, I was served a Cuban sandwich despite having ordered the meatball sandwich, and when I politely asked, \"is this the meatball sandwich?\" the bartender grabbed the plate from me, said \"let me see\", and proceeded to touch my sandwich all over AGAIN with his bare hands.  Then he told me that it was indeed the meatball sandwich and that their meatballs just don't look like normal meatballs.  When I pointed out that the sandwich had ham, he said \"No, that's not ham, that's cheese\".  Finally, I asked him to double-check with the kitchen, who then confirmed that it was a Cuban sandwich, not the meatball sandwich.  They did make my meatball sandwich eventually -- and served it to me after another 20-minute wait.

I'm not trying to be nitpicky about the details of this experience, but it was wholly unprofessional.  The bartender got visibly aggravated that I rightfully pointed out that they had gotten my order wrong, and basically tried to TRICK ME into thinking they had brought what I ordered -- by telling me that the ham was cheese!  Not to mention that he touched my sandwich multiple times with his bare hands, which I think is completely unacceptable.

It's too bad, because I think the food itself was halfway decent, though after the terrible service experience it was, frankly, hard to enjoy it.  I will not be back while the service remains as it is."}
{"text":"Prior to this past Friday night, I stopped into this establishment -- one that was formerly the rough-n-tumble dive bar known as Salac's -- on several occasions only to be told that they were cash only and weren't serving food yet. Not being a drinker, I have no reason to enter a bar unless a meal and/or live music can be had or heard. Roughly 32 hours ago, payday to be exact, I decided to attempt dinner at Salud one last flamin' time, telling myself as I walked briskly on a brusquely cold late afternoon that I would give up on the joint if I was informed yet again that no menu was ready. 

Thankfully for my sanity, and my grumbling tummy, a menu board was visible on the sidewalk in front of Salud as I approached it. Furthermore, credit card insignias could be seen on the window. My persistence would pay handsome dividends. 

As I entered the darkened, sparsely-populated bar portion of Salud, I was greeted by a tattooed mixologist in jet-black attire. 

\"I came to eat,\" I explained in terms that were not uncertain.

\"Sure thing, man,\" He replied as he directed me to the table of my choice.  A friendly middle-aged fellow in a shirt and tie who resembled a human resources manager more than a restauranteur would eagerly and graciously take down my order. 

Not particularly caring about the college basketball game that the two patrons in the bar were fixated on, I opted to sit in the homey, faux wood-paneled dining room in the back which stood in stark contrast to the bar with its bright, white walls. In regards to the decor, Salac's is still very much with Salud, but that's where the building's ornery, onerous past ends. 

Order the Lechon sandwich, and you'll temporarily imagine yourself standing on a street corner in downtown Miami or Havana munching on nothing more or less than some of the most resonantly rich, ramshackle, mojo-anointed pulled pork to ever be placed between the fold of a lardy, lusty submarine bun and cooked in a panino press. A grilled cheese with no grilled cheese, I savored it with a helping of fluffy, delicate, and mysteriously seasoned french fries. 

Also had was an appetizer of fried, timidly sweet plaintain chunks that simply needed more salt to perk them up. 

After finishing my dinner, I ordered a Cuban sandwich to take home to Kay (they had no desserts for service that evening despite listing them on their bill of fare) that somehow managed to stay warm all the way home in the face of a bus ride, a trolley ride, and chilly weather. Surprisingly, our microwave ended up with a night off.

And my, my, my, were the aromas enough to arouse the taste buds of my fellow passengers as many eyes zoomed in on drowsy and satiated me. Just as I flicked the pinhead stud on my (brand new!) iPod Shuffle and began to take in the majestic title track of Kreator's latest masterpiece Phantom Antichrist, I faintly heard someone call to me. I pressed the sliver and black, postage-stamp sized device's minus sign to lower the volume.

\"Young man, what you're carrying smells scrumptious, positively so. What is it that you have in that container?\" Bound for the Cultural District, a fur coat-garbed woman with Ralph Nader's gumption and Jessica Tandy's looks and voice had her curiosity piqued.

\"Oh, it's a Cuban sandwich for my girlfriend,\" I told her. 

\"Just what is a Cuban sandwich?\" Her innocence was endearing and precious as I explained the exotic delicacy to her.

From there, my newfound elderly acquaintance did all the talking.  Boroughs, parking, taxes, firefighters, and anecdotes of Pittsburgh that started with the words \"years ago\" occupied the remainder of my 20 minute trip. The German thrash metal would have to wait.

P.S. After finishing and complimenting my server (the owner?) on my overall experience as well as explaining my story (he thought I looked familiar), I was introduced to Salud's chef who, as fate and an increasingly shrinking world would have it, happens to know the owner of my neighborhood's own Casa Rasta. The subject of Yucca chips (Salud were out of them at the moment) prompted the conversation. Celebrate diversity. Give Salud a shot."}
{"text":"Driving through Larryville, the giant sign with the Spanish word 'Salud', followed by 'Cuban Cuisine' caught my eye. I hadn't noticed it before, and with good reason, since it's a fairly new restaurant.  Now, speaking a little Spanish, the word 'Salud' can mean two different things. When raising a glass to a friend, one would say 'Salud' as in, 'To your health'. It can also mean just...health. So I wondered if this was some type of odd Cuban health food establishment, or just the vernacular use of the word. I was quite relieved to find it was NOT 'health' food, but genuine Cuban food.

I lived in Puerto Rico and Miami, which left me surrounded by Cuban eateries, so I was very curious to try this one out, and I must say, I was not disappointed in the least. Well, there WAS the issue of not having Cuban coffee...

The atmosphere kind of left something to be desired. And in my book, that's not usually such a bad thing. Big Jim's In The Run and Nied's Hotel come to mind. Both dives...both serving up great simple food. And I don't go out to eat 'atmosphere'.

Salud offers a short menu of authentic Cuban cuisine. Two things the Cubans seriously know how to do is roast pork and bake chicken. The kings of pork, really. We opted to both have the Lechon, with is a mojo marinated and roasted pulled pork, served with your choice of side, ranging from Congrie (con-GREE-ay) which is a fusion of rice and beans, to separated sides of rice and beans, red or black, fried yuca or plantains (yuca are really like french fries, and plantain like savory bananas).

The Lechon was absolutely delicious. Brimming with flavor, and perfectly paired with the congrie in my case. My friend has just the rice and red beans, and I sampled that as well, and it was just as tasty, though not as complex.

The only two disappointing factors were that it was 5:30 on a Friday, and for a half hour, we were the only customers. We sat at a table near the bar, and the back half of the restaurant was extremely dark. It wasn't until another couple came in that they turned on the lights nearer the back and we realized they has more of a 'dining room' area in the back which was much brighter. The food was terrific, and the bartender/host was extremely kind and friendly.

Second was the lack of Cuban coffee, which was on the menu. They said that the chef had 'lost' three pots since opening, and couldn't find another one. I make Cuban coffee, known as the 'colada' at home using my simple espresso machine, and it tastes exactly like what they served me in Miami. I can't understand why they couldn't find an espresso machine. Hit a community sale kids! You can grab five of them for $5 each! Since Pittsburghers seem to feel it's the BEST thing to give as a wedding or shower gift...and that Pittsburghers generally have NO use for.

When the second couple came in, the bartender plugged a few Latin tunes into the jukebox, and with the lights now on, the place was a little more alive.

They deserve to be much more alive. This is very good food. Authentic. Tasty. 

If I could only convince them to add Fo Fo (known in Puerto Rico as Mofongo) which is a plantain base, topped with the pulled pork...or shrimp. Mmmmmmm.

Put down the Primanti and give it a try! 

The prices are reasonable, they have a full bar, and the location is very doable.

Salud!"}
{"text":"Salud was the first place my friends and I stopped at after arriving in Pittsburgh. The food was great. I started with the tomato and avocado salad and it was very refreshing. The lechon sandwich was good but the Cuban was better. My friend was generous enough to break me off a piece of his chicken from the arroz con pollo and it was well prepared. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. There was a Spanish song playing on the speakers that was enjoyable. The song was on repeat and played around 10 times while dining. It seemed like time was slowed down or a residual flashback was occurring."}
{"text":"So this place isn't fancy. Just barebones... Probably used to be a bar, used to be a restaurant etc. But don't let the plain aesthetic scare you, there's good food to be had!

Not surprisingly, I had to go with the Cuban Sandwich, which is ham, brisket, cheese toasted on Cuban bread. It was very good. Their brisket is pretty legit alone. The fries looked to be freshly cut. But, they could have been crispier. Same with the plantains I stole off my friends plate. But they were still tasty as well.

Also, I will note they serve freshly brewed sun tea. I love a good iced tea, so this was a treat! But beware, you only get two refills of the tea! I'd for sure come back and try some of the main dishes."}
{"text":"Salud was our welcoming meal upon arrival in Pittsburg, PA (not to be mistaken with  the Burg in the Bay Area). As we entered, the man behind the bar, formally known as the Bartender, took our order, served us, everything. It was a caucasian establishment, not tapped at the source, if you will. I had the Cuban sandwich and am not mad at all, it was on point. The lechon sandwich was almost just as good. Little to my knowledge, the same song played on repeat the entire time we were there. I guess all the years in Spanish clubs have made me oblivious to it. It all sounds the same anyways."}
{"text":"You'll feel like you're eating in a Havana Bistro with a Cuba Libre on the side and expect a hand rolled cuban cigar to follow your meal under palm trees.  

Which leaves one massive mystery: I've never seen a cuban cooking, serving, waiting the bar, or eating there.  I'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by Saluds door.  Yet, magically, it tastes like everything was teleported over from Fidel Castro's personal chef right to your Pittsburgh plate.

Incredibly fresh dishes, high on flavor and quality.  The service was genuine and warm, and the bartender even offered us holiday cookies his wife made as a desert for free just to be friendly.  

The atmosphere is totally standard Lawrenceville/Pittsburgh bar, and has no hint of the cuban deliciousness that is conjured up in their kitchen.  They have a solid craft brew list with a large number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable prices across the board.

I'd love to see the atmosphere match the excellent cuban food and strong service, but I'd gladly come back either way.  For great cuban food at great prices, Salud, I salute you!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out. m. I was so excited to eat their \"famous\" lechon sandwich.  I waited patiently, then when I get home to look into what I ordered, my lechon sandwich was all soggy.  Like what the hell....it just infuriates me.  Bottom of the tray was a pool of water.  Sure I expect a degree of wetness for having it packed to go, but not like an inch of water in the tray. The French fries were soggy placed with the pickle.  What the hell.  why couldn't you separate the fries from the pickle  Soggy Salud - the first and last time I will eat there."}
{"text":"Please try Salud - you will NOT regret it.  Run by two hipsters who also double as band-mates, this isn't \"authentic\" Cuban (rather Cuban-American) but the food is fresh, tasty, and the service is top-notch.  If you tried Salud when it first opened, it was run by different staff and I encourage you to give it another chance with the new management.

@Curtis G and I live right by Salud, and have been meaning to stop in here for months.  We finally made the time, and we were glad we did.  Surprisingly, we were the only diners at around 9 pm on a Saturday.  Our server did mention that Fridays are usually their busier night.

Salud is Farm to Table - meaning the menu changes frequently based on what local fare is available.  They post their menu updates on their Facebook page (they don't have a website).  The menu offers fewer options that other places, however, I don't think that's a negative as I love that the food is fresh and local.

I'm a terrible Yelper b/c I really can't remember the name of my dish, all I know is that all the ingredients were flavorful, and the argument for more Farm to Table restaurants is evident when you are enjoying mango that's bursting with flavor because it's so fresh.  The chef came out to check on our entrees, always a classy touch and showcases the passion of the staff.

Our adults beverages were amazing, individually-made and with all fresh ingredients.  I'm picky about my mojitos, and have been known to send them back if they aren't to my liking.  Salud's mojito was cool with the perfect amount of fresh mint.  It's def in my top mojitos in the city list (new Yelp list idea?).

And if you like ghost stories and anything with a macabre history....this is another added bonus for you to try Salud.  I won't ruin it for you.  I encourage you to ask the bartender about the history of the the previous tenant (Salac's - a bar where dirty cops used to cook the books, allegedly!)."}
{"text":"Great Cuban Sandwich and friendly service. Will return to try dinner sometime soon."}
