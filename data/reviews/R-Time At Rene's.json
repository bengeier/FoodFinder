{"text":"wow could not even eat the entire sandwich of  the fish. Mac and cheese for the kids and chicken parm sandwich for the wife.. will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food good price, they offer a two for $20 deal with a appetizer and two meals which can't be beat"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the bartenders' recommendation which was baked haddock, and it was delicious! I loved every bite of it. Highly recommend it if you're into fish. I love that they have a somewhat full bar too, great cocktail drinks. I enjoyed my time here. The service was quick and friendly and the food was fresh. I'd come back here if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"We have not been here for probably 15 years. The large fish sandwich was just as great as I remember. We ordered the 2 for $20 special. We had a very big and good chef's salad. Then we had large shrimps (8) and fries. Then we ate part of large fish sandwich and we are taking the rest home. Since we had left  some room we had two pizzolis stuffed with hazelnut chocolate moose. Very enjoyable meal!"}

{"text":"Aug 8th 

Enjoyed a nice quite dinner, alone in the dining room. 

The pasta was excellent. We have never tried the pizza before. I highly recommend !  The fish is good as always, but the bun was a bit off. I do suggest ask for the fish without the bun. 

It is a nice family owned restaurant a little out of the way, but worth the trip !"}
{"text":"Great little local restaurant, most of the food is pretty good but what stands out is their fish sandwich it's outta this world, it's huge and there's enough for two/three meals depending on how hungry u are, the chicken parm isn't bad either :)"}
{"text":"Consistently a great meal and great service at lunch time.  Really enjoy the gnocchi and wedding soup."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and had very nice dinner experiences.   Recently I  returned for dinner with a guest. 
     I was happy to experience the same fast, friendly service, great food, very generous portions and fair prices.    
     This place is consistently good.  The restrooms are clean and the staff are helpful and accommodating.   Rene's deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten in and had take out numerous times and I am always very happy!  Recently I brought my friend, who had never eaten here before.  She, of course, had heard many times over the years about the fantastic fish sandwich.  She opted to get the large fish sandwich and take leftovers home to her son.  She was very impressed with the huge fish sandwich and felt it lived up to its reputation!  She ordered a side salad that she enjoyed, so she took her coleslaw home with her extra fish,  I did taste her slaw(the creamy kind) and I really liked it.

My daughter and I each had soup and shared the Carnivore Calzone. We loved the calzone, were satisfied, and still had leftovers!  My friend sampled it as well and liked it so much she ordered a different variety to take home to her son!!  He will eat for days on those doggie bags!!

Of course the three of us had to try dessert - we opted for the carrot cake.  OMG sooo yummy and ridiculously enormous!!  It appeared we had barely tried it and luckily the remainder made it to my take home bag.

I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is a solid three star hole in the wall restaurant with bar.  They recently updated the place, however they still have the red light bulbs around the back of the bar.  This place is especially famous for their fish sandwiches.  If you get the \"regular\" fish sandwich as opposed to the mini, it could feed easily 3 people, maybe more.  The mini is huge enough on its own.  The prices here are reasonable, and the place is very clean.  I definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Italian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area! The food is always fresh, flavorful, and very consistent. My favorites are the fried cheese and gnocchi, but their calzones/pizza, and sandwiches are great as well. I always look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Great food!

Came for a birthday party. I would just say that the service needs to be a little better for how many people were at the event. They just had one guy doing drink orders. They could have had a couple more waitstaff available.

Other than that everything from the drinks to the food were amazing! Had the Malibu breeze drink, chicken parmesan, and wedding soup. All were fantastic. 

Definitely make your way to this gem soon!"}
{"text":"The folks who were running this place were all nice, so I hesitate to give such a low rating, but the baked haddock I had was simply bad--almost certainly fish from a frozen package, and with very little in the way of seasoning applied, so it was basically a not-so-fresh fish over rice and mashed potatoes.Their eggplant dish was less than ideal, too. On the plus side, the fried zucchini is actually pretty good, and their dessert, while not thawed correctly (a bit of it was still frozen-ish), was solid. But mostly the options available are quite bland and uninteresting."}
