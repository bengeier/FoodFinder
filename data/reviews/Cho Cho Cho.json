{"text":"Order time on Just-eat: 2:35pm Delivery time: 4:18pm
Food is obviously cold. Had to call to find out where the food was, as the delivery time on just-eat.ca said 3:35pm, they are only 10 minutes from my home and I was starving. They said they were busy. No apology, just said the delivery guy will be there soon. As I am about to reheat the food I ordered nearly two hours ago, I strongly recommend you avoid this place. Save yourself the hunger pains, and order from WESTOWN CHINESE. Great food, great service, huge portions, EARLY delivery."}
{"text":"Been eating here for a good... 3-4 years now and I can say I never been disappointed! The sweet and sour taste is consistent and their chicken balls are great! An even rate between batter:chicken. 

Just tried to order form them today and they were punctual, will do business again!"}
{"text":"worst chinese food ever!!! nothing but vegetables what a rip off. Noodles have no taste looks like ramen with vegetables, chicken dishes are nothing but vegetables the rice was nothing but soysauce i would give it a 0 star rating if i could"}
{"text":"my friends and I ordered $100 worth of delivery, 8 dishes total. All four of us agreed it was some of the worst tasting chinese we have ever had. Cheap, but very low quality."}
{"text":"I ordered from Cho Cho Cho for delivery. The delivery not only took long (3hours) I called several times inquiring about my order and received responses like \"we're very busy, your order is next\" \" we don't know which delivery guy took your order out\" \"your order left a long time ago it should be there\" I not only waited 3 hours for my food it came cold and I was not satisfied due to the lack of customer service I was shown. The food tasted good but the whole experience from Cho Cho Cho was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Deciding to eat at Cho Cho Cho was mostly because it was the closest chinese place to my house. And I had read online that they had orange chicken so honestly, I'll try orange chicken anywhere. 

The staff was very friendly. I wasn't expecting it honestly. I'm not sure why. But it took me off guard how nice they were. I ordered take out. Orange chicken and fried rice. If you order it right there, you can watch them make it. The kitchen is all open. Its basically all that place is. Its a kitchen with a counter to order at and some benches to sit and wait. 

When I got home with the food I was pleasantly surprised. The fried rice was delicious. And while the chicken wasn't really orange chicken...I think it was actually lemon chicken it was still pretty good. The only thing I found a bit annoying is that there were far more vegetables in my chicken dish then actual meat. A little disappointing. 

I will more than likely try this place again. I'd probably go for something else on the menu though. Their appetizers look pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Chili chicken is always good and never disappoints. Late Night fare, this is the sauce I wear."}
{"text":"Definitely more \"fast food\" scale Chinese food, so don't expect anything fancy. For the price, you get a ton of food. It is usually ready for pick-up in under 15 minutes which is great. And the guys who work there are so sweet and friendly!"}
{"text":"Though I've given them 2 stars, they're really not that bad. The place looks slummy inside and out, but the food is OK. I ordered from them for the very first time yesterday and the best thing on the \"General Tao Chicken Combo\" (a cost of $6.00) was the fresh and properly cooked broccoli. They gave me chicken fried rice and there was a noticeable amounts of chicken. The General Tao Chicken were small pieces of breaded chicken and it was fine. The sauce was different from what I'm used to, but still tangy and had a small bite to it in the way of spiciness. They added an egg roll, but sadly it was over cooked and lacking filling. The people there were very friendly and accommodating and kept the place reasonably clean. They do deliver and I hear its fast, but they do not take debit at the doors like many restaurants do these days.Only cash or credit cards. I will make an order for delivery from them and add more info in the near future."}
{"text":"Our order took just shy of 2 hours to arrive, even though this restaurant is a 10 minute drive away. Called 3 times to be met with poor customer service. Food arrived and i was made feel as if it were my fault that it took so long. Needless to say, the food was tepid at best and didn't have much flavor to it. Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Decently priced food and generally the deliveries order on time... That said, all the food here takes pretty mediocre. I've ordered from here over a dozen times and in terms of flavor, this has to be one of the worst Chinese restaurants around. It's on par with mall food court food. Again, considering the price, delivery speed and service, mediocre food is good enough."}
{"text":"Kids loved the Fried Rice. Fought over it. 
Szechuan Beef was good, not outstanding, not too spicy.
Honey Garlic Wings - Moist and tasty.
Will order again."}
{"text":"The WORST General Tso Chicken I have ever had. Chow Mein noodles were SO salty... like ramen noodles. UGH. So disappointed."}
{"text":"We order from here often.  The staff is always great.  Delivery is alway timely.  The food is always hot and delicious.  I would recommend Cho Cho Cho to everyone.  My family loves this place.

Great take out Chinese food!"}
{"text":"When you're craving cheap Chinese food and want delivery for less, Cho Cho Cho is the place to call. They offer free delivery for $14 which is awesome, and the food arrives hot. 

However, the food is where Cho Cho Cho loses the stars. My experiences have been hit and miss at this place. The appetizers I've ordered (Crispy Wontons and Chicken Balls) have been good, but the entrees I've had (Singapore Rice Noodle and Beef Flat Noodles) have been misses. 

The convenience of the delivery is what will bring me back to this place. Hopefully, I come across an entree dish I love."}
{"text":"I live walking distance to Cho Cho Cho, so I can't say anything with regards to delivery... but these guys are my go to for hefty portions of yummy chinese. 

When my boyfriend and I want the perfect amount of food, no leftovers, we order the dinner for ONE.  I have the appetizer (Won Ton Soup... as good as it gets!!!), we split the \"main\" (chicken balls) and he has the fried rice.  Always enough for both of us.  If we have work the next day, and are too lazy to pack lunches, we get an order for 2.... reheats beautifully. 

The store is obviously hole-in-the-wall and shabby... but I'm not eating there... and there kitchen is actually quite clean when you look closely.  

General Tso Chicken is quite good here.  As are the chicken balls."}
{"text":"Cho Cho Cho, you are great at what you do - Westernized \"Chinese\" delivery.  

However, they do have some authentic off-menu items that you can ask them to make which are very tasty.  

I have always had consistent delivery service which is friendly, fast, and tasty.  The portions are great for the money (I ALWAYS have leftovers), the food arrives hot, the delivery and phone people are very polite and friendly, and it has real flavor versus being overly saturated with soy sauce, grease, or msg. 

What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery during a snowstorm and so I knew it would take longer than the 45 min listed on the website.  The restaurant is only 3km from my house, so I didn't think it could possibly take that long.  Two hours later, I called.  The guy said \"it is on its way\" and hung up on me.  I called back and asked what he meant by \"on its way\".  He told that I was \"bothering him\" and that he was \"too busy to deal with me\" (according to the timer on my phone we had only been speaking for 20 seconds at this point) and hung up on me again.  When the food arrived it was cold and mediocre.  The only other time I have ordered from this restaurant in the past, they screwed up my order.  Never again."}
{"text":"This used to be a Ho-Lee Chow location. So the menu is still basically the same and prices in the same ballpark. That's really all you need to know.

The same guys are always there; service is fast, and the food is consistent. 

The lunch specials are the best deal at $6."}
{"text":"Hey, remember when Ho-Lee Chow went bankrupt? It was all over the news when it happened. People wondered what would happen to the franchisees. 

They can stop wondering. It seems like many of the locations are still in business under different names, peddling Chinese-Canadian classics without the support of a single head office. 

Cho Cho Cho would appear to be one of these outlets. On the south side of St. Clair, Cho-cubed anchors a multicultural strip between Jamaican, Latin and Italian neighbourhoods, which suits the cuisine very well. It's the kind of non-ethnic \"Chinese\" food that grad students write theses about these days. In the middle of clearly defined ethnic neighbourhoods, Triple Cho presents a classic Canadianized take on Chinese classics, so the food is unrecognizable to true Sinophiles. However it suits when you're looking for something deep-fried and sweet. 

3 Cho Night has a sit-down restaurant which sits empty most nights in favour of a thriving takeout business. Their website features a photo shopped Ho-Lee Chow menu, right down to the playful descriptions attaches to house specialities. I wonder if the present owner operated as a franchisee before; and if so, whether the menu is a violation of intellectual property law. 

Takeout arrives fast and for the most part, hot. Appetizers trump mains, which are often inconsistent. Egg rolls and spring rolls arrive hot and crispy, with bright vegetables and well-seasoned meat. Hot and sour soup is both, and loaded with chicken, tofu and other veg. Wontons are tasty, but the soup is horribly salty. Pork potstickers are past their peak, but satisfy a late-night dumpling craving. 

As mentioned, mains are hit and miss. Portions are huge, but the food itself isn't always top-grade. Chicken balls are battered heavily. I avoid the gooey sweet and sour sauce. Sauces are generally indistinguishable from each other. Szechuan and Kung Pao come with a tonne of vegetables, but register more peanut butter than heat. General Tso chicken is a gross (and I mean gross) disappointment. Chicken is petrified beyond chewing. It's sauce seems like little more than Sweet and Sour with a few chili flakes and less food coloring. It sits on a bed of unsalted steamed broccoli, which is properly cooked but does little on the plate other than turning the General's batter into mush. Better to go with the Cantonese chow mein, which offers a bright mix of vegetables and an orgy of meat/seafood on top of lightly crisped noodles. BBQ pork fried rice is enough food for an army. Other than starchy peas, it elicits no complaints. 

Forest Hill is not known for it's Chinese restaurants. Cho Cho Cho operates at a level well below China House (which also delivers), but for a safe, inexpensive late-night feed, I would ride this train."}
{"text":"Cho Cho Cho is my favorite Chinese delivery in Toronto. The food is delicious, the delivery is fast, and the prices are unbeatable! You can get a full meal delivered to your door for less than $18. That's something you don't see everyday.

I always order the dinner for one combo which includes your choice of 1 appetizer, 1 entree, and one rice for $13.79. Delivery is free if the total comes to $14.00 before taxes, so I always add an egg roll or two, to get the free delivery.

The food is pretty good. The wonton soup is a must.  I always try a different entree, and I can safely say I haven't had a bad dish yet. They've all been delicious. The portions are very generous, and one dinner for one combo can easily feed two people.

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what Cho Cho Cho looks like on the inside. It could be tacky, dirty, gaudy or glorious. Don't care. They deliver cheap goods to my couch (formerly my very grown up air mattress covered in an Ikea blanket) in a timely manner on the cheap. 

Their hot and sour soup is decent. Their fried rice among the best I've ever had delivered, tres well soya sauced with large hunks of BBQ pork, real slabs, not cubes.

If you're in the north-west of the downtown core you should definitely Cha Cha Cha to your phone phone phone for some Cho Cho Cho."}
{"text":"I'm sad that this place has closed. Been visiting Cho Cho Cho for twenty years. They made the best orange chicken and hot and sour soup. Anyone know why they close and were can I get Orange Chicken now?"}
