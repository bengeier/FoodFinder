{"text":"Love their food and varieties of margaritas!  Best ever!!  Prices are kinda high though. More happy hour prices would be my suggestions."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food. Excellent menu choices. Friendly service. Home town atmosphere. Our server was Ken, was attentive and friendly, offered several menu recommendations. Was our first time eating here. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My good friends recommended La Ristra 
This past weekend so we jump in the car and head over there and boy I am glad we did the food margaritas , service and atmosphere was an awesome experience take it from me who is known in my circle for really knowing good food this restaurant was a homerun and I cannot wait to take my wife next weekend."}
{"text":"Bradley is thee best server ever. Always there when I needed something. Brought out my food in a great time. It was very amazing. He was quick and very friendly. Ask for Bradley if you ever go here!!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just moved from downtown Chicago so it has been difficult to me to find good food in the valley. This place is great, unique home cooked recipes. Well at least they seem like good old family recipes! Margaritas are decent and they have large servings of food and drinks!
Will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I  wanted to check out the recently opened  La ristra, as it is in my area.   
Decor was nice,  but they need to learn how to keep it  clean.   Dirty table and cloudy glasses are a real turn off.

Margarita my wife ordered was fairly tasty, but very weak on the tequila, and it was way overpriced.    Service just ok.   Waited much too  long  for our food, and when it finally arrived,  the order was wrong.    Waitress told me I was in the wrong,  so I just ate what she gave me ( shredded beef burro plate).   The burro plate was pretty good to be fair.   The black bean tostada that  my wife ordered, was cold, and just ok.    Waitress later returned to apoligized, admitting she did get it wrong.    Burro plate ended  up  on the house, but  I dont think it was enough to put this place on the regular rotation.   Time heals all and  I could see myself giving the place another shot, if it is still open in a couple of months."}
{"text":"Food was great. Green chilly burrito plate is awesome. The waitress was not very friendly. Other than that everything else was great."}
{"text":"While in Gilbert my friends and I had dinner at La Ristra.  The food was delicious and the service was wonderful, Ken,  our sever for the evening was a delight.  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone or anyone that is looking to have a Mexican style dinner and be happy with the choice.  I certainly will  go back. for seconds and thirds."}
{"text":"Very delicious !!  I had the relleno and it was very tasty.  Very new, nice place to try"}
{"text":"Finally decided to check this place out. Service was amazing. My Margarita was a little on the strong side but I won't complain because it was so delicious. I order enchiladas with egg on top. Omg so amazing. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I am a true New Mexican food snob and I do like this La Ristra.  I love the Blue Corn Enchiladas with green chile sauce.  For me the hotter, the better.  The Adovada Ribs are excellent.  For those familiar with Los Dos Molinos, there is a family relationship between the restaurants.  Sometimes the service is the bar is not the best, but the food is always good."}
{"text":"I found the restaurant from a friends FB post.  Checked it out on 6/29 and was back 6/30.  The ambiance is fantastic!  It has a very cozy and welcoming feel to it.  Only had margaritas on my first visit but they are fantastic as are the complimentary chips and three salsas!  Not too warm for me but if you sweat with mild salsa, then you better watch out :)
I went back the next day for lunch.  The red and green chilli plate I had was delicious and spicy!  There is a whole lot more to try there and I plan on it!
The bar is a thing of beauty!  They have quite a selection of tequilas and it looks like a work of art.  
The staff was fantastic and very friendly!  I can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"We have searched for a great Mexican good restaurant for several years. Finally, we found one. The food was excellent.  The service was surprisingly good. The wait staff was very attentive and we even had a visit from the owner. She was appreciative of our business and wanted to make sure our dining experience was one which would encourage us to return. This restaurant us a WINNER!"}
{"text":"I had the Pork Green Chile plate.  It was basically soup with a few (and I mean few) chunks of pork.  Flavor was fair at best compared to other New Mexican restaurants I have been.  I have to agree with another reviewer.  They cannot do rice and beans.  Now the goods.  I did like the flavor of their green chile salsa.  My wife and mother did say the margarita flight was very good.  My suggestion would be to come for the drinks and only order food once you are tipsy enough to not care how your food tastes."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Green Chili Stew recommended by staff was over done and with no chicken.  Egg rolls were flavorless.  Atmosphere is good, fast service."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place as it is right down the street. I am so glad we did! The food is not your typical Mexican food and they have a lot of choices. We split the blue corn enchiladas and a cheese crisp. All of the salsas are really good too! I had a skinny margarita which is sweeter than I usually like but overall he service and food was great and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great!! Queso, enchiladas, tacos, and chili relleno - all were great! I was not as impressed with the service. We kept having to ask for things, like plates for our appetizers. One of us had been there before and loved the sangria so we ordered a pitcher of sangria, she brought a pitcher of margarita sangria. We clarified if this was their standard, she kinda went back and forth on her answer and said they do also have plain sangria. We had asked what to say next time to clarify we want plain sangria, she said just say sangria (that's what we had asked for). She said sorry, that was the button in the computer, and that she could strain it out (not remake it), but this wasn't really an appealing option so we said no thank you. It was good, but not what we ordered and I think it was a bit rude to then charge us the much higher price for for the pitcher that was her mistake. Again, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best New Mexican food we have found in Arizona! Stuffed Sopas christmas style hit the spot. Very generous with the adovada filling."}
{"text":"They marinate their pork four days in there is unbelievable as it falls apart in your mouth. Their food is incredibly unique and great and their drinks are awesome as well. We have our own tequila shot glasses there that want to try every tequila you get a free bottle. Just don't try to try them all in one sitting. Haha.
It's a great place for Mexican food and we recommend it to everybody."}
{"text":"A little slice of home. Love the food and margaritas here. The owner is from Belen and he really hits up the menu variety. The stuffed sopas are awesome and I recently enjoyed the shrimp calabasitas enchiladas. Love the New Mexican flair and enjoyed the staff. Good food and good people just like New Mexico."}
{"text":"Our first time was great! We went on a Tuesday night, service was fast. Great menu selections, waiter was very helpful! We tried the blue corn enchiladas & adovada ribs. New Mexican style decor & food. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised on a hot, slow, holiday weekend. True \"New Mexican\" cuisine prepared in uncommon dishes with great service (Aaron's a star).

Chicken Casserole was amazing - perfectly prepared and seasoned. Get the Calabacitas veggies. Very good.
 
Their Margaritas seem a solid value and taste great. Very good Fried Ice Cream to finish up.

We'll be back, soon."}
{"text":"La Ristra is hands down my favorite New Mexican cuisine in the valley,I used to drive to Richardsons in Phoenix but now I can save the time and gas money to enjoy the amazing green chile sauce here at La Ristra! Brad is an amazing server who was very attentive and genuine. I'll be back like Arnold and if you give this place a try you will too"}
{"text":"So spicey, food was unedible.....I've lived in and eaten mexican/new mexican for 50 years.....unfortunately was delivered and didn't want to hassle with sending back....second experience with LaRista.....both no wow effect....."}
{"text":"Having lived in New Mexico while in the USAF, I grew to love the cuisine.  With La Ristra here in Gilbert, I can now get my Green Chili Fix whenever I need to... which is often.  The staff here are extremely friendly and will take the time to explain the menu and give their recommendations.   The Blue Corn Enchiladas are a must.  The portion sizes are generous and will most likely prompt the to - go box!  So glad my wife and I were recommended to try this awesome eatery"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and exceptional service from a server named Nick. My wife loved the chicken enchiladas with calabacitas and rice and I had the chicken chimichanga with rice and pinto beans. The salsa music set the tone for the awesome food that we enjoyed. We were pleasantly surprised with the tasty pitcher of Margaritas that was suggested buy our server. If you want to support a family business in Gilbert while being provided with a memorable evening with great food, LA Ristra must be on the list."}
{"text":"Went to eat here based on a friends recommendation.   Purchased a groupon and met everyone down there.   Ended up getting served by the owner who honored our groupon even though it was Saturday and the groupon clearly stated Monday through Thursday.  Enjoyed the meal and service.  Portions were big and salsas and guacamole were great.  Owner operated business with owners who care.  Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, highly recomend it. Exellent service provided by Joey , who recommend the calabasitas... delicious!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for lunch on Saturday and sat in the bar. We were greeted and seated immediately. The staff was friendly and explained their menu. 
We had the taco appetizer and watermelon margaritas. Both were served fast and had alot of flavor. 
I had the blue corn enchelada stack that was delicious and spicy. I will say that their sauces and meats were spicy but not over the top. Perfect for my taste.
My only complaint or knock on the place was $10 each for the drinks.
We plan on coming back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"We had a great experience celebrating my husband's birthday. Food was great and so was the service. Matthew was our waiter, very attentive and a wonderful personality for our group! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Not only was the food great, the service was great as well.  I tried a variety of things here: appetizers, soup, main course, drinks, and dessert.  Everything was amazing.  The atmosphere is awesome, it definitely has that unique bistro feel to it, nothing like a chain restaurant.  I am surprised by any negative feedback.  The owner personally greeted me and told me the story behind the restaurant.  He is the type of business owner who would bend over backwards to make his customers happy.  Go in and ask to meet him!  I highly recommend this place, especially during lunch or if you're looking for a nice night out on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place loads of times. I keep going back as well. I'm from New Mexico so I'm pretty picky with my \"Mexican\" food. But I love this place. Blue corn enchiladas are amazing! Carne Adovada burritos as well. Drinks are kinda expensive but are pretty strong pours, so it makes up for it. Really great selection of tequilas as well. All and all two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Our Friday night ritual margaritas and the best New Mexico smokey spicy Mexican food in town. My husband and I have been coming every Friday night rain or shine since the opening. When you ask my daughter what she wants for dinner she shouts La Ristra! Out of all the servers we have had Brad is the best! Hands down he has the best service. Great patio fresh food and this place never gets old. I big red heart this place."}
{"text":"Every other Mexican meal you've ever eaten just died of embarrassment. Nick is an amazing waiter."}
{"text":"Excellent food an service  will have to back to try stuffed sopapila. Our server Tommy was very helpful and seemed to love his job and the restaurant"}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food I have had in Arizona and the service is even better.  It took maybe 2 min for the food to come out which normally would leave me to believe that it was not freshly cooked, but luckily I was wrong.

My taco and chicken enchilada plate with Christmas sauce was bomb!  Only problem was that my boyfriend's chimichanga came out as a burrito...which was not a problem at all because unprompted the manager came over and asked to exchange it for the chimichanga ordered. Poof like magic maybe a minute later there it was!

La Ristra is a great dining experience backed by even better service and staffing.  This is a new house favorite and we will be returning many many times!"}
{"text":"La Ristra is exactly as the reviews and own website declares: Awesome New Mexican cuisine, which makes it unique and different from the regular Sonoran food we love in Arizona.  We were about 30 people large for a wedding celebration and had reserved the private room.  They prepared the room with 2 long tables for guests and one big table up front for the bride and groom with a nice welcome sign for the newlywed couple customized with \"Welcome Mr and Mrs. XXXX\".  It was unexpected and I found that to be a nice gesture.  Food was AMAZING and all the guests in our group said the same thing.  Recommend the Green Chile Plate!  Our servers Erica and Ivan were prompt, patient and courteus to our large group and did an awesome job!  I will be back here and would recommend to everyone who is thinking of coming here to try something different."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite New Mexico style restaurant.  I had the blue corn enchiladas, they where fantastic. My wife had the tell another and she really enjoyed it. The service was great, our server, Brittany, went way above and beyond. She made our experience memorable."}
{"text":"Very Clean, Ice Cold beer, had a table of 7 and everyone was impressed. Great service from Kelsie!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Good ambiance with splendid service! The nachos are made in the restaurant.  Three salsa sauces ranged from mild to spicy.  The entrees we chose were a one!"}
{"text":"Food amazing! Drinks amazing! Live music always good! The atmosphere is so fun, but not too much going on that it interrupts our dinner. Service can sometimes be slow, but we usually sit in the bar area which can always be less attentive than the normal restaurant area."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Mexico and when we first heard of this restaurant we were excited because we finally had good food from home!! Well yesterday I ordered the red pork pasole to go, this was my second time ordering a to go meal. The first time there was a sufficient amount of pasole and broth in the container the second time it was barely filled half way AND they forgot the sopa I ordered with meal. I called to notify them about the amount of pasole I was given and the fact they forgot the bread. Well the manager, whose name was Joe, told me that \"they over served me the first time I ordered a to go order and that they should have never given me that much to begin with\" then he offers to replace the bread next time I come in. This upset me because I paid almost  $15 dollars for a decent meal and to be given what was probably corners of the pot was ridiculous. I told him not to worry about it and that I wouldn't be returning. This is sad because we know the owners of the resturant and are fans of their other resturant in Mesa ,Los Dos Molinos. Overall poor poor customer service. It's a shame because the pasole there is the favorite dish."}
{"text":"Luckily we didn't give up on the Yelp map location, since it was about a mile off and just googled to get the correct location.  We had the Sunday bucket of Corona light special and got 2 servings of the red and green salsa which were nice and spicy.  Our six year old had the bean and corn salsa which wasn't spicy, but tasty.  Our food was out super fast and the Christmas adovada pork stuffed sopapilla, carne Adovada ribs, shredded beef farmers burrito ala carte, the New Mexican traditional burrito adovada green ala carte, and kids cheese crisp were all enjoyed and we all had plenty to eat.  We all agreed we would go back and as we were leaving we found out they are expanding into the space next door for more family dining space.  The decor was very cool and a few of us can't wait to try some of the tequila selections next time.  The service was very good as well and not to be left out of this review.  The bad news is we live in ahwatukee, but the good news is that La Rista is very close to Gilbert polar ice which we frequent at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Chili Relleno is spectacular-showcasing the hatch chili, rather than overshadowing with a heavy batter. Sopapillas a nice accompaniment. Great margaritas! Service was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service wasn't great. We had one person in our party (of 9) got their food when others were paying their bill. Another person didn't get their bill until she flagged down our server and asked for it, and when she did get the bill, she was charged for something she didn't order. 

The chips and salsa were great, the carne asada fajita burrito was really good and the server was attentive to my 2 kids. Perhaps it would of been a better experience with a smaller party."}
{"text":"Had my first taste at the Small Business Alliance meeting and was impressed with the sampling so I decided to do a lunch there today.  I had the pork abodada green chili wrap, now I love New Mexican food but this thing was amazing. They packed so much flavor into that wrap I could not believe I was still in Arizona"}
{"text":"It was ok food was kind of bland. I am trying to find an amazing Mexican restaurant; I have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Our first time here. Fabulous!! EVERY employee that passed our table had a smile and friendly words to say!  Sat on the patio and was not rushed to order or enjoy our night out.  My husband and I joined the \"agave club\".  That's saying a lot when it takes at least 3 times to find a \"favorite new place\".  My favorite Mexican food place ever. Chantelle was amazing at explaining and taking her time visiting with us!"}
{"text":"Best food ever especially the fajitas and non spicy salsa,good service... and really  frish  saled."}
{"text":"I ordered a Watermelon Rita and got a 14oz drink in a 16oz glass. Looked 3 quarters full so I asked about it... Manger came to explain how it was 14oz in 16oz glass... Really?  Please sell a full glass of alcohol?!?

The food was tasty and enjoyed the salsa that came with the chips. Each of the 3 of us enjoyed what we ordered.  Food was good..... Drinks?  Could be a top tier restaurant..."}
{"text":"Ordered one of the house specialties- carne Adovada ribs with a Dos Equis lager on tap. Our server was Ken - very friendly and attentive. He recommended the ribs and I was very pleased - glad I tried them - delicious. Clean, comfortable seating, nice decor. Nice place to sit back and enjoy an authentic New Mexican meal. Great place to bring friends. They also have over 100 tequilas and live music in the bar."}
{"text":"what a great place! It's comfy with excellent authentic food.  There's usually live music - the servers & owners welcome you like fam. Been here once or twice a month since they opened and it's always a good time.  

Try the 3 generations tacos, smothered burritos, Christmas chile - heck it's all phenomenal!

Whoa...  don't forget to get a Cadillac marg! 

You'll like this place!"}
{"text":"We first visited La Ristra a couple weeks ago when they were kind enough to donate a portion of that night's sales to the family of my 9-yr-old son's classmate who recently passed away.  A restaurant that supports their community already had my vote before we walked in. Besides, we'd never even seen the place from the street previously, as it's the cornerstone of a medical office-y type complex. 
The interior of the restaurant was beautiful- reds, deep woods..very classy and romantic. Although I'm not exactly sure what \"New Mexican\" means, everything was amazing. 
My son had a chicken quesadilla, filled to the brim and so good.  My husband ordered tacos, which he said were perfectly tasteful and unique. I had a shredded beef burrito and the thing that will bring us back is the fresh flavor of the beef. The sangria was also very flavorful- not too fruity, not too bland.
 I have recommended La Ristra to 8 people on 8 separate events since this visit.  Three friends have taken my advice and they loved it as well.  I really REALLY hope that this place is able to stay in business, since a lot of my new favorite places haven't done well in the past couple years.  Last thing I want to mention is that they have a full bar area separate from the restaurant, and outside seating. This would be an awesome Happy Hour joint.
PLEASE support this community-minded restaurant!"}
{"text":"As we live 1/4 mile away, we have tried to like this place. 1st visit for quick lunch left us 20 minutes speaking to nobody. Finally bartender came to take order. Food was good not great but 60 minutes for a quick lunch when the place was empty was odd. Second visit came at the exact time they were to open. Tried to open the door to but it was locked 2 min after opening time. We waited outside for 10 minutes until a staff member opened the the door only to continue holiday decorations. They could see outside the door and never once said welcome or anything. We were in the way. We left. Food is good and I see it is busy at nights but this will soon fade with this service."}
{"text":"I don't fall into this social media but I love this place so much that I started a Yelp just to review it and spread the word. You can't find any more authentic New Mexican food than La Ristra. The stuffed sopapillas, with ground beef, and green chile sauce is my favorite and is consistent every time I order it. The aduvoda pork ribs, however you pronounce that... had just the right kick to it and the meat was tender and falls off the bone. The portions are very generous, try the Nachos. They have great margaritas, good selection of drafts/beers. They have a nice bar area to watch the games, a lounge with couches, a large dining and party room area. The atmosphere is warm and alive, enjoyed the music which is a mixture of country, alternative, salsa (no pun intended) and they also have live bands on the weekends. The owners obviously know how to run a restaurant, the staff are friendly and very attentive, not like places that just want you in and out. My only complaint is the lighting was a little dim and I had trouble reading the menu but the waiters are more than informative. I am addicted to dining at La Ristra's and have made it a weekly routine."}
{"text":"We are from NM and have been trying to find real New Mexican food since we moved here.  We stumbled upon this restaurant today and were pleasantly surprised!  Real green and red chile, authentic NM cuisine.  If you're from the Land of Enchantment,  check out La Ristra!"}
{"text":"We were waited upon by the fabulous Tommy.

He suggested the cactus pear margarita, which was excellent.

He told me his favorite entree was the grilled chicken, and he added a side of enchilada sauce, Chris as style. It was wonderful!  Others in the group got the Carnitas, the Farmer's chimichanga, and the enchilada combination. The three year old rocked a crispy taco.  Everybody said their food was excellent (OK, the three year old just happily scarfed her food and then dove into her parents' dinners).

Highly recommended by a Washingtonian."}
{"text":"I am a fan of spicy food.., New mexican - Hatch spicy chile is my favorite: salsas are tasty, carne adovada is also one of the best.  My wife had steak and it was also tender and tasteful"}
{"text":"Great New Mexican restaurant! Nice atmosphere, great service, awesome food!
We will definitely be back here again- with friends and our family. Perhaps for one of their tequila events!"}
{"text":"Love this place only been there three times so far and the host remembered us I was surprised! Wait staff are great food is so awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, large portions, average prices. Staff went out of their way to accommodate us, and the
 service was very good."}
{"text":"This resturant needs to take a good look at its self,  for a newly opened resturant the walls were dirty, the glasses had water spots, we waited almost five minutes standing for someone to acknowledge us and one of the table must not had been level so they placed a piece of cardboard under the leg to level it. We should have left at that point but wanted to give this new local business a chance. The food took forever to come out, our waiter did keep us updated on its status and kept saying he was sorry it was taking so long and for the wait.  The food when it did arrive almost 50 minutes after we arrived and ordered was terrible.  The order came out wrong,  the red sauce was so hot I had to scrape it off so I could eat my burrito, the beans and rice had no taste at all.  We asked for the manager who advised us this was NEW MEXICAN style food and was suppose to be hot and spicy. He also advised they had a mild sauce they used on kids meals,  and offered to make us another burrito with that sauce. Now lets face it  I did eat my orginial order so why would I want another one?  We tried to explain that if the style of food was suppose to be that hot and spicy then they should let people know about the option of the \"kids sauce\"  but he didnt want ot hear it and keep saying it was New Mexcian Style cooking.   There was another group of people (8) sitting across from us  who sent their food back because it was too hot and one person from their group not only didnt finish his meal but it took to long he had to leave.
My recommendation is not to eat at this resturant unless you really like very spice no flavor food, have all day to wait for it, and spend alot for crappy food.
The one star is for the waiter who truely felt bad about the food and our experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at La Ristra. The food was good, probably not the best New Mexican food I have ever had, but the service was amazing. The server was training and still gave exceptional service. If you are looking for a new place to have dinner, this is great place to try."}
{"text":"A clean, relatively modern looking Mexican restaurant located in a strip-mall area.  The service was very good, particularly our waiter, Ken. All the food appeared fresh and well made. I had a 3 beef taco plate. The vegetables tasted fresh and the meat filling was quite tasty. Not very spicy, if you like hot foods. My wife had a chicken chiiichanga. The chicken as very tasty. The sauce was spicier then my dinner. The tortilla in the chimmigahnga was hot, but not crispy as it is often served.   My only complaint about the food is that the tortilla chips that were served at the beginning of the meal were all broken into very small pieces. Only the top layer was full-sized chips. The sauces provided ranged from a mild fresh, tomato salsa to a hot green sauce. We ordered a Margarita on the rocks. It was good sized, but I would say it was average in taste. Not bad, but noting special. The total cost of our meals, with drinks was less the $40 before the tip. Overall, I would recommend La Ristra for a good Mexican meal at a reasonable price if you are in the Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area."}
{"text":"We came here on my brother's recommendation. We loved it. Spicy and well made. Chips are just okay but the margaritas are excellent. I had green chili pork. Had to order flour tortillas on the side which I thought would come with it. Hubby had tacos and beef enchilada. Loved the red sauce. BFF had chimi. Yummo!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place. Pinto beans are a bit dry and burrito tortilla kinda hard. Maybe next time I'll order extra sauce to cover the burrito. Overall, great place, great flavor and good-size portions. Definitely will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, a place opened in Gilbert that has more than bar food! Have tried many items on the menu but keep going back to the traditional New Mexico burro Christmas style. Ivan has been our go to waiter from the start.  The bottom line is these guys know New Mexican cuisine. If looking for a new dining experience, give La Ristra a try."}
{"text":"After trying different things on the menu I would advise to only come here for their more specialty items (i.e. carne asada) vs more basic items since those tend to be super bland."}
{"text":"I've been in twice now, and have been pleased each time. Dishes made with real, scorching-hot New Mexico chilies for the daring, and Spanish-style tapas for those who prefer tamer fare. Come to think of it, they may be the only folks in town who combine the cuisines of Spain and New Mexico, and I like the result. Pretty much any carne adovada dish is worth a try. Finally, as a margarita connoisseur who's been known to send back a lame marg (especially those made with off-the-shelf premix), I can definitely rate the Enchanted margarita as top-notch!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and had a great time with the bartender/waiter Joe. Good service but it was only surpassed by the food. A good variety at our table. The fish taco special was very good, the Mac and queso as also very good. I had the pork adovado wrap with green chilies.  What a treat.  Will go back here without question the next time we are in the area.  Thanks Joe for a great lunch and a fun time"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh New Mexico food.  Try the adovado relleno.  The homemade salsas are excellent."}
{"text":"Get real. I can not believe this is a top Mexican restaurant in Gilbert. My shredded beef wrap was bland with no real seasoning, certainly not up to anything you would actually find in a good restaurant in New Mexico. I could not taste the Hatch chiles that were supposed to be in it. The side of rice had an usual flavor, somewhat like it was smoked but not really certain what the flavor was supposed to be. I left it. Service was pleasant and timely but it should have been given the place was less than 1/3 full at noon on a Friday (perhaps that should have been a clue....). Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I want to go here.  I have coupons in my two entertainment passbook.  But we tried to go there four or five times and it has ALWAYS been empty.  

I have a thing about being the only customer in a restaurant.  

I will be happy to go fill in the stars if somebody can tell me why this place is always empty?

Help me out Yelpers."}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant and in love with everything about it. The house made trio salsa was amazing. The tacos that we ordered from appetizer menu was delicious. Our server was very attentive . He made sure we were never left without drinks. We had fried bananas for dessert and they tasted as good as they looked. What made this restaurant the best was the band. They played all of our favorite songs and had everyone grooving!"}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food! Love the food, margaritas and service."}
{"text":"Two strikes!  We went several months ago to a Sunday morning champagne brunch and felt they were deliberately slow in coming around to avoid pouring more champagne. We went this time with long-time fans of Los Dos Molinos (same New Mexico family) who were sure they wouldn't like La Ristra as well.  They were favorably impressed!  They didn't like the chips and salsa, but loved their food.  My chimi had very good flavor, but was overly salty.  What ruined the meal this time was the extremely loud (pre-recorded) music.  We had a group of eight with a double table and communicating with the other end of the table was impossible.  If you know flamenco singing, you know that a piercing voice is part of the style and that, combined with the volume, made it painful for me.  Several in our group, ranging in age from 31 on up, commented on it.  I asked our server to turn it down (we were the only patrons in the room) and he agreed it was too loud, but it never changed.  It ruined a otherwise nice Sunday afternoon family dinner.  We'll try one more time, but that may have to be it for La Ristra."}
{"text":"All I have to say is YUM!!! Wonderful food, great drinks, and top notch service. It's a bit of a \"hole in the wall\" if you will.  Not a dive, just hard to find. Tucked away on a busy street surrounded by medical/business offices. Glad we found it. Wonderful food, nice atmosphere and great service. Can't wait to make an excuse to go back. It's a bit far from my local fair, but have leftovers!!! Either way, I am winning!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great place for a night with friends and family. Went to La Ristra recently with my kids and had a great experience. My food was delicious and unique. The kids were happy with their choices. Their favorite was the homemade Choco Taco! Great place to go in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"LOVE La Ristra!  Best New Mexican food in the area!  Perfectly hot & spicy. The Adovada sopapillas are to die for!"}
{"text":"After a long difficult day at work my husband suggested margaritas at La Rista. The drinks were very good but small for the price. Over 130 tequilas is impressive. Food was delish! Chicken enchilada & flauta with red sauce were very good. The green sauce is good but too spicy for me. 

Our server, Brad was friendly, attentive, helpful, courteous and made sure we were taken care of with quick drinks and hot food. Thanks Brad! 

Eating & drinks in the bar area is fun but gets loud when the live music starts. Small space with big sound is challenging on the ears."}
{"text":"When you give them your phone number to call you when your wait is up, they take advantage of it and send you unauthorized texts.  Very cheezy, otherwise I'd give them 4 stars for not being cookie cutter Mexican food.

Ok, so I have become a curmudgeon.  I do recall signing up for this now.  I apologize and appreciate you calling me out on it so kindly.  I truly love your restaurant.  I tell people who come to AZ that it is oddly hard to find good Mexican food, but you guys are the exception.

Oh, and if you are a local, I recommend you get your own tequila shot glass if they still offer that."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing! I recommend the chile Colorado if you like it a little spicy. Green chile  is not as hot as other New Mexican places around but the food is excellent. I like the atmosphere in the bar area and the margaritas for $5 on Mondays can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice prices, great wait staff. We will be back! The enchiladas are very good. Get the pork with Christmas sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is ok, the food is very bland.  I thought the chips & salsas were good.  We ordered cheese crisp which is good & guacamole (waiter recommended) there was no flavor to it... I had to doctor up the dip for us to eat it.  My main course I ordered red beef & green corn chili tamales which had no flavor, very bland. With side of rice & pinto beans. I liked the rice & beans were cold so I only had a couple of bites. I think this restaurant could be better if they just season their food. On a plus side waiter was nice."}
{"text":"I make it a point to always make a positive review after I leave a bad one.  I was leaving one for a service that let me down and I thought, \"Where have I been recently?\" and the first place that came to mind was La Ristra.  I have to say that I really enjoyed the whole experience.  Decent bar area with enough TV's to see whatever game or event that I want to.  Nice New Mexican cuisine and good service.  The pork is the specialty and it is awesome.  All in all a great experience and I will frequent!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today with a friend.   Was greeted immediately and sat in the bar area.  Julie and Joey were our servers and were great.  Food was exactly what we ordered and our drinks never went empty.  Great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed our meal! We sat outside on the patio and it was a beautiful evening. Joshua gave us excellent service and the meal was delicious! I had the Farmer's Burrito which was good and my husband had the Chile Relleño dinner which I am going to order next time :). We shared the margarita flight which was a fun way to try the different margaritas. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good tequila selection. However, a \"New Mexican\" grill that doesn't use New Mexico chile. I'm sorry but that's just not right. There is no comparison to authentic New Mexican food when authentic ingredients are used. I was born and raised near Hatch so I know. 

The food isn't bad. It's somewhat overpriced. The staff does seem to try to hurry you thru. 

Overall a little disappointing for me. Mostly because if the big claims yet being an expensive knock-off."}
{"text":"The service was unbelievable  here.  I usually don't talk  about this to much.  Tue male server was very knowledgeable  about the drinks and food.  This was enough to guarantee,  I'd be back.
Restaurants  ambiance is great for a Mexican restaurant.   Very new and clean looking. 
Almost, as an afterthought  we received our food.  It was very good.   Was told it was spicy.   Wish it  2as spicier.   Will definetly be back  to try other menu offering."}
{"text":"First time eating here today. I'm a NM native and tough on restaurants that say they are New Mexican. Great food here! Red and Green sauces and salsas are wonderful and actually pack a bit of a bite. Which can be hard to find! Great flavor and we'll definitely be back. Great ambiance too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. Green chile bean dip is fantastic, adovada pork ribs killer and carnitas tender and delicious. Happy hour every day 2-6. I highly recommend. Aaron excellent bartender"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional, especially the pork green chile stew and anything with pork adovada.  The flavors are rich and complex, and you'll never leave feeling like you could easily recreate it at home (I know, I've tried)!  The owners are active and involved with the staff, and it really shows.

P.S....we wish there were a few more options on the appetizer menu that could make a small meal.  The entrees are really huge, so some \"small plate\" options would be nice."}
{"text":"Deifintely not what I had expected after giving this place a 3rd try..... never was any better than the 1st or 2nd times..... burger was way over-cooked, green chili was weak, I have had better out of a jar from El Pinto that is True New Mexico Quality... supposed Fries were potato cubes fried and no flavor other than the oil they were sitting in on the plate...  3X times and still not any better..... hard to believe the Family is the same as the real New Mexico Los Dos Molinos... that at least is excellent real New Mexican food... I walked out the 2nd time with my wife and youngest child due to poor service as well...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. It was good, but nothing worth bragging about. The service was not that great. Food took awhile to get out to us."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. John and Andrea are great owners/hosts and the staff is great (thanks Brad and Ken) GOOD FOOD!  Adovada ribs and stuffed sopapillas rock!  You gotta try it!
We will make this a regular place to eat for sure! And don't forget the tequila selection."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  Drinks are great with lots of unique options.  I like the spicy mango margarita.  It's not super spicy.  The cilantro margarita is good, too.  Their enchiladas are delicious, and we have had great service here."}
{"text":"If you don't know where you're going you probably miss this place in
medical complex glad I found it excellent food very spicy the people are friendly and it's busy. 
Good drinks too"}
{"text":"The adovado pork should be considered an  aphrodisiac, ok maybe the awesome frozen margaritas help. The service from Joey, Julie and my son's favorite, Becka is great. The owners are very friendly and accomadating as well. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because I love New Mexico style Mexican food and it was a total flop. I ordered the Ristra relleno and the batter tasted like deep fried freezer burn. I have enjoyed New Mexico style Mexican food all my life and could never imagine I would ever dislike it anywhere. A horrible experience. I will not be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Eh. Had high hopes. Service was so awesome though. Very welcoming and personable. Maybe we just don't care for New Mexican food but nothing was to write home about. Carne asada was flavorless compared to my Hispanic in laws. Enchiladas were good. Of course since New Mexican food the green and red chili sauce was exceptional."}
{"text":"The trio of salsas were amazing. Our server Alex let us know the owners drive to get the hatch chiles from New Mexico. She was attentive and friendly, which made our experience terrific. The red beef enchiladas were very flavorful and the beef was cooked perfectly. The sopapillas were fantastic and plump. There are daily specials throughout the week. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened. That Carne adovada is so delicious.  Reminds me one of my favorite dishes from back home in New  Mexico.  My husband loves the Carne Adovada ribs. I really like we can also get a special green Chile order when it's green Chile season. This place is real deal."}
{"text":"We decidedly to try LaRista on a Friday night as it was in our neighborhood. Never been there before, but got there at around 6:15pm and the place was packed!  Didn't expect that because of the odd location (it's in a residential area next to a bunch of dental offices). We were seated about 15 min later, and it was well worth the wait. They brought out chips with a trio of fresh salsas that were delicious. Then we ordered the chilies relenios with beef. Mine came with black beans and a vegetable medley, my husband's came with rice and the same medley. Our meals tasted very homemade, like your granny was cooking the meal just for you!  It was amazing!  I will definitely be back to sample more from the menu!  Thank you LaRistra for cooking amazing, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Saw this place driving by and wanted to try it since I grew up in NM. After we were seated it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to come over. Ordered our food and a margarita which I had to remind the waitress of since another 15 minutes had gone by after that order and still no drink. After that we were starting to get a but frustrated. The margarita finally came and tasted like what I can only imagine a hair salon full of aqua net tastes like. We waited about another 10 minutes and our food came. My plate had the wrong kind of beans and was not very hot but did taste good. My wife's fajitas looked and sounded like they had stopped sizzling a while ago. Isn't that the whole point of fajitas? Coming out crackling and popping so we can be told not to touch the plate because it's hot? They also forgot the tortillas with them. when the waitress decided to make another appearance I mentioned the tortillas but by that time my wife was over it. So all in all not impressed at all.  Most of the time when I've had a bad experience at a restaurant it's not really the wait staffs fault. Usually it's food not cooked right or drink not made well. In this instance it was the pure lack of attentiveness by the waitress."}
{"text":"As 3 native New Mexicans we are very conscious of the true flavors of northern New Mexico cuisine and we must say that our high expectations were more than met here at La Ristra. Our server Aaron was friendly helpful and effecient. His recommendation of margaritas and the calabacitas were right on point. I can honestly say we WILL be back!  Nirvana for the New Mexican food addict!"}
{"text":"Becca was right on the money with drinks and food even being so busy they killed it. Made the trip worth coming up for. Waiting for band too start. 

So mucg food"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but felt i needed too today. I eat her almost once a week eating my way through the various delicious menu items. Today it was the Red Posole, WOW!! If your a true fan of authentic Posole you must give this one a try.

Great people, Great service and a comfortable atmosphere. If you haven't been here or if it's been awhile. I suggest you stop in."}
{"text":"We had a last minute party on Sunday night and they were amazing and accommodating. The food was great and our server was fantastic. Thank you Angel for taking such good care of our friends! We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Though the food that we did get was great, the food we didn't get? Well we don't know. We waited over a half hour for two out of 6 dinners to arrive. We were told it would be right out and then told that the chef walked out half way through. Bill was wrong in the end and we finally just gave up and paid. The food was good but the service was poor and we feel like we were lied to repeatedly.   The worst part was eating my dinner while my guest had no food."}
{"text":"Our new go-to for Mexican in the east valley. The stacked blue enchiladas are so delicious! I always get chicken and my husband loves the chili Colorado (it's too spicy for my taste). The salsa is great but the guacamole is really delicious. We recently went around early lunchtime on a Sunday so we were able to choose from the brunch menu. I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo. Very good! Loved the vegetables its served with & the potatoes were also excellent. We used to frequent another Mexican restaurant in town but since finding La Ristra we haven't been back."}
{"text":"We love this place for brunch! Cherisse was amazing and gave us so many suggestions to help keep people in our party in line with their diets! The amazing menu, $14 bottomless mimosas, Cherisse's helpfulness and smile will keep us coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally had the chance. It did not disappoint! The green chile was delicious!I had the carnitas and the margarita flight...and shared the fried ice cream. I will definitely be back and probably order the exact same thing because it was that good!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come in every week for a fish bowl and nachos. Out standing service usually from our regular server Chantelle. Love this place."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service, food and atmosphere. As soon as we sat down cold glasses of water, chips and three types of salsa was placed in front of us. We don't care for the heaviness of rice and beans so we ordered sides of vegetables instead. This was an excellent choice that I highly recommend.  The portions were large and the food fresh."}
{"text":"We went  for the first time tonight and we really enjoyed our dinner.the  green chili Is some of the best we've ever had, margaritas  were awesome love the fact that you have over 100 tequila choices, Service was great, food delivered fast and hot, couldn't ask for better experience. The owner John is super nice, and I join the Tequila Club, What a cool idea to have your own engraved shot glass waiting for you. We will be back next week"}
{"text":"Ben here several times
I really love spicy food of any ethnicity
Use ghost chili sauce at home
However I could not eat the farmers burrito it was so spicy
The waitress removed from the bill and offered a replacement but the wife was already done
Probably won't go back and that's a shame because the ambiance is better than most Mexican restaurants"}
{"text":"Adam was a wonderful server as well as his crew of food servers. My meal of spicy black beans and chili Colorado relleno was amazing. The Cadillac margarita was smooooooth! We asked to have the fans turned down and he actually accomplished it!  Was a bit loud in the place so be aware. Plenty of free parking. Live music on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"This is the best chile relleno I've ever had... Chile Colorado beef with Christmas sauce is the best way to go in my opinion.  I've had other things on the menu... they're good and I don't think you can go wrong, but the chile relleno is amazing.  sopapillas for desert were also great.  I would choose Pento Beans and rice for the sides... again well done.  I'm so glad this place is in the area... I take all out of towners here.  Lots of Tequila choices.  Only knock I would say is that sometimes the margarita can vary a bit with regard to its greatness."}
{"text":"We would have given it the full 5 stars if it weren't for the weak and flavorless margaritas we got.  This place has a \"tequila bar\" and as my husband and I are huge margarita experts (we think so, lol),  we ordered the Enchanted margaritas which stated that it had two shots of tequila in it and to be prepared.  Not even a hint of tequila flavor at all.  The food however, was really flavorful and satisfying.  We opted to order ala cart as we wanted to sample before committing to a large entree plate each.  We loved the chicken enchilada in green sauce, the blue corn tamale, and had both the black and pinto beans.  Yum!  And honestly plenty enough.  The chips and three different types of salsa were good too.  We will definitely be returning but will opt for a beer instead of a margarita for sure!"}
{"text":"Not a first timer by any means and probably say it everytime but tonight was exceptional. Brad gave awesome service and totally steered us in the right direction with his picks. Life really is too short to drink cheap tequila."}
{"text":"It was not what I expected. I opened the Menu and it was full of salsa just nasty so I was already a little turned off. We ordered our food and a Margarita it tested like their was no alcohol in it. My fork and knife where very dirty so I too, one of another table and it was  little bit cleaner. When we came in their was a table across from us with about 7to 10 people they left shortly after we came , you would think somebody would clear that table.Not so,when we left it was still dirty with all the dishes and food etc. I don't think I will come back. The only good thing is that our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had guac for appetizer...delicious!  Goes well with the trio if salsa that comes with the chips. 

All three in my group ordered the blue corn enchiladas.  The red sauce was very good.  Chili Colorado stuffing phenomenal!

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have no idea what kind of customers are giving this place so many stars. What must they be eating at home? The only good thing that I can say about this place, was that our waiter was very nice. But even he did not bother to ask us if our food was alright. The fajitas only flavor was rancid meat. I mean, it tasted old! And how do you call a cheese crisp a crisp, if it's a soggy mess? I had high hopes for this restaurant that was sitting empty for so long. But it was not to be."}
{"text":"A+++ New Mexican food!!!  Born and raised in NM and moved to Gilbert.  No other Mexican restaurant here in Gilbert compares.  Taste like good, old fashion home cooking. My new FAVORITE!!!  Angel my server was the BEST...GREAT personality!! If you don't eat here, you are missing out!!  Treat yourself to some true New Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good Mexican food in Gilbert of all places! As good as if not better than the real Los Dos Molinos in Phoenix (the dump in Mesa isn't really Los Dos). Beautifully decorated, fast servers, and arguably the best Mexican food in the state! The food was spicy and delicious but never inedibly hot as it sometimes is other places."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. I'm a huge fan of their chimis and fajitas. My husband loves their mexican pizza. This is one of our date night favorites. The atmosphere is wonderful. They have live music in the bar on the weekends."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos were like Mexico. My beef burrito Christmas style was one of the best I've had in years. Fast service. Three salsa with the chips were spicy and good. Best part was the house margaritas.  They are as good or better than Cantina Laredos and only $7.  Anew favorite Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Sunday night and even though there were two large parties we well taken care of and received our orders in a timely manner. I appreciate a place that has great chips and different salsas of varying heat. So many other Mesa/Gilbert Mexican restaurants bland it up for the snow birds but the food was great and the place was new and clean (yeah it did look like a Scottsdale \"art\" gallery but who cares)."}
{"text":"This was our second experience at this restaurant. Won't be back. I ordered a shredded beef burrito. Kind of hard to screw up. It had more chunks of fat in it than I would even give my dog. 

I brought it to the attention of the manager who comped us a margarita, otherwise this would be one star.

Now, the salsa was incredible--a bright spot, but the bagged tortilla chips, not so much.

Back in the day the restaurant was a \"Chuy's.\" Now THAT was good food (and drink)!"}
{"text":"Yes, as good as it gets is right! Our first visit tonight and service was excellent, food was fabulous (deep flavors!), great experience. Our server Charles was not only accommodating but pleasant, was very patient in answering our questions in the heat of a very busy Saturday night, and took the time to make great recommendations. We were very pleased with our choices. Heidi was working tables and never stopped, never slowed down for a minute. Her eagle eye was on top of everything. Excellent service all around, excellent food, excellent service and a very pleasant owner. We WILL be back. Thank you to all."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a bit of a whim on a Friday night.  We'd seen the restaurant, and had wanted to check it out and we finally did.  I was a little trepidatious because Friday nights can be really busy, and some of the review of this place weren't the best, but we wanted to see for ourselves. 

Overall we had a very pleasant and delicious meal, and we will definitely be back.

We probably got there about 6:20, and as expected they were busy.  We were told the wait was 20-30 minutes. There was no room at the bar. But the patio was available and they had misters. Since it wasn't too hot a night and we were hungry we went on the patio. This worked out okay, except they really have some kinks to work out on the misters -- the only tables available were drenched with water and the mist was too strong to sit under the misters. We ended up moving the table (which didn't really help), and then switched tables to a drier location. The road noise wasn't much fun, but what can you do about that? There is a TV on the patio, but it didn't appear hooked up yet.

Once we got that figured out, things went smoother. The servers were attentive and helpful, knowledgeable about the menu.  The pacing of the meal was a bit off --we just got our drinks when the food came out.  I'd have liked a bit more time to enjoy the drink first.  (BTW, my husband doesn't agree -- he was hungry and thinks the timing of the food was spot-on perfect!  LOL!)

I had the 'Make your own burrito chimichanga style' with the adovada and red sauce.  My husband had the Farmers burrito with the adovada.  We both had the Cadillac margarita with the house tequila.  The chips were plentiful and the 3 types of salsa fresh, homemade, and delicious. Keep ice in your water glass to help cool the tongue after enjoying the red salsa - Mmmmm!

The burritos were large and filling - no skimping on the meat.  We asked for extra cheese on the burritos but didn't receive it. They forgot to bring the sour cream that was advertised to be included with my meal. The margaritas were very good - no complaints.

The server confirmed that the owner is a son of the owners of the Los Dos Molinos restaurants.  One of the items I love at Los Dos Molinos is their adovada pork (oh and also their salsa!)   If possible, La Rista is doing both of these better than his parents.

I believe the owner has some kinks to work out in their service and some training issues (like pacing and handling special requests), but the food and the drinks were very good and the location convenient for us.  Process improvement and training is easy -- getting the food and atmosphere right is the hard (and most important!) part. (P.S. I suggest a small prepping table on the patio to help the servers.  When Ivan came to take our order, he had a water jug, and there was no place to put it so he could write except on our table.)

And guys, this isn't a national chain -- it's a local guy trying to build a business and providing jobs in the community. This is something I'm willing to be supportive by giving him a chance to get things working smoothly."}
{"text":"Not bad :) stopped here for lunch during the work week and had really good service. I had the rellano plate, someone else ordered the burrito bowl and the third had tacos. Everyone liked the food and the chips and salsa were good. My only complaint is that my rellano oozed grease when I cut it open. Needed to drain or something before it was placed on the plate."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food! I had the blue corn pork enchiladas and it was delicious. Nice setting, great service, and good prices."}
{"text":"Definitely worth coming here!  The food and staff are great with very reasonable prices.  Really nice environment and a nice selection of tequila."}
{"text":"The blue corn enchiladas were fantastic along with the the bacon wrapped shrimp.  They did the fried ice cream with expertiese."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Very nice inside. Brad, our server, was very helpful with the menu. Great food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, check them out.  Authentic Mexican with dishes you won't find anywhere else.  Amazing service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful celebration dinner last night at LaRista. Our server's name was Angel. He was fantastic! The food was very good the portions were more than adequate and the margaritas are amazing. We've been to this restaurant several times, and it's always been very good. I liked that they took reservations and we got right in when we arrived."}
{"text":"This place opened in June and it was really nice. The food is New Mexico flavor. Everyone in our party ordered something different and I didn't taste anything I didn't like; it was all great. It is a family owned business and they were all so friendly. I would diffidently return for anther meal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh Mexican food this is the place. We came in based on the yelp reviews and we are not disappointed at all! Chips and Salsa yum yum! The Mahi Mahi tacos were super fresh. The tacos were so crunchy and the enchiladas fantastic. I got the carne asada it wasn't chewy, super tender, great flavor. The portions are perfect size. They have pinto or black beans, they had the perfect seasoning. High quality Guac and high quality sour cream. Not that purée and canned stuff. We also ordered sopapilla, delish! Besides the food being so yummy. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. If you are a larger person there's plenty of room, more tables than booths and they don't pack you in like sardines. The staff is attentive and friendly even on a busy Saturday night. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Have gone to Laristra 2 times.  Both times good food and good service.  Prices reasonable too. $2.00 beer specials on weekends great.  Dont know if they have happy hour during week.  Would be great of they do."}
{"text":"My husband and I just left after our first visit to this place and it will be our last. I got the stacked enchiladas and the fried egg came out burnt on the edges with the middle part of the white completely raw. The rawness of the egg was obvious by the clear gelatinous coating near the yolk. We complained and the manager offered to get us a new egg (this was 15 minutes later after I was done eating). My husband said we didn't have confidence in the cook's abilities with eggs. She responded \"trust me, we know how to cook an egg.\"  Really?  Because from your performance so far, I don't think so. Even without the half-raw egg and over-confident snippy attitude, it was bad. The meat was bland, the vegetables too greasy. My husband said his carnitas were so-so.  Basically, La Ristra is really into their tequila variety and the food is an afterthought. 

You may want to try the tequila to wash down the dry plate of uncomfortableness if you happen to bring a little boy with you. The presence of the young family's son the next booth over prompted an unsolicited story of their server's dreams of having a son which were not realized due to his girlfriend's recent miscarriage.  

In sum, La Ristra needs to focus more on their product and service and not just the selection of their alcohol. Although being drunk might make the experience more palatable."}
{"text":"Just ok. My husband and I are new to the Chandler/Gilbert area and we checked out the restaurant because the reviews looked good. We sat at the bar, it was very busy and there was only one bartender taking care of the bar and the restaurant. We ordered a Cadillac margarita which was just ok, not much flavor. Our second margarita we ordered a skinny with a grand Mariner float. It was better than the first but not great. Food was ok, service fair. We will move on to other places."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food in town! Great happy hours prices and fun environment! Love their margaritas!"}
{"text":"Wow, Wow, Wow! Where do I begin with how amazing this place is? Amazing food, strong margs, and friendly bartender that actually know how to talk Tequila.  Get in here...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We are pretty picky with Mexican food being from New Mexico so, believe me when I say, this is great food!! While it's not over-the-top in atmosphere, it makes up in food and service.  I had the Chile Relleno and have to say it was one of the best I've ever had!! The fajitas my niece got looked really good too. My mom had the Spanish Flan and it was quite tasty. I'm definitely bringing my hubby back.  The salsas were also great.  My favorite was the green.  Definitely recommend giving this place a try !!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and so was the food. We had the house margaritas, probably the best house margaritas I've had. Great atmosphere. Sorta hard to find. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went in after seeing it nearby us on Yelp. The service was outstanding! I ordered the flauta and a chicken enchilada. Very good but I do enjoy my flauta with guac and it was 1.99 for a small side of it. My food was good. I got both red and green sauces on top of my enchilada (they call it Christmas). Highly recommend doing that! Pretty tasty. My husband got the chile relleno and he said it was very delicious. They only thing I felt was a con was the prices. The items were a little steep for what you got. I'm not expecting huge portions in fat America but for what we got I wasn't expecting it to cost as much as it did. But overall the food was very good and the service was great."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could. I never left a restaurant so satisfied with everything, especially the service. I have dietary restrictions thay pretty much makes it impossible to eat at a Mexican or New Mexican restaurant, so I just in general end up avoiding those because it's so complicated to ask them to basically re-invent a dish for me.However, today is my husband's birthday and he really wanted New Mexican food, so I wanted to do everything I possibly could to make sure he would have a great birthday. So I  called the restaurant and asked in advance if they could prepare one of their dishes differently. They said they could, so my husband and I came in for dinner. When I asked the server, Caleb, about it, he went above and beyond to make sure that my food was cooked the way I could it. He called the owner, John, who was absolutely amazing! He pretty much re-designed the dish so that I could have it. They both made the accommodations that I needed with a big smile on their faces and great patience. I have eaten in many restaurants in my life, in many cities and in the different countries and I have to say: this was by far the best service I have ever experienced! These dietary restrictions make it so hard for me to eat out, so I am deeply grateful that they were so incredibly accommodating and so understanding. I recommend it 200%! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The other day I came here with family, really disappointing. Restaurant wasn't even busy and it was a Saturday night. Ordered the Mac n Cheese on the starter menu and absolutely disgusting. I like spicy foods but bite after bite of nothing but green chili you can only taste hot and nothing else. Looks like they used noodles from a craft Mac n cheese box, and cheese was completely runny and didn't even taste like cheese. Added grilled chicken to it as well and that was even worse. Tasted like he chicken had been frozen and heated in the microwave."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicous and great service. Ordered the nachos on happy hour with shredded beef which won the table over. Tried the stacked blue corn enchiladas with beef as well which was excellent, also tried with pork and was somehow even better. Highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was OK not my favorite Mexican restaurant tho. Our server Matthew was terrific."}
{"text":"Went back again. I just don't understand the reviews about \"too hot\" or \"not New Mexican\" New Mexican cuisine is supposed to be spicy as opposed to \"Mexico City\" cuisine such as La Parilla Suiza. This is great flavorful, and spicy food. There are non-spicy options, but the spice is what I love. Great food, great service...and an incredible selection of Tequilas. Just a great place and I love it."}
{"text":"Been here 2x now.

I saw the bad service reviews and wanted to try it twice to see if the experience was consistent.  Both times - excellent.  Our server(s) attended to everything on time - every time.  Service was spot on.  

The food was the best part.  I'm an AZ original and have been eating this family's restaurants for decades.  The youngest member of the family to open this new La Ristra location has captured the flavorful art of time-tested New Mexican inspired dishes and added a little different twist at the same time.  The best part is still the Hatch chilies that bring this menu to life.  

I had the adovada ribs on my first trip and loved them.  Cooked until they were falling off the bone and covered in a rub that was hot but not ridiculous.  Very good with the house margarita and black beans and fresh tomato slices.  

On my next trip I rolled up on the traditional New Mex burrito with carne adovada and green sauce.  Again - hot - not stupid - and loaded with flavor.  The tortilla had been slightly crisped before being made enchilada style (melted cheese and a crisp tortilla is always good) and the rice and beans were spiced perfectly.  The whole plate worked well.  

Everyone's food arrived in a timely fashion and came out hot/fresh.  

They've won my business - I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The food was very good, especially the \"Stuffed sopapilla\" with shredded beef and \"Christmas\" sauce!  YUMMY!  The owner was very personable and accommodating.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about the Tequila.  They may have had a few struggles here and there, but the food and tequila is worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was really good the last time we were here, not quite as good this time, but still good. Recommend the chile plate, just be sure to ask for extra tortillas. Fried ice cream was terrific."}
{"text":"After having lived in New Mexico I'm always trying to find good New Mexican food out here, and I was excited to try this place based on the reviews. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I wasn't a fan of any of the trio of salsas, but salsas can be a very personal taste. The blue corn enchiladas with shredded beef, christmas style were extremely bland. I kept thinking if I ate more they would get better, but they got worse as I became more disappointed in the lack of flavor. The beef was moist but I couldn't seem to find a hint of flavor. I also expect green and red chile to have a kick to it and I didn't notice any spice. The atmosphere was great and they appear to have live music. The sangria margarita was delicious. I wouldn't come back for the food but it seems like a fun place for happy hour if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I found La Ristra on groupon and decided to give it a try.  We were extremely happy with the service and food.  I got the pork burrito with red and green sauce on top.  Perfect amount of spice and taste.  We are glad we tried it and will me coming back soon."}
{"text":"Wait....I've lived by this place this entire time and never came here????? This place is fricken delicious! This place is so good, I tried to take a picture for my review and I didn't want to stop eating to do it (lol I said do it!). Not only is the food amazing but Angel is the greatest waiter and person I've had the pleasure of meeting! I didn't even order. We told him to bring us his favorite dish and this beautiful entree with an egg came to our table! Angel thank you for making it such a great experience and thank you \"Ladies Night\" for the cheap beers! We are definitely coming back! (Lol I said coming)!"}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant with excellent food.  We have put it on the weekly rotation and have had great food every time!  Service is always good and Andrea, the owner is just wonderful.  Recommend the green chile, enchiladas....heck everything.  Oh and enchanted margarita is perfect"}
{"text":"Loved the outside patio seating. Nice atmosphere. Once we ordered from our server Brad, our food came super quick!! His suggestion to order the Blue Corn Enchiladas was right on! The pork was spicy and good - not dried out at all. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in El Paso, Central Arizona, and Albuquerque for many years and have loved New Mexican style foods (e.g. Sadie's, El Pinto, Julio's Cafe Corona, Tomasita's Santa Fe Station, Maria's New Mexican Kitchen, Rancho De Corrales, Los Dos Molinos, etc.).  La Ristra is amazing - I love their fresh salsa selections.  Try the lunch special - it is sure to fill you up (ends at 3PM) and is very easy on the wallet.  The Margaritas are fantastic so I will suggest you don't drink and drive!   This is a very busy restaurant so it may take a while since everything is prepared to order - but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is truly the best of both worlds! You got a really great vibe, perfect place, and perfect New Mexican food. The rice here is done to it's perfection. The Calabacitas is singlehandedly my favorite side dish out of any restaurant I have ever been to! I could just go to La Ristra just to get Calabacitas and would leave as a very happy man. Everything here is great. They completely understand that some people love spicy, some love less spicy, so they always treat you to three different salsa's which at least one of them will surely find success in your pallet. Great place to go, if you haven't yet, go!"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant has become a staple to Gilbert. Over the past couple years as I've visited the are I have made it a point to come by and have at least a couple meals each time. I've never been disappointed, but will say that they have definitely hit their stride to where as a guest you can tell"}
{"text":"Food is great, especially the ribs. Service isn't very good. For whatever reason they do not like to refill your chips, even after we ordered the trio dip. Got the dip, but no more chips! This happened on at least 3 separate occasions. I mean seriously? After we got our food, the waiter disappeared. We had to go ask someone else for our check. They either need to hire more staff or hire people who are better at managing their time. We love the food but might not go back because of the terrible service. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Would have given 4 stars but the fajitas were meh. BUT the Carnitas are a Godsend! Literally the best i've had! we will return!! Spicy but flavorful!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We have been coming here for a while and since you got a bartender named Cherisse we are so happy with her service she always remembers our orders our names  stories I've told her about my family. She is such a beautiful person inside and out go see her the food is amazing.  I feel your restaurant scored when you got her"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for dinner one night and we were not disappointed. We ordered a variety of appetizers and they were all so yummy!  We also had a flight of margaritas and OMG every single one was delicious! I want to go back and sample all of them."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!  Service was excellent!!!  Margarita was wonderful!!!  Definitely coming back for a tequila flight next time.  
The only negative was a customer with a huge dog seated inside the bar area that stopped at every table as he was leaving because the owner said he was trying to socialize the dog (my husband is allergic)."}
{"text":"Absolutely five star food and service all around. This may be our new favorite Mexican (New Mexican) restaurant. 

For starters, the chips and salsa (three unique variations) are amazing. Right away, our waiter noticed that our children were a little fussy and offered to bring out their meals immediately. 

We could not have asked for faster, more attentive service. On top of that, the manager came by to check on us three separate times, and offered his suggestions to meet my wife's dietary needs.

As for the entrées... simply delicious! I had the blue corn enchiladas with steak, and my wife had the carne asada. 

We visit Arizona once or twice a year, but will definitely put this on our list of places to visit every time we are here. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town. Staff is friendly, food will not disappoint and the owners John and Andrea provide an amazing experience. Cocktails had a great balance, food had a nice spice when warranted and we will definitely be back.LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommend this place if you enjoy some New Mexican cuisine in your life. 

The chips and salsa are a great way to start it off- my only complaint (if there is one) is that the salsa bowls aren't big enough! That's ok, it helps me save room for the entree, which is worth saving room for!  I have had the blue corn enchiladas,  which are great, and this last time I had the adovada burrito Christmas style - wow! So flavorful and so tender. Food like that keeps you coming back,  that's for sure! Oh and the black beans were great too... Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for the rice but my fiance had no trouble finishing it up! I saw their orders of nachos (which you can also get with adovada) and they're definitely big enough to share. 

I know they're also a tequila bar but I haven't tried any- yet. With food like that though, I know I'll be back and maybe I'll give it a whirl next time!"}
{"text":"We finally gave this place a try for lunch on July 4th.  We had great service; greeted the minute we walked in the door, seated quickly, received water asap. Our server came out with chips and salsas, explaining the heat and spices of each. After looking at the menu he offered to answer any questions we might have. We weren't rushed or made to feel like it was an eat-and-go type of place. The sauces are spicy, but I say most folks know that New Mexico Mexican is not like your run of the mill Mexican food. They traditionally use more variations of chilies with different levels of heat. Don't fault the restaurant. When I try something new, I want something new. Our food was great. I tried the green corn tamale and pork enchilada, both with green sauce, black beans & rice. Thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband had the blue corn enchiladas from the specialties section of the menu. The pork was tender and flavorful. Not too hot but 'warm'. The portions are quite generous. My only issue was that my food was not nearly as (oven) hot as my husband's plate seemed to be. I believe my food was ready before his. Other than that it was a great lunch experience. The next time we go we'll ask to sit in the bar area at the tall tables. This is a family friendly restaurant. I wouldn't say they cater to kids, but you can feel comfortable dining there with young ones. Sometimes I just want to sit with the grown ups, so that's why I'll ask for the bar area."}
{"text":"Have been there several times since it has opened. Very good mostly New Mexico style Mexican food. Really like the Green Chili Burger, the Pinchos Adovada, and the Green Chili Stew. Great happy hour with good appetizers, though a good cheese crisp will do it for me with a draft Dos Equis and a shot of premium Tequila. Over 100 Tequilas to choose from.
Great that it's in Gilbert which really suffers from a lack of grownup non-chain places."}
{"text":"We went this past Wednesday, and the food was fantastic like always. The service was outstanding. The staff are really friendly and make you feel you're among friends. We started coming about a month ago, and we have been back five times. The burger is really good. I've also had the chimichanga. The sides are just as good too."}
{"text":"Since moving from the west valley we had not found a restaurant comparable to Los Dos (my absolute favorite). Tried La Ristra tonight and thought food was excellent. Angel provided excellent service. Kids loved the cheese crisp and bean burrito. We will definitely be back. Still love Los Dos but the 5 min drive makes it my new Favorite New Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not very authentic New Mexican cuisine.  The green Chile is bland.  Our waiter was very nice.  Unfortunately The owner is beyond rude, I don't know how you run a business with that attitude.  Also very expensive and not worth it. Do yourself a favor and go someplace else"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! This is our go to place for brunch! Cherisse makes this experience so enjoyable and will keep us coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"We've been to this place three times now. Should have stopped at two. Here are my thoughts on the food we ordered overall. At each visit, we found that the salsas are all bland and taste like they came from a can. We tried a different margarita each time and watched the bartender use a different style glass but the same mix for all  the variations. The drinks were subpar at best. We had to ask for more tequila at our last visit and only because the distinct taste or hint of tequila was no where to be found.
My husband ordered the green chili bowl. Where I come from,  NM, we do not put carrots and celery in our Chile Verde. There were way too many potatoes as well. It was more of a vegetable stew with hints of pork and green chili. The stacked enchiladas were flavorless and weird. The blue corn tortillas would be best saved for tortilla chips. 
We also tried the Hatch chili and bean dip...yuck! Not good...perhaps they should add the chorizo to this dish to add flair and flavor without charging more $$$.
We were hoping to find a NM style restaurant closer to home. NOT 
We will go back to driving to Chandler for GREAT NM Food!"}
{"text":"House tequila is Montezuma Gold. Haven't drank that crap since I lived in a cardboard box. The server literally messed up every part of our orders; red sauce for green, shredded beef for ground beef, black beans for pinto. And he forgot every extra item we asked for. 

The food was very bland. The salsas were good, so we just doused everything with it. 

The restaurant decor was nice. Not sure what salsa music has to do with New Mexico, but that was the music playing. 

Like other reviewers said : stick with New Mexican Grill.  That place is great."}
{"text":"With just one taste of their salsas, you can tell they are lovingly made fresh in-house. Two of them are very spicy, yet you can still taste the flavors. The mild is good, too; but we prefer spicy.

The shrimp ceviche was flavorful with heat. The plump shrimp didn't stand a chance! Yummy.

The blue corn enchiladas were good. I never thought to put an egg on top of enchiladas, but it was surprisingly tasty. I did need sour cream and guacamole to balance out the taste, though. The black beans were probably the best I've had anywhere. The vegetable medley made eating your veggies fun.

I enjoyed the margarita flight with 4 different flavors: Sangria, Desert Pear, Blood Orange, and something else. The sangria variety was my favorite. For some reason, they didn't mix the flavoring into the margaritas, except the Sangria flavor. They just put the syrup on the bottom and topped it with the base. I bet they would have been better mixed. 

My boyfriend enjoyed his ribs. They were tender.

All of this was only $65, not bad for a margarita flight, shrimp ceviche, and two of the more expensive dinners on the menu (plus extras like guacamole, sour cream, and soda).

I deducted one star because they should have mixed the margaritas. (They were $15, after all.) Also, the flavor of the meat in the enchiladas and the salsas were not my favorite. They were good, just not my favorite. My boyfriend noted similarities in Indian (the country, not Native American) food.

Nick provided excellent, friendly service.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite \"New Mexican\" restaurant! Come hungry because the portions are huge!  The service was excellent.  Our waiter, Arlen, was attentive, affable and knowledgeable. 

They have drink specials, live entertainment and well prepared food.  We loved the chili rellanos!  Every dish prepared with the hatch chilis rocked!

There is a huge parking lot, outdoor seating, large bar area and dining room.  I highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"Nice bar, live music frequently. The food is authentic New Mexican and consistently good. I typically order the enchiladas which come in blue corn tortillas and have an egg on top, recommended!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!   The ambiance is nice.  Great lounge and wonderful selection of tequila's but if you are here to eat - we have way better in this area!   The food is bland and lifeless.   Neither my husband's entree or mine came to the table hot in the middle and they lacked seasoning.  My burrito was soggy and boring.  My husband's burrito was ice cold in the middle.   The salsa's are different but the chips are not freshly made like other venues.   The service is very attentive - honestly and the manager was very polite and apologetic upon hearing about our dining experience.  We will not be back though.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Green chile stew and margaritas, life is good. Second visit, awesome carnitas on the shank, cooled in garlic and herbs and served in a green chile sauce. This place rocks their food!"}
{"text":"Great new Mexican food! Great service!  Brad was our waiter and he was very friendly, prompt, helpful and had good food recommendations.  The salsa is very spicy but very delicious.  Try La Ristra!!!"}
{"text":"Much better, La Ristra! Much better! 

Went back the next night, Sunday, and sat at the bar. There was no one in there and the baseball game was on so it was a good time to drink, you got it, MORE MARGARITAS. I think they should just turn the place into a margarita bar and build on a room for me so I didn't have to go far for the cactus pear margarita. As it is now it's a 15 minute wait from the craving to the delicious taste of those margaritas touching my lips.

I ordered exactly the same thing I did the night before. And guess what? It was steaming hot AND delicious. I couldn't ask for more. The only glitch was that the egg came out over hard on my enchiladas instead of sunny side up, but they fixed it quickly and I was back to enjoying my food again. It was sublime! 

I love this place. Even the waiter, Brad, who waited on me came by and said he was having an off night and to come by again and he'd kick ass for me. I'm totally taking him up on that.  Ken is another waiter with awesome suggestions for drinks/food/etc. He's super personable and I really like his friendliness. They really have great people working there. 

I have now changed my review to: GET THE HELL THERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN."}
{"text":"Service was good. The food is very spicy and not for those who don't have a high tolerance. The chicken tortilla soup with sopapillas was very flavourful and good."}
{"text":"This is the best. We go here to get food that is close to what we used to eat in New Mexico. 

We have tried various things on the menu and all have have been good, except the sopapillas. Too hard, I can make those at home myself! hahaha. Everything else is delicious.

The menu is confusing for me because where I came from carne adovada is not just something added to a burrito or enchilada. I like to eat it by itself, in all of its red chile goodness. I have never been told NO you can't order it that way. They always take my order, and the kitchen delivers it exactly as I have instructed. 

The wait staff is always great and friendly. Each time we have gone, I have questions and each time the staff goes out of their way to answer. If they don't know they will find out. The salsa is good and the chips are always fresh. 

This weekend, August 25-26, they are bringing in a load of green chile from hatch and roasting it! Saving us a trip and time! They only bad thing, and I have complained already, they will not peel it! hahaha.

The best thing about this restaurant is they serve Santa Fe Brewing beer. Brad is a \"Happy Camper\" when he visits. 

This weekend, August 25-26, there is a chile festival in celebration of the chile season in Hatch, New Mexico. I have heard that Santa Fe Brewing is bringing their newest IPA for all to try."}
{"text":"Great new mexican food.  The chilis are exactly what you expect and want:  flavorful and spicy.  We enjoyed a chicken chili cassarole and torta (sandwich).  The cassarole was amazing.  It came with an egg on top and was very filling.  The torta had great meat (colorado chili) but the bun was just an average hamburger bun, toasted.  Also, the chips and salsa here are some of the best we've had.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Coming from California we have high expectations for everything, especially food. This restaurant was horrible, from the service to the food. We ordered many different things and they were all disappointing. Our server got half of our orders wrong, drinks, and an inaccurate bill. This was a disaster, the whole time here."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We love good, fresh Mexican food. The chips were tasty, complimentary salsa was outstanding. Mild is very, very mild. Red is rich, tasty, a little spicy in a great way. Green was also very good. 

We each had different menu items, all plentiful and well prepared. Rice and black beans were great. 

Service, was very friendly. Menu selection was generous."}
{"text":"Really spicy food (which I like but it's not for everyone). Sports game is always on, and usually an older married crowd (50s+). Haven't been here on a weekend but they advertise live music then. Minus one star for service. Drinks are not made consistently, and I often have to ask for happy hour/ladies night pricing to be honored after I review check."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere. A little loud in the dining area and service could have been a little better but in their defense it was Morhers Day so I understand they were busy. Definitely worth a second shot"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I arrived at about 9.00 pm on a Thursday night and there were a few people at the bar. My wife and I decide to eat in the lounge area and saw that it was deserted. The only people who were there were the staff and they were loud as hell! The toilets were a nightmare and the pollo dish that we had was really bad! Although the wait staff was courteous i am sure that i wont go again in this place."}
{"text":"We've been going to La Restia now for the last 2 years. The food is always good with a diverse menu and a staff that are top notch. Owners John and Andrea  love chatting with the customers and always making sure their dining experience was really good. They have a nice variety of tequila and draft beers to go along with your lunch or dinner. If you like Mexico food with a little heat you'll love La Restia."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and it was ok.the food was ok and the service was ok. We had a huge group so the waiter kept messing up our orders. My husband and I might try it out again but we are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"This was the second time we had visited La Rista. The first time service was extremely slow and they sat us in the bar next to a group of extremely loud intoxicated 21 year olds. Tonight we waited over an hour for a table after we were informed it was a 40 min  wait. Finally had to walk out. Definitely not going to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"La Ristra is the place to be! The food was bomb and Jared our service was very attentive and on top of it. We will DEFINITELY become their new regulars haha"}
{"text":"Went here to pick up our order of roasted chile after ordering a 40lb batch through their annual Hatch chile sale and decided to try it out for lunch. My husband had a huge smothered shredded beef burro with red sauce and I had their shrimp fajita burro Christmas style. Both agreed that the green sauce, the flavor, and slow cooked feeling of everything was the closest to actual New Mexican style (which he grew up on with the g-parents) we've gotten in the valley. The green sauce is the star for me, but that slow, cooked beef was also heavenly. Such a good meal - worth the drive from Phoenix."}
{"text":"The salsas are spicy yet delectable.  The setting is fun and relaxed. Lots of options on the menu should everyone happy. Try the spicy margarita!"}
{"text":"I like the food,but the service.....well.....not so much.  Last night was the second time I've been to La Ristra and the second time I have left wondering how they could get by with this kind f service.  If the crowd last night was any indication, they probably aren't getting by at all.  You know it's bad when an employee comes over to your table and has to inform you that he's not your server, and that he has no idea where she is, but he'll do his best to find her for you.  Not only that, but it didn't occur to the guy to take our drink order, we had to prompt him to do that and he said he would \"transfer it to her when he finds her\".

Unfortunately it didn't get any better when our server finally showed up.  It was clear that she didn't want to be there which was made pretty evident throughout the meal because.....she wasn't there.  She only came over once during the meal to offer a refill, which would be ok if the rest of the room wasn't empty and she was busy.  It only got worse when our entrees showed up but the appetizer we ordered didn't.  Our server let us know that she completely forgot to put them in.  That was the end of it, no offer to make it right, no offer to rush an order, nada.

Basically, won't be back due to the service.  Too bad because the food is pretty good.  I guess I'll stick with Blue Adobe for my \"New Mexican Food\" cravings.  Better food and better service too."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego and thought I would check out this place. Jeremy the waiter was so amazing, he was so personable and would engage in stories with us about San Diego, he made our dinner experience amazing from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Just discovered La Ristra and wish I had sooner! First off the service is exceptional. We've sat in the bar twice with Alex as our server who is very attentive and friendly. Secondly the food is pretty great. The chips and salsa served at the greet are yummy and free &unlimited refills are awesome. The menu is fairly priced with a wide range of options. But the reason I will keep coming back is for the spicy bloody Mary's! Best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time. Fun little restaurant with great deals throughout the week!"}
{"text":"Awesome Becka and Angel are great! DH had street tacos with all of his special instructions.(they nailed it) I had the chili rellano plate both were fantastic."}
{"text":"My first time at La Ristra last night & i was very please with everything!

I invited my parents out and they can be very picky eaters but they loved it! We listened to live music & drink their delicious smooth house margaritas! I will definatly come back with my girlfriends & i do recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican restaurant!  We are thrilled to have this place so near to our new home!  We will be regulars.  The southwestern chopped salad with shrimp was amazingly good.  Not something I'd expect from a Mexican place!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening week of a New Mexican Tequila Bar and restaurant!  La Ristra has menu laden with Hatch green chilis, sopapillas, and tapas.  

I started with Papa's Bravas which remind me of a Tapas I'd had in Madrid, and perfect for my 5 year too since, he is sensitive to spicy food.  

The menu has both a Quesadilla and Cheese Crisp.  I had to ask since, to me they were synonyms.  They recommended the Cheese Crisp for kids because it is simpler.      

For me I ordered the Red and Green Chili plate which was a large portion of the Hatch Green Chilis and another red chili which simmers all day with chucks of adovada pork which is flavorful and tender.  My belly is still warm from chilis while I write this review.  It was great portion of meat.  I normally do not finish my food at a mexican food restaurants due to large portions, but this time I couldn't stop eating.  It was delicious.  

Be careful with the 3 salsas that come with the complimentary chips.  Two of the salsas are quite spicy.  

The owners were friendly.  They came around and asking how everything was.  They mentioned they are going to have live music on the weekends.  I am excited to see what they bring in...."}
{"text":"We had lunch here after shopping. Nice
 Not too crowded and the service was very attentive. We used the entertainment app to get buy one get one.

The chips were warm, the salsa was very good, all 3 varieties.

The food was very good. Was enjoyed it and the atmosphere.

This was our second time In. And we will be back for a third."}
{"text":"Our first time there.  Bar on the left (Thursday is Ladies Night so it was busy.  Sat in dining area which was nice but very dimly lit so it made it hard to see menus and my food. One of the only places I've been that had green chili chicken casserole on its menu - VERY delicious along wirh their calabacitas.

Green chili stew was amazing (got mine with a tortilla instead of sopapilla).  If you don't like spicy stay away but boy it was so good and filling!

I will be back to try a margarita as they looked really good too!"}
{"text":"No! No! No! No!
(I could just end my review there.)

A friend was craving good New Mexican green chile and asked me for suggestions.
He scoffed at the first couple - then I mentioned I heard good things about La Ristra.
(I have noted those people and will never take food advice from them again!)
Gilbert is not a close trek for either of us - but in the search for solid New Mexican food, I am more than willing to travel. He also expressed concern about being Brown in Gilbert. I assured him I'd protect him (and my car is white enough to cover both of us!), and finally sold him using the picture of the banana burrito dessert on the menu.

We shared a cheese crisp that was just like any other cheese crisp, but the chips and salsa were good. The chips were really good. I thought we were off to a great start!

I ordered the beef, Christmas style, with egg. (Christmas style is half green chile, half red.) A fried egg on top is common in New Mexico, sides of rice and black beans. My friend had the blue corn enchilada, also Christmas style, with egg; sides of rice and pinto beans.

The first sad sign was when the plates arrived. Each was served with what they call a sopapilla. Well, it's in line with most sopapillas you'd get in AZ - but it is NOTHING like the ones in New Mexico. (If you've had one, you'd understand.)
Neither of us thought our food was bad, per se, but it was REALLY bland. Really, REALLY bland! My friend suggested maybe we went through a wormhole to a retirement home in Albuquerque circa 1983, it was so bland!
Well over half our meals were boxed up. At least we could take refuge in the banana burrito. Well, no. They were out of it.
All in all, it was such a disappointing dinner we were laughing about how we'll look back on it as a bonding experience.

I barely made it home before my dinner wanted to evacuate my body in a violent way - but I am hit and miss with dairy, so I figured it was the cheese, not the rest of the food. Until he sent me a text the next day that dinner pretty much wrecked him. The end. I see no need to go back under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Great food , excellent service. Hands on owner who is very attentive to customer needs. Football Sunday's are lot's of fun. Great food and when it's hatch pepper time jump on in. A great menu and everything I have tried here has been awesome.  And the tequila . . . well that's another great story . . . join the club and try a wide variety tequila. The experimenting and sampling is fun."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Cadillac Margarita is amazing. Food is well prepared and flavorful. Support your local family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"best margaritas ever!  top shelf tequilas are the best.  i had the 3 tacos on the tapas menu.. outstanding."}
{"text":"My mom and I always ask for Chris! He is an amazing waiter. I love the margaritas, we love the enchiladas. The chips and red salsa are very good."}
{"text":"We have been faithful customers of this restaurant since it opened! We are people who eat out A LOT, and the food here is outstanding!! We always go with the New Mexican Traditional burrito plate with adovado pork with green sauce. It is spicy but FULL of flavor! All of their homemade salsas are great too! One thing we love here is the customer service! The owners are extremely friendly and have learned who we are. Our young daughter has severe food allergies to many things so they know she can only eat the tortilla chips! They are so kind & gracious to her! We highly recommend this family owned & operated place! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We've been here once before and it was not a good experience.  My husband got a text that we had won a dinner for two so we came to give it another shot.  The food was excellent, everyone was friendly, and our waiter was attentive.  Glad we came and gave it another chance. We will be back. Sign up for their club, they're constantly sending my hubby specials via text. Oh and Monday is $5 margaritas day and they are yummy."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say the service was great but for all the great reviews, we were a bit disappointed. My husband had guacamole and alacarte beef tacos. The guacamole was awful, tasting more like lemon than anything else. The meat of the taco was okay but not exceptional. I had the tiered enchiladas with the Christmas sauces. It was good but nothing I would crave. I'd be willing to try it again but my husband would not. To top it off, the trio of salsas to go with the chips were average at best."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Wow this is a must try! Ordered the Green Chile Mac with Chicken it was SO good! The atmosphere was great service was even better our waitress was clearly happy to be here! Over heard a gal behind us say this was her favorite Mexican restaurant, when we finished our wonderful dinner we absolutely agree!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am sold on La Ristra! Customer service is Back!
I must come back and try everything on the Menu!
Flavor is essential in any dish and they have it nailed down tight!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and love it!!! The food is so yummy! Margaritas are tasty & priced properly. The Chips & salsa taste very fresh! And the staff is super friendly! We forgot our leftovers on the table, fortunately one of the staff ran it out to our car before we drove off. They went above and beyond! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Being away from New Mexico I really learned to appreciate good New Mexican food and margaritas. I will say La Ristra has some killer margaritas such as the Cadillac margarita and passion fruit margarita. As for the food enchiladas were great although the they claim to be New Mexican I can say they are more of a New Mexican influence as a lot of their food has a gringo touch, as you can see with their salsa's and chile. Overall I really enjoyed La Ristra and would go back. Definitely a great find in Gilbert."}
{"text":"First time to La Ristra and had a great eating experience. Brought the family and we all enjoyed our meals very much, though my meal, the carnitas, was excellent. Tender on the inside, slightly crispy on the outside, paired with potatoes and green chile. 

Our server Jasmine was very attentive, knowledgeable about all the food and cocktail servings, and even told us the story about this excellent restaurant. We even met the owners. My family and I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the service is horrible. Most of my party ordered our food together and one person order later. Everyone got there food and I just thought it was because I got my burrito chimichanga style. Then the person that ordered after me got her food. I asked the waiter named Arlen about mine. He went to the kitchen and came back and said he would moved my ticket to the front as if he was doing me a favor, but I think he never put my order in. He made no apologies.  When my food came out I just asked for it to go because everyone else finished their meal. We had to wait forever for our checks. Then another person in our part didn't even get a check so we had to wait longer for the waiter to make an appearance to get her check. He got it and made no apologies again. He messed up the check and had charged an alcoholic beverage so he had to fix it and again no apologies. But he did blame us for his mistake by saying it was because we switched seats, but not one person switched seats. So there was no reason to be confused. I know customers are not always right but in this case we were. Arlen needs to either A) learn how to be a better waiter or B) learn how to apologize when he messes up and not blame the customers... unless the customers really are to blame.  Please review basic service skills with Arlen."}
{"text":"If this is New Mexican food, than I want to go to New Mexico...  I had the blue Corn Enchiladas, Christmas style and they were great.. I wanted to keep on eating them, but alas just could not take one more bite.    The Cilantro Margarita was so refreshing.       All of us enjoyed our food and margaritas..  

The place is hard to find in the dark, It is on the NW corner of Warner and Lindsay, but  infront of a medical strip mall.   To the west of Big O tire and circle K.  The parking can be tight, so park behind the medical center and walk.  You will want to walk  after eating all the food.

That night we had a very slow waitress, not sure what the deal was, but would not stop us from going back"}
{"text":"Having lived in NM for a short time, we loved the food here, and my kids went crazy for the sopapillas!  Loved the green!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several several times since the first visit, we have introduce friends also.  LOVE the guac.  We always sit in the bar witch is always comfortable and excellent service.  Still love the fajitas and have found the blue enchilada with egg is a favorite also.  Two nights ago we were there and my husband finally tried the enchilada with egg and his comments was \"your right, the egg enhances it.  This is really good!\"  Do not go on a Fri or Sat night, can not get into the bar.
I would like to see them fix up the patio for outdoor dinning.  But even if they don't we will still continue to go there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is 5+ stars when it comes to the food.  We had the stacked enchiladas and a burrito and both were outstanding.  The only reason I dropped to 4 stars is because the atmosphere in the dining room left something to be desired. Looks like the bar area and the patio were quite nice.  I don't give many 5s but this place could have it with a little upgrade to the dining area.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We heard about La Ristra when we wanted to go to Los Dos but it was closed.  Friends recommended this place saying it was a part of the Los Dos family.   Service is top notch!! Food is incredible! Honestly we are so thrilled to have found this place.  Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here every now and then. The first time we were there we got the pork and loved it!! In fact, overall the food is good. I think they have some of the best chips around and they have good salsa. In fact, if it was just for the food I would give this four stars. 

So why did I give them one?! Well, it has to do with the service and not necessarily the wait staff. I have loved the waitress and waiters we have had (except for one). Our second time there we sat in the dining room and the service was soooo slow. What made it worse was I could see my waiter doing nothing but talking (I haven't seen the waiter since). We have sat in the bar ever since so it hasn't been an issue. Our last visit we ordered the fried ice cream which was delicious until we found a hair!!! Ugh. The next time we ordered an entree to split and sure enough, another hair! Honestly this one was sitting right on top and we hadn't started eating yet so it wasn't a huge deal, the waitress immediately took it and got us a new one! However, when the owner brought us the new entree there was not so much as an apology!!! I wasn't looking for a discount or anything but to not even acknowledge the grossness of what happened made me so upset. Needless to say we won't be back, which is a bummer because there food is good. Hopefully they see this and start making the kitchen staff wear hair and beard nets (we saw the chef and there was no net)."}
{"text":"This is it! Look no further! The food is the best, the drinks are phenomenal and the service is awesome. The salsas are delicious, chips are always crispy and warm. The staff at this place makes anyone want to come back!!! My fsmily and I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"We moved back here from Albuquerque a couple of years ago and have  been trying to find a Good New Mexican restaurant. This is the place. When we sat down we were given 3 different salsas with chips. The green chili was our favorite. Our waiter Jared was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested the pork adovada. Amazing!  My husband had the burrito and I had the chili rellano stuffed with the adovada. You have a choice of 2 sides. We both got black beans and calabicitas and they were very good. Great margaritas. Good happy hour. Have a tequila club. The manager Joey came by to make sure we liked everything. We will be regulars!  Patio very nice and dog friendly."}
{"text":"This is our first time coming here. The service wasn't that good. Our waiter was pretty awkward and the people that brought out the food were rude. My son got his food first and finished five minutes before the rest came out. 

The food itself was very bland. We all got something different and they got the orders  wrong. The chicken was tasteless as well as the beans and rice. The pork was okay. The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. If you have a couple of margaritas it won't make a difference what the food tastes like."}
{"text":"We met our adult children at La Ristra last Tuesday evening.  We have eaten there before--nothing to write home about, but centrally located.  Last Tuesday we had terrible service.  It's always busy, so I'm not sure why the staff was having such a hard time.  We ordered beers and after 15 minutes, we were brought a larger size than ordered and the wrong kind of beer.  When the server brought us new beers, they were still the wrong size but the correct beer, so we kept them.  I ordered the special which was beef tacos for Taco Tuesday.  When they arrived, I laughed.  The tiny tortillas had one tablespoon of beans topped with a half teaspoon of meat, and the whole plate was swimming in some sort of liquid.  They were cold.  I ate one but it was so soggy and gross, I could not attempt to eat the second one.  The waitress asked how it was and I told her to please take it back and show the cooks---it was so bad.  She avoided our table for the remainder of the meal until the check arrived.  She had not comped my two tacos, nor had she charged us for the smaller beers which we had ordered.  I assure you I can count on one hand the times I have sent food back. I cook often and we eat Mexican food often. I can't imagine serving anyone soggy tortillas, and we're not sure why the meal was not comped.  With so many restaurant choices in the area, we certainly will choose elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave one star is because the service/server was good. The food came out quickly and server was attentive but the food here was terrible. The table was very sticky and it smelled weird as soon as we walked in. The chips and salsa were the worst I've had at a Mexican restaurant and the food was not very good either. We will not be going back, seeing as there are so many better Mexican restaurants around."}
{"text":"After seeing a review of this restaurant on \"Check, please!\", I was excited to try it out being a New Mexico native.
The bar looks very inviting but we did sit in the dining area which was fine. I half expected nicer furnishings but what they have is okay.
Charles, our friendly waiter, was quick to come to our table and was very attentive and accommodating throughout our visit.
Our party of 5 ordered 4 different meals. The red Posole had great flavor and was a bit on the spicy side - just the way we like it. There is a plain option, however. It was a good portion and contained quite a bit of meat. 
The carne asada was great as well. Our only slight disappointment of our visit was the single, thin tortilla - certainly not authentic. Calabasitas was one of our sides and it was very tasty although had a layer of cheese we didn't expect.
The on-the-bone carnitas was amazing - very juicy and flavorful. It also came with a delicious sopapilla but good tortillas would have been more suitable.
Finally, the blue corn stacked enchiladas were fantastic. I optioned for the green chile pork and the red sauce. Paired with typical pinto beans and some very tasty spanish rice, the meal was filling. The sopapilla on this dish was appropriate.
Because I had a long drive ahead, i didn't partake in any tequila. Something I will return to do soon. The tequila club sounds like something I would enjoy.
Overall this was a great place to eat and all of us would return, maybe often."}
{"text":"Our go to place when craving Fresh Mex. My fav is the chicken tacos. Good atmosphere and restaurant is decent size so we rarely ever have to wait long. Great neighborhood restaurant. Would be 5 stars, but sometimes our check is a little more than expected, but it is always good quality and service."}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in New Mexico for over 4 years and moved to Las Vegas right after our son was born. He just turned 7 this week and we wanted him to try some food from his home state. The food was great, the best New Mexican food I have had since leaving in 2006.  The owners took time to stop by the table and talked with me and my family for about 10 minutes.  Loved the experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always enjoy good service.  Instead of the usual rice and beans as sides, they also offer calabacitas!!  This place is worth trying just for the calabacitas, but I can't resist their green chile pork!!!  Nice atmosphere, great service, reasonable prices...and Green Chile Pork with calabacitas!!!"}
{"text":"There for brunch today. The food is fantastic,  very spicy  and very good. Excellent bloody Mary with salt and chili on the rim. Three of us had the red chili hashbrown stack  each with a different meat and one of us had the biscuits  and green chili gravy. All left full and happy. They also had great gluten free selections.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere amazing delicious food. Just a wonderful all-around Mexican restaurant!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for Mother's Day and weren't disappointed. Four of our party of five bright leftovers home. The food is fairly spicy so make sure to ask about mild sauce if spicy food isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always, hot salsa, frozen margaritas, what more can one ask for. The wide Tequila selection really puts this one off the charts.

Love it, just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"It's been about a year since I was last here. We wanted to try someplace different for New Mexican other than our good old New Mexico burrito stand by place. My wife and I usually just get ala carte burritos and skipped the beans and rice so she got the shredded beef green chili and I got the carne adovada red chili. I called and ordered takeout and when I got there on time unfortunately I had to wait an extra 15 minutes for them to quote bag it up.  Got it home and was immediately disappointed in the presentation of my burrito. It looked like it had been slopped into the container. My wife's on the other hand looked great. As usual the red chili flavor was delicious but there eas barely any meat? We were curious that both her burrito and my burrito appeared to be made with shredded beef. I was personally expecting marinated pork. I suppose next year when we try them again we'll eat in rather than take out."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Best New Mexican food in the Chandler/Gilbert area! The pork and red chile is so good! Great place to spend a Friday evening winding down and listening to live music!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday at 9pm. Acoustic guy in the bar with about 12 people in the whole place.  We must have been blending in with everyone because it was 20 min before someone came and took our drink order, ONLY after we flagged him down.  My girls margarita was weak, so she asked for another shot, that was completely forgotten about, AGAIN, we had to flag down the bartender. 
The bar staff is VERY focused on the regulars sitting at the bar, we seemed like a burden to the staff.  On a positive note, he did comp the extra tequila shot,  but had to flag him down for the check when the acoustic guy started playing old 70's TV show themes.....TIME TO GO!!!"}
{"text":"Brad took care of us like a boss. 5 stars for the food and service. Cannot go wrong with the pork enchiladas."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in before a movie tonight and we're seated right away on the beautiful patio. Chips and salsa was delivered immediately as well as ice waters. It was even happy hour still until 6 on a Friday! I was impressed by the service and ambiance. We received our food quickly and it was awesome! Super flavorful and filling. I highly recommend the blue corn enchiladas! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, but very poor service. Was here on a Friday night and sat at the bar. Bartender was okay but too busy to check in with us on a regular basis. We then moved to a seated table with a rude server. He could not be less interested in his job. He did not check in with us after he served our food. Later, and I mean much later we had to tag him to get our ticket. This is my second time here, and I won't be back again due to poor service. Too bad, because the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great New Mexico cuisine in Arizona! Tired of the same Mexican food offerings, we thought we'd try La Ristra based on previous reviews. Low key & comfortable atmosphere, it has some wonderful options for flavorful food. Our choices included the ubiquitous and delicious green chilis. Started w a cheese crisp for the table; fluffy tortilla reminiscent of a layered filo dough. I had the shrimp tamale special w calabacitas - just the right amount of chili heat & cream sauce, nicely presented on corn husks. Others had the Socorro grilled chicken - tender w a unique & tasty combination of seasonings. The calabacitas were buttery - could have eaten a whole plate of them! Another had the blue corn chicken enchiladas - amazing. Chris was our server, delightful! We'll return."}
{"text":"Yeah... nice place, cheerful and fast service, great drinks, delicious food, very reasonable prices. A great place. Started with the complimentary warm chip and three sauces, which were all top notch. Then I had the combo plate - enchilada with red sauce and a taco. Delicious. My wife had the nachos - very tasty with creamy queso fresco. Yum. Had a Modelo Negra on tap and the house margarita, and my wife had a flight of flavored margaritas - all really refined and yummy. You just can't miss here. Our new go-to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Spicy margarita is amazing (I asked for on the rocks instead of frozen), the chicken enchiladas are the best I've ever had (red and green sauce for sure), love that you can order black beans instead of pinto, the Carnitas were very good, and the banana desert is amazing. We actually went on a Saturday night and there was a guy singing live music from the 90's mostly which was great. The staff is super friendly and they have great service."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place kept popping up on our yelp searches so the man and I decided to give it a try since we love New Mexican style food. We walk in and the hostess says there will be live music in 20 minutes in the bar area at 8pm. Awesome, we think. We sit down and immediately notice how pricey drinks and food are. Whatever, no biggy.. I order the green and red chile plate and he gets the enchiladas. (Mind you, they only have one enchilada option). My chile plate was shredded beef with enchilada sauce on top.. And black beans, definitely canned, and rice. That's it. If I wanted beef with enchilada sauce on top, I can get that at Filibertos. Red/green chile should be cooked in the sauce and very flavorful with a little spice. Very bland! Also, it came with 1 sopapilla to put the meat on. Just 1. So I have a plate of shredded meat with nothing but 1 piece of 3\"x3\" dough to put it on. No tortillas. And if I wanted ONE TORTILLA it was $1.50. Ridiculous. The enchiladas were lacking in everything from cheese, sauce, to meat. He asked for more sauce for his meal and it came in a big bowl with no spoon so he poured it from the bowl. The live music, btw, was so so bad. Loud and not at all dining appropriate. To make matters worse, half way through the meal they seat 4 high school boys literally right next to us.. In the bar area. The entire time they are extremely loud and obnoxious showing each other inappropriate pics on their phones and sarcastically singing along to the live music. Isn't it illegal to have underage kids in the bar area without a parent? If not, it is at least bad management. I thought for a second we were on that reality show \"Boiling Point\". We couldn't get our check quick enough. With that said, service was pretty decent considering the poor guy was by himself."}
{"text":"Coldest drinks & great authentic \"New Mexican\" food! The Blueberry Margarita is soooo good I can't try anything else. Salsa is addicting & I love my shredded chicken taco salad! We are regulars here & love the live music! Especially the GHS teachers that have a cover band - they are excellent!"}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food! Being from New Mexico I judge a little hard on quality and La Rista has some great dishes. The enchilada stack and the calabacitas are amazing. Great margaritas also!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food awesome chips and salsa 
The food was fresh hot and so tasty! We really loved this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Their chile Colorado is so spicy and so good! This is what New Mexican food is all about! So far I have gotten the quesadilla, the blue corn stacked enchiladas, and the chimichanga. All with the chile Colorado and it's just amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a number of times and the food has always been fine. Tonight, we visited and were seated on the patio. It was a gorgeous night and we enjoyed a perfect AZ evening for dining al fresco. We were quickly seated and received drinks and chips immediately. We placed our order...and waited. And waited. And waited. After 45 minutes, we asked our waiter if we were going to be served tonight and he apologized, saying the kitchen got behind. He refilled our empty chip basket and he would send out the manager. Another 15 minutes later, the manager brought our meals. Mine was cold and my husband's came right from the microwave to our table. His first bite was \"mouth scalding\" hot.  No apology. He asked if he could get us some tortillas and sour cream and guacamole. Came back with 2 tortillas and very tiny cups with a tbsp of sour cream and guac. 
When we got the bill, we were surprised to see that we were charged an additional $3 for the two tortillas, $1.99 for the guac and $1.50 for the sour cream. I thought the little \"extras\" he offered were his way of saying he was sorry for the 1 hour wait.  
I felt bad for our server who was attentive and apologetic, but the manager's behavior and actions  were disappointing..
We were pleasant and very polite to everyone we encountered.  If we had been jerks, I could understand, but we were quiet, respectful and undemanding.  Made me sad, because the outcome could have been so different...  I am not saying that I will never eat there again, BUT it won't be at the top of our dining list."}
{"text":"The server was amazing,  paid great attention to our table, this is where the good review stops.  The food was okay,  nothing great but not horrible,  definitely not worth going back.  The manager came to our table to check on everything, he approached our table as if he couldn't wait to get away from us,  it felt very awkward.  When we got the bill I noticed we were charged $2.50 for a \"side order\" of french fries, unfortunately the side order consisted of 5 french fries, literally 5 fries.  When I inquired about the charge, I apologized for asking about the charge and told the server I had an issue paying $2.50 for 5 fries,  he took the bill to the same manager who approached our table like a zombie and we were gifted a whole $1.00 off our $75.00 bill. I was unaware the fries were a side item or I would have asked for more when they brought them to the table.  When they only offered $1.00 off I was very disappointed.  The only good experience was the server and he was the only reason I didn't push the issue further as I felt bad that I didn't know the fries were a side item and he didn't deserve to be put in the middle of a dispute since the manager didn't have the courtesy to come back to the table to discuss the problem.  It's unfortunate,  the manager could have saved a customer but did not care,  we will never be back for something so very small."}
{"text":"Very creative menu. The venue is comfortable with a large dining room with 30 ft ceiling so the noise level is not bad. It has a bar section which seemed comfy and inviting. Ken, our server, was knowledgeable and polite. He had excellent knowledge of the menu and made great suggestions. I had chicken with avocado, rice and black beans.....Yum! I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Almost every Mexican place my hubby and I go to say \"I have to fair warn you it's really spicy\" and it's always a lie (there is no such thing as too spicy in my book or my husband's). But this place, they don't joke around! My hubby had their Carni asada, and it was so spicy he almost cried!  So if you want really good Mexican food (that actually is spicy when they say it will be) you should definitely try La Ristra!"}
{"text":"I love their chips and tasty salsas. Also yummy: tortilla soup and their pork quesadillas- I love this place."}
{"text":"We just stopped in for a quick dinner. Great Happy Hour Selection.  Food came out quickly despite being very busy.  Our waiter Thomas was very personable and knowledgable on the menu. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good nice misters and tv outside. It seamed clean and the staff were pretty attentive. I like when you get chips and salsa they give you three different salsas chips were yellow corn and purple corn. I say what the hey try it.i like that our food was not greasy that's always a plus for me."}
{"text":"I can describe La Ristra in one word..Delicioso!!!!!! First impression was great! We were greeted and sat promptly by our server Nick, he was great! He had a great attitude, he answered every question and also recommended a few dishes that we ended up ordering and mmm...mmmm...mmmm everything was great from beginning to end! Bottom line...they have great salsas, great service, great entrees, great desert, a ton of tequila options (which we didn't try being we were dining with our young daughter,but there will be a next time) the place is clean and welcoming...We live in florence, but we plan on coming here everytime we are in the area that's for sure! La Ristra is a must try if your in the area!"}
{"text":"This is the best new mexican food that I have ever eaten. The hatch chillis are to die for."}
{"text":"A relaxed, no nonsense new Mexican-style Hatch Chiles pretty much on everything. A nice atmosphere quaint relaxed with Mexican music playing in the background. Set in a strip mall Style building the food was good although not expertly crafted. We'll priced for the amount of food you are given."}
{"text":"Friendly folks. Good menu. Generous portions. And 150 different tequilas. Seriously how is this not awesome. The blue corn enchiladas, the Jimmy chunga and the southwestern eggrolls for all very good. Like all the salsas"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that growing up in So Cal I'm used to some really good Mexican food!! I'm SUPER picky, believe me! That being said, we just moved here a few weeks ago and visited La Ristra after a recommendation. SPOT ON MEXICAN!!! To begin with, the chips and salsa set the tone for the quality of any Mexican restaurant in my opinion. They did not fall short here. Fresh, warm chips (both yellow and blue corn), three different salsas, all of which were as flavorful and spicy as I demand.
 
We each ordered our burritos al a carte. They were AMAZING!!! I can't stand when most Mexican restaurants take short cuts by stuffing the burrito with rice & beans and maybe a spoonful of meat. La Ristra does not do that. Let me tell you, our burritos were NOT lacking in the meat department, plus they had SO many levels of flavor and spice my eyes were rolling back in my head with each bite. The Hatch green chilis they use are unbelievably tasty and spicy! THIS was what I expected from good Mexican and it did not disappoint. 

Our only complaint was with the Queso dip we ordered as an appetizer. It was lack luster in flavor. For $6.99 I would have expected better. And, our server didn't have a lot of personality. She never smiled and seemed that perhaps she was not having a good day. That however, didn't mean the service was bad, I just think she needs to be a bit more enthusiastic about her job since she is in the food service industry. 

I can't wait to return and try something else from the menu along with their margaritas. I will post a follow up when that happens. The best part is that we live a short walking distance away so we can try a few of them (-;"}
{"text":"I've been twice now. Both meals the blue corn enchiladas and the stuffed sopapillas were outstanding. This place was started 3 years ago by the son of one of the owners of Los Dos Molinos. More flavor with a little less heat. Salsas are delicious. Fantastic service with a clean inviting atmosphere. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We came in this place and waited 5 minutes to be seated and no one greeted us and no hostess so we left."}
{"text":"Today was the second time I've experienced La Ristras. I ordered the green chili cheese burger with a fried egg. There are few better pairings than a juicy cheese burger with hatch green chilies. The burger was under seasoned and in much need of salt,  the chilies were mild at best and the egg was fried with not an ooze of yolk. Overall I found the food to be disappointing. The chips and salsa were good, the service was fine but the food left much to be desired. On my only previous visit I ordered the Green Chili Stew, it was fine but not any better than I could make at home. I have a huge place In my heart for New Mexican cuisine but this is not filling that void."}
{"text":"Food was good.  However, service was a bit slow.   Our server tonight was joey.  Although it was busy, I noticed that he would put his hands around the rim of my drinking glass, and handled the straws at the top.  Gross! I also noticed at the bar they did the same AND handled the fruit for drinks with their hands as well.  So unsanitary."}
{"text":"I thought both the chili plate and beef fajitas had little flavor. Salsa and diet coke was great. Guess I expect more chili when I order a chili plate. I thoight it tasted dry. Beef fajita had a very strong beef flavor not ideal. I ate here year ago when they first opened and I remember liking it. Note to self always yelp picture so I remember what to order"}
{"text":"Love this place. I had the stacked nachos for lunch with pork, what a perfect size lunch! I love the chile rellenos and the enchiladas, some of the best in the valley. Food is fresh and bursts with flavor."}
{"text":"We moved to Chandler, AZ from Albuquerque, NM where we lived for almost 20 years, it has taken us four months to find decent any kind of mexican food in this town. We Love La Ristra!! We will be back again and again. Have a Spicy Mango Margarita they Rock!!
Even cooler, they have a loyalty program you can join.
The green chile salsa they serve is their hotter and what we liked. Also soppapillas are served ;)"}
{"text":"First time to La Ristra.  Immediately served chips w/salsa and water. Ordered silver margarita and that was a good start.  Took forever to get actual food order taken.  No refills on water or chips/salsa.  Waiter commented he was \"freaking out\".  He did recommend the ribs but admitted he hadn't sampled everything on the  menu.  Food arrived after a very long wait.  New Mexico Burrito was good but not memorable in any way -- underwhelmed is a good word to use.  Also temperature-wise although immediately served it wasn't remotely warm.  Veggie fajitas with additional green chile and jalapeno's had great taste and were served hot! (timing issues between both items being prepared perhaps?)  While there, numerous others tables with other servers were able to order and be served and probably at home long before we were able to exit. Tables adjacent to us were all having the same service issues.  Verdict?  I had friends visit the night prior with great food and service and they were surprised at my comments given their visit recommendation.  So hopefully just a bit of an off night for the place as it looks like a well run restaurant with great potential."}
{"text":"Short Version: Pretty good food. Poor service. 

Long Version: 

First impressions are VERY IMPORTANT. Unfortunately, La Ristra did not make a good one on me. 

My husband and I arrived on a Monday afternoon for lunch. It didn't seem too busy, since the parking lot was only about a third full. We entered the lobby and saw a sign that said \"Please wait to be seated\". The podium was empty, so we waited. And waited. And waited. There was another patron who came in after us, so we all awkwardly waited in the lobby. The worst part is that the bartender could see us standing around aimlessly, and didn't acknowledge us. My husband was about to ask him if someone was working the front, when an employee finally came out. But instead of a friendly greeting, (maybe a, \"Thanks for waiting guys\" or a \"Sorry! Appreciate your patience\") we get a blank stare and all he says is, \"Two?\". We nod and follow him inside. 

We ordered the Carne Adovada Ribs and Carnitas. The food was actually pretty good, and the plates come with beans, rice, and a sopapilla. There was a slight miscommunication with the waiter, and our bill was a little higher than expected. It didn't break the bank, but I don't like being unpleasantly surprised at the end of our meal. 

I have yet to find a favorite Mexican or New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley. Guess I'll just have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's the only place I e been to that tastes the most like authentic New Mexican food. I had the carne adovada chimichanga here and left very happy. We will return!"}
{"text":"Arizona does not know how to do New Mexican food! 
FYI 3/4 of this restaurant is a bar. Service was terrible. Waitress brought out the completely wrong order and when I asked her to correct it, she brought it out wrong for the second time! Finally I asked for a to go box so I could simply take it home and eat and that took way longer than it should have. They do have \"red\" and \"green\" Chile but it is not authentic New Mexican. I can say like some other reviewers that  the chips and salsa were good but I would not go back. I REALLY wanted to like this place but too many negatives! When I finally ate the food I would say it was ok, not terrible, not spectacular but definitely not New Mexican."}
{"text":"I have now been to La Ristra twice, and both times the food has been amazing. The chips and salsa is some of the best I've ever had, especially the green salsa. The house margarita is good, and last night I had some of the papas bravas from the appetizer menu- the description didn't sound too appealing to me, but they were great! 

As for my entree- last time, I got the farmer's burrito chimi style. I asked to get pinto & black beans instead of meat, which they had no trouble accommodating. The portion size is HUGE- it fed me for three meals total. Last night, I got the blue corn enchiladas, stacked with an egg on top, with adovada pork. The pork is incredible- perfectly tender and such good flavor. 

It's a new restaurant, and I think they still have some kinks to work out, but overall I really love this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent in all categories.

The custom breakfast burrito had excellent flavor.

The manager was accommodating and friendly.

I went back for lunch the same day and took a friend.

The Blue Corn Enchiladas were tasty.

I like the atmosphere.

The waiter Tommy was amazing.
See pictures."}
{"text":"I decided to try La Ristra for lunch today. I was seated immediately by the bar tender, quickly served water and chips & salsa. I was told that the green salsa was hot, and the red wasn't as hot. I didn't taste very much heat in either one. I ordered the lunch special, which is one entre with 2 sides. I chose the chicken enchilada with black beans & rice. The only other side to choose from was pinto beans. When my lunch came out of the kitchen, the plate was too hot to touch, but I didn't even need to blow on the food. It was just warm. As for the flavor, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it is pretty bland. 

With 4 stars after 97 reviews, I had higher hopes for the food. As much as I like to support local Mom & Pop restaurants, sadly this will not be one of them."}
{"text":"We were visiting from CA and were looking for a good Mexican restaurant close to where we were staying.   So glad we found this place.  The salsas were excellent. The food was fresh and  had a lot of flavor with the perfect amount of spice. 
Now onto to the service we received.  Our baby was very fussy and needed to nurse.   One of our servers( I forgot her name) walked me to the back of the restaurant and set up a nice little space behind the a divider to give me privacy. She was very nice, understanding and provided such a positive customer service experience that will never be forgotten.  Thank you so much for doing this. 
Our other server, Nigel or a name close to that, he was awesome as well. He was on it. Made sure our drinks were always full and checked on us many times to see if we needed anything . (So sorry, I am horrible with names).   Thank you to the both of you.   We loved the service and the food.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"1 star since I can't go with a 0 or negative stars.  Went here with my son to grab some grub before my daughters play.  Had 45 minutes so some Mexican food sounded good.  Sat on the patio since we didn't have to wait.  Well, that was a mistake!  Waited about 10 minutes to take our order after they took the order from another table that got there after we did. 35 minutes later no food at all.  Told the waitress I was out of time and wanted it to go.  She came back and said they were backed up we were next and it'll be another 10 minutes!  She didn't ask if I wanted to cancel the order and graciously took my money for the bill.  I waited a few more minutes thinking she might bring food but nope nothing!!!!  I paid for two meals and only got a kids root beer.

This was the worst restaurant experience ever.  They did nothing to make it better.  They got paid and screwed me.

The salsa is really not that good at all.  3 types and I couldn't even finish them.  I love salsa and this was crap!  I'm not going back and I will be talking to management to get my money back as I literally got nothing and paid to sit there.  I'd love to review the food but yeah...  I didn't get any to review."}
{"text":"Yummy, inexpensive, authentic New Mexico Mexican food. Wish there was one in Tucson!! I'd be there every week!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have been to in a while! I was curious about this place. I am so glad I decided to stop in! The ambience in this restaurant is amazing, the food was delicious and the service was great! It was my first time here tonight and the owner greeted me an made me feel welcome! If you are wondering about New Mexican cuisine, this restaurant and bar is a must! I had the New Mexican Traditional burrito filled with carne adovado plate Chimanga style with red enchilada sauce over top with a side of pinto beans and calabacitas (Mexican squash and chiles salad). I was blown away by the flavor! There is a common misconception that New Mexican food is too hot, however I was pleasantly surprised at how the fresh ingredients and heat married to make such a great dish! The pinto beans on the side were fresh and I could tell that they had been cooked that day. For dessert I tried the fried ice cream and had to stop myself from finishing the entire portion! Be sure to try this place. I am definitely going back another night with my friends to experience the tequila bar, that's right, tequila bar! There is a huge wall and selection of tequilas! I highly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"Now THIS is the way to have Mexican food!  We tried La Ristra by using a Groupon....we will DEFINITELY be back!!!  Awesome server, Steve, and served immediately with chips and a trio of salsa (two that were hot...and SO good! and a mild salsa....also super delicious!)...then we had the southwestern egg rolls (?)....SO yummy!!!...and finally, our entree!....a full chicken breast (my hubby and I shared this entree), with rice and beans.....this was an amazing chicken breast topped with green chiles, peppers, cheese and a spicy sauce....wow! Super delicious!!!  But wait!...there's more!  My hubby had a cadillac margarita....but I had the \"Sangrita\"...oh, please do yourself a favor, and enjoy the Sangrita!  A delicious frozen margarita with a sangria poured over top...my FAV new drink!  We were greeted by the owner, and without a doubt, we will definitely be back!!!  This is a hidden treasure, but get ready for a long wait on weekends (we heard), Thursday night worked out great for us though!  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Gilbert and were looking for some good Mexican Food. As always we pull up our Yelp app on our smart phones to find the best local cuisine. La Ristra seemed to pique our interest. Sure glad we did, the food was great, salsa was hot and the Margaritas kicked butt. Our waiter Ivan was awesome and service was impeccable.

Glad we found this place and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Matthew was the bomb bartender we had he is very knowledgeable about everything super cute and so fun to talk to Make sure you sit at the bar and ask for him My first time here and he is truly knowledgeable about everything!"}
{"text":"Today I took two lady friends to eat at La Ristra, it was excellent. Everybody ordered something different and everybody loved what they had and said they'd come back. 
I'm curious to try the biscuits and green chili gravy Saturday or Sunday morning breakfast. 
Great New Mexico style food options."}
{"text":"Huge letdown! HUGE. I should have listened to my gut and not gone here because of all the bad reviews, but my husband wanted to try this place.
I ordered take out and I walked in and told the girl I was there to pick up my order. She gave me my total and I gave her my card-she walked away. Another girl came up to hostess area and asked if I had been helped. I said yes and that I was there to pick up my order. She then turns around and looks at a shopping bag with a receipt on it and said \"Jennifer\". I said yes that's me, is that my food. She said yes but you can't have it until you pay for it. I said ok, I understand that but wouldn't it be best to keep it in kitchen under warmers so it doesn't get cold\"
She said oh, well we just brought it up here a few minutes ago. Which wasn't true. I had been standing there for a few minutes. Bottom of food containers were cold to the touch. Got home opened up food containers and it was not what I expected. Very small portions. 
And the Blue Stacked enchiladas were 2 corn tortillas with a mixture of chunks of overcooked and undercooked grilled chicken in between them And the cheese on top of the chicken wasn't even melted. I ended up throwing away my $12.99 plus $1 for the grilled chicken. 
Never going back there again. Ever! They don't even deserve the 1 star I had to give them.

On top of that a young guy with longer hair and wearing gloves comes to hostess area and asks me if I have been helped. He goes to grab menus and smears food on them. I say yes and then he asks people behind me. Then walks away to seat them and goes back into kitchen. I really hope he changed his gloves after that before handling someone's food."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since we are from New Mexico.  The green chile steak sliders were amazing.  I can't wait to go back and try all the different margaritas.  We also ordered our Hatch XHot green chile in advance and they roasted it up for us a couple weeks ago.  I'm glad to know they do this annually."}
{"text":"Every employee we interacted with was extremely friendly and made us feel welcome. More specifically, our waiter, Ivan, was one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was very knowledgeable and personable! 

We loved that the restaurant served authentic New Mexican food. Our entrees were large and extremely tasty. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My family went in there on a whim and found it to be very tasty. What made this an overall joyous experience was our most friendly and charming server Matthew! He definitely made the meal worthwhile! All together very delicious meal. I recommend La Ristra to anyone who wants a nice family orientated Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good.  We've come three times and enjoyed what we ate. Green Chile casserole is by far the favorite. 
I love that ground beef is a choice.  
The service is hit or miss.  Our last two servers were nice but very spacey and kept forgetting our requests.  So bad to the point that we opted to not order their awesome sopaipillas and just get out of there.  The female bartender rocks. It's too bad I forget her name.  

Anyhow we give a 4 star rating. They'd get 5 if the service was more tentative including the reception."}
{"text":"Great place to go! Bartender Joey is top notch with his tequila recommendations. Spicy mango margarita is out of the world. If you want good service, great food, and great drinks this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great food worst service ever. So ordered wife and kids and myself food only 3 out of the 5 plates came out. Which the manger brought them. Apparently they didn't even put a order in for the other 2 small kids screaming for food so they said a crappy sorry then after I was done with my meal they finally brought out my child's plate only one thou even thou it was supposed to be 2 more. So after I pay the check they bring the last one. The funny thing even thou I was nice they knew I was pissed manger didn't even come over and fix there screw up and charged full price for everything thank great food but worst service ever!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service , love the margaritas and food pretty good. Live music is always a plus, location is perfect as well"}
{"text":"We have been to this place twice now and the first experience was a little better than the second. The decor is lacking in the clean category and the patio looks like half storage and half for seating. 

The food is actually very tasty. My husband was very surprised how good the chicken burrito was. It was very full of chicken and not just fillers. 

We won't skip this place, but it won't be our first choice for dinner."}
{"text":"First time... had the stacked enchiladas. Plenty of spicy goodness there. That being said, come hungry and ready to light your mouth up a bit for this one. How does it rate? Great NM style food. Excellent service. Typical ambiance. All in all, a winner in my book. Oh, and if you're a Tequila fan (I'm not... long story), they have well over 100 different types!"}
{"text":"Great prices on a la carte items. I had the chicken enchilada and it was very tasty! Right up there with the best I've had! The pork stew had a good broth base with carrots and potatoes and was simple but had complex flavors that worked! Joey provided exceptional service and I will definitely be returning and trying more items on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I can't get enough of their chilaquiles, I drive from Tempe almost every Sunday for them. The service is great along with anything you order. :)"}
{"text":"The visit here was amazing! The margaritas are very authentic and not commercialized like other places. The food was delicious and carried a moderate amount of heat to liven the taste buds! Service was outstanding and I had a hard time choosing a tequila as they carry 150 different kinds! If you appreciate real New Mexican food then this is the place you want to be. So there's really only one question I have for you. Red or green?"}
{"text":"This is a great find in Gilbert. We have been here twice and very pleased both times. The margaritas are fabulous (Milagros tequila with a hand crafted agave) and well priced. The 3 salsas are flavorful and the mahi mahi tacos were great. 

Atmosphere is relaxing not packed with lines of people like some of the chains close by. I will make this my #1 Mexican stop in Gilbert from now on. 

The only recommendation I would make to give it a 5 star is to just be more aware of refilling water or margaritas, I might have ordered a second if asked in timely manner. So good!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third visit to La Ristra. They were hosting a fundraiser for a local charity, and the place was busy. I found the staff to be very friendly. 
In the past I've had their Carnitas plate and enchiladas but had their farmers burrito on this trip. I have to say, I have been beyond pleased with every meal I've had. The meat was seasoned to perfection, and prepared perfectly. 
I highly recommend several trips here. I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you have lived in New Mexico for an extended period of time.  You know that you have an addiction to Green Chile.  The Bad Green Monkey on your back.  Well I got a great dose of the old Carne Adovada that took me right back to those nights at Sadie's in Downtown Albuquerque (well its on 4th or 2nd street, killer Margaritas too who the hell can remember LOL) I digress....  
La Ristra has some great New Mexican plates, A little fancy, a little pricey and lets just say you won't take a doggie bag home.  But!! By GOD you will enjoy it and I guarantee you will go back only if you are a true Green Chile Aficionado.

Its in an odd place and the decor is reminiscent of a typical New Mexican cafe 

So Man up get ya some green, I dont know if they have wimp food.  My mind kinda goes blank after the first bite and I usually dont remember looking around at anything during the eating frenzy.  Good stuff"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the last year. We really liked the food. One of a few restaurants that serve salsa with a kick and three flavors. The food has steadily gone down hill. We were there last night and it was really bad. I ordered the Carne Asada  and a cheese enchilada on the side. The carne asada was so over cooked, one side had charcoal on it. That side was served face down to hide the cook's incompetence.
Beef jerky would have been better. The enchilada was cold, The cheese inside was solid as a rock, almost as if at one time it was melted and cooled. I could barley cut it with my fork. The beans are can beans and pretty much flavorless, they don't offer refried beans. My wife ordered the enchiladas with an egg on top. The egg was solid as a rock, It must have been left under the heat lamps or the incompetent cook left it on the grill with my Asada. Enchiladas had very little sauce and was dried out. These meals were so unacceptable. The manager came over and apologized and gave a \"free\" desert. I really just want them to serve good food. As my buddy The Big \"T\" says \"I won't be Bock, Hasta La Vista La Ristra\""}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's always a pleasant experience. The blueberry margarita is a must try! 

Great food, great drinks, and great service every time I've been here. This has become a new spot for my friends and I to frequent."}
{"text":"I moved away from California 8 years ago... And this is the best Mexican style food I've had in 8 years. Our server Brad was SO AWESOME! Helped us pick the perfect items off the menu (and suggested some great margarita flavors). I so highly recommended this place. I had to force myself to stop eating or I was going to explode! Full stars for the restaurant and Brad."}
{"text":"We waited for 75 minutes and weren't even close to being seated. The front desk looked and acted clueless. It was truly unbelievable. We left hungry and frustrated. 

The food looked really really good though."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for a quick bite here the other day. We always drive by and think to go in.  The staff was very knowledgable and friendly. Chips and salsa were nice as well. Good was pretty good and prices were fare. My fave was the red tamale. Just note that it is a different taste then Mexican food. It's not bad, but if you are going in for Mexican, you will be disappointed. This is a New Mexican place."}
{"text":"This place is well decorated but DARK...a sconce or candle would be nice. The food was pretty good..a little spicy for me...we would have liked a bigger menu.  Steve provided attentive service."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and never disappointed in the food. Today we had the best server, Jasmine. She was so friendly, more than happy to offer menu suggestions and just all around fun! Best experience!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Don't bother making a reservation unless you know the employees then you can get seated immediately."}
{"text":"Just gave this spot a try for a couple of drinks and an appetizer...and I'm looking forward to going back for an actual meal!  Great bar, nice decor, friendly and helpful staff.  I had the sangria which was really good.  Also had the green chile black bean dip.  Super yummy....but I am a huge fan of black beans.  The outside patio looks really nice and they have live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice looking restaurant with pretty decent service. My mediocre review is due to the food preparation. One year ago, I came here and ordered fajitas. My experience then would have warranted four stars. But last night, I ordered a chicken burrito and it changed my opinion a bit. The chicken itself tasted fine, but it was not seasoned much at all. For some reason, they put corn in their burritos. (?) I like corn, but find it to be an odd burrito filling. My biggest gripe is that they covered the burrito with cheese, but most of the cheese was not melted at all. If I am ordering a hot entree, I expect the cheese to be melted and gooey. My son had a cheese crisp, and his cheese was just barely melted. Perhaps if they work on serving their food at a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more.I should note that I asked for my sauce on the side because I don't really care for red sauce. Perhaps if it had been on the burrito, it would have made the entree hotter. As it stands, I would probably choose other Mexican restaurants over La Ristra. It was just a very \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome authentic and fresh food!! Our first time here and we had the BEST short ribs and stacked enchiladas. All I have to say is this is THE best Mexican food in Arizona that I've had. Thank God for great Yelp reviews! Will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Great atmosphere, great service and most of all great food!  We are Mexican good addicts and the food here bursts with flavor!!! I had the stacked enchiladas tonight with carne adovada... off the charts!!!!!!! They have these veggies called calibasitas ( spell check) that are delicious. You can order them at no additional charge in place of rice or beans... a must try! Dee-lishhhh!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the location and ambiance here. It's so Arizona to have a gem like this tucked away in a Flippin strip mall. 

Food is very good. Service is on point and the tequila is bountiful."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a really good Mexican Restaurant- and saw this on Check Please! so we decided to try it... So Glad We Did!!!.. the food and service was great!  We find that we really do prefer New Mexico style Mexican food. They have lots of choices-- we went with some Tapas to test the restaurant- Cheese Crisp with Green Chiles and 3 Generation Tacos- amazing! delicious! - along with a frozen classic Rita- I had hoped to have room for the Sopapillas- but darn.. no room. will come back-- highly recommend this restaurant for great food and good prices."}
{"text":"Pretty sure my husband and myself had a small case of food poisoning. They charge for extra salsa!!! No Mexican restaurant should ever charge extra and they didn't even inform us when we asked for more. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"My first review as a part of the Yelp community! On to the most important part of yelp, the food! My girlfriend and I were craving Mexican food and decided on this place since it had good reviews. We went on a quiet Friday night and the restaurant did not seem busy. We were greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately. We received water with chips and salsa right away. The chips and salsa were tasty, but I didn't think they were among the best. Let's face it, they're free! Can't really complain about that. The waiter was friendly but he seemed to be in a huge rush despite the fact it wasn't that busy. Most places make you feel more welcomed. Overall, the service was good. 

I ordered the blue corn enchiladas and they were a simple yet appealing. Everyone has their own taste preferences but I didn't care for the black beans or enchilada sauce. The pork was slightly dry but the enchilada sauce masked it well. My girlfriend ordered the vegetable fajitas(vegetarian) and there were a few pieces of meat. We did not say anything because it wasn't a big deal. It happens! The fajitas consisted of onions and peppers, that's it! It wasn't my meal and I felt disappointed for her. I would expect a little more variety. 

To sum it up we were not disappointed but a few things could improve to boost the rating. I would not judge a restaurant entirely based of my first experience but an honest review I would give 3.5 stars to start!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Really liked small details on the menu that made it unique and truly authentic. We moved from the Valley many decades ago. It seems that with each return trip the Mexican restaurants are defaulting more and more to a bland, factory model of generic offerings. This was a rare exception."}
{"text":"Finally tried this restaurant after driving by for months. We sat outside on the patio which was wonderful with the misters. Our waitress, Alex, was very sweet and took great care of us. I ordered the Socorro's Chicken and my husband had the special Mahi tacos. The chicken was a little bit spicy for me but still delicious. The tacos were very good as well. I ordered a house margarita which was very good. The only reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 is because the food took quite a while to get there, but we were satisfied with the chips and salsa as we waited. We enjoyed our visit and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"At long last -- GREAT Mexican Food in Gilbert! 

Mexican food, in all its regions, has always been my favorite. There are few Mexican food restaurants in the valley that I would even consider good, much less outstanding (and I have been to MANY) but, La Ristra was a surprising find for us! 

With the exception of a lukewarm greeting when we walked in the door, the service was exceptional. Caleb, our waiter, made many recommendations and gave us a little in depth information about the restaurant. The food (oh my gosh) was SO good. I could compare it to my long time old favorite Los Dos Molinos, but I'd have to say it was much better. Service aside, while the food had all its flavor, it wasn't nearly as hot (just the right amount) so it was much more palatable overall. 

Don't let me forget about the margaritas. I just had your standard La Ristra margarita (on the rocks, no salt), nothing fancy at all, and I loved every last sip of it. The chips were still warm, and the three different salsas were both equally as good as every thing else we tried. The Blue Corn Stacked Enchiladas with Adovada Pork, served with a fried egg on top, was nothing short of el paraíso. 

I think I'm in love. 

This little gem is kind of hidden away. It's in a little shopping center just around the corner from downtown Gilbert so its convenient to get to, but you don't have to contend with the traffic or the crowds like you otherwise would.

If you haven't yet been, GO. And bring your appetite with ya."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my burrito. Great tasting food. Even though I have been here a few times I always forget how spicy those green chilies can be! I really enjoyed the vegetables and rice was nice and fluffy. 4/5 stars for La Ristra. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is hard to find tucked away in commercial pad with Urgent Care, Insurance Co and a school.  We came because of a Groupon and we heard from several foodie friends this place was very good. 

We came on a Wednesday evening and at first there were not very many customers even though they had happy hour until 6pm.  We got a table right away and the service was extremely slow.  We had we think a new server......although he was super nice he was a little unorganized and it took forever to get our drinks, order our food and get our food.  Once we got our food it was all excellent.  The green chili everything was excellent, the adovada burrito was delicious and even better the next day as left overs.  We really, really love New Mexican style and everything was absolutely delicious.  

If you are in the area...this is must try.  Hopefully, you will get better service but it was definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time for lunch w/ a friend who's a fanatic of this place (he was there opening day and bought several pounds of the fresh roasted hatch chiles). It wasn't too busy, but it was mid week lunch which I imagine most other restaurants are less busy at this time also. I've driven by after work and seen the place pretty busy, especially on sports nights. My friend said there are often 45+ minute waits for dinner on weekends.

I had a lunch plate of 1 item plus rice and beans for $6.99 which is a really good price. I spend more than that at Rubios which isn't as good. The chips and salsa are great- they serve 3 kinds of salsa. A green which is pretty hot, red, and a garden style with corn and chunky tomatoes. My chicken enchilada was very moist and had good flavor. I had it covered \"christmas style\" with red and green sauce.  Our server/bartender JJ kept up on refills and additional chips and salsa. 

They have several decent sized tv's up on the walls with ESPN etc. Plenty to keep you entertained.  The bar looks pretty well stocked, I heard they have a good selection of tequilas. We learned about some new items and dishes that are coming to the menu, which is a little small but it allows them to do the dishes better. Focus on what you're good at and own it... anything with the green chiles are awesome (said my tablemates)."}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi tacos were amazing. Service was great and the overall atmosphere was nice. I will definitely come back to try something different!"}
{"text":"Make this short and sweet the food and service was excellent short ribs carne Asada  and farmers burrito all were super tasty you must come here !"}
{"text":"Please take the time to enjoy their food. It's the best New Mexican quisine in the metro. They blend traditional dishes with they're own flair.  Staff is prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable.        Our party of four ordered four different entries for dinner and each was delicious. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Came in with my groupon. Service was excellent, the manager brought out food and checked on us while we were eating. House margarita was yummy, as was the carne asada. Socorro Chicken was ok, chicken was just plain, but cooked well. The star of the show was the red salsa! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't stay away from their blue corn enchiladas. They're so good. I can see where some people could complain about their food being a little bland, but since I'm pregnant, I gotta stay away from spicy stuff  anyway so it's not a problem. ;) I do wish they had better salsa, but overall, I enjoy the food, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Not the best.  Was looking for a unique Mexican restaurant. Ordered the Carnitas, and what I got was a charred ham hock....flavorless, full of fat and so burnt that you couldn't bite it.  The guacamole was bland; the rice and beans were cold to the touch.  We ordered the southwestern egg rolls...although flavorful, they were SO greasy that they needed to be dabbed on a napkin before eating.  It was like grease chapstick.  Reordered the Farmers burrito and what was suppose to have black beans, corn, tomatoes, cheese and shredded beef.....only had shredded beef!  Very disappointed!  Maybe it was the time of day....but won't return.  They are trying to be fancy but fell flat on flavor!  The manager on duty came out and said she was sorry for not being able to make anything we liked...then walked away.  Hmmmm."}
{"text":"Been going here since they first opened up and so far we have always had good service and great food.  We try to get there for Happy Hour and enjoy their 2 for 1 Enchanted Margaritas, of course they have a huge tequila selection to try. The owner always takes a minute to greet us and then will follow up to ask us how the food was.  Their Adovada Pork is seasoned and spiced just right and those Pork Carnitas on the bone ares always tender and taste wonderful!"}
{"text":"Our server, Jake, was awesome! And the food was just as amazing! I had the carnitas and my dad had the chile relleno, both were so full of flavor! The owner, John, is so nice and had us try his homemade choco taco which was also excellent! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of this place. The hostess was all over the place and she even let people that walked in after us seat themselves because they saw an open table? It would have been fine if we weren't already waiting for 15 minutes.... um, what? 

Then we were seated but our waitress didn't show up until we were done with our chips and salsa and waited on the table that was seated after us...?? It was kind of just a mess...

Food is not good. Super greasy and leaves a terrible taste in your mouth. Everything seemed like it was microwaved. Only good thing was the margaritas but we asked for our rims to be salted and of course they were not. There are so many great Mexican restaurants in the area I don't know why you would EVER settle for this place."}
{"text":"We come here regularly, the service is always good, and the food is even better. I've never had anything I didn't love. Additionally, they have some of the best margaritas in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This was much better than anticipated! For starters, chips n salsa were bomb! You get three different salsas, all spicy and delicious! 

We each ordered a Cadillac Margarita but used different tequila (his was Don Julio Anejo and I did Peligroso Blanco. Both were very satisfying.

Now our entrees were extremely delicious as well. I opted for the quesadilla with steak; so yummy!! Perfectly cooked tortilla and well proportioned throughout. My boyfriend got the Fajitas Burrito- Christmas style with rice and calabacitas. Very very good. Only complaint was the rice wasn't fully cooked throughout. 

We will for sure be returning and probably very soon!"}
{"text":"We came here CInco de Mayo weekend and this place was rockin! We ended up eating indoors, away from the festivities because we were looking for a quieter dining experience and let me tell you, the food, service and atmosphere are great!

They have well over 100 different kinds of tequila and a margarita flight where you can try four of your choice, which is actually a great deal.

Here's a tip, get the enchiladas done Christmas style. They mix the red and green chile so you don;t have to pick just one! Your taste buds will thank you (and me!)."}
{"text":"My husband an I were so excited to try this place because of the reviews but they really let us down. We ordered the three generation tacos, the farmers burrito and a green Chile enchilada. Unfortunately, nothing had flavor, absolutely nothing. We usually enjoy chips and salsa but all three salsas they provide are crazy spicy and the chips were stale. We gave this place a two star rating, instead of one, because the servers and hostess were very friendly.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Fake junk Mexican food. Very pretentious menu items. Combo plated boasts pick your own sides, however the combo doesn't include rice or beans. Sooo thank you I'll have what every other Mexican restaurant serves with their entrees and you can call them pick your own sides. 

Asked for a side of tortillas with the bacon wrapped prawns. Got one. 

Salsa was amazing chips were great then my wife's dinner came out, stale chicken taco and a super sub par enchilada. 

I got a side of cheese covered veggies? They sucked, why did I order somthing so odd to accompany my prawns? Because they don't offer refried beans.... Probably because they feel that's played out.... At least it's not cold veggies with cheese. 

Then I asked for my bill to be split, a portion on my corporate card the remaining  balance on my personal card. Well the server blamed my card, the card I've been using this business trip for weeks with no issue. He said it didn't swipe and it charged me but I would see a refund in a few days?  

No apology he said it was rerun and corrected. Thanks for fu***** up my expense report..... 

Don't go here. Or maybe just go to the bar, the tequilla selection looked great. 

THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN CUISINE. It's pretentious fusion nonsense, small portions and gross \"
sides.\""}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago. Being from New Mexico myself, I had to verify that this was indeed \"authentic\". It was pretty damn close! First of all, the waiter (Brad), was very attentive and answered every question we had about the menu. He then brought out the chips and salsa. The red chili used was spicy and had a great smoky taste. Not at all bland, like red chili can be. I ordered the combination plate and got a taco, tamale and enchilada. In great New Mexican fashion, the tamale had amazing flavor. As did the taco and enchilada. My only critique would be that, instead of straight green chili being used as salsa, it would be nice to have actual hot chunky salsa. Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant served up great chicken enchiladas but just ok chicken tacos. I still gave it 4 stars for a great margarita, good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever!! I love the blue corn stacked enchiladas!! You will not regret coming to this restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and will definitely be back. The food, service, drinks and decor were all excellent. I had the Red & Green Chile Plate (Christmas style - both sauces) with pork. The meat was excellent, sauces were amazing, and the rice/beans were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Had chicken and steak fajitas last night.  Jared Twitchell was our food server and the service was excellent and the food was yummo.  Monday Night Football was on, the beers were cold, the Shrimp Diabalito was super yummy, the fajitas are one of my faves and key lime pie for dessert.  Nice evening out!"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience here today and I am long time fan but things have changed so I want to use my voice.  My service was terrible.  The server got so defensive and argumentative when I said my drink was not as ordered...I said light syrup but it as way too sweet.  We almost walked out because he was really rude. I have had this drink many times before but I have not been here in a while.  The ambiance as off...really quiet so it seemed weird.  After all that he was really hasty when he took our order, like he was in such a hurry but we were only one of only two parties there.  He even tapped someone when they didn't answer right away..  And last but not least, my favorite margarita tasted weird, even after the server begrudgingly replaced it like it had spritzer or something in it.  Something made my stomach hurt, I think it was the drink.  The food tasted good as usual thank god."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy here! Front door service to table was excellent! Waiter.... Not good, didn't bring straws even after we asked twice! I had to get them myself! Food temperature was not good-corn Luke warm so was beans and rice. Meat was not seasoned taste bland! Not returning, this was our first and last time! Waiter wasn't attentive, the hostess was and brought us more water. Nope won't be back there."}
{"text":"This was the first time we were there. Started out good.. Chips and 3 different salsa's, they drop on the table and never tell you what they are. It was good. Drinks-Very good. Dinner I had the Farmer's Burrito It was delicious.Waitress asked if I wanted sour cream with it, said yes-was mad to see they charge $1.50 for a spoonful of sour cream.. Really??? My husband had the tree layer enchilada with rice and veggies.. Looked great he said it tasted really good---Until the dreaded strand of long hair was found in his rice.. Told the waitress, and all she kept saying was 'Well the rest tastes good, right?' That put a bit of a damper on the experience. All I kept thinking was where is the hair in my food.."}
{"text":"I just ate lunch at La Ristra and I LOVED it.  I had a Mexican pizza tapa, and WOW.  I know it wasn't chicken, it was either beef or pork, but whatever it was the meat was fantastic, the best part for me.  The service was outstanding, as is the atmosphere.  I can only imagine how much fun La Ristra must be on Fridays and Saturdays with the live music.  I had a great time with my whole experience and look forward to bringing my whole family next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food with outstanding service! Arlen took excellent care of us. I love to be treated like I have a choice. Well, I choose to come here again and again and I will be asking for Arlen! I saw so many dishes I want to try. The chimi-style chicken burrito I had was RIDICULOUS! So delicious,  perfectly seasoned, moist chicken and I got some green sause to take home because I could only eat half. YUMMY!!!! I am stuffed and very happy!"}
{"text":"Don't go to La Ristra expecting run-of-the-mill Mexican food (like what you can find at a hundred other places in and around Phoenix). 

La Ristra is NEW Mexican cuisine, and it's far and away superior to shredded-cheddar-and-refried-beans. 

I visit La Ristra often, and haven't had a bad meal yet.  I'm probably 60% thru the menu. The food is just great, and they are not afraid to put some heat into it, either. But for my taste, it's always perfect; hot, but flavorful, and never too hot. Close, but never over the edge. 

I think my favorite so far is the Farmer's Burrito (with pork) served Christmas Style (red and green sauce). But it's hard to choose because everything is so good. 

Add a great casual bar atmosphere, live music on the weekends (including me!), friendly staff, 100+ tequilas (and a tequila club!) and how can you do better?"}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped shrimp definitely not what is shown in the picture, not very juicy, bacon was cooked well done. 
Beef and Shrimp fajitas: carne asada was bland, shrimp was undercooked 
Green chile burger: meat was well almost like it was cooked over a propane grille and was burnt, didn't taste the green chile, best part was the French fries
Water: was pipe tasting, had to add 2-3 lemon wedges to help with the taste"}
{"text":"Like all the other reviews this place was really good definitely get the Margarita with the 1800 and grand Marnier and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"It's been brought to my attention by multiple people that this New Mexican cuisine, and not Mexican food.  I'm not really sure how that makes a difference with regards to the items that I took issue with in my review, but my apologies for the confusion."}
{"text":"Had multiple times authentic new Mexican food spicy salsa! Had fajitas chicken was great steak was a little fatty. The burritos are great, sometimes are very hot once were cold. The shrimp come with 4 shrimp and they were hard and overcooked but they refunded me every penny for that order. Overall the food is amazing but hey everyone has a bad day. Will order again! Delivery time around 30 minutes all orders have been delivered"}
{"text":"The food is typical for what you would expect if you are familiar with New Mexican style food.  Really nothing stood out beyond that because the food service was stupid slow and came out cold.  The waiter was nice but we rarely saw him and the meal took much to long.  Won't be back solely base on the service.

Btw - our booth was by the patio so every time they open the door myself and 2 small kids got a great whiff of second hand smoke.  Yum."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was not. It was very basic and disappointing. The restaurant was clean and had a decent atmosphere. 

Our order included:
Chips and salsa--good
southwest chopped salad--kind of slimy with little to no flavor.
Pork soup--tasted like it was from a Campbell's soup can
Quesadillas were fine--but you really have to work at screw one up. 
Bean and cheese burrito--I honestly don't know how you can mess this up but my daughter didn't finish it. She said the beans were too runny.

When I asked my husband what he thought about his meal, he said, \"what did I get?\" We just ate there two days ago. 

There may be some delicious things on the menu, but in our entire party of 8 no one left impressed.

For reference, I'm a fan of El Charro and Poco y Mom's in Tucson, along with some hole in the wall places that just kill at making real flavorful Mexican food. So take my opinion with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"First let me say I loved this place. Try it if you haven't already. Just remember its New Mexican food. Not Mexican food. The flavor is very hatch chili. Which means lots of flavor with a bit of a bite. The owner came out to our table to explain the style and types of food they have and was an exceptionally nice guy. He also brought us out our salsas and chips. Three very distinct and different salsas all with fantastic flavor though the green was by far my favorite. The chips are homemade and are very good as well. I had the green asada burro and it was excellent. The steak they use for the asada is some of the best I've ever seen made into it. Very taster with not a single piece of fat or gristle. My wife had the same burro with shrimp instead. She says she highly recommends that as well. Overall this was a great lunch. The waiter was great the owner was great the food was exceptional what more could you want."}
{"text":"Upon parking we see a trailer, empty boxes on the sidewalk, extra booth/chairs outside the bar door and one of those huge linen carts where you toss the dirty laundry.
Entering the restaurant it was kind of dark but the bar was well lit and set for what appeared to be a private party.
The hostess greeted us and ushered us to a table,  in the dark.  Since it was our first time and we do wear readers I asked for a table where there was actually some light that was good enough for us to actually see the menu.  She joked, that's what cell phones are for.  
So she does seat us in one of the many vacant tables with sufficient light and we are promptly greeted by a cheerful waitress.  What was her name?
We discussed Margaritas and after a second trip to the table, and the use of the flashlight on my phone, we were able to make our decision.  A Cadillac for me and the Skinny for hubby. 
They have a $100 Margarita that reads it's served in a medium glass and I guess you get a free tshirt with it.
Sad to say but Zipps Zipparitas have more flavor and alcohol than the drinks we were served.
Chips and salsa were served and we were given the lowdown on the three varieties of salsa. The most generic salsa was bland, the hot red was just chunky and kind of bland, and the green which was supposedly the hottest was lacking depth and really not hot either. I just thought all the salsas lacked distinguishable flavor.
For dinner I decided to try the Chile Relleno BECAUSE I thought it was actually going to contain meat of choice.
Nope, my dish arrived and the meat was put onto the plate and the Chile Relleno was placed on top.  The Chile Colorado was good but greasy and the pepper itself didn't taste like a Hatch Chile.
Everything was sprinkled with cheese. The calabacita veggie blend tasted like they were pulled out of the freezer and just boiled.
The sopapilla was tasty and we all agreed that it was probably the best part of the meal, but sadly nowhere near as delicious as those I've had elsewhere.  Wish Garduno's was still in the East Valley.  
Overall the food was quite bland, lacking distinguishable flavor of each item that went into preparing the various dishes.
I like a salsa where I can actually taste the ingredients that go into making it -tomatoes, jalapenos, onions, garlic, cilantro.  
Gimme something that is HOT AND flavorful.  It is possible to have both together.

I felt the food here was bland, missing the slightest amount of flame from any peppers and lacked flavor.

The tequila selection was interesting but that's not a good enough reason to go back for the food, or a Margarita ftm."}
{"text":"recommended by my daughter-in-law as she lives in that area. Was great food! Great service. the beer was cold. when we went it was a bit slow, as it was between lunch and dinner. they have a lot of tequila's, over 100, so you can taste and test to find your favorite. as it was lunch, we passed on the tequila. will go back. (on negative thing, and i'm just being picky here, the plastic frame that held the daily specials on the table... ours was dirty, really needed a good wipe down)"}
{"text":"So we saw this restaurant previewed on PBS Channel 8's show called \"Check Please\".  The show made it look interesting and good, and all of the commenters that participate in this forum gave the location high marks.   OK, sounds good and we'll give this place a try.

So we went with another couple and all four of us ordered something different. Everyone came away with mixed reviews on the quality of the food.  I personally liked mine which was the blue corn enchiladas, but my wife complained that her three generation taco plate was a little colder than she expected and it was all right, but not over the top. The couple we were with also said the same thing about their meals. So the food is about as good as any other Mexican restaurant and we'll just leave it at that. Nothing over the top.   

Now here's where the whole thing completely breaks down. And that was with service.

The typical round of chips and salsa came out and we made fast work of that especially with four people going after a medium sized portion.   Next, we placed our Margherita orders with one individual and no sooner did we get those placed than here comes another person asking if we were ready to order drinks. Not sure what that was about, or at this point not even sure who was taking our order.

So moving right along, our food orders were taken by the same server who took our drink orders and with no issues. As a compliment,  the food did come out very quickly, which was good. However we did ask for more chips and salsa when our meals were being served and our server said she would get that right away.   She must have completely forgot about that because she never came back with more for quite awhile.  OK, whatever, she's busy I get that. 

So we flagged down one of the young guys running around just doing miscellaneous stuff and lo and behold he was more than happy to bring us another round of chips and salsa and get this, he asks us if we needed our water glasses refilled.   The ladies at our table both commented on the fact that they would rather have him as our server than the one we were stuck with.

And the server assigned to our table never once offered to refill any of our water glasses, and only partially checked to see if we were doing good and if our food was acceptable.   OK, whatever, she's busy I get that.

So the funny part is, and I've never understood this  but the server certainly turns on the charm when it's time ask if we need our checks, and right on cue this individual turns on all the charm and everything else at the end hoping for a better tip.   

In conclusion I won't say the service was horribly bad. What I will say is that it turned an OK meal into a so-so experience.   

One other note, another server who was walking around did come up to our table and asked us if the food was good and if we liked it. Kind of like on a fishing expedition hoping to elicit raving reviews about how fabulous everything was.   All of us commented on the fact the food was good and just left it at that.  It was nothing that really made me say they just knocked it out of the park. Again it was as good as any other restaurant.    But just a word of caution to that person would be, don't go fishing for compliments on something that may not be worth complimenting over.   Be careful for what you ask for.  You may get responses you don't like.

In conclusion, the food's good the service was mediocre at least from this one individual, but I must say the prices were very respectable. Overall I'd encourage you to try this place at least once for the sake of supporting a small business in Arizona."}
{"text":"We went to La Ristra straight from Church on Saturday around 6pm and we had 4 adults and 3 kids. Even though we had to wait for seating, it was not long at all. We were seated and immediately they took our drink order. We ate chips and salsa and put in our orders. We each had something different and ALL of it was amazing as we all tasted what he other had. Stuffed sopapillas, tostadas with beans and ground beef, green chicken enchiladas, chile relleno and sweet sopapillas for dessert. Their beans are whole pinto or black beans - both were cooked perfectly. This IS New Mexican food, not Sonoran Mexican. I can understand if you are expecting the flavors of Sonoran Southwest, you will be disappointed...it is different. This restaurant is spot on in their flavors, sauces and dishes. I am a native Arizonan and my husband is a native New Mexican...we know our Mexican food! Not to mention the owners came to our table to make sure everything was as expected. They were very interactive throughout the evening while we were there. The wait staff, bar and hostess were all very attentive. It is a bit pricey, but for great food and service it was worth every penny. We will be back without the kids to enjoy the bar and review that at a later time....YUM!"}
{"text":"it says authentic mexican and i think we got what it says! really like all our dishes we got chimichanga and ribs. wenalso had flan for dessert and everything tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend said the black beans had no flavor and tasted like they came out of a can and the spanish rice had the texture from being in some sort of heat source for too long. I did not like their red chili as it was somewhat bland.  The ambiance and service was good though."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Now I no longer need to travel back to Albuquerque to get my green chile fix!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 item combination plate with a taco, tamale, and Christmas style chicken enchilada. The tamale was so delicious with the perfect amount of masa and meat, and a nice bit of heat. The enchilada was also very delicious, their chicken was juicy and flavorful. First time in and we weren't disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The food i ordered was delish.  Bacon wrapped shrimp. Everyone else also enjoyed the items also. Except for the soggy cheese crisps.
The biggest problem I had was thier salsas are not up to par. I LOVE salsa and theirs was less than mediocre. The people who recommended this place to me told me the same about the salsas. So if any changes could be made that would be one I'd definitely change.
I also had to go find our server twice."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Thanks to groupon we went off our beaten path and tried this place out (we are seldom west of valvista!). My husband has been on a chile relleno quest so the minute I mentioned restaurant had one on the menu, he took a left and headed straight over. 

First of all, the place is gorgeous on the inside with high ceilings, beautiful decor and nice looking bar. We came at 4 for happy hour and sat in the restaurant area, which was understandably a bit empty that early. Fine with us, we had great attention and speedy service.

We started off with a couple margaritas, salsa, guacamole and something called Papas Bravas. The spicy red and green salsa was on point with great flavor and kick...bout time someone's not afraid of spicy salsa! The guacamole was nice and chunky and those potatoes...wow. Covered in a nice and spicy red chile sauce and cooled down with a sour cream sauce, these were delish! Only thing I thought was throw some chorizo in there and they would be epic. 

We next ordered the hub's relleno. We got the one stuffed with the pork Adovada. I'm used to rellenos battered but this one was grilled and wrapped in a fried egg. I would prefer the batter myself but my husband said this was the best he'd ever had. And actually, with that tender pork inside, I would have to agree. We of course took advantage of the dessert menu and got the fried banana thing...crispy, sweet an drizzled in caramel and chocolate. Can't go wrong with that.

To sum it up, we had a great time. Wonderful food, awesome and attentive service, and we appreciated the owner stopping over to see how we enjoyed it. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very easy to find. The host sat us down quickly and was very friendly. The waiter brought us water (kids cups for my daughters which was a nice touch) and took our orders right after we sat down. My girls split the chicken strips meal. I ordered the Hatch green chile burrito and my hubby got the Mexican pizza. We waited 15 minutes for our food and everything came out hot and delicious. My burrito came with a yummy ancho chile sauce that was slightly spicy but very tasty and a nice addition to the burrito. The Mexican pizza was excellent! The strips of Hatch green chiles were wonderfully flavorful without too much spice. The crust was a flatbread so it was crispy and not too heavy for 1 person, though the portions were shareable. The kids loved the chicken and I liked that it came with beans and rice instead of fries. 5 star service and food! We will be back to La Ristra!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service by Arlen. Cool atmosphere! Chips are great. Carne Asada is delicious and tasteful. Rice is also wonderful."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and we loved it! Great food and service. Pretty authentic tasting. Loved the three salsas and my entree. The sopapillas were soooo good too."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during happy hour with our grandparents and our grandmother is in a wheelchair.  They sat us at a low table, which we requested in the dining room, and when we asked about their happy hour specials, they said they were only available in the bar (only high tops) and outside.  That was a bummer as there really weren't that many seating choices for people in a wheel chair during their happy hour time.  I got a shredded beef quesadilla which really only consisted of cheese and was luke warm when it arrived.  My husband got chicken with avacado and that was smothered in some marinade and wasn't good at all.  We were disappointed in our experience and food and won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place, probably the best mexican (new or otherwise) in Gilbert. First off their salsas are fantastic! We both got drinks, the New Mexico Mule and the La Ristra Margarita, and both were great.

Our entrees were the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, and the Blue Corn Enchiladas with Adovada Pork. Would recommend both!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, this is a great place to get your New Mexico food experience.  We had been to Los Dos Molinos several times on the way back from Dbacks games but this was closer and wanted to try.  Turns out the owners are related.  Great cooking must run in this family because this was an awesome meal. Started with their tasty and not greasy chips with 3 sauces from mild to spicy, all great.   I had the Carnitas which can best be described as a Pork Osso Bucco.  A deliciously slow cooked Pork Shank covered in a flavorful New Mexico style Enchilada sauce served with your choice of black or pinto beans ( I got the black which are vegetarian and delicious ) as well as whole creamy potatoes and rice.  Also comes with a perfectly cooked sopapillas which were great with the honey the waitress brought us.  My wife had the Blue Corn Enchilladas made with the Adovada Pork on the named Blue tortilla with the rice and beans and a little cheese but not drowning in it.  She loved it.  Excellent presentations for both plates.  Excellent service complete with a welcome from the manager.  A definite repeat for us."}
{"text":"We were a pretty big party of about 30 people, 2 super long tables that we seemed to keep adding to.

Glad they had a separate banquet room for large parties.  

The food took awhile to order as well as to come out.  Sometimes service was super and other times delayed and maybe because we were such a large party.  Josh was our main waiter.  

Food was good, but my husband asked for his Carne Asada to be well done and when he got it, it was on the rare side, so we sent it back to be cooked longer.  It was good and at least gives us a place locally that has reasonable Carne Asada for my husband.

My daughter got some blue corn tortilla dish thing, my son a burrito (not sure what kind) and I got some chili rellano thing stuff with their pork specialty.  Food was good.  

No real complaints nor anything super, super outstanding.  We would come back again."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say the service is amazing from the hostess to the amazing waiter Jermey fro Indianan I would highly recommend this place! Jeremy made our dinner great with tons of jokes, definitely coming back. The food was good too Jeremy gave great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Such a great dinner experience. We called ahead to see if there was room in the bar dining area and the hostess made sure to reserve a table for us (even though we did not ask to since it was the car area and it is fist come first served style) so we could see the television to see the football game. This is the place to go for New Mexican food that is SPICY! I got the dinner combination plate with the red beef tamale and chicken flauta and loved every bite, but it was too spicy. I wish I could have had the tamale sauce on the side to control the spice a little better. The spicy aftertaste was overbearing for the rest of the meal. Great flavor but watch out for that New Mexican spice!"}
{"text":"this place was staffed like they had never been open on a Friday night before.  pro tip: it's not a great customer perception when I can clearly see 2-3 servers just standing around and chatting at all times.  at least sneak out back and smoke like any self respecting wage slave.  the food was really bland which was weird because they bill themselves as a New Mexico style restaurant complete with south of the border spicy food.  my wife wants me to quote her here: I hate everything about this place.  sums up the experience pretty well."}
{"text":"Our waiter Charlie was attentive and very polite.  The chips were warm and crispy with three different salsas. Yummy. The plate was delicious! Chicken flauta, pork enchilada, pinto beans and calabacitas."}

Our waiter Matthew was Awesome!! Can't wait to come back.  Oh .., they have a very nice bar anxious to try the drinks next visit"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The chicken dishes were phenomenal. Also, the chips and salsa are just going for happy hour. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because of the  service. Our waiter was really nice but slow, he was the only one working the bar at the time we were there. (happy hour) Overall, great food but be willing to wait."}

{"text":"We decided to try out La Ristra this past week. The restaurant itself is very nice. Love the decor, colors, tables, etc. The location itself is mainly what earned it the 1 star.

Our server was ok. Both my partner and I opted for the 2 entree combo meals. I had the machaca enchilada and green pork tamale. My partner had a taco and enchilada. The chips and salsa were really good, minus the mild salsa. The mild salsa had too much of a tomato taste to it. 

As far as the entrees go, we were not asked if we wanted red or green for the enchiladas. The server did not seem educated on the whole idea of red and green from New Mexico. I had to ask which chile sauce came on my enchilada, as I wanted green.

The actual meal itself was very bland. I don't know if it was an off night...but if not they need to add some flavor. The only thing you tasted from the green sauce was spice. (Which I do like spicy!) The machaca was tough and not tender as it should be. The beans and rice were absolutely flavorless. Our bill was outrageous for just mediocre food. We could've gone somewhere and had a meal full of flavor for how much we paid."}

She is number 1!! She is the reason we came back for more!!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday afternoon with my family of five. We were seated right away (as the place was empty) and given a trio of salsa. Pace yourself because any refills are a charge. Kids meals came out quickly. Corn dog and chicken strips were fine but my daughter's beef taco was not edible. Not only was the meat completely void of taste but the shell was stale. We got chicken nachos for the table. Not sure what the other food tasted like because the combo of oil, dried out chicken, and canned chilies, my stomach hurt too bad to eat anything else. My husband did seem pleased with his carne asada grill entree. 

The restaurant layout was fine and the waiter was nice but I would not return."}
{"text":"I can't stress enough how GREAT the food and service here is.  John (the owner ) served us personally.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about this restaurant at first. I hadn't heard much about it before going for the first time. After spending an evening dining here I am surprised I haven't heard more about this restaurant. First off the staff because they were incredible. We had the same waiter both times we have come here. He was very friendly and personable. He always made sure we were stocked up on soda as well as chips and salsa. We spoke with the owner for literally about 30 minutes about how he wants to make this restaurant great. He spoke about how the customer is always right and how he wanted to make sure everyone is always happy with service. He is open to feedback and encourages it. When you receive chips and salsa they give you three salsas which are all unique. The food came out timely and was delicious. The portions were perfect. You definitely get what you pay for. They have a tequila club where you can try 100s of different types of shots and give you your own glass that you can grab every time you come in. The bar is pretty big. Both the bar and restaurant are aesthetically pleasing.  I highly recommend giving this restaurant a shot."}
{"text":"We have been going to LaRistra once a week since they opened their doors. Service is outstanding, food is beyond compare, and over 100 brands of Tequila. What else can you ask for. House margarita is the best on the valley.  The owners are very personable and the staff very friendly.  If going on a Friday night, make reservations. They are usually packed between 5 and about 8:30 ish. Also, try Brunch on Sunday with Bloody Mary and mimosa specials."}
{"text":"I recently ate at La Ristra restaurant and arrived after 7pm. The staff was very slow and seemed to be disorganized to take my take my order, almost 15 minutes and much longer to serve me. I was not impressed with the dark and gloomy atmosphere it was hard to read the menu and to see my food, and it seemed the staff reflected it. The management needs to add more lighting and give it an uplifting experience."}
{"text":"Yum! First time in tonight. Awesome salsa, great tortillas and yummy margaritas! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight, with our son who had been here once before. He couldn't stop talking about it. Being Friday night, we had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated. I ordered the traditional burrito w/ green chile pork and asked for it Christmas style. My wife ordered Socorro's chicken, our son had the green chile plate and his wife had a traditional burrito \"chimi\" style. We all enjoyed the food and will be going back. The service was good, but not exceptional. The decor is pretty nice, too."}
{"text":"I hate leaving negative reviews, literally hate it. The service was great! But the food was bland, and just not good. I'm honestly sad, because I not only wasted $30 on food I didn't even eat after trying, but I'm from NM, and was looking forward to some authentic NN food."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is SPICY hot and the sopapillas are to die for. Love it every time we go!"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular spots and we love it. If you you dig southwestern food with kick, you'll get that here. The stacked blue enchiladas are great. Margaritas are great.

I would have given five stars, but tonight was not like them at all. All previous times we've been here, the service has been quick and the staff has been incredibly friendly. Tonight, however, we were at our table for 35 minutes with no food. When it came out, it was wrong. But within a minute or so, we had the right dishes.

Overall, the food is fantastic. If you're a tequila need, they've got a great selection and you can even have a glass stored there for next time (and the next and the next). We like this place. Hopefully tonight was a fluke, because all other times have been great."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant for dinner. The food tasted great and the orations were large. Live music, not too loud. Service was good."}
{"text":"Ask for Chris! He's the best server here. Very friendly and good! You won't be disappointed with the food either. Delicious! The guacamole and fajitas are bomb!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is Great!!! I'm not one that likes Mexican Restaurants cause they are never authentic. But this place is Awesome!!!!! Have to come here!!! I will be a regular here. And their prices are really reasonable!!! Ask for Angel!! She is awesome should you get her!!! Thanks Angel!! We will see you again!!"}
{"text":"Went here based upon reviews. I was extremely satisfied with the food. The reviews were right on. The three salsa were very good and unique. With the choices you couldn't go wrong with one salsa. All were delicious. The ceviche was so good! The only thing was there were a lot of jalapeños in it. The entree we split the blue corn enchiladas! They were recommended and we're so dang good. The dish was unique with the blue corn tortillas and the egg on top. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! You won't be disappointed. Great atmosphere and delicious food"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best we have had since living in Albuquerque 20 + years ago!!! Can't wait to bring our friends!!!! Service was great. Very friendly and new the menu well."}
{"text":"We have now eaten here 4 times, the first time was when they first opened and everything was so spicy and got I could not eat it. BUT I can say I am so glad that we gave it a second try. They have got the green corn tamales down to a science. Best I have had in the 20 years I have lived in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is a good little place to eat when you're craving some of that home style food from New Mexico. They have good heat chile dishes and their salsa is decent. Try the margarita flight to see what flavor you like best."}
{"text":"We're new in town and my husband and I tried this place first.  Tonight's visit certainty won't be the last.  From start to finish, this place was awesome!  Our waiter Brad was more than on top of things, and the food was to die for! The only problem was that we didn't have enough room in our satisfied stomachs to eat it all.  We're looking forward to our leftovers and next visit!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place ever!  I had Socorro chicken, needed seasonings, nothing to it! Their salsas were bad also!  Service was even poor."}
{"text":"Awesome New Mexican food!  A must try if you have not been.  I ordered an amazing burrito last time I was there.  Flavor was amazing.  We have ordered several different items and all have been very good.  We were not impressed by any of the shrimp dishes, but all the meat we have tried had great flavor.  I didn't drink but they do have 150 different tequilas, I am sure that is dangerous!"}
{"text":"Tried the blue corn enchilada and the previous reviews were right-really awesome!  The pork was very tender and the Christmas sauce was a good selection.  For sides, black beans and a vegetable melody that was very good.  Also had the cheese crisp - very tasty :)  happy hour every day 2-6 bar or patio so a good deal"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to try out the digs before it was all finished and found it to be a pretty sweet find!  The chips and salsa were tasty with bland to spicy choices (but the initial serving size on the salsa was pretty lame... Ok, they did willingly return several times to give us more!!  Yeah!!)  You could tell the learning curve was just kicking in, but in spite of that, the servers were pleasant, engaged and willing to go that extra mile to please!  MARGARITAS are AWESOME!!  BEST in GILBERT BY FAR!! We'll be back to see how things trend for sure!! The Traditional Burrito Plate was tasty with the adovada pork and Christmas style enchilada sauces.  The Southwest Chopped Salad was tasty once my wife realized to use the spicy salsa as the dressing!!  Fair serving sizes meant nothing to pack up to take home but also no room for dessert! :)  Big Hatch Chili shin dig this weekend so we're heading out to check it out and savor some sweet smells and cool tastes!!"}
{"text":"Service and food was outstanding. Margaritas were some of the best I ever had. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Being from New Mexico I have very high expectations and they were mostly met."}
{"text":"My husband and I are transplants from NM and having grown up on the finest New Mexican food, we both agree that this is the best place to get a taste of home!! We go back with family and visitors all the time, and never a let down!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and decent portions. Service was friendly and attentive.We were there from one of their email invites for national margarita day. The only disappointment were the margaritas. They came in plastic cups and were pretty small.  I asked why no glass when we were in at the bar and were told they are busy and some people get plastic. Kind of lame.
We have been here before and like the New Mexico flavors"}
{"text":"AWESOME.  I went here for lunch, and LOVED the Blue Corn Enchiladas with the shredded beef.  Not your average enchiladas, the blue corn tortillas were stacked and layered with the beef, cheese, and a red sauce that was perfect.  The fried egg on top was surprisingly good, really added to flavor.  My favorite part was the sopapilla- like a light pillow of deliciousness, drizzled with honey.  Oh, the housemade salsa to start with was also amazing.  Waitress was sweet and attentive, and I felt very welcomed, as the owner even stopped by to see how things were going.  I will definitely be back, there were a ton of other things on the menu that I want to try next!"}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars however when I order extra sourcream and guacamole I don't expect to be charged 5.00 extrA bucks, especially since it's literally a dollop not a half of a cup.disappointing there.our server arnel was great! And while seated outside they put my packer game on.that was a plus.pribably wont return but if I did by some chance I would've order the extra condiments."}
{"text":"This was my first time at La Ristra and I was not impressed. To start my experience, the hostess suggested a bar seat- we had a four year old with us and my friend was pregnant.  I saw no booths and only high top tables as I looked into the empty bar area and assuming she saw the look on my face, she then took us to the restaurant side. There were only two occupied tables in this area, with one group eating their meal.  My first impression of the menu was that it was a little pricey for regular entrees but never having eaten here this didn't put me off as I will pay good money for quality Mexican food. We were brought chips and salsa fairly quickly. The salsas were just ok and they were a very small portion.  We were offered a small side of queso for free which tasted good. I ordered a shredded beef taco salad and my friend ordered the chicken southwestern salad and a kids quesadilla meal.  It took nearly an hour to get our food. Yes, an hour for salads, with only one table ahead of us to order. What I assumed was a manager came by to ask us how our food was before we had even been served any. The kids meal was brought first with a soggy, greasy tortilla with ice cold beans and rice- literally the cheese did not melt on the beans. Very evident that quesadilla was microwaved or left to die under the heat lamp. The southwestern salad was ordered with beans on the side. Came with beans on the salad and had to be sent back. When a new one reappeared quickly, my friend found the bottom of her bowl full of water- presumably from the lettuce. She decided not to send it back a second time and instead asked the waiter for a spoon and she removed the water herself with the spoon. My salad was just ok, no real flavor with the beef, although there was a good portion of it. Both salads consisted of shredded iceberg lettuce on the bottom with field greens on the top. First of all it was strange, and seemed an obvious money saving \"trick\" for the restaurant.  Iceberg alone was perfectly fine for the taco salad and romaine would have been a better bet on the other salad- my opinion- trying to fancy it up with field greens just seemed odd. For two salads, a kids meal and two fountain drinks this meal was just over $30. Ridiculous.  Surprised by other reviews that this place owned by Los Dos Molinos family. Not on par  at all. This may be an ok place for happy hour if you are drinking but not a place I would visit again.  As a side note, I realize  the few reviews I have made here are not positive reviews. I tend to contact management immediately when I have a great experience while dining out."}
{"text":"This is certainly one of the best \"neighborhood\" bars in Gilbert. Their tequila selection is second to none, have a nice selection of draft beers and make a killer margarita from fresh ingredients. Recently, the quality of the music on Friday night has increased dramatically with the likes of Ian Eric and Holly Kirsten. In addition, La Ristra have hired several new people for their wait-staff - I am particularly impressed with Alissa. Having someone who remembers you from week to week goes a long way towards making a neighborhood bar really feel like part of the neighborhood.

In addition to the bar scene, they also have a very nice dinner room - however, their great selection of New Mexican Cuisine is also available in the bar area. 

La Ristra remains our go-to place for Friday night."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it here, had a fun family outing, celebrating birthdays and such. Our waiter was on top of everything, brought the birthday duo their ice cream and didn't bring the whole service crew along...sigh of relief. The food was unique...in a good way. I'm used to the same old drab fare that my hometown has to offer which everyone gloats about BUT this was a pleasant change. I had the fajita burrito with Christmas sauce, highly recommended. The portions are huge and you will leave satisfied. I didn't explore the drink menu much but I did get a 32oz mug of beer which many restaurants don't do. Nice neighborhood and good atmosphere save for the country music, I'm normally a fan of but seemed out of its element. Anyways...check it out!!"}
{"text":"Over priced, food just isn't that good, my steak fajitas we burnt, server wasn't friendly, wouldn't go back or recommend anyone to go there. 3 different salsas to pick from and the mild one was the only one that had any flavor and was still terrible."}
{"text":"La Ristra is perfect place for a birthday celebrations. We enjoyed a red chili chimichanga, green chili burger, red chili stuffed sopapilla, and a quesadilla! Service was great! John, the owner, welcomed us and the staff sang happy birthday to our 17 year old grandson. We tried the new cinnamon apple sopapilla! Wow! They are delicious!"}
{"text":"Menu had hardley anything to choose from. Waiter seemed to be very knowledgablee but after order was taken we really didnt see him much. Food was very bland and not good tacos were suppose to come on flour tortillas but came on corn instead. Not happy at all and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Had a great evening with the ladies! The food was fantastic! I had the 3 Generations Tacos, they were amazing and we had excellent service from Bradley. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Food was great service was excellent and all I have to say is churro Bowl!!  The atmosphere was great we sat in the bar and they had live music. Such a fun place. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"After hesitantly visiting this establishment the first time, and then on numerous occasions with family, and even large groups of friends, I felt it was high time I post a review. First off, THIS IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD! If you want simple tacos and runny guacamole, head down the road to one of your no name taco stands. This is New Mexican food, as in, authentic food from NEW MEXICO! Yes, that means real New Mexico food with real hatch chili's! They do not compare, and to do so is unreasonable. If you're looking to judge this place on standard Mexican street tacos, or a bland quesadilla, it's not that kind of place. But, if you want some tacos like you've never experienced before....this is it.Try a Chili Colorado, or a Pork Adovada taco, and you'll see, it is  two very different cuisines. Better yet, expand your horizons and try the Blue Corn Enchiladas....they'll change your mind for sure! Everything about this place, from the owners, to the food, to the perfect service we've ALWAYS received, screams 5 STARS! To the owners J&A, you're doing one hell of a job! Thank you, and ALL of your staff for making each and every visit as awesome as possible!"}
{"text":"- The red posole is pretty good.  Needs to be thicker and more stew-like, but great flavor.  The red chiles are the perfect touch.

- The carnitas were juicy, but could be a little saltier.

- The chicken tacos were pretty bland.

- The shredded beef tacos were excellent.  Lots of flavor and very tender.

- The red and green salsas both had some pop and were great with both chips and our mains."}
{"text":"I had dinner here Sunday night with family and it was AMAZING. 

It was late around 8pm and it wasn't very busy in the restaurant which was nice. We sat and had prompt chips/salsa and ordered some guacamole. The guacamole was wonderful and each of the salsas were very tasty. 

My mom ordered cheese blue corn enchiladas, husband ordered the New Mexican burrito, dad ordered the green chili stew and I had stuffed sopapillas. Every one loved their food. Each plate was equally tasty and the beans and rice were so great. 

I would definitely compare this food to Dicks Hideaway or Richardson's in Phoenix. I loved this restaurant. The food was so good, the service was awesome and it is close to my house. I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place and not disappointed.  We loved the atmosphere and remodel they've done.  Very comfortable and welcoming.  We sat at the high tables, which we enjoy, but didn't feel like we were in the bar. 

The salsas were good and spicy too, but not too hot.  We each tried something different and all 3 dishes were quite different and all tasty. The blue corn enchiladas with the Christmas style as they call it (both red and green sauce) was the fav at our table. 

We'll definitely be back for more food,  margs and Negro Modelo in tap!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best green chili sauce I have ever had! If you like spicy, please get this sauce on anything you order. You will not be disappointed. It's super spicy and full of flavor. I had a shrimp, green chili burrito with cheese and it was heaven. A great patio area and ladies night on Thursdays which gives you happy hour all night! Sorry men! Happy hour is 3 to 6 PM. Please come try this place! Full of flavor :-) Angel was the best waitress ever!"}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here! The service is awesome! The chips and salsa are amazing! The food is great and they have great drinks! We love the live music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.  All the food i ordered was overly spicy... I love spicy food but this was just spicy to a point of unenjoyable. Chicken was very bland but the beef was actually decent - probably the only positive thing of my experience. Also, the price was NOT WORTH the portion.  I'm not sure if they skimped on it since I was a take-out order, but I was shocked at how little food I got."}
{"text":"the food is excellent. we've been a few times now and nothing has been less than 4 stars on it's own. i like that they can recommend items when in doubt, but i'd like to see a more extensive drink menu that reflects the homage to tequila they have going. let me be clear, you can enjoy so many varieties of tequila that you will think you died and went to tequila heaven. i just think that for the times that i don't want the shot hitting all at once, a few more drinks would be great to pick."}
{"text":"Tough week equals pumpkin spice margarita at La Ristra.  
Joe is a fantastic server.  My water glass was always full, and my margarita was amazing"}
{"text":"Such a great place for brunch, lunch or dinner. The tequila here is off the charts! The bartenders are friendly, educated about the menu and all of the tequila they offer. The spicy mango margarita is my favorite. 
The food is well spiced, fresh ingredients, many different types of salsa and the best sopapillas around. 
Angel, Caleb, Chris, Becca, so many great people there I can't even name them all. Taco Tuesday is the day to go. Always a new taco offered and they're all amazing. Great selection of sports on the TVs in the bar and they're everywhere.
 John the owner comes by every table to check in and say hello even if you're new to the place. 
My family just loves the ambiance, food and people here. If you come out, make sure to try a signature margarita, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's a really nice space, big and open. Plenty of options for seating. They have a really nice variety of foods as well. I brought my parents here when they were in town from out of state because my father is a spicy food aficionado and that is kind of there specialty with lots of hot peppers and spicy salsas. 

He said his food was really good, loved the salsas and options for the food. My mother got a seafood dish that she also really liked. 

I had the carne asada and this is where I knocked off a star. On the menu they put little chili emoji's next to the dishes with hot salsa on them and what not. I ordered the carne asada specifically because it didn't have one of those emoji's because I am not a big spicy food person. When my food came out, there was a large portion of salsa over my carne asada and it turned out to be there hottest salsa so effectively my carne asada was ruined because it was drenched in the stuff. Everything else on the plate was delicious but, I wasn't warned about the heat of the dish by the server or on the menu which seems like a pretty large flaw. 

Still would definitely reccomend, just make sure you specificy with the wait staff."}
{"text":"Food is visually pleasing, beyond that I can't say too much good.  The food is extremely bland, no taste what so ever. I have no idea how they get any reviews above 2 stars, I give the taste a 1 star, but the presentation a 4.  The meats taste like they are boiled with no spices at all, the beans and rice are totally blah.  The cheese enchilada and cheese crisp are quite good but again the Hatch chilies are not spicy at all, how does that happen? The chips are cold, they have 3 salsas, the mild is full of corn and horrible , the red is okay and a bit spicy, the green is pretty good and has a bite to it. Just not enough good to make us want to go back ."}
{"text":"2 words, Amazing Mexican!!! Ask for Tommy \"superman\" the server! He definitely made our experience worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Our server Jackie was outstanding. We asked for a spicier salsa and they made us one with roasted habaneros. It was wonderful. The fish tacos were the best. Margaritas perfection. The apple pie dessert was beyond belief. On a scale of 1 to 5 this is a 10."}
{"text":"The food was flavorful and the staff worked as a team to make sure we received great service."}
{"text":"Love at first bite! I have a feeling this will be our go to restaurant for tasty New Mexican style food. It was mine and my boyfriend's first time and we were definitely blown away by our first impression. Our friendly waiter Tommy was very informative about his favorites on the menu and other popular items. The owner herself actually took the time to welcome us to her restaurant. She filled us in on their HH Mon-Fri 2-6 and all their great specials. Our entrees were very much enjoyed I got their trio combo with enchiladas and a tostada and my boyfriend got their Socorros grilled chicken and avocado. Their Prices were very reasonable. If you like real New Mexican style eating with hatch green Chile then surely get a spicy KICK out of this place. We will be back for seconds"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken quesadilla & husband ordered the Chile Relleno with Adobada plate. His first bite of the Chile Relleno tasted like grease but he thought maybe it was just the crust. He took a second bite and it was just as bad. In disbelief he asked me to try it. I thought it tasted like rancid grease, and it made my stomach turn. I had to spit it out.  When the waiter came by we told him of the problem & he did offer to make something else which we politely declined since now my husband wasn't feeling well. Was very suprised to see that the chile relleno plate was still on our ticket. Left feeling ill and will not be returning"}
{"text":"I really enjoy New Mexico cuisine. This restaurant has excellent food and many drink choices. We had a nice waiter named Brad ( however he forgot limes twice - oops) 
If you haven't tried this restaurant you are missing a great part of Gilbert. Sonoran style is good but New Mexico style is GREAT! Take it from a lifelong Arizonian!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Carne adovada blue corn enchiladas were perfect... Just the right amount of heat.  Paired with a prickly pair margarita on the rocks out on the patio with Matt as your server and you have the recipe for an outstanding Friday night."}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with New Mexican food; be warned: it is pretty darn hot! Its very good at La Ristra though and somewhat more high brow than some I've tried. The portions are a little large for me partly because I drink a gallon of tea to douse the heat. Its a little expensive in my opinion but the service makes it worth the extra few dollars."}
{"text":"I've had the adovada ribs, the blue corn enchiladas, and the adovada plate. All were excellent, but the ribs might become my staple there. It's New Mexican food, so it tends to be on the spicy side, but here the chili is not overpowering (it actually could be a smidge hotter in my opinion.)
This is turning into our go-to Mexican restaurant in Gilbert. We've been there several times, and both the food and service are always great."}
{"text":"I had the traditional carne adovado burro with green sauce.  I love spicy food, and it fit the bill!    The canned Mexican music could be turned down a couple of notches - it was a little hard to communicate.  Our server was very attentive.  Afterwards, we had a drink in the bar and enjoyed the live music.  Very cozy, comfortable neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place but after eating there I will just say it is OK.  This dining experience was forgettable.   Arrived and they had employees smoking on the back dock with a bunch of random equipment strewn out the door.  You have to drive around the back to get to the entrance so it is the 1st thing you see as you park.  The restaurant has typical New Mexican decor and they played country music.  Food was just Ok.   The place had no energy and felt like it had no soul."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  The only place that beats it is it's older brother Los Dos Molinos.  I had the blue corn enchilada stack which was absolutely supreme with the adovada.  The egg on top and pintos made this dish complete.  Deep fried ice cream to finish was OK.  Staff friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Really amazing restaurant! The staff here is always attentive, up-beat and makes sure we are well taken care of. I haven't had a bad experience yet and I don't think they will let me down. If I don't go in, I'll order from door dash and the food is always fresh as if I were sitting in the restaurant. I would highly recommend La Ristra's to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"The food has been really good our last two visits and the margaritas are delicious.  Tonight they have a Dracula margarita with dry ice. Green Chile & black bean dip with chorizo was excellent.  Live music on the weekends .  Nice little hangout place."}
{"text":"Just went in to celebrate National Margarita Day.  15 to 20 minute wait even though there were open tables in the restaurant area.
We put our name in and asked for first available.  Wanted to make sure that the specials that were advertised by their VIP texts and the flyer hanging on the front door were good in both the restaurant and in the bar so we asked.  The receptionist who was sitting by the door told us that the margarita specials were good but they weren't serving the taco specials any more.  There were no time limits on the text for when the tsco deal ended.  We decided to leave because the taco special was over.  Not good advertising or planning on La Ristra's part. Take down your flyer or have the receptionist tell people when they come in. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"11-2-17 A return trip to La Ristra was rewarded with not only excellent food but wonderful service as well.  I took my brother who was \"visiting\" from Scottsdale to La Ristra for his birthday along with another friend.  Honestly, I was a bit apprehensive about returning after the disappointing experience my family and I had as mentioned previously.  Upon receiving a follow up response and a return invitation incentive from the owner, John G, I decided to give La Ristra another chance.  Let me begin by saying that this return visit could be considered a study in contrasts, like night and day.  Not only were we warmly welcomed by the host when entering the restaurant, but upon sitting at the bar we were greeted with genuine sincereity by Rebecca.  She immediately took our drink order and brought warm chips and salsa, which we couldn't stop eating so she kept them coming.  Not only was she very attentive, she was super friendly!  Upon receiving our order, she kept the warm sopapillas coming including a bottle of honey, yum! I had mentioned to her earlier that it was my brothers birthday and upon finishing our meals, she brought out a dish of deep fried ice cream with a lit candle!  What a nice touch!  All in all this was a fun visit with delicious food we all enjoyed and it was topped off with Rebecca and all her awesomeness!  I want to mention how much I really appreciate John's initial follow up/invitation to return.  This puts a personal touch on how he runs his business and says a lot about how much he values his customers.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here for the first time and the unusual NM food was excellent (we both had wraps). Service was friendly and prompt and I can't think of anything that should/could have been better. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"We love this place! Stacked enchiladas, cheese crisp, shredded beef tacos, etc. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing green chili!  I loved the red too but prefer the green.  Rice and beans (either pinto or black) both fantastic!  Rice is YUMMMMM!  The chili plate didn't come with a tortilla so I really did miss that, but otherwise, fabulous!  The chips and salsa were super good!  I did prefer the red salsa over the green.  I want to try the enchiladas the next time I visit because I think that red sauce is going to make the best enchilada ever!! I will be back for sure!   YUMMMMY!!"}
{"text":"Great 3 salsa options, and likely the best cheese crisp in town. Have eaten here several times and mostly good service and food. BUT, I'm not sure how I ended up spending $50 for a lunch for 2 with no drinks. That's tuff to get over and has left me not wanting to return."}
{"text":"Such a great find!  Great happy hour.  Loved the ceviche and the 3 generation tacos.  Plus great service too.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Gotta drop it a star. Took some friends here since we really liked it The first time.

Asked the waitress what was really good so I could try something else and she recommended the green chili cheeseburger. It sucked and was very small.

Stick to the Adobada enchiladas. We will probably go back for those."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. If they would use good ingredients for their food they would be so much better, but everything tastes like it comes from a can. You get three salsas, and chips to start out. The chips were great, but the salsa is mediocre. The mild one is straight up nasty, but my husband seemed to enjoy it. The medium salsa wasn't that bad, and the hot was too hot for me. I ordered a grilled chicken chimichanga, and it was sub par. The seasoning was off, but everything else was okay. It was super greasy, and it made my stomach hurt afterwards. The fried ice cream was good-ish. Again, the food just needs better seasoning, and it would be good. Our waiter was awesome, and efficient. The atmosphere is okay- I would compare it to Serranos. We will not go here again. My husband can make better Mexican food."}
{"text":"I would say this is 5 stars for the simple fact you can order online through Yelp and have Mexican food delivered to your door! 4 star food with great service and it's better than the usual pizza and wings we get tired of. Fairly fast delivery too! Will definitely do it again."}
{"text":"This was our very first time coming here. I must say, we loved it! Amazing food great service the taste reminds me of my moms cooking! Definitely will be making this our new favorite stops."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal and staff was really nice. I see poor reviews against them because it took a while to get service. If you're in a rush then why are you dining out? If you took out those dumb reviews this place would have 5 stars."}
{"text":"Easy and simple review for La Ristra. Service was fine but the food was very very very average. There are a lot better options. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars on yelp."}
{"text":"My hubby and the in-laws and I decided to track down some yummy Mexican food.  We were moderately successful. The good: the food. I'm can't take that away from them, the food was delicious all the way around.  The cons: the service!
We had a waiter who was not very experienced.  He messed up two of our orders and was continually reaching over our food to reach plates, glasses, etc instead of walking around.  This would have been totally forgiveable.  Except... instead of telling us the dining room closed at a certain time (the restaurant is listed as being open until midnight) the staff simply cleaned up around us as we were eating.  I got to finish my meal with the pungent smell of cleaner instead of fresh salsa.  It was also super annoying that they decided to mop the floor to the only exit (making the walk to the door quite treacherous) and start cleaning the bathrooms so that they couldn't be used.  I would have been happy to eat elsewhere if we had been informed that they were getting ready to close the dining room.  We finished our meal and left  at 9:45pm on a Saturday.  It's a shame because the food was good but with such disappointing service, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This a good restaurant to go service is fast nice people I love the chips and salsa is good ambient."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some place new so hubby picked this place. We started with the shrimp and fish ceviche. I wish there was more fish and shrimp but the flavor was tasty. Then for entrees, he got the traditional burro with carne adovada and I got the chile relleno with shrimp. The meat in his burro was so tender and had good flavor and my entree was delicious! A good amount of shrimp inside and a perfect cheese ratio and some spice. Our server was great! Wish I remembered his name. But very nice guy. 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Was very good overall.  I had the House Burrito Chimichanga style and my wife had the enchiladas, both dishes were excellent, good amount of spice but not crazy hot.  Salsas were good as well.  We had a couple sangritas which was a margarita, house made sangria combo which were also good.  My only complaint was that the meat could have used a touch more salt.  We will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"We were set on trying a New Mexican establishment and Yelp lead us to La Ristra's.  I honestly was not impressed this evening with the type of hosting service provided and taste of food.  Our waiter, Tommy and the presentation of food was great.  We were greeted upon walking in and instantly fell off the radar as the guy found that talking to another employee was more important than the customer.  Another employee kindly approached us asking if we've been helped, my reply \"I believe so.\"  He then asked the host if he could seat us and gave him directions were to seat us.  Strange, how we were the customers and we were not priority to begin with.  We were greeted immediately by our waiter, Tommy.  He provided great service with the exception of our request of bean dip.  We were served an appetizer ($5) that consisted of a cheese crisp with pinto bean dip.  Hmmmmm.....not exactly what I was aiming for.  Maybe explain to customers what La Ristra's bean dip is???  Our meals had shredded beef and zero flavor.  It was dry, not juicy; this is very important when preparing shredded beef.  However, we were happy about the amount of meat that is stuffed into the tacos and flautas.  It was a very generous amount compared to some other Mexican restaurants.  We proceeded to ask for the banana-rito dessert and it was sold out at 7pm.  Too many red flags to go back so we can at least say we tried it and will most likely NOT be back.  Oh and not to mention, a server coming out the kitchen with food said, Oh SH*T!  Yes, we heard that:-("}
{"text":"It was okay. I like a shredded beef taco, and I found this one to be bland. It came with beans and I had vegetables too. Beans were ok. Vegetables were better. They had some jalapeños and a bit of heat that kept it interesting, but overall just fair. 

The dining area seemed to be cooled with an evap cooler. It was not comfortable. Walked out and the waiting area felt much cooler."}
{"text":"The food was really good when we came in for lunch as a team. I had the blue corn enchiladas and they were so good, I would come back just for those again. 

One note is the squash side is SO spicy. Both my coworker and I basically gagged and instantly had our eyes well up with tears after one bite. If you like spicy stuff that's a good choice but I was too much of a baby to eat it. It would have been nice for some warning before I ordered it from the wait staff."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Our server was really nice but we weren't big fans of the food and we were really disappointed in the salsa."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks!! Very authentic New Mexican food. Spicy and delicious!!! Drinks were great!! Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"We recently tried this place, the food was pretty good if you can handle spicy, it tasted very authentic. We will def come back! The people were friendly, the only reason I'm rating this a 4 is because I feel the service was a little slow, I think they could manage the servers schedules a little better, as far as having more help on busy nights. Our server was serving the whole dining section by his self and I could tell was a little overwhelmed with how busy it was."}
{"text":"Green Chile stew is amazing!!!Alex is a great bar server..., We always eat in the bar :-)"}
{"text":"Let me first begin with saying I really did enjoy their chips and their bean dip. Those, unfortunately were the highlights of our dinner. I will agree, they do have a great selection of Tequilas. The decor is nice and while you wait and eat you can watch sports on their flat screens and/or sit and listen to non-stop country music.  But as far as this place being worthy of a five star rating, definitely not. 

When my husband, child, and I went in there were, maybe, 3 other tables seated and a couple of people at the bar. So a little empty for 5pm, but then again it was on a Wednesday. About 15-20 minutes into being seated our orders were finally taken for our entrees and our appetizers. 

During our wait, we are brought out their salsa trio - chile verde, mild chunky, and red blended chile. The red blended and salsa verde were pretty tasty and had a nice kick to them. But the chunky salsa tasted as if they opened a can of stewed tomatoes and added cilantro to it. No flavor at all and probably the worse salsa I have had yet. 

The guacamole was brought out very quickly and was just ok. It could have used additional seasoning. The bean dip took 15 more minutes or so to come out, and we had to remind our server about it. 

As we are waiting 4 more parties had been seated around us, a couple after our orders had been taken. 30 minutes pass, 45 minutes pass ...no food. While waiting we noticed the other tables, all with larger parties than ours, were receiving their food...an hour into putting in our order and still no food. Our server finally comes by and says it will be out soon. Nearly 15 minutes later, our food finally comes out. We had ordered the sopapillas, beef fajitas, and a corndog for our child...which took over an hour to cook apparently. 

By this time we have had our fill of chips, coke and iced tea and are ready to enjoy this highly rated food. The Rice - dry. Beans - ok but needed a tad more salt. Fajitas - veggies over-salted and meat was not good quality. The beef tasted like it was stewed and just not very tasty unless coated in sour cream. My husband said their red chile sauce was ok, but nothing to rave about. In the end, I ended up sticking to the beans and loading up on my iced tea and more chips. 

Now, I am notorious for brining home my left overs, even if the food was just ok. I brought nothing home and left nearly a full plate fajitas. We are major foodies and have been known to travel long distances for good food. If you want authenticity, go to Comedor Guadalajara. If you want good authentic \"New Mexico\" Cuisine, go to La Parilla Suiza. These are places that, even if they have a high ticket time, the food is well worth it. 

Just because you cook everything in green chiles, does not make it good  or classify it as New Mexico Cuisine. 

We will definitely not be going back to La Ristra"}
{"text":"I am 5 months pregnant and all I have been craving has been cheesy, spicy, New Mexican enchiladas. We came here on a whim because our other favorite New Mexican place is in Central Phoenix. Their food was ok, but not the greatest. I ordered their blue corn chicken enchiladas, christmas style. I felt like the plate was missing more sauce. I had to keep scraping the corners to get the chili taste on my enchiladas. The sopapilla that came with the dish was nothing memorable. 
Unfortunately, we will not be coming back to this place. I really wanted to like it. Bummer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ever. Moved here 4 years ago and this is truly authentic. Moved from El Paso-Las Cruces area and have searched for a few years now for the red Sauce, pinto beans, AND SOPAPILLAS. Prices were good....service was top notch. Every employee spoke to us, but our waiter/server, Ivan, was the best we've encountered in the Valley.  Superb service without having to ask for a thing. He was on top of this game with sincerity and was engaged with every table of customers as they were family. We'll ask for him every visit. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Very dirty! My husbands burrito had cheese that never melted that was mixed in with cold meat. Silverware had food on it that they had wrapped in their napkins. Sugar packs were hard from something spilling on it and being left in basket. Health department will be contacted!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last Friday night. We got there very late, about 20 minutes before close. This makes me extremely nervous, but both the service and the food were exception. My wife never likes Mexican food and she loved this place. The stacked enchiladas are just awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I eat there a couple times a month and I have never been let down. The owner is great and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Since we are from Albuquerque we really wanted to like the food at La Ristra, but alas as most Az restaurants that advertise \"New Mexican food\" it just wasn't up to the standards of what we are use to in NM. I ordered tacos with ground beef, I got shredded beef, 2 of my grandchildren ask for them to hold the garnishment on their plates, (lettuce & tomatoes) they still received it. However my wife didn't get any on her plate! We pointed this out to the waiter and he comped the soft drinks. Salsa was good and hot, but the food just wasn't that good, so we will still make our quarterly trip to Albuq to get our fix of good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Being from Southern California, I expected the Mexican food in AZ to be just as good. Let me tell you, it's a whole different thing. This place was okay. The margaritas were good, but really tasted watery towards the end. They bring you 3 salsas with the chips, those were really good. My wife got the carne asada, and I got the fajitas (chicken and carne asada), well I'm pretty sure it was a flank steak. I've never had carne asada like that before. The chicken tasted good, and their atmosphere was nice. Not a bad place, but not really what I'm looking for in a sit down Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I think New Mexican food is amazing in so many ways. I got hooked when I used to go visit the BFF in NM. 

This place is definitely on point w/ that! This place is really close to my house and I always pass it so my friend and I decided to try it out. For drinks we ordered the Sangrita that our waitress recommended. I love Sangria, I love Margaritas, so I'm already sold! & It was delicious! For the entree I ordered the Blue Corn Enchiladas. Oh my gosh... get this when you come! I got it with shredded chicken and it is topped with a fried egg. & of course I have to get the Christmas sauce. Sooooo good!! 

I really loved this place. Our waitress was so helpful with her recommendations and extremely friendly. Not to mention the food was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back for those enchiladas. But I also want to try their happy hour as well as their margaritas since they are known for their tequila as well. & you can get flights of their margaritas! =)"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place & have been meaning to try it, so today when I had a hankering for green chili, I picked up some takeout.

The place had a great bar/cocktail area & a nice separate dining room, from what I saw. 

I got the green chile pork stew & it came with well seasoned rice, chips and three different salsas, of which the verde was especially good! The stew was really good... super tender pork & I love the addition of potatoes & pinto beans. 

I'll be back here for sure :)

{"text":"Best shredded beef flauta I've ever had! I ordered from DoorDash so I can't comment on their customer service but their food was pretty tasty. I got the trio dinner with a green corn tamale topped with green sauce, a shredded beef taco and a shredded beef flauta. The flauta was a good size, crispy, filled with delicious shredded beef and covered in cheese. The taco was crispy and the beef again was tasty. Their rice and calabacitas were good too. My only criticism was the tamale. It was on the drier side and it was super spicy. The spice I attribute to the fact that this is a New Mexican restaurant. Having said that, I still ate the whole thing. Kudos to La Ristra, you've got a new happy customer."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't updated my review of this place.  After all this time, we still visit weekly and absolutely enjoy the atmosphere, service, and food!  This place is an incredible jewel in Gilbert!  We had a rehearsal wedding dinner here a couple of months ago and it was amazing - complete with a Mariachi Band by special request. From the standard menu items to their specials menu items I have yet to be disappointed by the quality and flavor of the food. The service is always very timely and friendly.  Give it a try for lunch, dinner, or a fantastic happy hour!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend afternoon for chips/salsa and beer, and left less than satisfied.

Chips and salsa were just okay. Several, small containers of various salsas provided. Me? I prefer a nice sized bowl of a medium-spiced, homemade salsa. Chips were good.

Beer? The DosEquis Lager was flat.

Ambience? Not the best place for watching TV unless ur sitting right at the bar. Also, they were piping country music over the speakers at a hearty volume--which was bad enough, until one patron shared his musical \"talents\" with us. Why me?

Service? Friendly and efficient, but could not save the day.

Probably won't be back.

Cheers!

{"text":"We where severely underwhelmed by this restaurant. The decor was beautiful and as we are big fans of Los Dos Malinos we were excited to try it out - boy were we disappointed. The restaurant was filthy - no excuse as the restaurant was empty- there where crumbs on our booth and more on the floor - the glasses and silverware where both dirty and chipped and both knives were bent in a c shape not sure who they have doing dishes but they need to be fired. The waitstaff were subpar our waitress apparently left for the day without even letting us know - the food was just ok, bland with not much flavor the only thing that was really good was the green salsa, I asked for no cheese and while they didnt put cheese on the chicken they put it on the beans ???? They didn't bring out our sopapia till we questioned them about it at the end of the meal and it was really greasy and tasted like it was cooked in the same oil as the chili reannos were. Lastly even though they have been open a while there is construction stuff all around the out aid rod the restaurant ..ie buckets of paint, boxes of stuff, and the patio had a bucket of lamp oil, a 1/2 bag of charcoal, a watering can and other stuff all over the place. There was also an open box of something who knows what in the middle of the lobby when we left. All in all it looks like they have very poor management with little or no attention to detail and no customer service to speak of."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been stopping in here several times since they opened. I have to say I am impressed with what they have done. We have been to many other \"Mexican\" style restaurants in the area and would have to say we really love this place. My favorite is the Blue Corn Enchiladas, with a fried egg on top. thought that was unusual at first but come to find out is normal with \"new\" Mexican style food. I usually get it with green enchilada sauce because I am told its the spiciest. My wife prefers red which is slightly milder. Adovada Pork is apparently their specialty and I don't know anywhere else that does their pork this way and we love it! If you eat here try it, its spicy and rich, its really unbelievable!!

We do recommend this place, and will more than likely be there next time we go out for Mexican!!"}
{"text":"The food is not exactly in par with what I had in New Mexico since I've grew up in Albuquerque.  The decors certainly rivals the best New Mexican restaurant and it reminds me of many places in Santa Fe and Taos.  They have as many varieties of Margarita's just like the Maria's in Santa Fe.  The only draw back was they only gave me one sopapilla and didn't serve it in honey which I had to request each and every time.  It is a decent attempt on Land of Enchantment so I will return soon."}
{"text":"Blech. Disgusting!  Just went for a quick appetizer and to feed the kids and it was horrible. Kids food was fresh out of the freezer/microwave and I can make a better quesadilla at home. And I can't cook."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful, complimentary chips and salsa were completely addicting, guacamole was delicious. We also tried the green chile stew (wonderfully flavored and spicy), a chimichanga, and the stacked blue corn enchiladas (both with chile Colorado), spicy and very good. Large portions. We will be back the next time we need a lil spice in our lives!"}
{"text":"We really like this place! I grew up eating grandmas Mexican food, and this place reminds me of grandmas cooking. The beans are the best! And the chili is so flavorful! We have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Just ehh, waiter was nice enough. Did not even come close to hitting the spot. Salsa was good"}
{"text":"Motor dogg here! Been a long time since I've done a review, quite frankly got tired of some of the yelpers out there complaining about how the ice was not cold enough in their glass! So here's a real review. Get your pimply face over to La Ristra. This place is better than Los Dos Molinos and The Blue Adobe.  I had the blue corn enchilada dinner  with beef and Christmas Style sauce and the pinto beans.  All I can say is wow!! Flavor country my friend......and a fried egg on top? Get outta town!!! Now for all of you gringos this is New Mexican style food.......look it up. Most New Mexican style food has one to two flavor profiles in a dish. But La Ristra has kicked it up a huge notch. So when you get there try the Green Chile Beer with the chips n salsas.  Now if you think tomatoes are hot or the salsa they serve at your local Garcias is muy caliente (real hot for those of you who don't habla) then order the taco with ketchup and go grow a pair then come back. However if you like it spicy and a delicious mouth watering burn then hall yourself and your squeeze down to the Ristra.  Oh........and make sure you bring an appetite. Oh and Kristina it's NEW MEXICAN  food! And yea I know.......HALL IS SPELLED WROng!"}
{"text":"Have attended a couple of networking events here. It's a great space for events like that. The food is pretty good. I've had the southwest salad, which could use just a little more kick in the dressing, but it's hearty and packed with veggies. I also had the queso with pork appetizer. Again very hearty, I liked it. 

The prices are also very reasonable, so I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Had the stuffed sopapillas and chimichanga farmer style with christmas sauce.  Service was excellent. Loved the 3 different salsas that came with the chips."}
{"text":"We went to La Ristra on a Sunday evening to celebrate my parent's birthday's.  We were pretty disappointed overall.  

We decided to try this place out based on the recommendation of a co-worker.  He actually lives close to the owner and the reviews on Yelp have been fairly positive so we thought it wouldn't be a very risky proposition.

The restaurant was fairly empty but because our party was so \"large\" (we had six people) we had to sit in the dark, completely empty banquet room next to the table with dirty dishes stacked up.  I'm not sure why we had to do this; we could very easily have pushed two tables together in the main dining room since it wasn't particularly busy.

The service was just okay.  Our waiter wasn't particularly friendly but he did go out of his way to explain the menu.  He was awkward and was unintentionally intrusive  (he interrupted more than conversation without the traditional \"excuse me\".)  He did forget some sides of guacamole and sour cream that were ordered.  We didn't really have an issue for that but didn't want to get billed for them, which we reminded him about.  Even then, he still only removed one of the two items from the bill.

The food itself was pretty disappointing.  I had the blue corn enchiladas with rice and pinto beans.  It seemed to me that my food had been maybe sitting under a heat lamp for a while as the rice was crunchy and dried out on the top and the refried beans had that same quality.  The enchiladas were a bit lacking in flavor.  My wife had the green chili stew which she was a bit disappointed with as it also suffered from a lack of flavor.  The only person who seemed to enjoy their meal was my mother who had a green chili cheeseburger.  She said it was fine.

They did give the table some free sopapillas to celebrate my parents birthday's.  It was appreciated, but at that point we just wanted to leave.

I really wanted to like this place but I found the menu lacking and the service disappointing.  I've seen the other positive reviews and I'm thinking that maybe Sunday night isn't the best time to go there.  Regardless, with how disappointed I was, I most certainly couldn't recommend this restaurant and will certainly never return with so many other superior options available in the area."}
{"text":"Jared made our dining experience an awesome one. Best server ever. Love the food as well."}
{"text":"Terrible service experience, terrible food.  Sent out a frozen corn dog for one of the kids, literally frozen.  Took 20 minutes to get drinks and all meals came out at different times.  Over easy eggs where over hard and meals came without tortillas.  

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Been here twice this time i ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, oh was i surprised as to how small my plate was, i actually thought it was an appetizer. Only 4 medium sized shrimp and a handful of rice and beans. Everybody else's plate was twice as big and cheaper than mine. Nick our server was great but i recommend management  that they make this plate bigger since you pay more than the other entrees. I was displeased and left hungry which never happens when i eat at a restaurant. If anything i always have leftovers."}
{"text":"I just ate there with my boyfriend, and it was amazing. We will definitely be back. I think the owners are related to those of Los Dos. It isn't super spicy, but there is some heat, which is nice, since most places take out all the heat for those who can't handle it. What really stood out was the flavor of the chili. I don't know where they get it from, but both the red and green was super. I loved the trio of salsa as well, and I'm picky about salsa. I'm usually disappointed in the salsa department. The chips were thin, crispy, & addictive. I had the stacked blue enchiladas with beef Colorado, Christmas style, wow. It was so yummy. I also had the calabacitas. I can't find these anywhere else, and I have missed them. The boyfriend enjoyed his fajitas. Anyways, this is New Mexican cuisine. You may have had better but it's pretty up there on the delicious scale. The service was so friendly, helpful, and kind. I mean not even just our waiter, but the hostess, and everyone else that helped out. I think it is just a little kept secret, partly location, and it doesn't look like much. Which is nice when there are 30 minute waits everywhere else. Give it a try. I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"We always love the food at La Ristra!  Last night we had great food and especially wonderful service!  Got right in during the busy dinner hour on a Saturday night and had Tommy as our server!  Personality plus!  Never disappointing!"}
{"text":"Went here with friends.  Said they liked the place from a painting event that was their.  Was definitely not disappointed.  Loved their variety of Salas.  Food was good.  Service was just OK.   Will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  has a really lively atmosphere and on weekend evenings they have live music (which can get really loud if you're sitting in the bar).

the flights of margaritas are really fun to taste test - have a bunch of flavors to choose from.

we had a chicken chimichanga and split it.  it was really large so splitting it was perfect.  we did \"chistmas style' so they put 1/2 green and 1/2 red sauce on the burrito which is fun.  chips come with a few different salsas

staff was quick to serve and were all very friendly.  prices are pretty reasonable too - especially for the portion size."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and one of the few places where I have multiple favorites. The service is excellent and makes for a great environment. Their brunch on Sunday is our regular stopping g place. They also cater and we used them for my wife's birthday party. Turned out great."}
{"text":"The son of the owners of Los Dos Molinos will do well here. Good draw from the neighborhood, great Tequilas, and terrific food!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with the family on Saturday evening. Started off bad with trying to order through Yelp. (Totally not La Ristra fault at all!!) Joey helped get things situated and got our food delivered. First off can I start by saying Mexican food delivered.... GENIUS!!! Tired of only having pizza or Chinese food as the only delivered food. We ordered three different burritos and got them all chimichanga style. All three were super good... comes with sour cream (it has some kind of pepper seasoning mixed it... delicious I must say) and guacamole at no extra cost... can't beat that. Only negative thing about the restaurant personally was all three chimichangas were suppose to come with green sauce over them which none did. Oh and their rice wasn't bad but nothing real special. Also ordered the trio platter with chicken, shredded beef and ground beef enchiladas in their mild red sauce. Kids loved them except the ground beef one. Over all was great; will make sure to tell them to put extra green sauce on the side in case they forget it next time."}
{"text":"I come here very excited every time I am in town...today not so much.  I had to go to the hostess stand and grab my own menus...you could tell that John and andrea were not here...there were too many Indians and not enough chiefs. Poor service and lack of attention to details. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved in to the area and were hoping to find a new, great neighborhood , friendly bar. We mentioned we were new to the area and the bartender could care less. He seemed bothered and rushed, but found him and other employees chit chatting and playing around.  We were not impressed and there are really no good happy hour drink specials worth making this place our new neighbor hangout. On a positive note.. the queso fundido was pretty good and spicy. Still, unhappy about the quality of attention we received."}
{"text":"This was good, but not in a hurry to return.  The margaritas weren't that good.  The guacamole was good and the salsas were average.  The adovada ribs and carne asada were REALLY good!  The green chile platter with beef and the carnitas were good, but nothing special.  Our waiter was very nice, attentive and helpful!   Overall good, nothing special."}
{"text":"Amazing food, had delivery and went to the restaurant. Really a fun place and the staff is so friendly and give great recommendations. Their burritos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Not good.  The food was luke-warm on a hot plate.  The carne adovada was bland and had a giant piece of snotty fat in it.  The salsas looked like they were reused for me from a past table.  Beans were bland.    Plus, they brought the food out faster than if I'd been at McDonald's.  At least give me the impression you cooked it back there, and at least make sure it's hot!  

Really awful, and I'm sorry to say that, as it looks like a local, Gilbert joint."}
{"text":"Wow! We had the blue corn enchilada and the new Mexico burrito. Both were excellent. Found our new favorite place in east phoenix for some good mexican food. Also had the banana reno (which was basically ice cream with deep fried tortillas and banana) not an everyday thing but was a nice treat for us. The reviewers were correct in this place. In 4 months, we will be trying the tequila but for now... only one of us would be drinking lol"}
