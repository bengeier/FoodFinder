{"text":"This is not a very clean place but I'm a man and stayed anyways. Not clean but ok. Bathrooms were dirty. The owner was not friendly at all. I saw him treat a well dressed, seriously disabled person at the next table with contempt and disrespect which the man did not appear to deserve. That was it for me. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Terrible. Went for breakfast. Eggs and bacon burnt horridly. Inedible. Advised when paying bill it was awful and inedible. They tried to charge me full price for that meal and when I complained further they offered to take half that meal off bill claiming that I ate half of that garbage. I barely touched it. Was excessively rude and confrontational. Said I should have sent it back to be re-cooked. Um... the waitress never even came around to see if everything was ok. Accused me of just coming in to get free meal and told to leave and never come back. No problem there. Terrible food  and even worse customer service. Perfect place to go if you want bad food and to be verbally berated by staff."}
{"text":"Sad I can't give it zero stars. Every time I drive by the place is empty and now I know why.  The fish was the tail end and filleted even thinner,  think; sushi fish and chips. The batter was rock hard to the point the knife couldn't cut it so I had to pick it up like a pizza slice. Everything was hmmm? On par with the fish. I left it and paid $15 for nothing.  Tantamount to theft"}
{"text":"This place exceeded expectations. We ordered the halibut and shrimp dinner which was a massive portion. The batter is light and flakey. The tarter sauce was good and we had a soup on the side was pretty good too. The service was prompt. I'd come here again"}
