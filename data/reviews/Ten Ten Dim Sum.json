{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, and will be over looked unless you go seeking it. Great variety of frozen dimsum at a great price of $10 for 2 bags. TNT supermarket sells the exact same brand for $11+tax for 2 bags.  My favourites are: Pork, pork and leek, shrimp and leek, the wonton dumplings.  They also offer dumplings filled with napa cabbage, but as a Korean who already eats enough kimchi, I passed on these.  TIP: They dont answer the phone or have biz hours posted. Open 7 days a week 11am-7pm. Owner is very kind!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. Have been coming for years. This is the brand of frozen dumplings, etc. I buy most of (as in like 95% of the time when I buy dumplings).  No fresh food here, guys. All frozen. Dumplings, wontons, steamed buns and other lovely things galore! Really good prices too.  For those of you who buy steamed buns and dumplings at Chinese grocery stores in TO, you have probably seen the Ten Ten brand. This is their wholesale store. They also carry a larger product variety than Chinese grocery stores do (I have yet to find their wontons in stores other than this one).  Highlights:  Dumplings (2 bags for $8) - about 40-50 dumplings in a bag. Ton of different varieties. I like pork and leek, and pork and celery. Retails for $8.88/2 bags at cheapest, if I'm not mistaken. I like to boil mine for a few minutes, then pan fry a la guo tie (pan fried dumplings, anyone?)  Wontons (3 packs for $10) - 21 or so wontons in a pack. Wontons have the super thin skins (which I love), and are incredibly flavorful, even if just boiled and not put into a soup base.  Egg and Leek pockets/pancakes (3 packs for $8) - These are almost like Chinese quesadillas (shape-wise), and are filled with scrambled egg, leek, and vermicelli. They're savory and they make a really easy lunch. They take about ten minutes to pan fry, or ten minutes in the oven. I prefer them pan fried, but baking requires less supervision. No, the instructions are not on the back. This is just how my family does them.  My family tries to stock Ten Ten products in our freezer, but they never last very long. Quick, easy, cheap, delicious meal ideas!  P.S. Did I mention that these things include tax already? Yeah. As if they weren't cheap enough already."}
{"text":"Based on the 2 reviews, bought these dumplings for my daughters.  They agree it's the best store bought brand and i agree.  Though frozen, once cooked, very juicy and the leek /chives still bright green in color.  So fresh and cheap.  I go back every 2 weeks to buy more. Thx for the tip."}
{"text":"This store should have more reviews.  I said reviews not business, because this place is BUSY!  First of all, thank you for Joanne L's referral to this wholesale store.  After the closure of its storefront at Peachtree Mall, I thought Ten Ten only sold through grocery stores.  I am glad that I found another wholesale storefront.    As mentioned, Ten Ten sells through major Chinese grocery stores.  I always look for their sales.  The sales at grocery stores is usually $10 for 2 bags.  At this wholesale location, they are priced at $8.88 for 2 bags.  This is freaking cheap for 80 to 100 dumplings (average 40 to 50 dumplings per bag).  This location also carries hand made dumplings (the ones in grocery stores are machine made).  They are at $11 per bag.  I don't buy these, because I can't taste the difference.  Last but not least, the selection here is much wider.  Some varieties, such as lamb meat dumplings, are only available here.  If low price and good value are not incentives enough for you to shop here, I would also add that the dumplings taste good.  Their meat content is more substantial than many other grocery brands.  When cooked, the skin looks thin.  Are they restaurant quality?  It depends on the restaurant.  Personal opinion is they taste better than many."}
