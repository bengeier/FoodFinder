{"text":"Good and inexpensive quite place. Not the best place in the world but would come back again. I liked the service always ready to refill my cup... Granted there was only 2 other tables in the whole restaurant. Bottom line is solid 3 stars"}
{"text":"I figured out why I go to this place..  It's not the newest place,  as a matter of fact,  it's old.  The place hasn't been updated since it opened.  It's not the food,  as a matter of fact,  it's run of the mill,  bland Chinese food.  It's the price.  For 13 bucks, you can get 2 to go orders full of starchy sweet fill your belly food.  And that's it.  I have had much much better Chinese,  and worse. So 3 stars is all I'm saying."}
{"text":"Poor service and rushed thru a small display of buffet with limited choices. The basic of a Chinese restaurant, should have been a red flag. But wanted to see if a hole in the wall could be a gem. Not to be, just a bad experience. So for basic Chinese food save your $ .and time."}
{"text":"We went there last night.  The line was long so we waited a few minutes before paying the cashier. Me and wife paid a total of $15 for the buffet and 2 drinks.  The server was friendly, the food was good.  My favorite is the lemon chicken.  All and all I will come back."}
{"text":"It a great $6 buffet!....If the food was fresher longer I'd give it a 5 star! Service it great and price it right ...been going there for 30 years and they have been there since the 1970's
Amazing Egg Foo Young...The only place I will eat it!
You can also get take out!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be delicious. I went for dinner and at first was a little bit skeptic at eating here because it needs a remodel and the buffet selection was small.

I decided to stay due to the prices being low. REALLY GOOD DECISION. The food was fantastic, even the filler food was good. I plan on going back."}
{"text":"My parents have been coming here since the 80s. For a while it was the only chinese food I ever knew....well, my taste buds are not particularly fond of Autumn Moon anymore. The only thing I can tolerate is the Sweet and Sour Pork. Nothing has been done to improve the look of the place. I wouldn't be surprised if they still have the same plates and cups they used when I went here as a child. It's not the worst I have had but it's no where near the best!"}
{"text":"Been going here since 1986. The menu hasn't changed. No it's not gourmet Chinese food BUT..... I still crave the taste of the food from this place after all these years. Great price as well. There's just something about it that keeps me wanting more. I have paid $12.99 at other places and still would prefer the food at Autumn Moon over anywhere else.... Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat with the price they offer. Not many food choices but what they have is not bad. A good place to eat when every other place fail to prompt you."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago went to the bathroom and seen a cockroach on the floor so I killed it . It makes me think what else is crawling around in there never go back again"}
{"text":"They don't really have variety of selections to choose from. Their chow mein was super dry. The place was too small and had too much flies in it. None of their food was hot when ordered. Food was cold. This place is just awful. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"ewww!! I was dragged here and was not interested.....  I'm not a huge fan of Mesa in the first place...and this place was sketchy to say the least....Just don't go!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awful!! I had way better Chinese buffet! The only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef! First and last time there with my coworkers! The orange chicken was more bread then chicken and let alone zero orange flavor!"}
{"text":"this place has been here long time its old but awesome lowcost huge quanity food we get takeout big enough to share others complain i dont know why its old place 40 years or longer same prices"}
{"text":"Lovely staff and A one service.  Always filling your waters.  Food was replenished often. The place was clean.   Now for the food.  First let me tell you that the price is $6.50 for all you can eat.  You would spend more at McDonald's or Burger King.  
Limited variety but for $6.50 it was fine.  Selection was chow mein noodles, sweet and sour pork, BBQ chicken, veggie fried rice, Beef with broccoli (really broccoli with beef, LOL), pepper steak, egg rolls, orange chicken, lemon chicken,  egg fu young hockey pucks, wonton chips.  
This is NOT gourmet Chinese food.  Gourmet chinese food would be $14.99 for one entree plus tax and tip.  So for you guys that knock the hell out of this place, think about that.  
Dishes I liked:  
Broccoli (garlicky and not over cooked) 
chow mein noodles were not greasy
veggie fried rice not greasy and fresh
Beef and peppers  nice taste
BBQ chicken  pretty good
Wontons were not greasy.  Crispy.
egg rolls were veggie and not greasy

Did not like Orange or lemon chicken because of the thick, thick crust.  If you don't mind a heavy crust, it's good.

We were hungry, saw the place (which does not look good from the outside because of dirty greenhouse windows) and took a chance.  
Would not travel to get here again, but these are decent, honest working people serving up fresh food."}
{"text":"Ok, so a lot of negative reviews but the great thing about buffets is that if you don't like one thing you just grab something else.  I had the egg fu young, orange chicken, chicken chow mein, and a beef dish (I think it was pepper beef... I honestly don't remember).  The food wasn't popping with flavor but honestly, it didn't need to. It was good. And the orange chicken was some of the best I've had.  

Also, unlike a lot of \"Chinese\" food, it wasn't salty, which is nice.  It had enough flavor to be enjoyable.  

My only real complaint about the food was the lack of a selection.  But even with the small selection I found food that I liked.  

The service is what makes this place special.  The woman serving us was always quick to replenish our drinks.  Always friendly. She really made you feel your business was appreciated. Their service is the number one reason why I would return. 

I dined in but I saw several order takeout.  The employees will fill the to-go container for you but they are not stingy at all.  So if you're hungry and want something quick to go, this could be a good place for you."}
{"text":"Great local place been coming here for years the food is great service is on point can't be more satisfied with them will always come here"}
{"text":"I wrote a review for this place a long time ago. Met here with an old friend for lunch today...this use to be our lunch spot of choice back in the 80's & 90's. Sure...it's cheap/faux chinese food, but we love it! Sure...the egg foo young looks like slices of canned dog food floating in some kind of funky brown liquid, but they taste good! They don't have a huge selection, but we enjoy everything they serve!"}
{"text":"2 roaches crawling in the lemon chicken dish. Waitress used the chicken tongs and squashed the roaches inside the dish, picked them out, put the tongs back in the dish, moved the chicken around and left it. Stayed to see if they would throw it out.... they didn't. They let other customers fill their plates up.....disgusting."}
{"text":"Don't know what my deal is but I love me some dirty little chinese buffet food. I have eatin it all around the world. Except for china (ironically enough) and I've yet to find a gem like this one hidden away on country club drive in Mesa, AZ U.S. And A."}
{"text":"THE worst Chinese buffet ever. Literally has six items to choose from. The buffet is about 15 feet long. Come on guys! No selection. No deserts. Never again. It was $6.75 without a drink and it was worth about $1.25. 

I should've looked at the buffet before I paid. BIG MISTAKE. So for that aspect its part my fault.

I don't know how this place stays in business. It was lunch and it was dead. 

Never got the craps afterwards but that was a surprise. Probably because I ate half my plate and left early.

DON'T EAT HERE. TRUST ME. You're welcome..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years and the place is always consistent. By far my favorite hole in the wall Chinese food joint.

Don't change a thing! Love this place and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else says, I love this place. 
It is definitely not gourmet but it is really good. If you want a fancy building and cloth covered tables then keep moving, this isn't the place for you. The staff might not go out of their way to be your best friends but they are not unfriendly in the least. I think people knock stars on here if the staff doesn't give out hugs with drinks. You get your food and a drink is delivered to the table and refilled when you need it. Again if you want more than this for $7 then don't come here. 
If you want pretty good food for cheap and know that's what you want you won't be disappointed, if your looking for more than that, keep driving. This is a neighborhood place and has been her forever because it is good. Places don't stay open for 40 years and not be good to a majority of people. 
I love this place and have for thirty years, I am in the majority so she hat means you're wrong."}
{"text":"This place is great easy on the wallet heavy on the belly tasty and great service eat here more I really enjoyed the lemon sauce they had out"}
{"text":"Good pice for the amount of food that you get on your plate. Options for take out or buffet."}
{"text":"This is quite frankly one of the most disgusting chinese buffets I have visited. The food had nothing redeeming about it and was very cold. It was also extremely limited on selection. I am not extremely picky with chinese buffet - I'm a huge fan of even the mediocre ones- but this place is worse than bad. I would avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"The stars are for the service. Very nice and hospitable. If you're looking for quality Chinese food you are in the wrong place. Definitely get what you pay for. When I came here the noodles were burn, rice was stale, and the meats were swimming in sauce which made the chicken and pork either way to sweet or way to salty. I'm not saying don't come here...just be prepared :)"}
{"text":"The price was decent but the food was not good at all. A lot of open tables and all were dirty - I had to clean our own table. The sweet and sour pork sauce was very runny. The mood of the staff was very \"non-interested\". Had to pay for drink refill. Not very many selections of food items and I could see that the place is not kept up with simple maintenance issues. On the plus side the price for 4 was only 35.00."}
{"text":"Love this place, been going there for 30+ years. My favorite is the sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"I frequent this Buffet on the regular and me and my family enjoy the food and love the service"}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 30 years. The menu has not really changed any. It is a small buffet with unique offerings compared to other Chinese buffets. But different in a good way. If you try it, you will be back."}
{"text":"This is an old school style Chinese buffet. The buffet with a glass of water was $7.00 exact. Arrived about 11:35 am The buffet is very small with a total of 12 items. 

I am not sure if the items rotate daily or not. On the Tuesday I visited they were offering: Fried rice, Beef with vegetables, Chicken chow mein, Egg Foo young, Egg roll, Lemon chicken (sauce optional, think breaded sweet and sour chicken pieces), Pepper steak, Orange chicken, Sesame chicken, Kung Pao chicken, Sweet and Sour pork, Fried wonton. 

Overall I felt all the breaded items were overcooked, including the eggroll. The breading on all of them were very hard.

The orange chicken sauce was extremely sweet, the sauce had moistened the breading somewhat. 
The Kung Pao chicken had a bit of spice to it and was average. 
Chicken chow mein was fairly bland. 
Sweet and sour pork was decent. The eggroll was hard to eat because it was so overcooked. I waited for a fresh batch but those were overcooked as well.

I felt that all dishes were either extremely on the salty side (I rarely find anything salty tasting) or the very sweet side. It was worth the one time visit, but not to my personal style. Price wise, it is very low for a buffet.

The waitress was extremely attentive and refilled my water several times."}
{"text":"Ok, limited items in buffet, pretty much the same every visit. 5 stars because food is fresh delicious and service is polite and prompt. Very inexpensive for a good all you can eat buffet. If you want a good Chinese lunch the orange chicken, egg rolls and noodles are outstanding."}
{"text":"I've low key loved this place but never really talk about it out loud. After many really disappointing value Chinese food experiences I'm fully rethinking what Chinese food means to me. Most of the time it means dirty deep fat fried chicken with some seriously sugary citrus sauce and we all know that orange chicken life. This lemon chx is dirty fried smoky tasting and paired with some amazing lemon sugar goo sauce and kept separate until being served. I always get it to go usually but right now just thinking that this lemon chicken goes on unlimited down the street drives me kinda crazy right now. It's like $7. So much food. haha yes"}
{"text":"I have grown up eating Autumn Moon. It was a tradition growing up when we would put up a Christmas tree we would watch Dust Til Dawn and get Autumn Moon. This happened several years in a row by accident. But anyways, I love Autumn Moon. We got my 5-year-old niece hooked on it too. I took several friends there to eat and we all love it. My family has dined in and did carry out, we order double meat (extra charge) for carry out. My mom and dad love dining in because they get the delicious hot tea. I get water (how can water be stale? From a previous reviewer), water is water. I learned to love and eat broccoli because of Autumn Moon. Their Chow Mein is delicious, their broccoli, egg rolls dipped in their sweet and sour sauce that comes in the chicken is delicious. My double meat is usually the sweet and sour chicken and the lemon chicken with the lemon sauce (add the sauce to the noodles, so good!). Plus the chips. My niece makes a noodle/chip sandwich and loves their orange chicken as it isn't spicy (like Panda) and she loves it. My mom gets their orange chicken and pepper steak, depending on the bite or who makes the pepper steak it can be okay or it can be spicy. 
I have never been sick from Autumn Moon, never had raw food. Never had under cooked food. Everything has been hot and delicious. 

My family has eaten their so much they know us there. So, for the people who have gotten sick from it, I don't know why. It isn't the greatest but it's cheap and whether you do the buffet or do carry out, they load up the carton that it's almost overflowing. 

The restaurant is quiet, little, it's worn (not really dingy as it's been there for as long as I can remember). 

I love it, but I guess to each their own. If you are expecting Panda Express, NO. Sushi? NO. They have a small menu as they are a small place. Rice, chow mein, egg roll, egg fu whatever, lemon chicken, orange chicken, pepper steak, some bbq type thing, sweat and sour pork, and the chips. There might me one or two other's I'm missing but whatever. The soda glasses are just simple regular glass, you get one drink then pay for refills (which is why I get water) but the tea is refillable. The food is not salty, not spicy (except for the occasional pepper steak). This isn't a high class Chinese food place, but a simple small family owned and operated Chinese buffet. One that you would find in a small corner of China Town or downtown China that is a well known secret. 
I have never had any complaints, both from family, friends or stomach (I might just have a stronger stomach than many of the reviews). I will continue to eat there for as long as it is there."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. I had a complete lapse of judgment and picked up a meal here. Don't repeat my mistake.

The food is low quality, drowning in badly made sauces, and not even close to healthy. Chinese can be done well, but this isn't it. It's a shame that so many vegetables were wasted in a poor attempt to make these dishes.

It's not a buffet -- it's counter where you point and they scoop. There are around five entrees, rice and noodles. You can sit down in a sticky booth or just take your styrofoam container with you."}
{"text":"been going here for 20 years--best chow mein..eggrolls ever///hot tea free wth meal.....lunch under $6 all you can eat......always delicious...always ready......"}
{"text":"Both my husband and I about puked...very generic dont waste your dollar. The drinks are small and they charge you for refills or give you stale water. Was ill for a few hours."}
{"text":"Not a ton of selection, but everything available is really good! A little hole in the wall, Ma and Pa restaurant, but cheap for a buffet and good, authentic food. Don't be scared off by the old fashion exterior/ interior."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of choices but the food is pretty good and the price is reasonable.  The server's are very nice.  The restaurant is clean inside and out"}
{"text":"Not the best experience I've ever had at a buffet... Noodles had no flavor beef was rubbery and on top of that we had to pay for drink refills after paying $2 for a drink begin with which was 90% ice do not recommend to anybody unless you're vegetarian because the broccoli was the highlight of the meal. :)

I forgot to mention there quarter machine ate my nephew's quarter when he was trying to get a toy and they said they couldn't do anything because the machines were rental which was obviously a lie. :)"}
{"text":"This place opened in the 70's grew up eating here was always my family's little go to was one of the first buffets in mesa good food good prices simple menu can I say more"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time as a kid because my mom never cooked and we would usually eat left over chinese food through out the week. I recently went there as an adult and the food is still cheap and very delicious. My advice is dont look at the walls and dont look at the decorations becuase the place is so old it looks like its going to fall apart. They have about four different entrees and two different sides, soda is only a dollar but they charge for refills. Best advice if you want to venture out is get it to go and enjoy it at home. The food actually taste like chinesse food and not chain restaurants like Panda Express."}
{"text":"Giving stars not on quality, but on speed and the amount of food you get for about $5. I order it take out and eat a meal out of the container and have enough left over for lunch the next day. Its not amazing, but strangely addictive."}
{"text":"Ill go here when i want Chinese food for a low price!
its simple nothing fancy but it fills my stomach when i want Chinese food really bad. 
friendly service. will go back."}
{"text":"place is okay for what it is. low price chinese food for fat people on a budget.
for about 6 bucks you get a styrofoam plate filled with your choice of entrees and sides up the whazoo. the decoration sucks and the place needs a remodel big time. they have about 7 entrees with 3 sides and 2 soups. soda is a dollar with 25cent refills."}
{"text":"Ill start out the review with a GROOOOWL! Thats the noise my stomach was making 10 min after eating here! I stopped by at lunch to pick something up to go. Its pretty cheap but you only get 1 meat, if you want another its a extra 1.50. I got 2 meats and noodles. The place itself looks pretty run down and honestly I should have known from the get go what I was getting myself into. The food was actually pretty good flavor wise, but within 10 min my stomach turned upside down! It sat heavy in my stomach for a good 3 hrs and eventually I ended up throwing up a few times. My hope was to get it out of my stomach! It made me feel so sick I ended up skipping my afternoon workout and instead curled up on the couch trying not to continue to throw up! Last time ill be stopping by this spot!"}
{"text":"1 star joint. A great place to pass time with friends and family. But food is one star compared to Panda Express."}
