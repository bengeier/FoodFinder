{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE, do yourself a favour and don't come here. There are plenty of other kabab places I will be going to from now on.  My sister and I went to pick up our order we had placed on the phone. When we had gotten there around 30-45 mins later, we had found out that it had not even been made! That we would have to wait for them to cook it. When we first got there they had not even acknowledged us, they had made us wait forever and didn't even have our food ready!  They had let us know that they had given our food away to someone else. If you give our good away you should make another right away- common sense. They mad no attempts to apologize or rectify the situation.   Their \"apology\" bonus/extra is hard rice that had stuck to the pan.   Overall, one of the worst take-out experiences I have ever had. What is the point of take out? The place was not even busy, there was maybe 3 people dining in. No excuse for poor service."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. This guy is amazing . Once I was short couple of $ he wouldn't let me use my credit or break a bigger bill. He just told me to have s good New Years !!!!!!! Delicious clean food. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Delicious Iranian food!  I usually get takeout as the place is fairly small with only a few tables.  The food is made fresh and the portions generous.  I usually get the barg kabob which is like grilled pieces of beef tenderloin and my husband likes the koobideh which is grilled ground beef.  Your meal also comes with rice, grilled tomato, and salad.  I can never finish a meal in one sitting as they give you a lot of food. The rice is so tasty I could almost just eat the rice by itself! The meat is super tender and grilled to perfection.   The restaurant is tucked near the side/back of the plaza so it is hard to see from Yonge St.  There is ample parking.  Prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"A cozy, family owned, Persian takeout restaurant that is hidden in the corner. Menu is the usual (Kabab, Kobideh, chicken...etc). I tried out their Kobideh. Meat was juicy and fresh, portions were decent. extra friendly service, few available seats if you want to dine in, reasonable prices.  Worth checking out if you are in the area and would like to support local businesses. I surely recommend it for take outs."}
{"text":"Un professional, so much time wasting , rude , no service. They only can serve one customer more than that they would be confused ."}
{"text":"A real hidden gem - the food is fresh, with big portions and an excellent taste.   The selection of Persian drinks is a nice touch - very interesting malt beer."}
{"text":"Above average quality.  I usually order the koobideh or the vazeri kebobs.  Local mom and pop place.   Great for take out. Fair prices too."}
{"text":"Best koobideh kebab in the GTA hands down. After many tries at various kebabs from different persian eateries, this is the best by far. It is juicy, flavourful and you can tell its a high quality of meat. The rice is soft and cooked perfectly and once you add the butter, its a melt-in-your-mouth creation.  The steak kebab is good too especially the tangy pomegranate sauce they put over it. I think it was called kebab torsh. (?) Try out their peach nonalcoholic drink too, very tasty. Their khorsh bademjoon (eggplant stew) is delish. Grilled soft eggplant in a slightly greasy tomato sauce with chunks of cooked tomato.  The eating area is very small and Kako is better known for a take out place. Been here many times and always come back for more."}
{"text":"Kako Kebab is a legit Iranian resto. It's mainly a small take out joint that has a couple tables and stool counter tops to eat at. The food is spot on with other Iranian competition in the area.  Wholesome Iranian food that will leave your belly happy. If you haven't tried it, and your in the area, give it a go :)"}
{"text":"It is difficult rating a place like this because there is no waiter service, it is a hole in the wall, it looks half rundown, etc. but for what it is the rice was tasty, the kabob was delicious and tender, the portion was fair and 'salad' (i.e. lettuce and a slice of tomato and no onions) was included. Chelo Kabob is the Iranian national dish and they do it well. This take-out restaurant, with a slight perfunctory table, competes with Pardis and Taftan in the same area and does well. Pardis is probably my favourite because of the prices and availability of tables and services, but honestly all three are fine. Kako is a dollar or two cheaper than Taftan...  I had the sultani dish which is a mix of minced meat and sirloin, but they have the separate kabobs, lamb and chicken as well.   By the way between the restaurant's name, menu and website they are really confused on whether it is kabob, kebob, kebab or what...  Kako also advertises a delivery service, which I may just take advantage of!"}
{"text":"The koobideh kaba  be was really moist and good. The rice was ok, normal I guess. They served it on plastic plates which I didn't like. It was hot in the restaurant, no ac. The food kebab itself would be 4/5....experience 3/5... Overall 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Kako Kebob is a take out place that specializes in Chelow Kabab, a national dish of Iran.   Smell of grilled meat filled the plaza, but surprisingly I didn't smell like a piece of meat after I finished eating here...  Menu is simple... pick what meat you want.. but for this Sunday afternoon... Kako Kebob was out of quite a few items, we ended up having:  Joojeh (chicken) and Koobideh (minced meat) Combo ($8.99)   - The chicken though is tender but lack of much flavour aside from the really strong citrus taste... - Minced meat though is well seasoned and has this nice smokey bbq flavour! - I just wish the tomato was grilled a little longer  Kako Kebob's owner is exceptional nice and friendly. I could not resist when we were ordered free food to try:  Ghormeh Sabzi over some toasted rice, one of Iranian national dish... consisting herbs, beans and meat.   Istak Lemon and Watermelon was a great beverages to go with our meals ... which the owner again would not charge us for our drinks?!  Decent food and nice people working here... I would definitely be back again when I am in the area.... Lamb next time please!!"}
