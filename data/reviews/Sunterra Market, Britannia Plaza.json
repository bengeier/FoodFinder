{"text":"Sunterra has a lot of specialty products that are hard to find so I only go when I need to replenish something. It is pricey, but it is meant to be an upscale market-style grocer. That being said, I expect more at their prices. Their checkouts need an update - and the lighting is very dim throughout the store.  Many of their wire shopping basket are missing the corner wire, and things will fall through. I asked the staff for a plastic bag to use while I shopped and they told me to choose a different basket. I went through 3 more in their pile before finding one that the small glass extract bottles I was buying wouldn't slip through the corner and smash on the floor."}
{"text":"Sunterra has an undeserved reputation for quality.  We had a very poor experience with a catering order for a wedding on July 11 at the Britannia store.  Their inability to properly cross check their orders cost us 2 back to back trips over 3 hours between Canmore and Calgary which also led to the father of the bride missing the rehearsal in order to solve the problem.  The manager, Brian, was not at all helpful and rude when it came to resolving the problem.  No real  compensation for the hassles involved to the customer was offered other than 1 pie.  For $500 spent, their offer was one $9 pie.  Store staff admitted that the communications between the store and the catering dept are haphazard.  The attitude of the manager through this was unforgivable.  Be aware that using their catering dept may be a risky business."}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer here for many years. That's only because I live closeby and its convenient. The ground beef has to be the best in town that I have tasted, especially considering the price. The deli is questionable, as is the salad bar. Some of the staff are really good at helping the customers, while others have no product knowledge or an understanding of the English language. The bakery staff are very good and the bread is of excellent quality. They have improved in the last year as they now have some competition in the area, with ready made foods and take-out. The price of the everyday groceries and necessities are much higher than other stores."}
{"text":"i agree with other posters that the prices are higher than the box stores.  i just called at 2 pm asking if any chicken pot pies were available and chef said no but he could have staff make some for me.  i will be picking them up after 4.  isnt that service with a capital S?"}
{"text":"Picked up three desserts for lunch last week - two pieces of cheesecake and one carrot cake (if you could call it \"carrot\" cake).  All three were dried out and totally tasteless, not like the desserts we remembered having previously.  The carrot cake was so dry, it almost crumbled and was hard to cut.  All we could taste was spice, nothing else.  Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"I was recently deflowered by Sunterra Market here in Calgary. For all you Torontonians, it is the equivalent of The RichTree Marche.   You walk in, and you feel like you've entered another city! It feels like you're in Italy, wandering the market place!   The groceries are fresh and the desserts are to die for. The foods are well-cooked and the atmosphere is memorizing.   Yes, I'll admit that it is definitely on the pricier side, but I'm not surprised given the environment they have created! They have to support bringing Italy to us, so I can definitely support paying a bit extra to take an impromptu trip abroad ;)"}
{"text":"I love Sunterra Market....it's a nice and cozy atmosphere with a local feel. This Britannia location isn't the best of the bunch but it's a pretty solid market with some awesome pre-made food and tasty dessert.   I've always enjoyed dropping by and have a coffee and dessert and picking up some dinner or lunch items for the week. You'll some some things more pricey then your local superstore but you can't beat the experience of going into a small quant market like Sunterra.  Try it out...I'm sure you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Went here on a sunday with my mom and sister. Lots of samples to.try their fruit and their products. Prices are a bit more for some items so if you can shop around i would. They had samples of their banana bread which is so good here! They also sell.freshly squeezed OJ for 7.49. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Nothing says \"I laboured over this pumpkin pie so you better enjoy it\" like a pie purchased from Sunterra market.  There are a few interesting items you can't find any other groceries. I like their dried pre-made soups and chilis. I always come here to pick up their pre-made food for work lunches like their lasagna, scalloped potatoes, and meat loaf. They also have a great deli section, I love their curried chickpea salad.  The only thing that annoys me about this place, and this is me putting on my grumpy-old-man underwear, is the confusing parking lot I have to turn into from elbow drive. I always keep going down the wrong side! If you hear angry honking outside of Sunterra, guaranteed thats me driving up the wrong side of the road!"}
{"text":"I live very close by this gourmet grocery store, so I visit often. The staff here are always super friendly and helpful. The fruit selection is fresh with a good selection. My favourite is the pre cooked meals for two.  I recommend you try the banana bread, prime rib, butter chicken and many more. Sunterra smells of delicious coffee beans and the atmosphere is like an italian market."}
{"text":"Great market.  Some items a little more expensive that chain markets, but their beef is the best, and least expensive compared to any chain.  Will only go here for beef tenderloin.  Fresh squeezed o.j. is always a deal as well.  Usually just visit the Strathcona location."}
{"text":"I go to this Sunterra market on nights when I want to cook but I don't want to prepare food.  Their meat counter has all kinds of delicious marinated meats and stuffed chicken breasts that you can just bring home and cook.  It's quite pricey (usually close to $30 for two chicken breasts) but that is the price of convenience I guess."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I live close and we don't have great grocery store options so we go here kind of as a \"corner store\". It's small, expensive and it STINKS! Honestly, it smells rotten in there. How can the manager not smell but then go \"meh whatever\". The reason I'm giving 2 stars is only because they have awesome fresh thin crust pizzas for $7."}
{"text":"I don't make it to this location often simply because I have others within easy walking distance but when I'm in the area its likely I'm going to stop in.  Feeling peckish and trying to decide do I do the good thing; go home and cook - nah, do I eat out - trying to be good here! or do I pick up something ready made and heat it up at home - maybe, let's see what Sunterras got to entice me.  This location is a bit smaller and darker than some of the newer stores (Beltline or Sirocco Dr.) but its an original.  They have all the same great stuff in the butcher cabinet, bakery department and ready made dishes.  The grocery numbers are probably a little fewer than the newer bigger stores but they will still have the majority of what you are looking for at any given moment."}
{"text":"I didn't know that another Sunterra existed on the southwest side and so near to my home.  This is a larger location on a street corner that has all the tasty delights of the Sunterra deli but it also acts like a grocery store.    This is such an attractive shopping experience; besides the standard rows of produce, vegetables are displayed in baskets, there is a floral area with very nice colourful full arrangements, a small magazine and newspaper area, a bakery, cold meat and cheese area and a fresh meat and poultry butcher area.  I was amazed at the bakery selection, really nicely made cakes, fresh bread loaves and pastries at really affordable pricing.  I came away with a half dozen pecan butter tarts at $3.50 and I noticed that 5 star cakes and pies were all under $20.    What appealed to me the most was the dedication of the staff working there, first of all they are dressed very elegantly in their pristine Sunterra uniforms but they are so patient and present in serving their clients.  This is a refreshing way to get your shop on, in a market with an upper scale feel."}
{"text":"I really like this supermarket. The service is great!.. And everything is really fresh and organic!!.. Also, if you are lazy to cook,  you can find a lot of thing already made, that you just have to cook it without prepare it... In addition, They always have fresh fruits already sliced and ready to eat!! And fresh juices!... This is my favorite supermarket in the area!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto, I've found EVERYTHING in Calgary more expensive. But I've never seen anything like Sunterra before in my life - and I've shopped at Pusateri's and Bruno's and Summerhill Market.  Assessment: A good but insanely expensive meat counter and deli, a mediocre selection of insanely expensive shelf goods, a nice little bakery that actually isn't too stupidly priced for the quality, a piss-poor selection of too-often past-its-prime produce at prepare-for-the-apocalypse prices, and last but not least, ready-prepared meals that I can charitably describe as second rate - that they describe as \"gourmet\" and \"feasts\", and mark-up by 500 to 700% by my estimates.  These guys have the biggest cojones in the country."}
