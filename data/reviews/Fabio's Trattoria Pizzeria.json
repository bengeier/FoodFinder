{"text":"Went there on a whim late on a week night. We were so pleasantly surprised by this little BYOW resto. First of all, the service was excellent. Our waiter, Rutger, was prompt, polite and knowledge about the menu and the food prep. He was really a pleasant server. When we voiced our compliments to the chef our server conveyed them to the chef and the chef came to speak to us personally. We had a lovely chat with him. The food was fantastic! We started with their house ceasar salad that had wine pickled onions and homemade chips in lieu of croutons.  To die for. We also had the fried calamari that was excellent not a rubbery bite in the mouth served with a fantastic creamy, spicy dipping sauce. The mains were equally good. Pizza with excellent crust, homemade ravioli, and halibut with caper marinara sauce. The  chef made a custom bambino pizza for my young son that he loved. It is a bit on the pricey side but the ingredients were so fresh and the food so delish that the slightly higher price is a \"small price to pay.\" Try it and you will fall in love."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our evening out at Fabio's Trattoria!  From the moment we walked in the door till we left 3 1/2 hours later (our doing, the restaurant paced themselves to us)we were made to feel welcome   For supper we had the Insalata Capra, divine, lobster ravioli and seafood linguine  wonderful flavor, fresh and elegantly presented. The portions are perhaps small for some but here it is quality not quantity which is at the forefront. Big selling point for our choices was that the pasta is hand made there.   Dessert we had cannoli, crisp shell with decadent creamy filling as well as the tiramisu, lovely.   Must say the best part was our host/ waiter, unfortunately his name escapes me. Excellent in explaining the menu and helping us make our choices. He is also a sommelier and we had an interesting conversation about wines and left with a few of his suggestions.   Hope to return again to try some of the other items on the menu, all the plates we saw go by looked tasty!"}
{"text":"Situé dans le très jolie village de Hudson a l'ouest de Montréal, Fabio's trattoria pizzeria a une superbe terrasse a l'avant qui donne sur la rue main. Le service est fait par un jeune personnel dynamique et qui connaît son menu. Belle salle a manger avec des nappes de bistro italiens et de belles photos rappelant diverses régions du pays. L'antipasto servi sur une planche fut délicieux. De fines tranches de Calabrese, prosciuto ,saucissons,fromages et légumes marinés.  Les gnocchi aux fruits de mer étaient savoureux avec une belle quantité de calamars,pétoncles, crevettes, moules ainsi que des palourdes. La sauce dans laquelle trempaient le tout était d'une rare finesse. La pizza Sofia a la saucisse  et poivrons est énorme et savoureuse. Il est assuré que vous aller en rapporter a la maison. Il y a deux stationnements gratuits a proximité et une SAQ est également proche du restaurant pour vous procurer une bonne bouteille de vin pour accompagner les bons plats italiens de ce restaurant."}
