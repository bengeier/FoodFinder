{"text":"Horrible tasting food, I got the Thursday special which was char kway teow with yellow chicken curry. Chicken was mushy and very bland, the noodles had no flavour and lacked any sort of vegetables. Portion of noodle was small and they overloaded the meal with mushy chicken. Will not come here again. One of my worst experiences recently."}
{"text":"Thai Island is not too bad compared to other food court Asian food.  
Chilli Chicken and Chilli tofu - lots of green, red, chilli peppers and onions make these dishes quite flavourful.
Bean sprouts - very oily
Shrimp - I threw this one out.  The shrimp was not fresh, and it tasted a bit off. Bad flavour and rubbery texture.
Some other saucy chicken - I also threw this out.  I was not sure what I was eating.  
Pad thai and other noodles - just don't...
Stick with steamed rice.  Can't go wrong with the steamed rice.  lol

There is a deal after around 6pm (or 5:30?  Not sure what the exact time is), and I would not hesitate to get the small one item deal at $5.99."}
{"text":"The worst Thai restaurant ever. Do you guys really know how to make Pad Thai? It shouldn't served microwaved. Anything you order from the inside kitchen will be served microwaved."}
{"text":"My expectations of food court thai were pretty low so I am pleasantly surprises at the golden curry chicken I'm eating.  I mean, its fast food so obviously its pretty bland and not very flavorful but its not bad. I'm happy its not overly salty and everything is hot and fresh tasting. The portion is also generous."}
{"text":"It is the worst Pad Thai I've ever eaten.
I ordered a vegetable Pad Thai.They put just steamed vegetables.Taste is terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome.

If you're not vegetarian, get the SPICY BEEF on plain/white rice, do it, go now.... stop reading this, run, take a taxi, whatever, hurry.... are you still reading this??? Leave already!"}
{"text":"Earlier in the week I asked for a cup of hot water to go with my meal.  I got it.
Today I asked for hot water, cashier lady said \"we no give, unless you pay for hot tea\".  I tried communicating in Cantonese too and she said boss no longer allows them to provide a cup of free water to customers.
I will no longer visit this location."}
{"text":"As far as taste goes, I think it's absolutely amazing! Their fried rice has such a great fragrance that I don't know what is. Definitely don't taste it in Chinese places. And you can just wash the container they give you and take it back and reuse it, instead of throwing it out every time, I do it at the office just cause why not."}
{"text":"Was getting hungry after work, so decided to eat food court. Ordered their afternoon special 1 meat + 1 vegetable with the choice of noodle or rice for $7.99. Took some tofu vegetable and black pepper chicken with noodles. The food was not bad for the price they offered, but it was really salty. Was trying to finish it and quickly running home for water. I think next time I should stick with their soup noodles instead."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a long long time. Sadly in the past several months, the quality of the food has gone down south! 
 
Today, I ordered a Beef Pho, barely any beef in it (less than 50 grams, not kidding!).  I was so frustrated, since this had happened many times before,  that I went back for the first time and complained to the manager, explained why I am there, she got me a new order, the beef in the 2nd Pho looked so bad and weird that I tossed the whole thing in the garbage. 

They appear to cut corner on e v e r y t h i n g, including cutting the chili peppers in small pieces, using smaller food containers, raising prices, etc.  

Never EVER going back there again!"}
{"text":"Nice and fast, very good and fresh food for a food court place."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. The only reason they survive is because they're the only Thai place in one of the busiest food courts. Tried their noodle salad with grilled pork and spring roll - you can't compare it to a pho99 (in mississauga) . Nevertheless I'd probably come back from time to time due to its location"}
{"text":"I was downtown during lunch time and found myself in the good old Brookfield Place food court. With so many options, it was hard to pick one. I really wanted some pad thai though so I decided to give this place a try. 

Along with the usual pad thai, they also have pho (which I also tried before), curries, and the some stir fry dishes. From what I remembered, the pho was decent. The pad thai on the other hand was very acidic like they squeezed a whole lime onto it. It was super tangy and super red (and I still can't figure out what makes the noodles red). The chicken pieces were large though and serving was plenty for $11. The one thing that grossed me out was how oily the dish was. At the bottom of my bowl was a puddle of oil. Maybe they tried to dilute it with all that lime juice but sorry, didn't work, I still see it! Didn't quite satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"Good Thai location in the Brookfield food court. Your generic Thai flavors conveniently located. Pricing is reasonable for what you get. Compared to other Thai fast food joints, their a bit better in terms of taste and quantity, but its still a fast food establishment. 

Personally I get the pad Thai, chicken, seafood, or soy. Good amount of protein, and comes packed with various veggies. One annoyance is that they layer the ingredients instead of mixing it. - Would recommend asking to mix everything. Unless you want your first few bites to be bean sprouts and peanuts. 

Recently tried their buffet selection. Pricing varies on number of items, rice/noddle combinations. Overall good selection hot and fresh. The staff are not skimpy. 

Overall its okay, for the location and the type of food it works. If you want just convenient fast thai / Asian food during your lunch break this place is good. If you want that rich curry thai flavor you know what to do."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food. You get a big styrofoam brick of food for about $10. Got some chicken and pad thai and it was okay. It was enough to last me for 2 meals. It isn't particularly good, but just a lot of food. So the value is pretty good."}
{"text":"Went to Thai Island for the first time today and had the \"mung\", also known as \"bun\" (depending on where you go). 

It includes noodles, shredded lettuce, mixed steamed veggies, your choice of meat (I had the chicken), a spring roll, and fish beoth/sauce. You dump the broth/sauce over the noodles and veggies and enjoy! I also added extra crushed peanuts and hot sauce for crunch and kick.

Was a wonderfully filling but light lunch. I enjoyed the various textures in the bowl between the crunchy spring, steamed noodles and sweet shredded lettuce.

For around 9$, I recommend this light, healthy lunch, especially on a warm fall/winter day."}
{"text":"Thai Island is Manchu Wok but Thai food. It's great if you get there first thing when they open when everything is fresh. If you get there a little later then things can be hit and miss. For the most part the food is good and they have the standard options that you would expect plus a few more.

If you're in the mood for soup then this might be the better route to go. There's a separate line than the rest of the food so it can be quicker to get in and out."}
