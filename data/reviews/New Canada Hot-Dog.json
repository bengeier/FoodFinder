{"text":"This is one of my \"go to\" places whenever I'm in town.  I used to live around the corner when I was younger.  It was usually the poutine or a pogo with fries.  Lately, I've started to eat their \"steamies\".  It's a steamed dog with mustard, onions and coleslaw.  I still remember when they had those tiny jukeboxes at each of the booths.  Good times, great food."}
{"text":"It is a ritual, a right of passage for a neighbouthood kid growing up in Rosemont. As you headed home from school you would walk in and order an order of ('greasy spoon' or 'casse-croute' depending upon your native tongue) french fries.    The fries themselves are cut on the premises potatoes, blanched, and then refried.  Hot out of the oil and into the bag ready to eat. A sprinkling of salt and vinegar into the brown paper bag which contained your order of fries and you were on your way.  The Montreal steamies are also a staple here.  What is a steamie? It is a steamed hotdog with cole slaw and mustard.    They also make great Montreal style pizza, hot submarine sandwiches, and other working class meals.  This place has been here since 1972 and run by generations of the same greek family ever since. Their success over the years have allowed them to expand the restaurants dining area and their following continues."}
{"text":"This neighborhood diner is a new discovery for me. The diner is clean, the service is friendly and the red leather seats transport you back in time. What I loved was the price of the breakfast! For $5.95+tx, I had an egg, 3 strips of bacon, two pieces of toast with jam, lots of potatoes, 3 pieces fruits and bottomless coffee!! There wasn't anything special about the food, but it was well made and served really fast. I don't remember having brunch for less than $15 in a long time, so this was a nice surprise! I don't think I will make a special detour to come here for breakfast, but if I am in the area and hungry, I would definitely drop by  again."}
