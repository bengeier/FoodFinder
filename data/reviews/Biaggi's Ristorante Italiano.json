{"text":"My husband and I ate here on our first date, so it holds a special place in my heart.  We continue to eat here occasionally when we aren't worried about calories or spending a bit more than usual.  Their soft bread and parmesan/olive oil to dip in is the best!  I particularly like the pasta dishes.  The tirimasu is also delectable.  I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I will say I've never been disappointed in my food.    Elegant Italian eating without being crazy expensive.  The only negative I can say is that, when it is crowded it can get very loud in there and difficult to have a conversation.  Overall, miles better than Olive Garden or Minneci's (sorry local restaurant I wish I liked you!)"}
{"text":"This place was eloquent, classy, proper, fancy, and delicious just the way I like it. Dress nice because you're in for a treat. The servers are professional and know a lot about the cuisine. Everyone had plenty to eat and was very delighted by the whole experience. Finally, a touch of class in Champaign Illinois 61820!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were trying to get a seat at Eno Vino on a Thursday night at 8 pm, but they were packed. We were starving, and decided to give Biaggi's a try.  We shared two pasta dishes: Butternut Squash Ravioli and Lobster Fettuccine--the two most popular pasta dishes, we were helpfully informed by our waiter.    Oh boy.  Let's start with the fettuccine.  The dish was described as \"Black fettuccine tossed with lobster, wild mushrooms and a homemade lobster-cream sauce.\" Sounds delightful. So imagine our surprise when the dish arrived after apparently having been assaulted by a madman with a pepper flake shaker.  The sauce was not merely spicy, but HOT.  As in revisiting-in-the-middle-of-the-night hot.  It also had a ton of scallions--in all, the flavoring was way too aggressive for the mild lobster, and not at all what I thought I was ordering.  If I were to describe the ravioli in one word, it would be NUTMEG.  I'm a big fan of squash ravioli, but not when it tastes more like pumpkin pie.  WAY too sweet for human consumption.  Our waiter seemed perplexed that we did not want to-go boxes for our half-unfinished meal, or the horrendously under-salted bread.  Overall, the service was friendly and impeccable, and the ambiance was nice--but I would not recommend this place for anything resembling authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"The new location is lovely! It's a very beautiful space. We loved the bread they served at the beginning of the meal and the food was amazing. I would not spend the money on the strawberry lemonade again--the menu makes it sound amazing but tasted like strawberry water. Our waiter was very friendly and our overall experience was pleasant! We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars since Biaggi's opened their Champaign location. Always enjoyed the food and received outstanding service. Nice wine list and the bartenders are terrific. Great for date night as well as family time. On a winter night, you can't beat the tall bar tables and cozy atmosphere. One aspect of Biaggi's that I don't think other reviewers covered is their attentiveness to food allergies. My daughter has an anyaphylactic food allergy and Biaggis' is one her favorite restaurants because she knows they will take good care of her."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested Biaggi's along with a couple other restaurants as a place to go for dinner on a Friday night.  We (obviously) chose Biaggi's and made it there just before the dinner rush.     The atmosphere initially seemed semi-formal, given how the customers and waiters were dressed, but as more customers arrived, I learned that this restaurant was very casual.       Our waiter presented us with a basket of bread (like any other Italian restaurant) and prepared a dipping plate for it, which consisted of about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a mountain of parmesan cheese,  and literally a couple flakes of cracked pepper.  If I ever went back, I'd know to ask for only a little cheese, because it was extremely salty and overpowering.       For an appetizer we ordered the Fried Ravioli, which is normally a favorite of mine.  Unfortunately I don't consider it a favorite anymore.  The spinach and ricotta filling was bland, and unfortunately all the ravioli's were literally drowning in a thick cream sauce.  At that point I was just disappointed and hoping that my main entree would make up for the appetizer.     It didn't.     I ordered another personal favorite, chicken marsala with garlic mashed potatoes.  Once again, I was disappointed.  The mashed potatoes were ok, the chicken was ok, the marsala sauce tasted like pure cream.  At this point it was apparent to me that this restaurant likes to hide all the flavors of their foods behind salty, thick, creamy sauces.  I couldn't bring myself to finish the meal.      Because of the quality of the food, I'd say that this chain makes fancy tv dinners.  I'd be willing to bet that these are meals that are prepared elsewhere and just reheated at the restaurant.  Whether or not that is the case, I'm not sure; but that is definitely how our meal tasted.     On a different note, the reason this restaurant got a star at all was due to the service it provides.  Our waiter was excellent at keeping our glasses full and our food arrived in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I just got off the phone with a manager (Rory) who helped me plan a special menu for an upcoming meal. He was extremely helpful and took the time to talk through each dish with me. The service at this restaurant is beyond fantastic...thank you!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. My then-boyfriend (now husband) brought me for lunch on our third date, and I was impressed (well, by him and by the foods I had). Our favorites are: the bread, grilled squid with arugula salad, black fettucine with lobster sauce, and capellini di mare (angel hair pasta with seafood in spicy tomato-based sauce). Why the bread, you may ask? The bread is soo good, we always ask the waitress to give us extra to take home. Just like most Italian restaurants, you dip it in olive oil, black pepper, and permesan cheese, but the combination of the bread and everything else is sooo delicious. And filling, be careful not to eat too much or else you'll be full before the foods arrive. The grilled squid is not always on the menu, but you can always ask your server for it, and they usually will make it for you. The fetuccini with lobster is superb, and quite unique. It's spicy and savoury and creamy. The angel hair with seafood?Good good good (although now I think the one from Tutto Pasta is slightly better and tastier). if you are a student like me, come during lunch hour, because everything is cheaper (though smaller portion, but the lunch portion is big enough for me)."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the front and back of the house. When I asked for a change up from one type of noodle to the other, no problem. When I asked for a half portion vs full, no problem. The wait staff was excellent. They were friendly, quick to deliver drinks, extra bread etc... And lets not forget the food, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Food is decent service is slow and terrible since they changed locations. Disappointing.   Took 10 minutes for someone to even come to table and that was the host after I received no wait service"}
{"text":"Looks like this place has mixed reviews, but I love it!  I always get the shrimp diavolo, it comes with a lighter tomato sauce with veggies in it - yum!  The salads are huge but great.  You must have a reservation for the weekends, and I'd even suggest it during the week because you never know when the U of I has some crazy event going on!  I always dress up to go there but I've seen people in jeans."}
{"text":"Bread is good, everything else is tasteless. The chicken soup is thickened with so much flour that it is hard to move spoon around. The special of the day has tasteless meat mixed with boring sauce plus some chili. Even the kid's mac and cheese was bad. Pasta was hard and had watery cheese.  Dessert is good."}
{"text":"Bruschetta = delicious service = excellent  The rest was nothing to write home about. Tasty, but average as Italian goes. Why aren't there any pasta dishes with vegetables? Most dishes use cream sauce. You can get better quality at Buca di Beppo where you get more for your money.  Then again, it was this or Apple Bee's, and I'd make the same choice again."}
{"text":"This place is great for a date night, only drawback is it's a little expensive. We ordered the goats cheese and beet salad to share, a pizza each and 2 drinks each - came close to $100 incl tip!! It just seems a lot for a chain restaurant.. My self and my boyfriend were here recently, I am not always inclined to go to Italian restaurants - being on gluten free and vegetarian diet, but this place deserves a review for standing out! Researching the menu online beforehand paid off. While we waited our very friendly waiter brought me gluten free flatbread and the pizza was great with mushroom and truffle. They have a separate GF menu so be sure to ask for as you are being seated. I was surprised to see it so busy on a tuesday so if you have a bigger group I would recommend reserving a table. The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting but had great service. Will probably be back, but not too often due to the price."}
{"text":"Went there for a large family dinner. The food was really good. However, the service wasn't great and I am not sure we will be back for a large family dinner. The server seemed anxious to rush us take our plates as we finished. She never brought a dessert menu and instead as we were finished last bites said \"How should i divide the check.\" As we sat for 10-15 minutes longer she came out and seemed flustered and explained that she was leaving her shift and needed us to pay (we had only been there an hour and 15). As a former server, I do understand the desire to collect a tip if the shift is ending. However, this should never happen at a more upscale restaurant and I assume there is a way to collect the tip after the shift. The other issue was that the employees seemed annoyed with our big family of kids and we didn't get a very kid friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Had supper here on Sunday night. Very small selection on the liquor to pick from. Had the chicken Marsala and risotto. My meal was very good. Will be back when in town on business."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Biaggis for a while but it had been one of our favorite places. I loved the filet and thought it was the best in town.  This wasn't the case tonight. We arrived at 5pm and were promptly seated. We then waited for what seemed like forever.  I ordered the filet as usual even though I noticed the price had increased by about 30%!! I could live with that but it turns out that even though the price had increased substantially, the quality had decreased substantially.  The plating did not look as I remember it looking. There was hardly any sauce. The sun dried tomatoes were decimated. There was hardly any asparagus and very few potatoes.  With the substantial price increase I would think they could have maintained or increased the quality.  Biaggis is no longer a preferred destination for us."}
{"text":"We were visiting our son in university town and asked him to select dinner place. Nice Tuscany decor at the entrance ;  we opted to sit outside. Our server, Amy, was friendly and prompt in service. Her cocktail suggestion was superb. We liked our calamari unlike many places where rings are more of batter than meat portion. My salmon risotto was perfect; my little one ordered farfella that he claims to liking it. The university boy picked capalleni which apparently came without scallops and shrimps. Luckily chef remembered the incomplete entree that was served so she brought a bowl of scallops and shrimps. She was facetious about her lack of attention and offered no apologies. Ideally, handkerchiefs are placed on the right side of each patron but we had to ask specifically when we got our appetizer. Food quality was good; lost 1 star due to service ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely TERRIBLE in terms of service. They gave us our food 45 min after we ordered. We then proceeded to tell the manager about our disappointment; instead of helping, the manager yelled at us. I will NEVER go back there. The service is just awful and the manager is SO RUDE"}
{"text":"We went here for a graduation dinner. The wait staff here is great, everyone is so friendly and accommodating. One thing I love at any restaurant is when the server brings over a drink refill before you even ask for one. I know it's a small thing, but it's that kind of attention that makes all the difference. The food was amazing! I had the black fettuccine with lobster and a bit of a chicken salad dish as well. Everything was yummy and came out fast even with a full house on what I assume is a very busy business day.   I definitely recommend it here for a nice dinner whenever you're in Champaign!"}
{"text":"I like the ambience here and the service is wonderful. A perfect place to 'wine and dine'. The bar menu provides a large variety of drink options to start with before we get to dinner, and an exceptional dessert menu to follow up after dinner. Tiramisu is fantastic here. However, the dinner menu lacks much variety (very few options for appetizers), and most of the entrees are pasta/noodle oriented, which i dont enjoy very much. I wouldnt recommend this place, if you dont like pasta/noodles all that much. I stereotypically end up having the Bruchetta Classico (my favorite item in the menu) for an appetizer and the Chelean Sea Bass for an entree whenever i visit this place. It gets one extra star for its bar menu/desserts and excellent service."}
{"text":"Just had another great meal at Biaggi's.  Always a good meal.  Jared was our server and he was very personable and attentive.  Wife and I celebrated her 1st mothers day.  She had the chicken piatti (?), and I went low scale with the pepperoni and mushroom Stromboli.  The only thing that keeps it from a 5 star in my mind is the same menu for the past several years. I realize it is a chain though.  I shouldn't complain, I only go here once or twice a year.  Anyway, highly recommend it. Nice people and good food at fair to decent prices."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pleasant and comfortable.  The service from our waiter, Mark, was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the pork chop, which was well prepared.  My wife ordered the lasagna which was somewhat bland.  For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and tiramisu.  The cheesecake was good, but the tiramisu was a bit over-soggy though still enjoyable.  Overall it was a good experience, and all of the dishes had a lovely presentation.  Just a matter of finding the ones that they do well."}
{"text":"Chef Michael White takes care of business. Every course of our dinner was perfect. The table ordered everything from a white pizza to vegetarian pasta. Everyone loved the service, food, and atmosphere. Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"I had the Rigatoni Alla Bolognese and would definitely order it again.  I'm not sure about the value because the company picked up the tab"}
{"text":"I try to enjoy this place, but every time I think about giving them another chance...*sigh* major disappointment.  But what do you expect, it's definitely NOT homemade Italian food, which I guess no chain can compare to.  And if that is what you're expecting, this is not the place to go.   I guess I can start with things that I have found enjoyable in the past when not given the choice of places to go with a big group.  I had on occasion gotten the capellini di mare and found it acceptable for what it is.  A spicy seadfoodie tomatoey veggie sauce with a few scallops and shrimp and some squid. And a mound of pasta... mostly pasta very little seafood and for I think it was $17... yikes. (Not that you would expect fresh seafood but the shrimp were salty as if they had been but in a brine to take away their old seafood taste)  I also have gotten the wedge salad which tasted fine but was nothing special.  The lobster squid ink pasta is something I regularly got as well.  The kids menu was $7 for a bland \"pizza\". Honestly, I would just recommend to avoid the place completely. I would say the last 5 times (4 too many) throughout the past 2 years the service has been AWFUL.  I've encountered a very rude waitress who insulted the person paying for the meal as she was handing him the check.   Another time, when they were dead and we had been waiting a very long time for our food, I ran to the bathroom with my 3 year old and found her sitting in the back party room with her phone out texting/something who knows!  When I got back to the table our food still hadn't arrived.  Which this doesn't make sense to me because usually there are runners, but maybe not during the day when they are slow?  Anyway.. she finally came out with our food which had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a VERY long time.  I had gotten a half and half pasta/salad.  My pasta had a film over the sauce from sitting and the salad was hot and wilted from sitting on the same plate under the lamp.   Again recently I ended up here when someone else was taking us out.  Two servers came up to us and claimed the other was being trained so they would both be helping us.  I thought great!.. with two we may get semi decent service.  We ordered our food, and when it came out, the pasta the person to my side had ordered came out not as it is supposed to be.  She had ordered the black pasta, which I must say has a texture to it and appeal that a normal boxed linguine does not.  The runner said \"oh.. your server didn't tell you\" and we said no and that the pasta was one of the main components of the dish.  She said nothing more, didn't offer to change it or see if she wanted something else and just kind of wandered away.  Maybe she should have been more up front about how disappointed she was when the server came back to ask how everything was, but oh well, just another nail in the coffin. Bread and pasta are cheap!  I could make any of the dishes they serve, in my own home, for a few dollars and with a lot more taste!  I am done with you Biaggis."}
{"text":"I used to love to go here for lunch during the summer for their iced tea -- it's the best!  The past couple times I've gone for dinner, the whole experience has been a huge disappointment.  HORRIBLE service, cold bread, bland food, and icky iced tea.  The last meal I had (and will ever have) there....  A herd of staff hanging out by the bar, ignoring the customers... Creepy waiter... No bread.  Could we get some bread please?  Still no bread... Penne Porcini = starchy and bland... Ice tea had a really odd, \"off\" flavor... Still no bread... Dirty bathroom... Penne Porcini, later that night = NOT good..."}
{"text":"Exactly the pizza I was looking for. Nice Italian soft-inside crisp-outside thin crust. The best I have tried in CU so far.   I only tried one pasta dish, the taste was good, but too saucy for me.   They give you crispy fresh bread that you dip in oil-herbs-chees mixture as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I would only call this a half step up from Olive Garden authenticity of Italian food. Still heavy and greasy food, but the flavors are alright. Quite expensive for what you get - I am assuming they get away with these prices only because they serve food with Italian origins."}
{"text":"I can only give this restaurant 4 stars, but it's not because of the food. I waited too long to place my order and get my check. It was busy, but you don't get  5 stars unless everything is perfect. I had the \"Ravioli Quattro Formaggi\". 4 different cheeses in homemade ravioli with just enough tomato sauce. Really enjoyed it! I'll be back here each time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The Service was bad and my food was soggy and I hated how expensive it is but all in all it was bad"}
{"text":"Service: B Food: F  Went to Biaggi's for the first time on a friends recommendation. It's possible I ordered the wrong things but our appetizer and food was awful. They even managed to mess up soda - it was very watered down. I'm never going there again.  Stay away from Fried Ravioli and Penne Sardi, if you're forced to go there."}
{"text":"Great staff but food unfortunately was lacking. Perhaps it just so happened that I ordered the \"wrong\" dish (a rather mediocre Farfalle Alfredo) but I never enjoyed their butternut squash ravioli in the past either so... I will give them props for dessert though. The lemon tower cake was luscious and served with the freshest strawberries."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my birthday last year and together, we're a pretty tough to please crowd.  The Good: - The service! We made a reservation for an early dinner (around 5:00pm) and were seated promptly. Our waiter/other waitstaff were very polite and helpful. - The food was also very good! Everyone left pleasantly full and enjoyed their food. - The bathrooms were also nice and clean, which is always a plus.  The Bad: - Nothing!  Overall: - This is a great place for a family meal or a date night. The food is good, and the prices are okay for a more upscale Italian place. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with visiting family and the reviews were pretty much on the mark.  Nice atmosphere with an upscale feel--although the food was not quite up to the level of the surroundings.  Couldn't pinpoint anything bad per se, but there wasn't anything outstanding either.  But the staff was very friendly and great with my 16 month old daughter and 67 year old (and overly talkative) father.  Will probably go back, but it won't go on my top ten list."}
{"text":"One of my favorites and probably the best Italian in C-U. They can do dinner for 2, big groups or anything in between. Had the family-style feast with a group of 25 and everybody was pleased. House salad, Farfalle Alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs all around!"}
{"text":"We went to Biaggi's with a family group of seven celebrate two birthdays on an early Sunday evening.  The place was mostly empty when we arrived.  We stopped at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive and ordered two drinks.  It took more than ten minutes to get the drinks as the bartender excused himself right after we ordered to bring a take out order to someone who had just arrived. Once we got to our table we were greeted by two friendly waitstaff.  Bread was wonderful.  Calamari appetizer was also good.  My Caesar salad arrived with a dead fly on one of the pieces of lettuce.  When I pointed it out to the waiters, they took it immediately and sent the manager over.  He apologized and said that the kitchen was replacing all the lettuce and there would be no charge for the salad and would I still like a salad.  I took a new salad.  No fly on this one.  Caesar dressing was heavy on the garlic, so sharp tasting that my husband wouldn't share.  My scallops with risotto was wonderful.  Two family members had lasagna and said it was okay, but not the best.  Dessert was offered, but we declined as my daughter had baked a cake for the birthdays.  No mention of a restaurant offered birthday dessert was mentioned.  Bill came and the only discount was the free salad due to the fly.  Bill was not split as had been asked for initially. Overall, good food but we really expected better.  We were clearly disappointed that the only discount offered due to the dead fly stuck to the salad was that the salad would be free! A free drink or meal discount would have been more than appropriate.  Also disappointed that there was not an offer to celebrate our birthdays.  We will head elsewhere for Italian and birthday celebrations next time."}
{"text":"I'm glad this restaurant is in the neighborhood, and the food is generally good. But the bartender has been clearing plates and glasses by the top, then serving food, for an hour since I've been here. I'm appalled to see this during cold and flu season, especially.  This is typical, and I wish to see it consistently addressed, and we'd go out to eat more this time of year, if so. I'll be very unhappy if I get sick."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Italian and this place was near my hotel.  Their wine list was not extensive but I did have a yummy cab.  Their bread basket is okay.  I ordered the butternut squash ravioli which was delicious.  Their portions were also large enough to take a doggie bag back to the hotel.    Service was great, I didn't feel like I was isolated because I was dining alone."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade my review after having two disappointing experiences at Biaggi's. We have been there on two occasions when the restaurant was extremely busy and crowded. I don't totally blame the server because it is very hard to keep up with that kind of pressure, but the service was terrible. Our orders got all screwed up-all of them-and we never got refills on our drinks. Food was just OK although a step up from Olive Garden (which isn't saying much.) I won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Came here on a Saturday night with some friends and we were all very impressed. Menu options are numerous from appetizers through the desserts. Prices are very reasonable and in my opinion a little under what I'd expect given the portions and ingredients. We started out with some specialty drinks: I had a Romeo and Juliet, which was a martini with chocolate creme and black raspberry liqueur.. My friend had a Cherry Basil Fresco which everyone agreed was extremely refreshing and had just enough sweetness. We only ordered one appetizer, but it was incredible. We had the lobster and crap dip. For under $9 it was a steal. Good portion and tons of crab and lobster meat. It was put together with a marscapone  cheese and artichoke base. My friends had the Fettuccini and Lobster pasta, I had the Salmon and Shrimp Milanese and my fiance had the special, a Char and Risotto dish which was extremely flavorful. With the exception of the Salmon dish, everything was served in good portion. The salmon dish was a little smaller than expected but the flavor was incredible, especially the shrimp. The entire meal was capped by excellent service from our waitress who's name escapes me. She did a great job of pulling the meal together and making us happy through the entire visit. After visiting here I will probably make this a quarterly year visit. Definitely worth an evening out!"}
{"text":"Am a long time Biaggis fan but this was our first trip to the new location.  New ambiance is good.  Service was good. Food was a great disappointment compared to our many previous visits.  Salmon was over-seared and dry.  Wild boar ragout over pasta was missing both the boar and the ragout.  A large serving of brownish spaghetti!  We will try again out of long time loyalty.  Sure hope the food improves because up scaled ambiance is no substitute for good food."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed this place for a relaxing lunch. Good food, good service, and a warm relaxing atmosphere, especially good in winter when it is dreary outside."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch with friends. The food was pretty good, as usual (I had chicken parmesan and my fiance had an alfredo dish, which he said wasn't that good) but this time the service wasn't as superb. My fiance's silverware was dirty, and my Pepsi tasted flat. I ended up just drinking water.   Our initial waitress mysteriously disappeared after getting our drinks... another waiter took over and said that the other waitress had to \"take off.\" This was kind of confusing, because we saw her waitressing other tables right by us. Plus, I never like it when there are about 5 different people stopping by your table. One guy asked if we wanted more bread, and we said yes, and then he never brought the bread basket back. Different people brought out our dishes... and, nearing the end our waiter kept asking us if we needed anything (we were just sitting there talking), which made us feel like he wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had it been extremely busy and a long wait, but there was hardly anyone there!"}
{"text":"I am in town for Epic training and have been here twice. The food and service has been very good. I love the bread basket. I had the lobster fettuccine and the chicken parmesan. Both were delicious. I also got a cherry cream soda and was very happy with my choice. The second night we shared the donut dessert with ice cream and that was also good. I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"I've been here many times because I work nearby, and this is the only reason I'll go back (if I'm with a group). It's an ok place if you want a regular salad for lunch (beware: house dressing just tastes like oil), but other things I've ordered have been disappointing. I had the saith/couscous dish today, and the fish had no flavor and it was really greasy (almost sent it back and I've done that 2-3 times in my whole life). Other dishes I've had have been similar. My glass and fork had caked on food. Today's lunch experience (which took 2 hours on a workday) prompted me to finally write about Biaggi's. For the prices and the image it projects, it's just not a good place."}
{"text":"Food tasted better before in addition to larger portions before. Service is crappy. My friend and I thought it was funny how every time we go they come so swiftly when they give us our check but we barely see them in the beginning. It's also very pricey for the quality of everything, though probably because they are one of the few decent Italian restaurants in Champaign."}
{"text":"Lets get straight to it.  Plus: Valet parking Cool Interiors Large Variety of  dishes to cater needs of Veg, non-veg & sea food lovers We were a table of 12 but still the order was prompt So-So: Taste  Gut Feeling:  I had a Salmon-Shrimp Milanese - $20.99- which tasted good (not great) and I felt it was little expensive. Overall I felt with a feeling of satiation and thought may be I should come and again and try more foods."}
{"text":"First timer!! Heard rave reviews. So disappointed. Food cold. Luke warm at best. Pasta was hard on the edges. For the price, I won't be back!!! Our server was acting like we were such a bother. So not into us as much as she was to her fellow server. We finally quit asking for anything that she forgot. We travel and go to many high end restaurants,  this was horrible..."}
{"text":"We were helped by Casey and Stacy. And both of them were really helpful and cordial . Good food, great ambience and wonderful ppl to sum it up."}
{"text":"Went on 11/26/16. Food was very good and very good portions. Had pizzas, wild boar spaghetti and split a Cesar salad.  Bar service was ok. Bartenders not very attentive, was not overly busy. We were later in the evening, after 7:30 or so. Wine by the glass from the bar is also pretty warm, too warm. We did an after-dinner drink and didn't have another because the bar staff seemed interested in cleaning up and closing out, even though there were still people to serve.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Biaggi's is a great restaurant and my \"go-to\" place if I have company in town and we want to go out to eat.  I have mostly ordered their specials and have never been disappointed with anything.  I would highly recommend their house salad - the dressing is delicious and it is a decent-sized portion as well.  My favorite thing there is their bread that they serve - the one cut in strips.  The waiters seem to know the dishes and wines well, as most of them were able to recommend a good one to go with my meal.  Another great thing about Biaggi's is their gluten-free menu.  My husband needs to eat gluten-free and has really enjoyed their dishes.  Also, it seems quite rare that an Italian place has a gluten-free menu!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot.  I've been here a few times.  I tried the Chilean sea bass twice. and the 1st time it was pretty good.  The second time I had it though, it was very undercooked in the middle, so I sent it back and it took a long time for it to return.  The other entrees they have are pretty normal of what you'd expect.  No real exotic drinks either, pretty straight forward.  Not a bad place and I would go there again, but I would never suggest it when asked where I want to eat."}
{"text":"The dipping sauce!!!! MMMMM and the winner here was that they are able to bring you a gluten free option if you need it to dip in the delicious olive oil before your meal. This place is semi casual, but does not seem like a place you absolutely cant dress up too much for."}
{"text":"They charged us extra for a salad without asking, spilled our water and lost my credit card during the payment progress. Don't fall for the soup or salad question."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant.  Their pasta is always good, and our waitress was awesome.  There is small outside patio. I always enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Favorite.  Delicious.  Love the scallops over risotto.  My husband and I usually split a house salad.  Always excellent service."}
{"text":"We hosted a wedding shower at Biaggi's last night and it was fantastic! To our surprise they seated us in the Wine Room. The service from Spencer & Kelsey was exceptionally friendly, efficient and professional. The food was great. Try the stromboli & antipasto trio. Biaggi's allowed us to bring our own cake which they were happy to cut and serve. Thank you so much Hattie & staff. It was a perfect evening!    Sue S"}
{"text":"Good salads, great lasagna (filling, but not heavy), seafood is hit and miss. I had a striped bass that was not vey fresh once, but did well with other selections. They do not serve normal iced tea. I assume their phrou-phrou fruit flavors come from a packaged mix, but I prefer my tea tea-flavored. Limited wine list. The soup selections are also about as imaginative as Olive Garden's. Nice interior feel for a strip mall restaurant. Not all chains are bad. This is a decent one and not overpriced."}
{"text":"Never had a waiter ask me about dessert 2 bites into my entree! Then come back 5 min later to ask to take the order and then be miffed when we stated that we were not ready to make that decision.talk about strange and pushy.  We have come here and always been satisfied with the service but this was very unpleasant onward. Won't be rushing back soon"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The service when we went was passable, but only from the waitress. The kitchen delayed all our food because they messed up a steak (seriously, how do you mess up a steak?) which meant that everything we ate was cold. From what I can tell it wouldn't be bad warm- I had the stromboli, which was passable as is- but when you mess up that badly, it's hard to make fans.  Also, unrelated, the wine seemed rather expensive. Maybe that's just me, though."}
{"text":"There is only ONE reason to eat at a chain -- predictable and relatively consistent food from location to location.  What a disappointment!  While recovering from the flu, I ordered carryout, thinking a bowl of Biaggi's Sherry Tomato Soup would really hit the spot.  I have had the soup before and enjoyed it as a pleasant variation on the classic cream of tomato soup.  Seems someone thinks Sherry is Tabasco sauce and rendered the soup uneatable!  Since it was carry out there was nothing to be done -- but never visit this chain again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Champaign. Eggplant parm is the best I have ever had. Even the cheesecake factory doesn't compare. Discovered the fried ravioli. It can be it's own meal, it is unlike any fried ravioli you have ever had. Before becoming a vegetarian, chopped chicken salad and fettuccine lobster were my fav's. Come for the amazing bread and stay for the amazing entrees."}
{"text":"While it is a chain, they do a fairly good job of hiding it.  Having heard a lot about this place from friends, I finally decided to give it a try.  My friend and I made a reservation for 5 in accordance to the warnings from friends that this place can get really busy.  When we arrived though, there were only a handful of businessmen at the bar, and the dining area was completely vacant.  By the time we left though, barely an hour later, this place was completely packed so I would definitely recommend a reservation unless you plan on eating an early dinner.  They have a nice selection of breads for you to munch on while waiting for your entree, but despite the fact there were only a few other diners, the food came out rather slowly and my dish was lukewarm (I had the Chicken Cannelloni).  It was pretty good, but would've been better if I had gotten it hot.  The ambiance could be romantic I suppose, if that's what you're looking for, but if you really want to impress your date, I suggest going somewhere downtown Champaign/Urbana.  There's a mixture of people who go there, from casual college students out for a nicer meal with their parents to businessmen and women grabbing a drink after work.  Overall, not a bad place to have dinner.  The service was very good (nice, attentive waiters), the food's pretty good, and it still allows for easy conversation despite the fact that it gets very busy.  3-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Three business colleagues had a dinner. The menu is quite large, the atmosphere nice with no loud music at the background. We had some wine, calamari, chicken parmesan and chicken cannelloni. The entries were tasty and fairly large, the service was pleasant and attentive. Its probably not the best restaurant I'v ever been to, but it's certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"You know how people always say, \"I really wanted to like this place, BUT...\"  in reviews? Well, I really DIDN'T want to like Biaggi's because I'm an uppity snob about going to chain restaurants. I fully recognize that I should really get over myself, because I had a great experience.   We went to Biaggi's  for my Master's degree graduation dinner. It was one of the few places that was not downtown (which we wanted to avoid due to graduation crowds) that could take a reservation on short notice. Plus, my mom likes it.   Everything about the dinner was very nice, and I can't say too much about the food  that hasn't already been said. I can reiterate that  the Fettuccine with Lobster is delicious. You should try it.   A nice thing about Biaggi's is that you can order any pasta entree as a \"small\" size for about half the price. I took advantage of this because at most Italian-American restaurants, the portions are so huge that you can feel like you're eating for an hour and not even make a visible dent in the pile of pasta on your plate. My \"small\" portion was just right for me...especially since they give you delicious free bread, which the waitress was awesome about making sure was refilled throughout the meal.  I've actually been thinking about that Lobster Fettuccine all day...I might have a new addiction!"}
{"text":"We were in town for work and decided to try Biaggi's because of the close proximity to our hotel. The food was amazing but the service left us with instant regret. Our server was too busy entertaining a larger party to attend to our table. He came by and asked if the food was okay and before we could answer he would disappear. We had to look for him just for a glass of wine and it wasn't busy. No excuses for poor service especially when it's not busy. Pay as much attention to your smaller parties and your reward will be plentiful."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! I love the capellini di mare and the desserts are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice cozy atmosphere, The staff is great.  This is in my opinion one of the best places in Champaign to eat. The talapia is yum, booze is strong, it's a good date night place, my hubby and I always go here when we are in town."}
{"text":"Food is relatively expensive, but of dubious quality. The only time I ate here, my entree came out cold. Real cold. Eating-straight-out-of-fridge cold. I told the server, and in about 5 minutes, I got the exact same plate back, microwaved. I know this because I took a bite and that bite was still there. Even after heating to a palatable temperature, it was still underwhelming. My dining companion got her food hot, but she wasn't impressed either. If I were getting the food for a steal I might let it slide, but the prices are too high for that crap."}
{"text":"Three words... Butternut squash ravioli!!! Amazing! They are a little but more on the pricey side but it is sooo worth it! Perfect for a date night or anniversary. My fiancé had something that I cannot spell but it was delicious and smelled good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was ok but generic. The caprese had refrigerated tomatos.  The beet salad was good.  The risotto with the short ribs was terrible. It's a chain. What do you expect."}
{"text":"My favorite chain restaurant.  Reasonable prices, enormous portions and great service.  Parking is pain, but that's true for all business in this location."}
{"text":"I had just had the most lovely rehearsal dinner here.  Jasmine was a pleasure to work with and her staff on the night of the event were awesome.    The food was absolutely delicious.  Everything was perfect!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my wife's favorite restaurants.  We normally go for special occasions. We love the food,  great service, and the nice dining environment. We try to go earlier than the normal dinner crowd so we can find a parking spot in the small lot and to also be seated right away. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance. Priced right. No surprises here except for the fried ravioli appetizer, magnifique!"}
{"text":"Jon was our waiter, best service out of all the times we've gone. Food is excellent too"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place, so finally went there a couple of months ago. It's a chain but I have only ever seen it 2 times. Anyways, I had lasagna and my husband had some kind of chicken parm thing. He really liked his. Mine was good as well. Nothing super amazing for the price, but it was definitely good quality food and service, and beats the hell out of Olive Garden. Think of it like a nicer, more quality Olive Garden lol. I'd go here again I'm sure but just haven't gotten around to coming back."}
{"text":"We came here with a teen group of about 40. Our leader asked if the bus driver could have his meal comped (many restaurants offer that for groups of 20 or more). The hostess checked with a supervisor who said yes. Once we were seated, a manager approached and told our leader no. Right away that set the tone for management's competence. Bread with olive oil was very good. Salad was great. The taste of the food was ok. The alfredo sauce was more like parmesan milk. No creaminess in it at all. Although we had lunch portions, the lasagna for several members of our group were so small, that an old lady in a nursing home could have finished the whole thing. Yet, other members received a good sized piece of lasagna. Oh, drnks. They don't serve regular iced tea. Only raspberry iced tea which can be served through the Pepsi dispenser.   Now for dessert. We were allowed two desserts for the group. The group voted for chocolate cake and creme brulee several weeks in advance. Keep in mind, also, there were four tables with 6-7, a table of 3, and one table with 11 or 12. We were brought platters with 3 pieces of tiramisu and 2 pieces of lemon cake. The server checked, and those were the choices that were written on the service sheet for the kitchen. Even though our leader checked her email and the cake and creme brulee were clearly confirmed by management of Biaggi's, they did not make it right to correct the dessert choice. I questioned the platters of 5 pieces for our larger tables. The server told me she even questioned it, and she was told to serve it that way. So, members at each table had to go to other tables to get their respective desserts. AND, even though our group numbered over 40, we were only served 35 desserts.  In full disclosure, the restaurant offered several gift cards for the errors which will be donated to the school group for used in raffles. I hope I don't win.  Pros: Our servers were fantastic. Very accommodating, quick, and pleasant. The decor was lovely, and the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here in March. The service and food were impeccable. Very impressed!  We started off with bruschetta and bacon wrapped dates. Both tasted very fresh and were delicious.  We followed with the house salad and then had chicken marsala and lasagna for entrees. So much food!  The experience was seamless and I was impressed with the coordination of the staff."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place.  Big menu tries to be all things to all people.  Servings are large, some compensation for the fact that the food is good, but not great.  Additionally, the place can get very crowded and noisy.  It's a nice space, but I wish they would invest in some acoustical treatment - basically it's wood all around, and that gets loud!  I do think the prices are fair, and generally the service is pretty good.  This is a decent choice for people not looking to spend a fortune, with people who like a wide variety of items."}
{"text":"We like to go here when we want to have a more upscale meal at place that's still kid friendly.   The food is good. We've had a lot of different entrees and they're pleasant but nothing too memorable. We usually leave saying, \"That was good,\" but if you asked us what we had a few days later we probably couldn't tell you. It's the atmosphere and reasonable prices that keep us coming back.   Kids love drawing on the butcher paper on the tables (so do we) and they love the small, complementary fruit and veggie dish that comes out early to help occupy their time.   We (the adults) like the fairly interesting menu, the bread (dipped in olive oil) and a decor that is on the verge of being \"chain-like\" but still manages to make it feel like \"date night\".   Never a problem with service - although never any service that really \"wowed\" us either. Although we did book one of the back rooms for a birthday party and the staff was attentive and helpful.   Kind of middle of the road, but reliably good is how I'd describe Biaggi's."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our meals at Biaggi's. The new location is a big improvement as parking is now readily available. Best kept secret in Madison? Their pizza is absolutely terrific. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ambience is nice and romantic, staff is very nice and friendly, food was pretty good. I came here for lunch and order one of their specials. My friend ordered a lobster fettuccine dish which... well, the lobster was dry and really fishy tasting. I kept wondering if it came from a can...? Anyway, my dish was amazing! It's some sort of tortellini and it was amazing! The staff waitstaff was so nice and friendly. Their coffee was amazing and their bread was awesome!!! Of course I'd come here again! We went around lunch and it wasn't swamped but there were quite a few people there. The food came quick and was not cold! I like this place a lot and would definitely recommend having lunch here with a few colleagues!"}
{"text":"Being Italian-American and cooking my own Italian food, I don't often dine in Italian restaurants.  This occasion was a luncheon to honor my staff for their continued efforts and they wanted Biaggi's.  We were a party of ten and the service was prompt and courteous and friendly.  The bread placed on the table was okay and the olive oil and cheese was of modest quality.  I started with the Bacon Wrapped Dates (who can resist bacon) and they were quite good.  Nice blend of salty and sweet and the bacon perfectly done.  Followed that with the Stuffed Pork Loin that was served with asparagus spears and garlic mashed potatoes.  All were nicely done.  Everyone at the table had something different and all enjoyed their meals.  One person ordered a half size order of Spaghetti Marinara which was ample.  Can't imagine a full sized one.  All the portions were of good size.  I opted for Bananas Foster for dessert and it was just okay, nothing remarkable.  Prices were reasonable, the ambiance comfortable and inviting, noise level was moderate.  Second Visit: Went to dinner here tonight and it didn't start off well. I was seated and then ignored.  I finally asked the hostess if they intended to provide me with a server.  One was provided, a very capable and sweet young woman named Cara who took good care of me the rest of the evening. I started with the Bacon Wrapped Dates that made such an impression on me during my first visit.  The bacon was a bit underdone this time but still tasty.  I ordered the Chicken Piemontese and it was okay, lacking seasoning.  The asparagus again nicely done and the roasted potatoes done well.  Treated myself to dessert tonight.  Ordered some espresso and a glass of Sambuca, which surprisingly came in the traditional Italian way with three coffee beans (Sambuca con la mosca = Sambuca with the flies).  It is said that the beans represent health, happiness, and prosperity. Nice touch.  Had planned to have the Lemon Tower Cake but had a mental lapse and instead ordered the cannoli, which had a nice, crisp shell and nice garnish, but the filling was now what I am accustomed to.  As I finished, Jamie, a managing partner, came over and engaged me in conversation about the food, etc.  He was very pleasant and courteous, gave me his card, and told me to let him know of my next visit and we'd talk food and wine.  I don't think he knew of my \"connections\" so I assume the gesture was genuine.  I will take him up on the offer.  He showed rispetto."}
{"text":"I do not consider myself a food snob, I am just as happy getting a Wendy's 1/4 lb. cheeseburger as I am trying some new food fad.  I do however expect for a restaurant to do their very best at what it is they do.  And Biaggi's does not do Italian any better than Olive Garden and does so as at an over-inflated price.  I really do not like to give low ratings.  I try my best to find the silver lining in most things but the only silver lining at Biaggi's is the atmosphere.         I had several friends that gushed about the food and how Biaggi's is one of the best restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area.  I think I need to find a new class of friends after trying Biaggi's.       The wait was not bad for a Wednesday night without reservations.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere of Biaggi's is very nice, white linen table cloths, candles, sturdy table and chairs.   We were presented with a basket of sliced Italian bread and dipping oils after we were seated and it was a nice presentation.        I ordered stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and they were not bad.  They were swimming in oil but if you used the Italian bread to sop it up, they were really very tasty.  I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Oreganata and my SO ordered the Sea Scallop Risotto.  Disclaimer here:  I did not know that Biaggi's was a chain restaurant until after our visit.       The main entrees took a while to come out and I had finished my Caesar salad and mushrooms and was eyeing my husbands bread when they finally did come out.  The salads that came with dinner were large and the lettuce was fresh and crispy.  The Caesar dressing tasted like Kraft but it's salad so I'm not really complaining.   My Garlic Shrimp Oreganata tasted like Chef Boy-Ar-Dee tossed with salad shrimp.  It was lukewarm and terrible.  My husbands Sea Scallop Risotto was also lukewarm and the scallops were few and far between.  The Risotto was actually good and they did put plenty of \"lump\" meat crab in the dish.  For the time it took them to microwave these frozen meals (and you can tell) I would have expected them at least to be hot.       It is a shame that the food was sub-par because the atmosphere is definitely elegant and much nicer than taking your loved ones to Olive Garden (which I love, remember no food snobbery here!)    The fact that this is a national chain restaurant is equally disappointing:  the meh food is now nationwide!         If you are looking for authentic Italian, this is about Italian as Pizza Hut.  Try Minneci's or  or even Manzella's.  If your looking for atmosphere, they have a nice wine and liquor list and enjoy a few drinks but I cannot recommend the food.  And I definitely did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Very good!  I'm in town for work and was happy to find this great Italian restaurant.  Bread was excellent as well as the eggplant parm!  Skip the house salad, it was a $6 add-on, too big to be a side-salad and smothered in dressing."}
{"text":"Less check in's here for me--according to Swarm/FourSquare I have been here more than 125 times, with the majority of those experiences being very good.    Thanks for a good run. FACTS: I started coming here in 1999 when it opened. This was after making several trips from Champaign to the Bloomington location--Good Times and  Great Food with Friends...the business was built on the ethic of solid food and exceptional service. I personally knew most of the 'opening' management staff in Champaign....and I am still connected  with several of them.  Things have changed and not for the better!  On a regular basis I eat here 2-3 times a week. Yes, that is a lot. But, in the past I have appreciated the convenience and location to work. No more passing over the the lack of constancy with food and service. This evening we were served cold/warm soup, cold pasta, cold under cooked vegetables (that the manager calmed was due to a menu change). With tonight's experience I doubt I will ever go back.   Cold food, under cooked food, and an arrogant manager. No Thanks."}
{"text":"I might be Biaggi's biggest fan!  Whenever family comes to visit U of I, I always suggest going to Biaggi's.  I would definitely recommend the Fettuccine with Lobster, it has a hint of spiciness and the seafood is always on par-not to mention the huge food portions you get.  I have been here in both small and large groups and been happy with my meal and the service every time. Biaggi's lives up to the Italian \"family style\" restaurant, but with a finer dining service.  I can't wait to be back for great wine, pasta and bread!"}
{"text":"Love the new location, Biaggi's! Way brighter and more inviting. The white-washed brick contrasted against the dark wood and earth tones is far from the dingy feel of their junction road location. I especially like the accent light fixture in the front - a wooden beam with industrial exposed string lights.   We came for a late lunch and were one of the few tables. A little disconcerting for an established restaurant, but hey it's a new location. Our waiter was friendly and prompt throughout the meal!   I ordered the Alaskan salmon sandwich, served with sweet potato fries and a cucumber-onion salad. The meal took around 25 minutes to arrive, but there was plenty of fresh focaccia with Parmesan and olive oil to tide us by. My sandwich was to die for. The salmon was so moist, and the whipped feta was a texture combination I'm unfamiliar with. The sweet potato fries were crispy and delish!   My only wish is that they would have had the patio chairs out. Even with the view of a parking lot, the string lights overhead the patio make for a nice meal spot. Thanks for the upgrade, Biaggi's...we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a recent resident of Madison and my boyfriend had been wanting to take me here for awhile.  I was nervous at first because I felt we were under-dressed but while the restaurant and staff are more high class, the patrons were casually dressed.  We both started with drinks and off course the bread which I thought was to die for.  Our drinks were also good and not too overpriced (Moscato and a Cherry Basil drink).  We started with the calamari which is served with two different sauces and overall was not bad.  The sauces were definitely the best part.  The only thing off-putting about the dish was that there were a couple pieces that were actual squid tentacles and neither of us could stomach to really look at them, much less eat them.  For an entree, I had the potato and parmesean crusted tilapia and what else can I say but YUM.  The couscous that it came with was not my favorite, but the fish itself was amazing.  It was perfectly cooked and the sauce that came with it was fantastic.  They need to put more sauce with the fish though!  We finished with Creme Brulee which is my favorite dessert and Biaggis did it justice.   Definitely a restaurant worth visiting in my opinion, but if you want a full three course meal, be prepared to spend a bit of money."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant, much better than an Olive Garden or other run of the mill place. They do a good job. I do recommend asking the wait staff what they prefer for food, because they typically have agreat recommendations."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place while I was visiting Madison. I was hesitant because it's a chain but she highly recommended. I regret not just yelping for an Italian restaurant in Madison. The food wasn't that great and the service was OK. I'm tired of Italian restaurants throwing noodles and sauce together and calling it an Italian dish. Lessoned learned....I'll stick to yelping restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this place. Being from California, i found this place very reasonable and upscale the server definitely deserves 5 stars for outstanding services. he was attentive, got our drink and bread refills right away, kept us abreast of our order status, shared tons of friendly conversations and made  recommendation from the menu.  I hope they open a restaurant in California as i can't wait to try out there Chilean Sea bass again. Other people on my table ordered Shrimp Milanese and Fettuccine with Lobster. Everyone left with happy tummies and big smiles which is expected out of any excellent dining experience"}
{"text":"I've only gone here a couple times. Once week over ten years ago as a student and more recently with my in laws. I thought the food was phenomenal and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Got seated at 7:17pm and it's 8:07pm as I write this review and we have yet to even receive our appetizers. We haven't heard a peep from our servers as to what is going on. The tables around us who were seated before us have also not received their food. I understand it's a busy night but waiting nearly an hour and still haven't received our appetizers is a little ridiculous.   Will see if the food is worth the wait..."}
{"text":"I am in town on business and I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks. The food is really good and the staff is very attentive. I like the atmosphere. The food isn't just the normal \"Italian\" food offerings. They have a few unusual things which make this place better in my book.  The bread they serve is great because they serve both a normal Italian bread and a focaccia.   The first night I ordered the Chicken Pietro which was amazing. It was really one of the better chicken dishes I have ever ordered. I didn't want the vegetables that came with the dish and they had no problems substituting then for a different vegetable medley.    The second night I ordered the Salmon and Shrimp Milanese. Again, it was very tasty, and the risotto it came with was truly delicious.  I was very pleased with both of my meals and if I am every around a Biaggi's again, I will try to eat dinner there."}
{"text":"Consistently good across the whole menu.  Staff is good with children."}
{"text":"For a chain, this place is not bad at all. Dont get me wrong, I have nothing against restaurant chains. In fact, they are pretty good sometimes because you know there is going to be consistent ambiance and you will not be in for a surprise, there is bound to be a regular dish off the menu that you like and always order and so on. We went to Biaggi's for dinner. After we were seated, a friendly waiter came up to us and while he was greeting us, explaining what the menu of the day was, he was preparing a dressing of olive oil with cheese and pepper on a small plate simultaneously (talk about multitasking..). After taking our orders for appetizers, warm bread was served. There were two types of bread- one was a regular bread, the other one was.. i dont remember actually. My husband got a soup - vegetable soup and it was extremely tasty! For main course, I got the penne sardi without the chicken and my husband got the eggplant parmiagana. The penne sardi turned out be the best penne I have ever had so far. With the flavor of breadcrumbs and garlic with a hint of tomato creamy sauce, this was absolutely great! And, after getting to know the fact that they were a chain, i was pleasantly surprised, since the overall experience of service, food was way beyond expectation compared to any other chain. They have a good selection of deserts. But their main course is so filling that you end up taking the food home and leave without tasting the deserts. They have a good selection of wine too and usually, there are suggestions available for pairing with your food as well.  When you enter the restaurant, you will find a lot of business cards on a table. These happen to be the business cards of the different chefs working in the kitchen. I found this pretty neat :) The downside of this place is the food is a little over priced. But I would highly recommend this place for italian food."}
{"text":"the lobster spaghetti only have 5 tinny piece lobster in the bowl, and the spaghetti are uncooked"}
{"text":"Excellent service from our waiter...forgot his name..Grant? He was extremely polite and kept telling my group we had good questions which was pretty funny. He was also on top of bringing our bread and refilling our water.   Food was delicious. I did not expect my seafood to be so big too. The amount and quality is worth the price, at least for the seafood pasta I got.   The olive oil/pepper/cheese mix for our bread was very good! The only thing I wish for is the bread to be warmer when it is served to it. It was a little cold, if not plain temp.   I will come again!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, period. My ex-girlfriend and I used to go there on special occasions and they never disappoint.  I have had several dishes there, seafood, chicken, as well as their appetizers and they were all incredible.  I will continue to go there, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good.   In fact, the grilled salmon salad was so good that I didn't even need to use any of the salad dressing.  Check the bottom of the menu.  You can get 1/2 orders of the pasta.  My wife had the chicken cannolini and she really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Biaggi,s is not actually fine dining, yet the ambiance hints towards such. The olive oil that they use as a dipping sauce is top grade. I have tasted some dipping oils and they are not created equal. The waiter was very polite and accommodating to how I actually desired a warming of my bread for dipping.   I have a new found favorite cake! The Lemon Tower cake is off the charts!"}
{"text":"Sunday night summer dinner with my daughter and husband. Attentive service, good food, pretty much what we expected from a chain Italian restaurant. I ordered the roasted beet salad which was a large enough portion for a meal. My husband had the lasagna and thought it was good. Daughter ordered the pepperoni pizza which was big enough to take half of it home for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"For reasons that surprise and depress me, Madison's Far West Side restaurant scene consists almost entirely of corporate/chain operations. For funkier and more imaginative options, one has to look elsewhere (although locally operated--and pricey-- Eno Vino is in the same strip mall as Biaggi's).  But among the chain operations, Biaggi's is one of the best--a lively, generally bustling operation with a variety of reasonably good Italian-style menu options, Not the most imaginative, not the most intimate, but a generally well run and satisfying mildly upscale place for a nice meal with friends. In some ways, this is the Italian parallel to P.F. Chang's (see my review).  Biaggi's has sustained some menu setbacks in recent months, with several of our more distinctive favorites disappearing from its menu offerings. Last night we discovered that its regionally unique espresso lamb porterhouse was gone. An early favorite, a pasta dish with smoked salmon and a vodka cream sauce, was an earlier casualty. The best of their bread offerings disappeared a few months back. I've spoken with the manager--a friendly and accommodating fellow--and these decisions seem to be made at the corporate level, with little flexibility for local tastes. That is too bad--a further homogenizing of menu options, with fewer distinctive items appealing to other than common denominator tastes.  All that said, Biaggi's remains a tasty and pleasant option for a reasonably priced neighborhood meal. Reservations are recommended on busy nights (one can usually call ahead half an hour or an hour before desired meal time and avoid the worst of the lines). Bring earplugs and/or hearing aids--things have gotten quite noisy on busy nights."}
{"text":"I just left this place attending our annual office holiday luncheon.  I WILL NEVER EVER EEEEVER EAT OR REFER ANYONE to eat at this place EVER.  The service was bad. They had us crammed into a table with 10 people right by the server station. Took FOREVER bringing our food.  The waitresses attitude STUNK and my food was uncooked.  I sent it back and by the time it did come everyone was done eating and I just had them put it in a box for me.  NEVER AGAIN!! NO!"}
{"text":"This was our FAVORITE place to go when visiting my sister at U of I. Relatively reasonably priced but delicious Italian food (Olive Garden who??). I loved the pasta/sausage/goat cheese dinner (sorry, blanking on name), and bread with olive oil, pepper and parmesan cheese has never tasted as good as it did when I first learned about it here. I know there are other sites near me, and I need to think of an excuse to go!"}
{"text":"Rare is the occasion where not only does everybody like what they ordered, but everybody likes what everybody ELSE ordered as well -- but that was exactly the type of meal we had at Biaggi's! Everything was delicious, from the bread to the bacon-wrapped dates to all of our entrees (two different types of cannelloni, a stromboli, and garlic oregenata chicken). Plus, the portion sizes were very generous. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came for an early dinner, and were seated right away.  Manual was our server, and he was attentive and knowledgeable.  He offered great suggestions on wine, entrees and dessert.  The meal was well paced with sufficient but not overlong time between courses.  A fine establishment with a great server."}
{"text":"A slightly upscale Olive Garden. So, if you love Olive Garden, then you'll probably like Biaggi's. Service is fine, food quality is okay. I will eat here when I have picky, non-adventurous eaters with me. Otherwise, I avoid it."}
{"text":"Food is good, friendly staff. However, would not recommend for a date. Very loud, tables are close together, and children are running around. Staff seemed overwhelmed at times and it took forever to have a simple dinner."}
{"text":"Resistance is futile.  You will eat and love everything on the menu.  I started with the 1lb of muscles and was blown out of my clam shell.  Oh yea the house Kiona cab is excellent, one mire please.  Then it was on to the crispy fresh lettuce wedge, another home run!  Er ah more wine please of the same 2003 Washington state vintage,  main dish was simplicity, spaghetti and meatballs, but the sauce was perfect.  Can't wait for the next dad daughter vist, as this will be at the top of grazing list!"}
{"text":"The hype is real. Best sit down place for Italian ive found in champaign. I got taken here for a pre interview dinner. We we were served family style and I polished off almost all the dishes since no one wanted to be that guy that ate everything. I really didn't want the job so I just came to eat all the food.   Needless to say I didn't get the job but I found a great restaurant. Its reasonably priced for italian food but I couldn't eat there very much cause I was a poor college student. I wished I could have ate there more though. Honestly its actually pretty cheap for the quality but my student loans barred me from eating there too much. Don't be like me and regret eating at this fine restaurant people"}
{"text":"For a chain, this is one of the better selections in Madison. I have been to Biaggi's on several occasions (both lunch and dinner). I have always had a great experience and good food.   The bread is amazing and probably what sets Biaggi's apart from other places. You receive two different types of bread, one soft and one hard. There is EVOO at the table along with parm. cheese and pepper. This makes for a great dipping mixture.   I have tried a few things, however, I keep coming back to the eggplant parm. It is fresh, soft and perfectly portioned. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Close to my home and with plenty of parking, this Biaggi's never leaves me hungry. All the Italian food prepared there has been excellent and the menu has plenty of options if you don't know what you want to eat far in advance. Although the prices seem a few bucks more than I'd value each menu item, this is more than made up for by their giant and varied breadbasket. If you're not limiting carbohydrates, it's almost impossible not to save half your entree for later after filling up on bread."}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised when we went here a couple of days ago. The menu has been changed and streamlined, and it includes some really nice dishes. My wife and I both loved our entrées, and the service was kind and fast. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"We went to Biaggi's to surprise one of my friends on her birthday. There were about 20 of us there and the wait staff did a great job making sure our bread baskets and drinks stayed filled. I had the eggplant parmesan and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"I've had dinner and lunch here. It is nice for Champaign, certainly but frankly I didn't like the food. We had the shrimp and crab canneloni which I hated and swapped with my husband's pietro, which had an overpowering sauce. Service was good and ambience too."}
{"text":"Really like this restaurant.  Attentive staff, nice atmosphere and delicious food that is reasonably priced, especially given the size of the portions.  Menu selections were plentiful and obviously prepared Italiano.  The small house salad is a meal in itself and a great mix of vegetables and balsamic dressing.  It was my first time here, but you could tell that there was a group of regulars."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night..the restaurant was about 1/2 full. Finally our waiter showed up. His command of ENGLISH was terrible. All four of us kept saying..\" What?\".  We ended up ordering from the Menu and taking our chances.  This has got to be one of the worst experiences ordering dinner that we have experienced. We waited an enormous amount of time before our appetizers showed up.  We asked for additional plates, which never arrived. After 20 minutes,  I asked another server if our waiter had left...she kindly rounded up our order and the Waiter with absolutely no command of English came to the table. Calamari was very good...did not care for the Butternut Ravioli was not so good....there is a walnut and syrup sauce that reminded me of pancake syrup. Really needs some work on the wait staff here..."}
{"text":"This time lobster fettuccine seems to have had much of the lobster removed prior to the dish arriving at my table.  Worse, timing was poor despite relatively low volume.  Drink took forever...arriving after my soup!  Overall somewhat disappointing now."}
{"text":"Our Biaggi's experience was absolutely terrible.  From the service to the food we were incredibly disappointed.  We were served our appetizers about 5 minutes before we received our drinks.  The tomato soup was extremely acidic.  Our entrees were then brought out before our appetizers were even cleared away, and we had to hold our own appetizer plates for the server to \"switch plates with him.\"  The entrees were terrible and for the quality were certainly overpriced.  The eggplant parmigiana was clearly cooked several hours, if not a day before.  It was not at all crispy.  The rigatoni bolanese was supposed to have  tomato cream sauce, but there was no sauce to be seen.  Our server then came over, while I still had a piece of bread in my hand and was eating my food, and had almost a full glass of wine left and said, \"do you guys want a couple boxes?\"  We said yes, thinking that he would bring us two boxes, but at that point he took our plates away (while I was obviously still eating).  I am fine with taking the plates away to box them up, but that should be stated clearer because I would have said, \"No, I'm still eating.\"  The server then asked us if we would also like for him to box up our extra bread.  We said yes.  When we got home and opened our leftovers the next day, we found that he had not packed the bread.  We will not be returning to Biaggi's.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Served with plastic sheet inside the food,  though they apologized and replaced  when informed and gave 5$ off on the bill I don't frequent here anymore."}
{"text":"Always great!  Whether we stop in for a light lunch or supper the service and food are always great!  Calamari and Wedge salad are great.  If you ask they will make a special donut for dessert, the sorbets are also excellent.  Nice place to take a date or celebrate just the two of you or a whole family.  Always a few beers on tap and a good selection of wine.  Bread and oil on the table, lots of friendly wait staff.  I really enjoy the Ziti."}
{"text":"Biaggis never disappoints. The food is always right on point, as is the service, and lots of yummy wines/martinis. The only issue is that Biaggis tends to be a smaller place with a huge following. On game nights, proms, graduations, and moms/dads weekends the restaurant becomes horribly packed and loud. The servers all do a great job to accommodate everyone. I'd recommend for the weekends such as graduation to make reservations months in advance. A nice perk is that Biaggis does rent out rooms. I love the outdoor seating in the summer too. I'm sad I only have 1 year left at U of I. Definitely will have to get my fill of Biaggis!"}
{"text":"I have a long history with Biaggi's restaurant, going all the way back to when they built the first one in Bloomington.  That place was about 100xs better than the one they built in Champaign, but only for this reason-- the Biaggi's in Bloomy had a... the best way to describe it was \"module\", where they had all these incredible salad ingredients lined up.  You walked up to the beginning (sort of like a Subway setting, only huge metal bowls of fresh ingredients, not small plastic bins/crocks), and the person at the counter would grab a fresh (clean) metal bowl.  You'd start out with your choice of lettuces/spinach/etc., move on to toppings (with more than a dozen to choose from), and then finally get a home made (right there in front of you) dressing that... let me tell you, was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  So amazing!  But, that was the Bloomington store, of course.  Biaggi's in Champers was different from the get go.  A GIANT room constructed from a wooden polymer that was designed to cut down on noise and echoing!  Super smart.  Not sure it really helped, like a lot of people will often complain, the place is like an echo chamber, but... acoustics were a concern from the start.  Biaggi's had always prided themselves on being Southern Italian.  That meant that you'd never catch them with a Fetuccini Alfredo on their menu.  I got chewed out for asking if they ever did one, once, at this location. =P  It was during a business dinner, too, so it was good and embarrassing! =P  But it appears, via their online menu (that they do them, now =P  Gee, thanks for that, Biaggi's!)  With the Southern thing, though, you always get a delicious italian bread at the start of the meal, along with an amazing extra extra virgin olive oil, sprinkled liberally with parmesan cheese.  Sort of a do it yourself alfredo, right? ;D  Maybe not!  Delicious nonetheless!   Biaggi's has always gone out of their way to make unique, delicate, and very refined dishes.  The raviolis are a house specialty, and a guest favorite, I know that much.  My sister flies from California for the Butternut Squash!    During one dinner party, we did have a waiter who accidentally had a coffee carafe (they were talking about changing them out at the time, so they probably have by now, as the design they had on these things was a nightmare!  The servers said they burned themselves on them ALL THE TIME) explode in her hands, which led to coffee running down the back of a guest's chair, straight onto their $200 coat.  Biaggi's gave them a voucher for a free cleaning, without any guff, and then said that if the stain wouldn't come out, they'd pay for a new one!    I thought that was so upstanding, I added an extra star for it, otherwise I would have rated the restaurant (and the overall experience) a 3.    The final point worth mentioning is that Biaggi's is not cheap.  Think Olive Garden prices, but smaller (not necessarily a bad thing), more refined meals.  And if you plan to drink, it's only gonna get worse.  There are a few places where drinking out is still viable, but this restaurant is not one of them!"}
{"text":"Went there on my birthday. Upscale environment and delicious food. I love the lobster soup yet it is a little too salty. Also highly recommend their Sangria Rossi"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  The staff was friendly and did a great job as the group that I was in was very large (spread over two tables).  I had the roasted vegetable risotto and it was good.  Nice and creamy and the vegetables were cooked very well. The only negative thing about the risotto was that it was a little flat."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great. It's like a cheap wanna be version of fancy Italian. Wait staff is very nice but management came off rude. Probably because we were a big group but they should have been trying to be accommodating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite full service restaurant in C-U. Incredible waitstaff, nice decor, and a wonderful variety of food (at reasonable prices) that's a step above most chain restaurants. I've never had a negative experience after eating here dozens upon dozens of times over the years with family, friends, family friends, and even once with my entire high school class. (Small school, of course---60 kids per grade---but the restaurant nonetheless did a tremendous job accommodating all of us, and our graduation dinner was flawless from start to finish.)  Somehow I've yet to dine outdoors here, but the people who do always appear to have be having a great time."}
{"text":"I say walking in here this place is a little higher class than a Macaroni Grill or Maggiano's for those of you in the know. We called in a togo order which was taken by the bar and was told it would be ready in about 20 minutes. When we arrived 20 minutes later, the place was pretty empty and there were a ton of staff hanging around the front. I didn't get the warm fuzzies from walking in but rather blank stares which wasn't very welcoming IMO. But i continued on to the bar to pick up my food. Unfortunately the food wasn't ready so we had to wait about 10 more minutes. We weren't in a rush, but accurate timing is important so theres something to consider.   About the food--- 1. Bread is amazing. They give it to you with togo orders! Its fully, garlicy, salty, just delish. Sad news tho, it was probably the best part of the meal. It came with a side sauce that was very oily, and not really necessary but it was nice that it came with the togo order.  2. I asked for a side salad, but they charged me for a regualar. that being said, its decently sized. You can't go too wrong with a caesar salad.  3. I ordered the Chicken Piccante pizza. for the size and price. I'll give it two thumbs up. Was it amazing? Not really. For the amount of ingredients they put on it, you would think that it should all mesh together and really go great. But it was actually pretty perplexing. Not my favorite combination of foods,but separately are all wonderful. quick note: i think it tastes better the next morning.   Overall, it was just okay. It was convenient when i got it, but i wouldn't be rushing over here to get some food.   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Not a great dining experience. Adequate service, but food is just ok. Definitely didn't love it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, couple behind us got engaged right before we sat down. Started out with a couple drinks which were amazing. I got the butternut squash ravioli and I loved it, my boyfriend got the ziti al forno which he said was amazing. Little pricy but was worth it. Good date night spot"}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if I could.  The service was excellent.   The food was good.  I ordered something that I didn't like.  They offered to take it off my bill which I refused.  It was my fault, not theirs, yet they wanted to take it off anyway.  Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Biaggi's gets a million thumbs up for their GF menu and options. The bread you get is AMAZING (and IMHO, way more delicious than the usual bread), you get an actual menu of actual dishes and not just a list of salads and burgers you can order without the bun, and they have drink and dessert options outside the usual flourless chocolate cake (which, don't get me wrong, I love, but let's have options.)  The service was wonderful, the food was great and prompt."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd love a chain Italian restaurant, but Biaggis is delicious, plain and simple. My boyfriend and I go there about once every month and we usually split the wedge salad with blue cheese crumbles, and the penne porcini, which is permanently on the \"specials\" list, though when we went this last weekend (labor day weekend), it wasn't on the specials menu, but when we asked for it, they made it for us anyway. It's delicious, if you like mushrooms, get this! Remember, Penne Porcini. The bread is delicious. Service is always very good! For dessert, the Bananas Foster is pretty good, a bit on the rich side. The chocolate cake thing they have is delicious! Tiramisu is good, as is the warm apple crostada. There can be some noisy families, and sometimes an entire soccer team will roll in, but if you go in slightly off hours, it can be a really pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. My first test for any Italian place is whether or not they bring you bread and oil to start the meal, and Biaggi's passes. I've now been here 3 different times and tried 3 different entrees, each of which had been really good: the lobster alfredo, the shrimp and salmon risotto, and the battered walleye over risotto. The lobster alfredo was really creamy; they use squid ink pasta - it has a vaguely sea-like flavor - which pairs really well with the shellfish. The shrimp and salmon risotto has some kind of lemon sauce, and the risotto tastes delicate and delicious. This last time I had the walleye with risotto; again the risotto has the perfect texture. I'm not realizing I've only had seafood there; next time I go I'll have to try some meat.  The only negative I'd mention is that the some of the wait staff haven't known much about the menu. They have been good for recommending their favorites or what is popular, but not good at knowing details: one waitress told my wife the spumoni had mint I've cream in it. (We asked if it really wasn't pistachio and she immediately admitted she was probably confused.) another told me the squid ink pasta want squid ink, but she checked with the kitchen, and was helpful so it wasn't a big deal.   The desserts we've tried have all been really good. My wife loved the spumoni (one of her favorite desserts). We liked the creme brulee and the bombolini were really soft and delicious. I want to try the blood orange sorbetto some time.  Overall, we really like this place. They pair flavors really well, and the sauces are delicious. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner one weeknight, and the place was fairly empty. We got excellent service with many staff attending to our needs. I chose the swordfish special. It was cooked a little more than I'd like, so I would err on the side of rarer when ordering. It was delicious, though! My husband enjoyed his pesto chicken entree. It was a little smaller of a meal than mine, but, since it's on the lighter fare menu, it made sense.   We were interested in trying the sherry tomato soup, so the server gave us a sample. SO good and light! Yes, it's worth getting what seems like a simple soup - or at least trying a sample."}
{"text":"Hmmm where do I start.  I guess I could give them FIVE stars alone just for taking on the daunting task of feeding 35 young, LOUD track stars and their parents. You see, we were in Bloomington for the Track Tournament at Wesleyan University.  We were tired, the kids were sweaty (I'm being nice) and HUNGRY and did I mention we were loud?  Well, we were given a private room, I presume in hopes of keeping the noise level down for the other patrons. Hahahaha well, it was worth the try.  Anyway, I digress, on to the service.   We were assigned 5 waiters/waitresses.  They moved seamlessly throughout the private dining area, taking orders, filling and refilling beverage requests, bringing bread and conversing with us. HOW they managed to do all that AND get us in and out of there in under two hours is beyond me!  The FOOD. The food was DELICIOUS!  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were on day two of eating food out of a cooler, but I sincerely doubt that. My husband ordered the Chicken Pimietro (I know I spelled that wrong). It was melt in your mouth good. Yes, I stole some off his plate (don't judge me). Hmmm, I hope he never reads my yelps and discovers my dirty little secret.  I, on the other hand, opted for the Chicken Pietra (succulent chicken breast stuffed with Smoked Gouda and Ham). This was served with asparagus and I asked for Herb Roasted Potatoes instead of the garlic mashed listed on the menu. Don't worry, I didn't actually eat them, I traded my potatoes for my hubby's zucchini and squash. All I can say is.....Why isn't there one of these in MD? Oh wait, I think another yelper said it was along the lines of Maggianos, but I can't say I agree. The atmosphere was different (better), the menu was less overwhelming in regards to choices and the customer service was spectacular.   If I ever find myself back in Bloomington (read that as see you next year), I will definitely be stopping by WITHOUT the track entourage!"}
{"text":"Good enough in Champaign-Urbana. A lot of people are fans of their lobster fettucini although I generally don't trust seafood in the midwest (the only time i got this dish the lobster did not taste fresh...) but they do have other great dishes too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Tuesday after work. I had the lobster bisque and the beet salad which made for a fantastic meal. To be real, this meal was as good as the best meal I've ever had -- I was strongly tempted to return the next day and have the same dishes. The soup was incredible with a great lobster flavor and with a taste complexity. The beet salad was phenomonal -- beets, arugula, balsamic dressing, and cherries, wow; it was a dish to slowly enjoy! We had a young guy give us great service and helped me with picking a good, inexpensive Shiraz and it proved to be perfect. This restaurant is a total success! Great food presentation should also be noted. To counter my current exuberance, in the past, I has a fish dish that I had to return twice because it was undercooked."}
{"text":"Took advantage of restaurant week and had their lunch special. Had the peach and shrimp appetizer, the rock shrimp premavara, and the tiramisu. It was good not great. Same with the bread. The bread and appetizers didn't taste fresh. The sauce on the entre was very good and the tiramisu was great. Our waiter was a pro!!  He was personable, attentive and aimed to please!  He gave helpful suggestions. I give him 5 stars!!  I will be back to try their lasagna and salads."}
{"text":"Over priced and ala cart for the majority of the menu items. Was not impressed with the food either way. Our server Tex was less than enthused to help us whether it was service or just to ask what was the most popular items on the menu. Didn't even ask if we wanted a salad or appetizer .Didnt seem happy to be there and it made us feel unimportant . Side note the bread basket is to die for ,but had to practically beg for more. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant.  much better than olive garden as its main competition.  I love the pork chops as my main dinner, but their chicken parm is outstanding as well.  The bread served ahead of the meal is always a treat as well."}
{"text":"The food is good and authentic. However, the hitch is that our waitress was kind of impatient and rush"}
{"text":"The food was good. The wait staff are friendly and attentive. When we were there this time, there was a very large and loud group. They were open to us moving to a quieter corner of the large restaurant. I would come again."}
{"text":"I think their new location was forced as their old location was going to run out of overflow parking if not enough of *any* parking, how that transition went for the staff, I have no idea.  So the newer/remodeled (was an Irish style place) is now more open to view and looks bigger to the eye.  I liked Biaggi's previously with the usual Italian/American style fare, I guess, not being a foodie purist, so I expected their previous great service from staff and got it.  I think sometimes their staff is a little thin but that's Madison's tight labor market and if I may rant some, the insane treatment, mostly of women, regarding the wait staff, the draconian pay structure seemingly singled out exclusively for women, of course Hillary did not get elected so scratch any changes there, in any restaurant, not just here, end rant.  I wouldn't want to try  waiting on customers, it might get bloody?  But to the food, very nice tasting Italian food with the usual smattering of typical American dishes.  We been to this Biaggi's several times in the past year an only once noticed some slow or accidental service snafu's.  I just blame that on today's reality, not the unreality of the advertising world.  Thankfully this is another Madison/Middleton restaurant that is in the plus column that gives greater choices for hungry customers.  I mean great or not, it's a tough business to be into.  Good luck to this place and it's competition."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner and reasonably priced. I had the bread and oil to start and then the Lobster Fettuccine. It was absolutely delicious! I was suprised by the amount of lobster in the pasta dish! And don't stop there...the Tiramisu is to die for. Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Biaggi's is fantastic. They've recently remodeled and it looks great in there. I feel comfortable and relaxed. The servers are knowledgeable on the food and the vast wine selection. Be sure to ask for Kyle's section of he is there. He won't let you down in pairing the perfect wine with anything you want to eat. I make sure to try their specials every time I'm in there. The risotto is almost always on point. It can be pricey if you aren't paying attention, but the food is well worth it. With the remodel, I was hoping they'd update the bathrooms but they still seem tacky to me. But if that's my only complaint, you know I believe in this restaurant. Five stars (4.5 if I could - due to the bathrooms and the priciness, but it's way better than Olive Garden.)"}
{"text":"Solid restaurant. Not blow the socks off kinda place but kept me coming back two nights in a row.  First night had the cheese and black forest ham ravioli with parmesean and Romano cheese and tiramisu. All great.  Second night had the chicken parm with spaghetti Alfredo. Chicken was standard but pasta was great."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, awesome service, delicious bread & oil/parmesan. Very mediocre food.   However, if you like donuts... I highly recommend Bomboloni.. one of the best deserts I've EVER had. (+1 star)"}
{"text":"Went when they premiered their 'summer' cocktails, all $5.   I give credit to the bartender staff, making some for the first time, trying to be prompt and attentive. Would recommend having a menu/flier out of the featured cocktails, as many there for that event where staring at the list sent to their emails.  Free apps were bar snacks (I thought they'd be some of their menu apps)-Parmesan chips (tasty), an olive medley (good), and some really sweetened popcorn.  Was almost wet with whatever flavoring...reminded me of icing??  Either way, would not eat that again.   First time in the new location. Was nice, more open.    Props again to bar staff and management that did their best.   Lastly....Please find another way to make your key lime pie martini.  You guys shouldn't have to use a battery operated whisk to make these things. :)"}
{"text":"The servers here are top-notch. I haven't had anything I didn't like - wait - in all honestly, I was there when they were training in a new bartender and my martini was a little rough - it was like a vermouthi. But, over all, the food, service, experience is great. Lunch menu is much more reasonable than dinner menu."}
{"text":"Really fast service, no problem customizing dishes to different dietary needs or tastes.  Beet salad and lobster fettucini were favorites."}
{"text":"Celebrating my daughter's MBA graduation and it was also Mothers Day.  I am not sure what was going on with air conditioning, but our entire party of 5 were uncomfortably Hot.  Lots of people and cooking going on, but would have thought they would have planned for that!  Our food took forever to come out; even the head server made it back once to apologize for the delay.  The backroom had some hazy,smoke Thing going on and we could smell as we sat next to that room. Cough cough.  Don't know why, but I ordered the pork chip dinner.  Two very thin, nothing special meat was served in a lot of oily drippings. They tried to make it better with a dollop of flavored butter. The mashed potatoes tasted like instant with no garlic and the fresh veggies were strips of red peppers and a few green beans.  Tasted the lasagna (good) and BBQ chicken pizza(very good)."}
{"text":"This place struck me as an Olive Garden with trendier decor. Biaggi's is a chain restaurant that serves mediocre, Americanized Italian food. Our server said the special was whitefish milanese, which she pronounced \"mill-ahn-eez.\" No.  I gave Biaggi's a shot because it's close to home -- I've driven by it but never tried it. We had bread, side salads, veggie risotto and eggplant parmesan. Here were a few comments during dinner: --\"I like the little goodies [cucumber/red pepper] in the salad more than the actual salad.\" --\"I like your risotto you cooked at home more than this.\" --\"I have to cut my eggplant parmesan with a knife. I shouldn't have to do that.\" --\"I would come back here for the bread. Nothing else.\" --\"Let's not get dessert. We have some Mounds candy bars in the car from when we bought dog food at Mounds.\"  No, grazie."}
{"text":"Based on their pasta and the little pizza I've tried, this would be closer to 3 than 4 stars. It's perfectly enjoyable, but nothing special. But most of the bread is very nice, the servings were generous, the atmosphere is quite pleasant, the wine selection is good, and the service is attentive, even if our waiter was a bit distracted at times, so I feel like it deserves the extra star. The price is a bit high for the food alone, but the overall experience will probably be worth it if you give it a shot."}
{"text":"This was NOT the best meal experience of my life. My sister and I had planned on going to Eno Vino but we discovered that there was a long wait. We went to Biaggi's instead. First off, the bread was under salted and dense. Then came the butternut squash ravioli. This dish sounded great and when it came out, it looked promising. So imagine my surprise when I bit into the pasta to discover...PUMPKIN PIE! Holy nutmeg Batman! The pumpkin pie resemblance didn't stop there: it was incredibly  sweet and the ravioli pasta made me think of the underdone and soggy bottom crust of a pumpkin pie. Oh waiter, pile some whipped cream on this bad boy and move it to the dessert menu. By comparison, I think I preferred the under salted bread."}
{"text":"Plan's for pizza down the street fell through when we found out the other place only had take away service.  We found Biaggi's on the recommendation from co-workers and were excited for a good experience.  Our server was very friendly, and our meals arrived from the kitchen very quick.  Almost too quick, but we weren't going to complain.  Towards the end of our entrees is when things went south.  A uniformed policeman entered the restaurant and walked towards our table.  He calmly asked another server to talk to him in the restaurant lobby.  Suddenly, and without warning, the restaurant parking lot became a flurry of police activity.  I couldn't independently confirm it, but it appeared the server had been wanted on a warrant that was serviced in the restaurant.  The server was detained in the back of the patrol car as we exited.  Otherwise, dessert was fantastic.  Had the bread pudding--amazing."}
{"text":"I was in town from the West Coast visiting family and friends and delighted to see a menu where the food wasn't fried and the food portions weren't the size of a platter.  The menu was varied and I loved the food and was pleased to be able to have a half order of any pasta of my choosing.  We went with a large group and were seated in the back dining room.  It was rather loud, because they put all the big groups together and we were sandwiched between a wedding party and a group of students celebrating their return to campus.  Still, I have to say that I really liked the food at Biaggi's on this Saturday evening.  The wine list for Pinot Noir was great and my wine selection was very nice.  I had a wonderful half order of butternut squash ravioli and their amazing beet, goat cheese and arugula salad, which comes on a long platter.  However, this is the kind of food I can enjoy in large quantities and I did manage to share it at the table, although some didn't quite seem to know what to do with the arugula.  That was fine, as there were a few of us who were happy to finish it.  Wish I could have some of that salad right now.  I would definitely eat at Biaggi's again and perhaps ask for the first dining room as it may be a bit less noisy, although I can't say this for sure since I didn't eat in main dining room.  The wait staff was very helpful, friendly and managed our large group exceptionally well."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a restaurant that isn't insanely expensive but still a step above your traditional chain. As a table of two, we got in right away at 7pm on a Saturday.  My partner has a shellfish allergy and they were very accomdating. The wedge salad was enough for two and had a light flavored bleu cheese dressing; well porportioned and not too over done. I had a nicely cooked filet mignon. We shared a tiramisu which was perfect! We will be definitely revisiting in the future."}
{"text":"I was here about a month ago and it was certainly alright. I went with family for a grad night dinner. I had a pretty good eggplant parm while my grandmother had the butter-squash ravioli I believe. My grandmother remarked it was a bit sweet for her and upon trying it, I thought it was tasty but on the sweet side to be sure. But speaking of which, the cheesecake was the dessert I ended up ordering. Interestingly it came in a jar which I accepted as a neat, novel little thing. However the berries were more present than any other flavor in the dessert. I ended up getting lots of tart not so much rich creaminess you might expect from a cheesecake. Service was good but I still wish the berries didn't end up taking over what was my final impression of the meal."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant. Never have had any issues with service. Wait isn't usually long. Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is always decent but my last trip there was horrible due to service. Our server hardly said a word, not even asking what we want just stood and looked at us with his pennready to write it down. Did not check once for refills or asked how the meal was. Didn't even get a thanks for coming in or have a good night after he brought the final bill."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night because Eno Vino was pretty busy. The bread they give for you to start is AWESOME! However, I got butternut squash ravioli. The sauce it came with was bland and the entire entrée was cold. The bits of cut up squash that came in the dish were not even cooked and we're hard like cold carrots. Very disappointing considering the price I had to pay. Service was also S L O W and I think dude was new because he was super awkward. First time visit and don't plan on going back. I will just stick to Eno Vino.."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch and dinner at Biaggi's several times.  No matter if you're eating lunch or dinner you get the great bread to dip in the olive oil and cheese mix.  The place is always clean and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  For lunch I especially like their Half and Half menu which gives you a number of options to satisfy whatever you have a taste for.  I'm a fan of the Turkey and Avocado sandwich  with either a Caesar of Wedge salad.  Most recently my wife and I stopped there for dinner and both had the Fettuccini with Lobster.  The portion size was perfect; I had more than enough to eat and my wife took home leftovers.  I thought the spice level was somewhat mild but my wife felt it was just a little spicy.  We did both agree that there was a generous amount of lobster and mushrooms in the dish. My wife and I absolutely love the Lobster Corn Chowder.  Because Biaggi's has a convenient location on the West side right off the Beltline with ample parking I typically go there versus some of the other Italian restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"We were in Champaign on business (Thursday 3/12) and decided we deserved a really nice dinner. We chose Biaggi's based on Yelp reviews. We had an excellent server and our food was very good. We both had salads to start. My husband had the small house salad and he said it was one of the best salads he has ever had. I had a small Caesar salad that was not the best I've ever had, but it was good. For entrees, my husband had spaghetti and meat balls and I had Farfalle Alfredo. They were served promptly. Mine could have been a little hotter, but it was OK and very tasty. The foccacia in their bread basket is DELISH! We did not have dessert, but they sounded very inviting. The atmosphere was very cozy. The only complaint was the large family sitting at the table beside us who allowed on of their children to cry instead of taking him out. This is a very nice restaurant and, if your child is not happy, please don't spoil others' evenings."}
{"text":"Caveat emptor.  My meal:  Roasted Beet & Arugula \"Starter\" Salad - Good concept, decent flavor profile, but over dressed and simply too large and too heavy to start a meal. One third the size would have been ample and half the price would have been worth it (and still profitable I suppose).  Capellini di Mer - Very generic which could have been OK if not for technical flaws and so-so ingredients. Much of the pasta was stuck together in 1/4 to 1/2 inch clumps and under cooked in the center of the clump. I couldn't even properly twirl it on to my fork. (I wonder if the chef ever heard of a technique called stirring?). And the perviously frozen, grocery store quality seafood and out of the jar quality sauce reminded me of what I throw together when I clean out my freezer and pull something off the pantry shelf for a quick weekday supper at home.   BTW -- pretty pricey for the so-so quality, no doubt \"paying\" for quantity (which was excessive in my opinion).  But it's a chain - so. . ."}
{"text":"Update. I went back and everything was on par again.  They are redeemed!  I'd like to update the number of stars, but evidently it can't be done."}
{"text":"Not my favorite restaurant in the town, but I do need to give them some credit because they have a whole gluten free menu and are very concious about Celiac disease and gluten intolerance. In fact, on of the waiters there has Celiac. The GF pizzas are very good, as is the GF bread. The fish dishes are also good. I'd like to have the GF pasta but unfortunately it's a mixture of rice and spinach, and I'm allergic to spinach (not related to my Celiac). I wish they just had 100% rice pasta. But they are very accommodating, although some of the waiters there are so perky that they can drive you nuts a bit..."}
{"text":"Not authentic not a decent Italian experience. The breads are good. The sauces terrific. Just ok value.  The staff is generally well trained, the service flows fairly quickly. I love the new look."}
{"text":"The one in Bloomington normal is superior in every way.   First, it took nearly 40 minutes for the food to come out for a party of 6, on a regular lunch hour. If you are in a hurry I would suggest maybe skipping this place and hitting up the fazzolis.   Our waiter was a friendly guy but it didn't make up for the fact that the Alfredo sauce on my pasta was absolute crap. As a proud Italian American I'm pretty sure the sauce they put on my pasta was either out of a can or made in such a bulk that they need copious amounts of water. Either way the sauce was absolutely disappointing and not worth the price.  My Caesar salad was also a major let down. With zero to little dressing on it and for some reason over seasoned pepper on it. If you like pepper this is your salad, if your like me and expect you c. Salad to be creamy and delicious you should just avoid it.  The bread was fantastic so I guess they have that going for them.. I won't be returning to this location which is a bummer because I've always enjoyed the Bloomington normal location"}
{"text":"I wasn't aware this was a chain until I saw Ramya K's review.  Biaggi's quality and look is a step above Olive Garden.  Ambience is similar to Macaroni Grill (open space, higher ceilings).  Nice warm bread served right away, to be dipped in olive oil.  My fellow diners loaded up their olive oil with grated parm, also on the table, before dipping.  I went with the Lobster Corn Chowder to start - large bowl of sweet, creamy soup with chunks of lobster and vegetables.  My main was the Roasted Beet and Arugula Salad.  Beautiful presentation and a decent size for an entree if you aren't starving (or you've already eaten a big bowl of soup and two pieces of bread).  In addition to the beets and arugula, this salad also had avocado chunks and dried cherries plus three rounds of Montchevre goat cheese coated with spicy ground walnuts.  I went with our waitress's recommendation and subbed the Honey Balsamic dressing that was supposed to accompany my salad with a creamy Italian-type.  Very nice all around.  My fellow diners chose the Chicken Piemontese (her favorite - chicken breast stuffed with ham and cheese in a lemon butter sauce, with potatoes and veg), the Filet Mignon (which was a decent 8oz size and looked well prepared, served with potatoes and veg), and the Rigatoni alla Toscana (pasta in red sauce with sausage, onions and peppers).    I wish I could have tempted them to try an appetizer or two because this part of the menu looked very nice.  I may have to go back alone and try one - Bacon Wrapped Dates or Tomato Mozzarella Caprese - with a glass of wine, at the bar."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I visited Biaggis last Friday, we were thrilled to be seated in the Wine Room. This is a beautiful room and we had some privacy which really helped everyone unwind after a very busy week. We ordered Crab cakes first and they were flavorful. I ordered the Shrimp Salad for the entree and my friend ordered the Salmon salad, both salads were delicious. A couple of friends ordered the vegetarian pizza which looked great. The waitstaff was very polite and attentive. We will continue to visit whenever we can."}
{"text":"We just had the worst pizza - ever!   Mushy crust.  Way too salty.  It was pretty much a pan of melted cheese.  Yuck!  Had we not been with friends who had received their dinners at the same time, we'd have sent it back for sure.  Typically this Biaggi's does a fine job.  Not tonite.  We decided to share a Margarita pizza.  Wrong choice.  If you want pizza, then go to a pizza shop.  Not here.  At least, not tonite.  The server was below average as well.  He acted as if he really didn't care to be there.  Certainly not engaged with our foursome.  When he topped off my club soda with water from a pitcher it was obvious he wasn't in to being a server this evening.  The crime brulee was decent, but certainly not excellent.  This visit to Biaggi's was not a good one.  Too bad because it's usually good."}
{"text":"They have great desserts and drink options, but as they've eliminated really great entree options and replaced them with a pasta noodle and 1 lb. of bread crumbs, things have gone downhill.  I prefer to only come here if it's a family event of some sort, otherwise count me out.  This place just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Madison I have to go to Biaggi's. It's a favorite of my girlfriend's family, which is fortunate for me. I wouldn't expect an Italian place in Wisconsin to be able to get such good seafood, but I'm always pleasantly surprised. It's not necessarily the most authentic Italian food you'll ever eat, but that doesn't mean it tastes bad."}
{"text":"We have been Biaggi fans since it first opened on Junction Road.  I do think the old restaurant with the dark wood was cozier, but the new location in Middleton, which is more modern looking is nice too.  The food is stellar, always perfect, with large portions (we always go home with a doggy bag).   I would have one request of the management, and that would be to put blinds on the windows.  We were there recently for dinner, and the sun was blinding one side of our table.  There were no blinds on the window, so there was nothing they would have been able to do to fix the problem.  I know they must be going for \"a look\", but the blinds would only have to be used for a short time in the evening."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service ok. However, experience was a total disappointment. Came for my real birthday with grandchildren. Expectation to have candles and cake as part of the celebration dashed.  When I shared it was my birthday was told I could only have a free dessert if I was a club member. Kinda a big requirement for someone who rarely if ever comes to the restaurant as I do not live near Biaggios. Company policy is to not give away food, direct quote from manager on duty. Perhaps a now popular policy but somehow what used to be a great place to visit is not as welcoming. Manager said he could buy me a birthday treat but it was phrased in a less than appealing way. Opted to have a better experience elsewhere. Just posting to share their policy."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place when I was staying in Middleton.. The service was great and that free bread they gave was GREAAAAAAAAAAAAT .. i think it had crack in it, it was addicting ... I ordered a pizza, and it was delicious and perfect. I asked for it well done, it wasnt too cheesy which I love... I had a nice glass of white wine ( I can't remember the name of it) YUMM"}
{"text":"This restaurant is OK, not great.  Pretty much what you'd expect of an Italian restaurant chain.  The menu had the normal selection of pastas, chicken, and antipasti.  They also had a few off the menu specials.  I wasn't too blown away by anything.  I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was a good size (too big really) that came with two chicken breasts and a side of pasta.  I can't really speak too much of the interior because for some reason we got seated in a semi-private room away from the main dining room.  There was one other large party in our room and they were quite noisy so I sort of felt like we were crashing in on their private area.  It was weird and I'm not sure why we were seated in there.  Our waiter was very friendly and the prices were moderate - around $15 for a pasta entree."}
{"text":"We were looking for a fancy restaurant to eat lunch, and stumbled upon Biaggi's. I loved the atmosphere, and our server was extremely nice!  We ordered Bruschetta Classico for appetizers, and it was OK. Nothing special. For my main course I got the Capellini Di Mare, and the noodles were swollen and the pasta was cold. I thought it was only my pasta, but my friend's pasta was also cold. It tasted like they made it yesterday, put it in the fridge, and microwaved it. The food looked pretty and arranged well, but that's about it.  Overall experience was OK. I would not go out of my way to come back. Food: 2 stars Service & ambience: 4 stars"}
{"text":"We ordered a olive and mushroom pizza over the phone. Twice in a row they got everything right except that they loaded up with extra sausage on everything. We didn't want sausage and we are vegetarian. I think it is a bit strange that all of them were what we wanted except for the extra sausage.   PS they don't have Hawaiian pizzas"}
{"text":"Came here for my graduation lunch and I gotta say more restaurants need to be modeled after this establishment. The food and service were impeccable. I made reservations and arrived early and they were able to accommodate us. After warmly greeting us, we made our way to the table. Throughout our meal, the staff were very attentive and checked in on us very often for refills and making sure we were enjoying the food.   Here's what we had: -warm baguette and focaccia rolls: freeeeee!   -calamari  -toasted ravioli  -shrimp and salmon milanese served with risotto (fish was cooked very well and shrimp was succulent)  -sea bass with cauliflower purée   -cheese and prosciutto stuffed pork chop with asparagus  -lobster pizza (my fav - crust was buttery and lobster was so tender)  Overall, I had an amazing experience! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you exactly what I liked or didn't like about Biaggi's.  It had a sort of swanky feel inside that the quality of the food didn't match.  I had lunch here last week, and had some sort of pasta with meat sauce with a touch of cream.  i don't remember what it was called.  The penne were sort of chewy, and the meat sauce tasted kind of like prego.  I think prego tastes okay, but my \"fancy\" restaurant meal shouldn't taste like it.  I wished I had ordered the squash ravioli.    My boyfriend had some sort of pasta with an chicken alfredo sauce and bread crumbs on the top. I had a bite, and i didn't think it tasted like anything.  He thought it wasn't any different than some garbage from the Olive Garden, but I disagree.  The Olive Garden is awful.  This wasn't terrible, it was just bland.  The bread basket was good, and the waiter was super attentive.  I guess overall, it all sort of struck me as \"generic\"."}
{"text":"Great food with reasonable prices for the quality. Very friendly and accommodating waitstaff! No less than three people thanked us as we left."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Crowded, popular place....which is a good sign, but the parking lot is waaaay too small for the number of restaurants in this little mall.  The service was great and the food was very nice.  Had a half & half with chopped chicken salad and lobster chowder.  The salad was good; the soup was great!    The bread was very good, but my table mates were all gluten free types so I felt I should limit myself to one piece....probably good cuz I could have eaten it all!"}
{"text":"I wok close to this restaurant.  I often order the take out lunch special.  I am in love with the Wedge salad, which has crumbles of blue chees as well as red onion and tomatoes. With the lunch special you also get a chose of soup, sandwich, pasta.  Only around 10.00.  They also give you bread to go! I use it as two meal! Will defiantly go back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today and food was excellent, bread was a hit but highlight was rage service, our waiter was amazing. Even told the manager how impressive Kvame was, definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A little pricey but delicious. Had shrimp and crab cannelloni which was wonderful. Service is attentive and quick. Lunch was perfect!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came very highly recommended by everyone that I encountered, and I can understand why. The food is lovely the staff is charming, knowledgeable and kind. The food is good, fresh and flavorful. The menu was a bit cumbersome and had too many options and pages, the lunch menu was even too much for a dinner menu, though I appreciate variety it's a bit overwhelming if you're doing a working lunch. Would say that it's definitely better than average, but not necessarily the best I've had 3.5ish but pretty amazing for Central Wisconsin.   The patio, though I didn't sit out on it was super cute and had a nice shady yet sun streaked feel to it, and could be nice for a small low maintenance event if they rent it out. Kudos to the chef and proprietors of the operation for food and management."}
{"text":"Aaammmazinggggg! We got there late night on a Saturday and they were very very kind and packed our food up for us, which was delicious! The baked ziti is to die for as is their special pasta. We also had the calamari. Our waiter was a very helping hand and they gave us a lot of delicious bread to take home. Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"I ate a dinner at this restaurant with several business associates. The restaurant was slightly upscale. They have appetizers such as crab cakes, calamari, soups, and salads. They have main courses such as pizza, stromboli, pasta, fish, scallops, steaks, lamb and pork chops, and chicken parmesan. Everyone at my table said that they greatly enjoyed the food and service. Price was moderate."}
{"text":"If you want Italian food that is a step above Olive Garden then Biaggi's is your place! Decent selection of typical Italian offerings that will satisfy and you don't have to spend $150 for a night out for two with wine like you would if you went to one of the premium Italian places. So yeah. Mid grade."}
{"text":"The grilled veggie risotto & penne sardi are fantastic. Or meal came with a selection of focaccia, baguette, olive oil & parmesan for dipping. Yum! The staff was attentive & got our order exactly right. I'll have to come back & try other menu selections.  The restaurant interior is paneled in dark wood & earthy colours; a little upscale for a fancy dinner if you want it to be. Even so, I wasn't snubbed for walking in in shorts. Instead, a friendly host greeted us as we walked in. Grab a drink at the extensive bar if there's a wait for a table. (We didn't have to wait.)   There's plenty of parking & bike parking nearby. Special, convenient parking available if you are picking up an order."}
{"text":"I'd give them a zero if I could.  Is the food good?  Yes.    So why the low rating?  Dishonesty and abysmal customer service.  My wife and I hosted a party for 40 of our closest friends and family.  We pre-arranged for each guest to be able to order whatever they wanted off the menu.  This included appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Dinner went off well up until the dessert part.  The guests were all given dessert menus and as they began to order desserts, I was pulled aside and told that they ran out of most of the desserts.  Strange, I thought.  How they heck do you run out of creme brulee?! The manager explained that they had been very busy the night before and simply ran out of most everything.  However, they still had cheesecake, chocolate cake, and lemon tower cake.  Again, strange.  So they ran out of everything OTHER than the stuff that could be easily sliced and flopped on a plate for the least amount of effort.  Bullshit.  Indeed, we were informed by one of the kinder and more empathetic waitresses that this was a complete and utter lie.  Not only did they not run out of desserts, but they were serving them to other patrons at the restaurant.  Heck, one of our guests was even able to score the bread pudding before we were unceremoniously cut off like a drunk at closing time.  I would love for somebody to explain to me why the $1,200 I spent was not good enough to: A) get what I specifically arranged for IN ADVANCE; and B) at least get the common courtesy of an honest explanation.  Would I have been upset if they had told me they simply could not do the volume of desserts we were asking for?  Of course, but I would have understood, and they would not have lost me as a customer.  The real problem is that this could have been dealt with when we arranged the party.  We were promised one thing, and they refused to deliver on that promise.  As it stood, we told our guests to make sure they saved room SPECIFICALLY FOR the wonderful array of desserts that would be available.  I cannot explain the disappointment on the guests faces who were given dessert menus and had wanted to order tiramisu or bread pudding, but were then told that they could not have it.  Of course, we look like the cheapskates who wouldn't spring for the good stuff.  It wrecked what should have been a special occasion.  My wife and I spent more time farting around with the dishonest manager and chef than we did with our guests.  Pathetic.  I have had two parties there and countless dinners and lunches.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding like a snob, I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants (especially expensive ones).  The reason I went to Biaggi's was because I got a $50 gift certificate from work.  Yay for cheap eating!  My boyfriend and I went around 6pm on a Saturday.  Thank goodness that place is huge, because there were tons of people there.  You'd think it was the only place to eat in Madison and the surrounding area.  But I guess that usually speaks for the restaurant, though.  The service was friendly, but the waiter (and hostess) checked on us too frequently.  The kind of frequency that gets irritating, because it's very apparent that they want you to GET OUT NOW NOW NOW.  We got a really fruity and wonderful bottle of red wine (I forget what kind, ah well).  I had a dish that had been recommended to me by two different people--Lobster Fettuccine.  It was, in fact, phenomenal.  The sauce was just to die for.  The lobster tasted buttery and fresh.  Plus, it looked dramatic, as the pink sauce was served over black fettuccine.  It appealed to all sorts of food snob in me!  My boyfriend's Shrimp Oreganata was not bad, just unremarkable.  The first shrimp he had tasted bad and fishy, but fortunately, the rest were fine.  The sauce was plain, kind of like a thin marinara.    We shared Tiramisu for dinner, which was great!  It was positively drowned in a coffee-brandy mixture.  Mmmm...  We walked out for under $30 including the tip, thanks to the gift card."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from downtown Madison to grab a bite only to find the restaurant staff closing up at 9PM. The hours listed on google + yelp have the closing time at 10PM. Disappointment.!"}
{"text":"I went here at 8pm on a Monday night and the place was dead but I can't understand why.  The service was great.  Bread was brought right away and it was very good.  The chicken parmesan wasn't amazing, but it was pretty good.  Dessert was divine -- I had the white chocolate bread pudding and fell in love.  They also had a nutella skillet cookie that was calling my name but I could only pick one.  I'll definitely be trying this place again."}
{"text":"The food here is adequate, but nothing inventive or unique on the whole menu.  Really, it's just a caricature of an Italian restaurant; the whole thing kind of strikes me as being one of those big chain restaurants even though I don't know if I've ever seen another one. That is, the atmosphere is painted on the walls and everything is just a little too Schaumburg mall parking lot-esq.  the wait staff was friendly, but the server we had was either new to the restaurant or just poorly trained.  The wine list is rather thin with a lot of cheep bottles marked up and nothing terribly adventurous or exciting...like I said, Schaumburg mall parking lot."}
{"text":"On a Monday night the service and atmosphere was excellent.  We were promptly seated and had drinks in no time.  Our appetizer was brought out without anything sacrificed for speed and our food shortly there after.  Although we were visibly full, we were offered a dessert menu and then our check as we declined.  From start to finish, we never felt rushed or ignored.  Definitely a great place for a date or a party."}
{"text":"It was refreshing to find more restaurants near our hotel.  A co worker and I decided to try it out.  The service was good.  Our server was very informative.  He was very familiar with the menu and that is always a plus.  I ordered the grilled salmon and it came with roasted red potatoes.  YUMMY.   The place was not like any other place that I have seen but I enjoy any place that provides good service and good food.   This place gets a happy face :-)"}
{"text":"I don't care that this place is a \"chain\".  This is the second location in Biaggi's success story and there is a reason for the success. This place exceeds most downstate restaurants in having well-trained and ample waitstaff. The decor is warm, the food is good, the acoustics are quiet and pleasant and the prices are right."}
{"text":"Not bad! It's actually relatively cheap for the size of the portions, compared to other Italian places in San Francisco and New York, and the entrees can be easily split.  During lunch, they have this option where you can select two items and have unlimited refills of soup or salad with a sandwich. For just $8.00, it's a good idea and delicious! I tried their chicken marsala for dinner and found the chicken kind of dry.  We went in for dinner and lunch the next day - the waiters remembered us, probably because we were the only asians there the previous evening. It's not too far from UIUC campus!"}
{"text":"Always a good time here. The food is great, the wait staff is pleasant and talkative and it is a great place for date night. The bread alone is enough to get me craving this place any day!"}
{"text":"I've been to Biaggi's many times and have been very back and forth about how many stars to give them. But every time I've been here, something has been a little... Off...   -My party has ordered wine here many times that has been either out of stock or is served and is no longer good -My last waiter spilled about a teaspoon of red wine every time he poured a glass (note* it was the most expensive wine on the reserved menu... Smh) -My barrata appetizer was very dry -On another occasion, I was served undercooked asparagus and overcooked salmon   The service is friendly, but often amateur. Just like the food, it's a hit or miss sometimes. Despite the noise, which can make it pretty hard to hear anyone at your table, the atmosphere is pleasant.   While I have a lot of complaints, the complementary bread is excellent and the desserts don't disappoint. Try not to get too attached to a specific dessert though, because they change up the menu on occasion. Also, I like how they display the calories to each dish on the menu and offer a lighter section for those of us who don't feel like breaking the calorie bank before dessert. ;)  I think Biaggi's has a lot of potential, but just needs to work out some of their kinks."}
{"text":"While the food is good, and we used to love it for date night, I will never return after being our last experience. We made a reservation. That night, we got there, and there was no reservation under our name. We were then told there was an hour long wait. There was NO apology, no attempt to do anything. We left angrily. Then we immediately called to tell the manager how the hostess has treated us. The manager told us he did not know why we were told there was an hour wait, as the wait was only a few minutes.   I understand mistakes get made. As long as people make some attempt to show me I'm a valued customer, I'm pretty forgiving of mistakes. I've worked in the restaurant industry. I know you NEVER let a customer walk out angrily because you didn't even make an attempt to correct a problem.   When I contacted corporate, I got no response back, either. Clearly Biaggi's does not want my business, so I shall never give it to them again."}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night with Jeff Goldblum and his family of flies.  We sat outside and were constantly annoyed by Jeff and his family.  The indoor portion of the restaurant is small, and on that night, jam packed.  We were told the wait to be seated was over an hour, so we made the mistake of agreeing to eat outside.    The food was alright, but if heavy creams and oils aren't your thing I would avoid eating here.    The waitstaff appeared to barely be capable of handling the crush of people, and we had several different people waiting on our table at various times, which made for screw ups ranging from never seeing a refill, to bringing duplicates of other items.  It seemed as if they were doubly unprepared for serving people outside as well.    The first time we ever ate a biaggi's was in Salt Lake City.  That location is boss.  We left Jeff & Co. outside while we dined indoors there, and everything was absolutely top notch.  SLC Biaggi's makes this one look like a joke."}
{"text":"We went here for a lunch while on break from work.   Was recommended by a colleague.   Waiter was great, food was very good, but on this particular day the service time was extremely slow.  I understand this was because of this week being \"Restaurant Week,\" but the management should have know to appropriately staff for this busier than normal week."}
{"text":"Not my first Biaggi's experience, but this was my first visit to this location.  Five of us dined here at 1:30pm on Sunday. We made reservations ahead of time because we weren't sure how busy the place would be. We arrived and plenty of seats were available. Bar area was completely empty and the dining room was maybe 40% full. Guests were also dining on the patio.  For chain Italian food I enjoy this restaurant. I compare Biaggi's to Maggiano's in the Chicagoland area. Surprisingly, Biaggi's entrees seem to be a little more unique and they appear offer more seafood options. They're mostly specials are unique as well.   As a group we enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms. Not out of the ballpark good, but tasty. For my entree I ordered the dijon salmon, my hubs enjoyed the seafood cannelloni, my BIL had the farfalle pasta, MIL enjoyed the lasagna and my FIL had a lasagna combo.   We were very happy with the food and service. Our waitress was definitely experienced. Moderately priced. A great spot for larger groups, families, dates and more.   Very clean dining rooms.   The complimentary focaccia bread is crazy delicious.   If you're looking for a nice upgrade to Olive Garden, try Biaggi's."}
{"text":"So I went back for lunch yesterday.  Again, I was not impressed.  The food was ok.  I can't point out anything that was wrong with it.  The olive oil they use for bread dipping has changed.  It has an orange tinge to it and a little spice (but I liked it).  I got half a sandwich and soup.  I could probably find the same deal elswhere for cheaper.  My husband and I got there well after the lunch crowd, but the service was a little lacking.  We sat in front of our empty plates for about five minutes before our server removed them.  There were other employees that were sweeping or cleaning near our table, and none of them offered to remove our plates.  The employees were all friendly, and the restaurant was clean.  If their goal is mediocrity, then they are well on their way."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Biaggi's. Their pasta is incredible, I almost always order 2 half dishes (they give you more than half) because I can never choose one. Their wild boar ragu, capellini di mare, and ziti are probably my favorites, although I have not had a pasta dish I have not liked here (and I've tried pretty much all of them). Unfortunately they no longer serve the penne sardi, which was a masterpiece. Service is always spot on too. Awesome date spot for anyone who likes pasta."}
{"text":"Biaggi's is alright. Foods decent, service is good but everything seems overpriced. The best way I can explain this place is that it's like a upscale and expensive Olive Garden without the unlimited soup and salad. Ordered the Ziti and it was decent at best. Sad to say, I would rather have the Baked Ziti from Olive Garden over this place. On the bright side my sister ordered the Capellini and she was very happy with her dish aside from the fact that they leave the tails on the shrimp."}
{"text":"Food and service were FANTASTIC! Love the new location!!  We will be coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I'd like to label this place just a slightly better version of Olive Garden. A bit disappointed at what this place has become. The food was much better at their previous location on junction road.  The reason? I came with 3 others and we all tried each others' dishes. What I noticed was that the base taste was the same for all of us, meaning they basically use the same seasoning on all the dishes. We all ordered very different dishes, so it wasn't as using the same base wasn't unusual. Plus the taste was high in sodium, not flavor.  The service is great, though! The people were very helpful and super friendly, so if you want to come to get treated well, it's not a bad place to get that."}
{"text":"Traveling through Champaign-Urbana and decided to have dinner at Biaggi's as we were familiar with the menu.  We had been to Biaggi's  in other cities and had always had pleasant experiences...until this one.  We had a 7:45 reservation and got there a bit before that.  We were seated within a few minutes.  We sat at our table for over 10 minutes and no service. Not even an acknowledgment. Finally flagged someone down and they said our server would be with us shortly.  FINALLY, our server came by.  We ordered our drinks...nothing fancy just 1 beer, a soda' and an Arnold Palmer.  We also placed our order.  2 salads and a soup then our entrees. Drinks came and we drank them and we waited...waitress nowhere in site. Not sure how long it took her to come back, but it was long enough that we were all irritated.  We asked about our salads, and soup.  She said it would be out shortly.  It wasn't!  By now it's like 9:15.  We were not happy.  Finally about 10 min later our salads, etc came out.  Still no entrees.  We asked to speak with a manager.  He came by, we explained the situation.  Thank god, my husband did the talking cuz he's much more dignified than I am. LOL Manager apologized and said he had a BRAND new kitchen staff and they were still adapting, etc.  WTF...really dude!!!  Oh by the way, did I mention this was a Friday night!  The manager also said he felt really bad and dinner was on him.  Very nice gesture, but that didn't make up for the fact that we spent our entire evening sitting at Biaggi's.  Our dinner finally came out at 9:45.  By the time we left it was 10:15.  The whole evening was a disaster.  Bottom line...horrible experience and we will probably not go to Biaggi's again."}
{"text":"Definitely a chain Italian place.  I've asked people who have tried Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill and Carraba's and they put Biaggi's up there near the top.  My party of 9 dined there on a Saturday afternoon and due to the large size of our party we had to dine fairly early.  We were seated in a large private room where more of the bigger parties were situated.  Service was fast and accurate.  I ordered the Messina salad which was basically a \"Greek\" with olives, feta, onion and olive oil.  Very nice and very ample.  My entree was a stromboli which was just okay.    Everyone else had a pasta dish and everybody was very pleased.  Most had \"half-orders\" which I definitely recommend for females but if you're a man with an appetite you can definitely handle the \"whole.\"  My only real complaint is that the temperature in our area was set to \"freeze\" which was fine during the salad phase but the entrees didn't stay warm for long once they arrived.  At some point in the meal one of the other tables must have commented because the A/C went idle for a few minutes and it made an immediate difference.  Prices were very fair and they gladly packaged leftovers.  We dined at 4 p.m. and there was staff galore to handle about 50% capacity.  I would expect they could easily handle an evening setting."}
{"text":"Once again the Bucky Book dictated our dinner choice and tonight it was Biaggi's.   The coupon was a buy one entree & beverage and get the same up to a $14 value. We dislike these coupons that require a beverage purchase because we're both water people. Although we don't drink alcohol we noted the coupon couldn't be used on alcohol which we thought was odd since most entrees are $14 or more on their own & they could make more money.   Our experience was pretty good. Loved the basket of bread served with oil & Parmesan cheese. For dinner we both ordered off the light menu. Hubby got the 5 oz filet with veggies. He didn't care for the selection of mixed veggies and our waiter was able to offer other options. He went with the broccoli. I got the salmon and added the lobster clam chowder for an additional $6.   Soup was good but not great. Hubby dislikes seafood and I said to him I want this to be so good that he will want to leave me. Well he's still here so take away what you like from that.   Hubby's steak, though good, lacked presentation. The plate, including the steak, was wet from the broccoli. My dish was tasty and appealing to look at. Both were ultimately good low cal options.   A bit pricey overall so it's a good thing the soup didn't rock my world so I won't be tempted to order that again since the coupon is now history.   Finally our waiter was great and service was efficient. Based just on that we'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I actually went to Benvenudo's on a Saturday night and were told it was a half an hour wait.  After 15 minutes of screaming children in a packed waiting area with no one ahead of being seated, I called Biaggi's and asked how long their wait was.  After being told 20 minutes, I put my name on the list and we headed over.  We were greeted immediately, checked in, and given a buzzer.  The new restaurant location is beautiful and the ambiance was relaxing without the howls of tiny humans.  Before we could even take a seat a staff member was there with a smile to take us to our table.  Blake was our waiter for the evening and was incredible.  With a vast knowledge of the menu and specials he made recommendations that both my husband and I enjoyed and was just a delight to have as our server.  Our drinks and food were delivered quickly and everything was delicious.  It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend.  They saved our date night and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a local, so when I came into town for business and had to find a place to eat, I trended toward the higher end places that I knew wouldn't screw up a meal. They did well to live up to my expectations. I ordered the beet salad and a risotto because I was on a vegetarian binge. The rice in the risotto could've been cooked a little longer, but the beet salad was fantastic. Service was mostly pretty good too. I'll be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Great service and great food for a first time customer. Would definitely recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"I feel like some of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head--the atmosphere of this restaurant is swankier than the actual food.  The parking lot is small--they actually offer free valet service at certain times, which I find rather amusing, but it we found a spot in the lot and parked ourselves.  Service is attentive--if there is a wait, you get a pager. You get a bread basket with a bread that's slightly sweet--not quite like the bread offered at most Italian restaurants, and the server makes \"Biaggi butter\" for you with olive oil and parmesan (LOL).  I had a special with mushrooms and pesto, SO had a ravioli with four types of cheese.  My special was good--I wish it was lighter so more of the flavors would come through more--and his was very cheesy, good if that's what you're in the mood for.  I've also had the basalmic chicken here, which had a surprising amount of kick.  I feel like most of the dishes here have too much oils in them, making them more bland.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here although it was good. Considering the higher prices, I'd be tempted to go to Olive Garden instead. Olive garden isn't great, but the nice atmosphere and price  of Biaggi's does not live up to expectation."}
{"text":"I genuinely like Biaggi's.  It is, by far, one of the better restaurants in the Champaign/Urbana area.   It has a dark and romantic atmosphere that is nice for date night, but casual enough to bring your family after that U of I special occasion.    The food and prices are where it loses some stars for me.  The entrees are a little pricey and on top of that, all the sides are a la carte. Even though the food is good, I do not think it is good enough to justify the prices.  I think this restaurant gets away with charging so much because it is located in a college town that does not have many high quality restaurants.    The entrees I would recommend and that are worth the money are: the ravioli quattro formaggi, the lamb chops, and (I believe this is only on special) the quarter duck."}
{"text":"Went here for my brother's graduation dinner after he walked across the stage. The staff were young and fun to talk to and get to know as we were waiting for the rest of our party. The food was outstanding and the portions were not horribly huge (which Italian places are notorious for). If I am ever back in the area, I will definitely make a case to try it again! I recommend it"}
{"text":"I went there about a week ago. I had the wedge salad and the soup of tomato and bread. The wedge salad was good but the soup was oily and flavorless. The bread they serve with the olive oil was crusty and a little stale. I found our sever to be a inattentive. Maybe they just don't do lunch well."}
{"text":"Biaggi's was already good before moving out of Junction Rd. towards Greenway Station.  After the move it really only changed the one limitation of the Portofino Place building, and that was better ambiance with more seating.  Something that Biaggi's always tends to get right is how they cook shrimp and shellfish in general. Their lobster bake and shrimp dishes have always been cooked to perfection and load up on the bread while you're there... it's just as good."}
{"text":"Came again and service was fine (same waiter actually), but my food was once again not that great. I'm sure they have something good on the menu, but I have not found it and don't care to try again. Good sangria, if a bit overpriced. Would much, MUCH rather have the Irish pub back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch worth co-workers.  The service was friendly,  but slow.  We were late getting back to work.   It's a place you need more than an hour for."}
{"text":"Well, to set the stage, only two of their pasta dishes don't have cheese  A step up from Benvenuto's but you can get better Italian elsewhere"}
{"text":"The food is very good. The salmon is my prefered. The service is good too. Have area for small celebrations. Cold. The last waitress had a nice voice. The desert with crepes is good. I recomment for couples too."}
{"text":"We dropped off our son at Univ of Ill and had our last full family all together meal here.  We come from the East Coast, so I can say this meal for 5 adults and one child including wine and dessert was very reasonable and good.  The dessert \"doughnuts\" were the best of the ending - lots of little bites for sharing.  The service (on a Wed) was very good too.  Most of us stuck to pasta dishes and the sauces were flavorful; we're picky about having a good spice level (not bland).  We definitely will return here if we are visiting the university!"}
{"text":"The wait staff were curteous and attentive. I guess I had high hopes coming in, given that my newly graduated grad had made a reseration 3 months earlier. The food was mostly underwhelming: the Pesce in orange oil was overcooked, the string beans undercooked, and the dish just undersalted in general. It was cold coming out too. The wine list, mediocre. Other that, it's a good place to hang out with family and friends, and the wait staff were all awesome."}
{"text":"Not much to say beyond the huge portions of outstanding pasta. The spaghetti and meatballs has a wonderful sausagy flavor. The wild boar ragu is quite spicy but in a very exceptional way. Lisa, our server, is a reason to come back."}
{"text":"At a lower price point Biaggi's would be a hit, but in Madison there are many more places to get a more unique meal for the same cost or less. The thing that makes it almost worth it: the bread.  I don't know if they fresh bake it or just heat it up or what but sweet pearl it might be the best focaccia I've ever had. Before our last trip I joked that I didn't need to order an entree, I could just eat an entire basket of bread and be happy. PS - that joke is 99% truth.   I've previously only ever had Biaggi's in takeout or leftover form from my parents, and it was good. I particularly liked the chicken piccante stromboli (now only available as a pizza). This time I opted for the farfalle alfredo: peas, carmelized onions, red peppers, and grilled chicken. It also comes with crispy pancetta, but I ordered mine without. I don't care for fatty meat so I decided to just forego it instead of picking it out if it wasn't my jam.   The flavor was good and the predominant flavor outside of the alfredo sauce was the peas. I'm a pea fan, but I was surprised this was the star of the dish. They were also the the only contrasting texture of the dish. Everything else was pretty soft, save the pasta, which was a hair shy of al dente. It probably could have used about one more minute in the water.   While I enjoyed my meal, it just didn't seem worth the nearly $19 I paid with tip for one bowl of pasta - no drinks or dessert or appetizers. There are a couple Italian restaurants in town at similar points that I much prefer so it just doesn't make sense to make this a go-to; I'll pay the premium when I need the focaccia in my life.   Other observations: the interior of their new location is very pretty - they had some killer light fixtures and I liked the vaguely rustic look overall. The tables for two are VERY close together. We were seated right next to another couple and had maybe a foot of space between us. We could definitely hear every word of each others' conversation and it was just awkward. I had a lot of server booty in my face - not her fault at all, there was nowhere else for her to go, but not exactly my idea dining experience.   TL;DR - could live without it except for the bread. I'll take 300 loaves, please."}
{"text":"Good food for a chain.  Fairly pricey.  I had the crab cake app, and the chicken Alfredo dinner.  You can tell that most, if not all of the ingredients arrive frozen.  That is how chains work, and this one is no different.  Our server was excellent!!"}
{"text":"My parents favorite restaurant.  Clean.  Classy.  Comfortable.  Good food and great service.   I had the Mediterranean salad with a piece of salmon.  Came with homemade focaccia and olive oil.  Parm cheese.   Server was attentive.   They are soon moving to a new location.  Middleton."}
{"text":"Second time back here and it's safe to say that I'm still obsessed with this place! This time, I had the fettucine with lobster, after the entire basket of bread of course! I came by here on a Wednesday, and I was still surprised that at 6.30pm we still had to wait 45 minutes. But hey, maybe next time I'll just make reservations. The interior of the restaurant is quite big, and I do enjoy the giant booths they have. Needless to say, as I live a short distance away, I will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free menu and service.  Had a wonderful celebration lunch here while visiting my parents.  Something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"I always seem to want to go back to a restaurant when the service is exceptional. Every visit at Biaggi's I always find the staff very friendly from the first minute you step into the restaurant to the last minute you step out.   Biaggi has an extensive wine menu to compliment your entree. Some of the entrees are a hit or a miss however, the desserts are delicious. My friend ordered a scallion special off the menu which was came in a delicious sauce and I had the penne sardi which was alright (there was too much going on with the bread crumbs and the caramelized onions). I would recommend getting the white chocolate banana pudding for the dessert.   Overall, I would recommend going to place again for their great staff even though the food is a little pricey."}
{"text":"Came in here earlier tonight for a dinner it wasn't very busy when we came in but everything was clean and we were craving Italian so we both pretty excited   The bread left a lot to be desired as the 'most popular' that's baked with Parmesan was overbearingly salty. I guess it was okay though because we weren't filled up for the rest of the order  I tried the Scallop Risotto and it was wonderful the scallops were seared to perfection, however the best part was the few pieces of cranberries in there definitely helped bring all the flavors together in my opinion.  For dessert I got the bread pudding and I wasn't disappointed I left nothing on the plate!   Overall after a slow start the meal ended up being very good!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service, portions, ambiance, prices/quality ratio... all-around tough to beat!"}
{"text":"So good! The lobster fettuccine and the crab cannelloni is AMAZING. It's a solid, Italian food experience with tons of bread, cheese, and olive oil."}
{"text":"I only stopped here because it's close my hotel and I'm feeling particularly lazy. It only had 3.5/5 stars on Yelp, which would turn me away normally, but again LAZINESS took over. The food is good but not addictively amazing. But that did not stop Bob (server) from making the experience amazing. Noticing I was dining alone he asked where I was visiting from and immediately talked about news from my town and it felt really good. Glad to know that a tired server would take the time to make a visitor feel at home. Thank you Bob! You ARE the 5 star of this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was really good, but took off one star because it was nothing special.  The prices were fair, and I will definitely return here.  In my opinion, way better choose than Olive Garden"}
{"text":"this has become a traditional place for my friends and i to celebrate birthdays.  it's on the way to the Savoy 16 theatre which is usually playing some chick flick we decide to see after dinner.  anyway, just went on Sunday evening for just such a celebration we saw the holiday with jude law, kate winslet, jack black, and cameraon diaz and all loved it. anyway, i had the mesina salad which is basically spinach, feta, red onion, tomatoes, cucumbers, kalamata olives, and a delicious dressing.  It's a perfect meal to save room for buttery, salty, popcorn for dessert.  other dishes of note here: tomato sherry bisque, chilean sea bass (although husband tells me it's totally uncool to still have such a thing on the menu considering their population is at risk), creme brule.  in the summer ask to sit outside on the patio, it's lovely."}
{"text":"I usually go to Biaggi's whenever I am in town. Biaggi's is my go to \"chain\" restaurant, where I know I will get a good meal. Great bread and I have yet to be disappointed in any meals. I wish they would offer regular ice tea, instead of their flavored one, which I can't stand. They also have good specials."}
{"text":"Long wait for bill, and with my 4 year old appraching meltdown status, I caught the eye of the manager, who swooped in and saved the day.  We love to eat here because my son loves the mac and cheese with a scoop of ice cream, and I get to eat some real food- so it's a good compromise. But, when a large party was being seated in our section as our server was just delivering drinks to the table nearby, my son started wondering loudly if he would ever get the promised ice cream.  The manager was wonderful- He jumped in and within a minute we had the ice cream, take out box, and bill.    We come here a couple of times of month. The strawberry lemonade is delicious, and there are lots of healthy options on the menu- Great salads and they willingly substitute marinara sauce for the fettuccini alfredo that accompanies many dishes.    I am a fan of a louder, busy atmosphere, which this restaurant has- It's always busy. It is a great way for families to get out to a nice dinner where the white tablecloths are covered with paper for coloring on.  The service on this visit was not as good as usual, but it was just a timinig issue and not at all the server's fault. The manager saved the experience by jumping in and getting us taken care of like he did.  The curbside take out is fast and easy too. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"I know, I know, this is 4 stars for a chain Italian restaurant in Champaign, Illinois?  Well, when you go with little expectation and those expectations are exceeded on nearly every point, it's worth an extra star or two!  I won't belabor all the details, but the place was bustling and our server was conscientious and helpful.  The wine list was surprisingly extensive and we enjoyed a little-known (to me) \"Lemberger\" red wine from Austria.  Light, almost pinot noir-like.  Very nice.  The appetizers were pretty good - fried calamari was crisp and tender but a very small portion.  The seafood arancini were not very good.  I had the spinach salad which was a bit oily but delicious.  For my main course, I had the special Tuscan cassoulet which was a hearty and savory braise of beans, rabbit sausage, chicken and duck confit.  It was simply delicious, not something I would expect at a chain Italian restaurant.  Such an unexpected treat - I think I can still taste it!  My dinner companions generally enjoyed their food as well.  Our desserts were competently executed including tiramisu, chocolate cake, and bananas foster (no flambe though)."}
{"text":"Pretty great although it doesn't seem much different from Olive Garden.  Similar atmosphere.  Perhaps the menu is somewhat more authentic?  When I went, I ordered two appetizers instead of an entree just because I found them more appealing than the entrees.  The real reason why I'm reviewing Biaggi's is because our server was INCREDIBLE.  Probably the best server I've ever had.  I'm not exaggerating.  Go check it out.  EDIT: I just ate at Biaggis again for graduation.  The place was packed and extremely busy.  We had a reservation and they sat us right on time (that's a first!).  Our server was again absolutely wonderful and attentive.  Despite being so crowded and hectic, Biaggis did a great job managing it."}
{"text":"I usually pass on restaurant week. Restaurants are usually to busy to serve their best food or service. Today friends and I decided to give Biaggi's a chance to prove me wrong. The menu was just too good to pass up.   I wanted to order all the appetizers so we decided we would each order one and share. Excellent idea!.   The carpaccio was very good. Small pieces of raw beef mixed with fresh arugula, capers and a light vinaigrette.   The Arancini were nicely browned and served with a tangy tarter sauce.  The winner by far was the cream of chicken Florentine soup. It was served in a large bowl and was a lunch in itself. It was nice and velvety with chunks of chicken and a hint of spice. It should be their house soup. That's how good it was.  My friends both had  the chicken Milanese. A chicken breast served with artichokes in a lemon butter sauce with mashed potatoes. It was very good.  My pasta with sausage in a tomato vodka sauce was a hit. Huge portion with spicy sausage, al dente pasta in a creamy sauce. What's not to love?  The dessert selection was tiramisu, gingerbread pudding or butterscotch pudding. The gingerbread pudding was over the top. Very gingery with a toffee sauce. My only complaint is that I couldn't finish it.  This was the best $15.00 lunch I've ever had. And, I have leftovers to enjoy tomorrow."}
{"text":"I keep asking myself, \"Self? Why didn't you just stick with your reservation at Fresco rather than going to Biaggi's\"? Then I remember suddenly that I am lazy. Well, actually I didn't feel like going downtown even though it's much closer to my house than Biaggi's. I will never forgive myself for this decision.  The night started with my boyfriend calling to make to see how long of a wait there was. We wanted a heads up before we got there to find it was a 45 minutes waiting time. We were told about 15 minutes so we asked to reserved a table.    Get there about 20 minutes later and approx 60% of the restaurant was actually occupied. I highly doubt that in the 20 minutes we drove there, the restaurant suddenly cleared out meaning, we should have been seated immediately and didn't actually need to RSVP a table. The hostess could have made this known to us.   Anyway, get seated and our server seemed like she was too busy to take the time to break and actually, you know... serve. Considering she only had 3-4 tables from what I could see, I am not sure what her rush was.  Boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which he seemed to be OK with. I ordered the Baked Penne Sardi. Absolutely disgusting. The sun dried tomato cream sauce was extremely watery and had no seasoning or flavor. Cream sauces should not be watery based. They are thick! Now, I am not one who likes a lot of salt but I had to load the pasta with salt and pepper to even find it the slightest bit tasteful which didn't seem to resolve my problem. After 5 bites, I was done. I pushed my plate to the side.   I would have made my dislike of the dish known to waitress but she seemed to avoid our table. She didn't even bring our meal out to us. Another server did. When she did come by, she could have commented on my dish still being practically untouched. She looked at the dish, asked if everything was OK and before I could even answered, she picked up the plate and was headed off. Poor service. Poor food. My only reason for giving it 2 stars is the location and decor. Parking lot sucks but considering the restaurants wasn't even close to being full (despite what the hostess stated to us over the phone!), we easily found a park.  I feel inclined to give Biaggis another go but it will take a lot of me to return. Now that I think about it, Fazoli's would have been a much better option over Biaggi's.  Shame on me for being lazy and not sticking with Fresco."}
{"text":"GREAT Italian restaurant. Started in bloomington IL and has now spread throughout the midwest. I am yet to have a pasta dish that I didn't love. Their delicious homemade bread and oil/pepper/parmesan they put out on the tables before your entrees is reason enough to come. I would say its closest competitor/comparison would be Olive Garden, but you get a higher quality meal at a slightly lower price here.  One great option is getting a half-portion (my dates here have always loved this) where you can get a half-portion of your favorite pasta for 8.99. And it is more than enough to fill up most ladies! I highly recommend Biaggi's for a date night or nice family dinner.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the noise. They have never done a great job of sound-proofing their restaurants and during peak hours it can get quite noisy."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place and the chef in charge. The manager really knows how to make people feel at home and the wine list and specials of the day are impeccable. If you are looking for a top notch dining experience this is the place you want to come. Need to impress the new client? Want to impress a date? Come to this place and you will work as if you are not only a foodie but no your stuff when it comes to wine and complex cocktails. Your contact behind the bar: His Nickname is \"Magic\"(John) and he can make pretty much any cocktail you heard of or searched online but let him make you something special from his reserve. Can you say mixologist? Chief: Estabon Martinez might very well be the most underrated talent in the United States."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to this lovely place. We started with stuffed mushrooms shared by my hubby and I and they were very well done and flavorful. Our first course was a different story. Hubby had the minestrone soup and couldn't eat it because of an over use of some herb that was overpowering and not pleasant. Our waiter appeared disappointed that he didn't finish his soup but after we explained the issue he took the soup away but not off our bill, which he really should have done.  My salad was under dressed and and the house vinaigrette was not very flavorful.  Our entrees  more than made up for the disappointing first course.  Both were extremely good bordering on orgasmic!  Hubby had the 4 cheese ravioli and I had the Chicken Marsala and we are still talking about how wonderful each was!!  Definitely will go back.l"}
{"text":"The food definitely isn't bad, but definitely isn't authentic Italian or the best Italian you can get in that price range. I'd call it strip mall Italian that's a few notches higher than Olive Garden.   The appetizers were nice restaurant meets Midwest county fair, which doesn't mean they weren't good. We had bacon wrapped dates, fried ravioli and stuffed mushrooms. I was less impressed with the pasta (I got one of the specials which had a Gorgonzola cream sauce and pretty dry prosciutto) . It wasn't bad at all, it just wasn't that much better than a good freezer aisle pasta dish.   I wouldn't say avoid this place, but when there are a million other affordable restaurants in Madison I'm not sure why this would be someone's first pick."}
{"text":"I don't want to like this place - it's a chain, strip mall type place that doesn't really feel like it belongs in the quaint town of Madison.  But some of the food is fantastic.  Order this: split wedge salad (large chunks of blue cheese, bacon, blue cheese dressing, tomatoes, and onions poured over a chunk of iceberg), and the penne porcini (penne pasta with a rich cream garlic mushroom sauce, with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes).  You'll not only love your meal, you'll come back the next weekend.  The service is also praise-worthy....I challenge anyone who goes here to finish their drink before another one arrives.....(for those drinks with free refills).  Free bread too....but they got rid of a dark (maybe wheat?) bread that was actually the best of all of the breads.  The focaccia is good, but can sometimes be stale.  The white bread might as well be newspaper, it's flavorless.  Dip it in some olive oil, drenched with parmasean cheese, and you probably won't be able to tell the difference."}
{"text":"I again tried the CU location and the service is HORRIBLE!!!!  It had been 2 years so I thought I would give it another try. They got 1 speed...SLOW!  The last trip I called the manager.  Today I talked to the manager.  He could care less:(. Never going again which is too bad because the food is fine once you get to order and it eventually comes:("}
{"text":"This is a nice chain you can go to if you want something similar to Maggiano's.  It's cheap (for ~$10/entree).. it's okay.. but it's not anything special.  It's not really awesome Italian or anything.  In fact, the tiramisu is the same as the one they use at Olive Garden.  I also heard that this place doesn't cook any of their food.. it's just frozen food heated up.  I'm not sure if it's true though.  Sometimes the place is so packed so I would really recommend a reservation.  It's on Open Table.  If you must eat here.. I would recommend the duck confit and perhaps the chocolate bread pudding.  What is horrible would be the mussel appetizer.  Disgusting and not fresh at all!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant but, the consistency is really lacking lately.   The last time I was here my friends mom got the pasta and meatballs, and the meatballs were cold! The time I visited before that, my grandmother got the same thing, pasta and meatballs, and her meatballs were missing, until we mentioned it and they brought then out separately. How do you forget 50 percent of the ingredients in a dish? It's in the name.    On top of that, the flavor of the dishes has really been lacking too, there was no seasoning added to most of the dishes, or so it seemed. Even the chunks of garlic in my pasta did not taste like anything last time we were there. I suppose they boiled the garlic for a few hours first, so as not to offened someone or something (???).   Overall, they could use a lot more flavor and consistency in the dishes being served, especially with the higher end prices they charge and thr neighboring competition they face around CU."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Biaggi's since it's move to Greenway station, and I will certainly be back! While some may feel the new interior design takes away from the Italian dining experience, I for one am a huge fan of Biaggi's new modern look; from the white brick walls to the chic light fixtures, it's like a whole new restaurant. Moreover, our waitress couldn't have been more attentive or friendly.  Biaggi's is the only local restaurant where my Celiac sister doesn't have to feel excluded during pre-meal bread. Biaggi's bakes fresh gluten-free bread to order and offers a great selection of gluten-free entrees - my sister's favorite being the cheese pizza.  I opted for the light menu's veggie risotto to which I added chicken. I could have easily felt cheated considering the amount of heavy (and surely delicious) pastas also available, but I'd order the same in an instant! You might be thinking the reason it's considered healthy is it's a tiny serving, but that is not the case at all. Finally, the crunch of the steamed veggies complemented the creaminess of the risotto perfectly, and the chicken added a nice chew."}
{"text":"Great,  slightly more authentic that Olive Garden, Italian.  Great selection of dishes, all tasty, wonderful bread and olive oil. A good solid standard."}
{"text":"Each time I have passed by Biaggi's on the way to or from Willard Airport, I have been intrigued by the building and wanted to check it out. It didn't scream \"chain\" from its outward appearance  so I was a little surprised to learn it is but one of a number of locations in the Midwest. I don't harbor ill will towards a restaurant group necessarily-after all, Maggiano's carries it off well-but Italian cuisine doesn't always get its due in the chain format.  That's why I was gratified by my recent visit here. I think it's a decent choice if you want a little more upscale experience but don't mind spending a little more on dinner. The restaurant has a very intimate feel with dim lighting, dark woods, and plenty of booth space. Music is kept at a subtle level so you can enjoy a quiet date night here. It leans toward dressy but casual attire is not out of place. Once you are seated, you can enjoy the crusty bread dipped in olive oil and parmesan cheese that is kept on every table.   We passed on the alcoholic beverages for this visit, but they have a fairly broad list of wines. The menu is extensive with both seafood and meat selections typical of an Italian experience. We started with the calamari fritti, which came out light and crispy as it should and served with a marinara and one other sauce (I think an aioli). It was a generous portion and you could almost make a meal out of it. For entrees, we had a capellini di mare, a nice mix of scallops, shrimp, clams, and mussels on a bed of angel hair past. The spicy marinara was plenty hot but just slightly on the bland side and could have benefited with a bit more seasoning. We also enjoyed haddock stuffed with crab and served with seasonal vegetables. I want to mention that all of the seafood was cooked perfectly-no rubbery shrimp to be found. The green beans were too al dente for me though. Dessert course consisted of the chocolate cake, an extremely rich and most concoction, and my favorite, a lemon tower layer cake.  Service was relentless and almost on the verge of being too attentive, but I'll take that any day over being ignored. We never had to wait for either bread or drinks, and food came at a good pace out of the kitchen. I felt pretty welcome here.   Overall, this is a comfortable joint with very large portions, so you're not going to leave hungry. I think four stars is in reach for this restaurant. My only small knocks were that the prices were on the high side and that the execution of menu needs just a bit of sharpening. Still, I think it's a great choice to visit and I'll be back. Recommended."}
{"text":"The service was ok when I went there for lunch with a friend but wow the kitchen took forever.  Considering I only ordered the soup and salad combo and my friend ordered a salad it should have been ready in minutes.  Instead we waited around 20 minutes on a weekday in a barely crowded restaurant. The fried ravioli was pretty good as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are such polarized reviews on this restaurant - I would say that this place is a fairly standard Italian restaurant with some pros and some cons.   They definitely try to be more upscale, which was nice for appearance/ambiance sake, but some items are definitely pricier than you would expect them to be.   To start off, the complimentary bread was delicious! Honestly, my favorite part of the whole meal. I ordered the Chicken Pietro which was good, but nothing special. My friends weren't particularly thrilled about their dishes either. Definitely sizable portions though, so you could easily take home leftovers and have two meals for the price of one.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal but wasn't blown away. The service was quick and friendly, and I did like the decor of the restaurant. We did have to wait a decent amount (~45 minutes-1 hour) at 7 PM on a Friday night, so make sure to make reservations for larger parties!"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I went to the new location for Biaggi's. The decor is nice and very open. We received mostly good service although I felt that my waiter was very focused on my husband and not so focused on me. The calamari was pretty good but it was a little too salty. My spaghetti and meatballs were tasty and husband's chicken parmesan was good as well. In the end, I just wasn't wowed. I will probably give them another chance after they have been at the new location a bit longer."}
{"text":"I love biaggi's.  I'd say for fine italian dining, they are very cheap.  Their pastas are very fairly priced with very appropriate portions.  I especially love their lobster linguine or fettuccine.. SO good.  I'm also a big fan of their carpaccio which is large enough to be a meal in itself.  They have good fried calamari and salad, too.  They have very good service, very friendly.  I've been back multiple times."}
{"text":"Always a consitent, great meal.  The service is excellent - we've always had really friendly staff.  I LOVE the beat salad and the mushroom pasta special (served only at lunch)."}
{"text":"It's delicious, sure.  And, whoa, are those cloth napkins?  Just because every student, sick of dorm food, brings the parents here for \"something special\" doesn't make it exceptional. It lacks character, as most chain's do. What's so great about the place?  Try some real local flavor - go to downtown Champaign or Urbana and support your local businesses."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is overpriced. I ordered a ribeye steak and paid $20.99. It was mediocre at best. I've had far better ribeye's for less than $15. The French Onion soup was excellent but cost $6.99. A house salad was $4.99. And a cup of coffee was $2.79."}
{"text":"there aren't a lot of nice restaurants in champaign, but i think this place does the trick.   if you are like chicken, then the chicken marsala is a must! it was the best marsala that i've had...anywhere.   their prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly.  check it out~"}
{"text":"I had an ex-girlfriend going to school at U of I who used to always talk about this place, but I never got a chance to go. But I went there with my girlfriend (now wife) around October/November of 2007.   First, the wait staff: These people are always great to deal with. They're nice and friendly and always seem so upbeat. Makes the whole dining experience that much better.   The drinks: I'm a Jameson fan, so there's really not much you can mess up on there, but my wife seems to love the wine so I'll take her word for it. Haven't tried anytihng else though.  The food: One word, GREAT. Obviously, being an italian restaurant, I expected the food to be bland, but oh my god, was it good! Its got flavor and they'll go out of their way to change the dishes to your tastes (in my case, SPICY).   Great place overall, but what makes it so good is the wait staff. I can't tell you how important this small thing is for me because it can seriously make or break a lot of restaurants.   I believe there is a Biaggi's in Naperville also, although I haven't tried them out yet so I really can't say much, but one day (I mean hell, it is a lot closer than Champaign!)."}
{"text":"I've loved Biaggi's for a long time. However, this time was a disappointment. Service was ok. Food was below average.  Carbonara, chicken salad, Mac n cheese, and house salad all had no flavor. Too much dressing on the salads along with lack of flavor had us lose our appetite.  Definitely finding a new Italian restaurant next time."}
{"text":"More than a restaurant it's our favorite dessert place. Almost every dessert is absolutely amazing. All stars because of desserts. Food is fine. Service is good. Breads could have been better. Ambience is very nice.  Mixed feelings !"}
{"text":"We love the ambiance and food at Biaggi's. Our first choice when it comes to Italian in C-U. Fresh produce, expertly made by chefs, and staff that goes the extra mile to satisfy the customer. Pasta fra Diablo and Veal Parm are 2 dishes that we love along with their bruschetta and molten lava cake. Casual attire or dressed up it's the perfect place for Italian."}
{"text":"Standard Italian fare. My table of three started with a large caesar salad, which there was plenty of to go around, and the stuffed mushroom appetizer. I enjoyed their Caesar dressing, it's pleasantly spicy and creamy. The stuffed mushrooms were also pretty good. For entrees, everyone at my table ordered the Capellini Di Mare. The saucing was a little inconsistent across the three plates. Mine was a bit watery while the other two seemed a bit drier. The pasta was a little soggy. Also, all of us had 1-2 closed mussels. Disappointed that they didn't notice this during plating and served us inedible mussels. However, they were nice and brought us out some fresh ones to replace them. Other than the saucing inconsistencies and the mussel fiasco, the portions were huge and the dish was for the most part good. Overall, my dinner at Biaggi's was just okay, but I knew what to expect coming to the chain Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"So I came back here a little impulsively for yet another date night. It really is a great spot to bring your significant other. Good food that is perhaps a little pricey but definitely a step above most other chain places like Olive Garden.  We came in on a Wednesday and the place seemed to be fairly crowded, but it's big on the inside so luckily we didn't have to wait at all.  We kept it simple as usual and just ordered 2 entrees between us. We took advantage of the interchangeable sauces and noodles on some of the dishes. I got the farfalle alfredo but substituted the sauce for the lobster cream sauce, while she got a Bolognese with fettuccine noodles and red sauce. Mine was quite tasty, the chicken breast was cooked perfectly and had a good texture to it, the pancetta chunks added a nice texture, and the lobster sauce, although perhaps a little too soupy, added a nice seafood touch to the dish. She said the Bolognese was also very good.  The service was spectacular. Our server Jake was particularly friendly and humorous. He had a very strong knowledge of the menu, specials, recommendations, etc. I felt bad we are pretty basic diners and don't really ask too many questions or even order more than just entrees. What a great guy!  Overall, a good experience at Biaggi's, I'll definitely come again to try something else."}
{"text":"I guess this is the fancy Italian chain restaurant.  While it is better than say Olive Garden or Carrabbas, that is not saying much.  On top of that it is just to expensive for what you get.  That fake, country rustic vibe is prevalent throughout.    Service is cheerful and peppy.  For a large group they did fine.  Everything from the kitchen came out at the same time.  Which is professional, though some things were cold.  Understandable, but I wish places like this would just bring the food out when it is hot.  Maybe I am alone in that regard, because most places will do this.  Anyway, that really is not a big deal.  They shout from the highest high top table that everything is freshly made or sourced here.  If that is true, they need better sources or they need to make better pasta.  Just the typical over stuffed pasta dishes that are found in most Italian places.  The scallops are bad.  Rubbery, chewy, and flavorless.  The salads are not that good...the dreaded and bland Caesar, house, and wedge.  Calamari is dry, rubbery, and flavorless.  Average wine list, and a crappy beer list.  Both pretty typical for such a place.    There are not a lot of great options for Italian in Champaign/Urbana/Savoy.  This place certainly has that faux chain look that draws people in by the masses.  Which is probably why they have been open for so many years.  Though just an upscale Olive Garden.  Manzella's is about the same, with a much friendlier, welcoming vibe (if a bit dated), and better bang for your buck IMO."}
{"text":"Great food. We went there on one of our first dates. Didn't know it was Prom night. Had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table. The food was wonderful. The appetizers were great."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meat balls comes in a big portion and delicious, pork chop was good, the stripe Marlin fish with horseradish had almost none horseradish, salad are very good. Excellent service! coffee was only warm and chocolate cake was non acceptable for high end Italian restaurant.   BTW- Tilapia is farm raise."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awful. I came here after hearing good things about it from a few people. BF and I were both sorely disappointed. The service was good and the ambiance was nice, but the food was bad and overpriced.  1) Our bread was NOT cooked! Seemed pillow-y at first look, but was literally dough once you bit into it.  2) I ordered a chicken pasta dish, and the chicken was breaded and fried. This was not mentioned on the menu (had it been, I wouldn't have ordered it), and I have never had Italian food that had FRIED food in the pasta. Needless to say, it was pretty terrible.  3) BF's dish was mediocre at best. We paid ~$40 for 2 pasta dishes and one soda.   Maybe we ordered the wrong things or went on a bad day, but I'm not willing to go again to find out. For Italian food that's barely mediocre, this place is way overpriced. Save your money and your stomach and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Rolled into Champaign at around 9 on a cold January night. The town looked like a ghost town. The restaurant was quite empty, so I was leery of the food quality and freshness; however, this place was surprisingly very good. The server was courteous and helpful. I ordered a Greek salad and a chicken parmigiana. The salad was DELICIOUS and plentiful. It almost could have been a meal. The parmigiana was PK, not the greatest, but it served its purpose and it was \"hot\". Something very important many restaurant servers overlook - \"guys, the food needs to be hot when you serve it\". The place looks nice with Frank and Dino playing in the background... I recommend this place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The food was excellent as usual however the waitress needs to improve on her personality. Her service was excellent but she wasn't very warm or friendly."}
{"text":"Upper echelon Italian at least for C-U. Never had a bad meal here, maybe a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Biaggi's for my birthday a couple months ago and I loved it!   The service was great, nice wine list, and the bread - YUM! I loved the ambiance. We sat in a cozy booth. Very fair prices.  I loved their menu. What impressed me the most was that they offer small plates - even at dinner time! Many places offer a lunch portion, but don't offer that at dinner. Loved that.   I had the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni and it was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend had the Squid Ink Fettuccini- just as good. I also had the lemon cream float martini - so good!   Impressed and we will be back!"}
{"text":"It is a chain and like all the rest. Over-priced, ok food."}
{"text":"Biaggi's was the place to go if you were a U of I student and wanted to take your family members to a 'nice' restaurant in the area; it was also perfect for dates and was always packed on Valentine's Day.  This place is a cut above Olive Garden...the food never disappoints and the service is fantastic!  Prices are reasonable and I always left feeling full and happy (and my wallet didn't suffer either)."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. The open concept main room is fun.  Fried ravioli - 5 stars Baked Ziti al forno - 4 stars ______ Alfredo (with peppers and chicken and bow tie pasta) - 4 stars  I think the sauce could be more flavorful and less runny. Other than that, it was a good night."}
{"text":"Great fried calamari appetizer. It was the best part of the meal. I also liked the soft bread, not so much the hard bread that came before everything. We also ordered the meatball appetizer.  Not my favorite. I did like the grilled bread in olive oil.   I got the crab cake sliders with sweet potato fries.  I liked the fries. There were two sliders that were just ok. Had better crab cakes on the East in DC. They were spicier as left overs.   My friend ordered the chicken Parmesan with pasta. It was a small portion.  Another friend got the half Italian beef sandwich with bacon and vegetable soup. That was a big portion and looked good. The soup was mostly zucchini.   They had a big accessible bathroom stall and a huge parking lot connected to a strip mall.   I would return."}
{"text":"I've never been in the actual restaurant, but I was just at the \"Tase of Madison\" and tried their Italian Beef. IT WAS SO GOOD. Just thought I'd share that, I've been in Madison for 8 years and before that lived in Chicago, I'm fairly young, so I'm sure the Italian Beef isn't as good as Chicago, but for Madison it was pretty darn good. Nice job Biaggis!!!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I went to Biaggi's on a recommendation from a friend.  We were told it was like an upscale Olive Garden.  We had the sea bass and triggerfish, and I thought the food was great, but a little over priced considering the dinner entrees didn't come with a salad. Definitely make a reservation from an weekend dinner, the place was packed and really noisy.  Should have requested a booth for a little more quiet/private feel."}
{"text":"Biaggi's is a my go to place in town for special occasion. A couple years ago, I had a date night with my boyfriend. We had a reservation and promptly got seated. It was a Friday night, and as expected the place was busy. We ordered Wedge salad for appetizer, and I had the capellini di mare. The waiter forgot to give us our salad before the main course. He apologized and gave the salad to us for free. Five minutes after he came back and offered us free dessert!! My boyfriend and I were super satisfied with the service!  Some items I would recommend: - Appetizer: Bacon wrapped dates or the lobster chowder! - Main course: grilled pork chop, capellini di mare, shimp and crab cannelloni -Dessert: hands down the best bread pudding I've ever had.  My only suggestion is to make reservation ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Biaggi's is good. The service is fine. The decor is nice. But... I'm just not enthralled. Given a choice, I'd pick a different restaurant. I'm not really even sure why, other than the overall experience feels a little pretentious and I think the price/value relationship is a bit off.  Maybe it's the lighting?"}
{"text":"Visited this place during greenway station restaurant week. It was a three-course lunch.  Carpaccio: thinly-sliced raw steak nicely seasoned with arugula and asiago cheese  Pork loin with bacon jam: I enjoyed this dish a lot! Pork loin well-cooked and topped with a sweet sauce that triggers every flavor out of the pork. Placed on top of sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes. Yummy!  Tiramisu: MUST TRY!! The best and only tiramisu in Madison."}
{"text":"Very very good Italian food. However, the good food comes with a very steep price. If your looking for a good date night restaurant this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere were excellent. The salad with house dressing is excellent. Rigatoni with Bolognese sauce is to die for. Definitely worth the stop"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review for this establishment since I've been diagnosed with fructose and lactose malabsorption syndrome.  Since then I can no longer eat most things on their menu, including any items with gluten, garlic, and onion.  It leaves few choices, but I've come here 2xs since being diagnoses.  Both times the chef and servers were very accomodating.  I was able to have the gluten-free bread with no spices, the gluten-free pasta di mare with no sauce, and they let me make a gluten-free, lactose-free pizza.  The quality of the food wasn't amazing, especially for the loud atmosphere and what you're paying.  However, I would now recommend this place to others because of their williness to assist thoughs with allergies."}
{"text":"I just ordered pickup as I was passing through the town so I cannot attest to the actual restaurant. However, customer service was friendly and my meal was ready on time. I ordered there Baked Ziti shrimp pasta, butterscotch dessert and vanilla bean gelato! They also provide bread with your meal but be sure to ask for the bruchetta :) yum yum"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. From fantastic service to one of the best Italian meals I ever had.  Stopped in for work travel dinner. The waiter recommended the baked ziti with sausage shrimp and chicken with lobster three cheese Alfredo sauce.  It was perfect. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Middleton."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place to have dinner. The atmosphere is casual and the service is just wonderful. I had the carpaccio and squash ravioli and they were amazing. Price is a little higher than Friday's but trust me, you would want to come here instead."}
{"text":"Capellini de Mare? Spicy and yummy. Large scallops and shrimps sautéed to perfection. I think the thick sauce would work well with angel hair.  Bonnie was sweet and attentive. The patio seating definitely makes the food even more enjoyable. Nice find in Middleton  Oh and the bread? Fluffy heaven"}
{"text":"Biaggi's is a great Italian restaurant on U of I's campus! I have always been a huge fan of this place. I love their chopp salad and the different pasta dishes they have. The bread they bring out before the meal is great and it always has at least three different types to try. The place is huge but if it's a busy weekend-like Mom's weekend you will need a reservation or you will never get in!"}
{"text":"Nice place and great service, but the scallops were terrible (tiny, dry, and chewy little things). The scallops were served with an undercooked, starchy risotto.  The filet mignon was cooked well but could've had a better flavor. Also, it was annoying to eat asparagus that was cut up into tiny pieces, instead of just whole spears.    The best part of the whole meal was the bottle of Moscato we shared and the dessert, a Nutella skillet cookie."}
{"text":"After two years not attending to go to this place, we finally said lets try it again. Our experience last time, was from 1-10  A 3. This time around,  once again ,we had not only the worst waiter, the food had been wrong/expensive and just plain bad tasting.   Drew our waiter had been very busy, his attention span had been a 2. We ordered water which took 15 minutes, upon asking for a straw took a nother 10 minutes. We waited 20 minutes before he came for our order, I ask about the salmon if it was farm or Atlantic,  he said Atlantic,  we preceded to order. He then came and said the salmon was a farm one , which I appreciated him telling me. I ordered the walley supposedly being served with tomato risotto and vegetables in the 18$ price range. When the food came out, I saw a lunch plate ( not dinner) with undercooked fries ( I ordered) on top a 6 inch fish. No vegetables and that for 18$, I asked Drew for the vegetables, also for lemon and tarter sauce.  One out of three I received, starting to eat the fish, I realized the taste was not up to par at all, cold fries made the meal unbearable. I told Drew to take the food away, he ask me if I like something else I said no thank you, my husband had seafood marinara and was unable to eat it, I tasted his food and finished the rest! I ordered coffee with cream, I specifically asked to make sure it's fresh. When he finally came with the coffee the cream was in it. Let's just say,  it was more cream than coffee.  I looked and said , why is there cream in the coffee? The answer I've gotten was , that's how we serve our coffee! What?.. my friend took it from me as I gotten the black coffee which had been cold and Not fresh. I asked Drew to please take coffee back . I do t think he got it what all went wrong.  I must say upon arrival the girl manager ( forgotten her name) recognized me , greeted us and said dessert was on the house! It was a nice gesture to what would happen during our long wait of food ordering. Joshua the manager was friendly until I told him about the numerous mistakes and given advice to retrain Drew . He's friendliness went quickly to a frown and belittling hand shake before we left. Sorry, but Champaign has hundreds of wonderful places to eat, the pressure is on to keep up! I'm saddened once again to have had such terrible experience. Given a free dessert doesn't constitute the rest of the evening being upset over mistakes being made over and over."}
{"text":"I'm actually not a fan of Biaggi's. I think it's a great place to feel like you're better than you really are, or just different from any other family restaurant, but that's only because of the dress code and presentation. The food is fine. Their steaks are high-grade, but usually tough unless they are smothered in some strange sauce that smells, looks, and tastes funky. So you're stuck if you go with or without the sauce. I did enjoy their pork chops, though. Garlic mashed potatoes are tasty, too. Appreciate the bread baskets, but whether or not the bread actually tastes fresh is a touch-and-go issue. I dig the Champaign bartenders, though. Props to those charming folks. Strawberry daquiris are magnificent... They know how to get the tips flowing.   Best way to go with Biaggi's is only use it for gift certificates or spoiling someone else on a birthday. I would never go with a group of friends \"just for fun,\" but I regularly give out their gift cards as thank you gifts."}
{"text":"I went to Biaggi's for the first time last week (Nov), and I had a very pleasant experience.  There were only a few people in the restaurant (we went for a late dinner), so I can't tell you if they get busy or not, but they seemed to have plenty of space.  The environment and service seems to be in line with other franchise restaurants, that is to say nothing special, but I did enjoy the Frank Sinatra music playing and the soft lighting.  The booth we sat at was comfortable as well and our waiter was very nice.  Onto the food though.  The first thing we were treated to was a hefty bread basket which included 2-3 different kinds of bread and our waiter prepared a plate with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and Parmesan cheese which was extremely delicious.  The combination of those three mixed together was enough to make my Italian genes satisfied, but then we were promptly brought out our main courses, both of which were also succulent.  I had the Ravioli Quattro Formaggi and my girlfriend had the Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni.  The Ravioli had an appetizing cream sauce, and the crab had a refined sweet taste.  We both were completely satisfied.  If you're a big Italian food fan, I highly recommend.  My only knocks were that the prices were a little steep for what was offered and the franchise feel of the place, but otherwise the food and service was great which is really what counts."}
{"text":"We came in to check this place out during lunch. It had been over 10 years since I ate at any Biaggi's and this is as wonderful as I remember! They even had my favorite dish: Ziti al Forno!  Mentioned we were watching our lunch time and we were seated, :served and Bill paid and back out the door in 37 minutes! Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review I was for surprised to find a restaurant similar to Maggiano's here down in Champaign, but I finally was able to visit Biaggi's this past weekend. This is a chain restaurant with many locations however it's hidden away from the main strip which is why it has not visited until now. I was smart enough to make a reservation on open table or else you'll end up waiting 20 to 40 minutes for a table. We were quickly seated in a very busy dining room. This restaurant has a variety of Italian food from the pasta's to the meat entrées. The food here is pretty good however the service and the overall flow of the restaurant is terrible. The issues that we had here was that we ordered an appetizer and are entrées at the same time. Unlike other reviewers who complained about slow food, it only take about a few minutes before our appetizer came and literally two minutes afterwards are entrées were place on her table as well. The fried calamari was good and came with two types of dipping sauce. I had the seafood pasta which actually was prepared excellent. I wish it was in a white wine sauce however it came in a spicy red sauce. There was a variety of seafood including scallops that were prepared well grilled shrimp, mussels, and octopus. Along with this meal you get a complementary bread basket which contains a soft bread and baguette which go well with the olive oil and Parmesan cheese dip. Our server was notably absent never filling our glass of water and also not even giving a glass to my son. Finally because it's so busy their goals the quickly turn over your table. We had a reservation at 545 and was done with our meal around 6:20, but there's a constant feeling that they want you to clear the table as it took away our place even before my son finished his meal. For that reason I would have to think long and hard about visiting this restaurant again  Pros: Average prices, good Italian food, free bread and olive oil  Cons: Poor service, seems like they want to rush to get you out, poor timing of food delivery  Hidden deals: Sign up for the email club for special offers  Health code rating: B. Appears to be clean, however health reports they appear to have been the numerous violations http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1004"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick dinner by myself.  All in all decent experience.  The service definitely made up for a lot.   The hostesses, while very polite, seemed a bit over zealous.  There were 2 and they both kept telling me the same things right after another. just seemed a bit \"in your face\".  I had the lobster soup, bread and hot tea to begin with. The soup was fantastic and I loved that they bring out a box of tea for you to choose from. The bread was a bit of a let down, old and cold. As an entrée I had the fettuccine with lobster. While the menu stated chili flakes, there were none.  The dish was just overall bad. Pasta was over cooked while having clumped pieces that were underdone. The real downer was the lobster sauce. It was ruined with the ungodly amount of green onion they used, all I could taste was onion.   My server was David and he was outstanding. Very gracious, offered to take the dish back and get me something else and he would bring up my dislikes at a meeting.   Decent experience,  I would return to try something else possibly and get the soup for sure."}
{"text":"This is THE best Italian restaurant in Madison, hands down.  We have eaten there on 3 occasions and have yet to me disappointed.  The food is phenomenal, service A+, and prices comparable to that of Olive Garden, only better for sure!  If you are planning to have a nice dinner with an SO, this is a great place to go.  Order the Chicken Marsala!!!"}
{"text":"The pre bread  with Olive oil and cheese is yummy.  We tried two signature pasta: Capellini Di mare and Fettuccini with lobster. I love both of them. Fettuccini is more creamy and the other one with herb tomato sauce is more fresh taste. If you are not a butter & cheese fan, you could try this one!  The Tiramisu as a popular coffee-flavored Italian dessert here is a good choice! The mint  makes it more beautiful!   The perfect lunch here is a great deal.

{"text":"Biaggi's is my favorite go-to place for a nice sit down meal in Champaign. I have been there countless times and I have never had a bad experience. I have also tried my fair share of different dishes on their menu and have never been disappointed. I had the chicken parmesan the last time I went in February, but just about anything you order will be delicious. I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time because it can get very crowded especially on the weekends, or even during the weekdays. Sometimes there are different kinds of events and people may go to Biaggi's in a big group afterwards so it doesn't hurt to be on the safe side and make a reservation."}
{"text":"I have never been to Biaggi's and will likely never return. My sister and I stopped in tonight for dinner probably 8:30-9:00. It was not busy at all... We stood at the door for close to 10 minutes. I understand later at night that there generally is no hostess working,  but during this time several wait staff looked at us and saw us waiting but instead chose to ignore us. One girl even looked straight at us and walked behind the bar to drink a beer and chat with coworkers. Terribly disappointing as we were excited to give it a try."}
{"text":"We had a reservation at Biaggis we were meeting friends, we happened to arrive a little early so They wanted to seat us immediately.  Our table was in a very undesirable location.  When we asked to be moved they said we would have to wait 30-40 minutes.  We stayed at the original table being assured that our friends would be directed to our table when they arrived. well 15 minutes later when we went to check our friends were sitting on the bench and had been told we had not arrived yet.   We are hopeful they can get organized and treat there customers with more respect."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times but each time has been a great experience. The customer service here is outstanding. The staff really seem to want to make you happy. This place can get really busy though so I'm sure they can't all be perfect all the time. I prefer going for lunch versus dinner time anyways.  The food is pretty good and definitely better tasting than a certain other Italian chain in town. The pasta is always cooked perfectly and if I get fish it's always moist and tender and tastes pretty fresh. Prices are reasonable (but that doesn't mean cheap). The restaurant itself looks really nice. My favorite part is that the tables are covered in paper and they give my kids crayons to keep them busy long enough for my hubby and I to enjoy our meal relatively peacefully. Also, the kids' menu looks pretty good even though we only get the mac n' cheese for the little ones. Note:  the kids' mac n' cheese is NOT from a box (I think). It has swirly pasta and a homemade-tasting cheese sauce that my kids love, and we like it too!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. Good place for a dinner meeting. The wait staff did a great job. Our server was a bit odd, but, can't fault his ability .  Appetizers were good as well!!"}
{"text":"I realize this place is a chain, but still, I love it. I just went back here last weekend and had to update my review and give it a fifth star.  Their bread is just so yummy and I could honestly make a meal out of it. I also found that their lasagna (all 8 layers of it) is reallllly good. I usually try to order something new every time I go to a restaurant, but this lasagna has me hooked. But, if I can tear myself away from the lasagna, or rather, any of the pasta dishes, I've found the salads are pretty great and they're HUGE. The wedge is one of my favorites, but any of them are really good, actually.  The iced tea is also suuuper good, and so is the strawberry lemonade. There are mashed strawberries in it and it's perfectly sweet and tart. I love it.  Also, the nuttela skillet cookie with ice cream, holy cow. Make sure you order it, but do it early because it takes about 10 minutes to make. It's worth the wait though. It's phenomenal!  I also can't review this place without saying how nice the staff has always been here. Everyone is very polite, very proper, and you feel comfortable here wether you're in jeans and a shirt for a lunchbreak or here for a fancy dinner. It's just good for any occasion.  Basically yeah, I feel kind of stupid ranting and raving about a chain restaurant, but it really is one of my favorite places in Champaign and I'm reminded of that every time I go here."}
{"text":"YOU MUST CHECK OUT THE NEW BIAGGIS!  We liked the previous Biaggi's but parking was a complete hassle and the interiors felt a little too traditional for us.  The new location is stellar, and the space has a fresh and open feel with a mix of contemporary design without feeling stark.  We have been to the new location at least three times and the food is as good if not better than the old place.  I love their beet salad, lobster corn chowder, and chicken parmesan.  Their bartenders, Nikki and John, are some of the best in town hence the reason we usually sit in the bar for dinner.  Order a blueberry sage martini and you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"It was a quieter Friday afternoon according to our server who was incredibly polite and chatty.  Yet, not in your face chatty.  The bread served with olive oil and cheese was warm, soft and hot.  Absolutely amazing.  We ordered the crab cakes which were light with a fresh pepper mix.  My dinner was baked ziti with chicken, shrimp in a creamy lobster sauce.  I was also covered in mozzarella.  It really was amazing, but heavy.  The menu does have lighter options and good looking salads  Parking was great, the place was comfortably laid out and like I said the service was good.  It's not quite a handmade pasta place, we are in WI so the shrimp wasn't caught today, but it did well."}
{"text":"I really like biaggi's; the atmosphere in there is kind of a salving balm to the grody campus or slut-tacular downtown vibe.  It's clean and more refined than most other places you'll find in champaign, with good service and a lot of edible dishes.  It's true what everyone else is saying; there's nothing impressive about the food.  I've never had anything bad though, and I actually think the prices are highly reasonable given the amount and quality of food and the atmosphere in which it is presented.  You NEED a reservation for dinner if you are going to wait for less than an hour on the weekend."}
