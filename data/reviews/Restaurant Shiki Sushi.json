{"text":"Great option for BYOB. Their specialities are very well done and taste amazing. The titanic was my favourite."}
{"text":"Given that there are very few really good sushi places in Montreal, this is among the better ones. The fish was fresh tasting and substantial, the prices were fine, and the service was good. I didn't go for BYOB this time but that's a great perk and will most certainly bring a bottle whenever I go back. One warning: they rely very heavily on fried and cooked ingredients for their futomakis, so if you're more into fresh fish then you should stick to the sushi/sashimi or go elsewhere. Otherwise, this good and satisfying place."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp tempura dish served with rice. The amount was more than I expected and I could not finish it in the end. The vegetable tempura had only sweet potatoes and eggplants, for me this was a downside: I prefer different varieties of vegetable tempura. But overall the tempura was very delicious  without strong oil taste. The sushi my friends ordered was also very tasty. A standard Japanese restaurant with standard quality. The price is reasonable and the good thing is we can bring our own wine."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé parce que c'est très près de chez moi. C'est la seule raison. Et ça restera la seule.  Prix un peu élevé pour le niveau de la bouffe qui est juste basique.  Le fait que ce soit un Apporte ton vin sauve ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Bon service, même avec un groupe. Apportez votre vin. Très bon sushi. Bel atmosphère. Décor intéressant. Un bel endroit pour avoir une longue conversation."}
{"text":"Bon resto pour le midi si vous travaillez dans le coin, bon service, courtois et rapide, prix très corrects et bouffe très bonne! Il y a des sushis mais aussi d'excellents plats comme du pad thai, poulet general tao, etc."}
{"text":"It might have been a stroke of bad luck, because the place was filled with a large birthday party, but this was hands down the *worst* service I've ever experienced. Ever!  Nope, it wasn't actually bad luck - it was that they were understaffed for the event and the service at our table was the equivalent of abandonment.  We didn't even get our menus for at least 20-25 minutes after being seated, and when we were finally able to order, our food didn't come for a very long time, almost to the point of us nearly walking out. In fact, the food came right as we were getting ready to leave. What this meant was that we sat staring at our glasses of water for an hour.   Oh, they also have NOTHING to drink at this restaurant and I'm not just talking alcohol. It's a BYOB, which we didn't realize, but I would have been fine if they'd at least had some tea, juice or something, ANYTHING, to drink. Nada. Not one single thing. Staring at a glass of water, with an empty stomach, for an hour. Plus, our server couldn't care less.  When our order did come, it wasn't our complete order - our server forgot to bring the rice that came with our flavourless tempura dish. The sashimi (we're talking basic slices of raw fish - no cooking required) took OVER an hour. That's a lot of knife sharpening... or something. Our server was not even remotely apologetic.   Terrible experience overall, and the food was really not worth it. Definitely stay away from the tempura - really overpriced and tasteless."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this resto since I live right around the corner AND it's a BYOW but, it fell a bit flat. Maybe it's because I usually order sushi from another place (Bonsa sushi) within a couple of feet of Shiki Sushi and my \"go to place\" holds a special place in my heart but I felt as though Shiki was missing something. The sushi was fresh, yes, but I didn't enjoy the fact that they didn't seem to have \"normal\" sushi. Most makis had an ingredient in it that I usually tend to avoid when ordering. Many had fruit or a milk based dipping sauce in it. I can see why people enjoy it however, I won't go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Une bonne qualité et variété à un prix juste. Vous pouvez aussi apporter votre vin. Le décor et l'ambiance sont décontractés comme pour un souper entre amis."}
{"text":"Un bon sushi à Montréal , un peu cher cependant rapport qualité/prix.  Ambiance décontracté. Un endroit où passer un bon moment entre amis.  Jamais de déception, une valeur sûre."}
