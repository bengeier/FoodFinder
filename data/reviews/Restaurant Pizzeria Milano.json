{"text":"I'm sure this isn't the worse restaurant in Saint-Jerome but it is amongst the worst I have been to. The inside of the restaurant still smells like an old ashtray from the clientele that frequented it back in the days when smoking was allowed in public places. The pizza that I ordered had raw onions on it which also taste of cigarette smoke and were warm at the most, having spent very little time in the oven. The tomato pizza sauce had an over-powering taste of fennel or anise, either of which makes an awful combination in pizza (in my opinion).

After dinner I asked the waitress what their specialties were, to my surprise she warned me to stay away from their smoked meat (not a good sign when even the staff doesn't like the food they serve), and then boasted that their pizza was recognized as one of the best in Saint-Jerome.

As another reviewer pointed out, I also noticed their menu spelled Scotch whisky \"Skotch\"... What a classy joint. 

I wish I could say something positive about this restaurant, but the fact is that I will never be going back."}

The customer service sucks."}
