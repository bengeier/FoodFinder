{"text":"Love this place and the whole experience! The service used to be extremely fast but has decreased in the last few months. The food is impeccable and the menu is original"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:00 A.M. Sunday morning, while waiting for a friend to show I had several choices of an outside table. Not the most picturesque patio but it certainly beats the clamorous cafeteria style of the interior. The wall of cut popular trees helps remarkable well in hiding the parking lot just inches away. The waiters and waitresses were quick, attentive, friendly, helpful and busier than buzzards on a carcass. The tables were speedily cleaned and somehow the coffee cup (most importantly) never saw the bottom. While there (10-12:00), I observed several (over a two hour period) long lines of people (mostly groups of four to six) waiting for tables who'd first arrived around 10:30. For the most part the people were quickly seated as tables became available. It was a great summers Sunday morning of a long weekend and everyone was in great spirits waiting patiently for their turn at the trough. If possible, arrive closer to 10:00 especially if you want to be outside.  My friend had the mushroom omelet that was at least two large eggs with a good smattering of sautéed mushrooms. The egg was done to perfection, light, buttery, not a singe mark to be seen. I would've liked to have seen a little more finesse though. An omelet should encompass its main component by being folded over. Sautéing the mushrooms in fresh garlic and chive with a small amount of smoked salt would've been ideal. However, his report is that it was a tasty omelet and that is what counts most. The plate was heaped with a Mont Saint-Sauveur size helping of browned potato which was nicely seasoned with a buttery flavour. The hash browns (not the typical style) stood on their own not needing any added condiments, fresh ground white or black pepper would've elevated the potatoes a notch. The plate also came with a good portion of fresh cut watermelon and grapefruit. $11.xx tax included is a very reasonable price.  I was not feeling hungry so ordered toast with coffee, coffee that had appeared as we sat down. I was surprised to be presented with a full plate. Two thick slices of brown toast well buttered (as ordered) a mountain of creamy hashed potatoes (as above), two decent sized pieces of fresh cut fruit, again watermelon and grapefruit, must of been on sale, lol. It was a meal and far more than I'd intended on eating. But as the scintillating conversation continued, my arms moved in an automaton fashion keeping me very happy during my attentive listening phases. Jams for the toast were a nice (not gourmet by any stretch) selection of orange marmalade, blueberry of which I partook it was good, strawberry, and peanut butter to round out the choices. All this for a whopping $4.54 tax included.  A little more attention to detail in the cooking would up the ante a bit. I am not a fan of the loud cafeteria style ambiance, I get the easy clean motif but really, I'd fire the designer. Sound dampening materials are not that expensive while under construction and cost effective methods are easily implemented afterwards. I cannot bring myself at this stage to garner more than three stars overall. But we will be coming back and my friend will be bringing his wife there for her birthday this next weekend. In the West Island, their biggest completion is Chez Cora on Hymus at what will become known as the Target mall (not a real mall of course) in Pointe Claire. Another nice touch was the waitress asking if we wanted the fruit included. I really appreciate the waste not want not attitude. The wastes that copiously pours out of restaurants like this could literally feed all those who are not so fortunate to (over indulge) eat as well as we do. All the school breakfast programs would want for nothing. Ok sorry for the preaching, lol, but I am right."}
{"text":"Am I the only one that thinks their potatoes aren't that good?? I go to brunch just for the home fries and to be served this mushy mess instead feels so wrong. Just wrong. This place is also annoying as hell to get to coming from the highways."}
{"text":"Not real food, benedict sauce still taste powder, cafe is cheap, fruits dryed up. Expensive."}
{"text":"Allo Mon Coco is a chain so you'll get the typical chain-isms such as you'll have to pay extra for tomatoes instead of fruit or green tea instead of coffee. But considering most people aren't as picky as I, and considering its a chain, this place is good. The bacon and ham were perfectly cooked, the potatoes are fantastic, the toast and the beans were very very average, if not slightly below. The eggs were eggs. In general, it's a basic breakfast place with nice servers but nothing special."}
{"text":"Food: TONS of options, TONS! Even the most picky person will find something enjoyable here, salty, sweet, light, heavy-duty meat overload, anything can be found here, and the portions are humongous! Enough to feed 3 people! However the side fruits are always the same pretty much and even when ordering fruit abundant options, the variety is limited, you would expect a more diversified mixture for the price you are paying... Otherwise typical American-style breakfast with carb overload, eat 'til you drop~  Service: Slow, and need to make many attempts in order for the waiter to notice you, likely due to how busy it is~ AKA do not expect fast coffee refill~ but it's so great to have hot plates!  Value: Fantastic price-food ratio!   Ambiance: BUSY, BUSY, BUSY (=noisy) and always have to line-up in AM. High ceiling to make the space more open but the tables are so tight together in some areas, feels like your elbows will end up in someone else's plate..."}
{"text":"J'adore les patates au fromage!!! Les déjeuners sont délicieux, les assiettes sont généreuses et l'ambiance est génial! Seul point négatif: la longue fille d'attente à tous moment de la journée."}
{"text":"My cousin told me about this place, decided to try it today.  I loved it, the portions were big, and the price depending on the dish is somewhat reasonable.   Bottom line will be back again."}
{"text":"No AC. Some items on the menu are really good, others are disgustingly sweet. Hit or miss."}
{"text":"I have been there three times and was never disappointed. The omelets are just unbelievable. The portions are generous for low prices. The seats are very comfortable but the lineup is too long, but the waiting is worth it."}
{"text":"Service de merde pour un samedi matin les serveuse trop occuper à se raconter leur soirée réussi à avoir un verre d eau après 7 min.. Très déçu pour un premier essaie..!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place   Amazing choices, fast service and friendly staff Generous with their portions   A MUST try breakfast place in Laval"}
{"text":"USED to be my go-to breakfast joint.  Nothing to do with the food but everything to do with customer service. Told they take reservations but NOT between 10am and 2pm.  Ok - I get it.  Went at 10:30 to get a table for 8 people by 11am.  While in line waiting another group comes in with a reservation!!!!  Told they accepted that reservation LAST week.  Still confused by their completely illogical explanation of their non-existent reservation policy.  I \"think\" you can make a reservation between 10 and 2 ONLY if it's a week in advance?!??!  Either way they won't be seeing my business again."}
{"text":"Toujours parfait ! La deco ressemble a une usine mais les assietes vont ravir les gros mangeurs !"}
{"text":"A1 The service is Excellente and the price is Good they are A worm place to be and lovly people...10/10 keep the Good job...Go and try it u we come back and back to it."}
{"text":"I like this breakfast place a lot! Fast and good service and the menu is big - there is something for anyone and it's hard to decice while you see the food of other people!"}
{"text":"Efficient seating process,  fast service, friendly staff. The food was very good and although in the mid range in price they give you so much. You get your money's worth. Overall I enjoyed my first time here and will be back."}
{"text":"Aucune comparaison! Allo mon coco est LE meilleur resto déjeuner. Il faut essayer le choco coco, les assiettes sont généreuses! Un peu bruyant mais bon. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast spot in Laval (and most of Montreal, for that matter).  The food and quality of the ingredients have been consistently good over the (many) years I've been coming here. On the weekends, you'll definitely want to be there before 10 or 10:30, or there will be an out-the-door lineup. The staff is friendly and efficient, and your coffee cup will rarely be empty.    There's a wide variety of items on the menu, from the classic eggs and bacon (around $6) to the \"good morning\" (a cinnamon brioche with an egg on one side and a mountain of fruit and english cream on the other, served with bacon, home potatoes and toast, around $11) and \"the American\" (you guessed it, steak and eggs). The crepes (around $9-12) are thin and delicious, and have fillings including apple and cheddar, fruit and English cream and a meat filled omelette.    The portions are pretty generous  - head on over if you're hungry."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago when Allo Mon Coco opened I posted a review praising the food and service. The food remains unchanged. It's well prepared standard breakfast fare.   The service on the other hand is, frankly, abysmal. Today for the first time in my life I got up and walked out of a restaurant leaving the meal barely touched. That was after waiting for someone to take my order (i eventually had to track down the hostess, who eventually sent a waitress who said she was \"just informed\" there was a customer at the booth. Another ridiculous wait for the food - again only coming once I complained to a staff member (the one waitress in the place that seems to genuinely care) to be followed by another wait for toast while everything else went cold. After almost 40 minutes I lost patience and walked out.  I could blame the hostess and the waitress, both of whom could be kindly described as indifferent and probably more accurately categorized as both lazy and indifferent. They don't deserve blame though. They were only doing what comes naturally to staff when the management stops managing.  I'll give the owner(s) some unsolicited advice.  One:  Try spending some time in your store. The staff (especially the young ones) wander around aimlessly with no desire or understanding of what is expected. When a waitress tells me she needed someone to notify her she had a customer  I really wonder if she ever bothers to look at her station. That's so bush you should be ashamed of how little you put into training and follow-up. Two Put someone on hostess duties who is actually going to greet customers within a couple of minutes and knows the extent of her (his) job. Currently you've got a parade of amateurs  - usually waiters or waitresses who have their own jobs to do. Alternately ask the person who seats customers to inform them that they are now being abandoned. At least prepare the customer for the rest of the non-service coming their way. Three If you really don't care about your restaurant - sell it. The food is good. There are some staff members who really do care about doing a good job. Before you kill a good thing at least profit from it. Four If you actually do care about your store. Get your ass off the couch and get back to work. Clean house. Light a fire under the lazy ones and if they still don't rise to the job boot them out. Inspire the good ones to meet your standards (you'll need to show everyone that you actually have those standards - something not currently evident) Five Let me know when you get your act back together. I'll come again. Until then, Laval isn't far away."}
{"text":"Petit déjeuner très sympathique, la nourriture est bonne, la quantité est au rendez-vous, les serveuses sont bien présentes malgré tout le monde qu'elle doivent gérer. Et le prix est bon pour la qualité et la quantité!! Très bonne place, j'y retournerais!!"}
{"text":"Allo mon coco is great!   My favourite breakfast restaurant used to be Cora's because they have the april 89, which is a whole lot of fruit wrapped in a crepe. Here, they have the same thing, but the fruit they use is always very fresh, as if it was always in season. Cora's fruit can be pretty gross in the winter.  Is it busy, yes. Especially Sunday around noon. That just proves that everyone loves it! It's definitely not for a lack of quick service. However, I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a lounging brunch spot.   They are very consistent with their food quality, it's always awesome :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to breakfast spots. I have yet to go and not see it packed. It's usually filled with hot chicks and I'm not talking about eggs lol.  The food is great, service is fast, the ambiance is nice. I don't know what else you'd want."}
{"text":"Parmi les meilleures places pour prendre le petit-déjeuner à Laval. Belles assiettes avec beaucoup de fruits frais. Par contre, l'endroit est très bruyant."}
{"text":"Best breakfast on the West Island! Cute and clean environment. Nice staff and huge portions. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to try out this breakfast chain.  Just when I thought I had seen it all, I try their potatoes and wow! Hard to describe, sort of like s cross between a more traditional breakfast potato and mashed potatoes, somehow it works! The rest of the breakfast is pretty standard, in a good and reliable sort of way.  Be warned, unless you go at the crack of dawn, you will wait (like anywhere else serving breakfast on a weekend). The entryway is well designed to take this  into account, with quite a bit of room to hang out. The staff did a pretty good job while we were there keeping track of people waiting and fighting out seating arrangements."}
{"text":"Ne laissez pas la file qui est généralement présente la fin de semaine vous faire peur, le roulement est rapide et vous serez assis en un rien de temps. L'endroit est propre et bien décoré. Le service est rapide, mais si vous avez besoin de quelque chose,(verre d'eau, sirop, ketchup) n'attendez pas après votre serveur (vous pourriez attendre longtemps), demandez plutôt à un employé qui passe près de vous.  Bon, maintenant la bouffe. Tout est vraiment excellent là-bas. J'ai un faible pour les omelettes et les ufs bénédictines. Mention au bol de fruits qui accompagne certains repas... généreux et vraiment bon. Les patates font aussi la réputation de se resto, elle sont succulentes. Pour les plus petits appétits, prende une grande assiette et la séparer puisque les portions sont assez généreuse. Quoique pas très original dans leur menu, les classiques y sont, ils sont bons et vous seront servis rapidement."}
{"text":"Generous portions with a wide variety of different styles of eggs benny to choose from. This is definitely a more traditional breakfast place offer classic combos like eggs and pancakes or french toast. Be prepared to wait in line for a while as there's yet to be a time where I've gone without a crazy line up. If you are gonna spoil yourself try the crab cake eggs benny !"}
{"text":"It is a nice place to get a quick bite. The service is good and very pleasant and helpful. The food is nice too, but not to die for   You can go there with your kids and enjoy a nice morning breakfast! We usually go there when we want to go shopping too, since it has an entrance from the Place Vertu mall then it is very convenient for us.   Friendly staff, good food and nice ambiance! If you are in the area you could try it!"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, when I first came to allo mon coco..I was taken a back by the quality food and service ..I now live in Toronto and came here because I was craving a nice breakfast! Almost $30 for rubbery pancakes & salty potatoes! My waitress looked depressed & hungover..she was extremely sneaky..I asked for an orange juice ..and she brought me a large size without asking if I wanted a regular sized one! When it was time to pay, instead of the percentage option on the debit machine..she went straight to the $ option so I would tip more without noticing. She was crap, and the food was really crap. How do you mess up breakfast and charge $30 for 1 person? Never coming back. Petinos near by is a better bang for your buck, waiters more friendly and the food is much tastier !"}
{"text":"Every now and then I love going to Allo mon coco for breakfast. The line ups can be long and depending on the location the service can be hit or miss. Their selection though will surely please you. I went after a while and was surprised to see that they've added even more options to their menu (coco casseroles)! I tried the veggie coco casserole. Really good, quite a big portion size. All that said, I must say the prices have been crawling up year after year. It's ridiculous paying $20 plus tip and taxes for a breakfast with coffee. At the beginning coffee used to be included for a lot of the menu items but they've taken that away too!"}
{"text":"c.est ma meilleure place pour dejeuner , le service est bon sauf une chose que j aime pas chez eux c est la fille qu on fait avant de rentrer , je pense qu ils peuvent avoir un local plus grand pour satisfaire leur clientele"}
{"text":"Bad service! I went there yesterday for my friend's birthday and the waitress had no respect! I told her that my OJ didn't taste like Tropicana and she really took it personal... I noticed she was mad but I didn't pay attention until she came back to ask my friends if they wanted a coffee refill and didn't ask me lol... She ignored us then and at the end she sent another waitress with a Tropicana juice to show me it really was Tropicana  like what did you do that for ? Is not the first time waitresses there act this way, attitude problem I guess!"}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday morning, the brunch was delicious and staff were friendly. They were very busy, but never forget to keep their smiles on. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Allo mon coco est mon resto déjeuné préféré!   Je prenais souvent l'assiette deux oeufs avec un choix d'ingrédient ou plusieurs pour vraiment ce retrouver avec un plat sur mesure.   Je suis devenue vegan il y a 6 mois, et c'est les seul qui prennent le temps de me faire une crêpe sarrasin sans oeuf et sans lait! Avec des fruits et de la mélasse ou du sirop d'érable c'est un délice!"}
{"text":"La service etait ok mais le manager a profiter des allergies de nos enfants pour charger des extra. De plus ils n'onr pas d'option (autre que fruit et toast) pour ceux qui ont des allergies aux produits laitiers. Endroit: Montreal - Lacordaire.  Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Go here when the Ste-Dorothée location is too packed"}
{"text":"Super bien déjeuné. Prix corrects. Belle ambiance familiale. C'est vrai que les pommes de terre au fromage sont succulentes."}
{"text":"This place is located in a strip mall type complex near the south west intersection of Sources and Brunswick across from Towne Hall.  This restaurant this time of year had some really nice decorations.  I'm not sure if the birch branches are always there on the outside but inside they had both Christmas and Hanukkah but even without the decor the interior has a really nice open space with very high ceilings.  There are plenty of booths here some large so you have a bit of privacy and coziness feel to it even though it's very bright inside.  The menu is in both French and English if you flip it over and each section is separated into breakfast, kid's menu and lunch.  The menu is very large which a variety of combinations with eggs, meat, pancakes, bagels, crepes, fruit etc.  It sort of reminds me of a Cora's (Chez Cora in QC) but nicer.  I ordered the Gourmand/Guzzler (French and English names on the menu) which is the first item on the menu for breakfast.  Included are 2 eggs cooked to order, bacon, ham, sausage, potatoes, toast and 2 pancakes and coffee was included for 13.25.  I added cheese to the potatoes for 3 dollars as well.   The breakfast is huge.  It's a very large meal for the first meal of the day and considering how much food it is, it's enough to skip lunch, for me at least.  Our servers worked as a team and were constantly checking in if we needed refills on water or coffee.  The service here is really good and so is the food.  The value is also pretty good considering the size of servings which are generous.  Given the choice between Allo Mon Coco and Cora's I'd definitely choose AMC."}
{"text":"Un incontournable pour les brunchs! Les serveuses ont été toujours très nice (et normalement je reste avec mon amie environ 3h en train de discuter!). C'est grand et normalement il ne faut pas attendre (ou l'attente est courte). On commande toujours le \"gourmand\" et le \"good morning\", et ils sont excellents! Café illimité. Les frites sont très bonnes! Ça coute environ 15$ par personne."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with friends and had a great time with items we ordered. Service, food & pricing are excellent. I would highly recommend this place and go there again."}
{"text":"Be sure to arrive before 10am if you don't want to wait in line for a table - even if you're just 2 people.    This would have to be my 11th visit to a Allo Mon Coco, but, this is my 10th visit to this West Island location.  I enjoy the food here; I always try a different plate each time that I visit.    What is consistent here at the West Island location is the poor customer service.  I have come here with my bf, or with a party of 3, 4 and even 8 (with 2 children), and we've been seated at various tables.   The majority of the waiters/waitresses and hostess really don't give a hoot about the clients.  No welcoming reception, no interest in taking orders.... the majority of the staff are young and appear to be disengaged.  (I've witnessed staff gossiping/saying unpleasant things at the entrance about clients in front of other clients!  One time, I waited at the very front of the line for a table, next to the hostess, for 1 hour waiting on a table for 3... clients who have arrived after me were being seated before me, and when I asked the hostess how long would it be for the next table of 3 to be available, I looked down at her paper with the list of names and number in a party, and I saw that my name was scratched out - her response to that was that she had called my name but no one responded to it and so she gave my table away.  I said that's impossible because I was at the front of the line the whole time... next to her!)  Anyway, back to this visit - I ordered the bacon and tomato omelet.  It was good.  It is served with toast, a small watermelon and grapefruit slice, and potatoes.  With a lack of  other words to describe the potatoes, I'd say they are mash potato-ish.  Very good. You may ask for the potatoes to be well-done - which means less \"mash potato-like\" and more of a fried/crispy texture.  For an extra cost, you may have cheese on top of the potatoes.  The plate is a generous serving, so come hungry!  The coffee is very good too.  The only other location I've been to is at Dix 30 - a whole different other demographic over there...and a small/tight place...no elbow room, but the food was good there.  [There are 2 good waiter/waitress who works there - I do pray that you get seated in their section.  They are the 2 more older of the wait staff.  I really would have given at least another star to this place, but as a whole, the customer service was just not good enough.]"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast for your money in the west island. The portions are huge, but you have a great selection. The staff is fast and couteous in what is essentially a mad house of activity. If it's Saturday or Sunday morning and you're hungry, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was a great place for breakfast, we're for sure coming back. One thing for me that it was long time waiting to sit down. And make sure that you get all the little extras like cream for the coffee, the toasts and the glass of water. Since they were busy it understandable but shouldn't be up to me to remind them every time that I need something."}
{"text":"Je qualifierais mon expérience générale de bonne. Si j'y retourne, ce sera en grande partie grâce au service impeccable auquel j'ai eu droit. Très peu d'attente et très beau travail d'équipe!   J'avais choisi l'assiette santé composée de 2 ufs pochés, bagel, yogourt et fruits frais. Le bagel, je m'en serais passé finalement... J'avais oublié le goût fade des bagels de supermarché, c'est-à-dire à des années-lumière des bagels St-Viateur! Je l'ai donc laissé de côté, mais heureusement on nous sert des portions d'ogre, j'ai donc tout de même pu manger à ma faim et même plus!  Justement, j'ai été agréablement surprise par l'abondance de fruits qui accompagnait mon plat. Trop souvent, dans les restaurants à déjeuner, lorsqu'on lit sur le menu \"servi avec fruits\", on doit s'attendre à quelque chose comme 2 tranches de melon et quelques morceaux de fruits quelconques parfois même pas trop mûrs, ce qui n'est pas du tout le cas ici! On voit qu'ils portent une attention particulière aux choix de fruits, car ils étaient tous très savoureux. Et pour finir, le café. Un gros boff malheureusement. Il m'a paru trop dilué... manque de goût."}
{"text":"4 words: crab cake eggs benedict. Soooooo good. It also comes with their famous potatoes and a bowl of fresh fruit. Be warned that the lineup can get pretty bad on weekends, but I think that's common with most brunch places. Totally worth the lineup!"}
{"text":"When a friend asked me to meet up with him and some other friends for Sunday Brunch, I'm like yeah man, where? The rotation to this point included L'Avenue, Dim Sum @ Kam Fung or some small diner in the Plateau or NDG, all them waiting for at least a 45 minute wait, plus the time it takes to wait for stragglers. So I went to Yelp to check it out and first see the reviews, then the menu pics + prices. First thought was: Hold up!  This place is in Laval?! No way I'm heading out there, I don't care who's got a Communauto membership, it's just too far, I know people travel great and wide, and there is a lot of seating but can't do it mate. Then my friend texted me the address for the new one in Cote Des Neiges, near the Jewish General, I was in!  The line up was about 15-20 minutes and it was packed with 20somethings, you know this is foodie paradise. On to the food, I had the Eggs Benedict Classic, I call it the litmus test for all breakie joints, it was about $12 but it was worth it, heaping hash browns, for $2 I had extra cheese on top and a huge fruit and berry bowl. I started in on it, and couldn't stop...the one caveat was that it wasn't exactly hot and when Hollandaise is warm it changes it's taste and flavour. Can't win em all and since it was new I let it pass, for now. Good eats, bright place, and lots of space, check out the new Allo Mon Coco!"}
{"text":"La largesse des assiettes en note de tête et l'avenants de celles-ci en note de cur. J'insiste sur leur port bien posé propre à convaincre, un resto-déjeuner solide. 'Le Gourmand' se décompose en un déjeuner de champion. Portion qui donne largement pour un repas si matinal. Les longes de cochonnet sont un peu sèches et tièdes d'assaisonnements. Les patates maisons sont différentes des présentations connues. Elles sont à mi-chemin entre de la purée et des frites. Faut-il de la sauce brune ou du ketchup? Ce franchisé est loin de mon quartier sinon nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"Right in the arms of what is familiar. Same decor, same food, same decorum.The review I gave to the one in CDN, this location gets the same!"}
{"text":"This place looks good and pretty at first look but when you get seated you start noticing the bench is wet and dirty with crumbs, the floor is littered with fruit jelly cups, the banquette is stained, the white windows seperating the booths are filthy with finger prints and even the white walls have food splattered all over them... First thing I'm thinking is that if this is how their restaurant is, then how dirty is their kitchen? Next up is their Dollarama \"quality\" cutlery. It's all mix matched and feels like crap in your hands. They have a foot long pepper mill, but in the last year that I've been coming here it's ALWAYS been EMPTY. This time around the waitress brought it to our table and I had to clue her into the fact it was empty. Isn't it your JOB as a server to check things out before you bring them to a table? Yes it is.  Our food was bland and unseasoned. We both had the Copenhague eggs benedict, the smoked salmon tasted chewy, not fresh, the hollandaise sauce was very bland, the mashed potatoes were tasteless slop.  All in all not a pleasent experience.  Petino's close to the 13 is better than this. I think yhey should focus on the quality of their food and LEARN HOW TO CLEAN UP.  I've given this place many tries but have been annoyed by too many things to ever come back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! HOWEVER I tried the one in st leonard and by far the worst service. Food came fast except I got my food before my boyfriend, waited about 10 minutes thinking his food was coming... turns out they forgot his order.  Waitress finally came over and asked if I wanted my eggs changed if they were cold. After the fact she was accommodating but because of  the poor service I definately wont go back. I will definately drive a further distance to the one on marche centrale or in laval."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, fast friendly service. Cozy environment lots of variety in plates."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Allo Mon Coco yet! I have been there a million times and have never left disappointed.  The food not only tastes amazing but is presented so nice as well.  This is one time I don't mind waiting in a long line to eat. The time in the line passes pretty quickly and the amazing meal more than makes up for it.  If you are looking for a breakfast joint in Montreal, Laval, or the West Island you have to get your butt down to Allo Mon Coco where you always get service with a smile, a full plate of food, and it doesn't exactly break the bank either!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious and the service was fast.  Will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary other than the potato hash thing that comes with most of the plates. If the dishes were put together with a little more precision and congruence then this place would have been a winner (for a chain). It's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"An okay brunch place. It has all the usual brunch dishes but isn't very extraordinary."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to allo mon coco, it is always packed with full of people. Great location, love the place. It's spacious. Staff are nice and courteous. Everytime people ask me where should we go for brunch, this place immediately comes to my mind :P but really, they serve big portions every time i go there and i always enjoy my time over there!"}
{"text":"I'll start this review by one word: YUMMY!  Went there on a Sunday afternoon for brunch around 1:30PM, and we were 8.  Let's play with the pros and cons right away.  Pros: - Food is exceptionally good - Friendly service (our waiter was super duper cool, fast, and very nice), came to ask us if everything was fine, cracked some jokes, and was efficient at giving the food to our table at the same time - Unlimited coffee as usual for most places like this, but what was better is that the waiters/bus boys come often to fill up your coffee!  Cons: - Huge wait time. Allo Mon Coco is very known and is popular. Plus, in the heart of Laval in Centropolis, there is a parking lot, thus people come to take advantage of it, causing an increase of clientele. - A little bit pricey than other brunch/breakfast places, but it's nothing to feel upset about!  Definitely would love to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was ridiculously good! I tried two different locations while in Montreal and both times the food didn't disappoint. The only thing I didn't like was the smoked meat but his ain't the place for smoked meat so that was my bad. Especially loved the fruit!"}
{"text":"Little brother to the original Coco. But not quite the same vibe. The place is fair, but not memorable enough to go out of your way."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite breakfast restaurant in Laval. Long lines are very common, but it moves along at a fairly quick pace. In an ever increasing world of lousy breakfast restaurants, coco is head & shoulders above the rest."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give them 5 stars. After today's visit I'd have to say 3.5 stars but I'll give them 4 because the food is actually good.   The first time I visited Allo Mon Coco Jan 1st 2015 everything was great. Our waitress was amazing and our food was cooked to perfection. The small blueberry pancake that came on the side of my breakfast was amazing! I think it was called Lac something Jean. As I sit here for my second visit today- Jan 2nd 2015 I can say that the same hostess from yesterday is more unpleasant today than yesterday and our new waitress today is no where near as good as our waitress yesterday. Actually I'd say the service today was below average. However the food is consistent and very good .   The one thing we really disliked today was the attitude of the service and the fact that we were asked if we're were done our food whilst putting my pancake in my mouth lol. Anyway food was great but we didn't enjoy the service today it was just very unpleasant I can't say who was worst today our hostess or server."}
{"text":"Decent and convenient breakfast place. Located right at the corner of my work, I had to try it out someday. As someone who usually rather not go to chain restaurants, my hunger talked this time and let me to the closest place I could find.   We were seated fairly quickly for lunchtime on a weekday. The service also was fairly quick and good. As for the food, it is pretty much what you would find for a breakfast chain restaurant. That includes slightly overpriced meals for what it is, and the same choices of eggs and sweets (waffles, crepes, etc). I personally went for the chicken with waffle. I have to admit I was disappointed by the chicken itself which was slightly dry. The fruits included in the plate were also very scant. As for the eggs, no complains, but that's how it should be when you pay 15$+ for some eggs!"}
{"text":"There are several locations today of this trending breakfast chain, much prefer the Fabreville location rather than the other locations.  Pros :  - Many delicious breakfast options to choose from. My favorite plate by far is the Choco Coco but feel free to try out their many many delicious options.  - Plates are HUUUUUGE.  - The potatoes are fantastic, especially with the 50/50 cheese on it. A great way to start a day with this brunch.  Cons :  - Always packed during the weekends from 9 AM to 12 PM and this location is THE WORST OF THEM ALL when it comes to lines!  - Terrible seating arrangements on EVERY VISIT! Nothing is more frustrating than waiting for half an hour while you look at a several couples having breakfast in a huge 4 seat bunkers and having to wait even longer when you're in a bigger group due to poor seating arrangements.  - Service is very hectic and the quality of it differs wildly from one server to the next. Sometimes you get a fantastic waiter who sees you right away, brings your coffee promptly, refills regularly, bothers to chat with you and provide you some level of entertainment, makes sure you're happy, then more times than not, you get.... nothing. Wait 30-40 minutes to get in, get seats, only get your coffee 10-15 minutes after seating... trying to get their attention to order? Unacceptable.  Overall, I recommend Allo Mon Coco, it's a great place to eat. However, service in this location leaves to be desired. Perhaps they require more staff to deal with the popularity in this location or better business practices on how to get things done better..."}
{"text":"Meilleure succursale Allo Mon Coco. Portions généreuses, service rapide et courtois, très groupes-friendly (c'est grand!).  La file est souvent très longue, alors armez-vous de patience et apportez vos mandalas. Si vous y allez à plusieurs, assurez-vous d'arriver en même temps: impossible d'attendre quelqu'un à sa table. Le groupe doit être complet pour s'installer. Cela dit, un coup assis, tout se passe très vite!   Seul hic (majeur): les prix qui augmentent à une vitesse exponentielle. Ça, ça brise mon coeur de pauvre. J'y retournerai quand même, parce que c'est si bon!"}
{"text":"Bon, ça va mieux qu'au Marché Central, mais la succursale de Laval est imbattable, toujours ;)  Longue attente à l'entrée même si plusieurs tables semblent prêtes. Réservations? Peut-être. Un coup assises, on a froid.  Faudrait revoir le système de portes!   Sinon, bon service, bouffe excellente, les fruits sont frais, les oeufs bénédictine avec bacon et patates sont bien chauds. Tout le monde sort satisfait, le ventre plein et le portefeuille encore en bon état!"}
{"text":"Endroit sympathique pour bruncher sur Côte des neiges. Le menu du midi n'est pas spécialement délicieux et surtout à oublier après 15h car au final il n'y a plus de soupe ni dessert."}
{"text":"Ma première visite à ce restaurant spécialisé pour les déjeuners. Comme mentionné pas d'autres sur Yelp, il est préférable le week end d'arriver avant 10:00. Puisque nous sommes arrivés à 11:00 il y avait une file à la porte mais l'attente n'a pas été plus que 15 minutes. Bel accueil à la porte par une jeune femme qui contrôle la file. Mon amie a commandé le duo crêpe et gaufre aux fruits. Elle a bien aimé. A sa demande la crème pâtissière a été servie à part. De mon côté, j'ai pris les ufs bénédictine aux champignons et brie. La combinaison des deux manquait un peu de goût mais l'abondance des fruits frais et le bon goût des pommes de terre ont compensé. Le service était parfait. Ce que je trouve dans ce genre de restaurant est le manque de goût du cafe. Le stationnement est très facile. Il y a une belle terrasse sur le trottoir."}
{"text":"The bowl of fresh fruit is enough reason to visit this place but their eggs Benedict are outstanding! Had the bacon Benedict and it was perfectly done. An order is big enough for two since the fruit bowl is like a breakfast in itself. Had breakfast their twice in a week and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best potatoes I've ever had.  Portions are huge!!! Prices are a bit steep but you get more than enough. Today was the second time I was there.  My eggs were served cold but the waitress addressed and fixed that immediately. Its a very busy place, but we barely waited.  Service was prompt and friendly. It did take a bit too long to get my coffee refilled and to get my water, but I'll be back that's for sure"}
{"text":"Very attractive interior, but mediocre food and service at a fairly high price. I came in for a late breakfast, was seated right away and offered coffee. My order was taken promptly. But my meal was disappointing: overdone, dry scrambled eggs that seem to have been cooked hard, then chopped up. Home fries were a gray, unappetizing mass, as if they'd been left on a steam table for hours. My waitress was cheerful and responsive when I could catch her eye, but this was a challenge. I waited and waited for a chance to flag her down for a coffee refill, a problem you don't often find in a breakfast place. Prices were rather high, about $13 for most breakfast offerings. Just not worth it, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Decided to pop into this breakfast joint on my last day in Montreal. It was very busy and luckily we scored a booth upon entering! The servers were super friendly and attentive. I ordered the Allo Mon Coco special w/ a side of fruits (opt for the side instead of the individual order), and my boyfriend got the Guzzler. Food was hot and delicious & the portion sizes are huge! Definitely bang for buck, I highly recommend eating here if you're looking for a different style breakfast/brunch option instead of Cora's!  Only downside is you'll have to pay to park on the street or find a spot somewhere within the residential areas and walk a bit."}
{"text":"For a chain brunch restaurant the food is fairly good and consistent. The waffles are light and fluffy with a heaping mound of fruit. The eggs Benedict were actually perfectly cooked the two times I've had them, which is saying something as many places have difficulty not over-cooking them. One negative is I've received chipped plates and coffee mugs a couple of times."}
{"text":"Copy conforme de sa succursale sur Dagenais mais la décoration est plus moderne."}
{"text":"L'un des plus vaste menu de déjeuner en ville. Les pommes de terre couverte d'une généreuse portion de fromage pour quelques dollars est délicieuse mais beaucoup trop salée, pourtant j'adore le sel. Bien que je n'y ai pas goûté, ils ont un beau menu pour le lunch de semaine qui passe de la salade à l'hamburger."}
{"text":"Allo mon coco has now franchised itself and I couldn't be happier for this joint. The quality of their service and food has remained consistent to their original location and they absolutely deserve the hype they get.   If you've read my other reviews, you'll know that I tend to order the same breakfast everywhere. Two eggs, sausage, potatoes, and fruit. According to my standards, allo mon coco does a pretty good job! Sausage is always crispy on the outside. Potatoes are unique and flavourful. Coffee is always flowing. The only downside is that there is no variety of fruit on the plate. It's typically a melon slice or grapefruit slice. This is something their newer competitor, Kitchen 73, has picked up on and is actually surpassing AMC on.   Other that that, this place is fantastic and is a solid choice for Sunday morning breakfast. Arrive early though, because the lines can get long."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at 10 AM and the place was hellacioucly busy! I mean busy as the line snaked out the door on a cold Saturday in December. It's a big restaurant but one thing the restaurant failed at paying attention was that it's one big hall so when it's packed it's a loud place.   Onto the food the breakfasts are humongous. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and it came with a huge serving of fruit (awesome) and an equally huge serving of potatoes. I can eat a lot of food but I left a good amount of potatoes to be thrown away as I could not possibly eat that much food. I'm not trying to be a sour puss but they must throw out a lot of food here as the plates are beyond what one person could eat. That kind of food wastage isn't my cup of tea but if you want a monster big breakfast serving come here. The salmon eggs Benedict was a solid 4/5. My wife ordered an omelette to share with my daughter and another person eating with us ordered an omelette as well. All big servings and everyone had a full tummy as we left.   Overall the experience is a bit meh as for breakfast I prefer a more chill place than Grand Central station. That's just me however. The food was very good just that other parts of the experience could be better. If the restaurant management is reading this please, (I know it's probably all about volume) the coffee you serve is barely palatable. Sure many people may feel fine but a true breakfast restaurant understands the importance of high quality coffee. McDonald's understands this and that's the reason it's a lmeetup/hangout place for old people now. All you need to do is have a high quality house coffee. Don't even serve capucinno or espresso. Charge a $2 premium for a higher quality one. I'll pay it."}
{"text":"I just went here yesterday for brunch and I'm so happy I discovered the place! I had heard about it before but never been. The portions are huge, so it's a very good choice for brunch, especially if you are hungover, this place will cure you! I got the two eggs with bacon and potatoes and pancake, which was still pretty big, but compared to their other things in the menu, mine was relatively small. The prices are fine for what you get and the coffee is included with the breakfast as well.   The only thing is you have to get their in a good time, or else there will be a line-up cause its pretty busy. Also, I heard that this Allo Mon Coco in Cotes de Neiges is better then their other branch. But would definitely recommend this place, at least I'm going back there for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. There was a line outside the door just to get in here. I got 3 eggs scrambled with toast on brown bread, French toast, 2 sausages, mashed potatoes, fruits, a buttermilk pancake as the side and a hot chocolate with whipped cream to drink. I added a bit of black pepper to the eggs but other than that everything tasted real good! The mashed potatoes had such a good flavor. Another stand out was the hot chocolate. The whipped cream was the best I ever had and made the hot chocolate better.I was super full after eating all of that. Other than the food, the service here is really good. The place is always busy but the service is still near perfect. I recommend that everyone tries this place for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more but in the end it was just average. We were seated quickly, like most Montreal brunch places. The service was very good, and our waitress was friendly despite our being a little demanding as customers.   The eggs were DELICIOUS and tasted organic. My potatoes were cold, though very tasty, and I didn't want to eat them anyway for caloric intake reasons. They give you a very large generous portion of garlic breakfast mash.  Bacon was very undercooked and had to be sent back.   As noted, our server was very pleasant and good."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch.  It can be quite busy so make sure to book reservations!  The chocolate banana crepe was mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices and friendly staff. Although the restaurant is quite big and seats a lot of people, there's always a lineup after 10 am, so make sure you get there early unless you want to starve.   The food used to be better when the restaurant first opened in the west island, but it's still good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place, fast service, hot plates. Taste is amazing. One of the best side potatoes you can have. The staff is bilingual and knowledgable. The ambiance is a bit loud but its a family place so its to be expected. Prices are reasonable. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place and I'm not a huge fan. They put cheese on their potatoes.. you can ask any place to add cheese on your potatoes. I had a 3 cheese omelette and was super disappointed. It was tasteless."}
{"text":"Go there on a Sat. or Sun. morning and yes, you will wait, but the line does move quick. You'll be seated by the time you finish checking emails and messages you missed the night before on your smart phone because the music was either too loud or the vodka was flowing nicely wherever it was you were partying.  Once served, this breakfast will hit the spot and that rubbery feeling brought on by a lack of sleep will subside.  Depending on what you order, you will either be ready to take advantage of the day or just find a nice couch for an afternoon kip.  Take your pick on either but Mon Coco does breakfast right.  Good portions, great combinations, quick service and fair prices.  This is the model of what every breakfast place should be.  Chez Cora, Tuti Fruiti et al, take notes.... you've slacked long enough and the name Cora can only take you so far for so long.  Pancakes are meant to be soft and break apart with a fork, do you hear me Cora.... I shouldn't have to use a steak knife to cut them.  Fruit should be fresh and in season... offering berry coulies and english cream on everything is not my idea of fresh and seasonal!  Filling my plate with a mountain of smashed potatoes does not interest me either, a small tasty portion is sufficient, leave me some room for the heart of my order.  You listening Cosmopolitan!  Using large eggs is expected if my hankering is a standard bacon and eggs dish.  The use of pee wee/small eggs is not going to score you big points, did you get that Ben & Florentine!  All in all, for the scrap out there who do nothing but breakfast, this is one line worth waiting for to avoid disappointment.  My only other recommendation is to wait at Beauty's, but you'll be sipping your coffee and dipping your toast much sooner at Mon Coco.  You'll also save a few loonies over Beauty's but miss out on the charm."}
{"text":"Very good variety of breakfast / brunch type of food. Good portions, freshly prepared, plenty of healthy options too. I like the open concept if the restaurant, it feel less crowded. Prices are average however beware of extras , an additional portion of tomato could end up costing you 3$ , better choose from their combinations. Good for groups but could end up waiting an hour to be seated (sometimes stuff are not so brilliant in planing seats). They have extra menu for weekdays lunches but could nit comment on it as i did not tried it. All in all good food, good ambiance. Recommend it especially for egg and fruit lovers. 4 stars for the food quality an service. 3 stars for the seating / reception."}
{"text":"Resto à déjeuner correcte, sans plus. Les portions sont immenses. Trop même. On frôle le gaspillage de nourriture ici. Je suis venu en groupe. Une seule personne à notre table a réussi à terminer son assiette. C'est tout dire.   La spécialité de la place, les patates à déjeuner gratinées, ne m'impression pas. À vrai dire, je trouve même que c'est un étalage de sodium et de cholestérol qui bouche l'estomac. Ma copine à eu des difficultés à diriger les siennes.   Le point fort : la diversité du menu. On offre de tout pour le déjeuner ici : crêpes, bénédictines, gaufres, déjeuners classiques, déjeuners santés. Le service est efficace. La bouffe est bonne, mais sans être exceptionnel. Pour ma part, j'ai choisi la crêpe banane et Nutella. Mon assiette était correcte.   Les fins de semaine, attendez-vous à faire la file une trentaine de minute pour avoir une table. Alors, si tout comme moi, vous détestez les restos surpeuplés, je ne recommande pas. J'ai toujours cru qu'aller bruncher entre amis doit être une expérience relax. Faire la file trente minutes avec l'estomac vide n'a rien pour me faire relaxer. Si ce problème ne vous gêne pas, alors je vous recommande. Pour ma part, je n'y retourne pas."}
{"text":"The lunch combo is very good. The lunch menu comes with 7 choices, All of them are 13.95 with soup, salad, main dish and dessert. I have tasted the chicken one. I like the meat and the rice coming with it. Very impressed."}

{"text":"Greeted in French with a warm smile and seated quickly. Our server transitioned easily into English without condescension. Very helpful as I can speak passable French and read and comprehend it reasonably well but it made it easier for my family to order.   The location is easy to find. Outdoor patio seating is available. Comfortable and spacious booth that easily accommodates the generous portions they serve. Service is fantastic. Very attentive. Plenty of natural sunlight. Also liked the fact that they had televisions situated throughout without being intrusive.    The coffee is good. I had eggs over easy with toast, potatoes, Italian sausage and French toast. Eggs were perfectly cooked, soft runny yoke the way I like. My daughter says the French toast was good. Moreover, as an American I appreciate the generous portions. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"went there a lot when i lived in the neighbourhood, love the food there, the servers are professional"}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago with my family and it was just OK. It is a generic breakfast place like all the others and the food is neither bad nor impressive. I had scrambled eggs and French toast which came with potatoes, bread and two measly pieces of fruit. The server was very nice and was always offering us a fresh cup of coffee. The food is pretty boring and I think you could do a lot better for breakfast in Montreal. Food 3/5 Service 4/5 Atmosphere 2/5 Value 4/5"}
{"text":"Une déception pour ma part, les plats restent assez basiques et sont que d'une qualité et quantité moyenne. Notre serveuse assez rude n'a pas non plus amélioré l'expérience, dommage..."}
{"text":"I was here Saturday June 6 - Long wait to get in, packed around noon, which is to be expected. It was exceptionnally hot and humid and their a/c wasn't working properly. So not the best environment to dine it when it's crowded, noisy and stuffy.  I've eaten at the Dix/30 location before and had way better experiences despite it being a smaller restaurant.  I simply did not like the plate I ordered - I opted for a ham and cheese crepe and thought that the ingredients would be incorporated in the batter or crepe itself, kind of like an omelette, but it was just a thin crepe folder over with 3 slices of ham that smelled funky. This wasn't the thick pink breakfast ham I'm used to having, it looked more like pastrami or bologna. Did not taste or smell fresh. Was totally disgusted. Waitress also never came by to ask how the food was or offered any coffee refills.  Plus this location doesn't have caramel or honey for your toasts. Feels like they skimped out."}
{"text":"Nice place for family and friends gathering, food is very delicious and the portions are big for the price."}
{"text":"This place is crazy crowded on a Sunday at noon. The line up is huge! The waitresses are literally running from table to table to make sure everyone is getting a good service. I thought since I'm in Montreal, I'd pick a French breakfast and ordered Crepes. I asked for both strawberries and blueberrie, which was not on the menu but they made it for me. The cream in the crepe is extremely rich. The crepe itself is huge, so you can even share it. Overall, It was a great experience. I got my coffee refilled frequently. The only problem is the noise level!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. They have a great selection for breakfast and for lunch week days. The portions are huge. All produce including the fruits are always fresh year round. The staff is amazing, I've been coming here for 6 years and some of them have become part of our family.   Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast joint in the middle of a plaza outside Montreal. There was a silly lineup on Sunday late morning and I gotta say while the food was good, it really isn't worth the wait.  They have some good combos that are MMassive, with eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, toast, AND a pancake filled with fruits and chocolate or cream.  All in all, I'll have to say goodbye mon coco, never again."}
{"text":"Pretty solid breakfast. Very good service, tasty food, good prices. I thought this was going to be like an IHOP when I walked in, but it's quite a bit better."}
{"text":"Brunch copieux. Grand choix de jus et de smoothies. Un peu d'attente mais cela valait le rapport qualité-prix."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a little hidden restaurant near Des Sources. Surrounded by stores in an L-shape strip, it might be a little bit hard to spot. Although the lineups do get long so be cautious of peak hours.  FOOD: I personally think that other brunch spots are better. I find that Allo Mon Coco lacks flavor or simply something that just makes them stand out. The buckwheat crepes weren't special, and I find that their cheeses taste cheap. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. I will say that their potatoes are pretty good though.  PRICE: They offer standard prices, it's your typical brunch menu. Nothing too cheap or too expensive.   SERVICE: The waitress was very friendly. She made sure our cups were full and was happy to talk to us."}
{"text":"The ratings did not seem that good for this location for mainly the service. But for us Service was excellent.  Food as always good and very large portions. I believe the success of this place has to do with the price and portion. They simply work on volume.  I had a club sandwich for lunch and if I wanted I could have skipped the next 3 days of meals but I am greek and food is religion for us!!! Great food and service."}
{"text":"An excellent place for breakfast. The place is comfortable and very open. Portions are bordering on the large side but I enjoy that when I go for brunch.  Our waitress (unfortunately I forgot her name) was nice and efficient even though we had her running around a bit. When you have kids there's always something they need (ie. extra napkins, more water, extra plate, more utensils) I'm sure all parents understand. She was always glad to help out and always had a smile.  People that complain about cholesterol and what not need to go get a life. Order something healthy then. I can't stand when people order eggs, bacon, potatoes and then complain that they are greasy. Breakfast in my opinion is eggs, pancakes, bacon, toast, ham etc. If you're looking for bran flakes, then stay home.  Prices were very good for the amount they give you. This place is what breakfast should be."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here.   First time, it was great! Got the cheddar and spinach buckwheat Pancakes. It came with a ton of potatoes and some fruit. It was delicious and quite cheap. Around 17 if I recall correctly. The staff was really funny and attentive. Just a wonderful experience!   Second time, I decided to order the same thing, because I just didn't get enough of it. I wanted more! However, the waitress barely came over to see us and after my coffee was empty, she passed by multiple times and didn't refill. I ended up asking for a refill.   She came by three times. Once to take our order, once to deliver it and once for us to pay. It's understandable, right? But when I'm my meal came, she gave me an omelette. If I got something similar to a buckwheat pancake, I would've taken it and appreciated the change. However, an omelette was nowhere near what I wanted. I don't even like omelettes that much! When I told her it wasn't what I ordered, she apologized once and told me I should just take it, because the kitchen is busy. So, I did. She didn't come back till we were done and just gave us our bill. Oh and funny thing, the coffee refill I asked for, it never came."}
{"text":"Bon resto de déjeuner. Très populaire donc presque toujours une fils d'attente.  Le menu est différent des restaurants de déjeuner habituel. Oui cela reste des oeufs, des crêpes et autre chose de déjeuners, Mais ce ne sont pas des combinaisons habituels.  Prix quand même un peu élever pour des déjeuners. Salle à manger très bruyante et pas très chauffer. Il ne faisait que 8 dehors et ont gelais à l'intérieur. Je ne veux pas savoir de quoi cela aurait l'air à -20.  J'y retournerai, Mais quand il fera plus chaud."}
