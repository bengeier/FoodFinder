{"text":"I have tried this Persian restaurant a few times and have been very impressed with the food. The stew dishes are delicious and the kabob (koobideh) was tasty/fresh with a nice presentation. The portions are big and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I created a page for this business just so I could write a review and remind myself never to buy their food again.

Ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich ($6.99, came with a drink) and it was the worst I've ever had by a long shot. I should have known when the person behind the counter ripped the pita twice when wrapping it. I should have known before that when he offered to put ketchup and Thousand Island dressing (?????????????????) on my sandwich. I should have known before that when I saw that the only toppings they have are salad, coleslaw, peppers, and jalapenos. That's salad, salad, pepper, pepper. I should have walked away when he bent down to microwave the burnt-tasting meat. I should have just gone somewhere else.

There was nothing redeemable about the food I ate. This is a location in the food court at the Emerald condos, so you'd be spoiled for choice anyway. There is no reason to go here."}
{"text":"We were thoroughly disappointed with the service provided by this restaurant.  We ordered on Uber eats and the restaurant quoted a delivery time of 40-50 min.  We received our food 2 hours later.  Upon contacting the restaurant, the only explanation that I received was that \"sorry it's busy\".   We received no apology.  We will never order from here again and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Koobideh plates are always tasty and prepared well to please your eyes and make you even more hungry. I like that their combo comes with a drink and prices are pretty reasonable.

A quiet place to enjoy delicious Persian koobideh yumm!!!"}
{"text":"I ate from the place two times in 7 days. The Gheimeh Stew Comb was good in addition to Vaziri Kabab Combo which was good as well. The staff was so friendly and nice in both visits. Would go again for sure."}
