{"text":"Don't bother spending your money at this manufactured, wannabe trendy, low budget, over priced shitbox. You'll leave feeling like a sucker. It took an hour to get our food (when it wasn't even busy) and it was NOTHING special. My $16 fajitas were comprised of a chicken breast, sloppy soft green bell pepper slivers and onion. My girlfriends $15 tacos looked like they were for a toddler they were so small and crappy. The trendy club music was just dumb, and the service was shit..."}
{"text":"Do NOT go. Despite being a \"Hawks\" bar... Ordered something but never got it. It was busy but 1 hour and still no food. While \"waitress\" was dancing around. Nahhhhhhhhh   Then I asked for it to go then get attitude... Nah. Spoke with manager and they refunded everything. Happy about outcome but not service.   #gohawks"}
{"text":"Great service! Very friendly atmosphere. Amazing food! Ruben you are the best!! Collette was extemely attentive and made us feel at home. Will definitely come back anytime!"}
{"text":"Food was super Americanized, my husband ordered a michelada and it looked like a watered down Koolaid, then we ordered friedice cream and it was nothing but soggy flakes on top of ice cream."}
{"text":"Came on game day, obviously expecting it to be busy. Got a table right away but didn't get a waiter sent to us for over 20 minutes until we asked a manager where he was. Not even a \"hi I'm so and so I'll be with you guys in just a few minutes\". I don't care that it's busy, the customer was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I called twice before coming down for the game Sunday. I called 12/24 and was told that they would be open by 9am or 10am, but the lady I talked to couldn't tell me for sure what time. I called back on 12/26 to check one more time,  and I was told that they would be open at 11AM since the game didn't start until 2:25PM.  We arrived just before 11AM on 12/25PM to find that the restaurant was full with a wait by that point, and the information that I was given to be completely off base.  We decided to go else where to enjoy the day.  I've been to Salt a few times since they opened as I work in the Westgate area, but the experience Sunday had me questioning whether I want to introduce it to any of my friends or family."}
{"text":"Fast service, great prickly margarita and pretty good food. Cool environment. Like the theme! Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Tried to go in to order some take out after the game, on the way to my hotel.  I'm 60 years old and sober.  Big fat bouncer stops me and tells me to \"go down there and stand in line.\"  Needless to say, I will never be back.  Jeez."}
{"text":"As I walked in I was greeted by a awesome young man named mike! He sat my friends n I down in his section and began to take our order! Not only was he knowledgable about the menu but he was also really nice and friendly made me n my friends feel really welcomed and helped decided from what to drink to what to eat I look forward to go back and sit in mikes sections again for a fun time, great company n good food! thank u again mike !!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date after the Coyotes draft party.   I probably should have went somewhere else after talking to the waiter but I had faith.  I have a serious dairy allergy and he was not even familiar with dairy allergies.  After talking to him 3 times telling him exactly what to do, which should have been a sign for me to leave, I ordered my food.  I believe he used his best efforts.  The food tasted good but there was no guacamole on the carne asada guacamole tacos lol... The portions were real small and I left hungry.  Unfortunately they also did not follow my instructions as I ended up have a bad reaction to the food.   The waiter did his best but who knows what the cook did.  They need to be aware of food allergies they are actually very common.  Luckily mine is not life threatening but someone else could be.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We've only had chips and salsa since we arrived because the place is packed - Coyotes game tonight!  The reason for the review is not the food, it's the service. Kyra has been absolutely the best wait person we've had in a long time. She's attentive and observant despite the packed house.  If you go, ask for her!"}
{"text":"Typically westgate  service.... bartenders just want to talk with themselves. . The one with long brown hair picked her nose in front of me!!! not ever coming back"}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive and friendly service with solid Mexican food. This is not a home cooked, creative Mexican meal. But we had nice Mexican fare and a variety of different types of margaritas in a fun, energetic atmosphere.  The wait staff was very attentive, efficient, and friendly.   This was a good time with good food."}
{"text":"2nd time here. No wait during the weekdays staff very friendly including managment. Servers were on top of refills and making sure we had everything. The food is always fresh.  From the kids plates to adult plates the serving sizes are huge. If you have not been here it is worth trying. You won't be unhappy"}
{"text":"Don't even try it!  When we got there there were only a few tables taken, however the hostess took a long time seating us. We sat by the bar, the bartender was our server and he is the only reason I gave this review two stars instead of one. He was nice and friendly and got our drinks to us right away. But... Nothing else after that was good. Especially for the price you pay. My chicken tacos were ok, but the rice and beans tasted like they came from a can. I tasted a bite of my mom's shrimp taco, and it was the worst shrimp I have ever had in my life! If there is such thing as shrimp jerky that was it! How do you even make shrimp that dry, tough, and rubbery? Awful! We should've known from the salsa that we shouldn't have eaten there. But now you know, don't do it!"}
{"text":"Have gone here twice after Coyotes games. Lot of fun. Food is good, margaritas are tasty, but glass size could be bigger for $11.00 per margarita. Alyssa is a super friendly server who i always look to see if working. Great customer service by Alyssa."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the wait staff. We were seated pretty quickly for it being a Friday night but once we were seated, our server never came. A server brought the table next to us their food and even came back later to ask how they were doing. Not once did she even acknowledge that we were even there. We waited for 15 minutes and no one ever came. Either there's not enough staff for a restaurant this size or they just don't know how to handle actually being busy. I can understand a rush and waiters trying to get their tables served but the fact we weren't even acknowledged is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Headed up to Westgate early today to have dinner before Coyote game with a friend. First time to this Salt.  Seated quickly (we were early), drinks quickly as well as food.  HOLY NACHOS BATMAN.  Huge.  And, real, large chunks of STEAK, not processed junk. Wish we only ordered that to split, enough for two!  I had the chicken quesadilla...it was very good! Manager Tim came by, super friendly...he helped my friend chose her next drink a very spicy interesting sweet and spicy margarita.  Tim came by to check on us several times, as did our waitress.  We noticed that he stopped at several tables chatting with patrons.  We had shade seats outside, PERFECT on this beautiful night.  As for the negative reviews, here is my opinion:  I understand wanting to support the Cards and yes, odd a Hawk bar is on Card turf....but for the love of sports......QUIT BITCHING, enjoy food, drink, friends, sport and just relax.  Awful things are happening in life every second around the world.  Relax.  Those of you complaining about timely seating or service....sorry, did you forget you are in the 6th largest city in the country?  At one of the busiest places in the city?  During tourist season (and spring break AND SPRING TRAINING)   YEP, you are gunna have to wait, get their early and chill out.    Pricy?  See above paragraph.  Duh.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, drinks, food and service.  I will go back.  (early in the day)  Thanks Salt, and thanks Tim!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch, we literally asked for everything that wasn't on the menu and got it perfectly with no attitude from the staff. We needed a good Mexican restaurant over here and I'm glad we finally have one! All of the staff was very friendly and accommodating. One of the managers made us some bean dip that was absolutely amazing as well, We hope this place stays around."}
{"text":"Salt is awesome! Great atmosphere, staff, and food! We sat on the patio by the fountains for taco Tuesday and had a blast! Ask for Collette to be your server, she totally rocks! And maybe if you're lucky, Ruben will stop by to say hi! Can't wait to come back for another fun girls night!"}
{"text":"We live very close to Westgate but hadn't been there in a very long time. We didn't realize that Salt was even there until they hosted an event for our kids school. I can't say enough about their management team and willingness to support the community.  We've been in at least once a week, since discovering them.  Each time our service and food have been excellent, and we've tried everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before a hockey game b/c we couldn't get a table at the Yard House. We were seated in the outdoor dining area where the music was positively blaring. We were with 2 other couples who we really wanted to spend time chatting with. The noise level of the music made conversation impossible. The server twice tried to get the volume turned down for us but w/o success. We asked for the manager, who also said he'd turn it down but it never happened.  The food and margaritas were quite good, as was the service, but we won't be back unless we are in the mood for really loud music that's not of our choosing."}
{"text":"It's a Seahawks bar walking distance from the Cardinals stadium.  No respect for Your Home Team. You should be shut down!  No one even offered me a menu either. The service sucks!  You only got a star because I couldn't post without one."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Very nice server. Unfortunately the food was subpar at best. Very dry and flavorless.  I'll give it a 3 star because of the very nice people that work at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars because it does have a good vibe. However, the music is a little slow. I would like to see more of a mix rather then just spanish. Also... the margaritas are pricy for the small dixie cup they come in. Tasty... but expensive."}
{"text":"Service is excellent.  The best crispy fish tacos in Glendale.  Loaded fries enough to feed 2 with delicious.  A good after work hangout bar."}
{"text":"If you want to get store bought chips with your guac (and no salsa) and cold meals....then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Loving this place!! Great service! Amazing atmosphere !! Tasty food! Ruben made us feel at home and our server Collete was more than helpful and kind!!! This will be the place to be"}
{"text":"We ordered doubles, drinks were premixed and had no tequila in them. When we let the waitress know she took our drinks behind the bar and tried to spit in them discreetly-not well enough because we saw her. This place is terrible. Save your money and go to Yard House."}
{"text":"We  went to this bar tonight because they had a Seahawks event tonight.  Had a fantastic dinner (carne asada). Great food, great drinks, great dj. Meet couple of great employees including Nichole (our waitress) and Tim, the general manager. We will be back. Thanks Brian"}
{"text":"We went to an event as part of a conference here.  The margaritas were great and the view from the second floor was awesome."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place, I mean where do I begin from the excellent food to the awesome attentive service to the great friendly atmosphere and not to mention the music was on point Salt. Not to mention we even got bottle service and from working in the industry is can definitely say they take care of you to make sure you have a blast! made our weekend one for the history books. I would like to give a special thank you to Preston for taking care of me and my 5 friends definitely made our experience exceptional!"}
{"text":"AWFUL GAVE MY CARD TO SOMEONE ELSE AT THE BAR AND CHARGED IT! Girls at the bar don't know what they are doing! They need to be more careful and not give attitude when it's their mistake and I saw it happen."}
{"text":"First time here and Our waitress Crystal was amazing !! Very pleasant , Great energy helped us with making choices and had a smile that lights up the room!!  Not to mention tacos have amazing flavor!! My new fav spot for TacoTuesday!!  Ask for Crystals  section she really makes your experience great !!"}
{"text":"Heard about Salt  that I decided to give it a try with a friend. Our server was Michael who was such a doll! He was honest about what food he liked and helped narrow our options. 10/10 would recommend Michael as your server. The food was aiight. Michael gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night and it was a great time with great music. The only downfall was that they have girls out in front saying that you get a free shot ticket upon entering but you have to pay a $5 cover...then getting to the bartender to find its a shot that they make in exchange for your ticket and NOT a shot of YOUR choice. But it was a fun night besides that!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a margarita before we went across the street to dinner.  The service was poor to the point where we needed to ask for a waitress to take our order and left money on the table because she never came back with a bill.  The food that was coming out while we were sitting at our table looked good and the margaritas were decent.  Not sure with that service if I will ever give this place a shot for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here many times on Taco Tuesday. Really great Tacos and good deals on drinks. Went yesterday before the Cardinals game with some friends had lots of other menu items they were all great. The staff was all very friendly and helpful lots of TVs great atmosphere inside with a really cool outdoor seating. A must go"}
{"text":"Was not a pleasant first experience. My drink had an ice cube with a bug frozen inside of it and when I told the waitress she didn't even apologize and just brought out another drink. Food was okay, had the carne asada burrito but towards finishing it, there was blonde hair in it. Will not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 or 5 times now. The only reason I keep going back is for the taco Tuesday. Tacos are GREAT, and good price ONLY on Tuesdays. Besides that, they are a little on the pricey side for the entire menu.  HUGE disappointment that a Mexican restaurant 1. Does not have strawberry margaritas and 2. Does not have blended margaritas and 3. Charges  $4 for chips and salsa. I would order a margarita here if they had better ones.  Service: Some days have been good and others just ehh.  Good atmosphere and nice outside patio in front of the fountain."}
{"text":"Good chain restaurant. Nice atmosphere if you sit outside. Basically like a nicer version of Chipotle or Qdoba. I would recommend it although there margaritas are a bit over priced. The service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this taco joint!   Excellent service,  Taco Tuesday is so affordable for out of this world carne asada tacos.   Juicy juicy big chunks of meat.   The Santa Fe chicken tacos are great as well!  Love the creamy habenero sauce.   Then came some dessert,  peanut butter chocolate churros.  Wow."}
{"text":"Marcus and Junior literally provided the worst customer service ever. They are so disrespectful they told my cousin she had a funny looking face and that she shouldn't come in as often. Rudest guys ever!!!!!! Never coming back to this place because of these two guys. Second time we came in Marcus said \"You look Mexican as fuck\" to my boyfriend and didn't let us in because he \"didn't belong there\" when we told him we were writing a review about him he said \"well idc I'm not losing my job over you losers\" so sad that Salt hires people like these two guys. I will definitely pass the work onto all of our friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Adobo tacos are delish... the half order of nachos was huge!! Definetly enough for 2 people, the fajitas are also on point... great drink specials and its located in the westgate district , at night it comes to life with dj and music, i enjoy coming out here and also the food menu !!"}
{"text":"Came with a group and the service on drinks was slow, the food was slow and the tastes mellow.  I would not come again although it sure looked like a fun place.  I got the Carne Asasa burrito. First bite pulled out a huge chunk of meat that should have been much more portionable.  Three of us got the tortilla soup.  Presentation was on par but taste was not.  Over all the flavors wet just not interesting.  The Gringo sante fe come with no frys.  Just oddness all round."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place. We went back last night wanting to take advantage of their taco Tuesday deals that we saw advertised. We were on our way back from an event, and I called to see what time they closed. I was told they closed at 2am. I hung up the phone and realized that they probably stop serving food earlier, so I called back and asked what time the kitchen closes, and I was told 11pm. Perfect.  So we head that way, and the a-frame sign advertising taco Tuesday is still outside. The security guy up front checked our ID and we went in, but there was no one at the hostess stand, so my husband asked the guy where we should sit if we want food. He said to sit anywhere. We went and picked a table and waited for a few minutes. A man who I am assuming was the manager came over and let us know that the kitchen was closing at 10pm and if we wanted to order food he could have them make it before they closed. It was a few minutes to 10pm. I told him I had just called and I was told it was open until 11pm, but that we could just leave if they were closing. We drove 30+ minutes down to Westgate to give the place another try because they said they would be open, and ended up eating at YardHouse instead. SO disappointing. We really liked their food and drinks last time, but service was the issue. It seems like that is still the theme and I wish that wasn't the case. If they're not open late, it's not a big deal - but the staff informing me of that when I called to ask 30 minutes before we got there would have saved a lot of frustration for us. The only redeeming event last night was that the manager was extremely nice and offered to accommodate us even though it would inconvenience them. He also responded to my last review offering to have us come in again, which was very nice - although I never took him up on it, and I wish I had, because I'm sure we would have had a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day, after going to Kabuki upstairs. Kabuki was dirty & no greeting at our table, so we left.  Salt Tacos & Tequila, not busy, sat outside in the patio, server was great! Loved the music outside and the food, good portions, great taste! Forgot to ask for my free chocolate covered strawberries for Mother's Day :( . But overall will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to spend money here and was turned away because they were on a wait. Ok, so what's my issue?  There were open tables all over the place but they claimed they were waiting for people to respond who were on the waitlist. Here's a suggestion guys, when you have people in front of you with money to spend and a game starting in an hour take the money in front of you!  Business 101!"}
{"text":"Great DJ, lively crowd, friendly staff and great food and drinks ...all around 5 stars !!!"}
{"text":"Me and some of my family walked into this place to have some drinks before went over to the Cardinals game this past Saturday. I had the biggest plate of nachos ive ever seen, it took 3 of us to finish it. The nachos were sooooo good. I will returning to this spot the next time im in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Chipotle shrimp tacos are my favorite!!!! They also make the drinks strong ! Very fun place to go before a Coyotes game ! I just wish their salsa was a little spicier !"}
{"text":"My first and very last time coming here. We were playing beer pong on the patio for my friends 21st birthday had a good time when my friend went to get a ball that bounced off the patio and out into the walkway and with no alcoholic beverage he went to go retrieve it not knowing he wasn't allowed and that we needed to find a security guard to go get it for us. Our friend ended up being told to go back around to the front(which is totally okay there was no argument) by a security guard Chester Brown who then went to the front and told security to not allow him back in. When we found out we all went to pay our tab and leave to McFaddens when Chester then approached our table very disrespectful saying \"you have an issue I wouldn't let your friend back in then get the fuck out.\" And would only answer \"he didn't have to do anything wrong i don't want him in here i can do whatever i want in here\" When I asked his name he told me it was none of my damn business so I left out the front entrance standing next to the ID podium to wait for the rest of our group when Chester then again followed me and very aggressively continued to approach me getting closer until he's back me up to the edge of the fountains still trying to argue with me when i had left to avoid confrontation. Another security guard had to step in and tell Chester to return back inside. I never caught the security guards name who then talked to me respectfully APOLOGIZING FOR HIS COWORKERS ACTIONS, and giving me Chesters name."}
{"text":"We were sat down at our table, just two of us. Another table was sat down 6mins later and server was there immediately, upon seconds. We waited another 8mins and still no one came to us. We walked out."}
{"text":"Only 3 servers working, 1 kept hiding in the back, 2 sitting at a table flirting with a guy ignoring her other tables, 3 actually dojng her job. Tried calling ahead to place order so I wouldnt spend my whole lunch break waiting they had the phone unplugged. Saw the servers putting dishes in a bucket under the counter???? Got my food and it was wrong and they took the little cup of salsa and covered it in beans also the salsa was bad, like it was spoiled... who gives a customer spolied food????"}
{"text":"We had a delightful experience here before the Cards game. Beer was cold, waitress awesome, and nachos piled to the roof--for the HALF order! Can only imagine the full size. Margaritas were top-notch."}
{"text":"Amazing place! For starters they have Pepsi :) then the margarita was soooo yummy. Then we went on to order the potato tacos. They are some of the best I ever had at a restaurant. The flavor was just like mom makes them.  It's came with rice and beans that made it perfect. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Terrible. Just plain terrible. We came here on a non game day Sunday and got seated inside. The waitress got our orders for drinks, and took fifteen minutes to get three beers and a coke, no joke. We were sitting five feet from the bar, the manager, bartender, or any other person never wondered why we were sitting on a high top in the bar area without even water. When the drinks did finally come, they forgot the coke, which should have been the easiest. The soup was cold and we had to send it back as well. My only conclusion is that they must get so much business from the games that they really don't care about service. Not only am I not coming back here, I have told everyone going to any future cardinals games to avoid this place at all costs as there are too many other options in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"I visited here recently and while the tacos were amazing , the margaritas are better!! I had a brand new server by the name of Katie, and she greeted us right away. For a new server she sure knew what to recommend, she recommended the blood orange margarita and it was delicious! I'm a part of the service industry so customer service is always a big thing for myself. The atmosphere is great and the view from the front patio is gorgeous!! I will be back for sure and hope Katie will be there to service me again"}
{"text":"Costumer service poor as the waitress/ bar tender took 10 minutes to get us a menu as there was only 5 people around the bar.  The taco was bland had to put salt and pepper to make a little tasty as the food was  food bland.  My first drink a tequila sunrise was so sweet you could not tell if the tequila was even in the drink.  I ordered a soda and the first one was flat they said they had to change tanks, they brought me another soda and it was still flat.  At least they didn't charge me for the soda.  My friend had some coffee and said that it was a good cup.  Should have gone with the coffee. How this place will stay open until football season I don't know if service and food doesn't improve."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Saturday night. We were there for drinking, and having a night out after a really bad matter happened to one of my friends. We were there just sitting at a table that's outside and around 1245am, one of my friends had decided that he wanted to buy a table. We were drunk, but not horribly drunk to where we shouldn't have been in the bar. My friend that had bought the table left to go to the bathroom right after (2 minutes) they had given us our bottle. My other friend and I hadn't even drank from the bottle, and while the person who bought the table was in the bathroom, they escorted us out and told us that we were too drunk to be there. So, my friend that just bought a table, which we were around for and the girl we got escorted out by, was the one taking our order to get the table was there -- if we were that drunk, why didn't you deny us the table before we bought it? Instead, they took my friends money, and got the two bottles of alcohol that weren't even drank out of to sit at a table for 10-15 min. The only good thing about this place was the music. We won't be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Good place for some tasty nachos. Situated across from the Gila River Arena. Nice view of the fountains for outside seating. Watch out, the bathroom has an attendant in the evenings. She's super nice at least.  My friend and I ordered carnitas nachos and beers. The nachos were on a huge platter. And delicious with more than enough for two. Meat was shredded and tender, not stringy. Cheese sauce was good and a little spicy. Came with sour cream, salsa and jalapeños. Only reason they get 4 stars was that our order of nachos was dry inside. Once we ate the top, we were left with chips. After I pointed this out to the server, he right away got us more queso fundido. Perfect. Server was really attentive. Actually all the servers were really nice. Bartenders were great when I asked them for beer and shot combo suggestions. Beer on tap was typical of a Mexican restaurant.  The place becomes a dance club on weekends so they were clearing out tables as we ate, but we never felt rushed to leave."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight during the Final 4. Was quickly seated given the time of day, though view of the TV wasn't the greatest until I asked if we could sit at a particular table. Our server Teegan was great and very attentive. Would have liked to see a larger menu, but understandable given the \"event\" menu. We were still very pleased with our meal choices and service! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times. I am currently working my way around the menu. Mostly everything is worth trying a 2nd time."}
{"text":"Only experience was on a Saturday afternoon of day drinking. We decided to visit & opted for the indoor bar as the weather is already getting pretty warm. The staff was quick & helpful. They have 2 sizes of draft beers & a good selection of beers on tap. We opted for the 32oz Kilt Lifter our local fave & shared (if I don't share those big dog beers always heat up on me). The experience was good & we'll be back to check out the nightlife & dinner soon. The prices for the portions that we saw looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Went on a sat afternoon the food was just ok if it wasnt  for the great margarita selection i wouldnt have given any stars. i wont be back ,if your name has tacos in it you should probably have amaxing tacos"}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Briana! Manager is always involved to ensure a great experience! Atmosphere is fun too!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but too many mistakes were made to give this a better review. We were seated quickly and the waiter brought water and menus promptly. However, that was as good as it got. The margaritas were brought without salt even though we both requested salted rims, so they needed to be repoured. The waiter was too busy to pay us much attention, but when he was there, he was knowledgeable about the menu. The food was good, I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were sweet (unexpected, but good), and barbacoas, which was quite spicy. The waiter disappeared for a while and when he returned with our checks, they were wrong and had to be redone... twice. The bathroom was not clean, one stall out of order. Really no reason for me to go back, even if I lived locally."}
{"text":"We ordered the tacos which comes with a well portioned rice and beans.  The rice and beans are better than most run of the mill Mexican places. The carne asada steak was tasty with guacamole and pico only. The corn tortilla used make for a poor first impression and also take away from the overall, the carne tacos are ok for the $8 paid.  This other taco plate was un-breaded fish. Very bad texture and way over the top spicy which wasn't described on the menu. I love very spicy, super spicy food but the was totally out of context with the tacos.  Really wired to me.  They were $10 with rice and beans.  Although the price was ok for the ok food, there is absolutely nothing that would bring me back to eat again. It does look like a great place to have some beers and watch the Cards!"}
{"text":"For a place called 'Salt' I found it odd that arriving at 9:30 (they close at 10) that the bar staff had already put away the margarita salt!  The second we walked in the unfriendly bartender let us know that the kitchen was closed.  That's fine, but we still wanted a drink.  Sitting there, a couple dozen other people came in (a Coyote's game ended about 9:30) and were ignored by the staff, which was too busy cleaning so that they could leave ASAP at 10.    The margarita that I did have (with no salt!) was actually pretty darn good and would garner a 4 or 5 star rating!  There are plenty of other bars open in the Westgate area, and after leaving Salt, spent several more hours in the area at bars that were open, serving food and full of people!"}
{"text":"Amazing nachos and the tacos are awesome.  Even the rice and retried beans are flavorful.  Major recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"The food was bad.  Paid $4 for chips and salsa.   Any self respecting Mexican restaurant doesn't charge for chips and salsa.  Waited 15-20 minutes for a drink order.  Was given the wrong menu by the hostess.  The food was TV dinner at best.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I won't ever go anywhere else for Mexican food in Arizona! I've brought several people here who were impressed too!   I've been here weekdays, weekends, all hours of the day and NEVER have I received anything but AMAZING service and delicious food. From margaritas, wine, strong cocktails, even Shirley Temple's, to tacos, enchiladas, carne asada burritos, and all ensaladas-NOTHING disappoints!   Absolute favorite is the traditional enchilada with green sauce. It's so much food, I always get to take home leftovers for a midnight snack or breakfast. Also love how they don't skimp on the cilantro in the salsa!  The interior is like none I've ever seen-the decor is visually appealing. Not to mention this destination has several ambiances-sit outside and people watch close the outside bar, sit at the inside bar where there are 7+ big screen tvs viewable from anywhere in the restaurant, take a booth or table on the main floor where happy hour takes off, or if you're wanting something more intimate-the elevated bar off to the right of the dance floor is perfect with plenty of big screen tvs as well.   Music selection is on point weekend nights! And their instagram giveaways are awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to Salt a couple times on the weekend during the night life but never to eat. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out for sate night.  I ordered a BUILD A BOWL, same idea as chipotle. I had it with chicken. It ran about $12 for the bowl and they totally skimped out of the lettuce and the rice was a little mushy. The flavor was ok, probably wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and he said they were ok. The food definitely tasted as if it was pre cooked too far in advance, it was literally served to us 5 mins after ordering. Probably wouldn't go back to eat. (The waitress was also a little moody and it showed)"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends. Drinks are over priced for the price you are paying you would think you can actually be served in a glass nope-plastic. Service was terrible it was slow and each received food and drinks and different times. We didn't eat at the same time as we were not served timely. Paid our tab and was asked if we wanted out change of $37. Never again."}
{"text":"Decent. Tacos are alright, nothing special or fancy about them.  Service is good too.  I miss Jimmy Buffet's to be honest though (it was here prior to Salt)."}
{"text":"Went here after a Cardinal practice session and had a few drinks and a meal. The place was nuts. There were all sorts of people in Cardinal gear, had a \"best fan\" competition, and then they brought in some kid dance groups that performed.  My meal was good.  Someone down the bar from me ordered the nachos and holy crap were they massive. Like, this is the reason that Europeans think we all a bunch of fat asses. Those. Nachos."}
{"text":"I have been here both during an weekday night and on a Saturday night when they are getting packed and I am glad to say that the service and food are the same quality each time, EXCELLENT! My husband and I love their tacos and drinks. The food comes out hot and FAST! I never have to hunt for our server and there are no empty drinks on our table. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The most over priced crapp in town 72.00 for 4 beers and a nachos.never again Westgate Robery unbelievable . Native.is across.the street highly recomended.and a lot less on the wallet."}
{"text":"My wife's chicken came in luke warm. If the staff had been paying attention in the food safety course they were required to take, they would know that food safe temperatures are from 39 degrees to 140F. The chicken on her salad was sitting comfortably at 75, which isn't good. My enchiladas had the taste of canned chicken. All of it had been sitting around for a long time before we got there. The manager told me that their last health inspection was an \"A\" but I was unable to verify that.   For $16 a plate they should make the food fresh. There's no reason to recycle lunch leftovers for dinner. Furthermore nothing we had required intense preparation afterwards.   Everyone has bad days, but that still doesn't make it acceptable. The drinks were good, but were they good enough to risk getting sick? Not for us.   The manager did the right thing and took care of our ticket. That's why this review is two stars."}
{"text":"Mass produced Mexican food at a high price. The location was great, but the quality and taste of food was a great disappointment. Chicken burrito was a few pieces of dried out chicken and 2 pounds of white rice rolled into a soft shell. The beer prices are way too high. A great place to sit and have water and take in the atmosphere, but not a place to eat and drink... great disappointment."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner tonight. Great customer service and the food was good. I had a poblano burrito and my husband had green chili burrito. He didn't like his much no green chili and lots of meat.i thought my burrito was good."}
{"text":"If you want crappy food and even crappier service with complimentary excuses, this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"Rude front staff we went there tonight and the front staff gave us attitude when seating us...this is not kid friendly. Avoid this place and go for a short drive to any real Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice - once for dinner shortly after they opened, and today for lunch.   Mediocre service both times. The first time when we ordered drinks the waitress insisted we give our credit card up front to open a TAB. We assumed she was confused about the TAB policy, but still it was off-putting. The second time our waitress didn't come to us until about 10 minutes after were were seated and the guy (manager on duty?) took our drink orders and hunted down the waitress. Waitress was nice but not attentive; we should have gotten refills more than the one time.   Food is meh and overpriced. The menu is very limited and considering how few people there were in the restaurant the food took a long time to get to us.   We really wanted to like this place but I don't think we'll be back, unless it's to check out any happy hour they might have. But we definitely won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday menu is dope! Came here on a Tuesday, and got a bunch of the potato tacos and they were great. Service was good, and selection of tequila was big! The manager, (Steve I think) came to check on us, and was very nice. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Brought to you by the same guy who owns Whiskey Rose next door.  Salt is being touted as a modern Mexican food joint.  It is located in the old Margaritaville spot in the center of Westgate (aka Restaurant Cemetery).  I tried the shrimp ceviche a carne asada quesadilla.    The ceviche had pieces of zucchini in it and was a good size.  But it did not taste freshly made and was overpowered with lime juice.  It needed some heat and less citrus.  It was 14 bucks for about a cup and came with chips on the side.    The carne asada quesadilla was a good size and came with a tomatillo salsa on the side.  The tomatillo salsa was not good.  It needed more spices and heat.  The quesadilla was good but could have been better if they served it with a pico de gallo and sour cream or guac.  I believe it was $13.  The service was pretty good.  The place was dead right after training camp so that was a bad sign.    The beer menu was lousy.  Closest thing to craft was Big Wave by Kona.  Any modern place should have some modern beer no?  I'd take authentic Mexican food or street Mexican food with fresh chips and salsa anytime over this.  For the price, product, and beer selection I really don't think I'd have a reason to come back here.  Westgate has a collaboration of some of the most mediocre restaurant offerings in the valley unfortunately.  They could use some new blood."}
{"text":"I have never been treated as poorly in a restaurant as I was today at Salt. My friends and I were part of a crowd from the arena next door so the place got really full, really fast. We could tell Salt knew a crowd was coming. They were using a limited menu and had posted signs asking patrons to allow 45 minutes to an hour to get food after ordering and preparing \"groups of 1 or more\" in other words, everybody, for an automatic 20% gratuity. After being seated, we were literally ignored. After 30 minutes, we caught a server going by and asked if she would take our order. Over an hour later, most of our food came, but not all, and half of what we were brought was cold. Our drinks hadn't been refilled. As we began discussing our issue with one of the managers, he accused us of seating ourselves. So that explained why we had been ignored. I was very understanding of the situation due to the crowd and all until that point. I had the hostess tell him that was not the case and that she had seated us. I could not believe they had treated us that way based on a false assumption. The manager never apologized."}
{"text":"We had the overpriced chipotle style Carne Asada bowl with cold rice and beans. When you go into a restaurant with your Groupon and you spend your $20 minimum purchase, they still charge regular price for their happy hour drinks. For that, I will not return."}
{"text":"Two problems with this place. 1. They use two menu's - one is for nights with an event (Coyotes etc) and the other is non event. The event menu has half the items the regular menu has including charging $17 for a Carne Asada burrito, while the normal price is 9 bucks. Sounds like they need new cooks because I do not recall Cheesecake Factory having that arrangement. It is just pure greed. They also jack up the beer prices as I paid over $5 for a Bud Light bottle. Go during a non event night if you don't want to get ripped off or better yet, go to another place named SALT that is not owned by someone from Seattle.   2. This is a major Seattle Seahawks bar as evidenced by the green balloons and hundreds of supporters filling the bar two weeks ago before the Cardinals/Seahags contest. This should not be occurring in the shadow of the Cardinals stadium, but this is par for the course in Arizona. Blame the Westgate owners for letting this occur and boycott this place (and Whisky Rose) if you support Big Red.  P.S. Seahawks lost, so now what...you gonna put some red balloons up now?"}
{"text":"Davian rocked out! We had the coolest server, ever!   My daughter and I decided to check out Taco Tuesday at Salt and was not disappointed with the $1, yes $1 Ground Beef Tacos. They also offer potato and veggie tacos for that price point. For $2 and $3, you had other types of tacos available.  Classic Margaritas are $8 but with Happy Hour, it is $2 off. I got mine with salted rim and blended so that raised the price. My drink was still very delicious and the tequila was nice and smooth.  We also ordered the hulking Salt nachos ($15) with carne asada ($3). It was well worth the price. They give a generous amount of home marinated steak. It has a nice tang and citrus finish. Wow! They melt shredded cheddar and cojita (maybe). It also has pickled sliced jalapeno, black beans and pico de gallo. You are a guacamole lover, you get 2 oz. for $3 more.   Davian took care of us, and were more than pleased with our meal and service. Thank you, Salt!"}
{"text":"Called Salt to book a holiday party and John responded.  John was awesome!  Very helpful, patient and accommodating!  He helped me plan everything.  Very happy with the service I received!  Would definitely book with them again."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday! And all you can drink mimosas on Sunday!! Let me tell you awesome how this is. My server Mikey is funny and was always full of entertainment and thats worth a lot when you're eating in a huge place, That is usually quiet during the day. I'll be back to come in again to sit in his section."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We went on a Friday night but didn't feel crowded even though there were many people there. The service was good and the food was great! I got the chipotle shrimp tacos and it was amazing! Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"Don't want to expend too much energy on this place so I will get to the specifics...  We walked in at happy hour and didn't even get asked if we wanted anything off the happy hour drunk or food menu.  Douchey big guy in a STT walking around being a \"bro\" rather than helping the place run.  Can't tell who the servers are because there's no uniform or name tags easily seen.  The only way we picked them out was they all had the same trendy, hipster black rim glasses.    We had a variety of tacos and nothing to write home about.  Highlight of the meal was the habañero salsa.   Tamales with chicken and verde sauce looked great but lacked meat and flavor.  They use cubed chicken which is odd because usually it's shredded....seemed like that's where the flavor usually happens is in the braised meat.   Good try STT.... Maybe you will get a manager in place to whip that place into shape and make it rock outside of the nightclub hours."}
{"text":"Haha! What is this place? Ordered the ceviche and it's not ceviche. Ordered a margarita and it was like Kool aid. Got the bill and it was twice as much as I'd expect for Mexican food. Waiter was on his game but felt bad for him because it was like he knew the place was not good. This place may be good to watch a game but that's it."}
{"text":"Food is good, great happy hour but outside of happy hour prices seem to be a bit high for the product. Shots are watered down and taste different."}
{"text":"We went to salt today for lunch. I have never had such horrible service at a restaurant. We sat there for 45 minutes before anyone took our order. We asked 4 different servers to help us and get us drinks. Finally someone came over. It took about 40 minutes to get our food. The tacos were okay.   It definitely wasn't worth the two hours we spent there for a couple of tacos."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch, and the restaurant was pretty empty which should have been a sign that something was up when all the other Westgate restaurants were pretty packed. Upon our entrance the host which also turned out to be the manager was pretty rude to us as she sat us down. As we looked at the menu, and we asked about the specific drinks the host / manager / server told us \"just look at the menu\". At that point I decided to find the manager, and when the server told us it was her I asked if we could get a different server. The new server came up and it was the same overall poor attitude, we are heading out from we decided to get out of there. On the menu however, the prices of the drinks were absolutely exorbitant and there was not that much choice in regards to different food items available. For that reason we will never go back and will let everyone else know that there are other choices that would be much better than this restaurant"}
{"text":"ATTENTION TOURISTS:  This is not a restaurant. This place is a bar. Do NOT go here for Mexican style food...Go here for beer, margaritas, and tequila...maybe the nachos??? Only saw them--neighboring table ordered them. We should have gone to the Yard House. Their menu is dishonest and embarrassing. If you want real and authentic (or Americanized but delicious) Mexican food-go to Los Dos Molinas, America's Taco Shop, Macayos, Aunt Chiladas, La Paloma...anywhere but here. Phoenix/Glendale-we have SOOO many places...Yelp that shit--wish I had"}
{"text":"This is the old Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville at Westgate.  I had the sea bass tacos and the meat was rubbery, cool, and bland.  Like some of the other reviews have said if you want a margarita or a beer go for it but if you are looking for Mexican food, this is not the place you want to go to.  Bleh....."}
{"text":"Dirty, awful service, patio is rotting, severely overpriced for the garbage you'll receive on a plate. Only go here if you hate yourself or love being mistreated as a consumer."}
{"text":"Margarita a bit short on alcohol but large on ice. Apparently $13 tacos that state that come with avocado sauce only do if you ask for what's suppose to come on them. No standard chips and salsa that comes at Mexican restaurants. Asked for salsa for burrito but never showed up. Just a disappointing meal on a Saturday night that really can't be blamed on being too busy. Too nancy other choices in this center."}
{"text":"Little disappointed. I was in Glendale for a weekend trip. My cousins and I figure its close to our hotel and figure we would eat here for lunch.  We both had the taco salad, and we both agreed its missing some ingredients. So much so that we actually took what was missing from her daughter's plate to mix it up a little. My little cousin had the beef tacos which she mentioned is very dry.  We're from California and it felt like we ate at a Sharkey's. This food did not exactly seem 'authentic' to us. The atmosphere is beautiful and the Marquita helped. Neither of us finished the salad except for the shell, my little cousin was picking on our shell as well as she did not finish her meal."}
{"text":"Haven't tried anything that I didn't absolutely love. Everything is good, the service is wonderful, and we couldn't love this place more!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing on taco Tuesday and our servers had the optimal customer service. Highly recommend if in the area and prime spot to enjoy ones self before a coyotes game."}
{"text":"Ok great place to happy hour Great food & great prices!!! But there is always that one thing right!?  For me its always cleanliness!"}
{"text":"Slow service, terrible margaritas,  I ordered Tres Generations it tasted like Cuervo, had the headache to prove it. Taco salad had lots of lettuce a good taco bowl and lots of lettuce. Chips and salsa were very good."}
{"text":"Discriminating and falsely accusing your customers of being something they are not is not a good way of doing business. My brother and I came in from out of town for Sunday Night Football at the nearby stadium. Fellow fans told us to come to this place for some post game drinking and fun. Apparently according to the bouncer, we were already drinking and did not allow us in because we were \"too intoxicated\". The problem is, that we hadn't drank alcohol at all yet. The only thing we had that whole day and at the game was overpriced soda and water. We were completely shocked and insulted so we asked to speak with a manager. We tried to plead our case and told him we were sober. Of course we were visibly upset and angry and the manager used that to justify that we were in fact intoxicated. \"Your being aggressive\" he said,\"Which shows me that you have been drinking too much\".  Seriously? Then out of nowhere he lies and says \" See, you just said you were drinking\".  Like where did that even come from?  A part of me thought, Does this guy just not like Mexicans since there we not many that I seen. I hate when people play the race card but that is just something that went though my mind at the time. Just an awful feeling period. Taking legal action is not even worth it and know there is probably not even a case as it is there right as a business to refuse service to whoever they want. That's fine, but they are not going to get away without at least a yelp review. Fortunately there were other bars there and we got in with no problems. 0 Stars!"}
{"text":"Can't believe how long it took me to write this but I've been waiting to! THIS PLACE WAS TERRIBLE! Service was crap, their beer selection was crap! Just ugh! We sat on the outside part of the bar while waiting for the dodgers game. We came here for spring training so March... yeah I know. Took a while to write. They had beers listed on their menu and the first 2 or 3 that we ordered they were out of or didn't carry. Then why are they on the menu. By the way she looked so annoyed with us when we were trying to order. Shot us an eye roll here and there. I was like woah lady! I've never seen you before in my life. Then we ordered Modelos which we assumed was draft since I thought we seen a handle for it and this place is called TACOS AND TEQUILA so I'd assume. Well their crappy rude \"bartender\" brought us bottles. When we asked about it on draft she said \"bottles is all we have right now\" and walked away. Rude. She didn't communicate at all. Ask a question and when we answered she would just walk away. Took forever to flag her down for our check. Needless to say we didn't order another beer and didn't order food. We took our business elsewhere. I took a picture of her so management can smack some manners into her. I know that seems petty but seriously this chick had a major attitude problem for absolutely no reason"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We go out on a Thursday night for a few drinks after spending time on the West side of town (Live the central/Biltmore area). This was the first place we arrived at. All 5 of us Late 20s early 30s showed security our IDs. Went to the bar ordered some drinks for 4 of us, paid the bill and right after i give my receipt to the bar tender I was approached by an over weight Hispanic male claiming he was security. Asked me to step a side and talk to him. He tells me that his boss informed him to ask us to leave cause we are over intoxicated. LOL I inform the man this was our first place and that one of our friends is Pregnant and is not drinking. He insisted that we have been drinking and needed to go. I asked to speak with the guy who pointed us out but he refused. We were not allowed to finish the drinks i just purchased. As we were leaving the security guard at the front says \"Leaving so soon?\" I told him we were getting kicked out for being too white, rich and for being sober. He laughed and said \"oh that's common here\"!  WOW! Reasons I don't go to the west side for anything but football. This place is a joke and I cant wait to see the the next place that comes in and takes over this failed establishment."}
{"text":"Went out on Cinco de Mayo, a flyer was sent out with promos which did not specify any time restrictions. We wanted to try it out since we have not yet been there, apparently there was a time restriction with their promos different times on margaritas, tacos and beers. Only after asking for a manager did they honor the promo since the manager was \"too busy\" to see us. By the time the tacos came out they were cold. By this time we were done. If you're going to promote, don't change your promo mid-night, make sure you're promoting quality-that's what will bring people back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I wanted to try this place at Westgate for a while and we finally got the chance to. The ambience was slow and quiet when we got there it was a Tuesday after work around 4. The food was good. I ordered the fish taco and shrimp taco. I didn't like the sauce on my shrimp taco I would suggest a more cilantro cream sauce than a sweet sauce they put on it. The chips and salsa where good. Salsa was cold and it's like most salsa at On the Border. I gave them 3 stars because I ordered a Cadillac Margarita and the waitress brought me it with the salt all poured of the rim because she spilled it over the edge, walking it to our table instead of using a tray to bring it to us. Allie our server was nice but spilling over my $12.00 drink was not acceptable and she didn't even offer to remake it or anything. Yes, $12.00 for a Cadillac margarita pricey. And it wasn't even the way I'm use to having them made it didn't taste like a Cadillac Margarita. I'd stop in here again just to get a Tuesday Taco Special. My fiancé had the pork and carne asada and he like them. And a bowl of Tortilla Soup. Beware the soup bowl is enough for 2 to share. We sat outside by the fountain and it was pleasant."}
{"text":"Waste of time  poor service when we walked in around 9:15pm and they close at 11pm. Employees stared at us and looked away. Another group walked in and they were treated the same. Finally walked over to the bar and was told they stop serving food at 9pm and drinks until 11pm. Perhaps this should be on a posted sign."}
{"text":"I want to give a 2 star, I really do, but as you read on, you'll see it's probably just 1.  The main reason - poorly managed!!  My family and I came here THE DAY BEFORE Cinco De Mayo, for my mom's birthday.  I called earlier in the week to make a reservation.  When my parents showed up before my husband and I, they said they didn't have my reservation.  I guess the hostess gave a little attitude about it but quickly changed her tune.  It was packed in there (there had been a motorcycle rally as well as a concert about to start at the arena next door), so they sat us upstairs, first in some dusty booth, then in the corner of their upstairs loft, by a bar that didn't have a tender.  We ordered 4 drinks and 3 shots, and our dinners.  They gave us complimentary guac and salsa with chips to offset the losing of the reservation.    THIRTY minutes later, our FOOD came out.  Where's the drinks? We asked.  Finally some busser brought our beverages about 10 minutes after we got our food.  They must have heard our grumbling, on top of our waitress yelling at her manager about how poorly the night was being run there, because a manager came to our table to apologize and offered to comp our drinks.  Our waitress was very sweet but unfortunately spread thin due to how busy it was.  This restaurant was not prepared, but I'm curious - they ARE aware of local events going on, AND it was CINCO DE MAYO, AND they're a MEXICAN restaurant!  HOW do you NOT prepare for that??  Waitress definitely had our best interest, and like I said, tore her manager a new one saying that waiting that long for food/drinks is unacceptable.  I guess they only had TWO bartenders working and the waiters had to get in line to submit their drink orders.  WTF??  I felt so bad for my mom because I PICKED this place to bring her and the family for her birthday dinner.  She said it would make for a funny story years to come.  Best part - comped drinks.  Worst part - everything else, ESPECIALLY POOR PLANNING ON MANAGEMENT'S PART!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. With a good sized party, about 15. Wait over 15 minutes to order a drink, no prob. Then another 45 minutes to remind the server twice he forgot our drinks. He was more concerned with the cleavage of a new guest to recognize my wife and I weren't too happy. After a third attempt to even get the guy to recognize us, I asked him to cancel two completely different drinks than we even ordered. He basically shrugged it off and ignored it like it was no biggy. Im sure our party was still charged for the drinks we waited over an hour for, and never got. Oh, forgot to mention, I watched him bring at least 20 drinks to other people in the immediate area that all ordered after us. Never will I ever return here. Gives the trendy restaurant title a very bad name. Bertos is better."}
{"text":"My group and I were really excited to try this new place. We get there and we find an open seat at the bar. We sit down and have a friendly smile on out faces excited to get some drinks before they Chainsmokers concert when have sat there for over 10 mins without out a \"Hi\" or a \"hello be right with you\". So finally I ask a little abruptly excuse me can we order some drinks. Never was checked on after we got our first round and had to ask for second. I  have worked in the restaurant business for over ten years and was supper disappointed in the service for what looked like such a fun place to go. Next time I will choose Mcfaddens which was such a blast and great service."}
{"text":"Location: It's where the original Margaritaville used to be is now become this place (Salt and tacos & tequila, it's between the  escalators in front of the dancing fountains.   Service: As far as atmosphere they changed a little bit, It's still looks a bit Margaritaville, They just changed it a little bit kind of Western in looking other than that they have a long ways to go the food wasn't that good the service totally sucks they were not very friendly at all mean a few friends sat down and then immediately the waitress came over and said we cannot sit there we had to go through the hostess, so we went back up to the front and then the hostess just put us back at the exact same table how stupid was that, The whole time we felt rushed she kept coming by do you need anything ask for some this to get something for us and the menu on us it was totally uncomfortable and ridiculous and the drinks were awful they taste like their water down I would never go to this place again but once again this is just my opinion but the party that I was with felt the same way I think they would need seriously a lot of improvement may be a whole new staffing, it was not a very popular place it was just very few people inside the place or the restaurant is just to entirely too big for the amount of customers are going to get through there which is not going to be very much I suspect it won't last very long.   $$$  The cost of the drinks and food were just competitively priced just your normal type of pricing maybe in time they will improve so maybe if I see the place really full and might pop in again but it's unlikely this so much more other better places to go to."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food and a Seattle Seahawks theme before the game. Plus the DJ was playing the best music."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my friend's 22nd birthday since there was no wait. It was my first time here! I ordered the carne asada quesadilla and it was really good. My friends ordered the carne asada tacos, shrimp tacos, and an enchilada. We also got the cheese chimi for dessert. Highly recommend it if you love cheesecake as much as i do! The server was super sweet as well. We ended up coming back at around 10:30pm since it turns into more of a bar/club. They remove the tables at the bottom and it turns into a dance floor. It was pretty poppin' lol I'm used to going out on Mill Ave and in Old Towne and this place definitely has a different vibe to it, but it was still really fun! The crowd is generally more older and more tamed lol"}
{"text":"Thought we would experience the local Mexican dining this afternoon while visiting Arizona.  We were immediately put off walking in the door by several people at a table having loud horns that they were continuously blowing.  It sounded like a group of whales dropping their mating calls..  There was also a live DJ playing music quite loudly that it was like being in a club at 2pm which is comical at best.  After debating for a short time of whether to just leave we decided to give the place a chance.  Due to the soccer game that would be taking place in the evening we continuously had people approaching our table peddling off Modelo brand items constantly.    We ordered a half order of nachos for the appetizer, the chili verde burrito, chicken breast entree and carne asada enchiladas.  The nachos showed up and they were huge, overall they were pretty good.  However the waitress told us our food was coming right out while placing the nachos on our table so there are some timing issues to be worked out.  The individual with the enchiladas said they were pretty good minus the steak being thrown on top instead of actually being inside the enchiladas themselves.  The chili verde burrito I ordered turned out to be a large white rice burrito with a little bit of meat and chili verde sauce, and lastly the chicken breast entree was pointed out to be the same thin pre-cooked chicken breasts we had picked up in the frozen section at the grocery store for some quick meals at work.  Overall I'd say the food was mediocre at best, the constant barrage of people approaching the table including the waitress not being attentive to a group of three this place was pretty much a bust.  The final hit for the place that was surprising was automatic gratuity for a group of three people!    I recommend trying another Mexican restaurant before wasting your money here unless you're going for the music/loud environment."}
{"text":"Drinks are great, food is average at best. Been here a few times, each time seems to be a different experience as far as customer service."}
{"text":"I took the girlfriend there last night and walked into a beautiful restaurant even with the upstairs closed off. They seated us looking right at the fountains in the courtyard and so the ambience was exciting. However as others have mentioned, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't provide chips and salsa wouldn't be someplace I'd repeatedly go to. On a Wednesday night the place had barely 10 customers. Our waitress was training another girl. After ordering a \"Hawaiian\" drink that claimed to have silver tequila in it (which I could taste the cheapness) and was less than enjoyable. I ordered the lobster taco and was told by the waitress they don't serve that any longer. Really? Couldn't even sharpie it out on the menu? Then we ordered the stuffed tomitillos and they were beautiful but miniature and undercooked. After deciding on the the shrimp tacos for an entree my girlfriend ordered something that resembled a loaded quesodilla. Both were delicious. The bill came to 77 dollars which I thought was criminal. I'd go back but only on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and the service was good for not being busy. However I will not be back due to the infringement on my second amendment as they posted a no conceal carry sign on the door. To bad for the them. I will spread the word."}
{"text":"This is a time I needed to listen to that voice in my head. I should have known better when there is a hockey game and all the other restaurants have over an hour wait and you can walk into this place and get a table. The menu is limited. The food is sub par. If you are a taco joint you would think they would have a better selection of tacos. Nope not this place. The carne asada tacos I doubt are carne asada. It looked and tasted more like over cooked pot roast. The beans came from a can and the rice, well not sure where they got that stuff. This was the worst food ever. If you want tacos go somewhere other than this place."}
{"text":"Expensive. But the guacamole and the margaritas were definitely worth it. Our server was sweet and not too overbearing when we just asked for chips and guac and lots of drinks. I got the original margarita and it was strong and VERY good. Four stars only for the price and that it took them a while to notice us at the front."}
{"text":"I went here thinking it was an authentic Mexican restaurant but I was disappointed. The food  menu is very limited. They only had three kinds of tacos. I had the coconut shrimp tacos. The combination just didn't work. The margarita my husband ordered was not that tasty either. Service wise, the waiter was very attentive and the food was served rather fast. The two stars are for the food."}
{"text":"Convenient location if you're in the west gate entertainment area. The food is okay--our group went on taco night, but I had a salad. The food was good but nothing spectacular. Our appetizer mini-chimichangas were a miss. Salsa and guacamole were good. Our service was spotty and it wasn't that busy.  All in all, I would not go out of my way to try this restaurant but it's not terrible"}
{"text":"So great! We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the weather with some tacos and the taco salad. The potato tacos are some of the best I've had and the taco salad was very large. It was all excellent we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was before a Sunday Night Football Game and I had set my expectations low as every bar in the area had over a hour 30 min wait! Salt was able to sit my party of eight within 20 min and we received great service. They told us going in that food was taking about 30 minutes from when you order it so I enjoyed their honestly. Drinks kept flowing and our server checked back often. It's a very energetic atmosphere with two levels so don't come here if you don't like the noise or the crowds! My table ordered the guac, salsa and cheese dip as an appetizer that came out first with tri colored chips. My bf and I split the carne asada nachos (SO MUCH FOOD) and could barely finish- I recommend like 4 people to finish these bad boys! Others at our table ate the chicken quesadilla or carne burritos and said everything was amazing. I'd definitely come back! I noticed a few reserved tables, even on a game day, so it might be worth looking into..."}
{"text":"Well, this is a hidden Mexican food gem over at Westgate.  I love eating fresh food whenever possible and when the avocado is fresh and clearly not squeezed out of a container then its a winner for me!  I loooove avocado.  Being from South Texas and growing up near the Mexican border I know a thing or two about Mexican cuisine.  This place was not bad at all.  I have high expectations. Teehee.... This place is good at best and the waitress was stellar.  Very attentive and didn't have a problem handling a large table of 10!  Must Try!  I didn't take photos of my food.  Oops! Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Place has great tacos! The weekend night life on Friday and Saturday (after 10pm) is absolutely amazing and so much fun! The Dj is pretty damn good at his job, the place is very lively, lots of dancing on the dance floor! They have bottle service, and when the girls bring it out it's quite a show! They also have very cheap bottle service on Tuesday nights too for their taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"stopped in to try some place new. Horrible service. Hostesses were nice and friendly, sat promptly.Waiter sucked....took forever to order a beer, didn't know happy hour special, didn't know ingredients for the menu. Ordered chips and salsa and guacamole. took 15 minutes to get. He stopped by to let me know that he was waiting on the kitchen to cook the guacamole. After waiting an additional 10 minutes, waiting to order a 2nd beer, he finally.came by. after another 5 to 10 minutes came by to let me know he was waiting on the bar for the beer maybe something is wrong with the keg he said. Time to go, not interested in ordering food. waiting another 15 minutes to try and pay our bill. The manager finally walked by and asked if everything was ok. She didn't know their specials either. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Tequila selection, Bueno! Atmosphere, Bueno! Food, no Bueno. Seriously, subpar at best. Worth it for the tequila however if you like a good variety."}
{"text":"OMG, what a great place and what a great event. Little did the gang of Elites know that in addition to our event there would be a hockey game, a biker event and St. Patricks Day events going on at the same place. And you know what, it did not matter one bit, everyone from all the events had a great time celebrating whatever it was that they were there for. Our event was fantastic. The food was plentiful and great tasting. Our servers were friendly and fast, the owner/manager took amazing care of the 30 or so Elites that were, as usual, being a loud and rowdy bunch. Once the drinks were ordered there was delivered a plate of nachos that was on initial view a thing of beauty. It was hard to dig into it as it looked so good, but once it was breached, our hungry group savored every bite. We then ordered from a menu, I had the cheese enchilada. It was one of the best I have ever eaten, and eat it I did, even though I was quite full. I could just not stand to see that delight sit there uneaten. Everyone to an Elite was  happy, happy, happy.  We then waddled our full stomachs over to the PopBar. A place like I have never seen and it is hard to describe, but it can be understood with a picture and a few words. The picture is below, the words are, you choose what bar of ice cream, gelato or sorbet you want (and there are loads of yummy choices), then it goes to an area with   about 20 different things to roll or coat the bar in, you name it, they got it. I real delight....the whole evening was a real delight.  Thanks Hailey !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had the carve asada tacos that were delicious. The meat was super flavorful and juicy. We asked the manager why they didn't have chips and salsa as a standard that you get and he brought us out four different kinds of salsa to try. They were all delicious! I would definitely pay for these salsas as a starter. He was super friendly and described all of the salsas to us as we tried them. You could tell he was very passionate about what he does. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food was bland and mediocre. The service was OK and the music was alright. They probably make their money off of drinks. The food would be better if I were drinking."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food. It is in the westgate entertainment district which is a fun area to visit. Their happy hour is 3-7pm and a pretty good deal with half off selected appetizers (which is most of them) and some money off of alcoholic drinks (including margaritas and sangria.) Service was good. Many vegetarian options available without the price of a meat entree!  For an appetizer we got the loaded fries which was a lot of food! Definitely order for 3-5 people not 2 people unless it's your meal. For an entree I got the enchilada with red sauce which came with a side of rice and refried beans."}
{"text":"Came here to pregame and celebrate my daughter's birthday before heading to University of Phoenix arena for the Taylor Swift concert. Apparently our party of 8 got here just in time to beat the crowd and we're luckily seated immediately. Throughout our entire meal there was an extremely long line out the door.   Considering it was 105 degrees outside, I really wish they had closed the doors and windows surrounding the perimeter of the restaurant.  Their outdoor patios have misters and I'm convinced the people out on the patio were better off than those of us inside because what little air conditioning they had was just blowing out with all the open doors and windows.   Our server was very nice, but unfortunately our food took a long time to arrive. At least we weren't in a hurry. The good news is the food and drinks were both delicious!! I had the carnitas chimichanga and had a Speedy Gonzales cranberry drink. Also had the Blue Hawaiian margarita and tried my husband's Speedy Gonzales blueberry cocktail. All were yummy. They had a tequila rep there who came by our table as well and offered us all free shots of the tequila he was promoting. It was very smooth and quite good. If this review were based off of food and drink taste alone, I would have given it a five. Honestly, I would have given the overall experience a four, but deducted an extra star (wish we could do half stars!) because I made the mistake of leaving my credit card there. I realized it once we were at the concert and tried to call the restaurant several times over many hours but they never answered the phone. I ended up having to cancel it when it would have been easier to just swing by and pick it up."}
{"text":"We took our sons and their wives for lunch today. I had read over reviews and thought we should go elsewhere. Glad we didn't. It was Sunday around 12:30. We were seated the moment we walked in. Hostess was polite and chatty (which we all love!) our waitress arrived at our table in about 2 minutes after we seated, and took drink orders. Drinks came out within about 4 minutes. So far..so good! She came back after about 5 minutes and took our appetizer order and food order (at our request). Appetizer was out in about 7-8 minutes and about 5 minutes after we were finished with it, our food came out. Food was pretty good, shrimp could have been just a tad warmer but it was still all good food. A big burley, nice guy (manager or owner I am assuming) came by and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything, and about 5-6 minutes after that, a younger gentleman with his hair pulled back came and checked to see if we were doing alright. Our waitress was very attentive, and met all of our requests in a really timely manner (we were sure to leave a great tip). As we were leaving the manager(?) that had checked on us previous met us by the door to ask how our visit was. We chatted for a few minutes. Super nice guy. For sure we will go back again, and hopefully always have such good service and food."}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday lunch for taco Tuesday. We were greeted immediately by our server, Cody. He was very friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. I ordered 3 tacos- a veggie, a potato and a fish taco. They were all delicious!! Our food came out very quick. The manager, Steve, even stopped by to make sure everything was great. He seemed very nice and friendly too. We will definitely be back! Great customer service! Good job!!"}
{"text":"Went twice...burritos and enchiladas. Both were mediocre at best. The staff is friendly and nice, just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. The service is great. I prefer Cantina Laredo over Salt when it comes to food. The portions are bigger and the steak fajitas are better than at Salt. I'd definitely go back to Salt again though. Their drink specials are great"}
{"text":"Great drinks. Great service! Crystal was awesome, super attentive. Will definitely be back because of such great service."}
{"text":"Kicked us out for dancing after a football game. What a terrible place to go at westgate."}
{"text":"I really like it here last time I came I saw Kevin federline! But anyway the menu isn't the biggest and the workers are not the nicest but I like the atmosphere and the options on the menu. I wouldn't say it's too expensive but the food is great so it's worth anyway overall pretty great - good job!"}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend and had an amazing time! I was craving Mexican food and this place sure did hit the spot! I had Chelsea as my waitress and she was so so sweet and patient. I'll definitely going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! Everything from the food to the entertainment, I must say I have never had a dull moment when I went to Salt.   The coolest part about Salt to me is depending on what time you go you always receive a different type of experience. If you want to go for lunch because you work in the area, it is great to grab a bite to eat. I was greeted by one of the sweet hostess that are at the front and was sat immediately. The restaurant was clean, which I know is something people look at when they are trying somewhere new. Surprisingly enough I was \"table touched\" by both the manager and the owner. I felt so welcomed here that I now go back all the time.   They also on some night have celebrity DJ's that will spin there. Not exactly time for the family but these event usually happen later at night. Other then that a completely awesome family restaurant to bring your kids and enjoy the huge fountain in the middle of West gate.   I was just so impressed with everything this place have to offer. it was one of the first places i tired when i moved to Arizona and I wasn't disappointed. The staff here is incredible."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks. Came here for Cinco de Mayo. Servers were friendly and attentive. Muy bien!!"}
{"text":"If there was zero star option I would chose it the waiter brought us our appitizer chips and salsa they came very stale and cold, as were eating them we notice something on a few chips it was cold nacho cheese as if they threw old chips in our basket we sent them back and yold the waiter never mind we don't want them anymore he just says sorry about that the cups were dirty the rice and beans were cold the tortillas were cold the meat had zero flavor it was the worst experience Ive ever had at a restaurant. Never again will I go back there!"}
{"text":"This is almost to comical to post. But here we go. Visiting family from out of town, we head to west gate. Which is the nightlife area in Glendale. We head to salt to have our  first beer. Wednesday night, dead bar. Bartender greets us and walks away and then she went missing in action. 2 bartenders by the way. I sat at the bar for about 10 minutes with neither bartender asking me what I was drinking. They were literally to busy gossiping about nonsense. Horrible service and amateur hour to say the least. Step your game up salt. Or just fire the 2 clown bartenders you had working."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I absolutely adored it. I am vegan and they made the veggie fajitas for me they were wonderful. Unfortunately I didn't take a picture. I would highly recommend the house margarita it is strong but not too strong.           It is just right! The taco salad is huge i would recommend splitting it! We had chips salsa and Guacamole. Guacamole was fresh and perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was all excited about taco Tuesday and the price$1, $2 and $3 tacos $5 margaritas. The tacos I had the fish, shrimp and carne asada were ok nothing really to make me come back and I honestly didn't care for the potato and ground beef which explains why they are only 1.00. One other note I would like to mention is that a 32 oz draft beer was 10.50 who the hell pats that much for a draft beer is nuts. Needless to say I don't think I will be going back just another restaurant to scratch off my list of places to try."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Happy hour is awesome....my fiancé and I can have a few drinks and some apps for under $30. I love their margaritas, chips and tacos. Everything tastes good and is very unique. Not your standard meat with cheese on a tortilla. The patio is awesome to sit outside and watch everything going on at Westgate. Haven't been here at night so can't review the nightlife but I bet its a fun place."}
{"text":"Update: They saw my review as soon as it was posted and tried to make it right. It worked a little. I'm giving them 2 additional stars. 1 star for trying even though it was only because of my yelp review....and the waitress seemed apologetic. The second star is for taking around 80$ off our bill.  I plan to move to this area from California, so I'd  consider giving this place another chance.   OLD REVIEW: Paid for V.I.P for the night and not once did we get any extra drinks we asked for (we would have paid extra for them), but was told once our bottle is gone they were going to make us get up so they can resale the booth?  Seriously? Our waitress was nice but slow to come back after asking for multiple drinks from 3 different people.    Birthday girl goes to the bartender to let her know what happens and she calls for security saying bday girl gave attitude? So they kick the bday girl out for explaining what happened.   Bday girl did get to come back in but not after being  blamed for some unknown person throwing up in our booth? Although it wasn't anyone in our party and our waitress confirmed it with security.   This place is hella weird. I'm not from out here but they ruined my sis in law Bday, she cried because she was genuinely trying to have fun and they made her sit outside for 30 min wondering if she could rerurn to our shit V.I.P table. ...over explaining our situation about our lack of service.   As I write this we got a drink finally. Lol. The waitress actually felt bad for us and how we were treated. I thank her, but the bouncer was rude and spoke to us in a disrespectful tone."}
{"text":"The nachos with chorizo was AMAZING!!! Loved it and we had three people and weren't able to finish it. My boyfriend got the Guinness and said it was flat. We then got burritos which were decent. I wasn't impressed by it but the beans and rice were awesome! Overall pretty good !"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!  Came for \"Sunday Funday\", left feeling sick and disguisted. No games as advertised or even a reasonable size menu for their \"brunch\". The fruit that was brought to my 4 year old son was rotten! When I mentioned this to our waitress, I was told, \"that cant be possible, we cut our fruit only on sundays when its the brunch menu and I smelled the watermelon and it was fine.\" Ok, I said, well it was the green melon not the watermelon and could it be possible that your cooks cut up a rotten melon? She stated, \"Well, I dont eat melon so I dont know what its supposed to smell or taste like.\" Really.......good lord! First of all dont argue with your customers and second of all, apologize, get a manager and ask how you can help, not antagonize us! I still gave one star because the music playing, which was the only thing true to their advertisement, was great as well as their french toast. But never again will I or my friends and family go again and trust me, Ive already mentioned this to plenty of people."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for an early dinner before catching a movie. We had a Groupon that was getting ready to expire and unfortunately they will not accept them when there is a hockey game going on and that seems to be the only time we are ever at Westgate. We sat on the patio and the weather was great. It was fun to people watch while waiting for our food. We started off with an appetizer of Ceviche. It was very tasty although it seemed to be a little light on the actual shrimp with the veggies and the broth composing most of it. I did love the half of avocado that was served atop of it - much better than dicing it into chunks inside of it like a lot of places do. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast with Grilled Pineapple and Onions. It came with a side of black beans and rice. I requested to substitute grilled vegetables for the rice and they happily obliged. The chicken breast was very tender and had a fantastic flavor. The grilled vegetables had some sort of sauce or marinade on them that appeared very oily and totally negated the reason I had requested them over the rice (a healthier option) and I was saddened  that I couldn't eat them. Hubby had the Chicken Enchiladas and he said they were good. The timing of receiving our entrees could have been better as we received them not long after our appetizer so we didn't even have time to finish our appetizer. Our server was nice and no complaints in that department."}
{"text":"Came here with some work friends and had a good meal. It's in a cool area right near the stadium with all a lot of options.   We had various things and all of the portions were really big.  I had the build the bowl which was a really cool option.  The carnitas in my bowl had good flavor and would like to try something different if I am ever back in the area.  Everyone seemed to like their food.  Salads, Burritos, build a bowl and tacos were among the things we ordered.    Service was good.  Not over the top but just solid.  We sat outside and it was nice to enjoy a beautiful night in Arizona.    Good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered their cheese enchiladas and it was nasty. I wished my husband and I would have gone some place else to have dinner. The server did not seem happy to be there. Also, the floor was nasty; my shoes stuck to it and was sticky the remainder of my evening."}
{"text":"Came in for drinks, ordered 3 beers and a water they were out of the first 2 beers we ordered early on a Friday night we finished our first round and would have ordered a second but server never came back around got tired of waiting went to bar to cash out told 3 people at bar but nobody knew who my server was !! will never return"}
{"text":"Had 3 drinks and then was cut off for no reason. I am assuming this place doesn't like people to have fun. If you're looking for a good time do not go here"}
{"text":"Friends in town at Westgate they wanted to try here for Mexican food I suggested someplace else, everyone disappointed with the service, food and the high cost ...seems like they already raised prices ...Stay away"}
{"text":"I went to salt on 5/13 around 8pm at night. The restaurant was quite crowded and the music was very loud. First off, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit outside. My family and I said \"no\" because it was 90 degrees out and we were still adjusting to the heat. After saying so the hostess rolled her eyes and sat us at a table. From there our waitress/bartender Cara came to the table. She recommended the margaritas and various appetizers. My family and I were not very hungry so we ordered the ceviche and drinks. Let's just say the ceviche was not very good. It was fresh but lacked acidity and spice. After we ate the ceviche our waitress told us about the late happy hour. She said she would give us a happy hour menu but failed to show up again. We left minutes later. On top of that, there was a gentlemen working in the bathroom handing out soap and asking for tips. This was NOT a five star restaurant people.  Cara was friendly but very inattentive. I would give Salt a 1 star but there was plenty of T&A and sports on TV to keep you entertained. In saying so I give Salt 2 stars. Lots of eye candy, bad wait staff, loud music (terrible DJ), below average food, creeper working the bathroom, and high prices. Total tourist trap."}
{"text":"This was a bit of a wild card for us! It was a last minute decision and I didn't expect it to be as good as it was!  We stopped in later in the evening during the week since we had some houseguests staying with us. We were greeted and seated right away which I always appreciate. The only downside to this night was that they had all of the doors open and it was pretty chilly but I want deduct points for this as I'm a wuss and always cold.  We all ordered a margarita while we chose our menu entree. The house margarita was actually pretty darn good! I couldn't complain at all with this choice! For dinner I got the enchiladas, which is always my go to. While our dinner was being prepared, our waitress, even thought it was busy, was sure to keep checking on us refilling drinks as needed.   Finally our food arrived and I was honestly blown away. The presentation was beautiful and I was ready to dive in! I cannot lie, I didn't expect much as this wasn't your traditional Mexican restaurant but the flavor was phenomenal!! It was one of those \"I know I should stop eating but can't\" moments.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Manager brought out Logan a free corn dog and the tacos were great. I'd go with the Turmeric chicken my wife got but crunchy fish was good as well. We'll be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Happened to be in Glendale at the outlet mall and decided to try this place for lunch!  So happy we did....turns out that it's Taco Tuesday, and they have $1, $2, and $3 street tacos, based on ingredients!!  I had 2 of the ground beef ($1ea) and 2 of the carnita ($2ea).  Both were out of this world!   Service was excellent and very prompt!  Highly recommend this place, and we will definitely be back.....probably next Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and the food was very good and service was great. Tonight, however, that went out the window. We got there and our server seemed friendly yet distracted. We ordered our drinks which were good. We then ordered our appetizer and entrees. We ordered ceviche as our appetizer so it should have come quickly. Instead, my wifes entree came and they asked if there would be anything else. After explaining what we didn't get, the man walked away looking confused. A few minutes later the server came and said they were just waiting on shells for my tacos. Nothing was said about the app, so I told him to just cancel it. Server was very standoffish after that, never apologized or anything for the inconvenience. Mistakes happen and Im a great tipper, but I left nothing. An apology would have went a long way! We wont be back."}
{"text":"Not sure why SALT has so many bad reviews. I was in town for the Fiesta Bowl and they hosted a Clemson game day party. The service was good and really quick for how busy they were. The food was also really quick and drinks were cold. Staff was really friendly.  Their house margarita could use some work, only thing I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Omg had a margarita that had to be PURE tequila. Had them remake it STILL pure tequila. Ahhh!!!! And it's hard to get a waitress to notice you! We sat no joke at a table virtually in the middle of the restaurant and I feel like the waitresses didn't want to acknowledge us or something. We finally caught the attention of a really nice waitress but it was a struggle to get anyones head to turn our direction. It's sad cause I really want to like this place."}
{"text":"Seated quickly, swerved quickly. Good was delicious but beer selection was a bit lacking. Very happy with the service as I came in with a group of seven, all with separate checks. Waitress didn't get confused at all and other employees were quick to help out too."}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night with a big party for my brothers going away celebration. The carne asada tacos were not my cup of tea. The meat was cut into huge chunks that took me a while to chew through. The seasoning was SUPER sweet - not something I'm used to for carne asada. The wait staff were pretty slow. It wasn't very busy and we could see them standing around talking and it was hard to wave them down when we needed something. The beans and Spanish rice were bomb though. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went here earlier in the week after attending a concert at University of Phoenix stadium. It's so convenient to be able to walk over here after all the events nearby. The music was awesome and the atmosphere is really nice overall. They have a good selection for margaritas. I tried the Blue Hawaiian margarita and it was delicious. I ordered the nachos, and the portion was huge. I noticed they had a half size option but didn't realize how huge it really would be! They don't seem to have consistent closing times however, as they rushed to close out the tab pretty much as soon as we ordered and I have been in Westgate and they weren't even open."}
{"text":"Came for St Patrick's day last week for drinks and had a good time ,staff was friendly , came back today for dinner and was not inpressed , the quacamole was good and that's about it , had chicken tacos and they were very bland I mean no taste ,also had the enchiladas and just a mess with no taste , beans and rice typical , waiter was nice , I'd come back for a drink but definitely not to eat"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game! Service was awesome and the manager switched chanel so we could see our game-he offered"}
{"text":"Came in asked to sit by the bar.  No seats so my group went outside and sat on a community table, then I was told I could not sit here because I had to get someone to sit me by the waitress.  I went up front asked to sit where I was just at, which was available, went back to the table with menus this time and surprisingly got the same waitress who just told me that I could not sit here.  LAME and stupid.  She gave me a lame excuse that people just come and sit anywhere ... well if you want money they should be able to sit where they want right???   Almost left because of her, but stayed and had an okay time.   Customer Friendly no-  I been to places where the people say that it's okay I sit here and THEY BRING YOU THE MENUS, not where you have to go to host to get permission where you just sat and for them to bring you the menus.  It's just lame.  I don't care if this place makes because with this experience they should sink."}
{"text":"In comparison to the food replacement of Margaritaville, higher quality food by far! Excellent chicken, very fresh! They could bring out chips that are made in the kitchen instead of bagged chips but the salsa was excellent. Management should check the ladies room...Two out of order stalls, broken soap and hand dryer, no seat covers in any of the stalls and broken door locks. YIKES. FOOD excellent, Service, perfect!"}
{"text":"We ran here to escape the rain for the beerfest.  Quickly seated next to an outdoor heater as we requested.  Service was spot on.  Our friends ordered the nachos app.  The most enormous plate of food I think I've ever seen.  Tasty too.  The hit of the night was the tamales.  I've had homemade tamales and these were unbelievable.  Perfectly cooked with the masa not the highlight but just a perfect partner to the meat.  Honestly surprised at how good this was. Restaurant tamales aren't usually this good.  A shitty beerfest was rescued by a fantastic evening here.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place was great fun after the Cardinals practice. I'm not sure what it's like everyday, but we came when there was an event for #birdgang going on. There was a dj and prizes being given away. It was a fun atmosphere and the food was pretty good. Prices weren't too bad either. We sat at the bar and our bartender was nice. Seemed like it was going to be hard to get a table. Choose the bar, it's more fun that way!"}
{"text":"Saturday I went with my family and ordered the tacos the portions were a good size and the food was delicious!!!!! Will be returning again!!!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The Legendary Potato Tacos: This is def the hottest item on the menu. When I say legendary, don't question. Just order them. Made to order, so always fresh. Shout out to the staff. They always accommodate my party and make us feel welcome. #TacoTuesday #Bet"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday pre-Cardinals game.  This placed was decked out for Seahawks fans with giant signs welcoming them, and all the staff dressed in Seahawks gear.  WTH!  Should they not support the home teams?  Especially since the stadium's right next door.  This place is all about the money, not the home team spirit.  And the games were on tv with no volume, but they were playing loud music instead. I will never come here again.  Had a drink and left and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here for my 21st birthday today and when I got there I was told my first drink and a dessert would be on the house. I was not expecting that at all and had no idea. How cool of Salt to do that! Anyways, the margarita was great and packed a punch. Everyone also enjoyed their meals. Thanks Salt!"}
{"text":"Bottomline: It is the equivalent of ballpark hotdog - overpriced and underwhelming.   We had dinner before a big show. I had the cheese quesadillas and my GF had a taco plate. Three things stuck out from the experience:   1) Quality of food. To be blunt, I've had cafeteria food that was more appetizing. If anything stood out on my plate, it was the browning lettuce strips on the side. The quesadillas were underwhelming. The sour cream was ok but runny, and it filled only a 1/4 of the tiny plastic cup. The taco plate had three small tacos with two big cups of rice and beans obviously designed to fill you up.  2) Service. The waitress was nice but apparently unprepared. She couldn't recall the seasonal beers on tap. We had to ask her to bring us several things after the meal was delivered: 1) water, 2) salsa for the meal, and 3) extra sour cream.  3)  Menu. Here I was mystified as there were not a lot of distinct choices. I appreciate reducing costs and having a simple menu, but many of the dishes stated they had rice and beens in them, which also happens to also accompany the dish!"}
{"text":"NO STARS!  The Manager, yes I said MANAGER tried to rip us off by 19 bucks!  We were using a gift card ($25) plus cash.  He pocketed the cash (15 dollars), ran the card for the full amount but told us there was only 20 bucks on there.  Then gave us a new bill showing we still owed 15 bucks!!!  Luckily I checked the gift card balance on my phone before we left. He took the remaining 5 from the gift card  He's a smarmy guy.  He had such a bad attitude and threw money from his wallet back on our table!!  Won't be back.  Buyer be Ware!!!  Not to mention the food and service was mediocre at best!!"}
{"text":"I did not care for this restaurant. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were nothing like chicken enchiladas. It's fine if they want to put their own spin on the dish, but when you completely change what people are expecting, you should rename it. This was a tortilla or two smothered in cheap cheese with a tad bit of sauce (not even enchilada sauce) with large chunks of chicken on top. It comes with a bowl of refried beans and some bland rice. It was the most boring meal in recent memory. No chips or salsa was served. No garnishes like fresh cilantro or maybe a lime wedge. It lacked any sort of culinary imagination. The service was no better. I asked the server for a couple more minutes, she came back 15 minutes later. Very disappointed by this place. I would not recommend it based on my single experience."}
{"text":"I am in town attending a convention and walked over to check things out. Upon entry Lila greeted me and agreed to let me see a menu. I was seated promptly and Lila was my server. I told her this was my first time and she walked me through everything. I know I am pretty particular. I decided try the chips and salsa with queso fundido as an appetizer. For my entree I had the enchiladas with chicken adobo(seasoned perfectly) and I added shrimp. I opted to go with the green sauce (which was a bit too full of lime for me). Nevertheless I ate most of it. I also used a Groupon which the manager had to redeem. He was great as well, made sure everything was great. If I ever visit again, I will definitely stop in, next time during happy hour."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food/presentation. Excellent server she said she was new, very attentive. Husband had the tamales. Said best he's ever had or at least second best. I had salad and the shredded beef tacos. SO GOOD!!! The avacado vinagrette dressing was delicious. Had leftovers next day and used that same dressing on some taquitos my husband ate.  Stayed for dancing which didn't start till around 10. One worker after moving tables barely swept floor, super lazy. I guess a fall and injury on food and napkin pieces would change that. Where's management? DJ was really good though."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place sucks. If i could give negative stars I would. Quick to seat u but I think it's only to get u out. Took almost 30 min to get food which isn't too unusual but I ordered just tacos. My drink tasted Water down so I had to order beer instead to even it out. That wasn't until I waited another 30 min for my beer. Mind u I had my food sitting in front of me the whole time so by the time I got to my food it was cold. I would never come here again nor would I recommend it to any one. Mind u in writing this evaluation while waiting for the waitress to achnknowledge my existence as a table. Bottom line crappy service, food was below par and drinks suck unless u get beer. Horibble place if u can avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Fantastic! With all the places to choose from in this complex, Salt is now my favorite. Spent a weekend next door at the Renaissance for @ the 4th time and our experience at Salt was our best of the weekend. Hostess were friendly and Ali greeted us promptly. She first asked for our drink orders and when we told her we had 30 minutes to leave for the airport, she was on it. AND, she was the sweetest young lady, besides a great server.  Loved the menu choices (& I'm not a fan of Mexican). Wish I didn't have to drive right away so I could've tried their margaritas. Next time. Spoke with Brent, the manager - great guy, grateful for our patronage. The food was fantastic. Their dip with their quesadillas was different and delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First off, this place is WAY better than the other \"mexican\" place in Westgate. Our server was AWESOME and the food was very good! We loved the atmosphere there as well. Yes, it's a little overpriced but honestly, most of the places at Westgate are. We plan on going back one evening to kick back and enjoy!  **There's two different address listed on Yelp for the same location, so I'm leaving the same review for both!"}
{"text":"Over expensive. Staff is nice but they don't inform you on drink prices, so you end up paying a bunch more than you would anywhere else. When I had an issue with the fact that our bartender never told us our drinks were 10 dollars a piece all the manager did was wave one of my beers. Which was nice but over all you can get cheaper drinks in a lot of better places"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after a long day at work and was not disappointed. The service was very good the minute I walked in I was acknowledged and walked to a table by karissa who ended up also being my server. She was extremely kind and had no problems answering my questions upon her recommendation I had the Carne Asada tacos. They were very good I found the sweet taste rather interesting couldn't quite figure out what it was however a nice touch. Karissa came by the table several times to make sure I was ok and was not pushy which tends to happen way to often at restaurants. I was also checked on by what seemed to be a manager which was refreshing to see a manager making table rounds unfortunately I did not catch his name. The atmosphere in this restaurant was wonderful very relaxed which was much needed after a long day. For dessert I ordered the deep fried banana split which I have never heard of and it was amazing! A deep fried banana, three scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, fresh strawberry, slice of grilled pineapple, and caramel drizzle! Worth every calorie!! Needless to say I had a pleasant experience thanks Karissa!"}
{"text":"The food and service are fine but to be right next to University of Phoenix stadium... And support SEAHAWKS ONLY.....on game day, is a shame. We were there before the game and felt really uncomfortable and unwelcome due to rude Seahawks fans.  ** Sandbar is a fine example of doing it right. They have a Packers section but staff wear their favorite teams jerseys. Every team fan feels welcome."}
{"text":"I came here after the Mcgregor/Mayweather fight for a friends bday and another friends \"going away\" party. He had 2 VIP tables reserved. When we got there, it seemed like a fun place. Pretty spacious, the music was good, and all my friends were there. Well, as soon as the bottles came, they were gone since we had so many people in our section.  I resorted to getting my own drinks at the bar. My first issue was when my brother ordered 2 shots from the Asian girl at the bar on the second floor. As soon as she poured them and put them on the bar for us, my other friend quickly showed up and wanted a shot as well. I put my finger in the air and mouthed \"one more please\". She rolled her eyes, threw her arms up and mouthed \"really?!\".  We all looked at each other kind of shocked.  This was the first time EVER that I did not leave a tip.  Second issue was with the crowd that this bar/club attracts. A lot of \"westside thugs\". I know it's not the clubs fault but mix these type of guys with liquor and you'll have some problems. We were constantly \"mad dogged\" and shoved until my brother almost got into a fight with a really drunk up-to-no-good thug. This happened at the front patio. We were trying to get in between the 2 to prevent a fight. Security was nowhere to be found for assistance. Finally, we left at 2am. As we got to the parking lot, there was TONS of fights. I mean EVERYONE was fighting. Get bartenders with good/fun attitudes and make security more present INSIDE the bar and it would be better. For now, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Walked into this place to give it a chance despite the bad reviews but ended up walking away. Came with a group after a concert and ready to eat and drink but had to go elsewhere. This place has potential to draw in a good crowd but for some reason, they are failing in customer service all the way. No greetings at the door except to check your I.D. and no hostess to sit you or take your order. Ended walking away after 15m of no service. Hope management can figure it out."}
{"text":"Came in today because I was wandering around west gate with a friend trying to figure out where to eat. I'm a sucker for taco Tuesday so I decided to try this place out. $1, $2, and $3 street tacos, a pretty good steal when they're normally $14 for three tacos (ridiculous and would never pay that much). Anyways, I got the veggie, Barbacoa, and Baja fish tacos. Veggie was weird, it had broccoli and cauliflower in it? No flavor, glad it was only the $1 taco. Fish was cod, not a bad taco but it was cold so wasn't good either. The barbacoa one was good. The meat was flavorful and the sauce mixed well with it. Wish I would've gotten three of those.  Overall, would come back if I'm desperate for a $1 taco but I think I can find much much much better tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Its spring training weekend and we came to this location for happy hour.  Tyler our waiter, exceeded himself with his charismatic personality  and great customer service.  He kepted up with our drink reguest service and brought out our food promptly.  We leave Salt being happy customers.. Thanks Tyler!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 1/5 Happiness - 3/5  It's just tough to find anywhere exciting to eat around the Cardinals and Coyotes stadium (assuming you have a stomach left for food after watching these teams play ;-) Go Yankees and Carolina Panthers!). In any event, Salt Tacos certainly didn't live up to even my low expectations.   My mood was first soured when I had to pay a cover that was almost as expensive as the parking itself. The bar is huge, but woefully understaffed. The one positive is that you can get a great giant mug of beer... but it certainly isn't a deal to do so. But the biggest sin is that we live in Arizona - arguably the US capital for great Mexican food - and everything here tasted so bland. It wasn't bad, but it just had no taste (and probably maintained all of the carbs/fat/calories). The portions were generous, but you can find big portions and high quality all over the State. I'd definitely go anywhere else than here."}
{"text":"The menu was SO LIMITED and not what they had online.  The fish in the tacos I had was cold and mushy and the dish sat way to long before it came to the table that the tortillas disintegrated when I picked it up to eat them.  I will say that when I mentioned that the tacos were soggy they quickly made a couple more and brought them out, but that didn't make up for the fact that they were unsatisfactory to begin with.  My drink didn't come until I reminded someone else that I had ordered it about 20 minutes ago.  All in all it was just OK, but disappointing nevertheless.  For as much as the meal cost we certainly didn't feel it was worth the money."}
{"text":"The customer experience card offered by the management has a small,  two-inch long space for comments, so I figure one word can sum up this place:  OVERPRICED.  The food is OK, but not great.  The best thing about this place is the location and setting, right in the heart of the Glendale sports and restaurant complex near the large fountain.  Several patio tables let you enjoy the place.  So if you're out for a casual drink and don't mind spending more money than you should, Salt is a viable choice.  Figure that you're paying for the location, not the food."}
{"text":"Half price appetizers until 7! The nachos were insanely HUGE! Our waitress was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great service and great food!  The atmosphere is perfect!   We had Margaritas and tacos and both were delicious!  Totally recommend this stop at westgate"}
{"text":"Fish, shrimp and carne asada were on point! Right flavor combos and friendly service , highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner multiple times and it's always so good. Really great staff and good vibes. They have a few unique foods that I reeeally like, esp the potato tacos (sounds weird but they're bomb). I also love their mini chimis, they're an appetizer but it's perfect dinner size imo.  But last time I came with bae we discovered the fried ice cream, which tops everything else. It's peeerfectly crunchy, creamy, sweet, savory and cinnamony. We MOPPED this dessert unlike any other dessert. Seriously, it's so good that I plan on coming back to order it when I'm having a bad day because I know it'd cheer me up even more than my DOG. The power of delicious food is unstoppable. Go you, Salt.  --- I'm separating this part because I want to note that my review is based solely on the stellar meals at Salt, not nightlife. I like to party at Westgate but I honestly never go to Salt late at night because the DJ isn't great, dudes are pushy, and nobody dances. 1 star nightlife, 5 star day time tho!"}
{"text":"I came in today for happy hour and had 3 different tacos and a house margarita. The Santa Fe Chicken, Carne Asada, & Chipotle Shrip tacos are AMAZING! The house margarita wasn't too sweet, it was perfect. Service was great too. Our server checked on us multiple times and drinks were brought out quick. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't write a review about the food since we were never served. We we seated after waiting only a few minutes.The dining room only had a few tables with customers, it wasn't busy at all. After about 5 minutes waitress number 1 came and asked if we'd been helped, took our drink order (diet pepsi, and iced tea with lemon), brought our drinks and told us waitress number 2 would be taking care of us. We waited, waited, and waited. Waitress number 1 walked by a few times, but wouldn't make eye contact.. The guy that seated us walked by, but wouldn't look our way. multiple others did the same. After waiting 15 more minutes, we got up and left, 20 minutes after being seated. We probably won't be going back, because no matter how good the food is, if no one is there to take your order, you won't get to eat."}
{"text":"Yet another reincarnation of Margaritaville, Salt seeks to deliver an upbeat nightlife scene with flair that can compete with Westgate's mainstays.   I like what they've done with the environment, as there's quite a bit of seating (albeit outoors), but the dance floor is still full. The lighting is dark enough and the music is loud enough to feel like a nice nightclub, but not so overboard you can't sit down and socialize with a small group. Having lots of space makes that easier.   The beer selection is average, and for $12 you can get a *gigantic* brew, which will save you a trip.   I just wonder when it'll live up to its full potential. As far as I could tell, the second floor wasn't being utilized at all. It would be really cool, and offer a sort of lounge aspect other bars in the area don't, so what's the deal? Also it's incredibly difficult for the 2-3 bartenders in the general population area to keep up. I'm sure these are just hiccups and they'll continue to offer a good experience, it's just that coming here was more vanilla than it should have been.   With regards to the food, I probably won't come here for that. Just please tell me the nachos have retained their awesomeness, because nothing else matters. =)"}
{"text":"Rating: - 1  Should have listened to Yelp!! This place was so bad I sent the Fried Ice Cream back. How do you ruin ice cream? Salt did. As for dinner, the Adobo Chicken was so dry and over cooked. Wish I would have sent that back. They could have recycled into an army boot sole. Items missing that were asked for in the Bowls. Service was very slow. But I blame that on management.  Our table of 7 had our food delivered one plate at a time."}
{"text":"We came to grab a quick bite to eat before the Coyotes hockey game. It was quick service and surprisingly delicious food!! We ordered the Green Chili Enchilada, Chicken Quesadilla, Chips & Salsa and the Half Nachos. I absolutely loved the enchilada and am already craving more. The Half Nachos ended up being a heaping plateful of nachos so we are curious as to how many people it would take to eat the Full Nachos. Luckily the 4 of us tackled the Half. Great food for great prices and fun ambiance! Will definitely come back for the future hockey games I come out for :)"}
{"text":"Great food and the have the BEST quality tequilas from Mexico, the manager Hugo is very nice and we loved the recommendations in tequilas, we now have a favorite restaurant Togo. You MUST try his place."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch or shopping pit stop.  Chain quality food and drinks. Warning the nachos serve about 6, not 1.  The crispy fish tacos came three to a plate.  They were ok, nothing bad or good just what I would expect from a mall restaurant.   If you are shopping and want lunch it's a good place to grab a bite.  If you are going on a date try spending a buck and go somewhere different."}
{"text":"The tacos and service were great! We had the fish tacos and Al Pastor tacos both were very good best Al pastor I ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm 3-staring this place. Tight tops and short jeans.  Ok. Food.  Menu simple. You can't screw it up. And they didn't.  I got carne asada tacos. Excellent. Washed it down with coors light(s).  Many.  Anyways I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mostly a fail in my opinion. Margaritas are delicious but very expensive, starting at $11 for a standard margarita glass. The food and service sucked, had to ask three times to get another drink, and the appetizers were greasy and plain out gross, couldn't finish all of them and didn't care to take them home - gross. Very very slow service. One person in the group stated the tacos tasted good. I'd find other options for happy hour if I were you."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town - this place was recommended- was very disappointing- not good Mexican food at alll\" -our party of 5 all had different items- paying for chips and salsa is joke first of all salsa had no flavor - chips were not fresh- on to drinks- all had different margaritas - two each. Very little a alcohol- Dinner carnitas burrito bland with burnt meat - ceded plank salmon- no seasoning- will not go back- do not recommend"}
{"text":"So I live in this area, but first time to Salt and decided to stop in for drinks and an appetizer on a slow Friday afternoon.  We were seated outside and the atmosphere is really nice.  However when the hostess seated us I mentioned that the table looked like it hadn't been cleaned off and she looked at me with a blank stare. So I grabbed a napkin and wiped it off myself.  So the waitress finally shows up and we all order house margaritas and chips/salsa. Margaritas were pretty good, but not much alcohol in them; chips weren't anything special- the red and blue corn kind right out of a Tostitos bag!  Salsa was bland and not much more than ground up tomatoes. To top it off, there's no A La Carte menu, so even if you'd like to try one taco, you're forced to order an entire meal.  But what makes my first impression here even worse was lack of service.  Waitress literally disappeared after dropping everything off. We sat there for over an hour and she never came back. We were one of only a few tables there. Had to beg her to get our bill!  So the 2 stars are for atmosphere, but zero stars for food/service."}
{"text":"Just not good. Service was great but the food was terrible. The bad thing is I didn't even expect much and it was still disappointing. Carne asada was dry overcooked and flavorless. The beans were not good and the rice was dry. There was no flavor to anything. Also the margarita was terrible and watered down."}
{"text":"Went in last Sunday for the game. Great customer service! I also really enjoyed the layout and the food is very good. The GM Steve asked us how everything was and as we began to talk we told him that it was our first time there. He really made it enjoyable. We will be back often! Heard that they have a great Taco Tuesday's as well."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Westgate often, but glad I got to experience this place. We decided to come here after a Spring training game. The restaurant was super accommodating. We had a large party and just showed up. They sat us right away, our server was the best (Tyler I think) and the manager stopped by a few times to check on us.   I always appreciate good service in a restaurant. And Salt certainly delivered. We did order some apps, however they didn't blow my mind. Which is the only reason they aren't getting 5 stars. But if you have never been, please check this place out. You will not be disappointed. I have been back since that first visit, and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Antes de Kick Off de los cardenales 2016, buen lugar, limpio trato bien, los tacos de camarón con chipotle buenos, servidos con arroz y frijoles, una limonada bien helada."}
{"text":"I do not understand why so many people gave this  place such low ratings.   I recently was visiting Arizona and wanted to try Mexican before leaving. We were near west gate and this was our only options and hesitant because of the reviews.   I think the salsa makes or breaks a Mexican joint! The salsa was flavorful with a minor kick to it. I personally enjoy spicier stuff, but understand not all people do therefore feel the salsa was pretty great.  In ordered the chicken tacos were great! I didn't need to add any salsa or hot sauce to them, usually a sign that I feel the food has no taste or a bad one.    Only downside was being not busy at all the waitress did not come by for long periods of times!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were good, chips and salsa good. Steve the GM and Cody the server were fantastic"}
{"text":"Average Mexican bar food. Average service. High prices. Stella Artois in a 32oz plastic cup? Really?  No need to come back here. I give them 6 months."}
{"text":"The hostess not that friendly. the menus smelled like a dirty used rag cleaned them. The blue Hawaiian margarita was excellent! The carnitas burrito chimmy style was excellent.  My guess is the hostess also cleans the menus."}
{"text":"Wow! What a difference a few weeks made with my experience. The management and staff were overly attentive and my server Shanie was awesome. Always smiling and appeared to love what she's doing.  Food was amazing. Full of flavor and, honestly, I couldn't eat it all because the portions were more than I could eat. While I didn't order dessert this time, I'm happy to be back. I'm not from this part of the country but will definitely make the effort next time I'm here to come back. Great job management and staff. Well done."}
{"text":"Stay away!!!!!! Was not happy at all with the level of service, especially with me being a fair girl. The wait to be seated was insane then waited over an hour for my food. When it finally came out it was cold! Sent it back and guess what.... It came out cold again! Manager comp'd the bill which is cool! Only issue is I was HUNGRY as hell and no one wanted cold chicken on their Nachos!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the guacamole & salsa appetizer.  Carne asada tacos were quite good, too.  Even enjoyed the side rice & beans.    Sorry, can't review drinks, didn't have any.  Good place for pre-game.  My 5 year is tugging on my arm and wants me to add the kids quesadilla & fries were excellent but there was a fly in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not great. I have been in for lunch tacos and margs and the service is slow and the food is okay but overpriced for what it is. A bunch of us went at night, and that seen was not for me at all. It is dance club-ish but in the cheap gross sort of way. Will not be going at night again. Ever."}
{"text":"If you are looking to sit around for an hour and cancel your order because it's taking too long this is the place to go.   So we go here on a Saturday night before a Coyotes game. I get it, most of the places in Westgate are going to be busy so we are expecting a wait time to sit and that the food will take awhile. This place though took incompetence to a new level. First of all their system of taking down your phone number and calling you when your table is ready is just an awful system. Can they not afford the pager system? While we were waiting we saw the host try and call numerous people and not talk to anyone. In addition we saw couples come after us and get seated right away while we were waiting. Maybe they were in line before and were being called back, sure didn't look like it though.   After waiting a decent amount of time the hostess comes up to us and says they can seat us right away but it would be with another couple. The game started at 7 and this was maybe 530 so at this point we just wanted to get seated. What an awkward position to put people in though. I thought maybe the table would a bigger table so it wouldn't be that weird. Nope, high top small table with 4 chairs. I mean we couldn't get this table to ourselves? We had to share with another couple? Really weird. Luckily the other couple ended up being really nice and we shared some nice conversations.   We put our order in as soon as we sat down, I'm thinking that we still have a pretty good shot of eating and getting out of there to get to the game at 7. Needless to say that did not occur. We waited and waited, our server, the poor girl reassured us that our food was coming out soon. She went to the back to check on it and she came out and said the kitchen was super backed up and they had some sort of big foul up. We ended up just canceling our order and paid for our drinks so we wouldn't miss the start of the game. Our service was really nice but where was the manager? No explanation or apology from management.   I get that its a busy night but you have to be prepared for it. Our server mentioned that a ton of people ended up canceling their orders as well. All in all a miserable dining and customer service experience."}
{"text":"Spent 12.50 on a mug of Shock Top. This bar got me looking around, because obviously I'm at the football stadium, or the beach."}
{"text":"They have really great food! My boyfriend and I had dinner here and I had the prickly pear margarita and the jalapeño margarita both were amazing. The habanero wasn't super spicy but had just enough kick to it for me. I got the Steak empanadas with rice and black beans very flavorful would definitely recommend and we also got the Portugal Tortes with refried beans definitely would recommend that as well. Everything on the menu sounds amazing!!! If you're looking for a great place to eat I would hit this spot up. If you like your sports they have plenty of TVs to watch all your sports. They have Happy Hour Mon-Fri from 3-6!! Would HIGHLY recommend this place for great food!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a ZERO! We waited over an hour and a half when they said 30 minutes! Then to top it off we had to go ask for the table we never got! We then decided to order from the bar and after waiting for 30 more minutes for our food they come and say it will be at LEAST another 20 minutes!!! No apologies from management or nothing!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. My food and drinks, lemons, salsa all came at different times super late. I asked to turn on the heater next to me and they all ignored me, yet they moved it to another table that asked for it right in front of me. I complained to manager and he claimed it was to change the gas tank and they clearly left it there, captain fucking obvious, this managers name was BRET, short weird white dude. Rude as fuck. I use to come here every Tuesday & bring my friends on weekend, I'll be making sure to not ever come back and make sure my friends and family don't either."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in after a long day at work and were pleasantly surprised that there was no wait (it was a Saturday around 6pm, usually West Gate is packed). We were seated quickly by a very friendly waiter, Michael. We ordered our food- guacamole and chips, taco salad and an enchilada style burrito. I was so excited to see how large the portions were! The food was great and the service remained excellent thought our dinner. The only thing that wasn't amazing was the sides that came with the burrito which were refried beans and Spanish rice. They were obviously packaged and lacked flavor. But this place still deserves a great rating because everything else was outstanding, especially the service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a quick \"hold me over\" lunch. We had their nachos plate. It was huge and very good. Not that you can mess up nachos- but it was great. The server and staff were exceptionally nice. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very attentive service from Rikki.  The Cozumel lobster habanero tacos were great!  Ceviche los cabos was very tasty as well as the prickly pear margaritas.  Tim, the GM, was very welcoming.  Great job for opening week."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place it when they have a sporting event. They can't handle the capacity! We waited over an hour and no one even acknowledge us. The manger BRENT couldn't even handle the over flow of cutosmers and coudlnt remedy the situation when we talked. The GM needs to step in and help this place.   End of story do not go there in th evening they can't handle it   If I could I would give them half a star!  #sucks"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. So service is great. Bartenders nice. Problem is the margaritas are horrible and way overpriced, food is barely acceptable. Bottom line won't recommend won't come back."}
{"text":"Live every day like it's Taco Tuesday.  I've been wanting to stop into Salt for a while and I finally got a chance to for Taco Tuesday.  $1-$3 for tacos?  Why the heck not!  We started off with the Traditional Ceviche [$14 - Cured Shrimp, fresh citrus, seasoned tomato juice, pico de gallo, fresh cucumber, and avocado.  Served with house fried chips.]  I also ended up ordering three different kinds of tacos:  Potato Taco [$1 - Potato with lettuce, cheese, and lime sour cream], Carnitas Taco [$2 - Topped with habanero pineapple salsa], and a Chipotle Shrimp Taco [$3 - Shrimp topped with lettuce and drizzled with coconut cream and lime].    The Traditional Ceviche is pretty straight forward.  I personally wouldn't order this since it's something easily made at home but my friend never had it and wanted to try it out.  It was a pretty decent ceviche that was definitely more heavy on the tomato juice.  I personally like my ceviche more chunky than soupy but it's just a preference thing and was still enjoyable.  The tacos were also pretty good.  I enjoyed two out of three of them.  The one I didn't enjoy was the Chipotle Shrimp.  I was expecting more of a San Diego style shrimp taco where it would be breaded and fried.  Totally not the case here.  It was also really sweet.  Unless we're talking about Choco Tacos, I don't prefer my tacos sweet.  The Carnitas and Potato Tacos were bomb though.  I actually ended up ordering another potato taco later on.  My friend said his Carne Asada tacos were pretty good as well.  I'm not a heavy eater but I must admit that four tacos and an appetizer didn't fill me up.  Since we came around 9PM on a Tuesday, they eventually dimmed the lights on us and started blasting the music.  There was a DJ, lots of people drinking, but nobody dancing.  I could have done without the seizure-inducing strobe lights and wish I sat outside because it ended up being a bit loud.  Now we know.  Now you know too."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We ordered the nachos and they were HUGE... Great service and awesome atmosphere. I will definitely be back next time we are in west gate!"}
{"text":"Okay food at best. Drinks always miss the mark. $12 for mediocre tacos is way over priced. Bill resembles something you'd expect at a descent steak house.  Young staff and attitudes, service is usually very slow. I've walked out previously"}
{"text":"Exceptional. I was in town for a sales conference at the arena. The placed was absolutely mobbed for lunch. But my server Lana was on point with a great attitude and quick service. Food was flavorful and plentiful. A bar back named Christian was great too. Very helpful with getting our unfinished food wrapped up to go. Great kid. Great service."}
{"text":"This is really a 2 1/2 star establishment. The service is VERY slow. The manger did not do much to help. The bar tender was jamming on making the drinks but she was the only one that worked fast.  The chicken burrito was good.  My husband had to wait quite some time to have bottled beer delivered to our table. The waitress just wanted to give us our check and get rid of us. Twin peaks restaurant was in the same vicinity and we highly recommend their establishment. Salt restaurant you should step up your game. Your competition is surpassing you in quality, service, and customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Love the servers, the drinks and food are awesome! I love everything about this place.  But the lady in the bathroom is creepy."}
{"text":"We wanted some good food before the GnR show. It took quite a while to get seated and an actually get waited on. Our servers were very nice and you could tell they were beyond busy.  Unfortunately they brought us the wrong appetizer, the Margaritas didn't contain any tequila that I could taste, and they completely forgot to cook my wife's food at all. It arrived freezing cold. Due to the time it took to get we just let it go as we didn't have time to wait.  Over all I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Lucky for us it' not blazing hot in the Arizona Sonoran Desert so we got to enjoy our green chile burrito out on the patio.  Food was good, Brooke was awesome!"}
{"text":"We were kept waiting to be seated for 10 minutes as parties behind us were seated. Finally us and another couple were seated in an area that was just opened up.  Great, except the greeter failed to tell a server that this new area had people seated. Finally after another 10 minutes, we asked the greeter, she had to find a server to work this area. The server moved over and got our drink orders and we did not see her for 5 minutes, So, we left, no one really seemed to care about customers in the front. With all the competition at Westgate, you would think they would try harder. But, first and last time for us. Waited 25 minutes and still never had a drink."}
{"text":"Overrated if you're over the age of 23.  This place is set up as more of a night club spot as opposed to a creditable restaurant.  The food is not that good and is over priced in my opinion.  It has a great location in the west gate entertainment district though.  Not a bad place if you're looking for more of a club environment but just not my style."}

{"text":"First time here, wanted to do the Taco Tuesday.. I had the potato taco which I think is left over mash potatoes, I thought  were just ok... I also had ground beef tacos which I didn't care for, I also had carne asada which were just alright, had the fish taco didn't care for it, had the shrimp taco that I enjoyed. Had the margarita that I enjoyed. The beer is pretty pricey... My hubs ordered Michelob ultra draft 2 of them and that alone was 21 bucks. I think this place is pretty over priced."}
{"text":"highly suggest salt! At westgate! Jessa and Danielle are the two best VIP girls on the entire  west side! They have always taken care of my group! I have gotten VIP service making sure both of them were my VIP girls because they are so good at what they do and they make sure your entire group is having/making a great memory!"}
{"text":"The inside is a cool atmosphere to eat in, but like many bars the music is loud. We had a group of 7 so they moved two chairs to two of their small square tables and crammed 3 people on each side with one at the end. It would have been nice if they moved another table over to give us more arm room. The food was alright, nothing spectacular. You can get much better Mexican food for a cheaper price and bigger portions. For a bar it was decent, but I wouldn't go back for the food."}
{"text":"1st and last time we'll go there, unless it's for a quick margarita or beer before going somewhere else. Service was adequate, there wasn't really anyone else there. Food was mediocre at best.  I did like the indoor/outdoor bar and lots of TVs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer before the Coyotes game. $8.25 for a 22oz Miller Lite Draft. YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME! No wonder it was only 1/2 full on an event night. No, I won't be back."}
