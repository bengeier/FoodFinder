{"text":"Nightmare experience at Kefi lounge. Horrible experience with their staff who seemed to be more interested standing around an empty restaurant talking to other wait staff than paying attention to their customers. Our entrees came out of the kitchen under cooked and when we brought it up to our waiter we received shrug and eye roll. Asked to speak to the manager but the manager never came. Do yourself a favour and stay away from Kefi. Wouldn't recommend the restaurant to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Great place, the ambiance is incredible ! 
Really big place with a bar in the front with booths, a back bar and a loft. Really great on Saturday nights. Definitely worth checking out ! Really great staff to top it off !"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience.....without even eating!
we wanted to visit this restaurant that we found on groupon and seemed to be cool, nice location , interesting etc. we went on friday evening, 7pm (after rainstorm). in any event, upon arrival place was 100% empty inside, and only 3 clients having a drink on the patio but on their way out. As soon as we told the waiter we have a groupon deal, he asked if we made a reservation. we said not and looked around being somewhat confused! (like i said place was totally empty!) he gave us this terrible attitude how we need to reserve and how they cant serve us if we dont have a reservation. the rules, as i have shown him on my phone clearly states that reservation is recommended but not required! he and \"the manager\"/cook where very annoyed we came without reservation while being totally empty. what a joke! we asked to speak to \"the manager\" but he never came out to meet us.
we just left and went elsewhere to beautiful place few doors down however being totally empty on friday night and sending away clients seem more of money laundry skim then a legit business!"}
