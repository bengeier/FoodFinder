{"text":"Always a line up for a reason. They will have the most fresh and delicious puffs you will ever have in your life. A nice crunch on the outside while the inside will melt in your mouth. My personal favourite are covered in chocolate and raspberry drizzle, to die for and very affordable prices."}
{"text":"I ordered Mr. Puffs a few times through JustEat and they just can't arrive at my door any sooner! One time, my order was received inaccurately, but the lovely gentleman who answered the phone took my information down and said he would send me, without additional cost, the correct batch on my next order. I was very impressed, he remembered and honored this verbal agreement and I received my compensatory box. Do yourself a favor and order the chocolate hazel glazed puffs. Holy goodness! Not diabetic friendly. Thanks again guys!"}
{"text":"Other than messing up your name staff are nice and puffs are bombs !! It's nice to have em close to home ! We are here two to three times a week!"}
{"text":"Les puffs à la cannelle et au sucre sont vraiment sans aucun doute phénoménal. C'est crispy et chaud tout droit sorti de leur cuisson et en plus le café glacé que j'ai pris en combo était bon, ça goûtait le café et pas un genre de café dilué.  Sans oublier de mentionner qu'ils ont des options végétaliennes."}
{"text":"Awesome. Only 3 places now but I bet there will be hundreds in few years. Crispy outside and soft inside. Good price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed MrPuffs!  They serve great coffee , puffs and ice cream and overall very kind courteous staff! Service was great"}
{"text":"We went in here after a sub par meal at the cheap party spot down the block.I had to have nutella and salted caramel. OmG these were gooood!!!If your on a diet don't come here."}
{"text":"I dont know what else to say about mr.puffs but wow. I can't get enough of these. Once you have one you can't stop eating them.  I am really not a big dessert person but these are too good to not have them once in a while."}
{"text":"I was sooo happy when they opened a Mr Puffs in Cotes des neiges! It is near a metro which is more convenient compared to other locations. So cheap yet so satisfying! If you have a sugar craving, definitelt consider this place. I ordered 30 puffs for 11$ only!  The place is small, they only have 3 tables. Good for take-out. I would recommend eating one right away just to taste how fresh they are !! Grab some if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"Did not fail to meet my loukoumades cravings. Everyone is new but already know what they are doing..hot and fresh as they are making them to go for the crowd.   Cute, sunny terrasse to enjoy your Nescafe Frappe on..but zero ambiance as it's in a parking lot on nightmarish st-jean(totally under construction)   It's dough. And sweet. And gooey. Just go."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried these wonderful light crispy puffs you are missing out on an incredible dessert. They are served hot and you have a choice of 10 different toppings. All are one better than the next. A must try!!! Be careful because once you try them you will be hooked! They have a great attentive and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Si vous trippez sur les desserts et tout ce qui est ultra gras et sucré, vous allez adorer! Pour notre part, nous sommes contents d'y avoir goûté, mais c'est beaucoup trop pour nous ! hihi  Sinon, l'endroit est propre, le personnel est accueillant et il y a pas mal de places pour s'asseoir!"}
{"text":"Mr. Puffs West Island    I still remember the first time going to Mr. Puffs in Laval. Now I don't need to travel far from my mom's house to this location.   Location: Blvd St Jean - Not a lot of parking here. West end of the city. And the traffic is terrible since they are working on St Jean. 4/5 stars   Atmosphere: It has a fast food style ordering. You go to the counter, order what you want and wait do pick up your food. It's a small hole in the wall with a few tables inside the building. A nice size patio as taken a few parking spots, but I guess that's a sacrifice they took in behalf of their customers 3/5 stars   Service: Well no real service here since you order over the counter and pickup your own food. The girl over the counter did have attitude. Hey if you don't enjoy the work you do, time to find something else. 2/5 stars   Food: This is mainly a dessert place with deep fried goodness, milkshakes, ice coffees, ice cream and cold drinks. They did have snack style dishes like spanakopita. So don't come here expecting a good meal. The puffs were good, but you need to eat them while they are hot. Once they get cold, the tastes changes. Please don't mistaken this place as a cream puff place, because if you do, you'll be greatly disappointed. 3.5/5 stars   Price: Not bad, $18 for a box 50, which comes to 0.36 pee puff. That's the only thing we ordered, so I can't really comment on the other stuff they have on the menu. But it was well priced. 4/5 stars   Overall: I will be back to buy some more. It's a on the way home to Toronto. But I think they need to ensure the front staff enjoys their job. Is there a way to keep the puffs warm? Either by microwave or oven? And if so, they should put instructions on their box. 3/5 stars  Follow me for more pictures on:  Instagram: 905japes Twitter: 905Japes"}
{"text":"This one is in a pretty good location on St Jean. The place itself isn't big but it is nice and clean. There was a little crowd waiting for their orders but the overall wait time wasn't bad. There is a good amount of choices and different box sizes which is good. They're always fresh and hot which is great! Crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. I suggest getting a box for dessert."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here!! The staff was super friendly on a holiday morning, and the puffs were fresh, hot, and delicious! There are so many flavors to choose from, but I went with a classic cinnamon-sugar dusting, and I don't regret a thing! That paired with a hot chocolate was a super, sugary start to a holiday. More puffs please!!"}
{"text":"The perfect dessert. Came here last night for something sweet to eat and this definitely did not disappoint. I ordered a box of 12 puffs to share. We were allowed to choose 2 toppings, which came out to $5 tax in. Very reasonable and affordable for what the product is. Upon finishing up, the employees gave us a second box on the house, most probably because they were closing and did not want the puffs to go to waste. Super kind and friendly staff. Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Honestly the perfect treat! We ordered a box of 12 with half strawberry and half creamy caramel. They came out hot and crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Super sweet and sinful (and not good if you're on a diet). Next time I would get the salted caramel because I think the salt and the sweet would go perfectly on the puff. For the price (5$ tax in), it is a pretty affordable dessert! The staff there were super nice and gave us a box of puffs that were left over at closing, which was appreciated. Lets just pretend I didn't eat 10 puffs in one sitting...oops"}
{"text":"Le café-filtre est en libre-service, à volonté et bien bon. Les \"puffs\" nous ont fait pensé à des \"Queues de Castor\" frites en boules. C'est hyper, hyper plaisant comme texture, chaud et croustillant à l'extérieur avec une pâte assez dense à l'intérieur. Tout était préparé sur commande mais le processus n'était pas très long, c'était super. L'ouverture du restaurant est récente alors les employés ont tous l'air assez fraîchement embauchés mais ils semblaient efficaces et surtout, ils étaient souriants et accueillants. En plus, même si leurs produits se prennent facilement pour emporter, j'ai remarqué qu'ils avaient quand même mit l'effort de rendre l'espace intéressant pour s'y attarder ou manger sur place.  Je croise les doigts pour que leur prochaine franchise ouvre dans mon quartier!"}
{"text":"J'adore ces petites boulettes. Servies bouillantes le plus souvent... impossible à manger sans se brûler la langue. Je préfère quand elles sont à température pièce. Le service est très rapide et souriant.   Cons : j'ai trouvé l'espresso imbuvable. Complètement oxydé. Pour moi ça veut dire que leur café pré-moulu est resté ouvert depuis trop longtemps. Je déconseil donc toutes leurs boissons à base de café.  Quand on commande une glace, on ne sert pas de cuillère. Il faut les demander : /. Le jeune service va vite prendre les bons réflexes j'en suis sûr.  Sinon porte qui claque énervante à fixer."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom Nom that's all you could hear while my daughter was destroying a puff hahahaha. She's a foodie in the making.  It's light, fresh, hot and so yummmmmmmy. My favorites are the chocolate hazelnut, my hubby loves the honey glazed and my daughter likes them all equally although I think she might have a preference for the strawberry and sugar loll.  The service is always good and fast, well located on cote des neiges right across from the Jewish hospital.   They also make some pretty good coffee based drink.   I really recommend this place if you are in the area and in the mood for sweets."}
