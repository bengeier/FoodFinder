{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in Toronto.  Food is consistently excellent.  Typical 'american style' thai menu with some (from what I've been told) more authentic thai items you will not find on other thai menu's in the city."}
{"text":"Great green curry chicken. We eat there often and use the take out regularly in the winter."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food I have had in Toronto, Spring Rolls being the worst one. Other than its not central location and slow waiter service,  I have no qualms about this place. Its food is as tasty as it gets. I had ordered a mixtures of dishes and I think each one of them was delightful."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go. Ordered 4-5 appetizers the last couple of times and you get a range of tastes and flavours that are just wonderful. So delicious. Service is great, always refilling the water glasses. Prices are very reasonable. The peanut and other sauces are really great, satay and all the salads just taste so fresh. Can't recommend it highly enough! You must go!!"}
{"text":"Revisited last night and service was much more prompt.  Ordered different dishes and all were delicious.  I have to say this is one of the best Thai places I have been.   Upping to five stars and highly recommending it.  BTW, I had the chicken with eggplant and it was wonderful."}
