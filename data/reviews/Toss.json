{"text":"Disappointing.  How does a pizza shop run out of pizza by the slice?  Decided to go with the Supreme Hoagie.   Less than supreme.   ."}
{"text":"First time at Toss.  Ordered steak hoagie and some wings.  Mancini bread!!! Perfect start to the hoagie.  Great to see they use local food products.  Good quality steak.  Great sandwich.  Wings were crispy and not greasy.  Buffalo and Sweet Mustard were a great compliment.  Owners were in there when i picked it up. Extremely friendly.  Have feeling this place will continue to get better and look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Stopped this evening for dinner with the family. We ordered honey jalapeno wings, tossed salad, and a large pepperoni pizza.
 Salad came we out and we were a little disappointed as the container was about 3/4 full. My wife and kids enjoyed the salad with the white balsamic dressing.
The wings then came out, they where nice and crispy withe a good amount of sauce. I enjoyed the honey jalapeno it had the right amount of heat.
The pizza came out next, it looked very good. Pizza had good amount of cheese and pepperoni. Pizza had a good flavor, loved the sauce. Reminded my wife and I of the Italian pizza that was at South park entrance in the 80's.
We will defiantly return to try other items."}
{"text":"Tried calling in for pizza 4 times today..no one picked up and went to a general voice mailbox."}
{"text":"Typical nothing special pizza joint.
$16 for large plain pizza over price I guess they feel they can raise prices high because it's in St. Clair and everybody supposedly has money. The place never seems to be crowded doesn't seem like there's anybody there picking up pizzas or ordering don't know how they stay in business"}
{"text":"This place has some work to do. The parking lot is small. The restaurant seemed clean. I think it's more of a takeout place as there is very little seating (two tables and some bar seating). They have a big menu and things are reasonably priced. I had the buffalo chicken hoagie, it was very greasy and the bread was falling apart. The fries were soggy. We ate in so I can't imagine how these things would have held up if they were taken home or delivered. The pizza seemed fine, nothing special. A friend I was with had the wings and wasn't crazy about them. I don't know the area too well but I'd imagine there are better options around."}
{"text":"We decided to order delivery from Toss at 5:30 on a Sunday evening. The girl who took order had us repeat our address 5 times. It seems to be a problem with their phone systems. It also seems as though she was unfamiliar with the computer system. Ordering was cumbersome. This may be because they are new.  

We were given an estimated arrival of 6:04. By 6:40 we had to call and see where our food was, she said it was 3 minutes out. It showed up at 6:45. 

We ordered 1/2 dozen dry rub wings and 1/2 dozen sauce wings. Also a medium pizza with two toppings and the total came to $33.78. This is a pretty steep price so I had some high expectations. 
The wings are mildly breaded/coated, almost as if they are dipped in flour before being fried. We tried the wing dust and the signature bbq. Neither were heavily coated which was a good thing. The sauce didn't make the wing soggy and the dry dust wasn't over powering. Both had good flavor over all. 

The pizza was adequate. The crust seems generic. It's not fluffy and soft nor was it crunchy and hard. It was an odd middle ground. There were plenty of toppings and the pizza was tasty. The sauce and cheese ratio was good. 

Overall for what we paid I expected a better product. The food was tasty but not a good deal for the price."}
{"text":"A week after I tried to order in person and was told they could not take any more orders that night because their computers were down, my kids convinced me to give them one more shot. Glad I did. 

We ordered pizza, the signature wings, and an Italian hoagie. First thing to note is for a new place, I was expecting the food to take a while. It actually came out within about 15 minutes, so I was pleasantly surprised about that. 

The hoagie looked good but I didn't try it, but my son really liked it. The signature wings were sweet with a bit of tang and reminded me of the root beer wings I've had at another local establishment. They were a tad salty but I loved the crunch on the breading and would definitely order again. 

The pizza was very good. Lots of cheese and I loved the crust. It's apparent they use quality ingredients. My only knock on this place is the price. The hoagies and wings seem very reasonable. A 16 inch large cheese pizza was $16. Looked like the calzones were $16-$18. So again, great quality, just be prepared to pay a little more for it."}
{"text":"We stopped in the day after opening day - of course we expected to wait. There aren't a lot of choices in the area for pizza, so this is a treat for us!

We walked in and it seemed as though most people hanging out were waiting on to-go orders. They have a huge menu - pizza, gyros, wings, salads, hoagies, etc! They even offer gluten free pizza! But keep in mind, it is cooked in a kitchen with gluten so it's not promised 100% gluten free.

We got the Greek pizza which was incredible! It took about an hour though which was a tough wait. Next time we might just have it delivered since there wasn't much seating while you wait. But the large pizza is probably enough for 3-4 people. It's cooked perfectly. Only thing I would've preferred was more seasoning on the actual crust - it was a little bland. We also ordered the house salad which was alright. It's topped with blue cheese which I don't think is necessarily a topping for a house salad, and came with a white vinaigrette. I probably would just go with Caesar next time.

Overall, it wasn't a deal breaker whatsoever. I realize they're still new so I won't criticize wait time. The owner (I believe it was at least) was very friendly and the whole staff is accomadating. I definitely am excited to return and try some wings and gyros!"}
{"text":"Stopped back again today for lunch, and ordered half of an Italian hoagie, and for $3 more I made it a combo, adding a drink and fries.  I thought the hoagie was pretty decent (I am glad to see they used Mancini's hoagie rolls, which are my personal favorite), but I really didn't like the fries at all.  They were warm, but didn't taste fresh.  I asked for some ketchup, but it really didn't improve upon them very much, so I ended up throwing most of them away in the garbage.  Also, the fancy Pepsi machine was not working properly today, I tried pouring a few different flavors, and they all tasted terrible, so I mentioned it to the staff, and they brought out a 2-liter bottle of Pepsi for me to fill my cup.  I'll still be back again on occasion, for pizza and hoagies, but I'll probably skip the fries next time."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a pizza after playing 18.  the parking lot is a little small with a couple of other stores and of course you have a couple of 'nice people' taking up 2 spots.  
The staff was friendly and our pizza was good.  The sauce has a little Italian/oregano flavor.  The crust is relatively thin and chewy but not the best.  They have one of those soda machines that has a about 100 selections with Pepsi products being the main attraction.  The parking lot is a little difficult especially when you have a couple of cars taking up 2 spaces."}
{"text":"Toss is an amazing spinnin pizza, flippin wing restaurant! Glad to be here for opening day! Their selection of food to choose from is great. Not only can you choose an amazing pizza, but different styles as well. They also have starters, hoagies, speciality hoagies, salads, phenomenal wings with sauces that are top notch, calzones, rolls, and gyros. You're able to walk-in an order, as well as call in for delivery, and they also offer sit down seating too. Fantastic job on the restaurant and wish them nothing but the best of luck! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews on here I feel like Yelp! Needs to do some scrubbing. A bit whiny and a few who just don't get what a new place goes through. Story goes they have been crushed from day one, then hit a huge computer problem that basically shut their doors to regroup. They did and its back to conquer the pizza world in the South Hills. What's important here? Food Quality! Service! They have both. 

The wings are dynamite. Fresh and cooked from scratch. They do take some time to prepare but they are unbelievable great! and worth the wait. So many inventive sauce choices as well. Order after order of wings went out of this place along with pizzas galore. The calzones are huge and tasty, fries are fresh cut, dough is made on site, sauces and dressing made in house - equipment is state of the art. Place is awesome! Everything here has the Guest in mind. I felt it. 

This is not dominos, if you want that quick stop conveyor belt pizza and some frozen wings that you get it in 10 minutes - go there. This spot is up and coming and puts those shops to shame. The food here is for the discerning gourmand and their taste buds. This is high quality, well produced and cared for Pizza Fare Plus!"}
