{"text":"If Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha all got together and made a veggie then it still wouldn't be as good as the nature burger from licks. I promise you it is the best veggie burger you will ever taste. 

Oh, and they have a great selection of other foods and even a good variety of ice cream. If you are from Oakville or just passing through you must try Licks. MUST."}
{"text":"Licks started off as a small burger joint in the beach with great food that was reasonably priced. Now the food is average at best and is way overpriced for what is still fast food. The singing of orders allows you to quickly identify the people you don't want putting the condiments on your burger- even worse they shout out your name because you told the cashier- why would anyone want to work there in such a goofy environment."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
The biggest challenge with chains like Licks is keeping the quality of service and product at a consistent level from location to location. Even more difficult is keeping quality high from employee to employee. I hadn't had a Nature Burger in over a year but after my last Nature experience at this location I think it'll be longer still before I brave another go. Man, that was a terrible, terrible burger. It was overcooked to shit and generally tasted the way I once feared veggie burgers tasted.

Also, a note for vegans, apparently the Nature burger, fries and onion rings are all vegan friendly, but the onion rings are actually deep fried with the chicken fingers (as they require a higher temperature than the fries. You can ask for your rings to be fried with the fries but the quality of the ring may suffer. My advice? Suck it up and have some meat. We're animals, people. 

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Gobbler (turkey burger) Always a great choice. Go ahead a get your normal burger toppings, unless you like ketchup on your burger. 
Homeburger (beef burger) One of the best fast food burgers on the planet, as I've come to know it.

SERVICE NOTES
As with all Licks locations, the classification \"quick service restaurant\" doesn't quite seem to apply but relax, they're cooking an actually burger back there. 

LOCATION NOTES
Slightly awkwardly located on the NW corner of Trafalgar and Cross Ave. If you're traveling south on Trafalgar there's an entrance just before the intersection, otherwise you'll have to access the lot off Cross Ave. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
Why does every restaurant that serves a veggie burger call it a veggie burger? I know some people refer to vegetarians as \"veggies\" but there also seems to be a rather large pocket of people that refers to such people as \"vegetarians\". So why are there no vegetarian burgers? Also, what makes a soy burger more \"natural\" than a beef burger?"}
{"text":"Beef and Turkey Burgers are A-ok.

Veggie burgers are among the best of veggie burgers.

Service is not fast enough for it to be a real \"fast food\" restaurant, but singing of the orders does greatly accelerate my chewing and swallowing speed so I can flee from the chanting."}
{"text":"Licks is a bit of an Oakville juggernaut - everyone seems to be either in love with the food, or so afraid of the singing that they stay far, far away. To those in the latter category: no staff have ever sung at me in this location. Have at it.

I started coming here regularly when I started working at a local software company. Out-of-towners, it seems, completely lose it for Licks when first introduced to it, though for good reason. The homeburger is hands-down my favourite quick service burger. As Bryan indicates, quick service isn't exactly the right term, but that's only because food is getting cooked when you order it. Topping selection is not quite as vast as Hero Burger, but they're all fresh, assembled where you can see 'em, and THE CHEESE IS REAL. Fries are tasty, too.

Service is usually very good - the staff tends to remember our names, and is only slightly flustered at times by our six-person group containing up to three Andrews. They all know what they're doing, too, which is a welcome change from the McDonald's next door.

It's pricier and slower than McDonald's, but the quality and taste is another universe. Definitely worth it."}
