{"text":"Great food and service.  Best tortilla chips around. Full bar with authentic and interesting options for those looking for more flavor and taste. Nice, small & quaint with wonderful service. Family owned and run.  Really invested in wanting to provide an all around good experience."}
{"text":"No need to drive to Champaign or Chicago anymore for authentic, handmade Mexican food! I had a steak taco and Gordita with amazing homemade salsa and guacamole. Looking forward to going back to try more of the menu and the weekend soup specials!"}
{"text":"Top notch - Exceptionally fresh and flavorful - delicious and good, wow!  We know good food and the enchilada verde here is amazing!  Margaritas are tasty and nice ambiance in the bar area.  The food here is on par with the best of Champaign County."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Truly authentic Mexican food. Ate here twice while visiting from DC. Enchiladas Verde was delicious. Also tried the steak nachos which had the best cheese sauce I've ever had. My favorite thing was the steak burrito. It's a must try! Delicious margaritas served in gorgeous Mexican/southwest designed goblets. Not too sweet or too sour... just perfect and didn't feel like I needed a nap afterwards!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here and it was amazing. Food was hot and fresh and the staff were friendly and very fast at serving. Overall a fantastic experience!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant at Mahomet. The food was great and the service was fast. I ordered the green enchiladas and a flan. Both of the items were delicious. My only criticism is tomato salsa. It will be better if they add more jalape√±os."}
{"text":"My wife convinced me to try Breaking Taco and I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered a few steak tacos and they were fabulous; on par with Maize Mexican Grill in Champaign, which I consider the gold standard of Mexican food in Champaign County.   The service was great and we were greeted with a smile. The pricing is also great. I didn't get to try a margarita but will next time.   Knowing that Breaking Taco is down the road from us, we will visit often. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I went with another person who started the conversation off with \"I don't like authentic Mexican food\" and I LOVE authentic Mexican food. When we left, the other person left satisfied and I left wanting more spice! The salsa was very tomato soup like with bland chips. Steak tacos were decent. Great price for tacos, $2.50. The rice was basically just white rice, no zazz to it at all.  Margarita was on point!"}
{"text":"Legit fresh and delicious Mexican food. Friendly staff. Nice atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. Great flavor to their dishes. Make a great margarita. Very happy Breaking Taco is in town. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious guacamole and tacos. My husband had the chile rellenos which were also excellent! He gave us generous samples of the hibiscus tea and the yummy rice water too!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Everything from the chips and salsa to the main entree was very fresh and authentic! Very friendly staff - I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Exceeding expectations. Could be the best Mexican food in Champaign County. The tortilla on the huarache was homemade, a little thick, and took the dish beyond even what Maize has to offer. Horchata was good, not to sweet."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. This place rivals Maize in Champaign. Love you - you should try it!"}
