{"text":"Wtf yelp, this place doesn't exist anymore. I walked over and it was gone. Checked Google maps and they knew it was permanently closed"}
{"text":"This spot is a great addition to dundas west! If you love hummus you will love it here. I like to pop in for their hot hummus with olives dish and a ginger beer. It's fairly priced and delicious, with a cafe-like atmosphere that's perfect for chilling out casually. Would, and do, go again."}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE.   The \"Humus\" itself - a mere yellow chick peas puree. Too dry and grainy, not creamy.  Ezra, pound some sense in your kitchen staff...  put some tahini in the paste ! Right now the meal functions as a sad vegan dip.  Also, being cheap on hot sauce, tahini side (NOT a topping) and extra pitas is just against the humus treaty and the Israel feel you're imitating."}
{"text":"Terrific hummus which is a good thing since this former Ezra Pound cafe reinvented itself as a hummus cafe.  The menu is very short and to the point--hummus with various options. Try the hummus with the \"works\" --very yummy with spiced meat (beef), olives, tahini, harrisa etc.   Since this spot is still owned by the founder of Ezra Pound the coffee is still superb. Next time will try the halvah with fresh oranges for dessert and one of their teas with mint or licorice.  A good spot for a light middle eastern bite during the day.  It's only open til 6pm."}
{"text":"The vibe: This is where Ezra's Pound used to be and it's owned by the same person as Ezra's. The new hummus bar has maintained the Ezra's casual environment. You order your food from the counter and then it gets brought to you. It's a nice place to go for lunch, and wasn't too busy when I went.   The food: Hummus galore! I went with a group of girl friends so I had the opportunity to try many things which is perfect for this tapas style joint. We ordered the regular hummus, hummus with warm olives (my favourite), walnuts and dates plate, and the feta plate. The feta plate was delicious. The feta was sprinkled with olive oil, mint and lemon. The portions are really large, which surprised me. We *almost* couldn't finish our walnut and date plate.   My go to meal: warm olive hummus & feta."}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate 'Pleasure' of visiting this ' Hummusia' earlier this week. I had read about it and was very excited. After all, a restaurant specializing in Hummus and all that it entails, MUST be good!! What a disappointment.!! If this is whats being pawned off as Hummus, by the 'Hipsters' and their ilk, what a sham!! If you served this Hummus ANYWHERE in the Middle-East, you would be laughed at, then beheaded!! I've eaten Hummus from cans that were tastier. The side order of olives, weren't much better. The ONLY redeeming edible item was the Pita. If this Hummus was any indicator of how their coffee was, I understand now why they closed the cafe."}
