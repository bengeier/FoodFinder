{"text":"the staff is super friendly. i ordered a big fa with fresh fries. The taste was a bravo."}
{"text":"This is a nice option for delicious food made with love in Montreal.  I spoke with one of the owners, who is kind and helpful, and respect what he and his brother have done.  While sitting over lunch I enjoyed the energy and the clearly passionate clientele lined up out the door.

There are four falafel options and five tahini choices, offered in pita, \"Big Fa\", SF pizza, croquettes, and salad.  What will surprise many is that everything offered is made in the store and is nearly vegan (except for the cheese)."}
{"text":"I'm an anti-vegetarian but I like the falafel pita here. $5 for a regular sized pita sandwich that contains three falafel balls. I think it's the same price for 8 falafel balls on their own. There are a few different falafel ball choices and sauces. The fresh toppings make me feel like I'm eating a tad bit healthier. The pita pizza with falafel spread looks interesting, will probably try that in the future. Pretty small place with only a handful of tables."}
{"text":"Petit comptoir avec quelques places assises dans la tour de bureau de mon travail. 

On commande en 4 étapes:
1- Choisir si on veut le BigFa (sandwich 9po sans friture), pita, salades ou boules de falafel;
2- Choisir le falafel : vert (persil, aneth, menthe), classique, ensoleillé (poivron rouge et oignon rouge) ou avec mozarella;
3- Choisir les garnitures comme au Subway (salades, tomates, olives, oignons, etc.)
4- Choisir parmi 5 sauces 

J'ai pris un BigFa, avec falafel vert, tout garni avec sauce tahini piquante. 

Mon impression : Le concept ressemble à un Subway version Falafel. On essaye de faire une version santé, mais on a tellement mis de la sauce que j'ai l'impression de mangé gras. Les garnitures ne sont pas originales. Ça fait différent, mais ce n'est pas les meilleurs Falafels que j'ai mangés. J'ai été surpris de lire que pour certains c'était les meilleurs de Montréal. Dans mon cas, j'ai mieux aimé les falafels au restaurant Panthère verte qui sont plus santé, plus originaux et plus gouteux. 

Le service est rapide et courtois. 

Prix abordable, moins de 10$."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and warm - with a friendly proprietor and very fair prices. Try their Big Fa for a cool new twist on the traditional falafel - baked rather than fried.  Mmm."}
{"text":"So HAPPY to finally have found a fully vegetarian falafel restaurant. My husband and I have been in love with the Maoz chain restaurants, and were sad that there was nothing comparable in Quebec. But this place is absolutely amazing. They are so kind, welcoming and will tailor your food to your taste. We have been 5 times already and cannot praise it enough. We are so thankful for another great veg restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very cheerful place with clean and bright colors.
The service is fast, and falafels are fresh. Their menu is concise and clear, and everything is very tempting! I have a soft spot for the \"Melty\" falafel, a cheese-filled bundle of joy. I also tried them wrapped in pita, which was nice. The flavors really come through, which makes it worthwhile to try the different falafels. 

During lunchtime on weekdays, both Vua and Falafel Avenue get huge lineups, with Falafel Avenue being slightly less crowded!"}
{"text":"Falafels are absolutely delicious. They have great options (salad, sandwiches) and the sauces are amazing. Staff is very friendly and polite too. Definitely worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"This place is honestly quite special, I personally don't know any other falafel places with such variety in falafel flavor and sauce in Montreal. Everything I've tried tasted really good, I especially like their cheese falafel and the VG sauce. I prefer their classic wrap over the pizza or the 'big fa' since they use falafel spread instead of the actual falafels so you lose a lot of the texture. The portion isn't huge, but it's cheap and you get what you paid for. Their fries are also really good when it's fresh, try them during busy hours. We made the mistake of going at like 3pm and getting stale ones, which they shouldn't sell to begin with but oh well."}
{"text":"Amazing place, worth the stop for vegans or meatlovers on a break, i understand they cannot stay open till very late but we sometimes get cravings for it late night, our first stop, after their opening was very disappointing, but management took care of it in a fair way! Very happy and satisfied since our second visit !"}
{"text":"Yummy! A few different kinds of falafel, a few different kinds of sauce. 

Awesome, friendly service which is important to me. 

4$ sandwich makes me feel less guilty about not bringing my lunch to work."}
{"text":"Wow! Best spot next to where I work. Vegan, clean, nice service and not expansive at all. I come back here all the time!"}
{"text":"was I was strolling and came across this place. First time having falafel and it was a very delicious. When telling them I was good and free they told me what I canning cannot have and we're very helpful. Definitely will be coming back before I leave Montreal"}
{"text":"I first discovered Falafel Avenue at their downtown location and was very happy when they opened this second location in the Plateau. I'm a falafel lover and I can honestly say this is some of the best falafel that I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of falafel!) Super flavourful and the traditional fried falafel are freshly made for each order. The big fa (baked falafel) is also delicious and very filling. The service is excellent and I also love the decor with a beautiful mural by a local artist. My husband and I love this place and visit or order delivery through Just Eat almost every week."}
{"text":"Lovely place to eat. Limited indoor seating but otherwise just a gorgeous place to grab falafels. I always get the falafel pitas, and the falafels au fondant and the original ones are my absolute favourite. The staff is very kind, courteous, and very very quick. The food is fresh, tasty and inexpensive for what you get. A single falafel pita is enough to fill you up- they don't gouge you for your product. The options are fair too- you can get a side salad (that you can customize) and a vegan dessert! I love dropping by after class to grab a snack."}
{"text":"As of today, best falafel joint in Montreal. Mind you, I admit to not having tried every falafel places in town, but I have tried many. Growing up with an Egyptian mother, I have a decent background on how they should taste. Average size place to sit and eat and the staff is very friendly and efficient. You can't really ask for more when it comes to a place that serves a quick meal, particularly for lunch. The place offers a few different flavors or falafels and tahini dressing/sauce."}
{"text":"First time here, the food was amazing and I ended up overeating because it was so tasty. I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Working downtown I always welcome an alternative to the usual food court fare.  Falafel Avenue's focus is on falafel as you might have guessed from the name and is an excellent option if you are in the McGill area.  Prices are reasonable and the food is great.

There are a variety of falafels and they bake them which makes them healthier.  You choose the ones you want and you can also choose between having them in a classic pita, sandwich, etc.  You can also get a trio which includes a drink and choice of either fries, salad or dessert.  My only complaint is that they were out of what I originally wanted and it was only the beginning of the lunch rush.  I still ended up enjoying my classic pita falafel  but they need to plan for busy periods a little better.  Also the fries are pretty delicious.
 
The owner is very welcoming and even during a lunch rush he tried to make conversation with his customers.  Prices are very reasonable especially by downtown standards.  My lunch cost me less than $10 and the quality was certainly quite high for fast food."}
{"text":"We went for the free falafel on the opening day and were very impressed. They are fresh, flavourful and delicious. The prices are very reasonable and the restaurant is new and comfy. I really liked how they have many varieties of falafel with some less traditional types. I found the staff to be very pleasant and welcoming and am looking forward to coming back and trying more!"}
{"text":"Falafel Avenue ouvre enfin une deuxième succursale, cette fois-ci sur le Plateau! Dès qu'on rentre dans le restaurant, on est accueilli par une enseigne néon \"Végé & Fabuleux\": ici, il n'y a pas de viande au menu! En fait, si ce n'était pour le falafel Fondant (à la mozzarella) et les sachets de mayonnaise, le menu serait entièrement végane. En espérant qu'il le devienne un jour! Je crois qu'il ne serait pas difficile de remplacer le fromage par une alternative végétalienne (et montréalaise!) comme GUSTA.

Dans tous les cas, le menu de Falafel Avenue est relativement simple et la prise de commande et la confection des plats (devant vous!) se déroulent bien et sans confusion. D'abord, vous choisissez parmi 5 plats principaux (sandwich Big Fa, pizza, pita, croquettes, salade). Si vous cherchez une option santé, allez-y pour le sandwich Big Fa ou la pizza: dans les 2 cas, les falafels sont cuits au four et étalés en spread. Vous avez ensuite le choix entre 4 falafels (attention: le Fondant contient du fromage) et 5 sauces. On vous demandera également de sélectionner les légumes à inclure dans votre sandwich ou votre salade (laitues, tomates, poivrons, navets, etc.).
Même si j'aurais aimé que le menu soit plus varié (à quand d'autres plats à base de pois-chiches comme du hummus?), j'ai été agréablement surpris par le rapport qualité-prix. Comptez une dizaine de dollars seulement pour un trio incluant BIg Fa, salade (ou frites) et boisson! Même les desserts (gâteau au chocolat, gâteau aux bananes et sfouf), qui sont d'ailleurs tous végétaliens, sont vendus à 3$ chaque.

Vous pouvez manger sur place (environ une douzaine de places assises sont disponibles) ou prendre pour emporter. L'endroit est propre, neuf et inspire confiance. Contrairement à d'autres restaurants du genre, le personnel de Falafel Avenue est souriant, très sympathique et explique bien les différences entre les plats. Je regrette toutefois que, même pour les commandes consommées sur place, il y ait une sur-utilisation de contenants en plastique, en papier, etc. C'est dommage qu'il y ait autant de déchets.

Au final, je suis très content de l'arrivée de Falafel Avenue sur le Plateau. L'enseigne apporte un plus à l'offre actuelle des restaurants végétariens et véganes à Montréal. À essayer pour le lunch ou pour un soir de semaine où vous n'avez pas le goût de cuisiner!

{"text":"I ordered from here for delivery and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Prices are very reasonable...8 falafels for only $5.00, side of fries for $3.00.The menu is pretty limited, but it works. Falafels were very good and extremely filling. Fries are probably some of the best I've ever had - so worth it! Their food is definitely great comfort food. I called to confirm a few things with the staff because of allergies, and they were very helpful. For those with allergies, their falafels are gluten-free! Delivery was also very quick - took about 15 minutes max.

When a friend and I went to dine-in, the food was just as good. The man serving us (must have been the owner), was beyond friendly and helpful. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but it's very nice and clean. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for cheap, and good falafel!"}
{"text":"It took me just one opportunity to realize how i love falafels. And this place is definitely responsible for that. Crunchy outside and moist inside. 

Falafel avenue is more like a fast service... to go... style... place. I just could not find the right words to define it. 

They have 4 different falafels and for me the MUST TRY ones are: the fondant (with cheese inside) and the vert. 

On top of that... you can try a pizza, witch is a pita bread, falafel dough spread, grilled and topped with... well... cheese and veggies. 

Oh... if you like potatoes... they have a delicious fries... 

Anyway... anything you order will feel like you had a full meal."}
{"text":"I cam here from Israel so I can say with 100% certainty that I know my Falafel and in Montreal this is as good as it gets. In order for a Falafel to be good it needs to be FRESH, made on the spot for the costumer and not sit and dry in a bowl. 
Here they make Traditional style and newer style (that in the middle east started 10-15 years ago) where you make green or red(spicy) style Falafel balls. They also have a nice cheese filed version. 
What I loved here is the \"Big Fa\" a which is like a pizza made from Falafel and Pitta extreamly good and you can usually find it in Turkey and the pocket pita (whihc is a normal pita in the middle east) and of course there multiple versions of Thini (sesame) sauce. Its not the best Falafel I had but it is the best one I had in Montreal. Go try it"}
{"text":"Falafel avenue the best falafel in Montreal they are crunchy from the outside and tasty in the inside. Ingredients are super fresh and the staff are super welcoming"}
{"text":"My favorite I-have-time-to-kill-and-am-moderately-hungry place! I seriously come here so much, I am guessing I am three purchases away from getting recognized by the staff. Always clean, friendly service, amazing prices! I always get the Big Fa with sunny falafel and spicy tahini and add onions! Delicious!!"}
