{"text":"Nice ambiance in this local eatery.  Jazz on Tuesday nights gave Thornhill a touch of downtown. But if you want to talk, then avoid Tuesdays.   It's quite cozy and the music fills the room.   Food is excellent and good value.  Varied Italian menu with seafood pasta especially good.  Meat and fish entrees came with vegetables.  Service is okay."}
{"text":"One of the real Italian place. Good foods and wine selection. We order the typical dishes and they all turn out the way it should be."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly and comfortable restaurant.  Remember to make reservations early as it fills up fast on weekends.

Environment - very cozy spot.  Looks family owned and very comfortable with fabric seats and carpeted floors.

Service - great service and friendly staff.  Always the same staff every time we go.  they seem happy with their job and likely have been around for a long time.

Food - price fixie menu is great.  Bruschetta is the best in the city.  I have not had better.  It is their signature i believe.

Pricing - very great pricing, cheaper than all the new Italian restaurants nowadays.  Our go to spot for great casual food without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"The meal was fabulous!! From the bread,  the bruschetta and salad to the delicious veal Parmesan!! From beginning to the end was amazing!  
The tiramisu was the best I have ever had followed by delicious coffee!!
All in all the best Italian meal I have had!
When we return to Toronto we will definitely return!!
Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"OMG the Ziti al Forno is AMAZING!!! We went to Santo's last night for mom's bday, and I'm so sad that it's not close by my house. The sauce was salty but so addictive *drool

The outside doesn't look it (the restaurant is located at a very plain looking plaza, to be honest I probably wouldn't have walked in if it weren't for the Yelp good reviews :P), but inside the decor is nice and comfy. The service is very warm and friendly indeed. They brought out a bday sundae and sang the song with us.

Yummm I'm already planning my next visit"}
{"text":"Was here for my bday meal.

Cozy restaurant hidden in a North York plaza off Yonge Street (north of Steeles) - was pleasantly surprised! There was sufficient parking in the plaza which was convenient. NO PIZZA!!!

Accidentally binged before dinner so, split the calamari and mushroom risotto.

Calamari - 5/5 (served with two types of dipping sauces and sauteed bits of garlic and fresh herbs...generous portions...oddly, no calamari rings but, I didn't care)
Mushroom risotto - 5/5 (tons of mushrooms...the risotto was perfectly cooked which is very rare because most places, the risotto has the consistency of mucus or sand...you could really taste the cheese...came out hot...generous portion as well)

My friends had the veal and chicken parmesan and they said it tasted great. Huge portions as well.

Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love eating at this restaurant. Food is consistently good, well priced and cozy. Even had live music the one night that we went."}
{"text":"The food was okie but the tiramisu doesnt taste like tiramisu, which is more like a sponge cake. Salmon / veal were both overcooked. The servant doesn't speak good English which gave a hard time to order n get bill done properly. Anyhow it is still a place to go in uptown considering a big parking lot."}
{"text":"Came here for 2 years anniversary with my hubby, service is excellent, food price is very reasonable, portions worths very large. Four courses for $35 and very delicious. The environment was ambient, and family friendly. Will come back again!!b"}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night to celebrate my birthday. Small place by Food Basics  inside the plaza. 

Food was amazing. Service was great. Inside was intimate and romantic. 

This is what I had...

SANTO'S FOR COURSE DINNER SPECIFIC:
- BRUSCHETTA - Delicious! On garlic toast so soft and flavourful
- SOUP OR SALAD - I had the Caesar because they daid it was great but I thought it was just okay
- ENTREE - I had VEAL PARMIGIANA (veal breaded and baked with tomato sauce and mozzarella server with pasta in tomato sauce) Really good!! Pasta on home made tomato sauce.
- TIRAMISU OR SPUMONE ICE CREAM - I got both ans both was amazing and authentic
MONTEPULCIANO D'ABRUZZO RED WINE - This house pour was great and went so well with my meal
ROASTED GARLIC ANTIPASTI - If you love garlic, this is for you!!! So soft, so garlicy and the sauce it comes with is tangy and goes very well with the garlic I almost wanted to lick the plate! Also comes with sun dried tomatoes.
MUSTARD PEPPER SALMON (filter of salon in white wine sauce, mustard seed and fresh herbs) - The salmon was cooked to prefection. It was soft on the inside and just right on the outside. The sauce along with the mustard seeds kicked me just the right way.

Overall I will come back for the food and for the overall service!"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. 

Came with mom and pop and we got the set dinner menu with soup/salad, bruschetta, veal parmigiana/risotto/salmon and dessert. And for real everything was SO GOOD. Every bite I felt umami fill my mouth...flavours so on point. The sundries tomatoes of the bruschetta, drizzled with olive oil; or the pistachio ice cream with fruits ever so sweet. Everything was perfect and flavours were full and amazing. 

I will definitely come back for the risotto and mussels next time...I look forward to seeing you again santos."}
{"text":"Loved it! We had office Christmas party at Santo's last week and the food there was just incredible. I had bruschettas and mushroom salad for appetizer and veal quatro formaggio (in 4 cheese sauce) as a main dish. My friend had beef tenderloin and I tried a piece - perfect! 
The decor and service was so so, but the food was so incredible that we didn't really care. The restaurant is quite expensive, glad the company was paying :) Yet, it certainly goes to my list of places for special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is da BOMB and probably some of the best Italian food I have ever had!  The food is unreal and chef Mario D cooks up a storm. I used to work here as a server and have been here lots of times for dinner! That should communicate volumes about the food and its quality.

Everytime it has met our expectations (and we have high expectations for this place). My parents are vegetarian and the chef cooks up some nice vegetarian mains. If you call a day or two ahead of your visit, they will even cater to special requests and items not on their menu. The Roasted Garlic Appetizer is wicked good, the Tiramisu is to die for and the mains are delicious as well. They have a good wine and drink selection. 

Its true that the waiters and patrons are generally \"older\", but given that the place is located in the 'burbs, has GOOD food and is not a box retaurant, cant really expect the moxies/milestones vibe.  And recently, they renovated their interior and it looks nice! If you are going to visit on a Saturday night, make sure you have RESERVATIONS! otherwise you will be asked to leave/get frustrated with the wait and maybe post negative comments for a place that serves delicious food."}
{"text":"I'm only visiting Toronto and have found a number of very good Italian restaurants, but only here have I found one that captures the atmosphere of the family owned and operated Italian restaurant so well known in New York, New Jersey and Boston. The food was very good but made all that better by a wonderful atmosphere. You need to come here and slow down and enjoy it."}
{"text":"My rating on this restaurant is 3.5 stars.  Found this place on yelp and went for dinner on a Saturday night.  Walked into a full restaurant and got one of the last tables available so I definitely recommend making reservations. Not your typical trendy restaurant,  more of an old school neighbourhood spot. The food we ordered was again good but dated.  Caprese salad had no basil which im really picky about,  and minestrone was good if you're in the mood for a soup.  We had a penne vodka and risotto al funghi for mains and both were good not great.  No room for desert as portion sizes are large.  Service was good only thing I could critique is that mains came out way too quick which rushed our meal and bottle of wine. Server even came out to give us our take out that we left behind when leaving, which is much appreciated and hence the extra half star!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service,great atmosphere. Music a little too loud, hard to talk.

The bruschetta was excellent.
The 2 other veal mains were also fantastic.
Ordered tiramisu for dessert, it was light and fluffy.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I decided to go Santo's for Mothers Day Dinner. My expectations were high but I left disappointed. I understand that was hectic  due to Mothers Day...but that doesn't  excuse the bad service and below  average  food for the price we paid."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here at Santos. The portions were generous, the environment was warm and inviting - it was a bonus that we came on a Tuesday and we got to eat with live jazz playing. I enjoyed the flavours of my pasta ...yum! My fettuccine rustico (with smoked shredded beef, mushroom, cracked peppercorn in vodka sauce) was really good, my friend's mushroom risotto was really yummy too (and I'm usually very picky with my risotto), the bruschetta and the fried calamari are must orders as well! Especially the bruschetta because it's usually not done well at other restaurants. It was SO good at Santos, I could have had more! I'm definitely going to go back to Santos for another dinner...I already know I want the Spaghetti Carbonara (cream sauce and bacon and egg goodness!) And am secretly hoping someone orders the mushroom risotto again :p A must try place for all pasta lovers and all pastas are very reasonably priced. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I can't speak for all the other reviews here, but I would not consider coming back to eat here again, even if it were free. My friend mentioned this place had good reviews last time we hung out, but we went somewhere else. He suggested to come here tonight and it was his birthday celebration so we came here. It's close by, good reviews, why not? 

The environment inside was nice. We went earlier, around 6pm, so it was empty. The decor is much fancier inside than how it appears outside. It looked expensive from the outside - it was. The staff was friendly and paid attention to us, which was nice. There's live music in the corner, we caught the tail end of it.

The birthday boy and I ordered the 4 course (bruschetta + salad/soup + entree + dessert). The last person ordered veal with artichoke. Our soup was some sort of zucchini-squash, which was hot and delicious. They put on pepper and parmesan. There was bread on the side - it was cold - but went well with the soup. 

Next came the bruchetta, which was also decent. It was hot and garlic-y. I think they gave us an extra piece since we had 3 people, but only two of us ordered the 4 course special. We enjoyed it. 

Then came our entrees - I ordered seafood risotto. It looked like a hot mess on a plate - not appetizing at all. I'm not one to be big on plating, but there were smudge marks ALL over the plate. There were mussels, squid, and a couple pieces of shrimp. The risotto was very wet, almost soup like. It's hard to hate on something when the staff and environment is nice, but honestly, it tasted like soupy rice, made poorly with canned chicken broth and cream of mushroom soup. I had a couple spoons of the dish and stopped eating completely. 

The birthday boy had the salmon with mashed potatoes. It didn't look good, but it tasted fine (especially comparing to the other entrees). 

Our last friend had the veal - he wanted something cool and artichoke sounded yummy. His vegetables and mashed potatoes tasted like they were drowned in butter. I didn't have his veal, but he didn't enjoy it compared to other veal he's had in the past. 

We finished it off with tiramisu - again, not the best. The cheese tasted like it was heavily mixed with whipped cream. There was not enough coffee liqueur nor espresso taste either.

As mentioned earlier, we caught the tail end of the live music. It was nice and pleasant. We liked the atmosphere. The food was meh. But the music was good. Unfortunately you can't eat music."}
{"text":"On our first night in Toronto, my nearly 15 year old son asked me to lookup a good Italian restaurant for dinner. I found this place on Yelp and we drove over there to find that it was closed for a private party. We ended up having surprisingly good pizza at a counter service place. We tried again last night, and found that they had a jazz band and all tables were reserved all night. We ended up having homemade, delicious pasta at another surprising counter service place. I made a reservation for tonight. We had what my son considers to be the best Chicken Parmesan ever. He was as happy with this meals as those we've had in Italy. Success!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem tucked away in a rundown area on Yonge. Don't let the outside façade of the restaurant fool you, this place is all the more impressive inside! 

We have been here twice, and were met with impeccable service both times. We mainly tried their pasta, and overall they give a generous amount of food.  

There are some hits and misses in their pasta menu:

Hits:
1. Fetuccine Rustico - al dente pasta, with the right balance of sauce, pasta, and smoked beef & mushroom.
2. Capellini Con Cozze E Salmone Affumicatto - angel hair with mussels and smoked salmon. Lots of mussels, angel hair was done well, however the smoked salmon is not the best grade - but acceptable. Would be better if it is less salty. 
3. Spaghetti alla Cabonara - classic dish done well! 

Misses:
1. Veal Santo's - breaded veal is so-so, and too much tomato sauce
2. Risotto Milanese Con Gamberi - risotto too mushy, decent sized shrimp, veggies so-so
3. Spaghetti Con Gembri and Broccoli"}
{"text":"Decor & Ambience: Comfortable, Traditional decor. It is packed and happily buzzing. 
Service: Welcoming, warm, very friendly. You are part of their family in the restaurant. 
Food: Excellent, priced right, vegetarian friendly, generous portion sizes which make for a good meal at home the following day. 
I am in love with their Capellini Saporiti. It's one of the best that I've had & I'm including the Italian restaurants in NYC that I've been to. The Risotto al Funghi & the Capellini Primavera was also excellent. Their penne vodka dishes that I've trued previously have also been good, so are their vegetarian soups.
They also make one of the best tiramisu in the GTA.

Tip: The wait for your meal is longer than average sometimes 45 min but totally worth it.
They have a good collection of wines & if you order a bottle of wine for the table, it is served with a complimentary Bruschetta appetizer which comes in handy during the long wait. 

Now this is the classy, classic neighborhood restaurant which you keep going back to."}
{"text":"We were here with a party of 17 for a pre-Xmas dinner. There were small children and one 96-year old, so it was a tough group. There was a set menu with choices, but the service was slapdash and sometimes abrupt, the food just OK--bruschetta, salad, pasta for the kids, fish/risotto/steak/chicken for adults/dessert. Nothing was terrible, nothing very well done. I doubt I'd ever return here."}
{"text":"Friendly and excellent service, foods are great, and we are enjoying the live music tonight"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and while the food  is good, the service is seriously lacking. As in not enough staff for the patrons and you have to sit there waiting 20 mins for someone to even bring you water. If you are looking to kill time and have 3 hours to spend eating dinner then by all means come here. The food is decent enough but not super special. But the service is so very poor."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised about this place since it's located in a strip mall beside a No Frills but the service was great and the food tasted amazing. I find usually places that serve large portions don't always taste very good but that's not the case here. Large portions and the food is fantastic. I had the Veal Santos with potatoes and vegetables. I'm excited to come and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here mid-week for a double dinner date with a good friend.  Santos is definitely a popular restaurant and thankfully we made reservations since we came during prime dinner time.  The interior is classic, with lots of warm tones everywhere to give it a romantic feel.  For those who love live music, due take advantage of it every Tuesday.
In terms of food here's the breakdown:  
*Caprese Salad- not too impressed, the Boccaccinni cheese should have been flattened to mimic the size of the tomato slices, it seemed a bit off, however nonetheless it was a great dish. 
*Bruschetta- This came complimentary with our purchase of a bottle of wine.  I'd say this is one of the best bruschetta's I've ever had.  
*Gnochhi - Jen's dish was definitely a home-run, perfectly cooked, prepared, served with a delicious white wine sauce with some tossed in broccoli.
*Risotto Milanese con Gamberi, beautifully plated and presented.  The risotto was cooked perfectly, aka Al-dente. Though the dish was cooked perfectly, I felt that this dish was missing something, it had all the right concept, but it didn't impress me from a flavor perspective.

Overall, a hidden gem, the food, service, ambiance and price, it's no wonder why people keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband around 8pm on a Wednesday evening and the place was quite busy.  We pretty much had to seat ourselves and we did not even get a menu until my hubby walked up to the front and got it himself.  We ordered a tomato basil soup, baked ziti and a gnocchi, which took ages to arrive (but in all fairness the ziti was baked which was probably the cause for delay).  

The food wasn't spectacular and the ziti was still scorching hot after 30 min of mouth burning.

What made the experience not amazing was the fact that the table next to ours kept on sending dish after dish back The two servers were bending over backward to appease this group of elderly nitpicks, who kept on insisting that nothing be cooked with oil. For Pete's sake, don't eat out if you can't eat oil!  They sent back enough food to feed another party of three to five.  This pretty much made the service to all other tables non-existent, which did not make a good first impression."}
{"text":"FAB-U-LOUS. 

The first clue that this will be an exceptional meal is the complimentary bruschetta. This is among the best, if not THE best bruschetta I've had in the GTA.

Caesar salad....fantastic.

Mushroom salad....fantastic.

If you're feeling really indulgent, get the ROASTED GARLIC appetizer. I get it every time I come here. It's enough for two to share. Two expertly roasted heads of garlic arrive on a generous bed of addictive cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, and toasted baguettes. Give that baguette a wicked dip in the creamy goodness, apply a generous shmear of soft roasted garlic...and wowsers!!! Incredible.

Personally when I come to Santo's it's all about veal. They do wonderful things with veal scallopini (aka thinly sliced). I usually go for the veal marsala but if I'm feeling extra indulgent I'll order the veal \"quattro formaggi\" aka four cheese, which is just divine. The veals come with a side....I always request a side of angel hair pasta made simply with garlic and olive oil. It just goes so well with the veal. Mmm...molto bello!!

The interior decor is class all the way....ambiance is more downtown than uptown. Service is top notch.

Plain and simple, Santo's is a gem."}
{"text":"I came here with my mother and we shared a  Linguine Fruti di Mare and asked to sub for a cream sauce. It was full of depth and perfectly seasoned. It was not overly heavy but very satisfying.  We also shared a chicken breast with vegetables and mushrooms. The chicken was of superb quality, moist and had great taste. The vegetables were a great as well and rounded out the meal.

Service was to the point and friendly. The decor is slightly dated but warm and clean. The live jazz music on Tuesday evenings is a nice touch as well. This place beats out all the popular box restaurants. Good family restaurant."}
{"text":"On Monday night, after seeing the reviews I called many times and no answer, end up driving down and I think they have close down the place :("}
{"text":"Really good Italian restaurant! Good atmosphere and the food is always fresh. They make everything from scratch there even their tiramisu. Decent prices too. Every meal I've had there was delicious."}
{"text":"From the mushroom soup to the fried calamari to the New York steak to the primitivo wine, I really enjoyed the meal that I had here with my family. Only quibble would be that they could've used more bodies waiting tables as I could see the three servers struggling to avail themselves to a full house. Restaurant has a cozy and intimate atmosphere that I appreciated."}
{"text":"4 stars for food
What else can I say - been here on and off for a few years, like maybe once a year.  The food is GOOD and authentic Italian.  

Please, please, please don't mind the stripe mall and older neighborhood, and give yourself a chance to this local gem.  You will be glad that you have."}
{"text":"It is just ok. Pasta was just average.  Bruschetta was good. Calamari not good.Portions are huge.My elderly parents love it. And the age of the diners is way above average."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place after 4 visits! So let me just start by saying this really is a hidden gem. I never noticed this restaurant before until I searched for Italian food in Thornhill, then boom! There it was. 
This place gets busy on weeknights and weekends so make sure you make reservations. Weekday evenings aren't as bad but there's only one or two front staff so expect to wait and wait and wait. If you don't have patience, this place isn't for you. But if you are willing to wait for very tasty, very fair priced Italian meal, check it out! 
I've had so many things here. Here's my faves:
Homemade soup! The red pepper and eggplant soup is 10/10!!! 
Seafood linguine with tomato sauce. So tasty, perfect pasta, delicious seafood
Creamy mussels with pasta. yum yum yum
NY Steak. Very juicy and great flavour and perfectly cooked
House Salad. Okay like seriously, who makes good house salad anyways? But my oh my, I like this one! 
and lastly, the grilled calamari. It is so tender and good!!! 
What I wasn't too fond of was the  spaghetti with meat sauce. The sauce was too salty but it could just be that time. 
For dessert, the ice cream and tiramisu are both superb!!
Okay, I'm totally hungry now. Need to find me some food....."}
{"text":"Saturday Dinner at Santos was great. Very friendly welcome and warm atmosphere. We got complimentary Bruschetta as we booked through Yelp so that was a delicious bonus! Our wine was good and not too pricy. Good selection to choose from.  We had Salmon with Vodka sauce and Caporitti dish with angel hair pasta , wild mushrooms and feta cheese. Both dishes were really good and a really good serving. 
Then we had Tiramisu, so light and delicate. Really good dinner and reasonably priced . Would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"To start the service was un-inviting, and very moody. The staff here seem like they've worked there so long and have gotten comfortable. There's no passion or even a smile to greet us. It's as if we're a bother to have arrived and they have to do work now. 

More on the staff later.

The food is very expensive and not worth the money. I purchased the steak with caesar salad. Steak had no flavor. It didn't taste marinated, it didn't taste like it was cooked with sauce at all. It was just cooked meat. I mean even melted butter would have been nice. The caesar salad was good. Nice crisp lettuce, good sauce and cheese was fantastic. So good I would have rather a bowl of salad over the steak. 

The pasta with shrimp, didn't have the wow factor. The bruschetta was decent, tasted like pizza. Although when we ordered gluten-free pasta, they cooked our dish with Thai noodles. Very odd for an Italian restaurant to not have regular gluten free pasta, instead substituting with rice noodles is unheard of. 

The staff service is poor. They will yell at their other employees in front of customers. It's not professional, it's embarrassing to the staff member and it just makes it seem like people hate their life there. I think it was the owner who felt he needed to be involved in everything. 

Our server was rushing us to take our order, as if we were an inconvenience to him, and wouldn't annunciate his words, which meant hearing the orders through his accent, and Italian named dishes and quick speech was very difficult. I asked him to repeat and he didn't change his speech at all. He expected me to know what each menu item's title referred to, making newcomers very unwelcome.

He would stand and watch 2 feet from our table making us uncomfortable, as it made it seem like a classroom and he was our teacher. 

When we were singing happy birthday and taking photos of our grandmother before she blew the candle out, our server came by and took glasses off our table and put his arm in front of my grandmother in between her and our cameras, and then asked, does anyone need anything, essentially ruining the moment. 

We are all trying to celebrate and laugh in awe of how happy she is, so being surround by her family, with a lit candle in front of her. I don't understand how this server thought it was the right time to come over at all, let alone stick his arms in front of the cameras, AND, then interrupt the moment by asking us if we need anything. I understand if he's just trying to help, but being more aware of the situation would have helped more, especially my video which captures it all. 

Now for the establishment. The place is very dusty. Holy. I have allergies to dust and I couldn't stand being in there as I had a running nose the entire time. I don't know when the last time the place was dusted or cleaned but by the looks of it, it's years. You can see the dust on the lights, the chandeliers, the wine shelf, all over!! I would be surprised if you slapped the fabric seats and a dust cloud didn't come out. 

The lighting is poor as they don't even have candles on the tables for people to see. I'm surprised this place is still open, I'm surprised how many people go and eat there. People are getting robbed of their money, and the food, and the service, the environment is not worth it. I would never come here again. Save your money. I'd rather a steak from East Side Mario's."}
{"text":"Went there last night as my husband and I were craving something Italian.  So as I often do, I Yelped Italian restaurants in our area and came up with this place.  The reviews were excellent and I would also agree with them. The food is absolutely delicious!! Like most Italian restaurants, they give you bread to start.  In my preview of the menu online, I had seen a mushroom bruschetta and was dying to try it, so we ordered that to start.  It was is/was the best bruschetta I've ever had. If you love mushrooms, cheese and bread that's crunchy and soft, then you'll love this!  For our mains, I ordered the gnocchi (Gorgonzola cheese, broccoli with rosé sauce) and my husband ordered the fettuccine with a vodka tomato sauce (shredded beef and mushrooms).  First off, the amount of food you get is very reasonable for the price.  For the first time that I can remember, my husband couldn't finish his pasta. I ate like 1/3 of my pasta and packed he rest for lunch the next day.  Secondly, the pasta is so flavourful!  The pasta was cooked to perfection!  Lastly, the service there is excellent!  They're very attentive and make wonderful recommendations.  We were also very fortunate because we got the last piece of tiramisu.  I must admit, I have had a better tiramisu elsewhere (in order: Citro - another little Italian place up near Yonge and Major Mac & Queen Margherita, the location near Jane & Annette), but this one comes in third.  Overall, I was very impressed with Santos and will definitely come back again and try the veal and the risotto."}
{"text":"The VEAL ALLA PIEMONTEZE with a side of pasta was terrific.  Same goes for the house-made tiramisu.
They were full up with reservations but they found a way to squeeze me in and I'm so thankful they did!!  
Go!  You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Santos is exceptional. Be sure to order the pasta dishes as well as the lamb since it will just melt in your mouth. The servers are very warm and friendly, and they have a very intimate dinning room. Tuesday nights they have a live jazz band playing as a bonus."}
{"text":"Out dated horrible service food was not as good it was eating at cafeteria best part of the experience was getting the bill and leaving thank goodness I was only stuck in the 80's for 40 min"}
{"text":"i had no idea this place has been around as long as it has, but after hearing this, it kind of makes sense in terms of the overall experience. I was excited to try this place out, and my anticipation only grew as it was booked up on more than one occasion. I have mixed feelings about my experience:

FOOD:

On two separate occasions I had the Penne Alla Vodka and the Penne Al Salmone. Both came in an excellent rose vodka sauce, which was just the right amount of creamy for me. There wasn't a whole lot of mushrooms or salmon in either dish, but enough to suffice. 

We had the bruschetta, which came with some of our dishes - this was not spectacular, but good overall with fresh tomato and warmed bread. Although I did not order it myself, a quick taste of the poached salmon was quite impressive, with the tender fish seemingly melting in my mouth. 

As for the dessert, the Spumoni (which came with the set meals) was literally the best I have ever had. Sure, I have not had spumoni many times in my life, but I am confident in saying that this place makes the best I've seen at least.

ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE:

Here is where I become somewhat conflicted. Sure, many restaurants become tougher to navigate once you have a newborn baby to accommodate, but this place kind of left a bad taste in my mouth given the demeanor of certain staff. 

As others have mentioned already, there is a sense that the staff here have been doing this for so long, with the restaurant popular enough that they no longer need to put much effort into customer service.

During my initial call to make reservations, I already had a sense that this place was not particularly \"baby-friendly.\" On arrival our server claimed they did not use baby chairs, only for us to see another party given one later in the evening. On this particular night (Tuesday), they had a live band, who by most standards were playing music really damn loud. It wasn't even that the loud music was irritating our baby, but the music was SO LOUD nobody at our table could even hear each other talk. Between songs I heard another table next to us also mention how loud the music was. 

Loud music in itself is not problematic, but I was turned off by one of the staff's reaction to my very friendly inquiry as to whether or not they could ask the band to turn down their speakers (which btw were quite unnecessary for a fairly small room). She cut me off and simply said \"NO...that's just the way it is,\" before walking away. Quite rude I would say. 

VERDICT:

I will probably come back, since the food is quite good, but not on a Tuesday. Hoping the quality of service improves, but as others have mentioned, the staff may have become too complacent."}
{"text":"Saw so many high reviews for this place so booked reservations for 3 people on a Saturday night to eat some Italian grub.  

When we got to the place and walked in, the place felt very fancy.  It was a bit low lit and the tables were nicely setup.  The next thing we noticed was that 85? of the patrons at the restaurant were seniors!  Not sure if it was senior night or something but it was a bit funny.  Love the seniors though!

On to the food review. We ordered mushbroom bruschetta with cheese and grilled calamari for starters.  The bruschetta was nothing special and the grilled calamari was a bit of a disappointment.  It lacked the grilled taste as if it wasn't grilled long enough and it was definitely bland.  For the mains, we all orders various pasta dishes.  I got the the portabello and chicken.  I was expecting next level pasta but to be honest, it fell short.  It tasted just like any other pasta dish at some random place.  Nothing special at all.  Where this restaurant shined in my opinion was their Tiaramisu dessert.  My wife and I ordered separate portions and I'm not much of a dessert kind of guy but I plowed through my portion in a blink of an eye.  Their Tiaramisu must have been the best I've had in awhile.

Overall, the food was edible but if you asked me if this place blew my socks off when it comes to Italian cuisine then I would have to disagree.  The service was  a bit of a disappointment too.   Not once did our waiter come by our table to check up on us throughout the evening.  They didn't even ask us for any Parmesan cheese when the pastas were served.  I had to wave them down for that one.  If I were to come back, it will not be for their Italian cuisine but strictly for their Tiaramisu!"}
{"text":"Santo's Italian Cuisine has been around for years..........years.... years........

So I guess the waiter got old, the patrons got old... and they never really renovate the place.... (yawning)

We got there around 9:15 pm on a weekday and the restaurant was empty... (yawning) aside from another table of senior couple.

Even the menu stayed the same for years.... and all the traditional Italian Comfort food can be found

Insalata alla Cesare ($7.95)
Linguine Frutti di Mare ($16.95) 
Spaghettini al Ragu ($13.95)

All A-OK! The portion is hearty and good for the price. At least my boyfriend who only order Seafood Linguine with Tomato Sauce in every single Italian Restaurant didn't complain! (yawning, honey is not you... I just had a rough day!)

Zzzzzz Zzzzzz Zzzzzzz Zzzzzzz

They also has some prix menu specials from $25.00 available Sunday-Friday. 

No Lunch Specials as they are only open dinner time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Little Italian Restraunt in the No Frills Plaza at Royal Orchard and Yonge Street. Most friendly Staff and you could not find better Bruchetta at any other Italian Restraunt. Try any of their pasta dishes and they are superb. If you are a meat dish eater, the veal is delectable. Good Wine Pairings too if you ask the Waitress. Altogether you will have a memorable evening if you try this Restraunt. There is a reason it has been there for well over 15 years. Give it a try.  Prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"Service has been amazing since I have been adding reviews.  All the comments about the service are corrected and truly a little THORNHILL gem everyone should go to when craving italian."}
{"text":"We actually came here once when they had a jazz band playing. That was our first time here. Food is good for the price. The restaurant is a bit worn out but not a big deal. (i wouldnt bring a date here)
We decided to come back again and this time totally blew it. The service was simply terrible. The older asian gentleman who was our server was completely rude. Wouldn't come to us, there was an immense amount of attitude on him and trust me, we're always happy and bubbly.
Regardless, if i wantrd to get good food, there are tons of places that do that already. When you go to a restaurant the service is half the experience and the last thing you'd expect is to be ill treated.
I had to get up and bring the pepper crusher myself. Had to get up to wave down the server since wavinf my arms seated for a whole minute was making me look like an idiot.
Any how i suggest if you like to be treated well, take your business somewhere else."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going to go for ramen but he changed his mind at the last minute and wanted Italian food instead. So I picked out this place that was close by because of the reviews. 

The first thing we noticed was how sketchy the front entrance was. But, as soon as you got inside the place was very cozy and warm. There were a lot of old couples there at 8:00pm on a Sunday night. I was surprised when I saw no children at all, mainly old people. 

It took awhile to get a seat and my boyfriend and I were starting to question whether we should find a seat ourselves. The place was pretty full so it took awhile for us to order and to get our food. However, the waitress was very nice and overall the service was great. 

Food was delicious and very hot. They served it as soon as it came out of the over, which I had no problems with. I ordered the ziti baked pasta and my boyfriend got the classic spaghetti. Overall very happy. I finally found a place to get my yummy baked pasta without having to drive up to barrie (Theos Eatery is still my favourite).

I will definitely be back again, with friends :D"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable pricing. Will definitely go back there again. Had the lamb chops and veal chop. Portions are good."}
{"text":"Never would I have thought I would find a great restaurant there. It's just so hidden and non descript. Could it be?   OMG It's a  hidden gem!!!  I love those!

Location:
It's in Thornhill in a plaza with a Food Basics and Shoppers Drug Mart

It's on the north east corner of Yonge Street and Royal Orchard Boulevard.  

Getting there:
Easy to get to, it's also a VIVA stop. If you are coming from the north on Yonge you get to turn left at a set of lights so no left turn stress. Winning. 

Parking:
 Lots of parking because of the grocery store.  Yay no parking stress, go ahead and drive yourself there my friend. :) Or drive your friends so you can pay them back for driving to all the high parking stress locations!

First impressions:
When you walk in you are met with a warm wall of delicious smells.  Garlic prevails. Thoughts :  Immediate need for garlic bread!!  It's  small foyer, there a room with a coat check, we naturally didn't notice until we left.  I'm observant like that.  :)

Decor:
The restaurant is nice, old fashioned Italian, like you see in the movies. comfortable and welcoming. Plush cushions, old Italian men waiters, white table cloths, lower ( but not too low) lighting.    I like it. 

The Crowd:
We came at 7 pm on a Saturday evening and the place was packed.  A predominately older crowd, we were the youngest in the place, and the largest party here were 10 of us, there were mostly groups of four.

Seating:
We sat at a big table at the front of the restaurant. I sat facing the outside window.  It was a booth/chair hybrid.  It was very comfortable.

Menu:
Naturally scoped out the menu online before I came. Lots of choices, apps, pasta, risotto, gnocchi, meat dishes. Not sure if its changed online but they also have a 4 course Prix fixe menu. All of us but one got that 

Bruschetta, soup or salad, list of entrees, and tiramisu or spumoni.  

I got the house salad ( the seafood chowder looked amazing), the best seafood risotto ever, and spumoni. 


The risotto had a lot of seafood. It was like they took an order of mussels and calamari and added it to an order of risotto. Not a lot of shrimp, because they were big and juicy. :) so much great food. I ate it all, my belly was bursting. 

Spumoni was a giant sundae with fruit. Ate that too. 
Delicious too. So basically everything was awesome!

Bruschetta was delicious. My friend got the mushroom Bruschetta and I got to try it. Was wonderful. 

Staff:
He was nice. 

Conclusion:
Two big thumbs up. Will be back 100%"}
