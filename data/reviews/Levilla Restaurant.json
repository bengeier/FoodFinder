{"text":"Well prepared food. Pleasantly surprised.  Decent wine list but need more stock on hand.  Need more than one bottle!!!  Entrees are good size and prepared well"}
{"text":"Visited many times. Prime Rib is a must, though somewhat overpriced. Also enjoyed the strawberry goats cheese salad. Fireplace in winter is always a welcome comfort while in their sunroom."}
{"text":"Just ate here. The food was very average and rather expensive. We waited a while for our food and when it came out it was not nearly as good as the reviews we read. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again"}
{"text":"Been here before with my wife and also the one in Signal Hill. Great food. I decided to bring my family here (5 ppl inc. 1 yr old baby). Booked table last thursday and told them we had 2 ncrowd vouchers,  everything was fine until we arrived . We were really disappointed when they told us our ncrowd vouchers no longer work and I should seek a refund. They offer us a glass of wine for our trouble. Not very happy considering we came all the way from Skyview. Was going to talk to the rest. owner Rick but we decided to go else where."}
{"text":"I'd guess the target audience for this restaurant is people would want a \"fancy\" dinner without having to go downtown. Le Villa is an expensive suburban restaurant with simultaneously upscale and comfortable decor, but food and service that is NOT commensurate. The nonsense name of the restaurant tipped me off (should start with La, not Le)...but alas, I went as it was a group function someone else planned.  Entrées are mostly in the $25-$35 range and cover the usual continental fare like stuffed chicken breasts and rack of lamb. The steak selection is the major focus of the mains and are very pricey. The rating consensus amongst the diners at our table was 6/10 for the entrées, spanning pasta, fish, chicken and beef. The only person who really enjoyed their meal found their portion size too small. Of particular note was the off-putting granular texture of the gnocchi, and that it was predominantly asparagus flavoured... despite asparagus appearing nowhere in the menu description.   An hour passed between ordering and getting our meals, which is completely unreasonable for a table of five on a weeknight. The two of us who had an appetizer (frites & lobster bisque) to somewhat tide us over found them just okay. A side order of aioli made the fries work better. At 2/3 to 1/2 the price this place would be worth going to, but not as-is. Suburbanites, please don't be duped into thinking this is fine dining. I'd rather go to Ric's Grill or Milestones, get better service and food, and save a wad of cash!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy LeVilla. They have a lot of great menu options and the ambiance is very nice too. It's a nice local restaurant that our family can visit together, but not a family restaurant so it's actually a pleasure to dine there. The prices are reasonable for the quality of dishes offered, but it's not cheap either. The one thing I think could be improved is the side dishes. It seems that almost everything on the menu comes with the same veggies and starches. I would prefer if the chef selected different items that compliment the main selection. It's not a big deal though because the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, wonderful ambiance. Sit on the enclosed patio. We come here for birthday dinners and special occasions all the time."}
{"text":"What a great place!  My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and had an amazing evening.   We had a cozy table by the fireplace,  a feast of delicious food (the rib eye was to die for) and a fantastic server,  Allison.   We will be sure to request her when we go back. She was full of personality,  had great recommendations and made sure we were taken care of.  The prices are a little high but worth the experience.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Have been to LeVilla twice. Once a couple years ago for a friend's birthday, and once last week for an anniversary dinner. The food is tasty, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is pleasant.  If you want a solid, consistent, meal with right-sized portions, then LeVilla is for you.  We dined at 6 pm, so lots of 50+ folks and grey hairs, so I will assume that the straightforward menu choices and traditional feel is attractive to this age group. If you are looking for innovative, trendy dining, you won't find it here.  Atmosphere 4/10 (no special view, etc.) Service 6/10 (a bit slow) Taste 8/10"}
{"text":"The baked Bree is amazing and honestly the only reason why they get 3 stars. The service was less than average (staff all seemed very new or poorly trained) and entrees were very overpriced. The gnocchi tasted frozen and the chicken was chewy. $90 for one appetizer and two subpar entrees. Not impressed."}
{"text":"It was good. The service was good. Tables alittle too close for comfort. Was it value for the money? No. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I expect something special or at least unusual when I have to pay more than $30 for an entree but I'm not impressed when it's for a pork chop potatoes and carrots.  It's too safe a menu for the price."}
{"text":"It was my first time here.  So very glad we came.  The food was incredible.  I had the steak and it was done to perfection.  The waitress, Amanda, was fantastic at recommending a great wine.  The service here was very, very good.  I loved this place and will defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"It was really good!  I ordered the set dinner.  1st: Pear Salad - Really good, light, fresh vegetables, dressing was made of what tasted like orange juice and black pepper.  2nd: Lobster Thermidor - I've never had this before in my life, but it was a baked lobster tail with cheese and egg yolks.   3rd: Rack of Lamb - Lamb was cooked perfectly.  All sides tasted great (mashed potatoes + vegetables).  4th: Berry Crepes - Crepes were rolled with wildberry sauce, vanilla ice cream and custard.  Pretty decent portion for the dessert.  Overall great experience, just a bit on the pricey side based on the small portions, otherwise it'd get 5 stars."}
{"text":"We've been to Levilla a few times and always enjoy everything about the place.  The food is very good and the atmosphere enhances the whole experience.  The lamb is so good that I just can't seem to talk myself into ordering anything else but my husband always enjoys his choice, which is usually a steak.  Appetizers never disappoint either.  Update - we went to Levilla for lunch yesterday (Feb. 11/10) and left the restaurant totally full and happy.  Now,  if you're looking for an inexpensive lunch, this is not the place to go.  If you're looking to get what you pay for then this IS the place to go.    My lobster ravioli with cream sauce came out with three beautiful, plump shrimp nestled on top ($22).  The dish was so good!  I made it through about two thirds of the portion and only managed to do that because it tasted so darn good that I couldn't quit eating it.  We did manage to eat the remainder way too late in the evening but what can you do?  It's not really my fault because my husband said, \"Isn't there some of your lunch left?\" and next thing you know, it was heated and we were savoring every bite.  My husband ordered one of the lunch specials, which was a salad with mandarin oranges and a terriyaki marinated sirloin, and it, too, was super good.  The beef was so tender and flavorful.    The server told us that the restaurant cuts their own steaks and uses only the finest quality of beef and that sure was evident in that salad steak.   And, speaking of the server, she was very professional.  She even brewed us a fresh pot of decaf with no problem when asked to do so.  She never interrupted us once but instead picked the right moments to check on us.  The whole experience made us want to return soon."}
{"text":"A little bit expensive for my usual low brow tastes That being said they are quiet delicious and have a wonderfully decadent atmosphere. They also have a thing.. its like a super fancy tater tot (?) Im told its called a croquette. and those are pretty dang awesome."}
{"text":"A little bit out of the way, but a fantastic place for dinner.  I'll second some of the reviews from Orpha and Vic--Levilla has a wonderful atmosphere and friendly service, and there's really not a bad entree to be had, with lamb and steaks being particularly well done.  Prices are reasonable for a steakhouse of this caliber, and there's a good number of reasonably priced quality wines, as well."}
{"text":"This is for the 1800 4 st SW location, since I cant find it on Yelp, and will apply to them all, as it's another 'branch' of the same restaurant.  Okay, just googled it. The one on the address above has gone out of business this month, or, at very least, have left the building (rented out by Strategic Corp)  Frankly, this chain was never even in the running, as was knocked out of contention by Calgary's odd restaurant habit of ambitious pricing. I'm only getting around to reviewing the above location now, but around $80 for a 2 course steak meal!? Come on!   Even on Fridays and Saturdays, the place was never busy, and had odd opening times, one couldnt even tell WHEN they were open looking from the outside!  You remember the building right? The location appears to be cursed. The old 'BLVD' bar? The 'BLVD' bar that was promptly shut down for reasons you can google for yourself. Then, 'Tilted Grill' - (see my other review) that came and went rapidly. Now LeVilla has the same fate.   It's ambitious pricing certainly killed the 1800 4 st location, helping it along?Maybe also the poor location, possibly sky high rent from Strategic (the landlord), the collapse of the tar sands or a combination of all, I'm looking forward to a business opening in that location that I can actually go into without having to take out a loan."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and it was decent but not great.   Atmosphere is fantastic with open kitchen concept and the staff were super friendly. Enjoyed the choice of still water or sparkling at no cost.   Menu choice and drink selection is above average with lots of variety.   Shared Pot stickers (4 pieces?? but delicious) and Caesar Salad (was well made and not over dressed) Main entree was 10 oz NY Strip loin with vegetables and Yam fries (excellent).   Dessert was the chocolate molten with ice cream but was told 15 minutes to cook and was underwhelming which kept it from 4 stars.   Overall great place to go with friends or a special night out and pricing was spot on."}
{"text":"We have been here few times already; they can accommodate larger group of people and kids friendly too; the food is just perfect, service is outstanding, atmosphere is great; it is just on the higher side for the pricing but you will get what you pay for; the food quality had always been the same; desserts are fantastic; will definitely recommend and will repeat."}
{"text":"Went there with two friends. We all ordered different meals and drinks. Everything was delicious. The wine was reasonably priced and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. The staff was great."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this.  I did not find the prices out of line for a restaurant such as this.  The food was delicious and well seasoned.  I loved the atmosphere. Friendly and cozy.  I went with a group, for lunch and it was not all that busy.  I'll gladly return."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Oh my gosh! This place has mouth watering everything. From the butternut squash soup I started with to the lobster tail meal to my hubby's ribeye steak dinner- we loved it all. The drinks were delicious too. The service was slowwww, so make sure you have lots of time...but our server was amazing. She apologized for coming to us late and paid for the first round of drinks. I was so happy with this place. The rustic but cozy interior make you feel like you're all the way in the mountains too.  Very well done people of La Villa."}
{"text":"We chose this place for our wedding anniversary. First impression when we entered was that it had a nice ambiance. The menu choices were an excellent variety offering several fish and steak cuts as well as other choices you'd only expect at a higher end restaurant. The wine choices were excellent and they even had our favourite wine.   So why the single star?   We felt quite rushed from the moment we sat down. We had barely even had a chance to look at the menu when we were asked twice if we were ready to order and pick our drink choices.   My wife chose the Caesar salad to start and I chose the lobster bisque. I realize less is more and that many high end restaurants serve smaller portions, but they also use higher end flavourful ingredients. The salad was a couple standard lettuce chunks with a few bacon bits and parmesan cheese and capers with two croutons. Something similar to a bagged salad. The soup wasn't really flavourful. More bland rosè than lobster tasting.   The wine we chose we love. The issue was it was served slightly above room temperature.   Main course, my wife chose the halibut. It resembled one of those frozen vacuum packed fillets in a bag of fish fillets you buy from Costco. Seemed over cooked or cooked from a fillet frozen too long with two small shrimp, one carrot, one piece of broccoli l, one piece of cauliflower and a couple mini potatoes for $36.   I had the bison short rib. Which I didn't mind actually.   We skipped desert.   We wouldn't choose to come back here. For the price and quality there are several large chain restaurants that can dish out similar mass produced dishes at a lower end price."}
{"text":"Le Villa is a class restaurant in SW Calgary, the food is great and best of all it's big enough to be comfortable for big groups.  It's also romantic and chic enough for a date night. Very cozy, and classy environment, the service was good, the staff were clearly professional and  It's not cheap but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This was the worst halibut that I have ever had. I always order fish when I go out and have never been this disappointed! Flat, dry and over cooked. It didn't look or even taste like halibut. However our server (forget her name was awesome) she did take it off our bill so I give them credit for that, but management didn't seem concerned since they didn't bother to come and talk to us. Also the chairs are in need of replacement so uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant and it probably won't be my last time.  The restaurant is split into two areas: 1. Lounge area: slightly dark but perfect if you want to drink some scotch; and 2. Atrium area: feels like you're dining in the garden - large windows that face a green area. I'd recommend requesting to be seated in the second area - it'd be an ideal place for a romantic date.  Service was great. The server was extremely attentive and always anticipated what I needed.  In terms of the food, menu has a good selection but leans more heavily towards the meat side. I guess that makes sense since they were rated as a good steakhouse previously. Appetizers, such as the baked brie (served with a sweet and tangy fruit sauce) and parmesan frites, were great and perfect for sharing. Entrees were also good - I had the trout but my table mates had steak and also mentioned that the meat was tender.  If you're looking for a fancier place near signal hill, check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with my parents.  Even Sunday night, the earliest reservation we could get was 8pm because the place was PACKED!  Had the set dinner and all three of us were pleasantly surprised:  Starter:  Clam Chowder or Lobster Bisque  Both were excellent.  Lobster Bisque was traditional creamy, and heavy, and a very generous portion.  Clam Chowder was full of clams and chunky potatoes.  Second:  Coquille St. Jacques or Thai Shrimp  BOTH great again!  The Coquille St. Jacques was very creamy and filling.  Thai Shrimp was super crunchy and very spicy and just wonderfully prepared.  Main: Tenderloin Steak, Duck Breast, or Snapper Fillet  The Tenderloin was fantastic: really tender and flavorful with filling sides and great veggies.  Duck, I felt was a little tough, and I was a bit disappointed by this.  The skin should be crispy, and the meat should melt in your mouth, but this was not the case.  The sides were great, but the duck would be the weakest link in this meal.  Didn't have the Snapper at our table.  Dessert:   Cappucino Creme Brulee - oh my.  So tasty.  Not too sweet, and enough espresso infused flavor to balance the hard sugar caramel layer on top.  Super smooth, super delicious.  Raspberry Chocolate Mousse - lighter than most mousses I've had, but still delicious, as the fruit flavor is sweet and natural tasting (real fruit tasting not flavoring) and the chocolate is bitter sweet to perfectly offset the raspberry part.  All in all, my parents, who normally NEVER like anything other than Chinese food, raved.  And they never do that.  My father finished EVERY course - practically licked the plate.  For $39 for 4 courses, (I couldn't even finish 3 of 4 because of the generous portions and rich flavors), it's a great deal.  The only thing I personally would have preferred, is a course that's lighter, like a salad, or more salad/raw in the dish to balance out how HEAVY the meal is; I was so full I kind of felt like throwing up at one point.  If the regular ala cart entrees are as good, then I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"My friend is back in town visiting from Australia, she is staying with her mum who lives in Valley Ridge, where the only thing nearby for eating is a Dennys. After a quick Yelp search for some sort of decent eats, I found LeVilla was only a 15 min drive away. Seriously Valley Ridge, WTF.  We had a very nice time at LeVilla, the restaurant space is very beautiful, the kitchen is open and the walls are adorned in large round stones. It was quite cozy given the frigid temperatures outside. Our table was in the sunroom/atrium. I am not really sure how to describe it, there is a fireplace in here and windows that were covered in snow. They did an amazing job keeping the place warm though considering all the glass in this room. I had a space heater set-up behind my chair.  Our waitress was prompt in the beginning and very polite, we ordered a bottle of wine for the table and my fiancé ordered a beer. She came back with the wine, but was out of the beer he had ordered. Our waitress had gone ahead and selected another beer (that was nothing like the beer he ordered) for him to try. He hates making a fuss, so accepted the proffered beer anyways. She then told us the soup of the day, roasted tomato/basil. I was having a hard time deciding, their menu has lots of fantastic options on it; so we told her to come back in a few minutes.  She came back and my fiancé ordered the ginger beef pot stickers, which they were also out of. It would have been nice if she had mentioned that they were out of certain items when she told us the soup of the day. So three of us ordered the feature soup and there was also baked brie and parmesan frites to be had. Mains consisted of gnocchi, salmon, halibut and the duck.  The good: parmesan frites, the duck The average: baked brie, salmon, gnocchi, halibut The bad: the feature soup wasn't very warm and was surprisingly bland. I would rather pay $6 bucks and have the tomato bisque soup from Safeway than the $8 per bowl of this disappointment with a spoon.  We ventured forth to dessert, and the creme brulee and the pecan pie were both respectively, very nice.  We had a pleasant time, the ambience was lovely, food was enjoyable, service was fine. I will probably be back if I need a spot to enjoy a bite in that area."}
