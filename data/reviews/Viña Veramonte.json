{"text":"We had an enjoyable, personal, brief tour of the vineyard and a wine tasting with food pairing.  Our tour guide, Natalie, was outstanding.  Very knowledgeable and considerate.  We enjoyed the Savignon Blanc and Carmenere (a smooth, red variety). The location is close to the main highway between Santiago and Vina del Mar / Valparaiso.   The modern building and grounds are impressive."}
{"text":"We had a nice tasting experience here. It's classy and has beautiful grounds. It was very formal, and informative. Nice little store. They own Quintessa!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door, we were treated with only kindness! There were 2 ladies that did the tasting with us, and the first is who helped describe to us all the tasting and tour options.   As for the wine itself- absolutely exquisite. I was impressed with everything from the ros√© to the blend (we tasted the Ritual line)   Overall I would highly recommend this winery to any travelers! But be careful, you'll end up buying too much wine at the end- it's that good! Very excited to fly home with 4 bottles of delicious Chilean wine."}
{"text":"Beautiful and large.  This was a wonderful place and we were greeted with nothing but respect and service.  The location is beautiful and lovely for taking photos and walking around.  There are lotus flowers in front along with some amazing palm trees and vines.  It's just beautiful.  When you enter the building, it is big and you are immediately greeted personally.  The employee explained what the tasting options are and sat down for a small tasting.  The employees served everything up before sitting down with us to go over how to taste the wines and what to expect.  Then we were invited to follow along with the process as he asked us questions about what we were tasting.  He was very knowledgeable. The wine was lovely and there was a little coffee bar too on the other side if the building.  There were also trinkets and other associated wines for sale.  Lovely lovely location.  Lovely wines."}
{"text":"I believe the cafe/restaurant opened Nov 2015. It was minimalist, but so tasty. We had a soup tasting that came with multigrain bread, and cheese empanadas - the local ingredients were flavorful, bright. We topped up with freshly brewed espresso.   The glass of white wine we tried was okay. Not particularly memorable.  They carried Orin Swift, which I found amusing."}
