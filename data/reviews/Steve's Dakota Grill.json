{"text":"We have been to SDG about 5 times now and have found the food & service to be very good.  I'm not going to do as some of the others and comment on the rest of the patrons, what do they have to do with the QUALITY of the FOOD or the SERVICE? My steaks have always been good, the portions large, and the server has seemed  genuinely concerned that I was happy.  Also, why would I visit a place \"several times\" and then decide it's a disappointment?  If I keep going back, obviously I believe it to be good.     A few pointers: If you can't take animal heads up on the wall, don't go.   You probably don't want to take an overly sensitive vegetarian to Steve's.   Don't eat half of your dinner and then complain that it's \"not done right.\"   If you don't like waiting, don't wait and then complain that you had to.  Go with a light heart, people you love, and enjoy the food & atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wonderful ! Words and pictures do not cut it . It is a must see for yourself experience! Wonderful quality drinks an prices . always fresh features ! Go! - note weekends are always busy try during the week for a more intimate experience"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 10+ times visiting family and I've had better but for the price you cannot beat this place.  I've eaten at places in Vegas and New York that cost 3x as much that don't compare to the food at Steve Dakota's.  their filets are always great and I've never had bad crab or scallops here either.  I tried the sirloin once and would never do that again.  Overall great food and great drinks and inexpensive for what you get."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem. A true culinary delight. Additionally, we had the best time at Steve Dakotas Grill. The food was delicious and the service was great! They had a great wine selection too. All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"We had received a gift card to Steve's for Christmas.  I called the restaurant before going to verify hours, reservation requests, etc.  I was surprised to hear them answer \"Timber Lodge\".  They proceeded to tell me they had changed names and would honor my gift card.  So on 4/18/2013 we went to Timber Lodge for dinner....and were pleasantly surprised.  The service was excellent.  We each had the Fillet Mignon which came with a delicious, fresh salad and a huge baked potato.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  We shard the carrot cake for dessert.  Yummm!  It was so moist.  The only downside was we were sat in a booth near the bar (could not see it, but certainly heard it).  The place was not very busy but one of the bar customers was quite loud and cursed excessively.  He seemed to be a regular.  I was surprised that management didn't ask him to quiet down a bit.  We didn't say anything as we were nearly done with our dinner.  Two dinners and 1 dessert, no drinks...came to $62."}
{"text":"Pretty good grub... come hungry the portions are sizable."}
{"text":"The waitress warned me that the Pinot Noir was \"lite\", but the bottle I bought taste like a blend with water. It was a Modesto wine, basically a six dollar bottle at Wal-Mart. However, I did taste it first and could have sent it back. I decided to keep it. The prime rib was great, but never saw a piece of bread, on a positive note, maybe they had ESP and knew my wife is \"gluten intolerant\" . I guess I was wondering why the bottles of olive oil were on the table if not for bread?   I would have preferred real horse radish, their cream blend was too weak.   We were prompted to try Steve's from a coupon in the Medina Post. Unfortunately there were absolutely no extras that would come with a normal dinner. I'm no cheap-skate, waitresses always get above 20 percent. Just don't treat me second class, I get enough of that from politicians. Steve's parking lot wasn't packed, they could use more business, I'd suggest don't skimp on \"intro\" deals. I may come back, but more than likely would go to an \"Outback\" if I had a choice."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  it out of the way but so worth the trip!  Took my father on Sunday afternoon.  We both enjoyed our meals in very nice dining room.    We had the Mussels for an appetizer that was on special that day.  Again perfectly prepared . . . the garlic butter they were prepared in was flavorful and ideal for dipping our hot bread into as Mandy recommended.    For the entree, I had the Flat Iron Steak Masala which was excellent . . . added blue cheese crumbles which was melted on top.  Dad had the prime rib.  Both meals when they came our initially were a little undercooked.  However, our waitress, Mandy, was eager to please and didn't hesitate to return the meals to the kitchen.  The second time out they were perfect!    You can sample wine at a nominal cost and the tall beers are really TALL!  Definitely a find and a place I look forward to returning to again and again!"}
{"text":"My Steak Was really good and the service was good as well! A little bit of a wait but it was well worth it! Id def come back again. A little loud though"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Steve's often and I am shocked at some of the reviews I'm seeing. We've always had exceptional service, and the food is outstanding. Our bill is usually $150+ but it is well worth it. We usually get the filet mignon and lobster tail. The lobster tail is extremely large, and could be the main course by itself, and is melt-in-your mouth tender. Our normal server is Amanda and she is awesome. I have to wonder if some of the reviewers actually dined at Steve's. On the weekend, you can usually expect a 1.5 hour wait. That alone speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Have been to Steve's many times since it opened..  The first several times were the best. We had gotten used to \"no reservations\" so that hadn't been an issue. Restaurants in rural Medina are limited and Steve's had always fit the bill for large and small parties. Last Christmas Eve (2011) we decided to start a new tradition and eat there before church.  We thought we went early enough at 6pm but had an hour wait.  The bar offered a good alternative. This year we went an hour earlier (5pm) to compensate. We were told 45 min (with a possible up to 60 min) wait. At an hour and 15 minutes we asked how much longer.  \"Three in front of you\" I was assured by the surly host.  He was rude, laughed in my face and seemed to take delight in making a scene.  When I asked about those coming in and being seated immediately, he said they took  \"some\" reservations. It appears that this year \"some\" reservations were allowed.  That is, if you happened to call in, you were given a reservation. When you arrived, you were given the next available table no matter how long anyone else had been waiting. It doesn't seem smart business let alone fair. With the holiday, and extremely crowded areas, we were pretty much stuck. After an hour and 45 minute wait, my husband explained that if we had been told the wait would be that long when we arrived, we would have options.  At this late hour (and again, being Christmas Eve) we were left with few choices. We were finally seated after one hour and 55 minutes.  The waitress (Sarah) was great and the food was good. At 7:45p we were waiting for our check.  At 8:00pm we were told that the computer was down and we had to wait for it to come up, to get our check printed out. I guess the attitude of the host was what made the experience so awful.  He doesn't appear to know the first thing about customer service and after  reading the other reviews, our situation wasn't unique. We won't be back.  I guess there are enough people in the area to keep the business going and he realizes it. It's too bad someone doesn't give him some competition. It wouldn't take much.  Good chef, pleasant atmosphere, cheerful front desk personality. I am sure many people would love to take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"What the hay, I went with 5 stars.  Why not?   Steve's is a great place to go with friends, or on a date like I did.  I'm not sure a first date though considering the animal heads on the wall.  Normally I would be horrified and never eat at an establishment that stuffs animal heads and mounts them over your table, but for some reason I didn't mind at Steve's.  It wasn't tacky or disturbing.  Kinda made for a nice atmosphere.   I had the flat iron steak with a marsala sauce.  Excellent.  My medium was a little underdone than expected, but tasted yummy despite. The brownie dessert was unbelievably huge.    I liked that there is a description of all the steaks on the table.  I did not like that the menus are plastic and already on the table.  They give out some really nice fancy wine menus, but not regular ones.  That's my only complaint though.  Not bad."}
{"text":"My mother and I both had the chicken marsala. The baked potatos were good and so were the house salad. The chicken marsala sauce was not that good, my mother and I said it had a funny taste to it! Plus we talked to another coupe and they said the prime rib was extremly rare when they asked for medium. Ah well- maybe it was just an off night because this place was always packed!"}
{"text":"My Husband & I went to this restaurant more then once. I ordered the top of the line PRIME RIB DINNER w/ all the fixings. The meat was AWFUL. FATTY,COLD,UNCHEWABLE,GROSS LOOKING. I sent this meat back 3 times. Each time it came back worse. I was not able to locate a manager there when we were there. The third time that the meat came back the cook gave me some of the au jus that went along with it to make it hotter. I was THOROUGHLY HIGHLY TICKED OFF WITH THIS TREATMENT FROM THE COOK,WAITRESS & THIS WHOLE DAGGONE RESTAURANT. We will never ever go back there again as long as I live.  I hope that you don't waste your money on this dump. I hated all their food there. My husband got a FILET MIGNON. His was cold & bad also. Sent it back & got another one that wasn't much better. We have had good food there before but not the last times that we were there. I know each person has their own opinion on this but, the DRINKS AT THE BAR WERE LOUSY. The bar maid did not knkow how to make a DAIQUIRI, OR A MARGARITA correctly. Both of these drinks came back where I could not taste the booze, & she filled the glasses so full that she spilled most of it on the floor like a DUMMY. I hate this place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kind of a different place.  It is old lodge style building.  They do not take reservations on Fri & Sat.  We have eat here before and fits into the Goldilocks mode.  Everything is just right.  Well maybe more like good but not outstanding.  We have a new angle on the place by going striaght to Bone-In Ribeye and Porterhouse.  The 23oz Ribeye was about 2\" thick and done perfectly rare in center and tending to medium on outside.  It had all kinds of juice and the fat was in chunks not strung thru it.  It really could have been cut with butter knife.  The grill Asparagus was awesome.  The porterhouse was also cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  at 20oz it can also make for a second take home meal.  The orginal idea was 15.99 lobster instead of porterhouse, and the 15.99 lobster is a 24.99 meal (tater and salad).  They are live, well when you order they are.  So you can see your food swimming if you wish.  But they do not crack lobster for you.  The prime rib has been previous meal here.  The problem is I really can not remember if it was good or average (Goldilocks situtation), but it was obviously not great or horrible.  They have a good assortment of seafood (walleye, salmon,scrod, crab legs...) They also have ribs, and I have heard they are good but never got pass the red meat part of a \"grill\" menu. Should be rated 3&1/2 stars but since that is not an option, three it is"}
{"text":"Head's Up, Timber Lodge aka Pine Tree Inn!  I read that although this is ONLY a new name to Steve's Dakota Grill, I also read that they kept the former chefs and restaurant management.  BE WARNED that means if you see the \"For Hiring\" sign is constantly out front, it means that the same BAD COOKING HABITS of the kitchen manager still are there.  It also means that the new people they bring on aboard see the disgusting nature of the Kitchen and what goes on with people's food.  I guarantee you that means the Kitchen Manger is still putting his licked fingers in people's steaks and other food before it gets served.  How disgusting!  Why doesn't the Health Department do something about the managers here?  Do not go here during Shift Change either.  YOU ARE TOTALLY IGNORED!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been hit or miss for us.  We have yet to have an evening without incident, whether it be a power outage, ill-prepared steak (sent back twice), or an incorrigible manager.  The last time we went, our server (Amanda) and meals were practically perfect in every way.  I still can't get over the size of their sweet potatoes, and the salmon was sauced and grilled exactly right.  Really, wonderful.  Frustration came when we tried to use a gift card to pay for half our bill.    From what we were told, they'd updated their gift card reader and we had an old card.  It wasn't old to us, but was old to their machine.  The machine was unable to read it, so we were stuck paying the full amount on our own.  Due to our history with this place, we only came because of the gift card.  When we explained this to the manager (Ron Levitt), he became impatient and rude with us.  I think if I were the manager of a nice restaurant, I would do my best to avoid the bar while on my shift (he smelled like beer), and treat each customer as if they were family.  When we realized we were getting nowhere with this man, he thrust his business card at us, as if that was supposed to make us feel better.  We have money for this place that we can't use, and he didn't even offer to remedy the situation other than wanting to argue with us.  At the very least, he could have taken our conversation somewhere other than the main entrance.  It was an uncomfortable scene.  The third star is for Amanda and our one night of amazing dinners, otherwise two stars."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant for date night.  We love the food and the service is always great.  We tried taking the kids one time and we would never do that again.  It is a restaurant mainly for adults...another reason we love it on date night."}
{"text":"Last night was my 5th (and final) visit to Steve's.  They do not take reservations on Saturday so we had an hour wait.  Getting a drink at the bar is always a hassle while waiting for a table because the bar seats are always filled with locals slugging down Bud light and talking (very loudly) about the latest innovations in tractors and such.  And btw - the place is LOUD - the gigantic man and his wife (dressed in matching cammo sweatshirts) assumed we cared about the kids as the new truck.  When we were seated, the server pointed to a pile of dog eared - dirty old menus that look like they belong in a Denny's counter - not at a restaurant claiming to be a steak and seafood hotspot.  There were 7 of us and dinners were brought out a little at a time - total time from plate 1 to plate 7 was almost 10 minutes - so we all sat there watching our food get cold while we waited for the final guest to receive her dinner.  We asked 3 people where the final plate was and all three barked at us that it was coming soon.  I had shrimp that looked and tasted as if it was purchased at GFS and the flavorless, football sized baked potatoes were obviously grown on the property of a nuclear power plant.  My daughter ordered a medium well done steak that was brought out rare and cold.  When the server finally came back to check on us everyone was finished with their meals and my daughter sat with a raw cold steak.  I told the server and she offered to \"either throw it on the grill for a bit or box it up\" to take it home (and feed it to the neighbor's dog I guess.  I asked that it simply be taken off of the bill and she left to discuss this incredibly complicated request with the manager and owner.  When she returned I was told that since my daughter ate her salad they would give us half off of her meal and I asked to see the manager.  She came back as told me that she spoke to the manager and the owner - as she described him - \"the heavyset guy by the door\" and they said no that the best they could do was offer half of of her meal.  Neither the owner or the manager found the time in their busy schedules to visit our table even though I asked - nicely.  So I paid and tipped my 20% as I don't feel as though the fact the place is run like a ponderosa steak house was her fault.  But I did walk up front to see the manager or owner both of whom apparently disappeared and no one could seem to find them.  The bottom line - it's a so-so place pretending to be something worthy of the prices deserved by actual steakhouses with professional wait/bar/management staff.  If you like a place with witty (or so these people think) signs hanging everywhere with sayings about not putting your butts in the urinal and other classy rural gems and food on par with the Golden Corral - then this is your place.  If you want actual quality meals and professional staffs - head south a few more miles to the Main Street or some of the other places in Medina.  NE Ohio is home to some FANTASTIC places to eat - Steve's Dakota is NOT one of them - they could be - but they don't care to be more than what they are..."}
{"text":"Steve's Dakota Grille is a disappointment. I've been to the restaurant several times, and each time I am reminded NOT to return. I clearly have a problem remembering this. Fellow yelpers, please intervene if you ever see me check in at this restaurant again.  On my last visit, I had the surf and turf as a post Valentine dinner, my girlfriend had the same. (Surf and turf is generally the price for blowing off buying flowers on V-Day, another lesson learned).   This restaurant has potential and a consistent crowd. The decor and ambiance is strange. The interior is similar to a rustic cabin in the woods. Lots of blonde wood, animal heads mounted on the wall, antler chandeliers, etc. You get the feeling that they are going to hand you a rifle to hunt for game in the back lot and drag it to the kitchen.   Then you check out the bar (small) with a nice wine list and high end spirits. Wait, is this upscale?  Then you are seated at a butcher paper covered table. Our waitress promptly arrived and wrote her name on the butcher paper in crayon. Wait, is this Macaroni Grille?  We sifted through the laminated menu. Wait, are we at Buffalo Wild Wings?  I should have stopped there. But I was already in trouble. Surf and turf it is. The filet mignon was cooked properly, but not seasoned well. It just tasted bland. The lobster tail was served piggybacked. It was overcooked and dry. Clearly the tail had been frozen.  Worst case I paid way too much for a GFS piggyback frozen lobster tail. I have my suspicions. The garlic mashers, just plain ok.   The dinner was expensive. The overall quality of the food was poor.   On the bright side, you are safe to have a drink here. There is a good selection, and the prices weren't that bad. Also, the service was pretty good.   Flowers next year. Definitely."}
