{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Cancelled my reservation even though I had booked 10 days ago. 5 different people called giving me different excuses and/ or accusing me of being wrong about my 8pm reservation that I have email proof for.  Left a bad review on instagram and instantly I had my reservation back. That is not cool! I am now left scrambling to find a new reservation for my birthday.  I was hopeful and excited for this great concept, too bad I didn't even get to try it."}
{"text":"Long story short: bad service, tiny overpriced tacos that come out cold, charges for TAP water in dirty  lipstick stained glasses, charges for hot sauce that was not even hot sauce ($2.50) without warning.  My FIRST ever bad review..  ..but it was that bad. We have wanted to try this place so we did a walk-in at 8:10 and was told we would have to leave at 9 for a reservation. We did not have a problem with that.  However, we were given 2 dirty glasses with lipstick and fingerprints and we asked her for a new one, which she never did. 18 minutes til we had to go, she comes up to us and says \"did you eat your tacos or no\". We did not get them yet.  She gets a rushed order for us and out comes 4 tacos that are tiny, cold, salty, simply not worth $5 each. Mind you, we both have great jobs, we are nowhere close to cheap. These were just so unreasonable. As the other two tacos come out we have 10 minutes left until 9 and she gives us the bill and notices that we didnt even know we were getting charged for the sauce OR tap water and does not say a word. We still tipped, but that was horrible service and just okay cold and dry food.  The seated neighbours were also complaining about their experience as we sat down but I thought it would of been minor.   Taco joint with no hot sauce unless you pay 2.5 dollars for a creamy sauce with a \"kick\". Really want to give this place another chance because we enjoy Cleaver, but man that was disappointing af.  Only okay thing was that the drinks were decent."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst \"Mexican/Tex Mex/whatever\" I have ever had. Actually it is probably one of the worst meals I have ever had.  We had the queso to start. Bland and salty. The worst offense was dumping Cheetos in there. It looked like a very poor man Guy Fieri concoction. Awful.  Had the prawn skewers after that. Again bland and salty. The \"to die for\" fried soft shell was tasteless.  The tacos were not much better. The duck one was way too sweet, the spiced pork one way too over spiced, and the cauliflower one had a pile of that disgusting queso poured all over. I felt like garbage all night.  Lastly, the service. Young guy. Liked to get in close and give suggestions. All were terrible. Dude made me uncomfortable every time he came by. I get it is noisy but don't get right up against me and start flipping my menu with your super gross mannerisms. You come off disingenuousness.  TLDR; The very poor Guy Fieri imitation restaurant fails at every level. Pro Tip: Go to Native Tongues."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant for with a few things that threw me off. Firstly, the Mojito drink was amazing, so a great job on that. Next was the Queso Fundido was great, but I underestimated how filing this plate is, but I find the tortilla chips to be on the salty side (they added salt). If you love cheese with a mix of different taste & textures, then this one is for you to try. The yam fries were also amazing and a fair priced menu item along with their Habanero mayo.   Lastly the tacos, unfortunately, it took a long time before we got our order for this as the kitchen staff was lagging behind. The flow of order from finishing the order to the final check took way longer than what was needed (We were sitting at the kitchen bar & staring at our food order). By the time we received the tacos, the food was already cold, and it ruined some of my first impressions. My favorite taco flavors are Crispy Duck, Crispy Pork Belly, and the Fried Shrimp.  Also, I was slapped with a $2.00 water fee on my bill which ticked me a bit, but we had to go since it took longer than we anticipated at the establishment. As much as I like the atmosphere, design, and ambiance of this place. I may or may not come back, depending on my mood."}
{"text":"Everything is really good and even better if you make it to their happy hour. $3.50 tacos and $6 drinks.. how can you wrong. I would strongly suggest making reservations, as this place is smaller and it fills up quick.   You must try the Cheeseburger tacos!!  You should also try the mS14 ( I think that's what It was called) Fries, it was saucy and had a little bit of a kick to it.   On the Money was my drink of choice of the night , I love mint."}
{"text":"Loved it! We showed up without a reservation and did have to wait an hour but it was worth the wait. It was quite cozy as it's a small space, and I wasn't a huge fan of the attitude of the gentleman at the door as he wasn't super welcoming however it was extremely busy, and the rest of our experience made up for the cold welcome.  Our server was friendly, fun and welcoming, as was the one who brought the drinks to our table, they both had plenty of suggestions and enthusiasm for the menus. We tried a few different cocktails which we enjoyed and the tacos were fantastic. Small but the taco menu was obviously designed so you can mix and match and still enjoy an entree. We also had the ribs and the pork shoulder and all the meat was flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth. Very excited to come and check out more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with some girlfriends for our dinner club. I was able to make a reservation thru OpenTable and took advantage of happy hour before 7pm on a Monday night. $2.50 all taco except shrimp and steak which was $4 and all cocktails $6. Overall the service was great and our waitress was able to split out our bills and everything was correct on the bill which was awesome because we ordered a bunch of stuff at different times. I got the lol Tramposo cocktail and it was really good. I recommend the beer battered fish taco and atole fried chicken taco which were my favourites. The crispy pork belly was not a crispy as I would like but still good. My least favourite was the mushroom. Others in the group said cheeseburger was their favorite. The chorizo queso was nothing amazing and I found it kinda bland, not worth the $16.  My friends got the Nutella filled dough balIs and said it was ok. I got really full from all the tacos and would say I tapped out at 5. I would save room and try other items next time."}
{"text":"Don't get the pork belly tacos. They're so delicious that you won't be able to think of anything else. Definitely don't go to happy hour. You'll want to go everyday and it'll ruin your social life. (Although maybe get new friends because who doesn't love $3.50 tacos and cheap cocktails?!)  Speaking of $3.50 tacos... it's not that serious, reviewers. Have a Mexican Low Rider. Or maybe you need a Spicy Little Tart. Either way it's got to be said. Betch, please, lighten up."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night a few weeks back and got a table for 3 right away which was great! We probably sat for a good 15 minutes before we were approached by our server. Then another 15 before our order was taken. We ordered guacamole and 9 tacos altogether. The guacamole took close to an hour to come out which is pretty outrageous and our tacos probably a little over an hour. I would understand if it was super busy but it was around 830-9 when we came in and it seemed like all the tables were either eating or finished eating. When we finally got our food, we found a piece of long hair wrapped around a piece of meat which was very offputting. I tried to bring it to our server's attention but couldn't find her anywhere so I had to flag down another server and she said \"sorry\" without even hearing what I had to say and went to continue serving food. I finally got the attention of the hostess and she brought it to the kitchen and they happened to remake it in 30 seconds. We didn't really feel like eating after that. We got our bill and although they aren't obligated to, I felt like the taco with the hair should've at least been comp'd but it wasn't and we still ended up paying for it. All in all, I don't plan on returning anytime soon. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"My review comes with a proviso: I didn't actually eat there. I booked a table for 2 and arrived on time only to be told that they only had bar seating.  When I told the hostess that I had reserved a table, she simply told me that they didn't have that on their system. This wouldn't have been so bad, but the hostess really didn't seem to care... basically a take it or leave it kind of deal.   I would have appreciated at least some attempt to accommodate us.  Barring that, she could have shown some sympathy. But nothing!  So we left and went next door to Cleaver, where we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"My first ever review because this place is absolutely terrible.  - Asked for my reservation when I got there (booked on Open Table) which was \"cancelled\", thus voiding my Open Table points - Ordered the beet salad, MS14 fires, and tacos; tacos came first, salad about 10 minutes later, and the fries took about forever and a decade - Could barely get our server's attention; she never checked in to see how we were doing or how the food was, didn't refill our waters (which you have to pay for), or give an ETA on the rest of the meal - We had to flag down a nearby hostess to ask where our fries were 30-40 minutes after the rest of the meal had arrived, who had to fetch our waitress for us - Commented on the extremely spicy beet salad (which was not indicated anywhere on the menu ... jalapeno as an addition to a salad does not translate to 'burn your mouth off hot' to me) and received zero explanation except for, \"yeah it has a bit of a kick\" - We could see her fire off a rush order for the fries because the kitchen/our waitress had both clearly forgotten - Zero apologies for the wait, combined with a standoffish attitude cement my position on never coming back here  All in all, extremely disappointing considering that their sister resto/neighbour Cleaver is amazing.  EDIT: Guest and I also now both feel under the weather and the only common thread tying us together in the past day is this restaurant .."}
{"text":"Avoid the Guacamole. Chips are super salty and it's just average guac. The tacos are really good. Especially the beer battered fish ones. Over priced menu. There are just better taco spots on 17th."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. Very tight seating arrangements when busy. Sat on a stranger's lap but it was their first date so was not awkward. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy but no wait for the bar. It was a really nice place - cute lighting and great latin music mixed in with some rap as well. The server was so nice and always checked in on us to make sure we weren't in need of anything else.   Got several different types of tacos - the guiness braised short rib, red curry short rib, cheeseburger, crispy pork belly and steak. The tacos were $5 each and were pretty small in comparison to the ones I had at Native Tongues - about 2-3 bites I would say. I liked the guiness braised short rib the best because the meat was really flavourful and it was mildly sweet. The red curry one was interesting because it had a sour pineapple relish on top of the meat but I expected it to taste more like curry rather than pickle which it didn't.  The tres leche dessert was huge compared to the tacos and took about a half hour to finish haha Solid piece of cake topped with fresh whipped cream. It was really pretty too.   Went here mainly for tacos so thats what we got! There are other things on the menu too like ceviches which I have never tried but maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Went in for late night Happy Hour because Cleaver couldn't accommodate our group of 3. We were quickly greeted by the host and got a table right away. Cocktails were on special so we took a look at the menu, which is when my shock and complete disgust started.   They use cultural appropriation as a marketing technique which is cheap, tasteless, racist and completely insensitive. (example: \"the gringo\", \"esy\", \"pablo escobar\", \"el chapo\" cocktails or the phrase \"B****H, I know Guac is extra\" on the menu). They use shock factors and gimmicks to attempt to draw attention from a younger crowd and it just comes across as pathetic.  The cocktails themselves were sub par. They tried, hard... but fell short. Flavors had no balance, they were hastily thrown together and again used cheap gimmicks to try and jazz things up, like giving you viles of what looks like blood that you add to your drink.  The server was a slob, literally wearing leggings, sneakers and a sweatshirt. You'd think with it being a new restaurant there would be some type of dress code. She had no personality (or didn't care to put in the effort to show it) and was constantly lingering around our table to try and up-sell us even though we told her right away that we are only in for a drink or two for happy hour. The only time she wasn't present was when it was time for us to pay our bill and leave?   I've never written a bad review for any company before, but i feel that Gringo St. deserves it. I hope this place doesn't last, great location was totally wasted on this place."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Sunday night to find this place completely empty! Our sever seated us immediately and paid very close attention to our needs (perhaps a little too much attention..)   We ordered tacos from the happy hour menu (yay!) and had the guacamole and chips. Overall a great restaurant with decent food. Unfortunately didn't make my list of places to go to twice in a trip but overall a great place to try if you haven't been there before. It would have probably been a great place to go to on a Friday or Saturday night for a girls night out."}
{"text":"Design-forward with an amazingly creative menu!  Sb, we don't have the MS-13 boogeyman in Canada, so relax please."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and who can beat sitting on a patio during a warm night? There were a group of 4 with reservations yet it took us two moves to finally share a patio table. We did end up making it there! The high top that we started at was small with uncomfortable seats so was well worth the move.   We tried it all! Guacamole, fundido, skewers, salads, tacos and both the churro and Nutella dessert. The tacos were great but the other dishes left me wanting more, especially for the price. If memory serves me (there were many margaritas!) the kale guacamole was $15 and yet tasted somewhat bland and small. They tried to make their dishes fun (one dip was served with cheetos on top) and presentation was nice. Really liked the shrimp and kale salad and thought the tacos were great. The rest, not so much.   Overall I think this is a great place to sit and chat - great vibe."}
{"text":"Can I give less stars? Minus stars? The food, honestly maybe a 2/5. Pork belly taco was alright. Service was lacking in timing, seating and greeting. Told to leave because they had a reservation coming in. Still had dessert on table. Server was nowhere to be found forever until abruptly telling us to pay.  I'm Latin American from Baja , and I can tell you the Gang they're referring to in all the menu items, marketing is a hard up \"rape murder kill\" gang. Calling people \"ese\" is actually a derogatory term, and what did I expect from a place called a racial slur. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks back and took FULL advantage of their happy hour specials. First - their cocktails are off the hook gooooood. We tried several of their signature tacos and loved them all. The pork belly was hands down our favourite. It's a tad grounded for my personal liking - lots of patrons and staff have to squish past you while you're eating or drinking, but that would not stop us from coming back to mow down on the tacos!!!"}
