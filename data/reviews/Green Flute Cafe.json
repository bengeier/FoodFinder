{"text":"The food is great and the owners amy and Ed are wonderful too! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Had a friend visit Charlotte, gluten free was the charge. She found Green Flute, gluten free menu for everyone. The omelette was whipped up and served as cheese steak. Great cheese steak quesadilla  and mouthwatering bake goods. It's around back enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here with my fiancee who is gluten free. Their omlettes and French toast are amazing! We also enjoyed some out of this world fresh baked donuts. Owners were very friendly and accommodating. We will return!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised by all of the five star reviews on this place. As someone who has required a strict gluten free diet for the last 9 years, I was so excited to finally have a 100% gluten free restaurant here in Charlotte. I really, really wanted to love it! Sadly, I did not.   On the plus side, I did feel very safe eating here. There is truly no risk of cross contamination, which is a huge win that cannot be overlooked. It's so refreshing to be able to order anything that I want on the whole menu. I love that!  However, the food and service both left much to be desired. My husband and I were quite disappointed with our orders...our \"hot\" sandwiches were served cold and I could easily have made them better at home. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but the staff was clearly overwhelmed and untrained in how to properly run a food service business. We waited 40+ minutes for two sandwiches in this deli-style restaurant and, after having the wrong food brought over multiple times, our orders still weren't correct when they finally came. At that point, we were hungry and annoyed and just ate them anyway. I do have hope that Green Flute will improve some of this over time, as they are still pretty new."}
{"text":"Celiac owner/operator, so you know it's safe. The prices, the menu, and the people are very down to earth. I don't think there's another place like this out there.  The cafe is a little tough to see, it's around back and the entrance is behind a hedge, but you need to find it. Homemade decadent comfort desserts include doughnuts with maple syrup and bacon, lemon tarts, tons of chocolate cake desserts. We had the doughnuts, they were delicious!  We had omelets for brunch. They were accommodating of our lactose intolerant party member. They added feta to one of the omelets on request. The food was cooked to order and served by the proprietor who obviously cares about the food and the customer. The breakfast was filling, piping hot, and delicious. Even the coffee was good: not burnt, not watered down, good to the last drop.  This is a great, family-owned and operated spot making home-cooked food at a great price. I'm happy it exists!"}
{"text":"The only dedicated gluten free restaurant in Charlotte that I know of. Sadly the owner posted notice of the restaurant's closing in the Charlotte celiac connection fb page on march 2017."}
{"text":"I can't not love a gluten free business, honestly! As someone with Celiac Disease, it's always so comforting to be able to eat somewhere with no worries of getting horribly ill. The food I got to eat was very yummy, although the options were limited because they had sold out on a LOT of ingredients by the time I got there (30 minutes before closing, the dang I-77 traffic made us get there way later than we intended). Things were a little chaotic in there, but I could appreciate the fact that it seems to be a new, small business with not a lot of help. The two people working (I'm assuming are both the owners) were very nice and friendly and apologetic for the chaos. I hope their business continues to grow, it sure seems like it will! Anyway, we did think it was pretty strange that 90% of the menu contained dairy, since most people with Celiac Disease have a hard time digesting dairy, with their damaged small intestines. Typically I've found a lot of gluten free restaurants will mark what is dairy free and have many dairy free options for that reason. Not that big of a deal though. I ended up eating a dish that contained dairy because the few nondairy options were gone (they'd run out of eggs and beans), but the ham panini was very delicious as well as the coleslaw that came with it. Me and my family got some of their smores desserts, and those were SUPER yummy too. Definitely a great business idea with lovely owners, and while there were some things I would suggest doing differently, so far they're doing a really good job with everything."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food is delicious! Owners/staff are very friendly & go the extra mile to make it enjoyable. Difficult to find but well worth the effort!"}
{"text":"My wife has Celiac Disease and has been GF for over six years. We used to live outside NYC and have been to many GF restaurants and places that serve GF options there and though out CT. I must say Green Flute is one of the best places we've been. The sandwiches don't have that \"GF taste\" and are delicious. The desserts are amazing; try their version of a s'mores (aka \"crack\"). This place will be a regular staple for us. The family who run it are very friendly and helpful. The prices are more than fair, and most importantly the food is awesome. I recommend you try this place even if you are not gluten-free."}
{"text":"Great place, totally GF and you can't tell at all.  Also the owners are wonderful people.  A bit confusing to find - it is in the back of the building."}
{"text":"This is an amazing concept. A safe haven for gluten intolerant tummies! It's so awesome to not have to worry about what you order on the menu. AND they have homemade desserts! This is priceless that I can take my daughter out to eat and not worry. It's so friendly and the food was over and above my expectations. In fact it was so good we ordered another veggie quesadilla to share! I hope everyone stops in to give it a try because we really need this in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Short version: Dedicated Gluten Free Caf√© with excellent service and fresh, homemade food...GO THERE!  Long version: Found this place on the Find Me Gluten Free App. Only place in Charlotte, to my knowledge and that of the owner's, that is a dedicated GF restaurant. Anyway, I saw online that they had a whole dessert menu and I needed a GF cake for an office going away party.     I took a chance and sent them a private message on Instagram (where they post their daily specials) asking if they had cakes available for purchase in the morning as they close at 2:30pm and it was already after 4pm. I got a reply in less than 5 minutes from the wife (owners are a lovely husband and wife team) telling me that should could whip something up in the morning for me to pick up in time for the party. Amazing customer service for a super short notice type of order.    I stopped by at 10:40am the following day and walked into a large, open, lovely space with the husband and wife giving me warm greetings as soon as I walked through the door. We chatted briefly and she presented me with a beautiful Chocolate bundt cake with chocolate chips, topped with powdered sugar. I don't know why I didn't photograph it while it was whole (check out my pictures to see what the inside looked like) but it looked and smelled like chocolatey heaven!     Everyone in the office absolutely loved it! It was moist, fresh, not heavy and had zero indication of being gluten free. I was so pleased with their service and quality of the cake that I absolutely cannot wait to go back for lunch; Especially since they are opening on Saturdays now! Did I mention it was just $25? I would have payed that much for a regular cake anywhere else, never mind the fact that this was super rushed and made to order. If their delivery range was just 3 more miles, we'd be ordering lunch at the office more times a week.     Overall great customer service, great quality, nice open seating, plenty of parking...will totally return for more than just cake. If the rest of the food is as good, my waistline is in trouble! Btw, from the parking lot, go around to the back on the bottom level. You will see their sign."}
{"text":"This is going to be a review that the owners are not going to like, but that other Yelper's may end up appreciating. We flew into Charlotte today and had found The Green Flute on Yelp. We were very excited about eating there as my wife is gluten intolerant. So we went out of our way to drive there. Then out of our way to find the place only to find a note on the door that they were closed for the day. I understand that things happen, but are you running a business or a hobby. Seems odd that someone would NEED to call a restaurant to see if they happen to be open for business, but so it seems. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First, let's start by saying you'd never know the food was gluten free. (Sometimes gf food tastes a bit rough tbh).  The restaurant offers a fantastic breakfast and lunch menu and all of the deserts are made in house. I haven't tried one yet but totally will be in the future.  The owners are absolutely wonderful and their restaurant has great family feel. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Had no idea gluten free could taste this good!"}
{"text":"I had to revise my review.   I stopped in again to ask about ingredients after having some allergic/intolerance reactions from eating here the first time.  I was told that the wife makes everything from scratch, but come to find that it's not really scratch as I thought. She uses pre-made, store-bought flours. They are gluten-free, yes, but they have all sorts of other things like potato starch, soy, corn, etc. A much higher percentage of the population is allergic to soy and corn than to gluten, so to find out that it's not really \"scratch\" is disappointing. The bread and wraps also are store-bought and contain stuff like corn syrup.  Yes, gluten-free, but no, not really healthy. I expected more. I suppose it's a good start for Charlotte, but I'd rather the focus be more on healthy, homemade things. Example: Pure Pizza makes their pizza dough and there's only about 5 ingredients which exclude the most common allergens."}
{"text":"If you have Celiac... Or even if you don't... You should check this place out! Wonderful sandwiches, excellent cake doughnuts, and gluten free goodness for days. I was very pleased with my trip and will, no doubt, return."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact it's a Gluten free restaurant!  That's a huge plus.   Food is wonderful, great sweets, great bread, I got homemade cinnamon rolls on Father's day!  Very well priced. I would easily pay more.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I got a little choked up during my experience here and actually left right after I finished eating. I will certainly be back and I hope to be able to go up and thank the owners next time. This place is amazing. First, the food is incredible. Yummy stuff that will hit just the right spot and a pretty expansive menu. Rotating daily specials and a knock your socks off offering of baked desserts. Seriously, the food is delicious. What choked me up a little was that I am recently diagnosed with being unable to eat gluten. It has rocked my world and I have struggled with eating out. If I do find a place with a gluten free menu I still have to worry about cross contamination and feeling like I just belong in a bubble. But at Green Flute, I was normal. I didn't have to order off of a special menu with limited choices. I could pick whatever I wanted. I had choices. And my food came out delicious! It was incredible and I am very thankful to them for opening such a business. Please everyone come and support this great restaurant."}
