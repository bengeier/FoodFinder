{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into Inigo, as I had read the other reviews here on Yelp. 

I met a friend there on my latest trip to TO and when we walked in we were greeted warmly even thought they were ready to close for the day. I ordered the half white meat chicken and it was tender and perfectly cooked. Not dry at all. The quinoa and celery root salad was a great accompaniment. Both were clean food- not greasy- which is so hard to find in a counter service/take away place. 

My friend ordered the half chicken with the orange and fennel salad. She loves fennel and said it was really good. We also ordered a side of potatoes to share.

A few days later I ordered a whole bird with sides for take away and the food held up well on the drive home. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Brightly-lit and comfortable, this cute space offers reasonably-priced roasted chickens (grain-fed and free-range), as well as \"other species\" (as listed on their menu). Everything is separately-priced, allowing you to craft your own meal.

I opted for a 1/4 chicken (dark meat) sided with the candied beet and apple salad. Made for a nice and light lunch. The spicing on the chicken wasn't overly strong and the skin was a nice crispness. This won't blow your mind, but it's a solid chicken meal at $3.75 for a leg. I really enjoyed my beet and apple salad and would get that again as a snack.

I pictured their winter minestra (bacon, turnip, cabbage) soup as a chowder, and this was full-on soup. Tasty and warming, this was a nice accompaniment to my chicken.

I ordered the braised beef cheeks to-go for lunch the next day, and was also surprised that it was less stew-like and more soupy than I had imagined. The beans and small potatoes I paired with it were right out of a steam-tray and nothing exciting.

Overall, everything was nice, but there were no standouts. The basics are fairly well-priced, but can total higher than you'd think. A meal of chicken, salad, and soup, came up to just over $14. I would order a larger portion of chicken next time instead of the soup, and that would keep it under the $10 mark. A whole chicken will cost you $12.

This is a solid place in the neighbourhood. Worth a visit if you're in the area and wanting a light meal."}
{"text":"Why did they open a place to sell chickens with NO taste? I mean there isn't even salt. No pepper. No smoke or BBQ flavour.  It is expensive and inferior."}
{"text":"Decent food at an OK price-point, poor execution/service made for an only so-so experience.

Ordered: half-chicken + flat water + potato/green bean salad+hot sauce+chipotle sauce. $14 total.

Chicken was moist, flavorful, not greasy, well portioned. Same with the salad. No complaints.

Service errors:
-Charged friend for dark meat instead of white, made her come back up and pay extra 75 cents (should have eaten that cost. Seemed cheap)
-Gave us food in to-go packages even though we were eating in
-Gave me tap water instead of the bottle I ordered
-Didn't remember to tell us they were out of the hot sauce at time of ordering, gave back 50 cents

Anyway, for a quick little bite to eat- it seemed like almost every service bone-up that could happen, did. And we were the first ones in, so it wasn't a confusing lunch hour rush. 

Food, though, was quite nice. So if the ordering process goes OK, this would be a good spot to pick up and go eat in the park across the street."}
{"text":"When news came down that a portuguese chicken joint had opened on #QNW I was excited. I have no problem biking to College and Ossington for a good old feast, but something closer to home, which is really where you need a full chicken the most, that's good news.

I arrived at 5:56 on a Sunday afternoon just as they were closing up but the waitress was pleasant and happy to help and there was still freshly cooked chicken. Sadly they've given up on serving fries (even though there's a deep frier right there! What a tease!) but their cold potato and green bean side is amazing and may actually be my Side of the Summer (TM AK 2011). The chicken was juicy and delicious. Good and fatty, but not overly so. The price was right too, around about what most people sell chicken for, so thankfully Inigo resisted Queen West inflation.

All in all it's a great place. I think I'd only do pick up as the seating seems small and the beauty of the food is that you can take it anywhere, but I'm sure my mind could be changed if I wanted to escape the heat or something.

It's a good place and I hope it sticks around and continues to perfect and already good set up."}
