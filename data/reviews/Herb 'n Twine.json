{"text":"Preface: I don't even like sandwiches (save for my mom's PB&J and Slyman's).

How good can a sandwich place possibly be without an oven or a stove? Well, if you're at Herb 'n' Twine the answer is 'amazing.' Herb 'n' Twine finally fills that artisanal sandwich void that Local West attempted to step into a year ago. The difference? - thoughtful and innovative sandwich combinations, well developed flavor profiles, and a dedication to quality ingredients and expert preparation. I went in when they first opened and had a delicious Korean Fried Chicken sandwich, but I thought \"beginner's luck.\" Since then there has been a 2nd time, and a 3rd, and a 4th, and a...I lost count. My girlfriend and I have eaten our way through the whole menu and nothing has disappointed. Our favorites are the Korean Fried Chicken, the Meatball, and the Porchetta, or whatever is on special that day. Soups are great too! (oxtail pho to die for).

Don't miss out on this great local sandwich place - check their Instagram for daily specials!"}
{"text":"The bread was to top notch and they made sure the sandwich was overstuffed. But I definitely didn't love what I ordered, a chicken caprese special, which is my bad. I should have just asked for it vegetarian as I didn't enjoy the pulled chicken and felt the overwhelming amount of it made the fresh mozzarella and tomato pretty much irrelevant. Next time, I'll do better with my order."}
{"text":"Knocked it out of the park three days in a row three different sandwiches!  This is the best place to get a good sandwich in Cleveland.  Herb n Twine is so much better then everyone else even the place on Detroit near 74th. You can not compare the two.  

These sandwiches are so fresh with unique ingredients, and a great atmosphere.

Herb 'n Twine takes it to the limit.  Best sandwich in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Turkey, Prime Rib, the  Cuban- the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in Cleveland! The bread is perfection; not too thick but thick enough that the whole thing doesn't get soggy and collapse into mush. It's crunchy where it needs to be and firm enough to keep all of the delicious meats and cheeses held together, and it's fresh baked.

The meats are roasted, heavenly, juicy, flavorful, amazing, and I promise you'll crave them! Once you try a sandwich here, you're gonna be hooked."}
{"text":"This place has set a high bar for sandwiches. The veggie sandwich is legit one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. And I love meat so that says a lot. The only thing is, I've often gone and they have run out of bread so I'm not able to get anything. Which I guess also says a lot!"}
{"text":"Brendan and Nicole are awesome! Their sandwiches not only knock it out of the park but the bleu cheese croutons are out of this world! They are all apart of the big Lorain rd. Renaissance and are really doing a great job!"}
{"text":"If I never eat another Italian sub from anywhere but Herb and Twine again, it'll be too soon! The most delectable sandwich I've had in a very long time! It's simple, but delicious. I've been craving it every day since I first had it. 

Friendly and fun staff make this place the quaint little artisan sandwich shop it is. 

They have special sandwiches they make every few days, and you can find them on Instagram. The pictures alone will make you drool! 

Please please please do yourself a favor and check them out! 

*Portions sizes are good too : )"}
{"text":"Came here all the way from Pittsburgh. Amazing sandwiches... coming from a Pittsburgher. I highly recommend, especially if you like a lot of meat on your sandwich."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sandwich shop in Cleveland. Every sandwich is crafted with love and packed with flavor. Haven't been let down yet and will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Such a fantastic place to eat. I got a salad my fianc√© got a sandwich and man, were both amazing. Love this spot and their delicious food."}
{"text":"The best sandwich joint in Cleveland hands down!! So many great menu options and the daily specials are always delicious!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came in yesterday for lunch and had a great time.  The menu had lots of exciting items, but I was with my sister who is a vegetarian so we got got the vegetable pot pie soup and the veggie sandwich to split.  Both were tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed the veggie sandwich which showcased the lowly beet- the underdog of the vegetable world in my opinion.  I am also an avid diet pop drinker, yes, I know, terrible, so I appreciated that diet coke was available for die hards like myself that can bring themselves to class up their beverage game to something like iced coffee or sparkling water.

The best part of the meal though was the staff.  From start to finish they were warm and generous and had a good sense of humor.  It also didn't hurt that they got our meal out to us in about five minutes!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh I am so ashamed it took me so long to visit this establishment but to make up for lost time I keep visiting frequently! I love that they have a punch card because who doesn't love a free sandwich every now and again. The sandwiches here are delectable! It have already decided that I have to try every single sandwich before I can pick my favorite. Some people like to complain about the prices of the sandwiches but these sandwiches are huge and jam packed with deliciousness! I am so happy this is a mid way stop from work to where I volunteer, very convenient!"}
{"text":"Love the decor inside and the menu has somr very interesting sounding sandwiches that Id go back to try. Fried chicken was too dry but had great flavor and I loved the bread. Really enjoyed the house salad as well the olive tapenade was a great addition."}
{"text":"If you want the best sandwich in Cleveland, this is your place. My favorites are the shaved prime rib, meatball, turkey club, and Italian. Always get a cup of tomato soup when you come in the winter, it's delicious and warms up great if you save it for later."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my roommate. I got the grilled cheese and he got the veggie sandwich, and we both are half of each. It's super refreshing for a veggie sandwich to have what seems like really well thought out flavor combinations, which doesn't usually happen. The grilled cheese was to die for. I am going to go here instead of Melt from now on."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and it's quite a home coming from the chagrin valley. We love it here and it never disappoints. The sandwiches are all so good and everything is made from scratch.
My one child always gets the Bahn Mi and quite honestly, it's out of this world. The other loves the turkey club and for me, it's a deconstruction of a sub into a salad.
My only issue with this place is that the beverage selection is a bit pricey and way too artisan for me. Can't I just get a bottle of regular water? Granted, the Sodas and cold brew coffee are fab, but who wants to spend 3 extra dollars for a water when you are already spending a bit on a sub.  Regardless, some of the best sandwiches in CLE and suggest ones tries it.

Went today for Lunch and they have some of the best soups ever. Yum"}
{"text":"So good! I had their veggie sandwich and it was a perfectly balanced between salty and sweet! Love the pistachio sauce with the beets. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch last friday with a friend on our day off. I had tried their food before but this was my first time visiting their store. The staff is super friendly and knows how to make a mean sandwich! After debating all of the delicious offerings I opted for the chicken sandwich and from the first bite I was in love! The spicy chicken and fresh slaw paired with the delectable sauce I couldn't put it down. 

Their cozy seating area paired with a tasty sandwich and bag of chips makes this a great place    for lunch! However cozy does mean that you may have to wait for a seat during the lunch rush. 
I cannot wait to go back here and try every sandwich on their menu!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches in the City. Hands Down. I'd get the turkey or the prime rib, highest quality meats for sheez!"}
{"text":"Great gourmet sandwiches with quality meats and other ingredients and unique flavors.  Homemade fresh rolls and more meat than bread which is rare.  You get your money's worth.  Staff is efficient and super nice."}
{"text":"Two words.... Duck confit!!!! It was awesome I half n halved it with the fried chicken sandwich, it wasn't my favorite but might float someone else's boat....... The duck definitely stood out!! Ohh!!!!! Vegan brownies are delicious if they have them and you can afford the calories!!"}
{"text":"They did it again!  I had the smoked turkey club and tomato bisque soup, it was Fantastic!"}
{"text":"When I walked in to order, the guy said they were out of Chorizo meatball and one other one.  Okay, so now I know what is popular!  I was conflicted...the Cuban or the Turkey?  When the guy told me the Cuban was hot and the turkey was cold, well Cuban it was.  I was expecting more of a traditional Cuban---pressed sandwich---What I got was more of what I would call a Cleveland Cuban. Sub roll, heavy heavy heavy on yellow mustard.  Tasty, but I feel their pricing is overreaching a bit at $10 for said mustard bomb.  I did see another woman's sandwich, and I swear it was the size of her head. So maybe that one is the better value. It looked like the veggie sandwich.  But you know, I try not to stare at people while they are eating...good, but not great sandwich."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and salads. Nice ambiance. I wouldn't drive across town to go, but if you're on the West Side, it's good eats. Very good pickles."}
{"text":"Very cool and simple shot with amazing sandwiches.  The bread is great and you will find yourself craving them every once in a while!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat i found out about this place on yelp actually under the category of hot new businesses.Because of my job i travel alot and yelp always guides me to great places to eat i must say this sandwich shop is defiantly a place you have to try i went with my wife yesterday and i ordered the Korean sub and my wife had the turkey club and we both really enjoyed our sandwiches whenever im in town i defiantly will be stopping by."}
{"text":"My first review but felt compelled to share this place. About every other Friday I get a break from my kids and can pick up one of these delicious sandwiches and enjoy with a pal. Everything I have had has been amazing. From the nice lady taking the orders to the hard working fellas putting it together everything is done perfectly. The prime rib sandwich is the best sandwich in Cleveland. Treat yourself to lunch at this place it will only make your day better."}
{"text":"I went for the first time the other day and had the crispy chicken sandwich.  It was amazing and filling.  A lot of care and attention is paid to making the food.  They have a great beverage selection as well!   If you are ever in Ohio city stop in!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously good! My friend had the turkey club and I had the Hot chicken. Both were big and great! Fresh ingredients and great bread. 

Turkey club is full of off-the-bone turkey and fresh veggies. The hot chicken is equally as amazing and good. Now let me throw a warning out there. The hot chicken is hot. As in spicy. Seriously spicy. I like and enjoy spicy food and this made me stop. It'll clear you out in 3 bites. Whew it's good but it's not for the casual spicy eater. It's not so be warned. 

Overall good experience and I will definitely be back. Here is the only problem. If it's crowded and it was when I went seating is pretty limited. And parking is on the street and it's not very abundant. So be warned. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, you have to go for lunch though because the bread isn't as fresh at dinner time. The roast beef, the grilled cheese, and the Italian are great. And maybe the best drink selection at a restaurant in all of cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to Cleveland international. One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten, and I like to go to a new deli in every city I visit. 
Had the porchetta and the house salad. Salad was excellent too. Smoothly combined unique flavors and tasty homemade dressing."}
{"text":"VERY solid sandwiches. I have a pretty high sandwich standard. This place is really a 4.5 - but since Slyman's won my sandwich heart in Cleveland - I cannot match it here.

We got the prime rib sandwich to split, and the tomato soup with blue cheese croutons (the croutons were not as crunchy as I might have liked, one of those things that is better in writing than execution).

The service was very sweet and fast. Parking on the street was easy-peasy!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for a quick (yet delicious) bite to carry-out, and it exceeded all expectations. The Smoked Turkey Club is layered with flavor, with the gouda, maple bacon, sun dried tomato mayo...all on a roll that can hold up to the plentiful fillings while also being soft enough to not overtake each bite. Mmmm, I can't wait to come back and try some of the other options that look equally as enticing (Did someone say prime rib with Gruyere and basil mayo?)!"}
{"text":"Herb'n Twine lives up to the great reputation it is garnering.  I had seen the super positive reviews on here, as well as had been given a recommendation from a friend, so I really wanted to try it.  He said this was a truly great sandwich shop, like the ones he remembered from living in Seattle.

The d√©cor is simple, almost stark, classic, and clean.  No Cleveland kitsch, cartoons, or Boston ferns to clutter things up.  Everything says - We take sandwiches seriously!  And they do.

I had the Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich, and the Soup O'Day, Cincinnati Chili.  The sandwich was packed with prime rib, as well as flavor.  It was moist delicious, and clearly said that a chef made this.  After my first bite I looked at the guy behind the counter with new respect. 

 I got the chili because I had just gotten back from a trip to Cincinnati, I am originally from Cincinnati, and I sometimes crave Cincinnati Chili.   In Cincinnati their presentation would have been called a one-way, just the chili, no condiments, which I have actually never had before.  A little shredded cheddar, and chopped onion would have gone a long way, but the seasonings, texture, and flavor were right on, and authentic.

Go to Herb'n Twine!  Support it.  We are fortunate to have such a great sandwichery in Ohio City.  Three thumbs up."}
{"text":"Usually I wax on and on about this and that you may find interesting, useful or informative when I write a review.  Not this time.

Hit Herb 'n Twine on a Friday afternoon and all I have to say is SERIOUSLY the best sandwich I've ever had.  Hands down.  These guys know what they are doing to a higher power.  And that's based on only one sandwich.  Can't wait to go back.

Yes, the place is small.  Yes, it takes a while for your sandwich to be made.  Yes, there are limited drink options.  WHO CARES when I'm eating the best sandwich in the world??!!??

What are you waiting for?  Get to this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Quality ingredients. Everything I have tried has been well thought out and prepared. Really good size sandwiches. Not cheap, but I usually get soup and then save half the sandwich for the next day."}
{"text":"Un-Freekin-Believable!

That about sums Herb n Twine up. I popped by with a friend who lives in the area and had my doubts.. Once I walked through that door, I knew we were in a real deal sandwich shop. 

Brendon greater us and promptly took our order. I got the Korean Fried Chicken and my friend got the Prime Rib, with pickles of course (which are bomb!)
We split the sandwiches and I dug into the KFC first. The first bite blew me away... SO good! The Prime Rib was loaded with meat and tasted incredible as well. 

I saved the pickle for desert and knew immediately that I was eating a pickle that Brendon had to of made - Amazing!

Give this place a try, you will NOT be disappointed! I will certainly be back, next time with another friend to share the great food with.

Incredibly tidy shop, neat & clean and perhaps best of all, a gentleman living his dream making bomb ass sandwiches for the good people in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for the first time at lunch. I had never heard of the place although it has been open a few months. I got the smoked turkey club, it was good! Not a huge sandwich but with a bag of chips was enough to be satisfying for lunch. The turkey didn't taste very smokey but was still good. They need to replace their window signage to get noticed. It is black lettering on glass storefront with dark backdrop which disappears and is easily missed. I drive by 44th and Lorain daily headed to 90 and have never even noticed the place. They need white lettering or a fascia sign.  My only gripe is I feel the sandwiches are $1-$2 too expensive. If they were $8 I'd be more likely to be a regular. When you start talking $12 for an average sized sandwich and bag of chips it is borderline pricey."}
{"text":"Love the fun and inventive menu!  My sandwich was delicious.  I will definitely be going back and testing out another one of there menu items."}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches around, no joke. Serious attention to detail, the incredible fresh bread, sandwiches piled high with the highest quality and creativity. The soups and salads are also not to be missed."}
{"text":"Despite not acquiescing to my demands of calling them \"longform sandwiches\" these are still five star sandwiches and whoever is responsible for knocking your average down to 4.5 deserves to get kicked off Yelp and only the lowest scum on earth gets kicked off Yelp.

Tomato Bisque is hard to eat while driving but well worth the 1st degree burns and ensuing moving violations."}
{"text":"Can't get over how delicious these sandwiches are!!!! I try a new one ever time I go and have loved all of them, but the prime rib and kale salad are my favorite for sure! Also, they make all of the sauces from scratch and use all natural meats and ingredients.  Favorite Cle spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it here, beautiful atmosphere and great location being somewhat tucked away from busier parts of town. I got the prime rib sandwich after reading other reviews, and yes it did live up to its name. So good and full of flavor, and just overflowing with meat, which made a bit of a mess. I could only eat half, so it was well worth the price. My grandma had the turkey club and was also a big fan. Definitely a place to try whether you are local or swinging through the area. All of the workers are friendly and you will leave with the most satisfying full your stomach has ever had. Always support your small and local businesses!"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich spot, not the usual assortment of subs . A little on the creative side but it's close to west 25th which was worth the walk for me. The price is reasonable, soup selection is good."}
{"text":"I had the hot chicken it's got good heat. It's good, I'd only suggest adding more of the mayo to get some of that flavor because coleslaw seemed bland. The bread and portion size was good. Great atmosphere and clean inside."}
{"text":"Excellent spot to grab a bite for lunch. Our sandwiches were ready in less than 10 minutes. I had the chorizo sausage sandwich, and it was amazing. The sauce was delicious and bread nice and crispy. My friend had the prime rib which was good but could have used a little more of the sauce."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite sandwich shop near the Tremont area! I love everything thing about it, especially how flavorful the sandwiches are.. Only complain is how pricey is can be!"}
{"text":"A little pricy for sandwiches and salads, but it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely come back. The tomato bisque soup was very good..."}
{"text":"What a nice little craft sandwich shop in the heart of ohio city. Fresh made to order quality sandwiches. The vegetable sandwich had great flavor combinations with the avocado, roasted red peppers and smoked coconut. The addition of tostones gave it great texture as well. The hot chicken sandwich definitely had a kick with a nice balance from the pickled slaw. The lamb meatball sandwich was a amazing take on the traditional. It all came to gether perfectly. Will definitely return to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a late lunch. Decided to split two sandwiches. We got the grilled cheese and the primed rib. Started with the grilled cheese, solid choice, a little heavy on the fig jam, but tasty. 
Then we opened sandwich two, so glad we saved the best for last. The prime rib was amazing! I almost didn't order because it said horsey sauce, and I'm not a fan. But it was balanced perfectly. Huge serving, awesome meat stacked up with sauce and bright greens. 
Will come back and order this sandwich for sure, best sandwich I've had this year in Cleveland.
Home made pickles were also really good."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious. The staff was nice. What more could you want? I got the Italian sandwich and my friend got the lamb meatball one, we gave each other half. Both were equally awesome."}
{"text":"Top. Notch. Sammies. The grilled cheese with seasonal jam is mouthwatering. The bread, crispy and buttery. The cheese, gooey and warm. The jam(s), sweet and complementary. Not to mention, their San Pellegrino selection is aces. If you're into healthy things, the seasonal veggie sandwich is delicious and extremely filling. My fiance and I have been regulars since their opening weekend and have never had a less-than-stellar experience. The owners are just peaches and greet every customer with genuine gratitude and a warm smile!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. My personal favorite is the turkey club. They put a lot of attention into each sandwich they make. Super friendly staff that didn't seem to mind me asking about how they do things.  just out of curiosity. They also have specials that I think change twice a week. Haven't tried on yet, but looking forward to trying one."}
{"text":"We stopped here from Chicago on a road trip out east. This place is an incredible find! The food here is fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sandwich spot. I had the Italian sandwich and it did not disappoint. The menu is not complicated. The tomato bisque soup was freaking delicious. Defenitly coming back to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Herb n' Twine randomly online, and based on the images and sandwich descriptions, we decided to take a chance on something new. We are SO glad we did! The food was wildly delicious, very well seasoned, and expertly prepared. It is also very well priced for the quality, and the portion size you receive. 1/2 of our sandwiches were plenty to fill us up. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the Italian, best sandwich I've ever had! If you haven't been, do yourself a favor and stop in. The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really, really good bread

Amazing homemade pickles

A tad pricey

Great, unique beverage selection

Wish it was open later

All the sandwiches are well above-average"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to grab a bite to eat that's far removed from the raucous atmosphere, insane crowds and general douchbaggery of West 25th Street, you'd be wise to get your hungry butt down to Herb 'n Twine. There's not too much to say about this rather uncomplicated sandwich joint, because that's just what it is. They make everything by hand, while you wait (it isn't fast food, so get your mind right) and it's all from fresh, oftentimes locally sourced ingredients.

So here's the deal. Choose from one of 8 different sandwiches (priced around the $10 mark) and/or one of 4 different salads (about $5). They've got some other goodies too like chips and drinks in a cooler (a cup of water if you ask nicely). Order at the counter. Wait. Eat there are take it to go. That's it. See? I told you it was simple. Oh.and their pickles are fantastic. You get half a pickle with your sandwich. I meant to ask them if they are Randy's Pickles (he's a local pickler), but I got lost in my sandwich and forgot.

Speaking of the sandwich, I had the smoked turkey club and it was delicious. I especially enjoyed the sorta sweet and crunchy bacon along with the sundried tomato mayo. And they're plenty big, too. I ate half there and half later for a snack. You could probably just order one and split it with your other if you wanted to save some cash.

The space is urban chic, exposed brick, high ceilings, and whatnot, and there are plenty of seats if you just can't wait until you get home to gnosh. Why not 5 stars? For starters, I would like to see more bread options. Not that I don't like the Frenchy style baguettes once and awhile, but a nice, softer all-grain would be the bee's knees, right? Oh, and maybe some fresh-brewed iced tea (the iced teas in the cooler are all loaded with sugar and/or artificial sweeteners).

I'm done. Great sandwiches, great service, quiet, out of the way location. Go on now, get."}
{"text":"Always, always fresh. I've never had a bad experience here. If I could, I would give 10 stars. I usually get the Italian every time and I can't seem to try anything else even though they all look good. There is a little wait tome but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check this place out after nearly two years of living near it. We ordered the chorizo meatball sub and the grilled cheese. That grilled cheese was incredible! Bacon, gouda and a black fig spread. Amazing, and left me wanting more. They're also known for their fresh, in-house made bread. Great, small business."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch with a staff member and we ate in. First off the service is just top notch. Very friendly staff from whoever gave me directions to the gal who helped us indecisive folks make a decision and not wind up like the hypothetical buridan's ass. To be fair the veggie options are finite but whatever I had was finger lickin good. The pistachio sauce with beets was just delishicious Mmm mmm.. Yummy in my tummy!! I really started by saying I'll be good and eat only half. That was before I took the first bite. Needless to say that plan did not end well. Having now said that the portion sizes are huge so you will realistically wind up taking some home. 

The meat options seem extensive and my colleague enjoyed his meal thoroughly given how he inhaled  it and then went on to say he'd be back with his wife! The bread here is, I believe, baked fresh so they may run out before the place closes at the end of the day. They also mentioned in an effort to avoid waste they don't prep in advance with inordinate quantities so if they run out for the day that's it. You're coming back and that's not even a bad thing! 

The exposed brick walls and wood flooring has a nice feel even though this is really a fast casual dining kinda place. A+ all the way thru."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are a bit on the pricey side but they are SO worth it. Their Korean Fried Chicken sandwich is by far the best sandwich I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese is AMAZING! They didn't have the jam so I got an apple substituted and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is really cute. They did a great job. Both my guest and I really enjoyed our sandwich. They had a nice selection of local drinks and teas to have with it."}
{"text":"Wonderful and incredibly delicious sandwiches, friendly owners and staff.  The Italian, smoked turkey club and shaved prime rib are my favorites but every one I've had is amazing.  You are missing out if you haven't been here yet!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! I tried the Italian sandwich which was delicious. The sandwiches are really big with a generous portion of meats. I like how they have a very open kitchen concept where you can see them make your sandwiches right on the butcher block. Will definitely be coming back to try the other sandwiches. 
Love the vibe of the businesses on this street. Check out Plum Cafe and Kitchen and Platform while you're around Herb 'n Twine!"}
{"text":"Hellz to the yeah! Such great flavors! I know people have been raving about the Porchetta ($9.50), but I thought the Smoked Turkey Club ($10) was better. Each sandwich comes with half a pickle, and these babies are done just right with a crisp crunch and a slight dill flavor. I personally believe you should alternate bites of sandwich with bites of pickle mmm. I'd say the sandwiches are about 6-7 inches in length with a decent amount of fillings, but I'd probably recommend rounding out the meal with a side of soup or one of their salads. The Tomato Bisque ($4) with blue cheese croutons was smooth and tasty. The Kale Caesar ($5.50) is simple and satisfying especially if you get it with the buttermilk parmesan dressing. They also sell Graham Pretzel Fudge Bars ($3) if you're craving a dessert. 

There was ample free street parking when I went, and once inside you're greeted by a friendly lady working the counter. Here she'll tell you how they try to get as many ingredients locally as they can, and they make as much as they can in-house. I'm talking the bread, dressings, soups, etc. Always love to hear/see/taste that! 

I'd definitely try this place out again. My only slight issue is that $15 for a sandwich and side seems a little pricey. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty good meal, but no large portions nor super exceptional ingredients to warrant the price in my opinion. For $10 you can get 3 tacos and a side at Bomba, or a fried chicken dinner at Chow Chow, and for $12 you can get a burger and fries at Jammy Buggars. I think to make Herb n' Twine more of a regular stop than a once in a while treat, they'd need to throw in some meal deal specials or buy one get one half off coupons. (Don't roll your eyes at me, I'm a financial analyst by trade, I can't help it!)

Overall, happy with my experience and I hope to see some homemade pasta or potato salad sides on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Wow. I wanted a fried chicken sandwich and the fried chicken kimchi was it-crunchy pickled veggies, fresh cilantro, spicy Korean fried chicken on a baguette. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good!
Bread was crispy like a hot panini. Honey siracha chicken was ok but I am in love and now obsessed with their meatball sub. (Said from the girl that never likes/orders a meatball sub.) 
The spicy mole sauce was amazing on chorizo meatball sandwich and I have been craving it ever since. Very disappointed they closed early today (Sat) bc I tried to get it again!!"}
{"text":"Long overdue review. This is one of the best sandwich shops in CLE. Small menu but who cares as they hit all 4 corners including vegetarian. Called in my order after work. I live 5 minutes away and made a point of getting my order in an hour before they closed as wasnt sure what would be available. Wanted to try Porchetta they were out. Went with the steak sandwich and Korean chicken. OMG, both outstanding! Steak was super juicy and prime quality. The Korean chicken I was skeptical about because it's a fried chicken breast. And, many restaurants will fry the chicken in the morning; by the end of day if still available it's old, old, yuck. Not the case here. Both sandwiches were awesome. This is the real deal, \"hand crafted\" sandwiches and worth $10 each.  Staff/owner so nice! Definitely put this place on your radar and eat here often!"}
{"text":"Terrific, friendly service.
I wish I was there right now, instead of this horrible bar w angry Canadians :)
Cleveland is a great city."}
{"text":"We rocked up to Herb n' Twine on Labor Day to grab some sandwiches to bring to Platform.  A few other people came and went while we were there, mostly to go orders, but it definitely was not busy.  There menu is pretty brief and too the point, one veggie sandwich and a handful of meat options.  It feels like they basically picked a few sandwich options that they could really perfect and stuck with those.   

Hubs got the ubiquitous Italian sandwich (Grinder).  It was everything I remember from my days growing up in New England.  Provolone, mortadella, coppa, prosciutto, soppressata, vinegar marinated onion, herbs and shredded lettuce.  Only this is a super elevated version.  

I got the special soup, a gazpacho which tasted great but it was weird.  Not a thick puree but a cold chunky soup.  It lived up to my expectations for gazpacho in flavor only.  I sorta wish they would have clarified this in some way, but again it tasted great.

The only drawback was -- it took them a really long time to make one sandwich and bag up a soup.  Like 20 minutes.  To make a single sandwich.  They slice the sandwich ingredients to order.  Not sure if that makes an appreciable difference in the taste, esp. when they factor in the time it takes to do it.  

Bottom line: Eat their sandwiches, be prepared to wait to eat them."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in Cleveland...period!  There is a good variety of options and they are all well curated with fresh/flavorful ingredients and tasty bread baked daily.  The guest sandwich specials are always unique and usually my favorite option! This Ohio City restaurant itself is welcoming with options to dine in or plenty of street parking for a quick pickup. And I almost forgot that the pickle that comes with the sandwich makes this meal even better!"}
{"text":"Wow. Herb n Twine moved into my neck of the woods and stepped up the sandwich game. I finally made it to the shop last weekend. I was pleasantly surprised. We had the fried chicken sandwich and the italian. Both were great. The fried chicken sandwich was served with a sweeter slaw. The italian was great and my lone fault was that it was a little dry. More vinegar or avocado would have been great. Nonetheless, it was delicious and since Gabe's closed down, I need a new sandwich go-to. This seems like a great place and has a dozen different types of sandwiches, soups and sides. I am excited to go back and try more."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this sandwich shop, so I've stopped in fairly regularly since it opened. The turkey club is my go-to: delicious turkey, crispy bacon, and fresh toppings. In my heart, there is a poem- a deep, loving, thoughtful ode to  H+T's tomato mayo. It shows up in my dreams sometimes. If you have a hankering for a sauce that will fulfill you on a spiritual level, the tomato mayo is it. 

The staff is friendly and willing to customize for you, and it's right next door to a phenomenal waxing studio (Bloom and Clover). If you feel like getting fresh and smooth, followed by a satisfying and delicious sandwich experience, stop by 41st and Lorain and do things right. Do not forget the mayo :)"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch today and was excited to try the porchetta after my friend raved about it. They were out (this was post-lunch rush); I was disappointed but there were plenty of other options that I also wanted to try. I ended up with the Italian and a chop salad and very much enjoyed both! 

They felt bad for running out of porchetta (probably because I looked like a sad puppy dog when they told me), so they sent me off with a sample of what they had left over (the butt-end, as I think he described it) with all of the fixings. It was a very kind, thoughtful gesture that I will not soon forget. I can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Such a short menu, but packed with flavour! The sandwiches are filled with tender meats and tasty pairings of homemade sauces. I tried the cuban today with homemade bread, fresh carved meats, and homemade cheese it was absolutely fantastic.

Will definitely be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Great selection of tasty sandwiches. Prime Rib sandwich is top notch. Worth every penny. House salad was delicious too - almost seemed underpriced at $5.00! 
Will definitely swing by to pick up sandwiches when in the neighborhood. Some of the best I've had in Cleveland. Service was very friendly too."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. Small little shop on Lorain, will drive right by if not explicity looking for it. Boy am I happy I was looking for it.

I ordered the chorizo meatball sandwich. As I unwrapped the sandwich, the paper 'to go' covering was moist from the juices emanating from the meatballs and smoked mole. Before even taking a bite, I instinctually knew I was going to love it. I quickly loosened a notch on my belt. After one bite, I took off my pants and ate the rest in my boxers. 

The sandwich is a cultural symphony, nay a grand cultural orchestra, with a bunch of different flavors coalescing perfectly in each bite. You get the Italian from the meatballs, then the Mexican from the smoked mole, then the Thai from the cilantro and Indian from the spices. The bread is clearly freshly baked as well and has a great texture for soaking up mole and creama juices while the meatballs melt in your mouth. This is more than a sandwich - it feels like a gourmet meal given all the unique and delicious flavor profiles involved, more than justifying the $9.50 price tag.

I kid you not, after my last bite of the sandwich, I stood up in my boxers and valiantly declared \"That was one great sandwich.\" Will be back again soon to try another sandwich although chorizo meatball will be tough to beat!"}
{"text":"Great small eat in /takeout sandwich shop. We got the special crispy chicken sandwich with pickles a delicious mayonnaise sauce and fresh slaw on top. loved i!   Will be back to try the prime rib soon. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are the bomb. Italian is my fav but all are great! Pretty fast service for the quality.  True artisan."}
{"text":"Such a good sandwich!! The staff was super friendly, too! Wasn't crazy about the soup."}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT A DRILL. The Shaved Prime Rib sandwich from Herb 'n Twine is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in Cleveland.

This lovely new addition is Legit with a capital L.  I can't explain it, but I've never considered myself a \"sandwich\" person for a meal. As in, I'm never like, \"Let's get a sandwich!\" But touch√©, Herb 'n Twine, because you've hooked me with your quality, creativity and more than reasonable prices.

To begin, the location itself is just lovely. It has an open, simplistic feel with an exposed brick wall and one giant piece of contemporary art. You order at the counter, find your seat, and they'll call your name when its ready. The menu has interesting and creative ingredients, and the owner, Brendon, is more than happy to give you suggestions.

The Prime Rib sandwich literally melted in my mouth. Everything was so fresh that it honestly hurt my feelings. The meat was juicy and tender, the bread was the perfect blend of buttery toasted and the onion jam gave it a sweet kick without being too overpowering. The portions themselves are huge, so be prepared to take a half home! The half of a sandwich with a pickle was more than enough for me, and i'll love on those leftovers later. Can't wait to come back again and bring friends, because everyone will love it!"}
{"text":"Get good, friendly staff, very welcoming cool and easy going vibe. Stop in and check this one out."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a replacement for my dearly departed Gabe's Deli, and, alas I keep looking. 

The first time I came here I ordered the Shaved Prime Rib because everyone here was raving about it like it was sent down from heaven on a golden platter. I think that was my first mistake. I like everything that comes on it but it (sadly) just did nothing for me, which didn't surprised me because it's not really something I would have ordered so I can't hold it against Herb 'n Twine. The next time I went I ordered what I wanted to the first time before divine intervention took over- the smoked turkey club. Turkey bacon and gouda is my idea of heaven so this time I was taking my own path to enlightenment. It was okay, but I didn't find it as wonderful as my remarkably hungover roommate did so I let her have the second half for $5 (as any good business woman would do). There's something off about it and I'm not sure if it's the mayo or what. I feel like every sandwich I've ordered has something trendy, and I love trendy, ingredient that throws it off for me. Additionally, I like my bacon well done and crispy but when they say smoked bacon they mean smoked like smoked salmon.

I like that they carry the local Old City Soda and that they make their own pickles. They have a good chip selection and the tomato bisque sounds amazing minus the whole blue cheese thing. 

To be honest I'm a bit underwhelmed by Herb 'n Twine but I love the vibe and they get another star because everyone I've brought here seems to really enjoy their sandwiches. Next on my list to try is either the Cuban, Italian, or Chorizo Meatball"}
{"text":"I am forever in pursuit of the best deli sandwich (for my taste) and this place is the best in the area. Consistently friendly service, good food, and value. I have a hard time deviating from their Italian sub, but have tried multiple things on their menu at this point. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich blew me away with the first bite!! Every bite was so flavorful and you can easily tell they only use the freshest ingredients. Little empty on the inside but I'd rather go somewhere based on their stellar sandwiches than a fancy inside.  Little pricey at $10 a sandwich, but Herb n Twine is absolutely worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As a Virginia transplant, I have finally found subs that exceed Wawa. This is the highest possible praise I can give a sandwich. 

The turkey club is great, with real turkey instead of whatever passes for it at most sandwich shops. I particularly loved the use of bacon pieces that are crispy, almost with a candied quality to them. 

The meatball, on the other hand, is life changing.

One problem: They close early when they run out of bread, which is fine, but as this place gets more popular they should probably increase their daily bake. I get you might be out of luck if you walk in 30 minutes before close, but sometimes you'll show up at 1 and they're already shut down for the day."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool, and I like that they come up with out of the box creations. It wasn't all that busy, and it took about 10 minutes after we ordered to get our food. I'd much prefer the wait that comes with getting quality ingredients instead of tub meat at Subway that's been sitting out all day, so no complaints there. I liked everything, but may have gone in with a little too high of expectations, always a downfall. 

The Pork Banh Mi was probably my favorite sandwich. It was a little cilantro heavy for me, stems included, but they were easy to pick off. It had that \"it\" factor, and was really different than any sandwich I'd ever had. 

The Nashville hot chicken was just okay. No complaints, but nothing really special. It was just missing something, maybe it's just me... 

I love the bread on all of the sandwiches. 

I kind of regret not ordering the shaved rib, everyone seems to rave about that. If I made it back, I'd go that route. 

Everyone at the register was really friendly."}
{"text":"Quality sandwhiches very casual seating ; best probly for millenials w the extra cash to spend. I think should be couple bucks less (w optional tipping)"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome sandwich shop in Cleveland! The Cuban is fantastic and the spicy chicken is delicious as well! You won't find a fresher and cleaner restaurant with fast and friendly service. Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"the humble sandwich
stuff between two bread slices
but here it's magic

I'm usually like
 \"oh...  ...another sandwich shop....   ....whateves\",
 but this is a special, special place. I can't wait to try every last sandwich they make. I watched them build a to-go order for me not only with exceptional care, but beautiful ingredients as well. The Korean Chicken was a blend of a not overdressed slaw, so it did not turn into a soggy mess, a very generous anmount of lightly fried breast, and cilantro. Next on my list will be the porchetta sandwich. I saw one being made and, lord have mercy, it was a thing of beauty.  I took a pic of the roasted pork piece they cut to use.  I must have this soon. Perhaps today....  Stop here soon folks.  With all of the \"next best thing\" places opening up, I'll go back here again and again.

Carry on!"}
{"text":"I just had the best sandwich from your restaurant. We found your restaurant from yelp and I'm glad we did. I had the Italian sandwich and it was delicious. Since the restaurant was so small, we got it to go."}
{"text":"I've never had Bahn-Mi before but I was told it's really good. Herb n' Twine made me love Bahn-Mi's! Would definitely recommend! Love the interior and service was awesome (super nice people)! Very Hipster!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped in kind of at the end of the day and they were very gracious about making my sandwich.  I had the house salad--- loved the green olive tapenade and the house dressing. I also had the grilled cheese with fig spread and smoked bacon. Delicious! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this new sandwich shop on Yelp and was so excited to try it!  It's just  few blocks away from my house so I grabbed lunch there today.  Loved the atmosphere, the staff, and more importantly the sammies!  I had the prime rib sandwich and the tomato bisque.  My fianc√© had the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) sandwich, and my friend has the Turkey Club.  It was a very quiet lunch, as we were all too busy shoveling the delicious food into our mouths!  We will definitely be back!!!  The staff was extremely pleasant and the variety of drinks was a really nice added touch."}
{"text":"First time trying for lunch. Sandwich was excellent but for some reason the 5 people who ordered after me all received their sandwiches first including someone who ordered the same thing as me. Will definitely try again but only as a call ahead order."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a sandwich on the way home from a meeting at around 3:30pm. The place was empty (great for me) and I had to get a few more work things done before the end of the day.

I ordered a prime rib sandwich after talking with the employees about what were most highly recommended. And let me tell you- this sandwich was THE SHIT! It was so flavorful with some sort of sweet-ish cream based sauce. There were so many layers of prime rib on this, the bread was super soft and herb-y. The environment was super chill, everyone was easy to talk to and the sandwich was amazing. Literally can't wait to go back here and also telling all of my friends about it."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is delicious. Finally, a serious, thoughtful sandwich shop in the area. I feel like I am back to eating lunch in the Cap City. 

Yes, the sandwiches are 'expensive' but they are also huge and filled with quality ingredients. 

I am in love with the turkey club. As in officially crave and think about it when I am not eating it. It's a perfect sandwich- tons of juicy thin sliced turkey, smoky bacon, fontina and a sun dried tomato mayo. Perfect sandwich. 

Last time we also tried the Korean fried chicken and this time we had the prime rib sandwich. I thought they Korean fried chicken was yummy but was missing a little something- maybe a tad of sweetness in the pickled veggies? Still an amazing sandwich. 

The prime rib was super delicious and I think I'll keep it in the rotation. Of course, when I am not devouring the club. 

I also shared the tomato bisque- very good. Elevated by the blue cheese croutons. Wow. 

Also, go for extra pickles if you are a pickle lover, made in house and crisp and delicious. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Herb n Twine again with the in-laws, but this time, I brought the wife. I was dismayed when they were out of the shaved prime rib, so I went with the Italian sandwich instead. I was not disappointed.  This was an excellent Italian. I'd even say it was probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite Italian sandwich of all time. Potbelly's still holds the top spot for my favorite Italian sandwich in Cleveland.

I can't wait to try the shaved prime rib.

Love this place, despite the price!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches- and it's in my neighborhood.

A new addition to the Ohio City growing restaurant scene, I was pretty happy to see a sandwich place open up. Sometimes I just really want a hot solid fresh sandwich- and lo and behold, Herb n Twine appeared!

It's a cute space- maybe 4-5 tables, and it was completely full when we went for a late lunch around 2pm on Saturday. I ordered the Korean fried chicken sandwich, he got the meatball sandwich, and we got a cup of tomato bisque to top it off (hey, why not).

First of all- the BREAD. They use delicious, thick, crunchy bread- none of that soft, soggy, falling apart bread- the bread they use is good quality. It almost reminded me of banh mi bread- but slightly different. Nonetheless, the bread was delicious.

Second- the ingredients are fresh. Delicious and fresh!!

We were actually surprised how big our sandwiches were too. They were both very flavorful- I had kind of wanted my Korean fried chicken to be spicy (bc, well, most Korean anything is), which it was not, but it was still good. His meatball sandwich was really good meat as well.

The tomato bisque was delcious too- not too salty (which, being more of a broth soup kind of person, I personally dislikes super salty soups, so theirs was GREAT), which even came with almost garlic like type of bread croutons. I'm not sure what they were, but they sure were delicious in our soup!

Overall, I really liked this place for a solid sandwich- if you're looking for a quick and solid sandwich shop- deflinitely stop by Herb n Twine."}
{"text":"The first time my wife and I experienced Herb 'b Twine it was a positive experience. Savory, tasty sandwiches (I highly recommend their prime rib one). In the area, there doesn't seem to be a lot of places with the kind of niche this sandwich shop as carved out. Though for us, that's as far as good went.

After this first visit, we tried multiple times to patronize this place. On three additional occasions, we drove/walked up to the door only to find the place closed! Based on their listed Yelp and website hours, we visited them (between the three additional visits) within 1 to 3 hours before they closed- each time met with a closed shop. Very disappointing from a customer service standpoint. If the sandwich shop is going to post business hours, they should abide by them. This alone has deterred us from trying to patronize this business again."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were designed for people on the run eating like N.O.R.E of Capone N Noreaga. Herb 'n Twine is in part of the old Speak In Tongues building on Lorain. I have weird memories of Speak in Tongues and it is odd to step back into that building. I don't need to be eating bread much because my gut will be doughy like the bread. You are what you eat. The salads look good and next time I will order that. I had two sandwiches for New Years Eve. I anticipated a rough night and needed to soak up the alcohol. The porchetta served cold while eating it drunk was one of the best sandwiches that I have had in recent memory."}
{"text":"If you're into specialty sandwiches, this is a great spot for you. The bread is fresh and perfectly compliments the unique flavors of the variety of sandwiches. 

You'll find some awesome flavor combinations in each sandwich so it's not a bad idea to take a group and just work through the whole menu. Better yet, grab the sandwich to go and make it a day by eating them at Platform. You may find yourself walking back up the street for another round of these gems. 

If you're looking for a next level of sandwich with unique offerings, go out of your way to make sure and stop here...and then grab a few more for the trip home. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for lunch. Everyone devoured their sandwiches and I loved my chop salad and tomato bisque soup (with blue cheese croutons - yum!) The service was friendly and the atmosphere was inviting. Love this new spot in Ohio City."}
{"text":"All I bought was a Cold Bloom bottled drink. Overall I like the place. I just had eaten so I didn't order a meal.
Asked for a menu to check out the items and prices, they were currently out; but staff said \"I can check out everything online\".
I not sure about the seating, seemed minimal.

Went back the next day and my wife was scared of the prices because she used to Subway.
Don't let the prices fool you, you get your monies worth. 
Prime Rib was cooked to perfection, bread wasn't super thick like Subway."}
{"text":"JUST GO.

I haven't enjoyed a Cuban sandwich since I left Tampa, FL, and then I went to Herb'n Twine."}
{"text":"Get the cuban; you won't be disappointed. Or the prime rib. Or, really anything they have on the menu that day. Every sandwich I've had the pleasure of eating has been fantastic. Seriously tho, get the cuban."}
{"text":"Woah! Amazing sandwiches. The pictures don't even do justice. I got the grilled cheese which was amazing. The prices are bit on the high end for sandwiches but worth it. I also got the kale salad. A full sandwich is more than enough for lunch time so the salad was saved for later. Will come back again"}
{"text":"Had a great first time visit with the Yelp Supper club.  I wanted to order something a little on the healthier side and was pleased they were very accommodating.  I said I like kale, but did not want the Kale Caesar salad.  No problem, they would add kale to any salad I picked.  Said I thought the vegetable sandwich sounded great, but did not want it on the french bread roll..  No, problem, they offered to make it into a salad for me and add kale.  For $6 my salad had spinach, kale, golden baby beets, cucumber, roasted red peppers, pickled onion, radish, sprouts, herbed goat cheese, house vinaigrette and a fresh dill pickle on the side.  It was so colorful, fresh and tasty. I loved it and I suggested that they put it on their menu.  The salad was served in a side size container, but it was packed.  If you are extra hungry split a sandwich or order a soup.

I ordered an Italian sandwich, $10.25, to take home for my husband.  He said that is was really great. He said something was spicy that he could not identify. Note:  Spicy is not a bad thing.  The sandwich was loaded with high quality meats and vegetables on a french bread roll.

I was impressed with their local bottled tea drink offering and recycling bin.  No styrofoam containers here!

Be on the lookout for the new spring menu coming soon.  I see getting to go picnics here on the way to Edgewater Park soon."}
{"text":"I had never been to Herb 'n Twine, but it had been on my list for quite some time. This place will not disappoint you if you're in the mood for a terrific sandwich. I had the Italian and I scarfed every last bite down. I was stuffed but it definitely left a nice taste in my mouth and I'll definitely be returning to this amazing gem"}
{"text":"Look. These sandwiches are fantastic. Delicious. I could go on. Try the grilled cheese. 

My only complaint is that it can take a while to get your order when they're jammed at lunch time. Next time I'm going to call ahead. 20+ minutes is too long to wait. If they got more presses or whatever, they'd be golden. 

But they're still 5 stars. The sandwiches are that good."}
{"text":"Had the special crab sandwich today. Very good and unique. Fresh, tasty, and well put together. I would go back. The only issue was the tea I got. Thought it would be a good try, but ended up tasting like Lysol."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich at this hipsterfied lunch spot. Amazing Nashville hot chicken sandwich with cold slaw relish. 10 out of 10 for sandwiches"}
{"text":"Herb 'n Twine is just awesome.  Brendan and his staff are always coming up with new sandwich and soup creations every week to go along with their regular menu offerings, which are fantastic as well.  My go-to is their turkey club sandwich with a cup of their tomato bisque.  Portions are hearty and the flavors are on point! Everything is made from scratch, including their fresh baked bread, which really makes the sandwich!  It's nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. They use as many local ingredients as possible and operate on a no-waste policy where they only prep enough food based on what they think they'll sell for the day.  In other words, once something is sold out, you're out of luck until the next day! 

Inside is pretty rustic with wood floors throughout and a few small tables to sit down at.  It's fast casual, where you order and pay at the counter and they'll call your name when it's ready. It gets really busy during the lunch rush, so unless you come early, you'll most likely be taking your order to go.
They don't have a parking lot, so it's street parking only. 

Follow Herb 'n Twine on Instagram for their weekly specials! The pictures will have you drooling!

If I didn't live so far on the west side, I'd definitely come here more often because the food and service have yet to disappoint! Keep up the good work, B!"}
{"text":"Best sammies! Fresh, high quality ingredients and the portions are huge! The Italian is my go-to. They hold up surprisingly well for a day in the fridge for leftovers, too, especially since I can only eat half at a time."}
{"text":"Chorizo meatball sandwich. Mole sauce was really good. Meatballs very tasty. Bread tasted like it was made fresh and still had a crunchy crust even with all the sauce on it. The place has a great atmosphere free Wifi. I'll be back to try the other sandwiches they offer."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out. It was amazing- but it wasn't awful. The food was flavorful- but extremely saucy. We got the turkey club without bacon and the prime rib. The turkey was pretty good- but the meat could have used a little more seasoning. It runs on the pricier side- $28 for 2 sandwich's, 2 drinks, and 2 chips."}
{"text":"What a great little sandwich shop! I came here for the first time with the Yelp supper club, and my first impressions were that the location was spacious and bright. Although there are only about 5 or 6 tables, it feels very spread out and open. 
The service when we were there was fantastic, everyone working there was extremely welcoming and accommodating, making special accommodations for our group in the kindest way possible. You'll notice immediately the giant chalkboard menu, but also be sure to take note of their daily sandwich special and daily soup or salad special. (Also check out their Instagram for some major food porn!)

The first time I came I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken sandwich. I'm going to be nitpicky here and tell you that there is absolutely nothing Korean about this sandwich. It is advertised as containing fried chicken with Korean bbq sauce, cilantro and slaw. Besides the fact that cilantro isn't even a Korean ingredient nor can you find it in any Korean restaurant or grocery store, the sauce wasn't anything akin to Korean bbq. It really was more of a sweet and sour sauce like you get at a Chinese restaurant. I could forgive the title if it was at least spicy, but it wasn't at all. Was the sandwich good? Yes, but the title is a total misnomer, but again, I'm being picky. 

BUT there was enough about this place that I loved so I came back the next day to try something else. I went with the Smoked Turkey Club sandwich, which was perfect. Absolutely no complaints on this one. On the one hand, yes it's hard to mess up a turkey club, but this place brings it to the next level with fresh and carefully layered ingredients. High quality meats, veggies and zesty sauce. I could say that pretty much everything here is homemade or close to it; the bread is absolutely fantastic, the perfect kind of bread for a hefty sandwich. The soups and salad dressings seem to be made in house, and it shows in the best kind of way. They also offer locally sourced Cold Bloom Coffee bottled in beautiful glass bottles. This place is very intentional in its efforts to use green practices, which can't be said for a lot of restaurants. They encourage recycling with separate trash cans and much of their packaging is either recyclable or compostable. They also consider themselves to be a \"no-waste\" kitchen, which I understand to mean they only order as much ingredient as they expect they will need for that day to cut down on food waste. Oftentimes this means they will run out of their daily special, but if you're like me you can appreciate how Herb n' Twine seeks to set itself apart with these little changes to mainstream restaurant culture. 

TL;DR- this place has a lot going for it- great service, plenty of seating, green restaurant practices and some awesome sandwich artistry... you're missing out if you don't give it a try!"}
