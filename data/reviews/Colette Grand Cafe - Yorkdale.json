{"text":"The service this past Sunday was very good! Our server was attentive in refilling our coffees and waters and our food was served it good time. The atmosphere is nice and the decor chic and elegant. 

I ordered the dungeonous crab, shrimp omelette but unfortunately it had a strong \"fishy/ seafood\" taste- to th repoint where I felt I wanted to squeeze some lemon over the whole thing. The portion was a good size, it's too bad the taste was sub-par. Three others in our party ordered the omelette and the feedback was similar. One ordered the pancakes and said it was on the soggy side and seemed somewhat undercooked.

I was also really looking forward to having pain au chocolat which the downtown location made perfectly- light and flaky and not overly butter. Unfortunately, they did not have it and while there were other pastries to choose from, they didn't sell it enough and I passed on it. 

I do hope they improve their food, it's very disappointing that the food quality declined vs the downtown location and they are located In Holt Renfrew no less where I would expect much more."}
{"text":"We went to Colette for Sunday brunch for a friends birthday.
They did not have our table ready even after I made reservations.  We waited almost 25 mins for a table.   When we were seated we waited 15 mins for our water!  The cappuccino was cold.  Finally when our party arrived we ordered our food and was noticed they were out of avocado toast. How is that possible????? Two hours after you open for brunch you're out of an item!!! I was looking forward to ordering that. I ended up ordering the mushroom toast which I loved.  They took forever bringing anything.  There were only two servers!!! 
Overall loved the food hated the service!  Mushroom toast and a cappuccino ran me $31"}
{"text":"Friday night, I figured I am bored and wanted to try something new. 

I ordered the Omelette with Dungeness crab, shrimp and tobiko, I couldn't really taste the shrimp. I find the egg over cooked.  However, there is a good portion of crab inside. 

The mimosa was not bad.  The ambiance is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"\"wow! This place is so sweet.\"

What time we arrived/Wait time?
I went here on a Weekday morning. It wasn't busy and we got seated ASAP for brunch!

Atmosphere?
This place reminds me of a doll house. It's really pleasant and sweet. It's inside the Holt Renfrew so there are no windows which means no natural light which made me feel a tad boxed in. Other than that, it was a very beautiful and minimalistic decor. The couch seats with the pillows reminded me of restoration hardware!

Service/Staff?
The service was amazing for one main reason. The manager was so involved and continued to check up on us often. We weren't going to order dessert so we asked for the bill. The manager came out and gave us a free dessert and told us it's on the house because he wanted us to have a really special day because we looked so happy to be there. Amazing/sweet man!

Food/Menu?
The food was great! I got the omlette and mimosas. Very standard. Decently priced!"}

Came here for brunch with my girlfriend - initially we were supposed to go to the Wellington location but they recently closed that place :( we heard they had a location open inside Holt at Yorkdale so decided to try that place.

Service was nice but a bit slow - there weren't enough staff for all the tables and when we needed something it took a while to find the staff. 

I ordered the Dungeness crab omelette and my friend ordered the chef's salad. The omelette was great! Large chunks of crabmeat and they also came with a Rosti and side salad... portions are a lot on this plate and I was quite stuffed!

My friend had the chef salad and really enjoyed it - ingredients are fresh, she didn't like blue cheese so they gave her a different dressing.

Coffee is well made and I had more than a few cups. We also had a side croissant - freshly baked and fluffy, and the fresh orange juice was nice!

We finished with a creme brûlée and it was great! I love the shallow dish so you get a lot of crusted sugar :) it was so nice of the manager to give it to us on the house, he wanted to put a little sign of congrats as my friend is about to have her baby and asked us to get another dessert on the house but since we were too full they took the creme brûlée off the bill!

It's a decent brunch place, but it is difficult that I have to go all the way into Holt just to get it. I'm still really sad the Thompson hotel location closed before I had a chance to actually try to eat there. Knowing how crazy"}
{"text":"Decided to choose this spot for a Brunch with girlfriends on a Sunday.

Upon arriving,  I wasn't wowed by the restaurant. The decor was modern and simple with very nice pastel colouring throughout, like I said, nothing spectacular.

The waitresses are very pleasant but they do-not always come around. The food on the other hand was not good at all.

I ordered the Harvest Salad and it lacked serious flavour. Their was no dressing and I didn't like the concoction of ingredients. I ordered some fries and they were below average as well.

It is conveniently located inside Yorkdale mall but I would not go out of my way to brunch here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place; but the experience was disappointing, at best, if I try to get myself excited about this place.

Circumstances : I booked this place for a belated Father's Day celebration. Reservation process was very easy and I liked that they called a few days in advance to confirm the reservation, in addition to confirming any special request/needs (eg - High chair required) 

Tip to parents: Colette Grand Cafe does not offer any booster seats, only high chairs.

The space is quite nice and decorated nicely, and they did want they could to give the place enough light; despite being surrounding by Holt Renfrew - Yorkdale retail space. Seating is comfortable, although washrooms are not located within the space and you would need to leave the restaurant to use the Holt's general restrooms.

Food is pretty much the major stumbling factor here. 

The menu is ok and while I am disappointed to learn that the Brunch menu was available on Saturday mornings with no regular menu being offered. I ,also,found the menu a little bit limiting and not very inspiring. 

What food was prepared, we found was under-seasoned, bland. My party ordered the following: Seafood Omelette, Roast Chicken, Baked Eggs and their burger.

The Roast Chicken was under-cooked; while we had sent it back to the kitchen for more cooking; it looks like they merely reheated it in a microwave and re-plated. 

The Baked Eggs was ok, if a little bland. 

The Seafood Omelette and burger was ok - just not really noteworthy in any way.

Pricing is moderate, but on the higher end of the lunch pricing spectrum.

Service is good, our server was occasionally hard to find; but overall she wasn't too bad. She did give us a petite four plate as compensation for the disappointing chicken. 

Overall, this place is ok; but the question of whether or not I would make a return visit. This place isn't on the the top of my places to return to  and enjoy, at least, for a Saturday Occasion meal."}
{"text":"--------------
It's been a couple days since we had our experience at Colette...and today received a very apologetic call from the manager, explaining that they were short 5 or so staff and inviting us back for an opportunity to make it right, which is a classy move. Not sure when we'll be able to make it back, but will update my review when that happens."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good reviews about the Colette grand cafe at Thompson hotel and was exciting to try the new Yorkdale location. I came here with a few girlfriends for Saturday brunch. The decor was modern and chic, definitely instagrammable. The menu items were what you would expect but on the pricier side. The service was slow. We had to ask a couple of times before they found us our server to take the order.  We waited for another 20 mins for our food and we were quite hungry by then. 

We had two omelettes ($20 each) and two benedicts ($18 each). Both came with rosti and a half baked tomato. The egg benedicts were completely cold, seemed like they had been sitting around for a while before arriving the table. One of the omelettes was super runny/watery and the flavours were so so. Overall, the dishes looked way better than they tasted. Not sure if we will revisit this location in the near future."}
{"text":"I visited this new location over the long weekend. The decor is similar to the old Colette but a lot more stylish. Right off the bat, I was made to feel welcome by the friendly servers, who offered me a seat at the bar. They seem to know the regulars by their first name, which signifies their attention to detail. If you are in Yorkdale mall and want some quiet time and non pretentious service, then this spot is right for you."}
{"text":"I love the food at Colette on Wellington so I was excited to try Yordale location. We ordered the linguine with mussels, shrimps and clams and a burger. The service was quite slow, it took a while to get a glass of wine and then the meals. My daughter asked for a salad with her burger, instead she got fries. We don't like to complain so she just ate it. Linguini was overcooked, little on the dry side with the tomato sauce. The worst thing was that the mussels were completely uncooked and raw. When notified the waitress, with annoyed face, she tooked the food without saying anything. Another waiter(maybe manager) came out arguing that the mussels are cooked according to the chef. I didn't want to argue, asked for the same dish without the mussels. This time pasta still overcooked but more flavour and tasted much better. Apparently it was cooked by another chef. The guy brought out the forgotten salad when we were almost done, so casually without an apology. We were both very disappointed with the service and food, will not be returning."}
{"text":"WTF happened to their quality?? 

Their Sunday brunch by the Thompson hotel was amazing (environment, food quality, service)...

We went to their Yorkdale mall location (...inside a holy renfrew) -- nothing special, decor/environment  ultra boring, food was absolutely mediocre.

Seriously, did they sell the Collette brand to some new company?? The overall experience and food has dropped tremendously... very disappointed and will not be returning 

Hope someone opens an epic brunch buffet again soon :/"}
