{"text":"I thought I'd pop in for a quick breakfast. Waitress staff was slow, 10 minutes to even order at the counter. Cheesy Hash-browns were cold and unappetizing (served in an ice cream scoop fashion). Eggs and toast were OK. Probably will pass on breakfast here again, but I have enjoyed their dinner menu in the past."}
{"text":"Came to visit my husband who works up here. Had breakfast here not once but twice!!! Everything was delicious,  especially the pancakes!!! Love their bacon & the toast was really crunchy...not burnt at all. Love it & will definitely be back before I leave to go back home."}
{"text":"Location:  rather convenient, right off the highway.  just take the highway instead of the Steubenville Pike when you come this way, there's a 6-way traffic light that's both a long-wait and confusing.  Unless you're a local, then in that case you know how to traverse this little corner of Imperial's outskirts.  Facilities:  you can tell this Kings is a bit out dated right off the bat.  We're not talking \"falling apart old\" but there's that slightly musty smell and depending on where you sit you might get hit by a potent (but thankfully fleeting) wave of deodorizer cleaner that makes you feel like you're sitting close to the restrooms.  Sounds a lot more poetic than it really was, and thankfully it didn't prolong for too long.  Food:  now this was actually SUPER good.  Our party ordered:  Boneless Teriyaki Wings, Buffalo Chicken Salad (2x), and Turkey Open Faced sandwich.  The wings were perfectly seasoned and breaded.  The two salads were made with fresh veggies and scrumptious chicken, and the gravy poured all over the open faced sandwich was rather tasty.  The girls ordered dessert.  It looked good but after a long day of eating all over town I honestly couldn't muster a bit.  They got the cinnamon sticks sundae.  If it tasted half as good as it looked, it would have been stellar.  In conclusion! (I hate when speakers use this phrase, haha.)  If it wasn't for the array of non-food smells that played games with my head as to what exactly I was wafting ... it could have been a 3 or 4 star experience.  I'm hoping on a return visit the smells wouldn't be present 'cus then it'll be PERFECT since the food was GREAT, the value is UNBEATABLE, and the service was STELLAR."}
{"text":"I stopped in here tonight on my way back to PGH after seeing a show at the First Niagara Pavilion.  Because we'd had an early dinner, my dining companion and I were a bit hungry, and this place fit the bill as a quick and inexpensive non-fast food meal.  We came in at 10:15pm, and the restaurant was nearly empty, but the hostess confirmed they were still serving (the hours posted on the door said they're open until 11pm on Sat.).  Having never been to King's before, I ordered the Frownie sundae, since I was hungry for dessert and felt that I needed to try King's signature item (the Frownie--a brownie with a frowning face piped onto it!).  When the sundae came out, it was larger than I expected, but the first thing I noticed was that my frownie was missing an eye!  I found this amusing and pointed it out to my waitress, and she apologized, but I told her not to worry about it.  The sundae was quite good, and definitely hit the spot for my dessert craving.  In particular, I enjoyed the Frownie, which tasted fudgy and delicious (and not at all stale, despite it being the last hour of service!) despite its missing eye.  My dining companion ordered the French Toast breakfast sandwich, which consisted of an egg, some cheese, and a slice of bacon.  He said it was quite good as well, and seemed to enjoy it, other than taking the eggs off (he doesn't eat eggs, and forgot to tell them to leave it off).  Our waitress (Nicole, I believe?) was quite friendly, despite it being her last hour on the clock.  She did forget to bring us napkins and I had to catch her eye to ask for a water refill, but she was responsive about correcting these mistakes, which we appreciated.  Overall, this is a nice alternative to the usual fast food options if you're in the area and craving some eats.  Sure, it's not the greatest meal you'll ever eat, but if all you're looking for is some filling grub or dessert, it hits the spot.  Based on my experience tonight, I'd be willing to return to this or another King's.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Maybe you should hire people who understand work ethic.  Waited to be seated, noticed a customer get up to get their own menu and the whole time watched two girls bullshitting at the counter.. making eye contact and still no one came over. Walked out, it's been ages since I've been to a kings and my fiance never had been, never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Fish and sweet potato fries are great but 1/2 price dessert \"Happy Hour\" is splendid!"}
