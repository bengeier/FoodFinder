{"text":"The BEST dirty chai! Lattes are always way too hot but that is the only complaint I have. Everything I've tried is good. Bacon maple donuts and the breakfast sandwiches are delish."}
{"text":"Came in a Saturday morning and was pleasantly surprised to find a large assortment of bagels, danish, and donuts. 

The people were friendly and the atmosphere was quiet. It's a great place to go with friends to have a nice breakfast. 

The garlic bagel with plain cream cheese that I had was fantastic. The bagel was soft and light with a firm crust. I generally prefer a more dense bagel dough but this was really good. The cream cheese was fresh and had a bright flavor that complimented the bagel perfectly. It was awesome and I'll be back here early tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"I was a fan the minute I walked in. The employees were so nice and personable. The amount of baked goods was overwhelming (in a good way)! I chose the cinnamon roll and it was SO good! Melted in my mouth and the icing was out of this world. It tasted like a cream cheese icing. I also had a coconut mocha, which was delicious. Much better than what you get at a chain. You pay 50 cents more for a syrup, but it is worth it. 

The prices were very fair. It was quiet inside and the decor was beautiful. I will be back soon... I had my eye on the carrot cake cupcake. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I come to Faith's at least once a week! We love it! You have to get their bacon egg and cheese bagel. It's always so delicious. I don't think we've ever had anything we didn't like from Faith's. Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Went here while in town on business after reading reviews.  As good as billed.  Friendly staff, happy customers eating there and waiting in line, good doughnuts (plain glazed and the bacon doughnut were the highlights for this trip), clean.  Have Faith!"}
{"text":"A great hometown bakery! I love finding these types of places tucked in and around Charlotte. With comfortable seats, a clean and fresh atmosphere and yummy desserts, you can't go wrong! The prices are more than fair and everything has been fresh. This is a nice quiet place to go for a doughnut (or two) to share and a glass of milk to wash it down. Don't expect a Starbucks or coffee house vibe. This isn't it and for that, I am grateful! It's a family place but yes, the coffee is great too."}
{"text":"We were worried about Faith when the corporate place opened up down the road, but happily, this place is going strong and better than ever.  Their bagels are fresh, crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside, just the way a great bagel should be.  Donuts are made fresh and served with a smile.  This is our go-to place on Sunday mornings.  I can't fathom why anyone in the Harrisburg area would choose the national donut-chain over this fine bakery, but to each, his own, I suppose.  I grew up in New York eating from the \"other\" place, but no more.  Faith is better in every regard."}
{"text":"I love the variety of baked goods offered.  The cinnamon apple filled donut, banana nut muffin and tomato basil bagel are among my favorites.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  

Today I had to remove two stars.  I come in four days a week and had not been offered a punch card for a free donut.  I had to ask for one.  Not the way to do business with someone who was been a loyal patron."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Great prices and love all the options. The donuts could be a little better but the asiago cheese bagel and cappuccino were delicious!"}
{"text":"It's so wonderful to have a local bakery in Harrisburg. It's very clean and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  Donuts are delicious and fresh. They have a variety of other baked goods...but the whoopie pies!!!  The whoopie pies are absolutely phenomenal!!!! They are huge and fresh and perfectly made. I bought 5 to take to a get-together.  I quartered them and they displayed nicely in a platter.  Kids and adults raved at how delicious they were.  Get over there and buy some whoopie pies!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here for lunch and both times they were extremely skimpy on the amount of meat they put on the sandwiches. The first time I got a turkey sandwich and the second time I got the chicken salad and each time there wasn't even enough to cover the bread.   Great place for sweets but not for lunch."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Two large pastry cases filled with doughnuts, cupcakes, muffins, and other pastries. There is also a coffee bar. Everything was fresh and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Been here more than couple times now for quick breakfast before running errands, great bagels, great treats, and great coffee!!!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating differs from our regular review of restaurants to a cafe making outstanding doughnuts and breakfast sandwiches in Harrisburg, Faith Coffee & Sweets. This neighborhood gathering spot was packed on our Saturday morning visit with the kiddos all standing at the doughnut case picking out their favorites.

Dora here. Hmmm. Looks to be plenty of adults, too, Ernie. lol. Check out this sugar heaven!

I started with a Ham, Egg & Cheese sandwich on a toasted English Muffin. The sandwich was huge, tasty, and too much to eat with six doughnuts sitting on the table.

Dora here. Six doughnuts. Ohhhh....but, before you think we're crazy-or gluttons, lol- we only planned to taste one bite from each and save the rest for the next day. 

We selected a pumpkin spice, maple bacon, Reese's, and chocolate mocha, all yeast doughnuts, and a coconut and cinnamon sugar cake doughnut. All were great. My favorite was the maple bacon (everything is better with bacon) and the sugar cake doughnut which is always a \"go to\" doughnut for me.

Dora here. We each picked three and do I have to tell you how difficult that was? And all those exotic choices and he picks cinnamon sugar. Really, Ernie? I'd been craving a pumpkin doughnut since Halloween and I finally got one. That was my favorite. Melt-in-your-mouth, similar to a Krispy Kreme fresh from the oven. The coconut was soooo good, with a hint of...citrus? Yum! Good thing this place is a few miles away or we'd be hanging out with all the other regulars on Saturday mornings. lol. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Family friendly bakery! Great customer service and they keep it very interesting with something new all the time! There bagels are the best I've had since I moved here 13yrs ago!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, couldn't ask for a better caf√©, I ordered the cinnamon roll and some donuts for the kids, they were all delicious (of course I always \"sample\" what my kids are eating, I tell them \"they are my prices and I  am their royal taster.\" Win win). This was late in the day and not a hint of staleness in the pastries. I will definitely be back. I should probably give them 5 stars but I always leave room for improvement"}
{"text":"Very clean shop with helpful and friendly staff and  I LOVE their variety of sweets such as donuts, muffins, pies and pastries . There Carmel frappuccino was especially good too!!"}
{"text":"I had a hair appointment across the street at step and shine salon. While waiting for my hairdresser to show up I saw this breakfast place and I noticed plenty cars were turning into their lot. The good thing was, I was hungry so I decided to go check it out. I had their sausage, egg and cheese croissant and it was so good. Dunkin' Donuts ain't got nothing on them. I'd definitely be back there cause I want to try so much more."}
{"text":"To celebrate National Donut Day, I popped into this shop for a couple of donuts. I ordered a lemon-filled donut and an apple fritter (because I celebrate Fat Fridays lol). To my amazement, the lemon-filled donut was lightly sweetened with just a hint of lemon flavor. The apple fritter tasted like a standard fritter should, nearly identical to what I would pick up from Harris Teeter. This is not a complaint, but I was expecting a richer, more homemade taste from this local shop. 

I do plan on visiting again to try coffee or a bagel, as this shop does also offer cakes, cupcakes, cannolis, pastries, cookies, bars, and more."}
{"text":"Got tired of Starbucks and decided to try something different. Here we go-

Good coffee. Sweets- Plenty to choose from: cupcakes, donuts, muffins, bagels, etc.  drinks? Yes. Sodas, coffees.  Donuts- Maple bacon, Oreo, long johns, jelly filled, etc. Heavenly.  

Friendly staffs. Very clean store. Why haven't I found this place until today. That is the only downside. Family oriented place as well. 

Ordered some cupcakes and a coffee.  A little bit dry but still very good. Try this place if you are in the area. 

Good place to bring your laptop and study or work. This place offers secured wifi.  I mean who does that anymore.  Impressed!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely local coffee and and baked goods shop. They have all kinds of coffee which I was so impressed with. I really thought they'd just have coffee but they have lattes and cappuccinos.  Try the latte you'll love it plus they have tons of flavors. 

Their cupcakes are the best I've seen/had in Charlotte. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors! 

Friendly staff, great cupcakes and coffees, it's a go to for sure."}
{"text":"Donuts and cupcakes are very fresh and very good! It get's better each time I come back. Took one start away just cause they need to work on their branding a bit. The inside is kind of a hodge podge of decor. Pick one and roll with it all the way! I think it would just elevate them!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The donuts are the best, the people are nice, and they're always open! This is a great place to go when you need that 'before work donut and coffee.'"}
{"text":"Great variety of baked goods.  Best breakfast sandwiches in the area.  Much better bang for your buck than Starbucks or Dunkin donuts"}
{"text":"Best coffee shop.  Period.  The chai tea cupcake was amazing as well as the iced mocha.  I will be coming back here frequently.  I could not recommend it more!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and love it. My wife found the place when in the area as we do not live close by. But the 20 minute drive is worth it if you have to have donuts or bagels. I wish there was one on the Concord Huntsville town line around Poplar Tent Rd."}
{"text":"\"Cuz I gotta have faith, faith, faith.\" I doubt very much this was the type of faith George Michael was referring to in that song but let's just go with it :)

But seriously, if it's a weekend morning, I have got to have something from Faith. I've had some of their pastry offerings but I usually come in for the bagels. The prices of their bagel sandwiches are the cheapest I've paid in the area yet still delicious. 

The shop does get very busy with families during peak Saturday morning hours so pack your patience and come ready with your order!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome and very out going. All the families that were there were sooo sweet. 
They have a huge selection on everything but come early cause there delicious bagels get gone very quickly. All the donuts look soooo yummy I feel like a 5-year old trying to decide which one to get. 
I would have taken some pictures of the selection but I was sooo excited to get out of the car I left it in my car. 
I will be going back even though I'm in east Charlotte and have no business being on that side of town that now have Serious business of a reason.
This surely a must place to go!"}
{"text":"Went here today because I was in Harrisburg and it had good reviews. Was hoping to get something sweet for my daughter and myself. Went in and was greeted and was promptly. They weren't busy since it was afternoon during a weekday. Ordered some cupcakes got a cookie for my daughter and my mom ordered a piece of pie. Left the place with our purchases and decided to try them. The cupcakes were awful not fresh at all. They were hard and dry and tasted chemically. The cookie was no better and the pie was like something you would buy in the grocery store. After reading all the reviews I was so disappointed that it was so bad. Never will do it again!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Faith Coffee and Sweets. I had an extremely pleasant time.  I am visiting from AZ. The wait staff was kind and patient. The coffee smooth and very flavorful. And THEN...the 'carrot raisin' muffin...oh my, was totally what I would call 'FANTABULOUS'!!! So much flavor and nice and moist. I wish I would have been hungrier as the pastry/donuts looked so  DEVINE. I would highly recommend it to any and all!  O-YUM-O!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice little donut shop right in Harrisburg!

This place has it all, everyday!  Donuts, cupcakes, cake....gluten free options too!!  Also a full coffee shop and has some sandwiches too!

Come here for donuts, not their breakfast sandwiches.  The sandwich was good but tiny for the price.  The donuts are awesome!  They have every kind of donut you would want and you won't be disappointed!  The owners are also super nice"}
{"text":"Give me a break. This place is below average. The cupcakes are awful. Cold, not fresh. The doughnuts are mediocre at best. I had \"faith\", but they didn't deliver."}
{"text":"I found this place searching for the closest place to get donuts in relation to my neighborhood. It's not very close, but not too far from university city/ north east Charlotte. The bakery is located off highway 49 in Harrisburg and offers a variety of desserts and baked goods. I went for the donuts. My favorite were the chocolate glazed, definitely a little better than the grocery store version . When I arrived , they were all out of the red velvet donut, which made me a little sad ."}
{"text":"The best donuts in the area.  Awesome flavor and texture.   Maple bacon is phenomenal. ...melts in your mouth.  Cinnamon roll is among the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment several times... 

I definitely recommend this little gem for coffee or donuts in the 'burg! 

*they are NOT open 24/7 as the listing suggest 
*excellent selection of donuts and bagels 
*prices are reasonable (more than McD coffee, less than S-bucks)
*parking is small
*free decent wi-fi
*entire staff is always friendly! 

Give'em a visit!

{"text":"Best doughnuts ever! Friendly, courteous staff. Tasty food. We love Faith!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I stopped eating donuts (other than Krispy Kreme) years ago! But my husband would occasionally bring donuts home for the kids, he told me how good they were and I finally broke down and tried them... Fresh & Delicious!!! I am a believer and their cupcakes, while expensive are good too! The red velvet is a tasty treat!"}
{"text":"PLEASE READ!  I GAVE THIS PLACE 4 STARS FOR THE DONUTS ONLY!

This place was definitely on my girlfriend and I's list to check out, and the last time I visited her was when I finally decided to make it happen.  You have to understand that I have a pretty high standard for donuts, coming from Charlottesville (there is a place named Spudnuts that just cannot be beat - my girlfriend, who is from Fayettville, where Krispy Kreme was founded, was, in fact, better than Krispy Kreme).  That being said, I think we definitely both have pretty high standards when it comes to donuts.

Walking into this place, there was a lot to look at, something that always gets me.  KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)!  Especially since my eyes are bad in the morning, I found the menu incredibly difficult to read and the prices were confusing (I guess this comes from the fact that they definitely had a large variety of sweets to choose from).  Once we got our order down, we also chose a sandwich and two drinks to complete our survey of an order.  Looking around the place, there really was a lot going on.  I definitely get the impression that this is the type of place where most people get their food to go, and most people have been there enough to know their order by heart.

This place is officially named \"Faith, Coffee and Sweets,\" meaning that faith is included in the experience, and this place is most likely associated with a church (something that does not necessarily set well with me - I believe that business should be able to partner with other organizations, but should not be run completely by an organization).  There was a stand of books as well, all of which were most likely religious, and when we sat down, there was a bulletin board behind us that had all kinds of religious announcements, even personal ads from Christian women.  With all of this going on, as well as the uncomfortable feeling I got when I did not know what to order but seemed to get nothing from the associate except for a sense of urgency, I just felt really out of place.

The donuts were all impeccable in taste, which was the best part.  They definitely have some great flavors, all of which are done incredibly well, I think.  The rest, I think, was relatively mediocre.  The egg sandwich was definitely nothing special, and I am pretty sure that the egg was frozen.  The drinks were alright, but definitely were priced fairly high for what we received.

I am attributing the fact that experience was not the best overall to the fact that my girlfriend and I were probably not in the best mood when we visited this establishment.  Otherwise, we may have liked it better, if only for the taste of the donuts.  I definitely did not have the best time in this place, though, and was looking forward to leaving from the time I got there, for whatever reason.  Thus, since I believe that the donuts were the focus of this place, I have given it a relatively high rating.  Just be ready to pay the price for these treats!"}
{"text":"This place has closed down. I was quite shocked when I pulled up to locked doors. Don't understand they were great."}
{"text":"I really like this little shop, great sweet treats and doughnuts. Everybody is friendly and it has a nice small independent shop feeling."}
{"text":"Best fresh donuts around...always a hit.  It's a regular stop for our staff treats at church."}
{"text":"This place is hands down our favorite Sweets place. 
You MUST try their donuts. They are to die for."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend this place. They have a wide variety of donuts that aren't sold in Dunkin or Krispy Kreme. Also, best price in town."}
{"text":"Love the coffee, chai tea, cupcakes, sesame cashew bars, the place and the customer service! Order a cake from them for my daughters bday and the cake decorator was so accommodating. Faith's is a favorite spot for our family"}
{"text":"WOW! I am amazed by how delicious the confections at this cute little shop! My coworker brings these little bits of dectableness in to work frequently! I am a big fan of the original glazed doughnuts and they ARE better than Krispy Kreme! I promise you. They also have the tastiest canoli and scrumptious bagel and schmear. 
Unfortunately, I haven't tried all that they have to offer but I love that they offer Gluten Free items. If you are in the area, definitely visit for they will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We love this place 
Great coffee and doughnuts and very friendly owner 
We need to support local owned businesses such as this...."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I haven't tried out this place sooner. The quality of their baked goods are great! This place is really a neighborhood gem! It reminds me of the bakeries I know and love back in New York. Cupcakes, Birthday Cakes, pastries, donuts....you name it, they probably have it! 

I love the ambience. Very quiet, with some Christian decorations. The bakery more than likely is owned by a Christian family.

I will definitely come here more often. Supporting local businesses is something I enjoy doing."}
{"text":"By far one of the best looking coffee spots I have visited. The family atmosphere and nice ladies makes it worth trying
It is a place that just has all the right  touches. 
Only thing for me that loses being 5star. Is it is process eggs, which changes the taste and the half a pieces of ham uses on my sandwhich. The bagel was very fresh and the bowtie was really good.

But I will try another place tomorrow. But this has 5 star potential and is worth coming in for sweets. They are awesome."}
{"text":"Usually I love this place, Today not so much. I ordered a half dozen donuts, few pastries, and bagel sandwich. The donut I had was stale, another donut the girl had put in the box crumbled in my hand as soon as I picked it up and was the size of a small onion ring, ended up just throwing it away. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Wanted a coffee shop with Internet to do my homework since the libraries aren't open on Sunday's. Decided to try this place since I have driven past every morning on my way to work. Great little spot for a sweet treat and something to drink, plus free wifi! Prices are reasonable, they have a large selection and the staff is very friendly. I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"This a great coffee and dessert place! They also have breakfast sandwiches.  It was so delicious.  I got an everything bagel & a cheese Danish to try. The cupcakes are really good, as well, strawberry is my favorite.  The staff is so friendly & helpful!  A very welcoming environment.   The chai latte is a MUST. I will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Listen,  my kids aren't  donut aficionados.  Pretty much anything sweet for breakfast is going to be a great thing!  But I knew I was on to something when they exclaimed that the donuts here were better than Dunkin's!"}
{"text":"Always friendly to my wife and daughters. Great cupcakes and coffee. One of my favorite places around."}
{"text":"The donuts are EXCELLENT! And, the staff is very friendly (except the owner, who comes across short and arrogant). However, the cupcakes are subpar. I've made better from a box mix. But by all means, order the donuts."}
{"text":"This little shop is great! Especially for someone who cannot have any gluten! I went here in hopes to find something sweet after having dinner with a friend, and I was very happy to see they had lots of options. 

GF cupcakes (chocolate and vanilla), brownies, lemon bars, coffee cakes, to name a few. The lady working there was very sweet and knew a lot about Celiac disease because her mom struggles with it. She was able to point me in the right direction when it came to coffee flavors, remembering what her mom could and couldn't drink from there.

I had a GF chocolate cupcake and a caramel iced coffee. The coffee was okay, but I should've gone with my gut and gotten just a hot coffee to go with my cupcake. The cupcake was amazing! So moist (which is hard to come by with GF) and it was a good size. Not tiny like some sweet shops make them.

If you're not gluten intolerant, there are tons more options available. They also make homemade donuts, and if you check in on Facebook, you get a free one! The only complaint I have is that while all of the gluten free cakes/brownies were individually wrapped and set aside, the cupcakes were in the same case as all of the other gluten goodies. They should be separated to avoid cross contamination. 

I'm sad that this place is over an hour from me. I plan on visiting again the next time I'm in Concord."}
{"text":"We came here and immediately were greeted by one of the persons behind the counter. She was friendly and had a smile on her face. I asked what the most popular donut was she said they all are but her favorite was the oreo. We got a variety. Since it was my youngests special day we got a blueberry muffin too. I had coffee and hubby some kind of frappaccino. The girl was patient with us as two indecisive children made their final picks. I noticed they also had bread (I make my own weekly so I appreciate a fellow bread baker) not on the menu. The venue got busy after we sat. I was surprised how many people came in. The girl behind the counter said this was slower than normal. I am surprised. I also noticed the menu now includes a Faith Bbq sandwich, macaroni and cheese, baked beans and a few other items but we did not try those this time. 
On to the doughnuts...
I like the maple flavor of the maple glazed and the maple bacon. It was very flavorful. The doughnuts were ok. They were not as light as I prefer but not oversized gobs of dough either. It was good. Not the best and definitely not the worst I have had in Charlotte. I would ho back just because of the variety and the fantastic service. Anyone that can stay friendly without being fake while five of us make our decisions on doughnuts,drinks, and if we wanted other things is amazing. 
I will still be searching for a great doughnut but for the meantime I will take this place to serve hubbys sweet tooth in between my baking fetishs."}
{"text":"The cupcakes here are horrible...they looked good but taste dry...definitely store bought..I hate the other place up the street from them moved ...ugh"}
{"text":"The doughnuts are great but the staff has no clue what anything is or what the stuff is made with!! I love the place but please educate your staff!!"}
{"text":"Now I see why it was voted one of the Beast Donut shops in the Charlotte area!

Great selection of very yummy donuts and their cupcakes are so good!!! Oh, did I mention they serve fresh sandwiches on homemade bread and fresh coffee and tea? 

It's my new goto place in Harrisburg. The staff is so friendly and prompt. I highly recommend it!"}
