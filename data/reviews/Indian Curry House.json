{"text":"brandnew. spicy!!  Die junge Familie ist sooo stolz auf ihr neues Restaurant und das mit Recht. Authentische Küche mit interessanter Würzung. Eine nicht so große Karte deutet auf Frische und tagesaktuelle Zubereitung hin.  Ein Tandoori-Ofen ist natürlich auch vorhanden. Das Lokal im Oberstock ist einfach, aber gemütlich eingerichtet. Indische Musik macht Atmosphäre. Uns hat das von der Inhaberin selbst entworfene Logo gleich angesprochen.  Herrlich das wunderbare Naan-Brot, auch die Vorspeisen kreativ. Es gibt täglich ein günstiges lunch Gericht, und Fleisch und Fisch nach indischer Rezeptur.  Insgesamt speist man hier preiswert. Auch die Desserts entbehren nicht einer kreativen Note.   Viel Erfolg der jungen Familie! Und den Besuchern viele schöne Geschmacks Erlebnisse. Ja, und das mit den leuchtenden Augen stimmt auch!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended lunch place!!  I saw some good reviews and stopped here for lunch. For lunch they have pre-fixe thali options, we tried the Chennai and Lucknow thali. Since this more of a South Indian restaurant, do highly recommend the chennai thali. Lucknow was good too but no match for the chennai thali. The chicken curry in the thali was really authentic, I live in New Jersey and there are very few places here too which have such authentic chettinad curry, not too spicy just perfect. We ordered extra breads which were fluffy and soft. We also tried their Lassi(flavored yogurt) and as in most Indian restaurants these days you have the mango lassi option , but they also have a strawberry option which was really good."}
{"text":"I am going to start by saying my husband I came here and we were very hungry and excited to try a new Indain place with great reviews. We tried so hard to give this place every chance and they just kept under delivering and showing us they did not care about the customers. With a total of twenty customers in the place and most who had food when we arrive we simply do not understand why the service was so bad.We arrived for lunch around 12:30 and left around 2 unsatisfied.   Around 12 we arrive. It started out okay we sat down and the woman set our flatware and water glasses. She brought out a carafe of water and our menus and left. No red flags yet.  About 5 minutes later she came back and got our drink order of a mango lassi and chai tea. We got those around 15 minutes later and she left. Did not even ask us if were ready to order. (red flag 1) So we flagged her down a couple of times and she kept pushing us off. (red flag 2  and 3) She kept telling us she would be by soon but she never got close to our table. Around 30 minutes later she comes by to take our order of two Kashmir Thalis.    Around 15 minutes after we finally ordered we got our cold food and no naan. The naan took 5 minutes extra to come out room temperature.  Not 1 dish was hot or even warm. The Chicken Tika and Lamb Rogan Josh are typically hot or at least warm. Not here they are both room temperature and salty.  The greasy cabbage? dish was also room temperature. Rice was room temperature. The Ratia was cold which is normal. The Halwa was also cold but 90% water and 10% rice. I did not realize Halwa meant watered down rice pudding but at Indian Curry House that is what you get.  Despite all this we were both hungry as we skipped breakfast and we still could not find enjoyment here . So we ate enough to tide us over until dinner.  After we finished eating we sat for awhile and since the waitress never came to our table we walked to the front to pay. She was in a phone call taking an order which took another 5 minutes. I am not upset about this because someone has to answer the phones. I am only upset about bad service and cold food. The bill was 28.12$ before a tip which was smaller than my standard 15-25%.   We wont be back and we recommend any of the various Indian places in town over this place. You can get better food and service at any of them  On the bright side we are going to have lunch at a great Indian buffet tomorrow which always has hot food and good service."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened about 4 months ago and I went there last week to have dinner. It's off the strip but the food is authentic and made fresh but very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for Indian food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We were suggested this location after searching for new Indian Cuisine in the Las Vegas area. The location was easy to find in the heart of China Town. The establishment was clean and well kept. We were greeted by the owner almost immediately upon entrance and seated. Although we live Indian food were not well versed in menu items. The owner was more that willing to make some very tasty food suggestions. We had the Bhaji, Mengu Vada, Chicke  Masala and Roganjosh. All of the good was fresh and flavorful. I would definitely return. Thank you for wonderful pleasant and courteous service."}
{"text":"Awesome food .. and Rama is such a nice lady.  I was a visitor in Vegas didn't expect such great Indian food."}
{"text":"Service is very very bad and slow. Better take time when you go there. The food seems good."}
{"text":"Thali and Biryanis are good. They serve it fresh. I would suggest this restaurant.  Don't rush to get service fast for good food."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant today, service was delayed but was worth waiting. Would have given 5, just because of wait giving 4.5."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent like home cooked food!! Had Chennai and Kashmiri thalis and both were good. Chicken Briyani was delicious. The server was very friendly and provided good service."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 dosas and chicken biryani. Both of them are the worst food I have eaten. Biryani is extremely spicy and chicken had bad taste. Dosa Is saggy and no taste. Should not have visited this place"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with homely food. Went for lunch and owner was flexible to provide multiple breakfast options which we were looking for. Good.option not much away from las vegas blvd ..."}
{"text":"First time I tried coming with my husband for lunch on a Monday and it was closed. We tried yet again to come and it was probably the worst experience at an Indian restaurant. There was no one there but us and their buffet menu is no buffet, you still order from a lunch menu for their \"buffet style\" lunch orders. We sat and ordered our food and it was cold, with very little food in each bowl in the platter. Maybe one or two pieces of meat. The rice was terrible and had zero flavor. We never heard dishes clanking or any type of indication that the food was being made fresh. It all tasted like frozen prepped Indian food.  They didn't even offer us a drink besides tap water in a glass. I told the lady serving us that it was cold and all she said was don't eat it. Then she went in the back and started gossiping about us in her language to another worker. We paid for the food and left very hungry because we couldn't even eat it. I was very excited about giving this place a try but will never come here again."}
{"text":"This is quite simply the best Indian food I've ever tasted! Try the spring dosa. The paneer tikka masala is out of this world too. Lovely staff, convenient location."}
{"text":"Good and simple south Indian thali. You have north Indian options as well but we never tried"}
{"text":"We made our first visit to this relatively new restaurant today.  The owner was very friendly, took time to explain her business philosophy and the food was delicious.  She explained that she doesn't offer the typical buffet at lunch, because not only is it unhealthy (overeating), but it's wasteful.  She does offer sampler plates that begin at $8.50. These plates allow one to sample various dishes without overeating. What a refreshing perspective!  She also offers vegan choices since her food is made to order."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful experience, it is my first time trying Indian food and I was glad to find this restaurant!!  Delicious home style flavors cooked fresh. Super friendly and attentive staffs as well.  Definitely going back. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best curry house in Vegas! Everything is freshly made and not too spicy. I love it. Definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I had in years.  Tandoori chicken was amazing: much more juicy than any other Indian place I ever tried. Excellent tandoori lamb too.  Everything tasted like home-made food.  The owner greeted us and provided great service.  Overall: great dinner experience.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In town trying to figure out someplace new to eat. Found this gem on yelp.   All i can say is the chicken tandoori and roganjosh is awesome.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Indian food is my favorite cuisine, especially for comfort food. I haven't found a go-to spot yet, til now!"}
{"text":"Tried this new Indian place. Predominantly South Indian cuisine. They offer thali (multiple dishes in small portions, pic attached)  at resonable price. We tried Dakshin and kashmir thali. Dakshin thali had sambhar, vada, veg korma, kal dosa, seasonal vegetable and plain yoghurt, reasonably priced at $9.50. Kashmir thali had chicken curry, lamb rogan josh, rice, Roti, raita, papad and seasonal veg. Not a bad deal for $10.50. We also tried dosa and veg biryani both were ok. Masala lacked salt, dosa is not crispy and chutney is very runny and very tiny portion.  Rest of the food tasted average at its best. The rice kheer was terrible.  If you are in the area and just want to eat a quick simple Indian meal, you can give it a shot."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Excellent curry and garlic naan.   Mango lasse was very fresh.  Very reasonable prices.  Nice people!!   Good service"}
{"text":"There aren't many Indian options on my side of town. I gave this place three tries to get their act together, and it went from bad to worse. The woman who works here is rude and hostile, and actively lies to customers and Eat24 staff. All low reviews have poor service in common. Come at your own risk.  FIRST VISIT: Placed appetizer order via Eat24, notified order would take 45 minutes. Arrived after 30 minutes and female cashier flipped out on me, rudely stating there was no way it would be ready within an hour. When I clarified that I'd only ordered an appetizer, she went off on a rant about the ovens. The cook silently brought my order out from the kitchen literally five minutes later, cashier and an apology were nowhere to be found. Tandoori wings were good but samosas were the tiny frozen variety from the grocery rather than the larger ones I expect at restaurants.  SECOND VISIT: This was a wash, because I placed an online order for pickup again only to get texts from Eat24 about how my order wasn't available. I guess it happens sometimes, but I ordered the most basic of Indian dishes, saag paneer. There's a grocery store literally in your parking lot. How does this happen? Strike 2.   THIRD ATTEMPT: Placed an order for mutton biryani. Came in to pick up, same woman said she didn't confirm the order with Eat24, handed me their lunch menu and said I could order now. When I asked about my order, she said it's not her problem and to call Eat24. I asked why she chose not to fill my order knowing I'd be coming in to pick up food and get nothing, essentially wasting my time. She then backtracked and said she didn't know I had placed an order, she was just guessing. She was talking over me and interrupting as I tried to work this out, extremely unprofessional. It seems they're regularly refusing to fill Eat24 orders over some beef with the company. Not my problem, but after wasting my time twice, I will never be back."}
{"text":"The best tasting South Indian food all over USA!  The food was so home made that I order almost three times the same Vegeterian Thali! And just for $8 this is the place to have Indian food if you are in Las Vegas. Wait! Even if you are around Las Vegas do try this restaurant. It's mouth watering and yummy!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for 1) Excellent and friendly service 2) Clean and quiet setting 3) Unabashed dish recommendations and last but not least and most importantly 4) Flavorful food.  We had the samosa chat as an appetizer and both with a bit of embarrassment said the same thing to each other, which is we could lick the bowl.  All the other appetizer dishes looked good as well and will be tried on the next visits.  The Paneer and Vegetable Skewer was also tasty and with a good portion, not over the top.  Lastly, we had the Classic Chicken Curry which was also a perfect portion, good texture, and mix of flavors.  Some may argue for more choices, but it seems quantity in portion size and menu offerings sometimes overshadows quality.  The menu here is not cluttered, simple to choose from, and seems to stress the quality of each dish."}
{"text":"Nehru would be proud as I characterize it as a Discovery of India menu - energetically colorful, well presented and proudly delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious new place in Chinatown! I think this is one of the only few Indian restaurants in town with thali. Ordered the Kashmiri thali and got some bang for ny buck. Comes with chicken tikka, rogan josh, some spicy green bean dish, rice, dessert, yogurt sauce, and delicious naan. The best rogan josh I've ever had! 2 large pieces of meat in the dishes each, but not complaining. I do wish they had an option of letting you choose the vegetable sides and dessert. $10.50 for thali. This would be a great place if youre a vegetarian or GF as well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely phenomenal!!! The food is excellent, the service fantastic, and everything is all around amazing! They even have amazing lunch specials, we will definitely be back!!! Be sure to try the dosa, it is unique and full of amazing flavors!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't serve you beer  Only sodas and water  And the server just stares at people that are eating there food and one of the server just sits down on the table and drinks the coffee and play with her food and they don't come up to the people and ask for more food or other stuff. This restaurant is a fast food place and the samosas are not the regular size and it is the miniature size and they give you only three pieces of samosas and chickpeas"}
{"text":"Every single dish was outstanding. Simply delicious food. If you're looking for great Indian food, you've found the right place."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the Indian Curry House by accident recently. We had  gone to another Indian restaurant that we discovered is now closed, so we were headed to an established restaurant in the Pacific Asian Plaza. Upon pulling into the area, we saw the sign for this new place, so we gave it a try. Glad we did! As others have said, if you want FLAVOR, come here!  We started with the chickpea fritters, and they came out hot & crispy, with a plate of delectable dipping sauces. Make sure you keep those sauces to dip your naan into later! My husband ordered classic chicken curry with  heat of 6, and it was pleasantly tingly without being overpowering. The rice it came with was super fluffy and fresh (this makes a difference...you know how some places serve clumpy or dry rice that's barely edible!). I am not a big fan of turmeric, so I ordered grilled paneer in a sauce that reminded me of Butter Chicken sauce...it was sooooo fragrant with ginger, coriander and other lovely scents. I ordered it with a heat of 4, which was just enough to know the heat was there. Mine came with naan, which was the best we've had! We got piggy and ordered more naan, and a dish of raita so we could try that...later we found that we weren't charged for the extra bread or the raita that we requested!  This family really know how to let their spices bloom...everything was just bursting with scent and flavor. (I am an impatient cook, and my curries sometimes have a \"dusty\" texture from not letting the spices blend long enough. At Curry House, their sauces are soooo smooth.) We even found room for a dish of kheer (rice pudding), which was perfectly flavored with cardamom, just sweet enough, and very cold--which is how it tastes best, in my opinion (although my Indian college room-mate always gobbled most of hers before it cooled down, ha!) My husband and I were in a state of pleasant shock, knowing we had just discovered a gem. I cannot finish without mentioning the friendly service. The only advice I have to this family business: some Indian music playing softly in the background would enhance the experience ;-) I wish them luck...please support this family restaurant...your tastebuds will thank you!!"}
{"text":"food was ok but way too small. with the amount of indian restaurants in vegas, this restaurant has no business charging the crazy prices they do for the tiny amount that they serve!"}
{"text":"Lovely, fresh restaurant with delightful, balanced flavors and very accommodating staff. Check them out!"}
{"text":"A friend and I tried this place after wandering around the block looking for dinner. Seeing the chefs eyes light up as we checked out the menu and decided to come in was perhaps one of the most wholesome things I have seen. Good curries and naan. I tried the chicken tikka masala and the spinach and paneer curry. They were both very good with nice thick sauces. They were tasty and well made. The lassi is good, nice and yogurty. This place is tucked away in a 2nd floor block. It is a small, new place and the staff are eager and ready to serve! There are plenty of worn out curry houses around town, and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"The most rude lady on the phone does not want to tell anything about the foods she has... \"It is Top Secret.\" I asked her what origin your lamb is from and she says \"it is none of your business, how can I tell you that?\" If you are one that asks alot of questions before going to the restaurant, or while ordering, this is not restaurant to go to, everything is Top Secret."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here one night because he was looking for goat curry. We checked out a few other places on yelp and couldn't find any. So while we were driving around we came across this place. I've never had this kind of food before but I'm very open minded so I wanted to try it. The lady here was super nice and helped me pick out what I wanted to eat. She was always on top of making sure our drinks were full and always asked if it was good. Love it! We definitely will be coming back here. I had the chicken that was cooked in a clay pot. It was super flavorful and the meat was so soft. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurant in town.   Located in Chinatown, in the plaza of SF Chinese Supermarket (they are on the second floor). Tips: better to park on the second floor and walk right to the restaurant so you don't have to take the stairs.   What I love about this place is they are not a buffet, unlike other Indian lunch. They prepare the food as you order it so there is no waste, or all day re-heated food. Healthy portion and if you need more, you can always for more bread (naan) or basmati rice.   We were here for lunch. On the side note, they open for lunch from 11-3 and open for dinner from 5-10. They close from 3-5 for dinner prep.   They have five combo of lunch specials! Two of them are Vegetarian options (one of the two is Gluten Free option). I ordered the combo with the chicken curry. The spicy level was spot on. Lunch combo comes with naan bread and papad (crispy, grain and gluten free bread). Delicious, crispy and tasty! It also comes with vegetable of the day. Today they had a spicy green beans with onions and lentil. Yumm. The desert that comes with the lunch combo changes everyday. Today I had Gulan Jamun (a berry sized milk ball dunked in sugar syrup).   Price is reasonable. Lunch combo starts at $9. It is plenty of food for the price.   Place is a bit small and sometimes the service can be slow during busy day. Today I had a great service since it was not busy.   Would defintely come back for lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I have eaten in the US. I tried vegetable biryani. It was sufficent for 2 people and more than that it was too good.  I also tried paneer tikka masala. It comes with a regular naan but I got a garlic naan instead and loved it. You have to try garlic naan here.  Everytime I come to Vegas I am gonna eat at least one meal here"}
{"text":"The mango lassi is amazing!   We ordered the classic chicken curry, chicken tikka masala and the lamb curry. Everything was amazing and full of flavor.   We got med spice and it was not hot for us. So ordering spicy should not be bad to try for next time.   The naan was great, fluffy and big. Loved the texture and the flavor.   The masala chai reminds me of home and my mom. I almost cried. Amazing chai!   All the desserts are amazing! We tried them all in every flavor.   The service was great. The place was clean. The food came out fast. The food is cheap. This place is definitely a gem and needs more exposure. The owner served us and she was adorable and tended to all our needs. Thank you for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Food was good (dosa). The restaurants charges extra for every extra like sambar, rice even when you buy thali. They give literally frozen curd and chutney. You will feel unfortunate to eat that. Bad service motto."}
{"text":"To start, I am impressed that the glasses and silverware are spotless!  My husband had his favorite chicken tikka masala.  It came with naan but not rice so he had to order some.  When it came he devoured it like it was his last meal.  I had the chicken dosa and loved it with all the accompaniments.  Only complaint, our meals came out ten minutes apart, so I was done when he was just starting."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! The spices were very authentic and the perfect amount of spicy. I would highly recommend to anyone - whether you like Indian or have never had it! Had paneer tikka masala, aloo gobi, garlic naan, doma, and more. Lots of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options."}
{"text":"Everything was cooked to order: Subash needs to Stay here in Vegas and watch over his Baby! It's a Hidden Gem now!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Fresh and excellent. The spices were amazing. If you want good Indian food done perfect recommend this restaurant. And the prices are decent to which is always a plus.    Had friends bring takeout from here a while after first time went. Still fantastic. Sometimes skeptical when first time really good. But both times great."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly,helpful service . I went on Friday night and found it wasn't overly busy which in hindsight surprises me. When I sat down , I was approached by a very nice lady who took her time and made some suggestions and answered my questions as I like Indian food but I am not familiar with some of the dishes and accompaniments. I decided to have the chicken briyani and the lady asked about my preferences in regard to spiciness . I told her that I wasn't sure as many places have different ideas what spicy is. She also said she would bring me a side of yogurt to tone down the curry sauce if it was a little too spicy for me .The food came and it was a large portion for what I thought was a reasonable price. The rice had a good texture with some nice pieces of chicken and some onion with chicken curry sauce on the side It was a little spicy but delicious and it turned out I didn't need the yogurt to tone it down. It was just right. I will be making more trips to Indian Curry House. This is my first review on Yelp but as I eat out frequently and use Yelp reviews to find new places , I am going to start reviewing all the places I go."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a weekend at 8:30pm. We had several major concerns.  1. While I ordered using Eat24 - the restaurant seemed to cancel that order and instead insisted on a \"cash\" transaction. It seemed unethical. When asked they said \"oh that's for promotion \".  2. The restaurant was completely empty - another big concern.  3. The food was far below par: A/ paneer tikka had 4 tiny pieces, and to our surprise, a small piece of chicken. It seems that the cook scooped out the chicken and added a few paneer pieces. I think it is a cause of concern, specially since vegetarian folks may have certain expectations. We are not vegetarian however.  B/ the Chennai goat curry was inedible because the meat was tough.  C/ even the gulab jamun was hard and extra sweet.  D/ the rice \"Kheer\" was bland and we did not touch one of the 2 we had.   On top of it the server was rude.  All in all - disgusted. Never again"}
{"text":"Great food, Great flavors. Did visit the restaurant on 3 occasions during our vacation and enjoyed the food each and every time. Would highly recommend to anyone out there who is looking to taste the flavors and enjoy some really good food."}
{"text":"Good taste but horrible experience! 1. Walked in the front door. Nobody came to greet and seat me after waiting for a few minutes. I walked to the front counter and said \"1\". They seated me at a dirty table. The lady brought the menu and water to me but I asked her to first clean the table. 2. I ordered the vegetable curry bowl. The waitress said that only a small bowl of rice comes with it and asked if I wanted naan. I like naan and as a first-timer at this place I thought I would try it. 3. Food came out - surprise - small curry bowl compared to the price. Yes, the rice bowl was small.  4. Naan was okay - not great and not bad. 5. At first I thought the curry was tasty but after a while I was greeted by a constant salty taste. Too much salt?  6. Now the FUN part begins. A. I had to ask the inattentive waitress to bring my check. B. I handed my credit card to her and she took it to the counter. C. She soon came back and mumbled something that they cannot accept my business Visa card because the service fee is too high and asked me for a debit card or another card. I told her \"no, that is my only card\". See did not seem to care and I did not want to cause a commotion so I paid by cash. D. My change came - intentionally she gave me a stack of singles expecting it would make it easier to give her a tip. E. NO TIP! If your policy is to reject my Visa card upon payment because it is a business type and the service fee is too high then my policy is ZERO tip!   Crappy service - stupid credit card policy - overpriced - earns you my 1 star rating!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food. No flavor. Served cold. Only thing hot was the naan. My wife and I couldn't continue eating the food. The lady the works there flat out said that's how we serve our food, would you like us to microwave it? The food taste like frozen Indian food and they serve you nasty tap water with things floating in it. Do not go here. Go to Lazeez."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is amazing. The food is outstanding with an authentic home cooked taste (I've traveled throughout India so I have high standards!) The venue is very simple but clean, and the menu will be expanding as the restaurant grows. I had the Samosa chat which was truly outstanding - the medley of flavor was exquisite - and the Spring Dosa was out of this world - I'd say it's the best Dosa I've had in Vegas and actually, the U.S.!  The Dosa was generously filled with a delicious mixed vegetable blend and I was stuffed!  I had the Mango Kulfi for dessert since there's always room for dessert. :) Next time I'll take photos. I'll definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Very small portions, I had 4 pieces of paneer in my curry. For the price it is not worth it. The flavors were ok, but nothing to write home about. Service was prompt and we got our food out very fast (kind of shocked at how fast). If you are looking for spicy, the 10 does not even come close to spicy. Hopefully they can improve, but I'm not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken curries & biryani. We came in just before closing with 8 adults and 7 kids. Host was very accommodating. Food was South Indian, which is pretty rare in LV. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of the worst Indian we've ever been to.  They seriously don't believe in good customer service and the food qualify is piss poor.  They ran out of lamb and recommended the goat which the cook said was really good...NOT! They didn't even bother to come check on us. There was only 1 other couple at the restaurant but act as if they were too busy to even check how we like the food.  We had to chase down the server to get our check. Btw, she doesn't even know how to crack a smile.  It felt like they were so scared to come over to the table...pathetic.  Didn't even bother to let them know how terrible the food and service was.  Paid and NEVER will we go back nor would I recommend to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian restaurant in the US that I have been to in many years. Veg Biryani, Chai, Dosa, all were great. They need to expand their menu, include Idli etc."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here everything was  very delicious. We had the Chicken curry and the chicken masala. The owner was our server, she was friendly and very helpful. Next time we are in town we will be coming here."}
{"text":"I will agree with all the other reviews written at this time...the food IS delicious, definitely 5 star! However, the amount of time to get our food was extremely long. My food was received 10 minutes after my dining companion's and our appetizers were brought out separately 10 and 15 minutes after my food, which was almost 50 minutes after we originally placed our food orders. Maybe it's an Indian dining custom I'm not familiar with??  The staff was friendly, but very soft spoken. The place is clean, yet sparse on decor with only music being played in the kitchen.   We'll give them some more time to gain more operational experience and then go back for more of their excellent food."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! Entrees don't come with rice; I think we paid extra for that. Ordered the Samosa appetizer, garlic naan, chili cheese naan, and the Chicken Tikka Masala. My husband ordered the paneer curry I think, and he liked it. Service was a little slow but there was only one server, and it's still pretty new here. I would go back when I don't feel like going to an Indian buffet instead."}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful flavorful. We really enjoyed our meal here and the prices are quite reasonable. I'd suggest this place for anyone looking for more authentic Indian food. They also have gluten and dairy free options."}
{"text":"Very authentic south indian food! The dosa and medu wada were amazing. Run by a very nice family"}
{"text":"Great deal for lunch you just choose a section inland they bring you a cute little tray with a variety of Indian dishes    Perfect rise"}
{"text":"We went with our family to this place, the food is very good and authentic but the service is slow. The worst part is that the quantity of the serving is abysmally small compared to the price we paid."}
{"text":"We were bored having Indian food before we come across  This Indian hotel in Vegas .We really enjoyed the food like at home.Food is extremely delicious .Btw I forgot my cell there , the dish washer kept it safe , I have collected it back. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"I ordered some chicken curry from here through grub hub. The to-go order arrived without the rice... also no plastic utensils were provided. Eating curry with no rice and with your fingers is no fun!!!!  Grub hub tried to rectify the situation but the curry house was very unapologetic. They said rice was not necessarily included even though it says so on the menu. This place gets two stars because the curry tasted good even though i was forced to eat it like an animal."}
{"text":"I am so glad this curry house replaced the Tokyo Kitchen, which was short-lived and had been shut down for the longest time--I didn't even get the chance to try their food. But that's okay, because Indian Curry House is very delicious!  My usual Indian go-to is (or was) the Mount Everest buffet on Valley View & Sahara, but I think Indian Curry House tops that, even if it isn't buffet. My party of 5 arrived at lunch time and we were a little surprised that it was empty. We sat down in a booth that only sat 4 people but I was okay being the 5th person at the edge. They were very polite and accommodating and offered to pull up a table next to the booth, but I kindly refused.   The lunch menu is simple, offering 3 different combinations. Each comes with 2 main courses and 3 sides/desserts. If you're feeling adventurous, go with the one that comes with lamb. I generally don't like lamb because of its gaminess, but they cook it well here.  When the food came out, which took just a little longer than expected considering we were the only people there, it seemed like it wasn't enough to fill me up. Boy was I wrong! The naan bread really helped. The chicken masala was the best I ever had and the side salads worked well with the other dishes. I also tried the mango drink, but it was super sweet. It was like mango yogurt with extra sugar.  I will definitely be back to try other lunch combos and for sure will come for dinner for a regular portion of that chicken masala!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Indian food and friendly service. We had a group of seven and we all enjoyed our dinner. Highly recommend the Paneer curry. Very vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food was also Not at par. We ordered Dosas and it took them 20 mins. They forgot order once. Dosas were not cooked properly and there was no chutney with dosa.   Only thing fast was check"}
{"text":"I have no clue as to how good the food is.  I see by other reviews that it's good, but I wouldn't know.  I went there a couple of days ago, arriving just before the 5:00 PM opening time.  A man went in (I guess he's the manager), but he didn't turn on the OPEN sign or turn on any extra lights.  He puttered around with no sense of urgency to get the place open on time.  Another man went in and started mopping.  Both of these guys knew I was outside waiting to go in. I was still standing outside after the posted opening time, with no end of their puttering around in sight.  I understand that sometimes small businesses like this have late starts, but even so they need to learn that they can't let customers simply stand outside waiting for the place to finally open.  Again, I saw no sense of urgency from either of these two gentlemen to get caught up with whatever caused their late start.  Even if they weren't quite ready to start serving at the posted opening time they still could have let me in, apologized about the issue and gotten to me in a timely manner.  But this didn't happen.  So I had delicious Thai food instead.  I hope for their sake that they learn better customer service."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time the other night. I am vegetarian and they had a great selection for vegetarians. The menu Isn't huge but the quality of the food is is amazing. I eat at a lot of Indian restaurants in town in this place is unique in the sense that it tastes just like home cooking and the flavors in the food we're incredible. I have a lot of friends from India and have eaten several home cooked meal, this places cooking would rival any of those meals and had the same home cooked flavor. The Roti and garlic naan we're so yummy as well. Service was great and very welcoming. Price was reasonable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for high quality Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I had the BEST vegetable biryani here! I work in the same neighborhood and stumbled upon this gem en route to one of my favorite vegan spots, veggie house. I found so many options on their menu and Rama helped me with understanding what the substitutes were for my vegan self, she gave a lentil sauce to top it off.    it was amazing, I especially liked that they believed when I said spice level 10.   Perfectttttt!"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and fresh. Delicious food !!! Love the different variety of dosas, lunch thali and other items in their menu. Our favorite is spring dosa and chicken dosa. Recommend this place if someone is looking for a good south Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have eaten in."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered the kashmir thali off of the lunch menu. The food came out relatively quickly, fresh and hot. The servers were able to accommodate to some of the others' food preferences of wanting to replace the lamb with chicken curry in the kashmir thali, and they were agreeable and happy to do so. Overall everything tasted great, and very filling as well, a good portion for the price. Would definitely come back again when craving for Indian food!"}
{"text":"Visiting for a conference and was honestly waiting for another restaurant on mothers day with a ridiculous long wait so we decided to see what else was in the area so we decided to take a chance on this. Walking by we saw it was pretty dead but decided to give it a try. While the wait for food was a little bit we ordered the samosa chat, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. Our meal was amazing! Everything had so much flavor that we ate our entire meal. If I lived in Vegas this would definitely be our go to spot. Hoping we can stop by again before we leave!! Thank you for being so nice to my husband, myself and our 9 month son!!    UPDATE-we went again last night and my husband tried a different thing and everything was so good if not better than the other day. Wish I had a place like this in Dallas! It's so good!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome, Dosa and briyani are very nice. Have visited multiple Indian restaurants here but this one gives the exact south indian taste. I like sambar and chutney very much in this Indian curry. Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I had kashmir thali and chicken biryani here.. thali was ok. As it misses north indian flavors in north indian thali. Chicken biryani is gross, lacks flovour, rice looks red blood color.. it looks gross.  Above all, their service is damn slow. When we visited, it wasnt crowded, only one person is managing checks and serving. We almost waited for 20 mins for pre prepared thali.. pls hire a good cook and few waiters to continue in business"}
{"text":"Came here for a colleagues birthday lunch and it was wonderful! This is a more traditional Indian restaurant, so many items are served with Naan rather than rice (but you can still ask for rice instead). The place is very clean, and the staff are attentive and polite.  I had the chicken Tikka Masala with naan, and I have never had better in all of Las Vegas. There was a minimal amount of chicken in the dish, with the majority of the bowl being sauce; however, remember that in many cases traditional Indian cuisine is made up of sauces, grains, and vegetables, with a minimal amount of meats.  Colleagues had: Vegetable Biryani Thali Kashmir Thali Kal Dosa  Everything was delicious, and we were not rushed. I will definitely be back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"As a person from Hyderabad I can totally vouch for the spice level and biriyani and vada pav here my friends tried the Chennai thali meal which was made perfect with a great aroma and decor on the food."}
