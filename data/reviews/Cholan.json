{"text":"Everything was excellent about this place. The best authentic south Indian restaurant by margin in GTA. We went to weekend buffet for 15$ and it was awesome. Must try place, if you love spicy south Indian food.

On weekend buffet please make sure you go at noon, if you go  around 2 pm or so, then its not worth it. Food will be cold, half of the items are empty and on and on.."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my parents after my birthday and I must say, driving all the way from Richmond Hill is definitely worth it. We've heard of the place before, but never had the time nor occasion to do so. 

We went inside and the ambiance was casual and homely. We were greeted by the server, who's actually the owners' daughter I believe, since its a family run restaurant. 

The menu selections were appetizing and were just the right amount. Not too less, not too much. The sambhar was very tasty and delicious and had the right kick to it. The best was the curd rice. 

The owner would keep on coming to ensure we were doing fine. 

Overall the ambiance, staff and food were great."}
{"text":"Since moving to Toronto I have been on a mission to find a decent South Indian restaurant, after much searching I popped into Cholan for lunch one weekend. They had a fantastic spread of South Indian dishes that one would probably only find in India- poondu kozumbu, kootu, Kotthu roti etc and of course the usual idlli, dosa, sambar and chutney. I was pleasantly surprised firstly by the warm service from the manager of the place and the fantastic food. The idllis were small, resonably soft with little or no soda in them, so no bloating. Dosas- fantastic, perfect size, right amount of crispyness and not sour at all indicating that the dough wasn't old and was probably ground the night before. Vadas- crisp, small and fresh. All the curries were authentic, they even had a wonderful selection of 'Indian Chinese'! Definitely a place worth trying. Good job Cholan!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant a few weeks ago for the lunch buffet (9.99$). The location is in a plaza with a bunch of other stores and the inside of the location is small but enough to sustain a good amount of people. The food was alright (I have had better Indian food at restaurants) and the dosa was good. The actual dosa was well made and crispy (just the way I like it) but the potato baji inside the dosa didn't taste great at all -  I would simply stick to a plain dosa. 

The service was good and the people were friendly. Overall, I would recommend this location to a friend who wants a good amount of food for a good price."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I get their masala dosa for take out at least once a week for $7.80 tax included."}
