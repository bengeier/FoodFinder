{"text":"My favorite bean and cheese burritos E.V.E.R !!
They are heavy on the cheese that came straight from heaven and their tortillas taste as if they are hand made everyday. They include a spicy red salsa that is to. die. for. Normally I have to drench my food in salsa for it to be satisfactory but this little container of salsa does the trick and leaves me breathless. Literally.
A must if you happen to be in the west side of Phoenix."}
