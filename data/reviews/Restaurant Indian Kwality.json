{"text":"Found out last night that they overcharged $1 for each dish, $3 for a small Indian dessert that we didn't order! The guy who seemed like an owner said \"I made this for you\" with nice smile, so thought it was on the house! Is this real?! Food was good, didn't mind their slow service (it's small family run resto), but this is unacceptable. Felt something's weird when heard the total price (had to go pay at the cashier because he never came out of the kitchen). Seriously.. Glad that we asked for the bill & the menu (he was slightly hesitant) even after payment to figure this out (at home). The menu says any order includes naan or rice, but we paid for them. Feeling aweful about having given good tip when he asked \"how much tips (would you like to add on the bill)?\" This can't happen.
Also, anyone wants to pay $1.50 + tax ($3 for two on a plate) for one gulab jamun? or was it another type of rip-off? Guess that's why all the tables were empty except two including ours."}

We came on a Sunday afternoon, around 3:00pm so we weren't surprised that there was nobody else there. We are regulars at another Indian restaurant nearby so I was initially a little hesitant to go try another restaurant. I walked in, wanting to look at the menu and the lady working there just told me to sit down and that she'd bring me a menu. Right off the bat, I found her to be a little too pushy.

We weren't so hungry so we knew we wanted to share a Thali. We asked what the difference between a veggie thali and the super veggie thali and she said the different was just that you get to choose the dishes in the super on and in the regular one, they are pre-selected. For 3$ extra, we decided we were fine with the surprise. This displeased the woman who said \"one thali is not enough for two people\". I explained that we were just looking for a quick snack but shouldn't have had to even do this.

When the food arrived (very quickly), we enjoyed our meal. The chickpea masala was our favourite and the naan was fresh and delicious. I don't think that everything was fresh because the food came ridiculously fast but I think they probably made it that morning and just rewarmed it. 

I got the feeling that we were being judged for not ordering enough. The samosas were 2/3$ to eat there so we decided to just get 2 to go (2/1$) because we weren't so hungry and wanted to eat them after. She seemed to be upset by this.

Overall, we found the food to be delicious but the service lacking. For 12$ tax and tip in, it makes for a yummy and cheap meal.

Food: 5/5 (We didn't like one of the dishes but the fresh naan made up for it)
Value:5/5
Service:1/5
Atmosphere:2/5"}
