{"text":"Great environment and food! First Japanese ramen restaurant of its kind in montreal. Takes you to Japan without the traveling. Price is not cheap, but worth the experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them zero stars. This has to be by far the most bizarre dining experience I have ever had, which wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing if their food actually tasted any good. Out of all of the ramen places I've tried, of which there have been many, this has to be the worst bowl of noodles I've ever had (even if I include the noodle shop that had the audacity to serve me what basically amounted to instant noodles). The slices of pork were basically slices of lard. There was no meat--just fat. The noodles were bland--likely dehydrated noodles that were rehydrated. The broth was not noteworthy...it was just this salty--thing-- with not much flavour that the bland noodles just sat in--and the service! OMG! You all have your own little stall and a button to get the waiting staff's attention. Sounds efficient, right?! It would be if their waiters were able to read the situation and pick up social cues well. Do you know how many times they dropped the curtain in my face before I was done talking to them? 3 times! In the span of about ten minutes! All I wanted was a cup for water, which apparently there's a tap for at your stall. I felt like a horse at a trough. I am never eating there again."}
{"text":"The most disgusting ramen I've had so far:
Cons:
1. The cha-shu is very, very salty, should be named as salt-shu.
2. The soup of ramen is not delicious at all. I doubt the soupe is made by some fast-brewed powder (like the brewed coffee)
3. All the things are too expensive regarding to the food and service provided. No need to compare with the real ramen restaurant in Japan, comparing with the local No. 1  ramen Yokato on Yelp(not a AD, you could compare by yourselves, let your tongue tell the truth), the price of Kumamoto is 50% more expensive however the taste is very very disappointing.

Pros:
The only thing that I could find for this section is the location...

Conclusion:
The owner of Kumamoto Ramen needs to be re-educated on how to manage a qualified restaurant(not a \"good\" one)"}
{"text":"Same as ramen I ate in Japan.very good ramen in Montreal.and the fried chicken tasted better than Korean fried chicken"}
{"text":"I loved everything, wish only my ramen was spicier 
The place is cozy and the staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Ramen is so fresh! Really cool eating atmosphere! Definitely try the tonkotsu!"}
{"text":"The Food
My mother and I ordered  the veggie ramen, the original Tonkotsu ramen and the Takoyaki. 13$ for one bowl with barely anything inside except for noodles and 2 small slices of meat. More fat than meat. If you want more toppings, you have to add them in. 1,99 for one marinated egg and 2 or 3$ (I can't remember) for \"black mushrooms. The noddles were like the instant noodles you get from the supermarket. And the Takoyaki wasn't cooked properly because the batter was chewy. In the end our bill was 50$. Not worth it.

The Service
We waited an hour in line to be seated which is understandable because there were limited seats but after we were seated and ordered, we waited around half an hour for our food to come when people who had just came in got their food before us! 

I don't think I'll be coming to this place again and I don't recommend it but maybe others might get a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"Recommend the black garlic broth, really good and packed with flavor. Egg was delicious and the pork was nice. Tried both noodles, fun place for a date or alone. Just a fun meal. I tried the veggie broth my girlfriend had  and it tasted a lot of corn but otherwise the black garlic was amazing. Waiter noticed that we were waiting a bit and made sure we got our meal so the service was nice."}
{"text":"Take a chance to try this new restaurant and feeling satisfied. From the staff to the food was so on  point , also the restaurant decoration was authentic japanese ramen resto decor so unique."}
{"text":"It was delicious, especially the karaage! I loved the self-service and wished it was in Vancouver!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! Enjoyed the karage a lot and the ramen was very hot and tasty. :)"}
{"text":"Avoid the horrible service and lacklustre food here, folks. The portions are sub standard. There's no special flavor at all. The wait time to put an order in is long. They don't tell you how to pay and you'd be trapped at your table forever if you don't scream out to get the attention of their super spaced out staff!"}
{"text":"Can't deny that the overall design of the restaurant is unique, BUT the food is overpriced ! They charge around 8% more compare to average Japanese ramen price and the taste was NOT special in any ways somehow. Chashu Don is just a small bowl of steamed rice with 3 slices of pork...??? Paying 15$ for a ramen that can't even make you full/enjoy is definitely not worth it, don't even mention rice."}
{"text":"The service is very interesting, similar to japanese noodle houses where social contact is minimal. With a little cultural adaptation, it's a nice experience to have in Montreal.
Food is delicious, not the biggest portion though."}
{"text":"The decor and ambience of the restaurant is great. The have a good selection of delicious ramen. But compared to other ramen restaurants, the price here is steep given both the quality and quantity of food. Additional toppings can be requested for your bowl of ramen, but on top of the high base price of a bowl, it adds up to a lot. Many such toppings come standard at other ramen restaurants. The staff is polite, but not altogether enthusiastic or professional."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a girl's night- and we were CRAVING ramen. She mentioned it's a new place that opened up corner St.Mathieu/St. Catherine. Location is not hard to find, if you look to the right of the star of L'Inde. 

DECOR: loved it! So new and hip- group of 4 or less people are seated along 2 strips of \"booths\"-almost like library stalls with a hallway between these two strips. You get placed at a booth that is numbered. There is a personal water fountain/dispenser on your left- which gets a bit messy because you are always spilling water on the table. Then there is a button on the right that you press when you are ready to order food or have questions (almost like a flight attendant button? but for food!) and the server will up and pull this curtain up to serve you -felt like i was playing kitchen in grade school!

MENU: Super simple. You're given a menu: sides-include fried octopus balls, edamame, fried chicken etc. (min 7$); ramen- spicy/black garlic/bbq/classic pork and veggie- not much option for people that want variety (min 14$) and you pay for extra toppings (3$-6$ rediculous -a 3$ egg- and 3$ for 4 strips of nouri-get real people!!); there is a non-alcoholic drink menu and dessert menu as well.Once you have decided your choices you check it off on a paper menu, press the button and give your order in.

MY MEAL:I had the black garlic pork ramen with extra nouri and an egg. I paid 27$ with tip (for weird service-keep reading) for ONE RAMEN DISH- NOT WORTH IT! I have been to kinton ramen and other competitors that offer toppings for 1$ a piece but lets be really if they want to get pricey with their menu- add more choice of food. The ramen was good though- a large serving with good seasoned pork that melted away with the egg; the noodles were a bit undercooked- and traditional Japanese spoons ( I found hard to eat with- maybe because I am left handed?? no idea)

SERVICE: weird. I feel there this a trend at a lot of  restaurants I have been going to in the Concordia region hire students that LACK customer service skills. For example- I paid by debit and the first time the transaction didn't work- the girl hands me back the machine and says it's my card. I laugh and respond I think it's the wifi reception- second time? no problems- BUT DONT BLAME your customers. #2 They give out cards to collect points for the 11th ramen free. Knowing I wouldn't be coming back here-  I asked her if I could give my stamp to my friend-cashier says no- its one stamp per person per purchase?? again- makes no sense- why the big deal?  like seinfeld- no ramen for you!

Like any new venue- this place needs some work, I am curious to read the reviews in a couple of months. But for now, if you are really craving ramen and are on a budget-do your research and don't splurge here."}
{"text":"The food was so good and I was given a vegetarian option which is very important for me ."}
{"text":"This was my second time having ramen in Montreal (I'm quite skeptical when it comes to ramen) and I really enjoyed this one! 

Apart from the fact that the broth wasn't salted enough, I liked the taste of it and the noodles as well. I got the vege ramen btw! 

I also really love the setting of this place since you get a lot of privacy. The seats are similar to counter seats except there's a curtain in front of you which only opens when you order your food. I went with another friend so they opened up the separation barrier between our seats so we could talk!"}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing setting and super staff!!! I came with my 7year old and he had a blast with the decor! We took the chaschu lover meal it was delllllivious"}
{"text":"The decor and system of this place rocks. Every table and seat comes with a button that you press when you're ready to order. They have seats at the bar where you can even get served in front of you. The bar seats can be adjusted so you can see your neighbours if you're in a group. 
The only problem is that the latch to remove the separators protrudes and I kept hitting my elbow on it. 

The ramen is gooood. Their broth is great, noodles standard, and meat not too fatty. I got the original so it was a really basic bowl but still good. Wish they had a fried chicken bowl. 

It's just a bit expensive and everything added is an extra. Worth it for a fancy ramen night out though."}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my evening at Kumamoto they just opened and were doing a soft launch. The decor and setup is really special and like nothing I've seen in Montreal. 
There are individual stalls that you can open or close if you're a group. You press a button when you're ready to order and they open a curtain to serve you as the kitchen is in the centre of the restaurant! You also have individual tap water faucets at every table. 
It's  ramen place so I ordered the spicy pork ramen with a side of friend chicken.
The fried chicken was well prepared crispy on outside and large juicy price of chicken on the inside !
The ramen was nice too, not the best noodles I've tried but it was a great quality thick broth with right level of spice, plenty of vegetables and of course some nice pieces of pork.
I've tried pretty much every ramen place in Montreal and can say this one has great potential!"}
{"text":"I can say good for new restaurants! I hope they can keep this quality of food.

I would like to give 5 star. But I give 4 star because of the time that we was in waiting for more then 60 mins. they have error of our order. 

The foods are good! I Recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good ramen here! I ordered the tonkatsu black and my boyfriend got the chashu lover. We also ordered the takoyaki and takowasa as well, which were both really good. I'm not really sure why some reviews on here say it's not good, but I really enjoyed the food here.

Favorite thing about this place is the booths! Reminds me of ichiran ramen, and I would totally eat at kumamoto all the time just to be able to eat in solitude."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars because I like the place. Japan feels. :)
Nice servers too. Food was just so-so."}
{"text":"Having been in japan this is probably the most authentic ramen place i have ever been to!the setting is unique in that every stall is individual and you have these cool ordering buttons so you're never waiting for a server! I ordered the kumamoto ramen and would do it anyday again! 

I highly recommend trying this place although it is a little more expensive than usual ramen places (13.99 and up for a ramen)

I recommend the original kumamoto ramen but take the spicy!"}
{"text":"Excellent tonkatsu ramen in downtown Montreal. The original soup was rich and savory. Wavy noodles were perfect. Chashu (2 slices of pork) was savory and delicious. Eggs (2 halves, non-marinated) were soft and runny.

Don't be intimidated by the queue. It's actually the line to pay, not the line to be seated.

Kumamoto (??) offers private (single) seating with dividers and curtains, similar to Ichiran (??). 

The original tonkatsu ramen costed $11.99 after $2 discount (original price $13.99), while tonkatsu black costed $13.99 after $2 discount (original price $15.99). It would be really expensive without the discount."}
{"text":"its fair. Authentic Japanese tonkustu pork ramen. If you never been japan. Try it may surprise u"}
{"text":"Great ramen ! Had the tantanmen and karaage and everything was fresh ! Possibly the best in Montreal"}
{"text":"Nice concept, not so great food. This place inspires itself from ramen places in Japan where you can sit alone in your own booth and have minimal interaction with others. You sit down in your own booth, fill your order on a sheet of paper, then you ring the bell. Someone will then come to pick up your order through the curtain in front of you. 

The decor of the restaurant is nice. As mentioned earlier, this concept is also unique. That being said, their food did not impress me at all. At the price of 13$ for a bowl of ramen, it goes more on the expensive side. Such with nice decor, I was expecting a good bowl of ramen reminiscing me of my good days of Japan. Sadly, I was greatly underwhelmed. The quantity was very little for the price. There were 2 thin slices of pork, a few noodles, and some bean sprouts. The flavors were very bland also. At the beginning, it felt very flavorful but it got salty very quickly. By the end of the bowl, I was left unsatisfied.

Overall, I would not recommend this place to someone else since the food was not great at all. Unless they change their chef or the way they make their food, then I might give it a try. 

PS. They were running a promotion where if you give more than 4 stars on Google Reviews or Yelp, so beware of their inflated reviews on Google!"}
{"text":"Sick and tired of the glut of ramen places that have noodled their way all over the city in the last three years?

You don't have to be anymore! Go to Kumamoto and enjoy its authentic weirdness. And its tasty ramen. Sit by yourself in a private stall, complete with its own bamboo curtain and water fountain. Press a button when you're ready to order and wait for the server to shuffle over to you and speak neither English or French. Take a mind vacation. You could be anywhere. Tokyo. Vancouver. Brazil. And make sure to check out the secret second menu on the chopstick holders.

I ordered the spicy broth and enjoyed the ramen more than Ichifuku across the street. I'd say it's better than many of the weak reviews it's receiving here on Yelp and definitely worth a visit..."}
{"text":"Taste under average, so overpriced. The ramen soup is warm-cold. We spent $75 include taxes and tips for two ramen and two snacks. But I like the decorations and the cute ramen bowl."}
{"text":"Identical to Ichiran ramen (taste still different). Pretty nice concept and decor. Ramen is good, a little pricey nonetheless. I would def recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because the ambiance/setup was so lovely and exciting. However, the ramen was very underwhelming and it was quite pricy. I ordered the original pork ramen and it really lacked flavour. The broth tasted so watered down. The karaage and takoyaki on the other hand, was really good at least. Overall, I wouldn't go back. There are tons of tastier ramen joints in Montreal for better pricing."}
{"text":"If you cone here alone, you can experience quite a unique experience originated from japan. 
The service was excellent. I really love the ordering system. you can call a waitress only when you want by pressing the button in the table. They never bother you unless you want to. 

I ordered tantan men and it turned out quite a surprise. Good balance of fat and savoury in the broth which many other ramen restaurants in Montreal can't do so well. 

One star is missing because of the cost and the portion. 
The price for the bowl of ramen is around $14-17.
But portion was not at all North american size whatsoever."}
{"text":"It's a really tasty ramen place, i loved the experience. It felt private, we had the original tonkotsu ramen combo and red tonkotsu ramen combo. The original tonkotsu ramen was salty. The meat was so well made that it was falling apart when picked up. I also liked that we got three pork pieces and a whole egg for each ramen dish. As well, we got the wavy noodles which was perfect. The red tonkotsu ramen is mildly spicy. We really liked the experience, we're looking forward to going back again. I think we'll both be getting red tonkotsu ramen combo. :)"}
{"text":"Delicieux! Les cubicules donnent une ambiance cozy. La soupe etait legere mais gouteuse. La serveuse etait presente et le kaarage juste à point. Parfait pour le lunch ou un petit creux!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and interesting place. I liked how they're business works. I ordered black ramen and it was good (not the best) but overpriced for that portion size. There was just only one small piece of \"chashu\" ."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely adorable, love the ambiance, decoration and everything.

At first I was also really happy that the menu had quite a short list of items, it usually means that the restaurant masters these few meals... but I was so wrong.

I ordered the vegetarian ramen. It was so tasteless. Just like water with boiled vegetables in it, and some noodles. Nothing else, no spice no flavor, no seasoning. It was so boring. 

In addition the service is quite poor. I wanted to add some soy sauce to have at least a bit of flavor, the waitress answered, it's only for the cooks we don't give it to customers. So I ended up not eating my meal at all.

Anyway, don't waste your money in this overpriced restaurant. Definitively better to cook your own ramen at home"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a Saturday evening, where we were seated pretty quickly in a booth for 2. 

The service was very quick as there is a button to call a waiter/waitress to your booth, and you get your own water dispenser. I ended up trying their Black Tonkotsu Ramen which is a pork broth with black garlic oil while my bf decided to try their Chicken ramen which is a light chicken broth. For our sides, we decided to try their chicken karaage and takoyaki. 

After trying many other ramen places, as much as this place gave a new experience in eating ramen in a booth, their ramens were simply okay, with the broths being not as flavourful but quite light. The black tonkotsu ramen had a little more flavour due to the garlic oil, but it was still not impressing. However, their karaage was pretty good, being crispy on the outside and still juicy in the inside. Their takoyaki was also good however I wish they put a little more sauce. 

Overall, the experience of this restaurant and it's quick service makes it worthwhile to try, however their food is a little underwhelming. If you're looking for a place simply for ramen, I would recommend other places."}
{"text":"The decoration and bowl are very cute. I recommend the original and black ramen with an egg."}
{"text":"This ramen joint reminds me of Ichiran ramen booths in Asia. The service is quick and straight to the point. There are many different types of ramens to choose from, my favourite is the red tonkatsu ramen :)"}
{"text":"$25 for a bowl of soup, with 2 small slices of pork BBQ, definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"First of all the decor of this restaurant is incredibly cute and very reminiscent of a real Japanese ramen joint. The restaurant tries its best to recreate an authentic Japanese experience with its decor and ramen options.

This is where the similarities end though, the restaurant fails to recreate the authentic experience because most of their ramen options are overpriced and flavourless. I ordered the vegetable ramen and it was as if somebody threw some boiled vegetables and noodles into hot water and called it ramen. In addition, it's way too expensive for the tiny portion of whatever they're serving. On top of everything, the staff is quite rude from the very small interactions they'll have with you. 

The only redeeming quality of this place is their decor because everything else fails to hit the mark."}
{"text":"Cute resto Ramen proche du métro Concordia. Le décor et le concept le distingue des autres restos Ramen du coin. 

T'as le choix de prendre une \"table standard\" ou \"un booth\". Nous avons choisi le booth: Il y a un paravent en bois qui sépare les clients et un rideau pour servir les plats. Lorsqu'on est prêt à commander, on appuie sur le bouton de service, le serveur prend la commande et sert les plats en levant le rideau. C'était fun comme expérience! 
Le Ramen de mon amie et mon bol de riz ont été bons, les portions étaient par contre un peu petit pour le prix."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. 

I just had lunch with my boyfriend. The food was good, I am not gonna lie about that. I finished the whole bowl. Nothing left in it. 
BUT since there is no food description of ingredients on the menu it's hard to know what is in each plate. Out of curiosity, I asked more question once at the cash. I found out that I was served a ramen that was missing items AND that my soup already came with some items I've asked extra. I was also charged 5$ for 5 little pieces of bamboo. Inexplicable. THE WORST AND MORE DISTURBING THING is that while I went back to get my coat and told my bf what just happened... the same lady that made me realize ingredients were missing came back with my bowl and tried to convince me that it was served by showing me a piece of it left in my finished bowl. REALLY?  There was nothing left in it. And, furthermore, I know what I eat when I eat it. This is the most insulting thing ever. 

Even if the food is good, prices are off (Try Ichifuku instead! Right across the street) and that kind of behaviour is unacceptable. 
I will never be going back.
G."}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere. You wouldn't feel lonely eating alone because they have cute isolated bar tables. Good service. Worst ramen I've ever had in Montréal downtown."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!!! Love everything about! The decorations are beautiful! and it's the type of restaurant where you can eat alone since it's possible to separate the booths. The menu is kind of small and I just wish there was more description to each food. The prices are decent, ramen, depending on what type you get, is about 12-15$, and if you want to add more toppings it's an additional 2-5$. Very simple to order, they give you a paper and you write down the number of the dish you want, press the button when you're done and then the staff will pick it up. The staff btw are very friendly as well. Their ramen is very delicious, I find that it has a lot of flavour compared to other ramen places i've been to. Will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Le restaurant vient tout juste d'ouvrir. J'ai aimé le fait qu'ils essaient de nous faire vivre une expérience plus unique, quelque chose de très japonais. J'ai commandé une soupe au porc épicé. Le bouillon était goûteux et crémeux, vraiment bon. Le porc était tout aussi délicieux, dommage que les morceaux était si petits. Je l'ai trouvé plus tendre et moins gras que dans beaucoup de soupes ramen mangés dans d'autres resto du genre. 

Les négatifs: les extras étaient chers, pas assez de choix, les soupes sont 14$ et viennent avec juste les nouilles et le porc. Tout le reste est en extra. 2$ pour un oeuf. Aucun service à la clientèle, tu te coules ton verre d'eau toi-même et tu es assis face à un rideau de bamboo fermé. Les gyokas sur le menu ne sont pas disponibles. Le staff ne parle pas français et très peu anglais."}
{"text":"Non, ils n'ont pas déclassé mes ramens préférés. Cependant, j'ai eu zéro turn-off qui justifierait d'accorder moins de cinq étoiles. Je suis sortie ravie! 

*
Pour les avis qui mentionnent que le bouillon est parfois peu goûteux, ce serait à valider selon les choix, puisque j'ai personnellement opté pour le \"Tantanmen\", qui est fait avec une pâte de piments donc un peu \"hot\"! C'était savoureux.

*
L'accueil des hôtesses était vraiment amical, plus low-key et calme que dans certains Izakaya. On nous a bien expliqué comment placer notre commande et signaler à la cuisine à l'aide d'un bouton, qui n'est rien de moins que la bédaine de la mascotte, awwn! Puis, on nous a laissés tranquilles, ce qui est vraiment la bénédiction dans ce concept: on appelle quand on a besoin de service, donc on ne se fait jamais interrompre le reste du repas. 

*
Le luxe d'avoir son propre robinet d'eau pour remplir son verre? Oh que c'est un truc niaiseux mais qui va me manquer dorénavant ailleurs :D

*
Le karaage en était un très solide. Ne passez pas à côté de cet ajout à votre repas!"}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian ramen. The noodles were ok and the toppings fresh, but as far  as ramen goes, the proof is in the broth. And that broth was screaming for flavor, or at least a good dash of soy or hot sauce.
Alas - they were not available and the dining experience was bland and joyless.

The portion was also rather small for the price. Luckily ramen restos are ubiquitous in the area, so just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Large amount of food, nice environment and also nice service. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"The ramen is a bit greasy for my taste. But overall pretty good! The mocha jelly desert is very good!"}
