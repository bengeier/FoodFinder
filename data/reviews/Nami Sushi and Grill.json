{"text":"I just love this place , I love the staff , I love the food , I love just everything . 
We are always treated with such kindness when we come in . I don't know what else to wright it's just simply my favourite place for sushi ."}
{"text":"Decent sushi place on the edge of the Beltline. Lots of options on the menu, including quite a bit of vegetarian food (but please note that this doesn't include the miso soup, sadly). Ample portions, fairly fresh fish - you know, fresh for Calgary :) I did find the presentation a bit lacking for my rolls, but I had no complaints with the taste or the price. 

It looks like it could be a very lively place, (although it was fairly quiet that night). They have a patio right on 14th St for people watching, which I hope to try next visit. The TV was playing Euro Cup soccer when we were there, but I don't know what else they show. 

Staff were quite pleasant and super helpful, answering all of our questions with ease. A nice touch - they overheard it was my partner's birthday, so at the end of the meal they brought him a slice of cheesecake & sang Happy Birthday to him. It was delicious and worth returning for :)

3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Highly recommended! My wife and I eat here regularly. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. Great service in the restaurant and take out and delivery is fast! An excellent choice for sushi in Calgary!"}
{"text":"The sushi was reasonably priced, with good portions and a better than average selection of vegetarian items. The downside was really the inaccuracy of the menu, and the service. While greeted promptly, once the dishes has been cleared it took almost twenty minutes for our server to return to our area. We ordered dessert from the menu, and when it came, was not what we had ordered, but a more expensive option. We asked our server and were told we ordered wrong, she brought the menu so we could point out  what we had ordered, when she told us they didn't have those options anymore. So, with our expensive ice cream melting (presumably, from its shape, not for the first time...) we were told we had our only option. 

After dessert, we were never served again. No one came to tidy our dishes, and we had to go up to the service window to request our bills. 

I really wanted to love this place...
But I'm not sure I'll venture back."}
{"text":"Long story short, they don't treat you with respect 30 mins before close. I understand how dumb of us to arrive late because of work and traffic and we only wanted take-out but nonetheless we will NOT return."}
{"text":"First time going here, and I must say, the best service I have ever received! I was getting take out and they told me to take my time, to take a seat and brought me warm tea. The staff was friendly and kind and the food was extremely delicious. I had the Las Vegas roll and would recommend to everyone if you like a warmer sushi. My new go to Sushi place!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Nami in quite awhile. In fact not since 2003!
Before that Nami was our go to Sushi spot during the halcyon days of the 1980's, how may downtown restaurants have that kind of pedigree?
In fact, how many Mercado's & Karson Bar's will be here in 5 years let alone 30?
 It's still a high quality Japanese restaurant experience with all the requisite touchstones: excellent food with a large variety of choices.The apps were all very tasty(salads, grilled tofu, sushi pizza & tempura) the robata choices were all very fresh and delicious, we had grilled mackerel, an assortment of mushrooms & asparagus - all expertly grilled & presented with elegant simplicity. The maki rolls & sashimi were also beautiful prepared with the correct ratios of rice & fillings, not too big of small. All in all: Excellent value. Our meal, an immense amount of food for 4 large appetites along with 2 rounds of drinks came to just under $500. Our waiter was attentive, helpful & friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Located on 14 St SW near 17 Ave, Nami Sushi offers good quality sushi for relatively reasonable prices.

AMBIENCE/SERVICE: Entering this average sized Sushi restaurant we were immediately greeted by cheerful \"irashaimase\" from servers and chefs alike; always a good sign. We were seated immediately and informed that we would still be able to get the lunch specials even though we had missed the displayed cutoff time. Our server was friendly and attentive, but could have done a better job keeping our glasses filled with water, especially after a single fill-up early into our meal. 2/2.5

FOOD: I ordered Lunch Box C ($11.50), which came with 2 tuna and 2 salmon sashimi, 3 assorted nigiri sushi, a small green salad with vinaigrette dressing, and choice of chicken/beef/tofu teriyaki over rice. It was all presented in a nice bento box and served with a bowl of piping hot miso. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, the sashimi was quite fresh but a bit on the chewy side, and the nigiri didn't fall apart and was at a nice temperature. I thought it was excellent value for $11.50, but I found the prices on the regular menu more closely resembled that of an average a la carte sushi restaurant ($1.65 salmon nigiri, $10 special rolls). Stick to the specials and combos and you won't complain! 2/2.5"}
{"text":"Having been a regular since this place opened back in December 2014, it would be difficult to give it less than 5 stars. We keep coming back again and again given the consistent Vancouver-like quality, affordable prices, and friendly service. Nami is by far our favourite go-to spot for our regular fix of takeout sushi. Their menu is nothing fancy, a few creations of their own, but for the most part I would define it as simple, down-to-earth basic sushi in abundance. The atmosphere of the restaurant is reflective of that philosophy as well.

Having tried numerous sushi spots all over Calgary, I can confidently say that Nami is one of the top sushi places in town in terms of quality and affordability, and by far the best bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a good price. Good vegetarian choices. Lunch options are particularly reasonably priced. Super nice staff too"}
{"text":"We were here last night with our family, to our surprise. The food were really good at a very reasonable price. The attentive waitress recommended the Nami roll, $10.95 and Calgary Flames roll. It was the best roll we had. There were thin layers of rice and filled full of fish. The diner bentos was also a great portion with big slices of sashimi.  I will definitely come back again and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Decor needs an upgrade as it is not appealing at all. 

But great food and great value. customer service is attentive ( sometimes a bit too much)."}
{"text":"Nice quality sashimi, tasty feature rolls with cheap price .10 percent off for take away. Great deal."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi, good prices, generous portions, friendly service. Parking is an issue but well worth it"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot. Lots of selection. Teriyaki hot plates are amazing. Even lots of stuff for that weirdo in your group that doesn't like fishies."}
{"text":"Ordered from Just Eat. The fish did not seem fresh. Cheap quality. The rice was not all the way cooked through. The tempura shrimp was cold by the time the meal arrived. The portions were small. Definitely not worth $27 + tip."}
{"text":"The high score this place receives is a testament to Calgarians poor knowledge of quality sushi."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't write a review right after my first visit, because this place is great! 
First of all the people who work there really care about their customers, they are extremely nice people! I remember our first visit, they had just opened and they directly asked for feedback, such a smart thing to do but it rarely happens.
Second, the food. Super fresh, the rolls are so low on rice and you get a lot of fish/filling. They often put some fried tempura inside the roll, in the spicy tuna for example. I personally would prefer it without it but I understand that a lot of people like these small crunchy pieces. It's just something celiac people need to know about.
Prices are really good especially regarding the quality you get. So there is a reason why this place is quite busy in the evenings and especially on the weekend. It's worth the wait, in case you have to. A lot of people also get take out, I think you get 10% off take out. I'd say this is my second favorite sushi place in Calgary. Red Ember is still better."}
{"text":"So far one of the best sushi restaurant I've ever been.
Very polite and helpful staff.
Sashimi bowl was one of the best! Nice thick cuts and fresh good quality fish!!
Also the \"monkey brain\" was awesome. 
\"Calgary flames\" and \"green dragon\" were both very good rolls as well.
I'll definitely come back here and I wish they had a restaurant in Edmonton too! :("}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the night before my birthday last week to try them out for the first time as I worked on my birthday. Called the order in at 2 PM and was told \"It will be ready in 15 minutes\". I said \"I don't need the food until 3 PM\". Lots of time, right? Well, I arrived at 3:05 and still waited until 3:30 for the food. They gave me tea while I waited, though. I ordered an assorted sushi dinner, and added on a few pairs of my favourite pieces because, well, it was my birthday! There were a couple of pieces that were not good in the combo, very tough and difficult to bite through. I may be getting as old as a crypt keeper, but I still have all my own teeth, dammit! All of the favourite items I ordered were good, though. It was generally good sushi, but I was not impressed by the value and price of the combo for what was in it. I also would not have parked in the 20 minute loading zone to pick it up had I known it would take so long, and there is NO PARKING nearby at that time of day. I will definitely return, but would just order the custom pieces I like and skip the \"filler\" items included in a combo. I still painstakingly wrapped the individual left over pieces and had sushi for breakfast the next morning. Nobody can judge leftover sushi birthday breakfast. Nobody!"}
{"text":"We're from Vancouver and we have the best sushi there so I wasn't expecting much when we ate here. But we're actually pretty impressed how good the sushi here are. My favourite is the Calgary Flames roll.... sooo good. I also liked the croquettes and soft shell crab. Service was excellent, the lady serving us is really friendly and has a lot of urgency!!!!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the great service. They are always kind and thoughtful. They have a great selection of dishes and ways to make a combo - awesome. They have free wifi!  Their prices are good. I will for certain will be returning and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city. The quality and portions are amazing value for the price. Fish is always fresh and the service has been wonderful every time I have gone in. I really love the spicy salmon sashimi and the bento boxes... it's a really great way to try a few items at once."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Calgary! Prices and quality are comparable to what I've gotten used to living in Toronto. Rolls are actually a normal size (not ginormous with a ton of rice). Great place for take out or delivery!"}
{"text":"Delicious. 

The service was nice, the rolls were fresh and the price was brilliant. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Best sushi I have found in calgary and the only place that makes a proper green dragon. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, the staff is super friendly and attentive, plus they have a quaint patio to enjoy your delicious sushi in the sunshine. And their prices are far more reasonable than any other sushi place on this level of quality.  Highly recommend giving Nami a try:)"}
{"text":"Have only ordered thru doordash and delivery is quick and prices are reasonable.  They give you a generous amount of ginger and wasabi which is nice."}
{"text":"Having driven passed Nami more times than I can count, we finally made it in for dinner. Really sad this was the first we came in as it was really delicious. Service was fast and prompt. Presentation was just as expected when it comes to sushi.

We ordered 4 piece prawn tempura - thin light batter, very crispy, not dripping in oil. Just writing about it makes me want to head there for lunch. 

Dragon Balls were also on the menu - 5 round balls of rice deep fried with salmon. Kind of like small arancini balls but with Japanese sauces. A big ball of Yum!

For sushi rolls we tried the Alberta Roll comes with beef teriyaki, asparagus tempura inside, with avocado, deep fried onion & teriyaki sauce on top. Surprisingly flavourful and nothing overpowered any of the subtle flavours in the roll. Beef was soft and tender.

The Flames Roll was a delightful surprise of deliciousness! Spicy salmon inside, with avocado, torched salmon, benito & unagi sauce on top. It was so good. The salmon on top was lightly torched which brought out the most divine flavours. This one was the clear winner.

For once we ordered less than we normally do. I always want to eat everything but this was a good amount for a light dinner. Will absolutely be back to try everything else. Will try and order other items we didn't try, but honestly it will be really difficault to not order the Flames Roll every time.

*tip: get 10% off on take-away. They seem to do a good business on the take-away side too as lots of people came in to collect food while we had dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi on a whim after eating pretty unhealthily during this Cowtown trip, we went on google and found what was closest with the highest rating. Which brings us to Nami Sushi and Grill. Beautiful Sunny afternoon led us to the patio in this quiet restaurant off 17th Ave. Basically empty aside from just one other table on the patio occupied. Decorated with Just-Eat stickers and restless wait staff standing around, the impression and expectations for the rest of this sushi trip was set. Generic and lengthy menu with overly pushy staff that seemed a little too quick to rush us out. Food was decent, prices were fair; but overall, meh. Service didn't cut it for me and I'm sure there are better places around the area for a more memorable sushi experience. 

Assorted Sashimi - ($26.95) - 4/5 - 15 pieces of 5 different kinds, which came out to be salmon, tuna, octopus, and amberjack. Presentation was beautiful, slices were thick and big. I guess you're getting the bang for your buck with this order. Tasted fresh and decent- not totally melt in your mouth fresh or anything but curbed our hunger and sushi pains. 

Salmon Battera - ($10.50) -  - My love for pressed sushi in unreal. Seeing this on the menu made me ecstatic. Torched salmon with avocado and a nice savory creamy glaze on the top. This was so satisfying, my favorite of the dining experience."}
{"text":"This place has very tasty, very fresh sushi and the prices are so low - I almost feel guilty.  I have never been full for $18.  Go to this place - help it survive.  Everything about it is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and snack after the Fringe festival today and were so impressed! super tasty and fresh and delicious! we will be back for a full course! thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is always reliable! Well priced for downtown-area sushi and also offer a discount for pick-up. If you like sashimi, you know it's not easy to find a decent spot in Alberta... But this place is solid."}
{"text":"Love this place. Me and wife just wanted a place we could walk to a couple weeks ago and got a big surprise with great prices sushi and fantastic customer service. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout that we ordered online. Food was on time, tasty and good value! Things to note: sashimi pieces are very large and the Red Dragon roll was more sweet than spicy."}
{"text":"You know that friend who's always there for you?  Good times and bad?  You can just show up at their house and your friend serves all the awesome sashimi and maki you can handle and charges really reasonable price?  Nami is that friend.

I like Nami's simple sushi... miso soup, sashi, Mali rolls, no frills.  The wait staff are nice, VERY quick, and I've never had anything to complain about."}
{"text":"Ordered food. Didnt show up, had to call in, total confusion and had to cancel the order as was not going to wait for a second hour."}
{"text":"The Beltline has a new affordable place for sushi! I'm a fan, more of the nigiri and maki rolls than the sashimi, which was still frozen when I got home. In terms of value, Nami has no competition. A big party platter costs $30.00. I ordered the Nami Tower for $35, which was more than enough food for two people. I'm going to pick up a platter for future parties, and I want to try the chicken teriyaki don, which I hear from a reliable source is stellar."}
{"text":"THE SUSHI WAS SOOOO GOOD. the flames maki was the best! The pieces were really big and the flavour was rich. Comparable to the ones I had in Japan."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I meet about once a month for lunch, and have been trying to pick a new ethnicity each time -- we've done Korean, Italian, Dutch, Vietnamese, you get the idea -- and this time we landed on Japanese. 
After wading through TONS of Yelp reviews, we finally found one that wasn't just devoted to Sushi. We love teriyaki and tempura, but neither of us are huge Sushi fans. I chose Nami after learning they had lunch bento boxes. Unfortunately, the Bento box choices are pretty non-existent if you did not want sushi or sashimi. 
So instead we placed a large order of beef teriyaki and a platter of tempura. The teriyaki was absolutely delicious! The tempura was a little (and honestly just a little ) on the greasy side ( not sure how you avoid that since it's all deep-fried...it it temperature related?) BUT that being said, the better was beautifully light and crispy and the portions were generous. 
Definitely worth a stop. 
Parking is a total bear though. Very little available, and it's all 1 hour. Be prepared to search...."}
{"text":"I have had Sushi all over Calgary and this is the best.

We found this place by accident only because it seems to be the only Sushi restaurant open on a Sunday. Their prices are comparable to that of Vancouver, and the employees are all so polite and friendly. 
Their rolls are delicious, fresh and well made. 

This is my go to."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter eat here weekly. Fantastic service and food is wonderful. Always quickly delivered to the table. I love the chilli chicken. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is in a busy area on 14th st, near 17th ave. Parking is not easy, but it was worth the trip. Small venu with a nice patio for the warm days. I had the Alaska roll, some tuna sashimi and spider roll. The fish was great quality. I wished I had gotten more sashimi! One of the better sushi places in Calgary that I've true thus far."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Nami because their sushi looks beautiful in photos. I liked the thinner rice layer surrounding the sushi. However, the atmosphere was so-so, a bit too dark and cave-like for my preferences. That said, my rating is more-or-less based on the food. 

The pumpkin soup (which I think was actually made from kabocha squash) was delicious, but the hokkigai and tako sashimi were not very fresh and were obviously frozen. We also got the grilled saba box sushi with ginger and green onion but we weren't too impressed. I found the rice to be a bit too sweet and the ginger a little overpowering, but the saba was good. The veggie roll we got was tasty and I enjoyed the thinner rice layer. Last but not least, we ordered the Nami roll which was the best tasting thing we ordered. The deep fried unagi was tasty with an extra crunch and the spicy tuna topping on the sushi was also tasty. I really like that they use a thinner rice layer."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi in town but their take away prices are very competitive. Been there few times and service was always very friendly. Overall, not a bad option at all."}
{"text":"Mini and I wandered by and decided to stop in. We have a pretty standard order anywhere new. Gyoza, cucumber roll, mango roll, salmon nigiri. Today we ordered those as well as the tempura veggies and a vegetable roll. 

The mango roll wasn't my favorite, I'm guessing because of the smoked salmon. The rolls are very small and packed tightly but they are all the same price for the special rolls. 

The cucumber and vegetable rolls were perfect, and the gyoza was delicious. The nigiri wasn't my favorite in yyc. The sushi rice was too sweet for my liking (and I drink Moscato, this girl loves sweet) but the fish was fresh. I wish it had be chilled slightly but I'm nitpicking.

The service was out of this world and when we left they gave use a coupon for $5 off our next visit. I will definitely go back to try more of their extensive menu."}
{"text":"So given that this place has such great reviews and ratings, I decided to take my friend who is a sushi lover here. It really did not stand up to either of our expectations to be honest. We went here for lunch and the parking situation was not bad given that its close to 17th ave -
there are some spots available behind Cibo that are free for 2 hours. The restaurant was not busy and we were seated right away. 

We ordered the spicy roll combo and the assorted sushi combo. The spicy roll combo comes with 8 pieces of spicy salmon roll, 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll and 8 pieces of the spicy dynamite roll ($16.95). Although, the combo was named 'spicy' combo, it was not spicy in the least. Also, the tempura shrimp in the dynamite roll was not fresh making it tough to chew. The assorted sushi combo came with 8 pieces of california roll and 7 different kids of sushi ($16.50). There was red and white tuna, shrimp, egg, and salmon rolls. My friend did not like it - she also mentioned that it didn't taste fresh to her. Also, she did not finish her california rolls which says a lot because she doesn't like to waste food. 

Overall, I felt like the quality of the rolls were not fresh. The upside was that it was a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Came here late on a late Sunday afternoon after a very short notice from my friends. Hungry like the wolves, they couldn't wait and decided to order without me! I need new friends.

When I walked in, I did not smell fish which is a good sign. We ordered about 5 special sushi rolls with each roll cut into about 8 pieces of sushi. I've enjoyed them all with the Las Vegas Roll being my favorite and the Alberta Roll being my least favorite. What I really liked about these rolls was the amount of rice. None of the rolls were stuffed with rice and for just under $10 each, you get a fair amount of good fish. However, I think they used a little too much sauce.

We also had a couple of bowls filled with sashimi and cucumbers, and a chicken noodle dish. It would be nice to know what my friends ordered so I can share with you but no, their stomachs took over their minds and they ordered without me. I think they used ramen noodles which I like. On both the sashimi bowls and chicken noodle dish however, I feel that they've again used too much sauce which makes it a little salty. More so than the sushi rolls.

All the food came really fast as well. 3 stars seem too low. I would give this place a 3.5. The bill came to just under $90 for 5 people. For that price, I think it's a good deal for the quality and quantity. I wouldn't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"Sorry for the bad picture, i already started to eat in it! 
Here is the vegetarian box !!
Really happy with my choice, lot of food, good taste in general, i will definitely order at this place again"}
{"text":"Top knotch sushi - best I've had in Calgary. We found out from the owner that they're from Vancouver, where the competiton is extremely fierce for good japanese (hence the unbeatable, never-before-seen cheap prices here for great quality). I'll probably make this place my sole go-to for Japanese because I'm now a devoted convert after just one visit. Literally - huge rolls... all under $10??? The nigiri and sashimi prices are more recognizeable but I am definitely trying them out next time. The location is higher end of decent - 17th ave but not too busy. There's Community Natural Foods nearby and of course the expanse of 17th."}
{"text":"I lived in Vancouver and I had been searching for a sushi place for years that is Vancouver grade when I came to Calgary for university and this place is amazing. Fish is fresh, service is great, would recommend to anyone. I get sushi so often here that they know me. They also have a huge menu with lots of special rolls and unique maki."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nami for a few years now, and it's too bad I have to update my review from 5 stars to 3 stars. 

I remember Nami as a place that you could trust to have reliable, decent quality sushi for extremely reasonable prices. However, the last few times I went the quality has been going down notably. Most recently I went for happy hour (2-4PM Monday-Thurs), and the all the rolls I had were worse than grocery store sushi. While the fish content was still pretty decent, the rice was completely soggy and sticky and the rolls were almost unrecognizable. 

The price was awesome, for $3 a roll, but that can't even come close to excusing the awful rice. 

I have also started to notice that an average dinner at Nami without sashimi ends up being about the same as a decent AYCE dinner ($28), so I've pretty much stopped going to Nami. Overall in a pinch its still okay, but if I don't see improvement next time I'm there I'll probably stop going."}
{"text":"Solid sushi restaurant and very reasonably priced. The battera rolls are a favourite for me. The nami tower gives you a little bit of everything to try.  They also give 10% off for takeout. Just keep in mind that if they're busy the takeout can take much longer than expected."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it, simple, fresh, great mix of flavors!! And the price is awesome :) yay new fave spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. The food is always great! Even when I order delivery, it's just as good. The tempura and spring rolls are still crispy when the food arrives. The prices are great and you get decent portions...particularly the lunch boxes! The spicy roll combo is delicious and I love the crazy boy roll. I've only ever had good experiences with this restaurant and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Did a take out for me and my girlfriend on new years eve and we were both impressed with value and quality.

We decided to splurge a bit for the new years and got ourselves a wakame salad, party tray b (take out only) and assorted sashimi.  The thickness of the sashimi were almost equal to the ones in Vancouver and they were very fresh and delicious.  The party tray featured 3 pieces of assorted nigiri and although a bit on the smaller size they were still good. 

Overall I would definitely go back to this place and recommend takeout from this place"}
{"text":"Definitely 5 stars. Fast serving food, friendly staff. Sushi dummies best choice in town.
The only thing is Udon soup, the noodle is not chewing enough."}
{"text":"Nami gets an update to five stars. This has become a regular haunt of mine and it fires on all cylinders: price, service, and most importantly the deliciousness of the food. Everything here is good and made with care. My suggestion is the spicy tuna nigiri: It's done gunkan style (the \"boat\" with nori as the vessel- you see this with eg uni and salmon roe all time), macerated tuna with crispy bits of tempura in a savoury spicy sauce- it's unbearably good and I'll order four of these. Rolls are just fantastic too. And again there are few sushiya in Calgary or really anywhere in North America where you can get this sort of quality and walk out having spent less than $20. Having just spent two months in Europe and enduring what passes for sushi there- overpriced and almost universally horrible- it's so, so nice to be back and to go to Nami."}
{"text":"Their sushi is really yummy and very fairly-priced. I wasn't a fan of their udon soup at all, it was very bland. Their sushi though, is great. I got an 8-piece deep-fried California roll for $6! Their monkey brain (appetizer, $10) is super yummy, though the name of the dish is unappetizing. Haha"}
{"text":"Sushi is typically not great for vegetarians and so I usually avoid it because as much as I love rice and cucumbers and avocados it's usually not that satisfying. 

However, Nami might just convert me into a sushi regular. They have a super awesome vegetarian sushi combo that came with a good variety of rolls. The yam tempura roll, inari, and avocado sashimi were my favourites. Nothing had cream cheese in it thankfully because I hate cream cheese, even though I've never tried it, I just know that I do. The vegetable rolls were probably the worst; they didn't have much flavour and all I could really taste was the shredded carrot. 

My friends shared the tower which actually does come in a three tiered tower. They commented that the fish portions were surprisingly big and the tower was demolished by the end of the night so I can only assume everything tasted good. A new local favourite!"}
{"text":"This location has been cursed but Nami may be turning the curse around with its fair prices and fresh sushi. I recommend the emerald roll which had yam tempura, avocado and spicy mayo. Can't wait to go back and sit on the cute patio for 4.50 Stella and 4.50 saki bombs!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's close to my house, it's speedy, it's really good sushi. Oh, and the best part - it's reasonably priced! In Calgary! (I know, I couldn't believe it either, but it's true - good quality reasonably priced sushi in Calgary.)

I have a few faves...

Party tray (to go only) - you know, when you want to have your friends over for a boozy wine night on your balcony and you're too lazy to cook and need some little alcohol sponges to sop up the booze. $29 for 58 pieces. The yam tempura roll is really really good.

California roll (I know, it's cliche, but I love a good california roll) - 8 pieces, more crab than rice, and under $4. 

Salmon sashimi - fresh, decent size, and reasonably priced. Yay protein!

Booze (you know me well enough to know that booze is a great accompaniment to a meal...or no meal) - domestic bottles $3.50, wine - not amazing, but a great deal.

If I lived within a block of this place I probably would just have sushi for dinner every single night. You should too!

Bottom line - good quality and excellent value. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Good sushi in downtown... I liked the monkey brain appetizer with fried avocado... The nigiri was just ok... Nothing really special... But the specialty rolls were very good all of them... I think I would go back but only for rolls... The service was slower than I would prefer but nothing really bad...."}
{"text":"Awesome service price and very fun. Food was excellent.  Much love from San Jose California.  Hiyaaaaaaaaaa"}
{"text":"Was visiting my sister in Calgary and we were craving sushi so we called Nami for delivery.  They were awesome!  Customer service was great -- they were friendly, helpful, and really took care to make sure our order was correct.  The menu was pretty normal for a sushi place, and honestly my expectations weren't very high but that was a mistake on my part!  The maki rolls, soup, and appetizers were very well made, and were tasty.  Prices were great too!  The delivery guy found our place in a very confusing neighbourhood with no trouble at all.  We will definitely order from Nami again when I'm back in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for years for a place that does a good chicken roll (as much as I want to love fish, I just cant :(  
Nami does a chicken roll that you can avocado or cream cheese or cucumber to and it is AWESOME. Ive ordered twice in 4 days :)
Their yam fries and spring rolls are also fantastic. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch, Great place to meet up with friends or business associates.  The fish us surprisingly fresh and some of their delicious combinations are a once in a lifetime experience that should not be missed.  The staff is unbelievably accommodating to new to sushi patrons."}
{"text":"The price is right at Nami for my sushi fix!
Though sometimes the rolls don't look as pretty, you really get the bang for your sushi buck.

The rolls are tasty, tempura is good, nice miso soup, the sashmi has been thawed for my experiences.
And 10% off on pick-up orders.

I ordered a boat load of sushi for me and my husband, this amount/variety usually costs us around $50 a few blocks down, but at Nami it was $34!

And when you walk in all the staff will greet you in unison, uttering out a cry of hello, but Id on't actually know what they say.

They also have a patio! Not that I have ever eaten sushi on a patio, but might be nice to grab a Sapporo after work when the 14th Street traffic has died down."}
