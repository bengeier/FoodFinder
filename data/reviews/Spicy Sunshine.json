{"text":"Happened into Spicy Sunshine and met the owner Rob Nichols and I'm glad I did. Had \"Rob's Original\" BBQ sandwich with the fixins plus grabed an order of Fried Green Tomatoes. OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very original.  I could eat here everyday. Everything is made in house and I'm hooked on the fried green tomatoes. Everything I have tried is awesome and you are not finding quality like this at this price anywhere. I am adding to this post because I tried the brisket and that sandwich is awesome I could eat one every day. Most brisket sandwiches are a little on the dry and tough side and that is totally not the case with this one. I also tried the growler and if barbecue is not your thing but you like turkey I highly recommend this also but seriously I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. I  plan on trying the dunked wings next and I don't think I mentioned this before but all of the sides are great!"}
{"text":"Spicy Sunshine is amazing!  Some of the best home style food in Charlotte and at great prices.  The fried green tomatoes are the best.  The owner is friendly,  welcoming and knowledgeable. Must taste!!"}
