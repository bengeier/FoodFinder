{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in the area and we've tried many. We've tried just about every pizza they offer. My husband loves the fact that the Hula Hula has pineapple that tastes like pineapple. None of the tasteless canned pineapple here. There is a lot of meat too as there is both ham and Canadian bacon. Yes. Go ahead and debate whether pineapple belongs on pizza, but if tasty Hawaiian is your thing, you'll enjoy the Hula Hula. The mango chicken pizza was unique. My favorite is the Hot Picante because it is actually hot (not unbearably hot, but you can taste it) and I find that other pizza joints aren't as spicy as they lead you to believe. Another pizza we can both agree upon is the Grandmother's because it's loaded with a lot of good stuff without falling apart when you pick it up. We love that the crust isn't greasy and the sauce is flavorful. Everyone who has been over to our place for a pizza party always asks who we order from and if we can give them a menu. And the staff at Mother's is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Mothers Pizza creates delicious, ingredient-loaded pizzas which never leave you feeling greasy. The price is great and the delivery is good as well. Sometimes it takes longer than expected for delivery, but, I will always wait patiently for Mothers Pizza. I love the house special, as it is always loaded with tons of fresh toppings. The crust is beautiful. We usually order delivery and have not visited the actual location."}
