{"text":"A very good neighborhood coffee place. Superb coffee and pastries.   The place is small but cozy, one table inside and a bench outside. Two nice girls make great coffee. The place smells so good!  Come in the morning, chat with the girls, grab a cappuccino and go with a smile."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is great plus I left my IPhone 7 there without knowing .. I call it back and got the boss on the phone who told me that he found it on a table  tkx a lot to him"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop in Monkland village. Always make a point to stop by whenever I walk by :)"}
{"text":"Cute clean and cozy. BEST Cappuccino I've had in Montreal, they even had soy milk :). Also tried their salted caramel cookie so delicious. The owner is an older gentlemen who greets you warmly amd makes sure you are enjoying your coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent cappuccinos  - always warm service, reminds me of Italy. Nice outside chairs and tables , cozy inside.  I've grown attached to it.  Bonus is homemade takeaway dinner portion pasta, sauces, meatballs etc at reasonable prices right next door!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal on vacation but when I came here for coffee I felt like a local!The owners were awesome made us feel so welcome! It's a  friendly and cozy atmosphere with the best coffee. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee spot for an early morning jump start to your day, or have a seat at the window bar and warm up people watching as they walk down the street"}
{"text":"I stopped in for an almond milk latte and vegan blueberry muffin, and I can only say I wish I could bring this place back with me to Toronto!  The staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and the coffee is second-to-none.   The cafe is beautifully decorated off Notre Dame. I sat and read a book for a while I enjoyed my latte and muffin.   WiFi is available, and the staff speaks both French and English.   I'll be back every day I have left on my trip, and any time I'm in Montreal in the future.   For the vegans: there are a number of pastry options! There are also gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions.   What a gem, this place!  Latte ($4) Vegan Muffin ($3) - three flavors available"}
{"text":"Very cosy cafe with delicious goodies and very good Italian coffees.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Café de' Mercanti is that type of cafe you want to keep hidden for yourself and a few locals. However, I have dismissed these feelings after reflecting upon the greater reality I have thanks to Yelp.  And though it does not demand it, I want to respect my link to Yelp by sharing this review and these pictures of the café that is de' Mercanti.  Mercanti is found on Monkland where it's just busy enough to give the pleasant feel of a cosmopolitan café though equally tranquil for introspective activities.    It's an Italian café (with an Italian épicerie just adjacent) with some elements of the more old-school Italian sport cafés you find in little Italy (ie the television), though beauty and elegance permeate the space: marble, an array of Italian pastries, shiny moka pots, imported packaged treats, well displayed gelato, and fine service.   I want to go back."}
{"text":"Perfect place to sit and relax over a cup of cappuccino or macchiato on a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"Simply put, the best coffee in the neighbourhood. Never bitter, but full of body and taste. Their baked goods are also great."}
{"text":"Ron is awesome. Go here and feel like a local! Delicious coffee and the Nutella horns are a must! Great Montreal experience. Cozy, friendly atmosphere with great great quality food and drink."}
{"text":"Great Italian cafe. The friendly couple who own it are more than helpful. Great quality coffee and pastries! A very nice addition to Monkland!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee in old montreal. Great staff and the place is absolutely beautiful!"}
{"text":"I took my son for a stroll today and stopped by this cafe for a Mocha.. I gave the order and my coffee was ready fairly quickly.. I stepped out and took the first sip of my drink, realizing not only it wasn't hot, it wasn't even lukewarm! Very disappointed that the barista wasn't patient enough to get the milk temperature right.. in a day that there wasn't a single person in the line other than me!"}
{"text":"The 2 coffees were good.  No internet access and no excuse for it.    I was asked to move since artists were hanging their art on the cafe's walls  I guess I came in renovation day? It was hard to enjoy while hammering was going on inside."}
{"text":"Really worth a visit, and it's just a few steps away from the busier parts of Old Montreal. The coffee drinks are delicious and the pastries are amazing. We loved the salted caramel cookie, the Nutella Horn and the chocolate brownie. The chocolate brownie was just unbelievably soft and tasty, and the cookie had the perfect balance of salt and sugary-ness. It was hard to believe the brownie was vegan and gluten free! We loved it"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood place. The coffee is great and is made the way it is made in Italy. They have a variety of pastries and a huge assortment of imported Italian goodies. I haven't tried the hot chocolate yet but it looks absolutely decadent. It's become my go to place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Jolie petit endroit pour  boire un bon café et manger un énorme cookie! Le jour où j'y suis allee nous avons pu profiter de la terrasse :)"}
{"text":"This is what you get when you mash up Dispensa with Olive and Gourmando. Great sandwiches, delicious house-baked pastries, expertly prepared italian-style (not 3rd wave) coffee. Lovely people, quick service. Not a lot of tables, but enough (for now). $15 for a sandwich, drink, coffee and cookie."}
{"text":"Café de' Mercanti translates to Merchant's coffee and this charming Italian jewel definitely sports its name well.   Sure you'll see local residents stumble in for their regular order, or tourists waltzing in from Montreal Old Port and Old Town but noteworthy is the number of local business people buzzing in for their morning fix and take off as quickly as they came in!  This wonderful cafe is small, so perhaps a bit tough to accommodate big groups but has great atmosphere, the owners offer the best service and you'll enjoy solid espressos, lattes and many other classic Italian coffees. Noteworthy are the mouth weathering pastries which are made fresh every day - you won't regret it.  Picture perfect biscotti, cornetto, cannoli, chunky double chocolate or caramel & sea salt cookies are strategically laid out to entice you. Oh oh oh and don't forget about the gorgeous vanilla custard lemon bombolini, a seasonal treat, so get' em while you can! And before you ask, there is a delicious choice or gluten free and vegan treats to choose from.  Cleverly displayed are also some staple \"to go\" items such as tomato sauces, pasta, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, marinated olives, salts, chips, juices... all Made in Italy!  Next time i'll try the panini sandwiches and gelato... hope you will too!"}
{"text":"Great location.  Off the busy tourist street but still convenient.  Super friendly staff who take alot of pride in serving top notch coffee, pastries, gelato, and sandwiches. And don't miss their delicious croissants! Very clean, tasteful decor."}
{"text":"Great unique expreso beverages with pastries that are divine. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I have tried more than 15 places for cappuccino all over Montreal and this was my favorite!  So nice and creamy, yet not too heavy.  The perfect balance!"}
{"text":"Klein und fein - sowohl das italienische Café als auch der Kaffee (Latte u. Cappuccino) und der Schoko-Nuss-Biscuit."}
{"text":"The best coffee shop I've been. The owner's always friendly and he makes great coffee.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Better than average coffee.   Decent deserts.  Nice ambiance.   Better in summer when terrace is open. A little west of monkland village, so less people watching."}
{"text":"Really lovely Italian cafe, great service. The coffee is fabulous.     Once more people find out about this little jewel of a place it's going to have a line out the door!    You should go - very pretty inside, nice people working there."}
{"text":"This cafe is right around the corner which pretty much saved my life many a time since my boyfriend didn't have a coffee machine for MONTHS!  Friendly staff, great service cozy, welcoming atmosphere and amazing coffee & treats!   10/10"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent café and pastries. Lovely service with a smile. Very authentic; wonderfully cozy. Walked here many times for my cuppa, despite several other coffee shops between it and the place I was staying. Would definitely seek it out if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Great new coffee place in the heart of old montreal. Perfect coffee, great atmosphere and the staff is super attentive.  Of you're around Place Jacques Cartier, walk a few steps towards the east on Notre-Dame and you'll be home!"}
{"text":"Did not know this new coffee shop opened up in Dec 2015 in my area but yelp helped me discover it today.  A great mix - half independent coffee shop, half italian coffee shop. Coffee was very good, loved the window view and wi-fi on top of that. Turn right as you walk in the door otherwise you're in the wrong place. Saw some people get sandwiches that looked quite good."}
{"text":"Perfect cup of coffee for people who know what a great latte or expresso should taste like. Very friendly. Charming cafe in the old part of Montreal."}
{"text":"The best coffe you than you can try in all montreal. The places is amazing a good environment!, the best in town absolutely!!"}
{"text":"Really cute and small cafe. The owner was super sweet and offered an espresso on the house when I asked him questions about the coffee beans. The coffee was super smooth, but very dark. I bought beans to give away as a present and forgot to tell the receiver it was for espresso (whoops) and he made it super dark. I wish I could contact the owner to ask how much should be used for an americano!"}
{"text":"Their cappuccino is the best thing can ever have in Montreal. I fell in love with their cannoli, super nice and fresh. They have a verity of pastries and delicacies but their cannoli is the best I tried so far.   They got the shop beside hem and they have a larger room inside where you can have your coffee."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the area!  The deserts (especially the ice cream) and sandwiches are also great.  I strongly recommend the Affogato (espresso with a scope of ice cream...best with hazelnut ice cream)."}
{"text":"Vraiment, c'est champion. Beau comme tout, le café est délicieux, la présentation est jolie, il y a des boîtes de produits directement venus d'Italie qu'on peut acheter, des gâteaux, des biscuits, d'autres bonnes choses pour se sucrer le bec, le barista est trilingue (ou plus, qui sait) et gentil comme une brise printanière. Ça c'est du service!  La plupart des clients de fin de journée semblent être des habitués, mais on s'y sent comme à la maison, même si c'est notre première fois. Beaucoup de familles et peu de place: 10 places assises aux tables et 4-5 bancs près du comptoir. On ne se sent pas pressés pour autant, il y a beaucoup de commandes pour emporter.   J'y retournerai volontiers!"}
{"text":"Best coffee I have had in Montreal. Thank you to all the other reviews that directed me here."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best espressos I've ever had.  We ordered a brasilieno, a cappuccino and a pastry filled with Nutella that was crispy and delicious. Ron was incredibly attentive and crafted our drinks with much detail.   This was a great coffee stop after lunch. I'd highly recommend it to anyone visiting Old Montreal and in need of a coffee fix. My boyfriend and I joked around and said this might be our regular stop if we lived in MTL haha. It's that good, and I'm a Starbucks fanatic but the brasilieno I had beats a Starbucks espresso any day."}
{"text":"Tiny place but great true Italian coffee and hot fresh croissants   Glad to discover this place"}
{"text":"My fav coffee shop so far. Cozy little place. Fair prices, very nice staff. What I recommend: amazing sandwiches (eggplant it's a MUST) if you are hungry, delicious cannoli and a hot chocolate to die!  Oh, and just before spring they sell zeppole, so sad they don't make them all year long."}
{"text":"Small servings of very fresh, delicious coffee. Sort of the anti-Starbucks--portions are much smaller than even the smallest Starbucks coffee, but the coffee is  a lighter roast very flavourful and not bitter."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop with excellent service. A must, when visiting Montreal! The expression was excellent. I had a blonde brownie and it was perfect! Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I spent hours in here. Beautiful art work on the walls too."}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place highly enough. It's so cute inside and the coffee and pastries are amazing! We stopped in for a cappuccino and the Nutella horn (mouth watering!) and met the wonderful and friendly Ron! Definitely check this spot out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, excellent selection of fresh treats, including a good variety available gluten free. Also a lovely terrasse, it's a weekend favourite!"}
{"text":"One of the best and most smooth tasting coffee I've had. I had the Cafe americano with a shot of milk and would definitely recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"Nice traditional Italian style cafe with clean simple decor. I enjoyed a cappuccino with dashes of cinnamon and cocoa and a bombolone. I'm a huge fan of bombolone and I am pleased to say this one did not disappoint. The quantity of cream was adequate and the flavor was on point!"}
{"text":"Small, cozy café that has become for me an obligate Sunday stop! Although i have yet to try it myself, the sight and the smell of their sandwiches & pastries have tested my will power more than once. The only issue is that they close pretty early but otherwise, a little Monkland gem!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian cafe located in NDG. They have a pretty decent variety of pastries and Italian sodas. The biscotti had me salivating across the glass display. The latte I ordered was full in flavour and had a creamy, silky texture. Coffee lovers - this place is a must."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick pick me up on your way through Old Montréal, you shouldn't stop anywhere but Café de' Mercanti! With a multitude of delicious pastries to choose from and some of the best coffee in Montreal (the mocha may have been the best mocha I've had anywhere) you will definitely find something for anyone to enjoy.  Most notably, when I asked the owner for recommendations for places to go in the city he came up with a very detailed list for me and my friends and made sure we were set up for a wonderful trip! I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed talking with the staff. The cannoli was delicious. Would definitely go back for more of their tasty treats and great coffee beans!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, but no speciality drinks like flavored lattes or mochas.  Gentleman making the drinks was very nice."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this cafe as soon as I entered the place. I like the TV playing, the cozy atmosphere, it is really like being in your living room except you're drinking a fabulous latte and you have a whole range of typical Italian pastries to choose from. I recommend the sfogliatella : it's heaven in your mouth. The staff is cool and despite the fact that the room is small, it's still very comfortable. A jewel on Monkland!! Will return for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We walked by Mercanti on our way to another cafe and loved the look of it so much that we stopped in. I had a latte, my boyfriend had a cappuccino, and we shared a ham and cheese croissant. All three were heavenly. The staff was great and the brick walls were beautiful and welcoming. I meant to take pictures, but we ate too quickly!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by for coffee. The staff is super friendly. Their desserts are awesome. Try the lemon cake or everyone's favorite, the Nutella horns."}
{"text":"We went to get gelato for my toddler. Picked the mango flavor and it was really good. He ate the whole thing! Service here was excellent. There's a room in the back with ample seating but it was not air conditioned and ended up being like a furnace in mid July. The outdoor seating was much nicer. We enjoyed the gelato but it was a bit difficult to manage a kid here."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and fair prices! Artsy and cosy, so it's excellent for an afternoon chat with friends or to do some studying! I tried their decaf latte and Americano, both quite good :) It's really relaxing to be here because it's in a quiet neighbourhood and the interior decor very tasteful. I would recommend this café to all of you!"}
{"text":"A perfect delight. The vegan pistachio blondie was great, bright and moist; flavorful and rich espresso. And incredibly friendly service."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee shop!  In additional to regular desserts, they offer many varieties of gluten-free desserts."}
{"text":"Great espressos and super friendly staff! Loved it here. I didn't eat but my companion was eyefucking the pizza the entire time."}
{"text":"Davide makes great Latte Perfect location as I live few minutes  away ... Decor is comfy and warm. Gelatos are great!!!"}
{"text":"Small place with wonderful smelling of coffee, nice terrasse, croissants et crême glacé disponible, original choice of ice cream : \"Pinnaple and Basil\" just delicious !!"}
{"text":"After having this place on my list forever I went for coffee today. I had heard great things from others... Overall cute cafe located on Monkland away from all the restaurants, bars and other coffee shops.   I am huge latte lover and went for one of course. Sadly, I wasn't really impressed. The foam wasn't that great and that makes a huge difference. Having had many fabulous lattes, I am little harder to please  ;-)  Having said that it's a good place to try at least once when you're in the area :-)"}
