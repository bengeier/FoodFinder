{"text":"The wife and I decided to try Delallo's after seeing a nightmarishly long line at Pasta Too in South Park.  We were really in the mood for some no-frills Italian fare, with no regards towards ambiance.  Delallo's was a welcome addition to our list of restaurants tried.

The menu had all of your typical Italian staples, which, on this particular evening, was exactly what I was craving.  The decor and atmosphere was nothing innovative, but it was clean and the tables were clothed.  The service was pleasant and our orders were completed accurately.  Our meals were delicious and proportioned above averagely. 

This isn't your 'take-a-companion-you-really-want-to-impress' type of joint.  It's more of an 'I'm-in-an-established-relationship-and-we-just-want-a-hearty-meal' spot.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DeLallo's is simply THE best Italian restaurant in all of the south hills area. I cannot overstate how amazing their food is..it's fresh, delicious, and the staff is always courteous and attentive. We honestly must eat here at least 3-4 times a month. If you are looking for authentic, flavorful, and high-quality Italian food, then you must give these guys a try. 

Their fried zucchini appetizer is out-of-this-world amazing! The zucchini is hot, crispy, well-season and never greasy. And it's served with a side of their famous marinara. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little taste of Italy before their meal. 

For a main course, I'm always torn between my two favorite meals: the Chicken DeLallo and the Chicken Parmesan. The Chicken DeLallo is a chicken breast stuffed with crab, prosciutto and an Italian cheese with a white wine sauce. And the Chicken Parm is always cooked to perfection! It's crispy, yet moist on the inside and their marinara sauce is just absolutely amazing. 

For dessert: my family always get's the Tiramisu. You must try the Tiramisu, I'm so serious. It's totally the trifecta to a complete meal at DeLallo's. 

The service staff goes above and beyond their duty. Our waiter, whose name I'm blanking on (and I apologize, because you totally deserve a raise) was amiable and attentive. Overall the best customer service I've seen in years! 

Recommendation: call ahead for reservations. This restaurant is extremely popular every day of the week, I swear, unless you arrive just as their opening you'll likely have to wait for seating. 

10/10 would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and father both had the seafood sampler and I had their signature chicken dish- Chicken DeLallo I think? (sorry this was two months ago so I am struggling with details).  Most of us started with the wedding soup which was really delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ate. The seafood was fresh which was a huge bonus, and the bread was good Mancini's style bread. My father was a chef at fine dining establishments in Pittsburgh, so if he gave it a thumbs up, you can believe it will be good. Our server was attentive and professional, so no complaints there."}
{"text":"First time eating here, food was fabulous, nice old school Italian atmosphere. Our waitress was a little snippy, could've been a little nicer. Other than that good experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner there Friday night and it was very good. The walleye special was delicious. My wife had a steak and it was perfect. The lobster crab bisque was also very good. The sever was excellent.  He was very attentive and took care of all our needs. I would recommend this  restaraunt  for anybody. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great high-quality food! Very tasty Italian, and the veal is to die for! Make sure to stay for desert because it is very good!"}
{"text":"Great food.  I love these neighborhood gems where the wait staff recognize customers, and they have employees who have worked there from the very beginning.

A+ on the wedding soup.  
A+ on the broiled spots with crab meat.

Fresh food for a reasonable price.  You can't beat that."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW.  DeLallo's catered a small outside birthday party for me.  They were on vacation but took my emails and when we went to pay they had every detail right.  The beef was prime rib, the portions generous and all the details.  Included was paper products, coffee and even half and half-I hate powdered creamer.  I had so many compliments.  I'm from California but came to Pittsburgh for my birthday."}
{"text":"Una sera in DeLallo's

DeLallo's is a classy, homestyle Italian restaurant with white shirted, black bottom waiters and a roomy interior.  An evening at this fine restaurant begins by entering the doors and you will see the hostess  to the left and see a wide expanse of restaurant. You go to the right and you enter the bar. You go straight down the bar, hang a right and that's where we sat on Saturday with quite a few other tables. My dad and I were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and my uncle made us reservations for DeLallo's.  I was excited to visit after reading the menu in the car ride up.

Th evening continues with your water glass being promply filled and will remain filled throughout your meal.  The waitress comes to take orders, and the evenly paced meal begins with the ordering of our appetizers and meals. The menu is varied, but thorough and I had the impression that they would do a good job with anything you order. 

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and the greens and beans for appetizers.  The mushrooms were cooked well and stuffed with crab meat and sat in a light lemon butter sauce. The beans in the greens and beans were perfectly cooked and were dressed in a garlic slightly buttery sauce that is also good for dipping bread in.  The bread came slightly after and it was fine. It was soft and thick, but it was like a thick sandwich bread (I wasn't too impressed with that).

I ordered their ravioli for my entree and I could choose a salad or soup to go with it.  I choose the Italian Wedding Soup and it was quite tasty. The pasta and vegetables were cooked well and sat in a flavorful broth with tiny meatballs. I possibly could have had a big bowl of soup as my meal! It was delicious.  I ordered the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. The ravioli were cooked well, the cheese had a good texture and the meat sauce had a good flavor of spices; extra red pepper never hurt anyone though!  Overall, a delightful way to spend a Saturday night.

The Evening Breakdown,

The Food: Very good. I felt a lot of care went into the food and the soup was really good. Honestly, everything was really good.
The Experience: Very good. The waitstaff was attentive, the atmosphere was nice, the bathrooms were clean.
The Value: Well, my ravioli was $13 if I recall, the appetizers vary in price depending on what you get.  For the classy type of restaurant DeLallo's wants to be, I think the prices are fair and just.
Would I return?: If I was in Pittsburgh and my uncle wanted to go again then sure!
5 stars?: I can't think of any reason to give them 4 stars. DeLallo's does a good job and if you are thinking about giving them a try after a visit to South Hills Village, I think you'd be glad you did.  Grazie!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Clean. Professional. Even the bus kids wear bow ties. Everything is homemade from the sauce to the cheesecake. Its a grandma's recipe kind of place. Waitstaff is very nice and everyone keeps a smile. It is a must try. Very popular too."}
{"text":"Have had several dishes from this restaurant and consider their food to be consistently high in quality."}
{"text":"Customer service at the ownership level is extremely poor.  Reservations are ignored in favor of friends who walk in.  The food is good -- but do you want to wait an extra 45 minutes after your reservation time?  Do you want to watch others without reservations stroll to tables while you dodge the kitchen's swinging doors?  Pass on this place...there's plenty of others nearby that deliver delicious food AND quality service."}
{"text":"My fav restaurant in Pittsburgh,  Spots with crabmeat, cheese ravioli, sandwiches.  Everything is great and nice staff."}
{"text":"Rude, Unprofessional, Pompous, Aloof owner!

Two friends and I  visited this establishment this evening, never again! Long story short, one of my friends ordered something and after being sent back twice, was still wrong. Our waitress was no where to be found, therefore, we asked for manager who is actually the owner, waste of time. He didn't listen to problem ,was very abrupt, argumentative , and asked if she wanted something else. By this time the rest of party was done with meals and would have been the third time our friend would wait for a meal. No apology, no free dessert, nada, just an attitude and abrupt, I suppose in his little kingdom the customer is never right, only he is. Shortly afterwards, he was talking to a table with two of his loyal subjects about us since he was clearly pointing to us and the slick guy at table was talking with hand on face like a baseball coach discussing strategy on the pitching mound , was so obvious, juvenile, and pathetic with imp like behaviors. I've been here before, food is just ok, nothing outstanding, however, will never be back again, and will share this debacle with everyone I know."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this glorious restaurant!  Italian food at its finest - service even better!  Easy to get into, even on Friday or Saturday evenings.  Great atmosphere, not too quiet but not too loud to talk around the table.  This is our go to for GREAT Italian food whenever we have friends from out of town!  Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good not great! The beans and greens were excellent. The wedding soup had too much celery and tough meatballs. I'm Italian and the sauce just didn't do it for me, rather bland. The Chicken Romano was tender but lacked flavor.  Armstrong's Chicken Romano is remarkable! The individual butter packets for the bread was a bit tacky. Considering the price, nothing fabulous enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time and was very impressed. The food was excellent. The atmosphere was really nice. The service was perfect. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but the food was great and the service was even better. The pasta to fish was c enjoyed by everyone and we'll be going back again."}
{"text":"A rare letdown the other day. I ordered their special, Halibut Puttanesca.  The halibut itself was wonderful.  It was flavorful, moist, and buttery.  But the puttanesca was overly salty. It overpowered the subtle flavors of the fish. After the first bite, I had to scrape it off the remainder of my fish.  
The fried calamari and bruschetta were delicious, as usual.  Service was prompt and friendly, as usual. But to have your main dish be a letdown, especially at that price, took a lot of luster off the meal."}
{"text":"Delallos always seems to get it right. We celebrated several birthdays this evening and everything we ordered was fabulous. Mike our server and his assistants were very attentive and we never had an empty glass. 

Steak cooked perfectly. Appetizers were all fabulous. Chicken Delallo was divine! And as always the Virginia Spots with crab were Spot On Superb!"}
{"text":"This food was so good.  I came in for lunch and was so pleased.  When I walked in, I didn't know what to expect- the interior, while clean and tidy, was definitely a little dated and the clientele was far from young.  This place was amazing- the food was awesome! I had the Italian hot sausage sandwich, which came with a choice of fries, coleslaw, or soup.  I went with the wedding soup and loved it so much I picked up a quart of it to go. The sandwich was great- really nice authentic homemade Italian sausage and fresh bread.  My grandmother had coleslaw with her sandwich and remarked on how fresh it was as well.  

I live in the North Hills and will definitely be making a trip back here to eat again! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fetuccini Alfredo with grilled chicken is amazingly delicious.  Dinner comes with salad and bread. I ordered a glass of White Zinfandel and it paired well. Unusual outside looking building,  barn looking painted green. Don't be fool, I highly recommend it.  Dress attire is recommended and enforced.  Although I was wearing shorts & tank top with flip flops,  I was not turned away. \"GO Pirates\" I'm certain  they knew I was coming from PNC Park."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh, homemade, delicious.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Nice ambience.  Had the homemade cheese ravioli - very good and husband had eggplant parm - also very good.  The seafood chowder ws among the best we've had in the Pittsburgh area.  Probably need reservations on weekends.  Definitely, we will be going back.  Lots of different items on the menu that we'd like to try."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed. I've driven by this restaurant countless times and thought it was a deli. The food and service were outstanding. I had the chicken parm and the portion was huge for 18 bux that included soup/salad and a side. This may be my new favorite Italian restaurant in the south hills."}
{"text":"De Lallo's is housed in what looks like a big ol' barn. Inside it looks like a typical Italian restaurant circa 1959.  Their dinner menu is your basic steaks, chicken, veal, pasta, and pizza.  But I guess it still works 'cos the place is still pretty popular. 

So before heading out on the road with my Cousin Cindy (who lives nearby), I stopped in here for lunch.   I'd seen this place many times from the \"T\" while on my way to South Hills Village.  I tried the Chicken Parmesan sandwich which was decent enough.  The Italian Wedding Soup was really good though.  And I topped my lunch off with a good 
espresso."}
{"text":"Excellent food, reasonably priced, great atmosphere, great service. Scott waited on us and he was amazing. Expect a long wait on Saturday night. We arrived at 630pm without reservations, and were able to put our name on a list and were told to come back at 8pm. We were back at 740pm and were seated. Well worth the wait, though, but I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"We eat here almost weekly. The food and service is very consistent. My husband says the spots are the best in the city. I think their blackened salmon is the best also! We love the balsamic dressing, I could probably drink it. For light lunch options we often get the trio-salad or the chopped salad. For dinner I always get the Chicken Maremana (gluten-free)."}
{"text":"The service is really underwhelming, unless Dave is working at the desk. The quality of the food has diminished over time and the wait staff work hard to fix problems. If you're planning a special night, find a different place."}
{"text":"When traveling to a new city this KY boy tried to stay away from any chain restaurant and find a taste of local fare. DeLallo's was both a delicious and inviting options with perfectly mastered Italian dishes and warm, friendly staff who made you feel like you were right at home. Be sure an bring your appetite because these large portions of hearty food will definitely fill you up. A great find for this traveler in the south Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"Simply my favorite restaurant in the south hills. I eat lunch there everyday of the week. Best service best food around."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the South Hills!

I've been eating here for years. This is an \"old school\" type restaurant , but I don't mean that in  a bad way. It's family run, clean, semi-formal, and a very nicely laid out, comfortable place to eat. Service is always outstanding, and they have a lot of long time waitresses, which speaks well of the ownership.

The food leans toward Italian, which is no surprise, and it's far and away the best Italian food in the South Hills. Ravioli is excellent - try it with their authentic marinara sauce. It's a chunky type sauce with olive oil, tomatoes, and vegetables. Really fresh tasting and different. Goes great with the meat or cheese ravioli's. Also recommended is the seafood ravioli! Try it with the Tomato Basil cram sauce. Outstanding!

Seafood dishes are also top notch. Love their Spots. I'm not sure if they're always available, but if they are, order them. Also have a high quality fish sandwich - I do wish they went to regular fries though instead of the thick wedge fries they serve. 

I've never had anything but an outstanding meal at DeLallo's!"}
{"text":"Called about catering and got berated for even asking if an event could have food before 11."}
{"text":"Broiled VA Spots with butter lemon sauce, salad with White French Dressing.  Can you ask for anything better than this??  Great service, ambience, and very reasonable."}
{"text":"Old school Italian \"joint\" that does not disappoint. My party primarily stuck with the restaurant's specialities. My husband's red clam sauce was delicious and my spots with crabmeat were delectable. We'll certainly return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for delicious italian food and our expectations were met at DeLallo's! My boyfriend ordered the blackened chicken alfredo and I had linguine pasta with lump crab meat, plum tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic and oil.  Both meals were delicious and filling! I ordered a strawberry shortcake to go which was also really yummy :)"}
{"text":"Another reviewer summed it up perfectly - not a date-night place, but solid, on-point red-sauce-Italian, dated decor (but impeccably clean) waitstaff that's been there forever and knows most of the clientele, the exact place you want to go for spaghetti and meatballs, beans and greens, and homemade cheesecake. You'll have enough food left for lunch the next day and you'll leave feeling cozy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite in the south hills ! Love the wedding soup, salt sticks my fav. Also wonderful salad. If you like shrimp the have a shrimp Mediterranean that melts in your mouth. Very reasonable for the amount of food excluded in the price . I give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"The best dish that I ever had in any restaurant is the veal piccata.  It's too good to describe."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and think this is a great alternative to all the chain restaurants in the area. You'll find people here dressed up but others dressed very casually. Both of the meals I've had here were good but the standout selection here is the wedding soup. I don't know what they do, but it is by far the best wedding soup I have ever had.

The only bad thing I can say about the place is the service is slow."}
{"text":"We been there several times and never a disappointment. Best kept secret in the south hills."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent!  We were in town on business and would definitely recommend this as a must-try for the area.  Just allow time for a long dinner as service was not speedy, but the food was worth every minute of the wait!"}
{"text":"We don't go out for dinner much...Why? I'm very critical when paying premium prices for mostly sub-par food! Well tonight we had the BEST dinner from start to finish we have had in a very long time! DeLallo's in Bethel Park, Chef Reggie and the wait staff have their game down to a science! One dish was better than the next...I opted for the perfectly prepared prime rib, my partner was a bit more adventurous ordering the Barramundi...they have outstanding Italian Wedding soup, perfectly prepared salads and main courses that are to die for!  Even the basket of bread they brought to our table was delicious. We finished the meal with a great cup of coffee and the Chef's house made Tiramisu... I have passed this restaurant a thousand times, never venturing inside until this evening...Wow have we been missing out! We have found our new favorite restaurant...which by the way is only a mile and a half from our home...prices are good, food is outstanding you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"De Lallo's is awesome. Tonight Judee and I went there for our 25th anniversary dinner. Some folks dress up, others casual. Being our anniversary we started with a bottle of wine - a Chianti Ruffino, $26.00 not so bad for a restaurant. As an appetizer we ordered one of our favorites here - Green's and Beans with extra garlic. Basically they take a green, escarole, kale or turnip greens (what is in season), saute until wilted with garlic and olive oil and a bit of chicken broth. Toss in some cannellini beans (white kidney beans). Have a hearty Italian bread (Mancini's preferred) with butter on the side to sop up the flavor. YUMMY...

For dinner we both ordered the Virginia Spots done English Style. Virginia spots is a sweet, delicate fish. Not readily available in other parts of the country - to small and labor intensive. Leiostomus Xanthurus - Spot. They pan fry with flavored panko bread crumbs on top and a very delicate lemon cream sauce. This with the pasta of the day (bowties) is an awesome meal at any time. Never fishy or tough - delicate.

I really like there veal romano or crepe manicotti... Judee loves their veal saltimboca, they also make a chicken version - both are very good.

Another dish which they no longer have on the menu is the Mafalda Pasta - a wider noodle with a sauce to die for...

Do yourself a favor and stop here to eat."}
{"text":"Yikes.  If you're looking for an exciting meal where you are assaulted verbally and physically, I recommend you try this place.  Although the food is run of the mill Italian, the attitude of the owner (mimicked of course by at least some of the staff) takes this to a whole other level. He is rude, frightening, and shameful.  Be careful.  When we used to live in the Burgh we tried this place at the rave reviews of neighbors.  Many locals swear by this place. We thought the food was good (not great or stellar) and the service was abrupt but ok. On returning recently for a conference, a group dinner with colleagues was overpriced and turned disgraceful by horrid behavior from the owner.  I only wished we still lived in the area so I could warn unsuspecting neighbors."}
{"text":"This place is soo so good- Old school Italian that never disappoints. I've had their pastas, seafood, and ravioli, which is a specialty of theirs apparently.... and everything is always delish! Their Virginia spots is my mother's favorite, definitely recommended with the lump crabmeat add-on. I especially love that entrees are served with a small side of pasta. The dining room is cozy and quiet, but not weird quiet, and staff is super friendly and welcoming. They also have lots of prepared foods and frozen ravioli available to purchase."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs in the South Hills for Italian. Dave DeLallo and his staff have a first class neighborhood restaurant. The food is always good and the staff is friendly, perhaps a bit too chummy. Favorites include the spots with crab meat, veal piccata, lasagna. You can't go wrong here. Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"We visited last night for dinner. We ordered the bruschetta and mozzarella sticks. Both were very good. We ordered the lasagna, the prime rib, the spots and penne with marinara. As a vegetarian, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of options. The online menu lists pizza, but when we arrived, the menu didn't have pizza. I was disappointed that the noodles with my marinara sauce weren't al dente, but were on the mushy side. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. We all enjoyed pecan balls for dessert. The service was really good. The crowd is a bit older, but we actually appreciated that it was quiet and we could hear and converse with one another. 

I hope they update their online menu soon and I'd love to see more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian cuisine! Love their red clam sauce with mussels, best I ever had. Pasta Scoglio (seafood) is delish! Excellent attentive service, good portions and reasonable prices. Make a reservation the place is busy!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. But it's my first time eating ravioli. Sharon recommend me to eat cheese and meat. I like meat better. I'll come back for the lobster ravioli. I really like it here the environment is nice.Sharon the bartender/waitress it's very friendly. She make me feel comfortable, and I felt very relaxed when I'm there enjoying my dinner. She's the best waitress."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday evening. Would recommend reservations, because it is quite busy. Their menu consists of classic Italian dishes for reasonable prices. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, because I had it before and remember it being wonderful. It came with either soup or salad. My friend ordered the prime rib. 

After bread and salad, the eggplant parm came out. It was steaming hot with a layer of melted cheese on top. Their eggplant parm is amazing because it is layers of breaded eggplant, their homemade sauce, and small bits of italian sausage. The eggplant is not too thick and there is not too much breading. Their sauce is also wonderful. It is a hearty portion. The prime rib was also huge and cooked well. For desert, I had the tiramisu. It was very good, but a bit bitter for my liking."}
{"text":"Seriously good food.  Yum.  Awesome service ... Try the special ... You'll love it... 
I would not consider it two $$- more like $$$"}
{"text":"This is one of our 'go to' places. Lots of restaurants say they have great 'Spots'. I like Spots. So, I've gotten them at a number of places. None come close to the quality of the one's here. Delicious! I usually get them with crabmeat. 
The wait staff is friendly, and experienced. We loved the Bruschetto, zucchini and crab cake appetizers. Any of the pasta meals are delicious.
We brought our future son-in-law's parents here for our meet and greet dinner. They are from out of town. They were so impressed with the food that they arranged for the Rehersal Dinner to be held there. Enough said. DeLallo's does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this very popular staple near South Hills Village. I arrived when it opened at 11 am and was given the choice to either in the main room or the lounge. I choose the main room and sat down at a booth.

I was immediately served and shown the specials of the day. With today being Ash Wednesday those specials were all seafood related. I opted for the salmon salad and since I had heard so much about their wedding soup requested a cup. I got both my soup with a nice bread roll and crackers in no time flat. The soup was out of this world good! I highly recommend it if you are coming to visit.

My waitress was gracious and very attending to my needs. While I was only halfway done with my soup my salmon salad was ready. It too was good except I felt that they have over-drenched it in Italian dressing. Still it did not stop me from enjoying my salad. It was one of the Lenten specials so there is no guarantee I would see it again next time I visit.

They specialize in both Italian and seafood dishes but they also have burgers,salads, sandwiches and pizza along with full course  meals. Take out is also available if you want to phone ahead or just pick up something on your way out the door. I noticed among those take out items was biscotti. Looked good but I was too full from my meal to buy any.

Speaking of desserts I was shown a dessert menu but it does not list prices on it. Among the offerings was my favorite strawberry shortcake. I learned that all cake desserts are $7.00. If you prefer ice cream you are paying about $2.75 or if you want pecan ball for $3.75. Believe me it was tempting but I was stuffed from my soup, bread, and salad that I decided to pass.

I also noticed that there is a plate charge if you decide you want to split your meal with someone. It is best to get here early because this place gets packed fairly quickly. It is located on Fort Couch Road if you are approaching South Hills Village from Bethel Church road. A definite return to check out some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Another reason I miss living in Scott Township, being able to come here on a whim. It's been around since I was a kid and a South Hills mainstay.
Shopping at the mall always means lunch or dinner.
Ravioli and wedding soup are authentic and remind me of my Nana's kitchen. 
If you order the chicken Parmesan I suggest getting it to share with someone else because the meal is huge enough to share and still take some home.
Salads are my lunch favorites. Lettuce is crisp and all the veggies are fresh."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! Who goes to an Italian restaurant and orders prime rib? We do! It was DELISH! Very tender and flavorful! Totally worth coming back for! Okay, now for Italian food. The lasagna was pretty much the BEST that we've ever had. It was definitely a legit homemade recipe and very fresh! Layers and layers of amazing flavor! If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We tried DeLallo's for the first time tonight even thought we have lived in the South Hills our entire lives. Had no idea it was so close to home! Tonight happened to be our 3 year anniversary and also happened to be a week since my gallbladder surgery haha. I had broiled spots which I figured was a safe choice to eat and sounded delicious, while my boyfriend had the chicken. They were both delicious and we both agreed that the \"spots\" was probably the best fish we have ever had! Yum! I will definitely be going back to get more. We also both had the wedding soup which was also very delicious. It was a Wednesday night and not super busy, but it seemed to take a while to even get our order taken, so that is my only complaint. Other than that the food was excellent and staff was very friendly. We will be back again for sure. I would love to try their dessert next time because I heard it is great as well."}
{"text":"Stayed at Crown Plaza - this is a must try. Italian hubby loved the lasagna & tender meat balls. Sauce was so good. Homemade Cheese raviol were great! Even the side salad with the balsamic dressing was so tasty. A Sunday night & waiting list was an hour. Glad we found 2 seats at bar & got in & out. A definite re visit on our Chicago DC trips."}
{"text":"It's fun to visit a new city and find a classic like DeLallo's!   We entered on a bustling Friday night at about 8:00pm and were quickly seated though the restaurant was still quite full.  Our waitress was a petite women who you could tell had been here for years!  What a treasure!

We began with a bottle of Chianti and the stuffed peppers with a plentiful basket of bread (the 'salt sticks' were a big hit). The peppers were really spicy and we found out later that the sausage is make in house.  Excellent start to the meal.

Next came salads, crispy, with house made Caesar and Italian dressings.  

For our main courses, Schweety stayed traditional and enjoyed a large bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and I went for the veal Saltimbuca.  Four thin cutlets seared in thick prosciutto. 

Overall we enjoyed our visit and would come here again if in the area."}
