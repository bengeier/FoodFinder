{"text":"One thing you should take into consideration before going in...1.) This place is located across the street from the abandoned Festival Mall. 2.) Sit in the parking garage lot and watch the clientele that enters. Yeah. So, one the hostess was terrible and rude. Did not greet us. We walked the buffet line. Very odd dishes to say the least and disorganized in the way it was presented. I wish I could have taken pictures. Tacos next to soup next to crab legs. We sit down at a table and look up--spider webs, dust, table was terrible sticky. Think of the worst episode of kitchen nightmares and times that by 7. Food was the most store bought garbage. I've definitely had the same spring rolls in a sample station at Costco. At least those were warm. So unless your into taking risks and eating sketchy chinese/ taco/ store bought macaroons would not recommend."}
{"text":"I literally laughed out loud when I was told how much I had to pay for what was obviously store bought food. Very mediocre, very unclean.. just go to Costco and get some frozen orange chicken, it's better."}
{"text":"Still good tho it may need more improvement in time but still good food and alright services."}
{"text":"We happened to be passing by when we saw Hibachi Grill. Thinking it was teppan style, we decided to check it. We were surprised to see that it was an all you can eat buffet (Chinese; sushi; Mongolian grill; seafood - crab legs, crab, oysters, clam, shrimp, mussels; salad, dimsum, american , and dessert bar (with blue bunny ice cream).  The place is big and kid friendly. It's casual so I don't have to worry what I am wearing. My family enjoyed it because of the variety of selection.  Compared to other Chinese buffet, this place has a lot of food to chose from and the price is very reasonable. Because of that, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Average place. The food is diverse and edible. Some of the food is a little cold, but still an enjoyable place for friends.   The food and service is what you would expect from a Chinese buffet - okay but not great.   The hibachi grill is the best feature and is always enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. The first time my brother got food poisoning; the second time, my dad and I got food poisoning. I really enjoyed the food, but my stomach didn't agree. Maybe it was cooked wrong or the sea food was bad, either way I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to try this place out for lunch yesterday. Its a nice place with a big selection of food and it's all good. Until you get hair in 2 out of the 3 plates you get. Completely disgusting. We stopped eating after finding the black hair. After we got home, I got food poisoning from their food! It was the only thing I ate that day and my boyfriend had different foods from me. I was sick for 5 hours. Terrible experience. Never again will we go back to this horrid place!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this buffet, but it satisfies a craving if you are running low on $$$ Food is good, desserts are good too.  Cons- how the staff just goes ahead and gives you the fortune cookies and your bill after like half an hour, makes me feel like Im getting kicked out...."}
{"text":"Went here on our first night of vacation in Phoenix out of desperation for something quick that we thought the kids would like. We were starving after a 5 hour flight.  The food sucked. It was bland, at best. I was actually concerned about how there were only a handful of tables occupied on a Saturday night. And I was concerned about not getting sick the next day.   Didn't get sick but wouldn't ever go back or recommend. Should have gone down the road to Red Lobster. Lol"}
{"text":"OMG, please avoid this place unless you're a fan of mediocre food.  The Mongolian grill area spells of spoiled food.  Most of the food is lukewarm probably from a lack of customers, so the food turnaround doesn't happen as often.  I tried the sushi and the tuna roll tasted like it was canned tuna that they added pink food coloring to.  It definitely wasn't raw.  I will say the orange chicken sauce was good, but it had been sitting so long the chicken was soggy.  They have a big variety of food too, but the quality is low and the taste not great.  The pork and shrimp dumpling had a good flavor, but something tells me they don't make it here.  This place does not beat Panda Express and so I say save your money and go to Panda instead this place.  Pacific Buffet is heads and shoulders above this place."}
{"text":"Reading all the poor reviews prior to going tonight didn't detour me from my recent visit to Hibachi. The amount of food presented was incredible. The sushi rolls were great and the well kept stock of hot plates were filled with everything you could imagine. The place was busy and so was the food. We were still seated very fast and plates were picked up quickly.     Dinner tonight was 9.99, soda/tea was extra. They catered to everyone's taste including kids and those who don't always prefer Asian cuisine. I'm sorry for those who stated they were not impressed and could not have anything more to complain about other than take pictures of dirty restrooms to which my only response to that would be, try it again...it was grand opening week that you went and I'm sure the kinks have been resolved.     See you soon Hibachi!"}
{"text":"We came in for Father's day and it's 115 degrees outside. Inside the restaurant it's currently 86 degrees. Our baby is sweating and the hostess in the front desk is very rude from the moment we walked in. The server got our drinks wrong and when we asked if the a/c was working the server said yes but there's people so that's why it's hot. We can see the A/C control at 86 degrees. It is not worth paying $15 a person to come to a place with horrible service like this. Highly don't recommend it."}
{"text":"If it was at all possible I would give this establishment a 0 star rating. I had such high hopes for this buffet when it first emerged, and I have never been so disappointed by a buffet in years.   The moment we walked in, the restaurant was very humid and hot. The floors were littered with old food neglected to be cleaned or picked up. The whole place smelt like wet hot seafood. We were sat immediately which was nice.  The first unfortunate turn-off I ran into was the first few plates I picked up and examined were VERY dirty, and I had to go through quite a few to find one clean. That alone made me want to walk out the door, but determined to give this place a chance, we overlooked it.  The sushi at the Sushi station looked very old, much of it we tried was warm as if it had been sitting out for a while. The chicken and various common meat dishes all tasted as if they were made from pre-packaged frozen bases. The Low-mein and Chow-mein both tasted rubbery, bland and overcooked.   Everything was either overcooked or under-cooked. This was the first time I actually spat food back into a napkin! Having been turned off by everything else, I finally saw my favorite: Cream Cheese Wantons; My last hope.  One bite was enough to convince me it was time to leave.  It tasted soggy and spoiled.   Already feeling sick, we promptly cleaned our spots, neatly stacked our plates and proceeded to pay our bill at the front where the girl charged us 25.00 for the two of us and tossed my receipt at me. That was the icing on the cake.  This was our first and last time eating here.  We really wanted to give it a chance and it failed us.   Please, Don't make the same mistake we did."}
{"text":"started going here about 3 months ago. Every Wednesday between 11-6pm. always take out. Sophie usually works the front desk/register area! Super friendly! we know her by name as we always do take out.  the rest of the staff is starting to remember us as regulars even if we have not had much interaction with them. big smiles welcome back, good to see you again, even wave across the room when they see us! we have also stopped with our daughter and grandson on different days at different times. not once have we witnessed any mess at any of the buffet areas. children all seem to be under control. our food is always hot . my daughter is a picky sushi eater, she loves their sushi. we are quite confused as to the negitives about messy stations, cold food. we have watched people leave after they are done eating and noticed their tables are almost instantly cleared and cleaned.  we have been there different days, different times, Wednesday our main day and yet never witnessed anything of the complaints others listed. very delightful place/great food/ great staff!  we enjoy Hibachi!  super job to the entire staff and especially our Sophie!  Happy thoughts!"}
{"text":"I actually like this buffet a lot.  I've even been there on my birthday so that tells you how much I like it.  Not everything is perfect, but the food is good and fresh.  I like the sushi bar that has a ton of variety.  The ingredients are always fresh.  I've eaten there several times, during lunch, dinner, and between and that's when you really know how good a job someone is doing.  The food is still great at 3:30 in the afternoon.  The staff is always nice, but very quiet.  Not a lot of conversation goes one, but they smile a lot and wait on you very well.  I've taken my tablet and attended business webinars while there so was there for over 2 hours and the staff was STILL attentive.    It's one of the bigger buffets I've seen with several rows of food.  They have a great dessert area with different kinds of yummy ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. 5 or 6 rows of food (cant remember there were so many). Sushi bar and grill. selection seems endless. Very good service, too. Waiters comes around often to check on you. 6.99 lunch, and 9.99 dinner and weekends."}
{"text":"Because the word \"HIBACHI\", I was expecting a good old Japanese wooden brazier and hot, savory chargrilled food.    There was, however, nothing about Japanese except for a table soy sauce bottle. And the food was awful - both presentation and taste.  Stale, greasy, soggy, bland - you name it.  The worst buffet ever.  Interior decoration was in complete chaos and I doubt that they even care. Night club like multi-color changing lights were very distracting for lunch time.  The only \"SUPER\" thing was that there's a vast selection of bad taste food including Chinese, Mexican and American.  The overall service was just mediocre."}
{"text":"We wanted to give this place a second chance. But as soon as we got there we used the restroom and had to complain to the manager how disgusting the bathroom was. This should of gave us a sign of what's to come.  We noticed the food was water down especially the wasabi. I have never seen watery wasabi for the warm sushi rolls. When we left after paying out bill, we told the manager that we would not come back and as soon as I turned my back to leave out the door, he made a comment which we could not translate.  It was so bad that I had to create an account on Yelp to warn our community about this restaurant.  We even stopped at McDonald's on the way home since my family did not want to eat very much there."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Worst. buffet. ever. No A/C and staff is rude!"}
{"text":"Lackluster food even for a buffet. I recommend China Wok or Golden Corral if you are looking for a buffet experience. 10/10 would not go again.  Byeeee"}
{"text":"We went again for dinner per hubby's request and boy was it a different experience. Contrary to the first day the parking lot was filled and we had to wait in line for about 15 mins. Once seated we could see that the it was a crazy mess in there. The servers and workers in general looked overwhelmed, which you could tell from the dirty table and floors and there was a lack of consistency in the food quality . The floor had food, trash, and even a fork just lying around the entire time we were there and the food stations were absolutely filthy! Seriously, wipe down the food counters because its unsanitary and just disgusting to see counter-tops with food and sauces all over them.  There was also an issue with quality control because the orange chicken did not taste the same as the other day. This time the orange chicken was on the dry side and they were stingy with the sauce to the point where it could have been popcorn chicken because you couldn't really taste the sauce. There were other dishes that lacked quality control like the soups and shrimp, but the biggest problem was definitely how filthy the place was.  I get it, its still opening week and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt , but seriously it was just that dirty in there."}
{"text":"I'll start on a positive note. They have improved, from when they first opened.  :) The food is better now and the \"grill\" bar is a big plus. However they will not get anymore business from me, after my last visit. My concern is not with the food, but rather with the management. Their mistake was simple. However it's how they handled it, that got me and ultimately ruined the dining experience.   So here it is, in a nut shell..... They waited until AFTER I had my meal and AFTER they brought the check, to let me know that their machine was down and they couldn't take credit/debit.  So I needed to pay cash.  Guess what? Like many people these days, I live by the debit card  and seldom carry more than a few dollars. I asked if it was an intermittent issue. In which case I was happy to wait, until the machine was working, to run the card. Nope..will be down until tomorrow.  Now I'm NOT trying to get a free meal.  However the \"proper\" customer service thing to do, is comp the meal, because the issue was on their end, not mine.  I had singles for tip and would have been more generous on the next visit.  What I got was \"sorry\" and a blank stare..... after asking two more times how they want to handle it and getting the same  \"sorry\" and a blank stare,  I offered to go to an nearby ATM and get cash.  That was ok with them, but they wanted collateral to ensure my return.  So I left collateral, drove to an atm (paid $3 atm) and returned to pay the bill.  THEN I got \"thank you goodnight\" without returning my collateral.  So I politely asked for its return. Result... meal ruined, added cost of three whole dollars (hey that a gallon of milk) and not feeling appreciated/trusted as a customer. Plus I will not give them repeat business.  This could have all been avoided in 60 seconds, the moment I walked in....  \"Our machine broken. You pay cash?\" ....  ME: \"No, thank you. Bye bye.\"  I know many people would have pitched a fit, to get the meal comped (some, just because they had a good reason). Not my style, I save my tantrums for when I want toys. ;) I made sure they got their money,  but I will also make sure they do not get another dime from me.  There are too many other places in town with better food and better service,  than to risk going through that again.   \"Focker... out\" (Meet the Fockers)"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were attracted to this location because the price was not too bad for a buffet. This is about the only reason I am giving it 2 stars. All the food looked/tasted very dry and old even for it being not to late in the day. Never thought that I would see the day with a Chinese buffet would have tacos, if I would even call them that.  Not all was bad, the orange chicken and the \"sushi\" was ok. Just not worth it, not coming back. :("}
{"text":"I went here today with my fiancée since our first visit was great. The food was awesome......the first time. However, our second visit was very disappointing. I don't know if they fired all the good cooks but it was terrible. We had decided to go there for crab legs but unfortunately gotten something that tasted very dry and smelled funky and had green residue. We were excited at first when the waitress placed the plate of crab legs before us but after, ruined our appetites as she reached in and grabbed a crab leg and said \"is this mines\"...I was like thinking WTF!!! your hands better be clean. But I highly doubt that because right before we entered she was on her phone. Anybody in the food industry know, phones carry allot of germs that we don't see. This is the last time we are going there. And the last thing...the minute I walked out the door, I gotten a stomach ache. That wasn't nice at all. This place definitely needs Chef Ramsey's kitchen rescue or refresh the staff in food safety."}
{"text":"$9.99 for dinner and even on the weekends is freaken awesome!!! Ok so this buffet doesn't have the typical crab legs and the sushi isn't all that great but their price is well worth it for their dishes.  The Asian dishes they have here look like normal buffet dishes but they are so much better! Everything tastes really good when u eat it.  They even have raw oysters here which I love! Before when I went here, their shrimp cocktail was peeled but now they have a different shrimp cocktail that has the skin on and looks a bit different. I liked the old shrimp better. Their sushi isn't authentic and you can tell its been sitting out for a while. I usually don't eat much of it.  The service is great though and they're very attentive. I like coming to this buffet often because dinner is only ten bucks and it includes great dishes, raw oysters, and crawfish which is worth it to me. They also have great low mien and american BBQ ribs that I like.  The reason I give it 4 stars is because I always have to ask them to refill some of their trays but that's the only down side. Everyone should eat here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is filthy. Food is decent. But the bathrooms had feces on the walls. The place is so humid they have fans everywhere to help and it doesnt. Food from past visitors are alwaus left behind. They mop the floor with the same feces smelling mop they probably use for the bathroom. Sooooo horrible."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised how good the selection of food was for the price of $10 on sunday. Can't beat that price for what you get here.. They have the mongolian grill where they cook your noodle fresh and you can put whatever meat and veggies you want."}
{"text":"The food isn't half bad but I must say one rotten attitude from one associate can really spoil it for the whole team. Our waitress was very nice but the sitting hostess not very pleasant and not to mention the guy making sushi. So I went up to get sushi and there was a lady already there getting hers to go. She asked the sushi guy what the white noodle stuffs on the sushi were and he brushed her off. As I always say if u don't want to do the work or don't need the job then get out. People like to eat in a pleasant place and that means the one who preps and cooks the food needs to love what they do cause that's what makes the food enjoyable. I will not go there ever again."}
{"text":"Very rude waitress, dirty, musty, place. Floors need extreme cleaning and not to mention all the grimey items on the table (napkins, soy sauce bottle etc.) do not spend your time and money at this place!! You're better off going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Sushi bar was good, but I currently live in California so I'm use to the fish being a little more fresh l.Some of the food was a little  warm...Stick to the popular selections, well with 10.99 for dinner."}
{"text":"If I could leave less than 1 star, I would. I would leave negative stars. I have given them 3 tries, each time, staff very rude, some food cold and congealed, and the last and final time, foreign object in food, which they seemed not at all concerned about. Save your money."}
{"text":"It's close to our home and the food is generally pretty good. I like the sushi and the orange chicken the best. the only thing I don't like about the place is most of the staff is not very friendly and the prices seem to be going up a little more each time we go in."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting I would take stars from it if I could! Dirty sticky tables, sticky floor that hasn't been mopped in days. Rude angry confused \"waitstaff\" who cannot properly refill a drink.  The food was horrific. Either no seasoning or hot seafood dishes served Luke warm to cold. Coconut Shrimp a gelatinous mess cold and pasty. We tried several dishes each and gave up going to the grill thinking at least that would be hot. The man cooking at the grill spoke little if any English and pointed to the three types of sauce written on a dirty glass sneeze cover like a mad man. \"Choose!\" Grill is not cleaned well between patrons so choosing a sauce does not matter. Teriyaki sauce was watered down and did not season or coat the meat and vegetables he was angrily beating into the consistency of dog food. Just under $30 for two people and we both are feeling ill after leaving 45 minutes ago. Too late to induce vomiting so add a large bottle of Pesto to the cost. Someone needs to call the health department. Do not go unless you are trying to take your worst enemy and exact revenge!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant experience I have had in my life! The host is sat us and the waitress took our drink order. I have a three year old who doesn't drink her own dink even if we do get her one. So I decided I was only getting my drink and she was going to drink from my drink. The waitress went to go get the hostess and they began talking in there language. I assume it was about us because shortly the hostess approached us and stated \"I have to charge you for another dink because you guys are not allowed to share\" she was very rude about it so I said ok get her a drink. They continued to chat and look our way, so I decided to check my daughter's drink. Only to find a strange foam floating on top. It's disgusting that they would do it period but to a child's dink that just a different level.  I asked to speak to the manager and the hostess went to the back and come back up and stated the manager was too busy to speak with me. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!! i"}
{"text":"Tuesday, January 20, 2015 visit:  Let's get to the point. With ample parking and a decent/accessible location this place has a good selection of dishes to satisfy just about anyone in your party. The quality and presentation are definitely above par for buffets in the valley (considering the price) and I have no complaints about the atmosphere or cleanliness (no loud music, funky smells, dirty floors/booths, ...etc.). Raw oysters on a half shell, salt and pepper crab, at least four varieties of shrimp, nigiri sushi (salmon and yellowtail that melt in your mouth), tekamaki sushi (several varieties), kimchee, seaweed salad (sweet/not fishy), orange chicken (done crispy the way it should be), baked salmon, clams in the shell, sunomono (japanese style cucumber salad), beef short ribs (well done/lightly sauced), fresh sliced (not from the can) strawberries, oranges, cantaloupe, and pineapple, various desserts/ice cream, and a whole lot more. The waiter was very friendly and kept our table picked up and drinks filled. He did not make us feel rushed by bringing the check too soon. All in all this was a good experience and the wife and I will surely be back..."}
{"text":"The nastiest food I have tasted to date in Arizona. So now I have to sit here and wait for everyone else to get done eating so I can go grab me something to eat. This is some nasty shit. They don't make fresh food after 6pm obviously. So I will be paying for a beverage ONLY."}
{"text":"I warn you, do not go here unless you would like to be treated like scum.   Whoever the owner is of this restaurant I would like them to contact me so we can speak regarding the way we were treated when we came here.  It is really unfortunate because the food was not bad for the price.    First of all the hostess told us to hurry up when she was seating us. It was totally unprofessional.   Then, when we we got up to go to the middle desk to pay, the waitress blocked me from walking towards the desk and told me I had to pay her now. I asked her why I couldn't pay at the desk, and she said no you pay me now, and continued to block me.   After she brought back the receipt, she hovered over me as I filled it out and stated \"you leave tip! Look at your mess!\"   Mind you we definitely had no mess, we even stacked our plates and napkins into one pile so it was easier to bus.   After that I was greatly offended and disrespected. I did not leave any tip, and of course with her hovering over, she got upset and started yelling.    I tried to talk to a manager or store owner, however, apparently everyone there is the \"manager\".   I asked to contact the owner and they said \"he's not here too bad\".    Unprofessional, unkind, and disrespectful service."}
{"text":"Food was very very very low quality, they didn't put more food out of their popular dishes, and the absolute WORST part was the waitress INTERRUPTING ME AND A FRIEND MID CONVERSATION and then coming up to me AFTER PAYING FOR THE FOOD asking for me to sign the receipt. After telling her I would take care of her/it she continued to nod her head and stand there staring FORCING me to tip her while I still had a full plate of food. I don't leave reviews but this was the worse waitress experience I have ever experienced followed by bad food."}
{"text":"Egads! We have been waiting for a good time to try Hibachi Grill Super Buffet, hoping to experience a new and tasty oriental buffet. We walked in tonight and were amazed at the huge number of buffet tables, Wow I though this is going to be good...  Problem is that this is not an oriental buffet. It is a buffet with some oriental style food like products displayed upon luke warm to cool buffet tables. Nothing, not one single thing had the look, feel or flavour of real food.  I know that buffet restaurants are designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but this place is working hard at reaching a new low and it's not even very inexpensive; 2 dinners and 2 sodas was $27.00!!! For this sort of money I can find real food all over this valley.  Do your self a favour, eat someplace else.  (Oh by the way; in Arizona in the middle of summer a restaurant really needs to have AIR CONDITIONING!! Not big groups of fans! Hibatchi Grill Super Buffet is NOT worth your time or money.)"}
{"text":"When experiencing a new buffet, I put a bite of each promising thing on my plate, then return for more of what I like, so as to take only what I know I will eat. I'll just give you my notable points, since I'm not a huge fan and there's no WOW factor, but there were a few interesting redeeming points above the mediocrity. - Many Mexi-centric items due to the neighborhood demographic. - Sushi area and stir fry area. Good representative items but not WOW. - 2 kinds of ceviche, small octopus and shrimp. - Build your own taco! Screw you Taco Bell, I'm piling on the cheese WELL BEYOND your little cupcake sprinkles you call cheese, and I'm adding more than your requisite four tomato bits. No sour cream / crema that I could see though. Maybe it's somewhere else and I missed it. - Stuffed crab shells are fun and yummy. However be careful as the shell is thin and you don't want bits in your mouth. - There were these little bread things with artichoke dip topping that were good! - Peel n eat shrimp are decent size. - Peel n eat crawdads were OK, a little grey but good size. - Chicken wings were totally BLAH. PLAIN. - Oysters. I tried one and didn't like it. They're large but tasted weird and I spat it out. Maybe YOU try it. I've had oysters of a different shape before somewhere else and they tasted better. - Chicken stuffed mushrooms were delicious. - Teriyaki beef with mushroom was kinda good but not WOW. - Teriyaki chicken was standard good. - There was duck meat but it was kinda blah. My German mother cooks better duck. Watch out for bones, be careful. - Cheese wontons dunked in sweet n sour sauce are a guilty indulgence of mine and this place didn't disappoint. - Lots of fresh fruit and dessert things! LYCHEE FRUIT! I was amazed and had some with my ice cream.  Plate take away was prompt but not my water refill. I think they charge for soda not water. Weekends is full dinner price - mine came out to $11.50 or so total, but you get EVERYTHING.   Bottom line - I won't be back, I'd rather go to Lin's for the money! However this could be the best buffet in Mesa."}
{"text":"The price is worth what you can get, I'm not sure why the ratings are so low. The staff was nice and brief and refilled drinks in a timely manner. The selection of food is pretty good from sushi to seafood to chicken to steamed buns. Overall pretty nice buffet for its price. Only complaint is my table and silverware was dirty."}
{"text":"Great place and awesome food but my one complain is that i think the hostess and cashier should be in dresser clothes not diets and a top that says bamm"}
{"text":"I went this morning with my husband for lunch and it was really good and clean  loved it a whole lot of food"}
{"text":"Aweful! Stay clear. The floors are sticky, under the tables had old food caked on the legs and floor, the staff is unfriendly, I can go on and on... and whatever you do - DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM!"}
{"text":"Immediately as I walked in the AC was on, I noticed new tables, and waitresses with uniforms greeting my cousin and I! As I looked around, the restaurant was brighter and cleaner. The food was fresh and hot! My suspicions were correct that Hibachi Grill is under new ownership! So impressed :) Good job Hibachi!"}
{"text":"NASTY Raw Beef on the buffet. See picture of RAW MONGOLIAN BEEF. Not just red but also the raw jelly like texture."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were not impressed. The floors were sticky. The tables were barely clean and the food was eh. The staff wasn't that friendly either. I know I won't be returning. And I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. My daughter is 9 so she was supposed to get the kids price. They said she was too tall to get the kids price and charged her as an adult. They refused to believe she was a child. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was very disappointing. There was absolutely no seasoning. The atmosphere was not welcoming at all. Half of the food I was scared to eat."}
{"text":"We went back to Hibachi Grill Super Buffet this afternoon for a second time to give it another try. We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering this time. I didn't see any of the messes on the floors, tables, or buffets that people mentioned in other reviews. Everything looked clean, and the wait staff were there to clean off our empty plates and refill our glasses. The food is typical buffet food - nothing fancy or especially delicious, just standard. As a vegetarian, I had the vegetable lo mein, some cucumbers/tomatoes and mushoom salad. Very tasty. I don't know what all my husband ate, but he ate a lot and said it was good. I also didn't see any small children running around sticking hands in the buffet this time. My husband says all buffet tables should be taller so kids can't play in the food haha! This second experience was much better than the first, so I upped my rating from one star to three."}
{"text":"Well another Hibachi in the Valley (I love them all) .Arlin B. and Rand H.joined me here for lunch and with well over 100 trays of food there was lots to eat. Most of the food was real good so I say to myself why are you only giving this one 4 stars? Well it was missing a few of my favorite dishes ,fresh strawberries, and the tacky fountain. So yes YAY!! I Am a fan.The more Hibachi's the better."}
{"text":"Red Bean Sticky Rice cake wrapped in tea leaf and steamed was AMAZING!!! Although it tastes slightly sweet and like a dessert, it is not located by the desserts; you will find it in the dumpling area.  I've never had anything like it. It tastes like super sticky rice, and Hawaiian poi in the center with a tiny amount of sugar. The texture is great. I wish I could just go there to eat only that. 5/5 for the steamed red bean sticky rice cake!  In my honest opinion, the rest of the buffet had a very large variety but did not taste that great. The meat and seafood wasn't great quality and wasn't as flavorful as expected. 2/5 for the sushi and Chinese food.   I paid about $13 for lunch buffet which includes large crab and seafood area, and a large variety of ribs and meat. They also give you a good sized portion of ice cream in individual containers.   Great price, pretty good value. I'm contemplated if I should pay $13 next weekend to only eat red bean stick rice cakes"}
{"text":"When we entered it was stuffy! The girls we very friendly! Food was okay... Some stuff you can tell tasted old!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of tasty foods. Pretty much anything you would want seafood, pizza, Chinese food, Mexican food, nice salad bar and sushi made fresh. Lots of tasty desserts to choose from. Awesome value."}
{"text":"Starting with price. Average for a buffet. There are some cultural dishes here that we did not try such as steamed chicken feet.  They also have a large variety of mainstream dishes from various cultures such as enchiladas, sushi, sweet and sour chicken ect.  They have a nice hibachi grill with some good choices.   The drawbacks. Some of the less chosen food was a little dry and probably cooler than it should be. The ice cream was generic in a styrofoam like in school."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's a buffet, with tons of variety. Tacos, soups, pizza, fried rice, chicken wings, sushi, salads, fish, chow mein, vegetables, cakes, jello, ice cream, and a hibachi station!   I come here just for the hibachi station! Create your own plate! Yum!   On this day, my server seemed to forget about my table and our dirty plates started to pile up! For the most part though, they stay on top of the refills and the plates.   The dining area is huge here!! There are tons of tables and they are all spread out.   The restaurant itself has a humid vibe to it. (If that's a thing) The air feels really muggy and sticky especially where the food is at. At one point, I was feeling a little hot and sweaty (yuck) while I was eating. I'm not sure if they even had the AC on....   Prices and food vary throughout the day and on the weekends!"}
{"text":"First of all, entering the place wasn't at all the feeling of cozy, heartwarming dining experience. More like running cattle through a chute waiting for a feeding.  We were walked over to a table which hadn't been cleaned yet. Of all the tables that were empty she set us up with one that had two wet wash clothes and a broom and dust pan prompt against our seats. I said the seating wasn't acceptable but she said it would be gone after we got our food.  It wasn't. We got our ice tea after a while and when asked to have it refilled the waitress rolled her eyes and stumbled around like a toddler who just didn't want to do this any more.  The food was acceptable but after watching the staff refill the food trays and throw old food that had fallen out back into the new trays, I came to the conclusion everybody was doing the same. I seen small kids by themselves doing the same thing. Food wasn't very hot. I seen no steam rising when the staff changed trays. Most of the utensils were sticky.  The floors were really dirty and I noticed everything on our table was sticky including the back of the seats."}
{"text":"Service was good- so it justifies the one star but the food, what you go there for, is not good. Not good at all. Nothing in particular wrong just not a good variety of items for a buffet, in my opinion, I just have been to a lot. I understand it's a buffet and it's not supposed to be of great quality, but there are much much better buffets for comparable prices not far from this one. They have a very below bar salad selection, ice cream in styrofoam cups (like summer camp), and even their grill was nothing to rave about. I'm really not one to complain, I just think people who are curious about if this place is good or not should know to not waste their money here."}
{"text":"I thought the selection of food was great and the hibachi was full of fresh vegetables. I enjoyed my meals there and would definitely go back because the food was amazing for the price."}
{"text":"My family likes to go to this place for the seafood. There is a lot of it and you can't beat the price for an all-you-can eat. I however, cannot eat seafood. The quality of food has gone down. The egg rolls were cold. I went to the fresh grill. I selected a variety of veggies. The chicken was raw  and not frozen. I am not sure it was held at the right temperature. I threw up everything I ate. The desserts were divine. My family ate several plates of seafood and none of them are sick. So I'd say if you want a lot of seafood, go here."}
{"text":"Not a great buffet but the best one (for the $) I've found since moving to the area. Better selection than any of the others around and very economical."}
{"text":"Best buffet I've had. Large selection and very yummy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Runners get ready, set, GO!  This is the second time I have been here since they opened. Friendly service and a Huge selection of items with all the extra things like pizza, tacos, chicken wings and then some if you are not in the mood for Chinese. They even one of those Mongolian things where they cook your dish to order included in the price. Nice!  Came here with some of the fun bunch Rand H., Robyn N. and Mike C. to enjoy some tasty vittles and a little jabber. We all enjoyed different aspects of this giant buffet. Each of us had different things on our plates as we came back to the table. It was fun and I was full when we left.  Great value for what you can eat without having to think about what to order. Just fill up your plate and go back as many times as you want. Hot sauces are also available to kick things up a notch if you wish.  Place gets really busy and recommend getting there before the massive crowd of flesh eating zombies bouncing around like an old Pachinko game arrive. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the boyfriend's favorite buffet because of the price and the seafood selection. At the far end, they have a dim sum area and carry red bean sticky rice - so yummy.  I haven't been to the bathrooms yet but the seating areas seem quite clean, compared to other Chinese buffets in the area.  My biggest gripe with Hibachi Grill is their dismal dessert section. It consists of: ice cream prescooped (vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, orange sherbert, rainbow sherbert, AND THAT'S IT), banana pudding, chocolate pudding, rice pudding, apple pie, donut holes (but larger), and little finger cake assortments like you can find from the grocery store.  To get a 5 stars from me, I would need:  1) at LEAST a soft serve ice cream machine. Like wtf? I thought this was a given for all buffets, but I guess not. I realize these machines take a lot of cleaning and effort to maintain (I used to work at Pinkberry) but like. Not offering a froyo or soft serve machine with a topping bar is maddening. Take some notes from Sweet Tomatoes,  please! Or literally any other buffet.  2) if not, then more ice cream flavors. Cookies n cream? Mint chip? Butter pecan? Seriously, the flavor selection they currently have is kind of super depressing.  Upgrade the dessert selection and this would be my favorite buffet, probably. In all honesty, adding a soft serve machine to their lineup would really convince me to join my boyfriend here for dinner wayyyy more often.  If you aren't a sugarholic and love these Chinese buffets, then this place is probably not going to disappoint. I like their dumplings and sio mai."}
{"text":"You just have to meet a certain minimum standard to get me in the door to a buffet, and this one didn't live up to it.  It has an old, tired feel to it and it doesn't reflect well on the food.  The restaurant had a kind of humidity to it which again just didn't make anything feel fresh.  The taste wasn't bad, the selection wasn't bad, they just need to do more with the presentation and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not bad overall.. a little dirty they need to clean the floors a little more often.. food isn't to bad! Service is average for a buffet place. The need to update a little.. prices aren't bad for what they have."}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if I could! Restaurant is FILTHY, even the plates have left over food on them! It is dark and humid inside, and crappy workers. And it always seems as if there is no manager to be seen, ever.   The main event was that my husband found metal in his food. METAL. That he had to pull out of his own mouth! It looked like two shards that came off some kitchen utensils. We demanded to talk to the manager, which as I said before, is suddenly out / busy, so they only offered 20% off.   Do not eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"Got an ad in our mail when we were living down the street. Thought we would stop in just to give it a try. It's a buffet with a selection of asian food along with some American dishes. They also had a few of seafood dishes which I really love. Came in here with my bf one day to check it out and see how the food tastes. I ended up getting sushi, oysters, stir fried chicken fried rice and egg noodle soup.  We also got some crawfish. I must say the sushi wasn't all that great, very dry I'm not impressed but then again its a buffet place not a sushi restaurant. The crawfish smelt bad and it tasted just as bad. Ended up throwing it to waste. But everything else was pretty good. Not a bad place to eat at."}
{"text":"A new Asian super buffet going in a vacant Black Angus Steakhouse? I'm there! There's got to be at  least one establishment open for business along Southern Avenue from Alma School to Longmore. For this review, I feel it will be best to list pros and cons about my experience on a recent Saturday evening...  Pros:  Attentive Hostess/Wait Staff; Unique Decor, Large selection of food choices available, separate price for children; real ice cream (as opposed to that frozen ice milk that most Asian buffets serve (wtf is that?)); Spacious floor plan to accomodate a large number of patrons as well as ease in navigating the different stations  Cons: Is the use of 3 different styles of chandeliers intentional? I kind of like consistency, otherwise it looks like you've outfitted your establishment from Goodwil finds.  Speaking of consistency ... If you're going to label SOME things, label EVERYthing. Most things I could figure out, but that makeshift taquito-looking thing looked like it was filled with Steak Tartare rather than taco meat. Which brings me to my next point. I've been to enough of these kinds of establishments and I've been a parent long enough to realize that sometimes there's picky eaters out there, children especially. So if you want to serve Pizza, I may find it a little out of place, but I can let it slide.    What I DON'T get, is the taco station, and the Tapatio hot sauce on the table. True, most Asian buffets are frequented by Hispanic families. I totally get that, believe me, but if an ASIAN establishment with a taco bar is walking a fine line. If it starts serving Horchatas and Tamarindo waters (like I've seen one do), then my natural instinct is to think that they've sold out, or they don't know what they're specializing in and when that happens, they run the risk of having their quality suffer. If Mexi-Chino Fusion is your goal, then brand yourselves as such. That's all I'm saying. Good night."}
{"text":"The service cost them a star! I don't know if they were understaffed or what...the dumplings were the best I have had and the coconut chicken was yummmm!!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"On our way to a sports store in Mesa, my friend and I decided to try this buffet which was just a few blocks from our final destination that noon. I like the other Hibachi grill buffets and this one was not a disappointment. It's a large buffet restaurant with a wide selection of dishes, mostly Asian including a sushi counter and a Mongolian grill. There are also a few non-Asian items such as tacos, pizza, platanos, and a salad bar. I also found items not commonly served in other buffets: these include simple fried fish (not breaded filets) and tom yum soup. I tried most of the items and all that I tried were good, with the exception of the sushi which was lackluster. In all, this was a very good dining deal: tasty food, lots of it, and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Under new management. They have variety of food now for a low price. They offer so many types of sushi and have three fish: yellowtail, tuna, and salmon."}
{"text":"Went here on a dark, rainy night and was one of the few customers inside. Nearly everything was disappointing, except for the hibachi grill, which was not worth the glares I received from the chef.  The temperature of the sushi seemed off and was way warmer than I felt it should be and the \"hot and sour\" soup was neither hot nor sour. I was honestly afraid to try much more than that."}
{"text":"Cold food. Tasteless! I need to put salt in most of the food. The price from m-f lunch $8.49 but dang the food is not soooo good. Look somewhere else"}
{"text":"Good place to go to grab a quick lunch with variety.  Typical American Chinese food, lots of soups, dumplings... Some items that are more unexpected...tacos, flautas, chicken wings, pizza (although this may be for the kiddos or kids at heart mostly). They also have sushi (I'm not a fan of buffet sushi) and a grill with it's own buffet of ingredients.   I like this place for an early lunch and I usually get the grill item after choosing a ton of veggies. I haven't been here for dinner and if you have a later lunch, there are a lot of kids here. I've had the chicken wings and they are yummy. A nice balance to my plate of grilled veggies hahah. The place is BIG and there is lots of parking. The staff is always nice and they constantly put fresh food out.   Good deal for a quick grilled no frills lunch on the run."}
{"text":"This place is one of the better cheap Chinese/Korean buffets.  One of the few places I have been where all the food seemed like it was made today and not leftovers from yesterday if you know what I mean.  Some of the dishes were actually interesting like the baby octopus with bell peppers and jalapeno peppers.  They had oysters on the half shell, while not freshly shelled they were tasty and in good condition. They standard whole fried shrimp were excellent compared to other Asian buffets.  The beef ribs were surprisingly tender even if they used bottled BBQ sauce, I like bottled BBQ sauce anyway.  The char shu flavored pork ribs were fresh and tasty too.  While none of the sushi wowed me, they were better than other buffets. For $12 with an ice tea, this place is priced right for me to return, especially after I work out and it is also close to my Fairfield Inn almost within walking distance."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ trying to find a New Goto Chinese Buffet. This is Not it. If you want to try for yourself I recommend getting it to go. They have a Large Variety but it is not kept up with Fresh food. Lots of Seafood very little options when it comes to Chicken or Beef. Two Adults with drinks almost $29.00. Now going to fast food drive thru to get something to eat."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to eat I went on a Friday on dinner time for two people there was no waiting time"}
{"text":"They've improved a lot since the last time I've been here. There's more options, and the food tastes better. Service is just okay and it's not the cleanest, but I feel like that's expected for a buffet in this price range. I had a good dinner for a good price so I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the buffet....Great variety of seafood and American and Asian cuisine. Staff is polite and courteous."}
{"text":"Decent dumplings/pot stickers.  Most of the \"hot\" food was lukewarm at best.  Sushi was decent and fresh.  Service was very good but food overall would have been 3 star buffet food if it was hot."}
{"text":"So so nasty.. Worst buffet ever, greasy, old sushi sitting there so long the rice was hard and crusty.. Nothing there of any quality.. There's a reason this place is always so cheap yet still empty inside."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch one day.  We were surprised at the large selection.  Everything we had was delicious.  The service was excellent.  They kept the table cleared and drinks filled.  We will definitely go back.."}
{"text":"It's okay. Service was good, but the food was hit and miss. Some stuff was really good like the salmon and the fried rice but I wasn't a fan most of the rest of the stuff I tried, but we did show up about 45 min before they closed so I guess it wasn't the freshest. My boyfriend liked it better than I did"}
{"text":"Usually buffets start out sparkling clean, and serving only the finest food. Smiling chefs, and pristine service usually declines after a year or so. This place just opened, and the food is already stale and bland. Sushi chef dogging you every time you walk by. Dirty floor and tables. They gave up from the start."}
{"text":"I attended the Grand Opening of Hibachi Buffet in Mesa, Arizona which started at 11am on March 29th, 2012. I was the third customer to enter the restaurant to try out its delicious luncheon buffet which had a wide variety of Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, Mexican and American dishes with delicious deserts . Me and my buddies were completely satisfied. The lunch cost $6.99 per person and dinner cost $9.99 a person.Adding Tea and sodas to your meal cost $1.49 each."}
{"text":"Welcoming and friendly staff. Mongolian grill to one side of the room and about 7 or 8 rows of steam tables or chilled salad or ice cream tables. Nicely decorated and well lit, with roomy aisles and both booths and tables. Everything was very clean. Parking is close to the door.  I tried the fried rice (very good), the orange chicken (about the same taste as PF Changs), spring rolls (perfectly done--not burnt like some places), crab roll, salad, cantaloupe, onion rings (excellent), and oreo cookie ice cream for desert. I took the fortune cookie with me since I was too full to eat it there. I will try the soups the next time I come. They also have some Mexican food and some pizza slices for the kids and there are many dessert options and fresh seafood options. Don't count on the labeling to be accurate. I took a spoonful of potatoes with cheese that turned out to be spinach and cheese (OK by me, it was tasty with a hint of garlic and probably healthier the the potatoes would have been). The only negative I can think of is they don't include a knife with the napkin and fork and soup spoon. I could have used the knife to cut my cantaloupe and chicken into smaller pieces. All for $6.99 for lunch. I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"My husband treated me here for a second time because we love it.   Just wanted to put down more delicious stuff that they have because the variety of food is remarkable: stuffed mushrooms, crabmeat, baked scallops, lobster, shrimp ceviche, teriyaki broccoli. On the American side, I did notice roasted duck, BQ ribs and buffalo wings.   This time, I had my helping of sushi, but with tofu and shrimp ceviche. It's as good as from any Mexican restaurant, if not better. I finished it off with green tea ice cream, which was soooo good."}
{"text":"the food here was nasty the service was bad and the girl i guess who was mgr. who had no name tag was rude. my brother told her 2 kids and 3 adults including myself and they charged him for an extra adult for my neice who is 10 gnna b 11 in feb. an extra 11.00 and then on top of that asked my brother r u her father what professional in the restaurant insults some1 like that in the food service industry. wld not recommend this place to my worst enemy on top of that we all got diardiarrhea from their buffet of they're food full of msg. also will b calling the better business bereau bad service and nasty msg food all the way around. While visiting in Az this location is on alma school rd. And southern."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Nice variety of foods and desserts. They have everything , traditional Asian cuisine, rice , noodles , chicken , fish , sushi , egg drop soup (which I love ) , cream puffs , jello , ice cream , etc.   They have a hibachi grill where you make your own dish ! Tasty"}
{"text":"Good food, a little cheap but for the price it's an ama,ing place to eat. Staff are great as well."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Mesa, Arizona and I arrived early in the morning, spent a day visiting a company that lasted til late afternoon, and I realized I have eaten anything yet.  Of course a buffet would be a great option to fill my Jawaiian stomach!  I found this place not to far from my hotel and decided to go check it out.  I walked in and the receptionist simply said, \"Hello, how many people?\"  \"Just myself please.\" Then she called over to one of the waitstaff members in her language and I was immediately seated.   The place was a bit quiet for dinner service. It later in as I continued to dine, it did start to pick up.  I went to check out the buffet and this is what I found...  The dessert island is hosts an array of cookies, pastries like shortbread cookies, coco puffs, cream puffs, assorted jello cubes with no labeling to let you in on what the flavored are.  The next island was a bit confusing, on one half it looked like a salad bar, but there were no lettuce or romaine (they were actually on another island) just topping like croutons, raisins, sunflower seeds, etc and all kinds of dressings.  The other half was assorted seafood fare, shrimp, crabs, oysters etc...  Then next island featured you're usually standard Chinese food offerings and then the lettuce and romaine   I noticed as I continued on there was pizza , a taco bar, and several soups.  Interesting...n'est-ce pas?  Ok, so on with what I had:  Chicken wings - super juicy, crispy on the outside, this was the shining star of everything I had!  Pot stickers - #Rubbery  Beef ribs - they were so juicy and soft, it slid easily off the bone, however, they were bland. Solution: I created a little dipping sauce from the sweet soy sauce for dumplings and added some wasabi from the sushi island, and Bam!   Yeah, you have to do what you can to doctor something up!  The green beans were ok. Al Dente but they were slathered in a teriyaki sauce. It didn't wow me.  Chicken meatballs are good - no complaints there!  Kim chee - I wish they never drained the juice from the plating. What happened was, the Kim chee was dry and had no flavor.  Tofu - you can't screw up raw tofu, I just created my own sauce of soyu & scallion I found at their grill section.   Hehehe  Egg drop soup- it was a little too thick and bland. I added soyu to it.  Orange chicken was a bit of surprise. Often times it's all breaking and very little hint of chicken meat. In this instance,  it was actually pretty good.  During my dining experience, I noticed that it was hot and muggy in the area I as sitting at. I asked and found out that the air conditioning wasn't turned on!  I noticed most of the staff didn't speak much English very well, so your patience will be needed here at this restaurant.  Overall, the food was okay, but I probably would not recommend this place to anyone.  I skipped dessert and closed out the tab and walked away into the sunset!  :)"}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and did not have to wait. The restaurant is roomy, nicely laid out and attractive. I particularly liked the pretty changing lights on room dividers. There were so many rows of items to choose from that everyone found lots ot love. My dad had steamed crawfish, a surprise he was really happy about. He said they were very good. They serve lots of good seafood, including crab dishes and a baked salmon that my son said was \"amazing.\" My brother liked the sushi selections and all the fresh fruit. I even saw enchiladas and pizza! There was also a grill section that we didn't try, being overwhelmed by all the other yummy dishes. The waiter who brought drinks and cleared away plates was very friendly and attentive. At $6.99 for lunch and $9.99 for dinner (excluding drinks), Hibachi Grill Super Buffet is a winner! We're planning on going again this weekend."}
{"text":"For about $8 for unlimited food at lunch, it's hard to beat. There is plenty of variety including sushi, tacos, pizza, YC's style mongolian grill, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, desserts, salads and soups."}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst service experiences I have ever endured. From the moment I walked in the Hostess was rude, barking questions like she was doing me a favor to have me seated in the near empty restaurant.  Once I was waved to my seat, I proceeded to check out the culinary fare. Unimpressive to say the least, the offerings we're numerous but tasteless. The only saving grace was the Sushi bar, which gave a decent offering, yet loosely wrapped and served well above recommended temperature.  I sat down with my first plate and the \"attendant\" (to infer that this person was a waiter would cheapen the profession) stomped over and loudly slammed my glass of coke on the table as he was walking by, I thanked him anyway, being civil and received a disdainful grunt as an answer with nary a glance at me. I was never asked if I was enjoying my meal once, and my refills of coke came with the same rudeness as the first.  Later, to my surprise, my attendant came over to me and demanded to know if I was finished, which I obviously wasn't. I got the hint, and finished my tasteless meal and paid my bill.  I would not recommend this establishment to anyone if you expect civilized treatment or service. If I were the owner I would be deeply shamed by the unconscionable rudeness and barbaric service being offered by this restaurant.  Never again."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars rounding up to 4 for a better than average selection of Chinese and American foods.  Had lunch here a few weeks ago with our regular lunch bunch, Rand, Mike and Mark.  The best part of this buffet is that it's very busy for lunch so the food gets rotated pretty quickly and isn't sitting in the troughs very long.  Funny that the best thing I ate was labeled House Bread, which were little muffins filled with ham and cheese.  So so good!  The other selections were pretty good, nothing to greasy and plenty of meat and seafood options.  I was really looking forward to their Mongolian BBQ but found too many other things that looked good and I was full.  I really did not like the lighting in this place. They use fluorescent lights and just did nothing for the atmosphere and I found it really made the experience less than what it could be.  It just bugged me, although no one else at our table seemed to care.  I'm sure we'll be back at some point in our lunch/buffet rotation!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Not the best. Too many kids running around like wild animals without adult supervision. The sushi isn't bad. The tables are really sticky though, even though they wipe them down."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre, at best. I was so hot in there is was completely uncomfortable. They were cooling the place with swamp coolers during monsoon season....not exactly yet the best idea. The food was okay but the staff was really rude and inattentive."}
{"text":"Wide variety of food.  Normal buffet food (chicken with broccoli, lo mein, fried rice, pizza, wings, teriyaki sticks, etc.) with a Mongolian bbq grill and decent sushi.  Lots of dessert choices.  Overall a great amount of variety for a reasonable price.  Large room, plenty of tables."}
{"text":"As far a chinese buffets go, I'm not sure 5 stars is possible.  however this place did pretty well.  a lot of offerings including mongolian grill and ok sushi.  the place was clean and staff was fairly attentive.  I did have to go through 3 servers to find one that actually spoke English to ask a question.  if around there I would go back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good just what u expect from a Chinese buffet.. The sushi isn't sushi Japanese restaurant quality but is better than most buffets I've been to they have 10-12 different types of rolls ... The grill is pretty good aswell have a variety of veggies,meats and noodles ... Keep in mind this is a buffet and u won't get restaurnat quality food but for a buffet i think it's pretty good :)"}
{"text":"This is my first week after moving to Mesa.. my boyfriend and I decided to try this buffet solely because they sent us a coupon in the mail. We will not be going back. The restaurant looks nice driving by, and is pretty well decorated and kept on the inside. The food however tasted as if it had been microwaved an hour prior and left out in the trays since then. Almost everything I tried gave me the feeling I would get sick later on. We went on a Thursday night during rush hour and there were maybe five or six other. Not a return, and I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Bathroom was disgusting, one stall utterly gross. Overall the place seemed unsanitary, but food was ok.  Hibachi was good, the meats and shrimp were good."}
{"text":"This is a buffet, they have everything from Chinese & Japanese food (including sushi).  For a buffet it was a really good place.  The service was good & it is close to where I live."}
{"text":"Food is fine if you get there around lunch/dinner time...  it can get a bit crowded around those times, but nothing to worry about since it's got plenty of space to move around...  The thing i didn't like was that the floor was a bit sticky...  Waiters are friendly and stopping by every now and then to make sure everything is ok on the table..."}
{"text":"I decided it was time to review this place after having eaten here at least 10 times by now.  Let's start with the menu. Now I have tried numerous buffets around town, and I have rarely been compelled to try seafood at one. I consider buffets a risk ... but I get my fish and sushi here without incident. I love the baked salmon, and yes, it can be used up sometimes... but I've always been able to wait until my next trip up to see if there's a fresh one. Today I tried their garlic shrimp... it was quite good as well. The sushi was very good, and there was a lot of variety today. The Kimchee was kickin' too. So today I saw beef short ribs and tried one. It was spectacular! Very tender and flavourful. I also dipped into the broccoli beef, which I love to get a lot more broccoli than the beef... this broccoli is always to die for.  I have been able to extract mostly meats, fish, and veggies and leave out the carby noodles and rice when I come here... my daughter can eat vegetarian here... it fills most needs very well. The only reason I only do 4 stars is because I have seen the place dirty before, but not so much lately. I also find the silverware and napkins very cheap and the staff not into communication much. All that said, it's not what my family comes here for, it's the constantly good meal."}
{"text":"Decent food but a bit on the pricey side.  The average adult meal (with a beverage other than water) is about $12. Some of the food felt lukewarm, as if it had been sitting out for a while. Also, there weren't many choices for those of us who prefer more chicken and beef and less seafood. More of a balance would have been fine. The restaurant itself wasn't too bad, but as others have pointed out, it did have sort of a humid feel inside."}
{"text":"Everything is pretty elegant and neat. The food is okay, not the best. It lacked flavor and was messy. Another thing is they need to keep the buffet clean. I tried serving my self some food and couldn't because of all the unplaced bins of food in  the way. The workers are nice but i think some are quite rude and lazy."}
{"text":"I took my 3 kids here, spent $40 and regretted every dollar! We won't be returning. There's much better buffets in town, I definitely don't recommend this one."}
{"text":"Had eaten here a few times, but its much worse now, chicken is old hard and sitting out for a long time. Either dried up or over cooked like rubber. Glad they screwed up the bill, will never be going back here ever again."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting. The waitress was prompt in seating me, and in refilling my drink multiple times.  I try to have a little of everything when I go to a buffet get a solid picture of the overall food.  They have a small section for individuals who might be tagging along, kids, or that might want American food.  The sushi area was an average setup. It consisted of about 12 different items. Taste on the few I had was so so. But presented well.  The Mongolian grill chef did great. The cook knew exactly what he was doing and it came out stellar. I do wish they would offer water chestnuts sliced, instead of in just random pebble to thumb nail size pieces. It would be nice to have minced ginger. The broccoli was from frozen and not fresh. The Hibachi sauce was good.  I wish more buffets would offer both spring rolls and egg rolls. This one offered only spring rolls.  The main dishes overall were average at best. Out of the 18 entree dishes I tried nothing stood out as spectacular. They did offer peanut chicken which is a favorite of mine but rarely seen on buffets. That is a shame considering how large this buffet selection is. My recommendation would be for them to start experimenting with some new or alternative recipes and maybe offer some to individuals dining as a fresh option to get their feedback. The peel and eat shrimp was perfectly cooked and had a good flavor to it. Most places the shrimp has not had anything added to the boil. The head on shell on shrimp was pure mush. When trying to peel it the meat just kind of disintegrate in your hands. Egg drop soup was pretty good. Kung pao chicken needed more peanuts. I liked the banana in the wrapped banana peel. Overall a decent buffet, nothing to write home about. Good price."}
{"text":"Tables were sticky not clean the chair cushions are disintegrating the food is not freshly made and lacks of seasoning totally disgusting doesn't even deserve a star"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because we went for a late lunch, and the salad and 'fresh' buffet items (sushi!)  were not so 'fresh'..... overall I was not impressed by the food and would not recommend this place to anyone.  On the brighter side the staff was very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Long time didn't had a buffet. They have a lot of choices; however, the seafood doesn't have that many dishes.  I had the coconut shrimps and it was too delicious! I had another type of oh shrimps, garlic shrimp. Was too light, tasty, and easy to digest! The white rice is good, it only needed a sauce. The dessert was perfect except the coffee cake.  The service was excellent. The drinks came straight away, and they ask us for refills regularly. They try as hard to keep everything clean in the table. Prices are worth the food. (NOTE: for those who eat halal like me, the choices are limited.)  The experience was fabulous. Would go again"}
{"text":"Solid 3 star. Which is ok for buffet. They offer enough where you will find something you like. Only down....sweet/sour sauce tasted like it was cut with ketchup..strange"}
{"text":"We thought we'd give this place one more try after they had a chance to get on their feet after their disaster of a grand opening.  It seems like they've paid attention to the reviews (or complaints by customers) and have improved a bit.  A lot of the old problems have been addressed. The place was much cleaner and I didn't see any kids running around.  The food had more variation (not every dish contained bell peppers) but it still wasn't that great.  The sushi is much better than last time, but mediocre at best.  I'm really happy that they've added to the Mongolian grill.  They've added garlic, chilies, and a choice of several sauces now.    Overall, much better than round one, but I probably won't be back.  Update: 4/10/14  Still visit here occasionally because it sucks the least out of all the other local Chinese buffets and we're usually too poor to go to Pacific."}
{"text":"Hibachi? Super buffet? Let's go!  The restaurant is spacious and can seat a lot of patrons.  The food is your standard Chinese buffet type foods, with maybe a little more soup selection (They had hot and sour, egg drop, and wonton soup when we went).  The sushi looked very dubious, so I stayed clear for the most part.  I did try some snapper nigiri, which wasn't very fresh tasting.  The baked fish item for the night was a large baked salmon, which tasted strangely mushy, so I only ate a few bites.  There weren't any crab legs when we went, just fish.  Service was fast and friendly, and empty trays at the buffet were promptly refilled as needed.  A partial deterrent for me though, was that a lot of the customers here came with their kids which were for the most part unsupervised, so there were a lot of little sticky hands running through the buffet items."}
{"text":"Food was alright I'm not a big fan of buffets. I just heard they have sushi and this place is a buffet soooo I had to check it out. Place looked nice food looked yummy but the sushi didn't taste all great. The crab roll didn't taste like crab, or if that was crab it had a tast like cottage cheese. All in all food was good just not the sushi"}
{"text":"Great mix of Sushi n Chinese  12 rows of food to choose from, including pizza n taco. Buffet price was excellent for the quantity of foods. One negative - bathrooms need to be cleaner."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I know that may be harsh, and I don't mean to offend anyone but this place seriously needs a visit from the health dept. The food here is mediocre at best and the best food here is the processed foods. The Mongolian cook never cleared the grill between meals and didn't cook them anywhere near in order. I saw him pick food out of the trap and put it on the dish that he served to a customer! After I saw that, I knew I had better stay away from the sushi, right next to the Mongolian grill. It didn't appear that he was even remotely trying to cook the food in any kind of order.  I was first in a line of 6 people who brought their food to him to cook, but I received my food last. LAST. The place is dark and dingy and looked mid-evil, it doesn't look like the place had been DEEP cleaned since this place was a steak house...but the last straw was when I went to use the men's room (which I had to do before I left the place considering what I had just eaten here) the only lights in the men's room were above the sinks, the toilets were in a separate area...and they were lit by BLACK lights...! Is this a reference to the food you consume here???"}
{"text":"After moving here from Kansas, my husband and I had to find the best Chinese buffet in town. He requires a sushi bar and I like the make your own stir fry. We had hoped the diid here was great since it had those necessities but it sadly was not. The buffet food is average and the options for the stirfry are lacking and noodles are too thin and not good. We have tried to eat here twice to give them the benefit of the doubt and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"For a buffet, it was really good quality food. We went on a friday around 4pm and it wasnt as busy but it started picking up. They seated up quick and took our drink orders. The food smelled great and tasted great. The sushi was okay. What stood out was getting to make your own dish and have it grilled and prepared. It was really really good. I will be going back to indulge in there food over and over."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Too many selections that don\"t belong in a Chinese Buffet.  Food is barely passable and is poorly seasoned.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Been thier a couple times. One time had crab legs ! Also the individual ice cream was great for my son. Decent sushi."}
{"text":"I am impressed at how solid this buffet turned out given the affordable $10 price tag.. Their options included all of the standard asian buffet items: raw bar, sushi bar, Mongolian grill, steamed bar, an extensive dessert selection, and some notably good choices such as bacon-wrapped shrimp, beef short ribs, scallop/crab baked clam shells and I noticed (but didn't try) that they have a custom taco section.    My choice spot from now on if I am looking to fill up on a large variety of things for a good price. Giant Panda Buffet, in Orlando, has a better selection for about the same price so I can't quite give it a fifth star.. But it well deserves these four!    For a similarly priced solid Indian buffet check out Indian Oven further East. For a more expensive but more expansive buffet (crab legs, more fish) try Pacific Seafood Buffet down South a bit."}
{"text":"If you like mediocre food that is over priced by all means enjoy .. I have given this restaurant chance after chance horrible.. nothing like the hibachi grill in the Midwest I miss their good food ..."}
{"text":"Standard Asian buffet  My server as very helpful  and though we had a language barrier she went out of her way to get me the answer. I really appreciated that.   The grill area was a bit troubling...I don't thin all that raw meat should just be hanging out in its own blood. Quite a disappointment.   Some highlights I found were the beef short ribs, green beans, mushroom chicken, dim sum (though I didn't care for the lotus wrapped thing a ma jig)  For $11 ~ I'd return.   Note- crab is sold by the pound with a 2lb limit."}
{"text":"Several of the people in our party were sick after eating here, didn't seem clean. Would not recommend and for sure will never go back."}
{"text":"Although food is not bad has a good verity the place is disgusting. Everytime I had gone the tables, chairs, and the walls are filthy dirty. I tried to give it a chance maybe just maybe they cleaned up but nope. Never again did I go back. Top it off kids running around bumping to you and the parents sadly to say Hispanics not caring and just gossiping."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I came before when they had just opened and food was great, now they've gotten comfortable and lazy. The \"Mexican food\" you can tell had been sitting for a while, some trays were empty while others were cold. I stuck to the lo mein, orange chicken, and sweet and sour chicken the whole time because those seemed like the only things being replenished regularly. Getting ice cream is a pain when it's low. If I ever come back it'll be during the dinner rush when the food is fresh I'll assume. I did come about 5pm on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Good Buffet, Sushi was decent, lunch specials were decent as well, I like the location..up and coming and they have been remodeling over in that area alot over the past three years, it's getting better. I recommend it if your going to have lunch with your family, just don't waste food, they will charge you extra."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we liked it very much! The food is delicious the service is excellent especially for it being a holiday.  I especially liked the fact there are quite few choices for children."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service. Being our first time trying the location, we were greeted by a lady saying, \"What do you want to drink?\".  I have no idea what to drink.  What do you have?  Perhaps have some type of etiquette and say, \"Welcome, Have you been here before?  Here is a list of beverages.  Before I seat you please tell me what you would like to drink and our server will bring it to your table.\"    Very cold place.  I will not return."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this buffet. They have good food and a lot of it. Most bufett give you a lot of salad options but this one does not, almost all their entrees are filled with meat. The location isn't the best but is convenient right next to the mall and Walgreens.  It really looks like a hole in the wall place but I can assure anyone who wants to try it out, that it is good food and the service is awesome. It's a great night out without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for dinner with a girlfriend. It was her first time here and my second. I really enjoyed there stir fry Grill were you get to pick your toppings and somebody will cook it for you. The young man making me feel very good job. E everything stated great. I got egg rolls and crab Puffs which were both okay. You tried the orange chicken I really wasn't a fan. There desert option is not all that great.  I think they are a little overpriced for the area and their competitors."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by most of the 1 star and negative reviews this place has. I think you need to stay away from this place if you're not use to this kind of place. Go to panda express or something. This place have great food for those who really  appreciate the delicacy of Japanese and Chinese cuisine. Yes they don't serve everything but you have to expect this is a buffet!! Its like going to an American chain like Mcdonlds and expect them to serve HOTDOGS!!! I would recommend this place to anybody looking to try all types of Asian cuisine for cheap!!"}
{"text":"Good food, Large selection, Wide variety.  Busy location.  Attentive staff. I think we would return if in the area again. The cleanliness could use some attention however it was a very busy time."}
{"text":"Very good service and big selection of good food. I had my service dog with me and had no problems with access."}
{"text":"Drink service was quick and the food remarkably fresh for a Thursday night. The sushi was just Ok, mainly because it was way over temp. All of the hot food was very flavorful and all of the employees were friendly. The men's room was a disaster. Finally a Chinese restaurant I enjoy near my home!"}
{"text":"One word: GREASY. The meat and vegetable dishes are so soaked in oil that you can't even taste the food anymore. Sushi is crap, and nothing on the buffet line seemed freshly made. I guess for 10.59 you get what you pay for. Better off buying a good piece of steak and cooking it at home. The only thing I enjoyed eating was fresh fruit and dessert"}
{"text":"when this location opened,  I was pretty pleased to have it so close to home.  The first couple of visits were decent.  Fast service and always seemed on top of refilling our drinks. (even before we were finished)   Their selection is really not all that great.  Their lo mein is very very bland and I recommended adding a lot of soy sauce for any type of flavor.  Their baked salmon is questionable and is usually over cooked.  I think it has a dill sauce over it which was not very good.    I mainly stick to their sauteed mushrooms and spicy chicken.  Some of their other dishes like the teriyaki chicken and most of their beef dishes are a bit greasy and sadly, that is all you taste...grease.   I'm done with this place and am looking for another Chinese buffet close to home that is at least somewhat satisfying.  Oh and almost $11 for lunch on the weekend is a joke."}
{"text":"Has been way too long since I had been to my first ever favorite valley buffet. I had got here a couple minutes past 11 today. Lunch buffet has only been raised 60 cents in 2 years. It is now $7.59 (8.20 after tax) Takeout is $4/lb for lunch and $5/lb for dinner (Dinner and weekend price is $10.59)  I was greeted right away and taken to a seat.  Specialty Areas:  I ordered a water and proceeded to go to the Mongolian grill. This one has 4 different meats: octopus, beef, chicken, and pork. They have both rice noodles and yellow noodles, as well as a variety of different veggies including red and green peppers and water chestnuts. I also grabbed some of their various sushi which was well presented. Both were pretty good, definitely a good idea.   The Buffet Tables: They, like every valley buffet, have tacos and taquitos. I remember them being better but they were still okay. They had a lot of different seafood options, from shrimp, to crab to octopus to steamed fish. The orange and teriyaki chickens were pretty good but the sweet and sour chicken (or rather the chicken next to the sweet and sour sauce that is generally accepted to be for the sauce) was blah as was the overcooked fried fish. They have a very large variety of deserts including 4 different types of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and rainbow) prescooped into little styrofoam cups.   The Best: The peanut chicken is amazing! A lot of people might think ew peanut butter and chicken.... but it's actually pretty good... and it's Thai so it's not unusual something someone threw together. The cheese wontons were good... was worried they'd be tooth breaking but they were just slightly crunchy with enough filling. They also had really good house bread. You know those little shells that have the stuffed crab or whatever in them? It has that type of filling only better on top of nice slighlty crunchy but still moist bread. They had good stuffed mushrooms and cheesy spinach. As mentioned before, all the chicken (minus sweet and sour) was good and to finish I recommend those little mocha cakes and some of the delicious banana desert (banana pudding with bananas and soft cookies)"}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years. It has always been delicious with a wonderful selection and is incredibly well priced (during the weekday lunch, only $8). Really like the sushi -- all you can eat makes it Extremely affordable compared to Anywhere else that I know of. And the delicious Tiramisu (coffee-flavored Italian custard dessert cake) is another of my favorites here. This is the best super buffet that I know of.  Here are a couple of other nice, all-you-can-eat buffets that I have enjoyed: https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-corral-mesa?osq=Golden+Corral https://www.yelp.com/biz/old-country-buffet-mesa-2?osq=Old+Country+Buffet https://www.yelp.com/biz/souper-salad-mesa-3"}
{"text":"Hibachi has a really impressive variety, and I'm impressed how how fresh things appear. (Often in a buffet, things get looking a little tired.) We were surprised at how good the little chicken wings were...actually very moist and the skin had just a nice crispness. The bok choy was perfect. I was a little sad about the macaroons - I usually can't resist them, but they really look mass-produced. Didn't even try them this time. But the desserts are fluff. The REAL food was very good."}
{"text":"This is your average Oriental buffet. We arrived for lunch about 2:30. We were not greeted immediately, but after a couple minutes we were seated and our drink order was taken by the seating hostess. The décor did not lend much to the ambience. The place was pretty plain. The furnishings were nice. The restrooms not the cleanest.     The food selection was good with a few items you don't normally see at an Oriental buffet. There was a taco bar which had a few Mexican standards. The trade off was that several things I am used to seeing at other buffets weren't present. No green beans or baked salmon. Maybe they did have them and at some point I can't be sure because several pans were empty. The sushi here was average at best. It is freshly made, but sits too long and gets warm and dried out.     There was a nice selection of desserts and several flavors of ice cream which I did not get. They were bulk containers in a chest freezer that people scooped out of. I just wonder how many hands have touched the sides of the containers while reaching in to scoop out the ice cream.      The price was rather inexpensive. I may return sometime if in the area, but I won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"No star from the Sushi Chef who gave me dirty looks for NOT putting the thongs back to the plate-instead I placed the right next to the sushi where it should be.  He also screamed at me for dropping some wasabi into the ice stand (he place this all the way in the back and left a knife in the tub where it is rather difficult put on my plate properly.  I still believe service staffs is here to provide a service and NOT to holler at the customer-especially it was not entirely my fault.  I have complained to the owner and other service staffs and they immediately apologized had the word with the chef.  The food is mediocre at best but no one should treat their paying customer with disrespct when the placement of the buffet stand is poor.  I should have left immediately but I feel that I already place the food on the plate and it will be thrown away if I don't eat it.  Feeling awful, the food naturally didn't taste rancid so  I left feeling furious and it will be hard press for me to go back.  After all, I am a customer I will NOT and should NOT pay anyone to treated me badly and neither should you.  I will NOT return."}
{"text":"Saw the wait staff use a floor scraper sitting next to a floor drain to break up ice in the ice machine and then take the ice to the ice holder for the soda machine. I called the health department on them. This was done in the open hate to see what goes on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The food was not as good as we hoped. People working there were hard to understand. The only thing that was good was the big variety of food. We were over charged and realized after we left that they charged us for 4 adults instead of 3 adults and 1 kid. Over $70 was not worth it. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Thought we would try a new place as we tend to eat at the same places. Not good:-( Curiosity killed the cat. Food has no flavor and/or very greasy."}
{"text":"The food is decent, the price is reasonable, but I'm really starting to get annoyed by the waitstaff ignoring me."}
