{"text":"Great sushi! Didn't have one bad piece, and we ordered 8 different rolls. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not really sure what the hype is. The service is good but it's pretty average. Fish was decent though you could taste the butter dish was frozen before. The fish on the sushi was so  thinly sliced you can see light through it and the udon is flavourless."}
{"text":"FRESH ingredients + SKILLED chefs = 4 happy stars :-) 

Dined here on a chilly Friday night. My companion and I ordered the Genki tempura appetizer and Sapporo sushi combo to share.

Genki tempura is lightly-breaded & fried salmon skin served in a bowl of sweet teriyaki sauce. We often don't see this option at restaurants, so we decided to give it a try and were delightfully pleased. Genki is great if you like the fragrant taste of salmon. The texture is light & tender on the inside, fluffy-crunchy on the outside (panko crust). The generous serving of sweet teriyaki sauce will tempt you to order more. 

Sapporo sushi combo has 9 pc. sashimi, 5 pc. sushi, 3 pc. rolls, 6 pc. tempura and 2 pcs. gyoza ($17). It's a great platter that impressed us from corner to corner of the bento box. The chef's fidelity to fresh ingredients from sashimi to fried things makes this place a gem. Their tempura game is strong- whatever is below the panko is cooked well (ie. shrimp is tender, not hard & old; yam is cooked evenly-through, not fibrous-y). Gyoza stuffing has unique flavours. And as everyone else has said, their fresh fish is delicious- fragrant, soft and smooth; not freezer-burned. 

To boot, we received complimentary miso soup to start and green tea ice green for dessert. Both tasty!

Rounding out the whole experience was the friendly and attentive service, and the well-cleaned space. It's a small one-unit restaurant run thoughtfully and efficiently. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Prices went up. My Sapporo Combo A is now $23.95...but quality and freshness is still there. Still my fav place to get my fix"}
{"text":"Ok, have only been to this place once, but immediately after I ate the first spicy salmon maki I recognized that it was the best sushi I've had in Cleve easily. Only place that comes anywhere near it is Pacific East on Coventry.

It's awesome to be able to watch the chef prepare the sushi at the bar. Salmon was fresh and fatty. PERFECT amount of rice (WHY do sushi places overdo the rice GAH!). 

Anyway, the place IS tiny as others have posted (likely with slow service during peak lunch hours), but I'm not docking stars for that .. you take what you can get in Cleve. I went for dinner and there was only one other customer there so no issues with order speed.

Prices are VERY reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"This place was great. Service, food, prices. Everything. 

My girlfriend and I were looking for a late night bite around Highway 7 and decided on sushi because there's an abundance of places up there. The restaurant is not much to look at from the outside but inside it's very quaint and authentic looking.

It was 30 mins before close on a Friday so the staff had every right to be short with us but we were met with nothing but smiles and politeness the whole time. As we had never been there before, we had a bunch of questions and the waitress answered everyone of them, explaining things very carefully so we knew exactly what we were getting.

As good as the service was, the food was even better. It's not AYCE but the prices are very reasonable. We ordered Spicy Salmon, which might be the best I`ve ever had, and the Fire Mountain roll, which is a little different, but I liked it. Also the bulgogi bento box which was simple, but tasted really good. I`m not a big fan of green tea ice cream, but it was good there. 
Only complaint was that we didn`t like the green tea itself, which really is not that big a deal.

This place gets bonus marks for the menu explaining all the ingredients in every menu option. Sometimes you don`t know what you`re getting in a dragon or volcano roll but their menu explains what`s in each item which is very rare at most sushi places."}
{"text":"Best place for bento's. Other than AYCE, this is the second place that I go to for my non-AYCE sushi cravings (the other place I used to live closer, but now I go once in a blue moon literally because of distance).

Hands down best spicy salmon roll that I've had so far. Nice chunks of salmon, with good flavor on the spicy sauce, with a bit of crisp and some fresh green onions. Flavor is amazing, nothing like the ones where they roll up a bunch of panko/tempura batter and a small piece of salmon and call that spicy salmon.

Salmon bento box has great value too! $12.95 for 9 pc salmon sashimi, 5 pc sushi (2 salmon/3 eel), 1 spicy salmon/california handroll, 6 pc spicy salmon/california roll + miso soup & salad ($2 to upgrade to seaweed) and ice cream if you dine in. Haven't found a better place to get my bento's. Salmon is very fresh and in nice sliced good sized (to even big sized sometimes) chunks too.

Great sushi platters too, we order sushi platters from them everytime we have family events"}
{"text":"Sapporo is my favourite sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill.  I've been going to this restaurant a bunch of times over several years and the food has always been superb. 
Very friendly service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"fair prices with really good sashimi. the lunch special was decent and filling however the weird part was different people get different sushi with it at the same time."}
{"text":"Sapporo Sushi is Richmond Hill's best-kept secret. Hopefully more people will enjoy more great sushi more often!

The best dishes to try is their Salmon Bento and Katsu Bento. At amazing prices and of great freshness, you never fail to get value! I've brought friends who weren't sure about salmon sashimi, but once they had it at this place, they were completely won over. If people aren't asking for it, then you will never know how fresh something is. I noticed how many people were asking for it.

Their combo also comes with either a crispy or spicy salmon hand roll and miso soup - both of which were brought out nicely on time to wet the appetite. The miso is made with a high-quality miso, so it isn't the average salty miso soup you would get elsewhere.

The restaurant is run by a really awesome owner, who cares a great deal about giving the customer the best experience. I read the other reviews and I think you have to take each of those opinions with a grain of salt. I have been there over the course of a few years, at least once a month. They consistently passionate about what they do and give you higher quality at value prices.

If you're doing a potluck or any take-out they have amazing sushi platters that will wow your guests (& co-workers)."}
{"text":"I went there in October and November 2017.
and I had an excellent experience...
1. sushi boat (for 3 people)
2. small sushi boat (for 2 people)

both times, they gave us more handrolls, more soup because we had 3 people.
the servers were excellent, even though their little quint restaurant was packed. These girls remained courteous, friendly... 

the sushi was good...it was the service that really impressed me! 

tip: the sea urchin can be a bit fresher..."}
{"text":"Last week, I came to this restaurant for a lunch with my friend at the first time. It's a small place, but very cozy and pleasingly simple. They have a wide variety of choices on the menu, as well as party tray takeout. 

We ordered one Lunch Special #1 for $9.95 and one Udon combo served with 6 pcs roll for $13.95. Just as other places, it took reasonably amount of time served us the food on our table. The food was decent and its food portion was just good enough for us.  

During that lunch period on Saturday, they were a few customers waiting for their food takeouts as well and the waitress was friendly handling the lineups too. However, this place is not a very nearby restaurant to us...."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi options in a very tiny space
Variety of options including BBQ eel, Korean bento box and teriyaki shrimp.
Hard to find parking in this very busy plaza but well worth it once you try the food at Sapporo"}
{"text":"I have been to the plaza this restaurant is located many times but never noticed this restaurant existed because it faces the street rather than the parking lot! I'm so glad my friend recommended me this place because it's amazing.

I've been here twice now, once at dinner and once at lunch, both times we were able to be seated right away. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious. The sashimi is nice and fresh, it almost melts in your mouth. Their lunch sets are around $7 and you get a good amount of food.
Some things to note, chicken teriyaki could have been better and the rolls could have been wrapped better.

Overall, I am super happy about this place. I use to have a habit of steering away from Japanese restaurants for dinner because it's expensive, not anymore!

p.s. they only take cash, debit, or visa!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great. If you're a fan of sushi and in the area, it's a must!

The woman serving (who I believe is either the owner or a part owner) does a wonderful job. She even remembers my order, despite the fact that I've only been here ~3 times over several months. Service is reasonably prompt during the lunch rush, and lightning fast outside of peak times.

Food quality is excellent. Sushi is one of those foods that you can easily so poorly. Sapporo does not.

Price is reasonable as well. I like the Maki Bento Box because for ~ $15 I get more food than I can eat in one sitting.

Overall, I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and ordered the sashimi and tempura bento box both times. The portion size is ample, especially since they give you three complementary appetizers (a piece of grilled salmon, miso soup, and a little portion of noodles). The quality of the food is respectable for this price range. The service is polite but they don't check on you after they bring the food, so you have to wave them over awkwardly for tea and water refills."}
{"text":"The salmon is of excellent quality.  Good service, Reasonable price..  Will keep coming back and definitely recommend it to my family and friends,"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


This is a good sushi place with a pleasant atmosphere and a lot of seating. They do a great job of filling take out orders, often serving a cup of hot tea as you wait for your package.

Sushi is reasonably priced, and usually fresh tasting. The service is consistent and attendant. Overall, you'll have a satisfying sushi experience and you won't pay too much if you order smartly.

3 stars"}
{"text":"A nice place for good quality sushi. The price is reasonable for what you pay.

However, the portions are on the smaller side. The sashimi is thinly cut, and the rolls are small too. But I still enjoy coming here although the portions are small.

The service is good since the restaurant is really small, and servers are very attentive."}
{"text":"Incredible. Great service - had green tea as soon as we sat down. The waitress was very friendly.  The sushi rolls were made perfectly and they also came out promptly. Extremely fresh and decently priced. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Such nice place . Amazing staff . Very good food . Try their salmon skin appetizer . Fair prices.  A lot of variety on their menu.  Oh did I say amazing staff"}
{"text":"This is my favorite a la carte sushi place. It's always fresh and service is always wonderful. 

I especially like the double dragon bento. It comes with 2 dragon rolls, one is a shrimp tempura roll with salmon sashimi on top and the other is a crab stick roll with unagi on top. With a miso soup to start, you also get a choice of crispy or spicy hand roll (I always get the spicy hand roll. Yum!). Salad comes with the rolls in the bento so you get your vegetables with your meal. Finish with complimentary ice cream and topped with 2 pocky sticks!"}
{"text":"Food okay but Terrible Service! 
I've been to this small Japanese restaurant a couple of years ago and enjoyed it but forgot about this place.  Somehow, I thought of this place this evening and it started off okay. We were greeted when we arrived, the waiter seated us close to the door and we asked to be moved more into the middle of the restaurant because it was cold. he was friendly enough to accommodate but mentioned that it was cold regardless of where we sat. He was prompt in serving tea and providing the menu. Later I mentioned it was nice and warm and he mentioned the owner turn on the heat for us. Nice, but frankly its the end of October and it was cold outside! Anyhow, the we ordered the food (bento box, served with soup, salad and green tea ice cream) and an order of spicy salmon.  The spicy salmon was very delicious and served quickly. The soup & salad came out shortly after and it was alright. The bento box came out in good time but then it went down hill. We had to repeatedly request for tea and had to let them know we had finished our dinner. We waited close to 20 mins, waiter never came back to refresh out tea or serve the green tea ice cream.  We finally gave up and went to the cash register to pay and leave. Forget the ice cream! Their service was quite dismal and I think this place had potential. I won't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Unless you have more than 2 hours for lunch, DO NO EAT HERE! I can't comment on the sushi since we never got our food after waiting 45 min past the time we put our order in.  About 4 take out orders came in after we ordered..they were given priority while we had to wait. When we told the lady behind the counter we're leaving, she waved us off very unapologetically.  Not sure how this place stays in business with such lousy customer service."}
{"text":"My all-time FAVOURITE.  I live downtown and travel up to eat here regularly.  The sashimi is so fresh and their rolls & platters are generous.  Udon noodles are chewy and tender--just perfect.  Their rice is seasoned very nicely.  Spicy salmon maki comes overflowing with spicy salmon on top...sooooo good!   Their lunch bento boxes are delicious and very good value--always come with lots of little things to try.  I never come out of here feeling heavy or sick.  Some good Korean dishes are also on the menu (e.g. bulgogee), as I belive they are Korean.  I've been supporting this restaurant since it's start back in the old Dominion plaza 10+ years ago, and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"The sashimi platter I ordered on Monday was certainly not fresh.  Other than the popular salmon and tuna, the hamachi, ika and saba were stinking.  I've also tried their uni, and their's was the worst in terms of freshness I've encountered.  Maybe they thought I wouldn't be able to tell in terms of quality, but a lot of the raw food they served that day had an overdue stench to them.  Very dissapointed, and sad I had to swallow a  spoiled uni because I didn't want to spit it out and gross out the person collecting my plate after.  Spent $50 on a lot of sashimi that should have been thrown out.  :("}
{"text":"Sapporo Sushi has been one of my favorite restaurants for almost 15 years now. The small restaurant has friendly staff and probably the best value of any sushi restaurant around.

Dinner special number 1 is the perfect mix containing sushi, sashimi, a hand roll, maki, soup, salad and ice cream for dessert. All that for $12, it really can't be beat.  Give this place a try (preferably not on a Friday or Saturday night)"}
{"text":"This is a sushi restaurant that I wouldn't mind going once a while to satisfy my sushi craving since the location is convenient and pricing is pretty good.

The restaurant is quite small but as soon as you're greeted and seated by one of their friendly staff, you will be able to relax in one of their roomy booth seatings.

They waitress are quick with taking the menu and there's always a complimentary dish served as appetizer along with miso soup and seaweed; it's not a lot but it's 'complimentary'.

They have exceptional service but I can only give this place a 3 stars since the sushi and sashimi lacks freshness and not that great compared to other sushi restaurants I have been too that are just slightly pricier.  

I'd recommend this sushi place if you are in the yonge-finch area.  Again, the service is excellent and the food is reasonably priced.  However, if you're looking for a more authentic sushi restaurant then you may be a little disappointed.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Very small and humble place, but fantastic sushi! I always order spicy salmon and sashimi there, and their fish (in my opinion) is really fresh. Also, if your order reaches $20, they give 2 free handrolls!"}
{"text":"Walked in at noon for takeout. They were really friendly and only took about 10 minutes for fresh and delicious sushi to go!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem among the all the Chinese restaurants in the plaza. A small but good quality place for sashimi! The price is a tat high but it is acceptable to pay another visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! The food is great, and staff are friendly. I come here to satisfy my salmon cravings. It's also very well priced :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi bento and my boyfriend got something similar with tempura. The fish was great and is much better than any other Japanese restaurant in the area at the same price range. The rolls are ok and nothing special. The salad is pretty bland and the tempura was actually some of the worst i've had. The shrimp had little crisp to it and the vegetable pieces had absolutely no crisp. Why I still gave it a 4/5? because I will just order the sushi/sashimi bentos every time and avoid the tempura. It's pretty good value"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, Terrible sushi!  
Tiny, miniature sushi to match the dinky restaurant.  The kitchen takes up half the space while the tables are cramped together in front of the sushi bar.  I had the 12 piece sushi set plus I shared a roll with a friend.  The tiny piece of rice they use for the sushi is hard and tasteless.  And when I say tiny, i mean TINY.  The rice turd they put in the sushi was barely the size of a quarter.  The fish they use on top was edible, but really thinly sliced.   The maki roll we were serve was about 10 pieces but it was so thinly sliced, and stuffed with so much vegetable filler that it tasted bland.  One piece of maki didn't even have enough rice to wrap around it, but they tried to cover it up with a thin slice of fish.  I wouldn't feel so bad about the quantity if the quality was there, heck I'd just order more if it was actually good!  But it was bad!  You want to go there and see how bad this place is, go ahead and have a good laugh!  If you expect a good meal, stay away!"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh, rice was moist and soft. Offers a wider selection of rolls, with a few that are deep fried. Service was good.  Complimentary appetizers included fried salmon, which was different. Also enjoyed the complimentary green tea ice cream!

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I used to always like the 2 people sushi/sashimi combo at Sapporo, but today I experienced the worst service.

Walked in at 6:30pm, we were directed to sit at a tiny table that could barely accommodate 2 plates. So we requested to change sits to a booth. 

One waitress promised us ok but told us to wait for 5 min because she needed to clean that booth. We of course said ok and were patiently waiting. However after 1 minute, 2 guys came in and another waitress directed them to the booth I wanted immediately. I didn't argue with the waitress because I saw there were at least 3 other booths either available or getting vacant soon. So we told the waitress we could take the next available booth instead.

However, for the next 3 available booths, each was given to customers that came in after us. Even after I told the waitresses every time that I wanted the next available booth. Seriously, do u not know what's first come first serve??

Ended up leaving the restaurant without ordering anything, but simply sitting there for half an hr seeing our table got taken. 

Bad service intimidates customers more than bad food quality. I think Ichiban will be my favorite Jap restaurant in north york area now."}
{"text":"I find Sapporo to be one of the better sushi places in the Yonge/Finch area, although if you judge a book by it's cover, then like me, you would never have stepped foot in the place until your picky eater friend told you that it was one of his favourite sushi places.  What I think makes Sapporo good is that they slice up the fish properly - nice and thin - and with only a little bit of rice under it, not huge crunchy balls of rice like some places.  The rice is also properly seasoned and very fresh and soft. The food is served with lots of sides: miso soup, salad, and a small noodle soup bowl.  My favourite here is the chirashi, I think it's a great deal for $12.95 (dinner price, i think it's around $10 for lunch). Last time I went, a bunch of us split a sushi boat  and all the rolls that it came with were delicious too."}
{"text":"A great place to eat sushi 
It's a cozy area to be in, while spending time with friends or family. I got the chirashi donburi, and it's just enough for my appetite. Not too much and not too little.

Would definitely return when I have time"}
{"text":"WOW, can I give this place 6 stars instead? I decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews, and was thoroughly impressed with this hidden gem! LOVED IT!! It is #1 on my list for best sushi restaurant I've been to thus far.

The fish is extremely fresh - not fishy, nice fattiness to the salmon, so soft it is basically flaking apart, and melts in your mouth. Most importantly - the PRICE... it is the best \"bang for buck\" I've ever seen - great quality, good quantity, very reasonably priced. Everyone around me ordered bento boxes which I assume to be the popular choice since it has a bit of everything for a very modest price (under $15)

HIGHLY RECOMMEND: 

- SALMON BENTO BOX SPECIAL, which was $10.95 and you get: 10 salmon sashimi, 2 salmon sushi, 2 eel sushi, 3 pcs of california sushi, 3 pcs of spicy salmon
- Any of their sushi rolls, but my personal favourites are SPICY SALMON (best spicy mayo ever) and TORO ROLL (lower-end grade of fatty tuna - a rare delicacy that I had to try and was impressed by its freshness)
- 20 pcs of SALMON SASHIMI for $9.99 (I didn't order this but saw people around me getting it, and no wonder, this price for this quality of fish beats AYCE)

**NOTE: Bento boxes came with FREE spicy salmon handroll, miso soup, salad, and green tea ice cream on the house. Please tell me I'm dreaming... where else can I get this much food for something remotely close to the price?!

LOVE LOVE LOVEEE THEIR ROLLS... they are compact (little rice, full of fresh ingredients) and doesn't fall apart when you eat it! My boyfriend got a dragon roll bento box also ($10.95 for 2 dragon rolls including above freebies) and the eel is FRESHLY grilled, not the frozen premarinated stuff you see at Asian supermarkets.

Service was A+. Small restaurant, so waitresses are extremely attentive. Case in point? The waitress overheard I wanted Toro sushi and told me she would check if they had any in stock prior to me ordering... and personally removed cucumber in the free appetizer because I said I didn't like it. Constantly refilled tea.

CONCLUSION: You can't go wrong coming here. I was satisfied beyond words. Will be back again FOR SURE. 

**Side note: I noticed they had an industrial freezer storage at the back of the restaurant where they kept the raw fish. They also have posters plastered everywhere with the Eat Smart logo for meeting standards of quality, cleanliness, etc. NOW that's how you get fresh fish. Rest assured you won't get food poisoning here."}
{"text":"Here are the main points about Sapporo sushi:

- For the sushi, the chefs lay the fish on thick.  They definitely are generous with the fish!  
- Complimentary barley tea shall be given
- Sometimes*, they're a bit slow with the service, and they're not especially cheaply priced, but..
- so much fish.  Nice, thick cuts of fish.

Overall, I like this place!  I work in the area, so I typically go here for lunch.

*like, 10% of the time"}
{"text":"I could have sworn I reviewed this restaurant before. But they've renovated since my last visit (which was over half a decade), so that's just as well.

Queenie picked me up from my house because she heard I had hair products to give away. I won a bunch of things at a fitness competition. I came in second place, which is to say I didn't win. But second place for a person who doesn't train anymore is a slap to the face to all other competitors. Anyway, I have no use for hair products.
Somehow, we ended up going to dinner at Yonge & Finch?

Sapporo Sushi is now a well lit, more spacious feeling restaurant with a dining floor capable of facilitating tables up to eight people per group. The chef with his big fish knife works diligently behind the....sushi preparing station thing. 
Two competent waitresses move like the wind in and out of the kitchen.
The waitress who took our orders without writing anything down was totally hot. When she asked me what I wanted, I just smiled and stared into her big soft eyes, while Queenie dictated our orders, probably slightly annoyed by me.    
Listen, any waitress who doesn't needs to write down the list of things I want to eat has a very good memory, you know what I'm sayin'?

I don't remember the fish here being so fresh, but damn the sushi I had that night was spot on! The sashimi was beautifully sliced, it was tender and not frozen. Or..at least it didn't taste frozen. Frozen sashimi just nullifies the taste.
The sushi was intact, and did not fall apart after I rigorously dipped it in wasabi & soy.
Everything just tasted right. Between the two of us, we paid the same as we would have at a AYCE sushi restaurant of completely lesser quality. 
Queenie offered to pay, but I got the bill instead, probably because I felt slightly guilty about consistently shifting my eyeballs away from her, and towards the cute waitress. 

An average plate of sushi at $9.50, generously rolled with fresh tasting ingredients. I do think they need to step up their tempura game. I don't believe shrimp is an appropriate animal for tempura prices at what tempura is priced at today. Prawns, minimum! Raise the price (a little bit), I don't care, but I want it bigger!

Lastly, its called Sapporo, but there is nothing Sapporo about this place. Unless the women are all really cute there.."}
{"text":"I was there just for ramen, but I was shocked their so-called \"ramen\" is actually normal instant noodles which u can buy from any supermarket with 1 dollar. And they charge 8.95 for it!

And even it's instant noodles, it took them about 40 mins to serve. Their sushi is just okay, but just base on the quality of ramen, I probably not gonna be there again. Expensive and not worthy to wait."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant hoping that I would get some great sushi in downtown Cleveland. Well, I walked in and sat at one of their tables and wasn't even greeted. There were 4 other customers in the restaurant and only 1 sushi chef/cook/waiter. I waited for 12 minutes without the guy even acknowledging I was there before just walking out of the place. Why spend your money at a place where its not cheap and they don't even want you there. Bad service, unfriendly staff, and dirty tables. Steer away from this place if possible. AVOID"}
{"text":"I have never eaten at this plaza, but here is a first time for everything.

This restaurant is not noticeable at all, and if it weren`t for my fiancé wanting to try this place out with friends, I would have never come here.

Place is small, but clearly, many people know of this place. It was quite busy and there were a lot of non-Chinese patrons. 

Food was okay - cheap. Our table ordered a lot of fried things which I wasn`t a fan. We also ordered a big Sushi/Sashimi boat for the table and I didn't eat much. There was one Veggie roll which was delish, but that's about it.

Service was excellent! Our waitress was all smiles and exceptionally pleasant. She was very sweet and a full star just for that!

Won't come back here again, but that being said, it was busy and popular for a Monday night. Recommendations for a large group recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer years ago and then had about a 5 year gap after I moved away. Recently, have been coming here pretty consistently for the last year. Here is a quick run down of highlights for me:

Price: bento combos and especially lunch specials during the weekdays are by far Thu best value here. Evenings and weekends still have decently priced menu items but if you are going for a bang for the buck factor, then I would rate it above average for lunch and average for all other times

Food: the food taste and quality for the price is pretty good. There are many many worse tasting and non- fresh places that are the same price. There are also many better quality and tasting restaurants but at a significant premium in price. I believe that they are positioned appropriately.  

Service: every time I come, I get attentive and good service. Part of it is because I'm a regular I'm sure. But even before they started recognizing me, the service was still pretty above average.

Establishment: nothing over the moon here. But I'm easy to please and don't look too much into decor. Simple and clean s mostly what I ask for. 

Overall: when I rate an establishment it's a blend of primarily price and quality of food. The mix of these two at Sapporo is quite good. Good service and a simple clean atmosphere make it a go to place for me.

Edit: the photos are not entirely representative because the regular chef was not here today."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in the wall sushi, but I love it! It's cheap, good and fresh. I wish it would open later. There is only 1 guy making sushi there, so you have to be patient!  I think its the best \"fresh\" sushi in town, I don't think fried sushi is real sushi. Anything fried can be good, and he makes the real \"raw\" sushi pretty good, if thats what you like."}
{"text":"It was a pleasantly ambienced restaurant. Cozy, seats no more than 30 guests. Customer service was up to my standards; each waitress was exceptionally friendly. We tried the katsu bento, Sapporo bento, and udon combo. Udon soup was wonderful. The sashimi in the Sapporo bento was one of the freshest I've had in a while, and the tempura was fried with a reasonable amount of flour and oil. Katsu was absolutely delicious, dipped with their special mayo sauce. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Small and simple little restaurant. The bento boxes are good, but the uni wasn't fresh when I tried it. The prices are about average. The food wasn't spectacular, but not bad either. It's a good lunch option if you work/live in the area. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Richmond Hill.  It is small and cozy.  This is my new favorite sushi spot now. (Been here 8 times now).  Price is fantastic for what you are getting.  I usually order the Double Dragon combo which comes with a handroll as well.   The Spicy salmon handroll is amazing!!  You also get Miso soup and Green tea ice cream with your meal.  

I highly recommend this place but it can get full quick and the wait could be long so beware."}
{"text":"This was a quick solo dinner for me.  I was early for the dinner crowd, but there was no one in the restaurant, but me.  Service, therefore, was solid.  The food is good.  I felt the prices were very fair as well."}
{"text":"Excellent and very fresh. Mango Tuna Roll out of this world. Also ordered the spicy tuna spicy salmon, just the right spicy hot"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Prices are decent (they have good lunch specials) and the food was decent, but nothing to write home about. The service was great but what is not great is cleanliness/decor. I still feel the food is hygienic but the sticky floors and outdated washroom turns me off. If you don't care about that stuff though and only care about price then this is the place to go. It's a Korean place and the one waiter there speaks English and is nice."}
{"text":"Went during dinner time with my boyfriend and ordered bentos that had sashimi and it took a really long time to be served even though there was no one in the restaurant. the sashimi tastes like it was just out of the freezer and didn't have enough to defrost."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! Staff was friendly but the space is small and service is slow (a little slow not uber slow) but when the dragon roll came out I knew why it was - the presentation was fantastic that I no longer minded the wait. Busy place for what I thought was a hidden gem.

Would definitely come back here for the sushi because the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the four star review. Although I am very very picky about my sushi. 
It's alright at best. Not a ton of variety. 
If you do takeout and pay in cash, you save on the taxes. Worth the 13% if you're not trying to collect credit card points. Theres better sushi joints in the area. 
Parking in this plaza is just awful."}
{"text":"Used to come here often for dinner and decided to revisit for lunch! Was very pleased to see a nice lunch menu with both korean and japanese specials. Most dishes were only 6.99-8.99 at most including sushi dishes (!!!) so I was very excited to order my lunch. I got one of the sushi lunches that came with a california roll and a specialty roll (I got crab salad roll) and I was fairly pleased with what I got. To be honest their sushi is not as good as they used to be when I visited in the past. BUT I also paid more for my food back then when compared to these incredibly well-priced lunch specials. With this in mind I would definitely recommend this place to satiate a quick sushi (or even Korean!) craving especially if you happen to be on a budget =)."}
{"text":"i really should have gone to yelp first before coming here!  What are all these great pictures of food from here! Is that at dragon sushi!!!

I used google maps to find this place for a dinner with some out-of-towners in the area.. serves me right for trying something new!

The place is actually harder to find than I thought as it is in a busy plaza but the entrance is not connected to the parking lot.  The place is small, and reminded me of Sushi Kaji, in Etobicoke, in terms of the # of seats.  It was decently packed, and our group of 7-8 took up at least half of the restaurant.  Which also means that any general conversation between 8 people simultaneously, in a small space means that the noise level was loud (sorry to all the other patrons).  

The food was ok.  We got a boat and some other sashimi but if I'd only checked here I'd have ordered a lot more of the rolls and probably rated this place much higher.  The sashimi was good but I'm not well versed in sashimi flavours and generally eat what anyone else tells me is good.  My only disparaging comment would be related to the salmon sashimi which had an...odd flavour to it.  No amount of wasabi-soy sauce could get it out of my mouth.  

The service was good.  The server was really attentive to sweeping in exactly when we weren't talking to each other, a hard feat to do when there are 7-8 people, but I noticed and appreciated it!

Sapporo Sushi definitely deserves a second visit to try the rolls!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cute little sushi place that isn't AYCE in uptown Richmond Hill?  Tired of stuffing your face until your belt buckles scream \"oh the humanity\" because you're trying to get your money's worth at Wasabi or Aji Sai?  Well this is your place, the decor and staff inside shout kawaii and you feel like you're right in the pages of your favourite anime.  It feels very Tokyo sushi shop and my personal favourite touch is the blow fish banner draped across the bar area.

Staff here and nice and polite and serve you as fast as they can.  Usually there is only one poor waitress working, so the minute you sit down, you might be waiting a little bit for your green tea and menu.  Your typical bento box meal will run you around $15 and that will come with a soup and salad.  A great price considering how \"so fresh and so clean\" their fish is.  Also they are one of the few restaurants that serve Uni (Sea Urchin), so make sure you grab a slice for your choice of box.

Overall a great one stop shop for your sushi fix in the Uptown district.  I'm like hey whatsup Saporro!~"}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi spot on my visits to Toronto. The fish is always fresh and the daily deals are great: $8 for 20 pieces of salmon on Tuesday? I'm there! The place is tiny and there is definitely a crowd during the regular meal times, so try to get there a bit early. 

The box meals are a great deal - the salmon bento is always a classic winner and for those who like rolls, the double dragon bento (two different dragon rolls) is a great choice.

The ice cream is always great, though the portions are small (sometimes they have a variety of flavours, though often it's just green tea). When they're busy they're slow to refill the cups, but they clean up quickly.

Overall it's a nice place, and I'm glad it's picking up the recognition it deserves :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi is good and the service is very friendly. If they are slow they'll bring you little extras. Great spot to grab a quick and healthy lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Had a late night snack here tonight, decided to try it out.

Great place, friendly service, doesn't seem like too many people are working here but they are really nice and friendly.

Food was great, started off with the Sapporo Sashimi special. Then moved on to the Boston Roll and Dynamite Roll.

The sashimi was really fresh and thinly sliced, probably one of the better sashimi I've had in this region other than Taro Fish Market.

The Boston roll i really liked, there were two uni covered salmon pieces, 2 with fly fish eggs & salmon, and two with normal fish eggs & salmon.

It was deliciousness. The only thing is the miso soup was a bit salty for me and my guests.

Will definitely come back, great place and nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Best sushi downtown. High fish to rice ratio. Service is a little slow around lunch time."}
{"text":"Got the super bento as takeout. Normally, it includes Uni, but this time they said they didn't have any and let me know ahead of time that they'll substitute it with scallop. I'm a bit disappointed because this is about the third time I ordered the super bento without Uni.

Anyway, the portion size for 17 dollars is pretty good. But the quality is merely ok. The scallop was pretty good, but the maguro was not very good (not a very good cut of the fish). The miso soup was also a bit diluted (for comparison's sake, during the last outing at Shinobu, the miso soup was great).

Friendly service tho!

Conclusion: okay sushi for a pretty good price.

6/10 for quality. 8/10 for the value. 8/10 for service. 6.5/10 overall. (Sorry, have to bump it down to 6.5/10 (rounded to 3 stars) considering 1) it wasn't as great as last time I ate here, 2) a bit more expensive now, and 3) the lack of Uni for the third time."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's a bit of a hole in the wall but the price is right and the portions are decent.  The fish is always fresh and the service always friendly.  I usually get either the salmon bento or dinner special 1.  Both of which are very good.  The spicy salmon hand roll that also comes with the meal is my favourite!!!  Parking here can be a bit of a drag though."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that the price cannot justify the quality of the food.
Also, the service is not so good as well.
We asked for more tea for 4 times and we didnt get it at the end.

For this price, there are tons of better japanese restaurants around this area. 

i dont think i will go back again."}
{"text":"Haven't been to many sushi places in Cleveland, but this place is a hidden gem and a family owned restaurant. They don't have really fancy rolls, like trendy sushi bars, but I think that's what makes this place better. You can actually taste the fish. Green tea comes complimentary, which is a plus because every other place charges $3.00+. I wish they had better hours, otherwise I'd be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Exceptional shashmi special.  Lots of goodness for less than $20.  Only down side is no alcohol, but that doesn't pull any of the 5 stars."}
{"text":"???????? (Irasshaimase!) - 4.5/5

I forgot my lunch at home and I was dying for some good grub so I went on Uber Eats app and saw a bunch of restaurants to choose from. A lot of them were out of business (update that YELP) or weren't opened for business yet (lunch time was closing in) but this one was and I decided to check out what they had to offer. In their app menu, they had your usual lunch specials, bento box combos and they even had a chirashi option (sushi toppings like salmon or tuna is on top of sushi rice, kind of like how Koreans have bibimbap, Japanese version, that's what I ordered.

I told my boyfriend about it that day and I surprised him for dinner one anniversary celebration, it did not disappoint. With each order, you get a salad and a bowl of miso soup (not too salty). I ordered the deluxe chirashi and he ordered the regular chirashi (I went with chirashi again because once I like something, I'm loyal FOREVER ).

Presentation - the restaurant is small and quaint with about 10-15 tables, they have some Japanese decor on the walls, overall clean restaurant and washroom

Pros - every restaurant order comes with FREE DESSERT at the end (we had green tea ice cream [I don't rmb what the other options were]) 

Cons - Uber Eats menu is DIFFERENT from the restaurant menu but UE orders comes with salad, miso soup AND a little yogurt drink! 

Fave Eats - CHIRASHI, whether the regular or deluxe, neither will disappoint and plus, THICK CUTS of fish for sashimi 

Price - average sushi price but you get a lot more.

Seconds - YES PLEASE! =D"}
{"text":"Good sushi but soo slow. I do think that it's not just this place it's anywhere you go for sushi for lunch tends to be slow because they have a lot of people ordered sushi to go or for delivery. While we were there for about an hour there was a steady stream of people coming in and getting orders that they had called in. But the sushi was good and the edamame delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch, arrive early to beat the rush.

The salmon is of excellent quality, and they have a special salmon dinner with sushi and sashimi on Mondays.

The rest of the sushi is very good quality and at an excellent price!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little shop with mainly Japanese and Korean cuisines. I've walked pass by it on multiple occasions waiting for them to be open. The current opening hours posted on their window is a bit confusing for me. I'm so glad that I was able to finally stop in and check them out. 

Currently, construction is going on outside the shop so side street parking may be difficult and it's downtown Cleveland, so good luck with that. 

Interior design is definitely influenced by Asian culture. They have many sitting tables as well as bar seating for sushi. Delivery and take out is more common here. 

Service - very kind, quick and accommodating. My server is Korean and I believe is possibly the owner of the shop. Her daughter was at the shop too and was the cutest thing ever. 

Food! They have a variety of options to choose from, but personally it is a bit pricey for me. I settled for a bento box to get my moneys worth and I was not disappointed. The quality of the sushi was good along with the other side dishes. I will definitely have to come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"After visiting the bank in the same building, I thought I would stop by for some sushi. It was early afternoon and I hadn't eaten lunch yet. It was quiet and the only people eating was the staff for lunch. 

In terms of the service, I thought it was ok. Obviously, I was the only person there, so I couldn't really verify the service level. I can say this though, the food came out REALLY quickly. From when I ordered to when the food arrived, was about 5 minutes. 

Now looking at the speed of the service, I can only say that most of it was prepared way before.The fish was really fresh. I really like that. The Gyoza on the other hand was a little bit cold. It tasted like it was precooked, but they didn't take the time to reheat it. The dynamite roll was pretty good. It was supposed to be cold, so I can't tell if it was made way before or made fresh. It tasted pretty good though. 

Over all, it was a pretty good lunch. It wasn't too expensive too. The dish came in at $10.00"}
{"text":"Great food and great price! Whether it's lunch or dinner, this is the place to go if you want fats and delicious sushi"}
{"text":"Another little sushi place I found near work for lunch! Good quality, much better than aki or something in the same plaza.. 
smells a bit unpleasant but you get used to it
salmon sashimi were nice fat & tasty cuts 
Got the lunch special , $11 
Fast service
Overall good"}
{"text":"People are nice and friendly. But the service was a little slow and they didnt check to see if we needed refills. In terms of food, the takoyaki was overdone and didn't taste good. We ordered one love boat and the sashimi slices were very thick and chunky. Our making rolls that we ordered were also not cut properly and the sweet potato roll was very dry. 

We had been to this place once before and wanted to try it again as we live in the area, but I don't think I personally will be coming back. I would rather go somewhere else that has the same price range and get better quality and service."}
{"text":"It is a small restaurant with limited seating. 

We ordered the salmon platter which was salmon focused. 
It comes with 2 handroll (choice of crispy or salmon), 2 seaweed salad or green salad, and 2 miso soup and 2 ice cream.
They prepared salmon in different ways (torched, deep fried with tempura) with different cuts of salmon. There was deep fried tempura battered salmon skin, and salmon belly cut. The platter had spicy salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll topped with salmon. 

Overall it was interesting having a salmon focused platter, prepared in different ways. The platter is meant for 2 people with all the extra stuff it comes with. Serving size was perfect for 2 people and all the salmon was fresh."}
{"text":"A friend of I recently introduced this small-scale Japanese restaurant to me and I realized it is not listed on Yelp.  This restaurant is located at the Alton Tower complex (where the Oriental Mart is) and is kind of hidden in the corner.  I believe it is a Korean-own Japanese restaurant.  It is not a fancy all you can eat restaurant but I was amazed by the quality and price of food!


Special hand roll: it comes with 3 hand roll - 1) Spicy salmom (my favourite!), 2) Crab meat salad, 3) California - for only $5! My must order item!

All day special bento box from $14.95-$16.95 - there's a few to choose from (teriyaki salmon/chicken, bulgogi, kalbi, tempura, etc.), aside from the main course, all boxes come with soup, salad, rice, 3 pieces of roll, 3 pieces of sushi (raw fish), and 12 pieces of sashimi, as well as green tea ice cream!

Most Korean style dinner are from 8.95-$13.95

Most of the food are reasonably price - maki from $3.95-$6.95, appetizer from $3.95-8.95, signature maki $7.95-$11.95 (there's one called Alton Towers roll is awesome!).

They also have special tray for take out only from $20 (35 pieces) to $70 (115pieces) - if you irder one day prior pick up, there's 5% off.  Plus free hand roll with order of $20 or more."}
{"text":"We went there to check this place out - we usually go around the block to Akane Sushi. We ordered the soft crab, one of the sashimi bento boxes, the tempura veggies and shrimp...  The tempura batter was thick and hard, rather than thin and crunchy, really like biting into cardboard. The crab just tasted fried oil. The rolls we ordered were ok, but nothing special. The place is dirty, we sat at a table where we could see straight into the food prep area and the floor was disgusting."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  I have never eat there, always have done take out.  They have good sushi at a good price.  I wish that they had better hours."}
{"text":"Glad I found this small sushi place. Had delicious spicy California roll. Run by husband and wife and it was high quality sushi and lovely service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food was great server was extremely friendly and professional. Care to our every request and needs. Very cozy and welcoming in this establishment. Just enough food for my husband and I. Would definitely come back another time."}
{"text":"I came here several times with my SO and mom over the years. The sushi is a bit pricey, but the fish is fresh. On my last visit here, I had an upset tummy so I decided to eat udon instead of raw fish. I believe it was the seafood udon. When my order came, I started eating it. About 2 min in, I find plastic film in my bowl. I'm assuming some of the ingredients were frozen with the plastic film and someone was careless in the kitchen. I flagged it to the server and she apologized. She said she'll get the kitchen to make me another one - she took the bowl back. I'm usually really hesitant on these things (mostly with Chinese restaurants). I would just suck it up and not eat and have it refunded on my bill. That or they have to leave the bowl there (so I know they made a new one). I've had good experiences here before, so I let them bring it back and make me a new one. When I got my second bowl, without a doubt, I dug into it. Within seconds, I was chewing on another piece of plastic film. At this point, it was comical, but I also knew I would never come back again. The seafood udon was knocked off my bill (of course), but they really didn't do anything to make me feel better or to make me want to come back ever."}
{"text":"Ok I went here with a couple co-workers this week; first time out to lunch with them. The best part of the meal was the company, I work with great people and we always have a laugh or two.

As for Sapporo's nice little family owned place. The dining room is small but service was pretty quick. Nice Lady took our order and brought my soup right away. The soup was ok but nothing I would dance on the table about (they are probably happy as a result that the soup is not AMAZING) LOL.....

Such was just ok. It was not bad but not great. Leaving after 28.00 for lunch (had a Spider Maki although I think they just call it softshell there, and a crab salad roll with unagi (forgot what they call this roll).

Both rolls were plenty big for lunch but plenty small for the price. The Softshell had been frozen vs. Otani (East Side / Mayfield Hts) made fresh to order and flash pan friend.

At the end of the day would I go back? Maybe if I were with a group that wanted to I probably would however I would opt for another place like Sushi rock (which is not the best but far better option) or another food type all together.

I will admit that I eat sushi on a fairly regular basis and I have become a bit of a sushi snob.

End thoughts... Its ok. Not bad not great... but ok. Place is clean and I trust the sushi (freshness / handling)."}
{"text":"Making it easy for you to decide:

The Good:
-Sushi is really really good, Avg price, sometimes surprise bonus rolls in bento boxes.

The Bad:
-place is small, but can usually find a seat.

The Ugly:
-The wait is painstakingly long. You sit... and wait.... and then you oddly start dipping your chopsticks in soy sauce and licking them in hopes for something to tie you over til you get your food. (And don't say this is unique to me....I've seen many people do it!) So finally after watching everyone's face who is has been waiting, get madder and madder, you finally get your food. You scarf it down and its good. You are full. But you probably didn't get your water refilled so you are really thirsty. But for some flippin' reason you keep coming back for more. 

And don't you dare think you are getting carry-out faster and on time. You will patiently wait the hour they tell you to wait to come get it.... then you arrive and wait 30 more minutes standing because they never actually made the food ahead of time. 

So it is odd that I am giving 3 stars, because I am BIG on service. Bad service can RUIN an excellent restaurant. But in this case, good food can somehow overshadow the longest wait ever and keep me coming back for more. Just make sure you have a 1 1/2 hour lunch break! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place & absolutely recommend it to anyone who happens to be in the area ! The lady who serves is the nicest, she always remembers me & what I like & goes out her way every time. The sushi is so good, it hits the spot every time!"}
{"text":"The good reviews that this place got must be fake. How can this place be deserving of 4 stars? 

The spicy salmon roll was tiny and looked sloppy. Falling apart. It literally came a minute after we ordered it so it's pretty obvious this was pre made. 

The beef udon was over cooked. The udon noodles weren't even chewy. The beef was over cooked as well, too chewy. 

We also ordered the sashimi assorted platter. The only decent item was the salmon. The tuna was so awful, almost crunchy. The texture was just not right. 

This place is horrible. Waste of our time and money."}
{"text":"Just ate here the same day as a 5 star review showed (within 20 minutes of the 5 star review) and had a completely different experience. I have been a regular here for years and the place appears to have changed hands in the past several months as there is a new owner/wife team. The decor is more busy with what i assume is their children's drawings and inflated animals hanging in various spots throughout the restaurant. Our table was cleaned with wet wipes since all tables were covered with used dishes. The server just relocated the dirty dishes from one table to another dirty table and pulled out wet wipes and invited us to sit. The kitchen area was also covered with dirty dishes. Our tea tasted as if it were brewed in a coffee machine as it was lukewarm and tasted of water and coffee. My miso soup was also lukewarm. The eel tasted spiny and they put raw items on my friends plate that he never ordered as he is not a fan of raw fish. The older couple that used to run this place kept it cleaner, tea/soup was much hotter, and the overall service was better. The server (wife) offered us small bottles of strawberry yogurt with our check. Apparently, this is a Korean custom to aid digestion after a meal. Just isn't for me. Don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First off: best sushi downtown. 

This is a no frills family-ran establishment in a little street side store front on east 6th street- it's a little hard to find. I am not a true sushi connoisseur (I mean... I'm from Cleveland), so favorite is the Sunday Morning roll, which is a deep-fried salmon and cream cheese concoction that is actually pretty filling. Again, I can not stress enough that this is nothing fancy from the outside or within, so if that worries you then don't go.

If you don't care and just want to eat some sushi, then 100% go and try this place. Like I said, best sushi you can get downtown. Granted, it's Cleveland, so there's not a lot of options to begin with, but if sushi is what you crave - Sapporo will satisfy."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. They came out with a new menu filled with specialty rolls. We tried three of the \"recommended\" rolls! It was amazing! Sweet and savory. The owner of the place was making sure we had a wonderful experience. The rolls were big and the fish tasted so juicy. We were impressed. I highly recommend this place. A bit small and they have some beers available."}
{"text":"Small and cozy restaurant. The food items are fresh, tasteful and priced fairly, though I noticed the salmon grade is different for sashimi vs sushi . Service can be slow on a busy day as they only have one waitress. I believe this place is Korean run but overall they do a very good job in preparing the food. If you want 'decent' Japanese food at a fair price, this is the place."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give it 4 stars, but I can't. Made a reservation because I knew this restaurant was small and it was Saturday night, so there were dinner rushes. We got there about 5 minutes late for our reservation. We had to wait another 5 minutes for a table to clear out so we could sit down. There are about 8-10 tables in the restaurant, and only 1 waitress. she has to do all the serving, the clean up, the hosting, and take orders. Tough for her. Despite the bustle, she was very friendly and very accommodating. 

Food was okay. Sashimi was reasonably fresh. Had the super deluxe bento and unlike their online menu where it says there's yellowtail sushi as well as sashimi, the in store menu says that they have tuna sushi (and not the yellowtail). I much prefer yellowtail. Their super deluxe bento had a piece of uni (sea urchin) sashimi, and that was pretty fresh. It wasn't the best uni I've ever had, but it was passable. The rest of the food here is just that. Passable. It's okay, and the prices are okay, but did I feel like I got incredible value for my food? No. Did I eat anything especially memorable? No. Would I come again? Perhaps if I was in the area, but I wouldn't make the trek all the way here just for some okay sushi.

Nice thing though. We ordered 4 dinners that did not say they came with dessert. We were offered dessert at the end (supposedly included in our meals): green tea ice cream or yoduly. Cute, the yoduly. Got the green tea though. It too was okay.

Interesting last thing to note: Grandpa ordered the BBQ galbi (short ribs) and he couldn't chew on the part close to the bone, so he wanted to cut the meat portion off. They didn't have any standard knives, so they gave him what looked like an IKEA kids knife. Yeah. It helped, but only minutely."}
{"text":"Speedy take out. Shrimp tempura roll was fantastic!! Exactly what I was looking for. Chicken Teriyaki stir fry was good there was a bit of a spicy kick. Cooked with fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Four years ago I tried this place and was fabulous, fortunately they still preserve the quality of a good Sushi.

I have a feeling that the place is owned by Koreans, and I am happy that people from other countries knows how to choose good quality of fish and seafood and serve it as Japanese Level.

Got a special treat from the Chef, invited us to try the new Spicy Salmon Hand Roll, it was delicious. Not that spicy and it allows you to taste the Salmon and the rice. Is definitely recommended as an appetizer.

We ordered a set, but they gave us a premium version of it, which I was surprised. But in the end a mistake was done by the server and we got the premium version by mistake. But believe me, the price of that set it totally worth it. Beside the good quality of the seafood, it taste really good and a perfect quantity. We paid more Tips to cover a bit more for the set, I felt bad just paying so little for that good food and for a mistake from the server.

The price might be a bit high, but here is where \"You get what you pay for\".

In other words, here is not an \"All You Can Eat\" place where you aim to eat repeatedly the same thing until you get full. Here you will get satisfied, you might get full as well and almost for the same price as an AYCE restaurant. You gotta eat quality once in a while ;D

Enjoy your visit!"}
{"text":"The miso soup was warm tonight and not hot.  The spicy salmon hand roll was very good. Food took a little while for an Asian place.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"i'll have to say this is my favourite sushi spot ever since my friend brought me there for the first time! I usually order the salmon lover bento or the \"everything\" ( forgot the name) bento lol. All dinner sets come with a hand roll which is spicy / crispy. Spicy is usually spicy salmon and crispy is basically california style plus some tempura bits. Last time I came I ordered the everything bento LOL which was awesome. Seriiously love this place and I find their sashimi so fresh. My boyfriend ordered the Salmon lover bento which he thoroughly enjoyed. HIs brother ordered the Double Dragon bento which one was a black dragon roll and im not too sure of the order but he wasn't full from that at all! We also ordered a vegas roll I believe.. It has salmon, tuna, alot of other fish then avocado and cream cheese then the whole roll was deep fried. It was interesting and i think it was ok but it really just tasted like cream cheese ): 

We noticed they have lunch special I think for wednesday or thursday its $1 of all udon's but I just really noticed the tuesday special was salmon sashimi for like.. not that expensive . I know this sucks that i don't even know the price T___________T\" next time i'll goo i'll remember the price and UPDATE THIS. (:"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  We came here maybe 2 years ago and 2 years ago it was great. This time coming back was a HUGE disappointment.  I ordered a dinner box with sushi, sashimi and 2 rolls.  First of all, we waited for a long time for our food to come. It's a small restaurant so turn around time should be faster. Secondly, when the food arrived, the sashimi did not look fresh at all.  The salmon was really light pink, the tuna was red, but tasted mushy and even had some tendons in it. This other fish that was silvery and had a bit of redness to it (don't know what it's called), felt like rubber.  I literally took a bite of it and just left the rest of the sashimi untouched as I was paranoid about its freshness. Overall a terrible dinner. Wished we could've spent our money elsewhere. Maybe it was a hit or miss (it really shouldn't be!), but definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Sapporo Sushi is another solid yet unspectacular Korean owned sushi joint. 

The place is quite small and wasn't busy at all on a Saturday evening for dinner. We went with sushi boat C which included 28 sashimi, 24 nigiri sushi, and 2 special rolls - the magic salmon roll (10 PCs) and black dragon (8 PCs) for $76. That's 70 pieces. The value isn't bad considering there were some special items.

Quality was average and decent. Salad and soup was disappointing. Both were a bit bland and the salad was lacking dressing. It looked pretty sad. Selection of items for the boat included some more special items including an interesting tako wasabi sushi (which was pretty good), ebi, hotate, sake belly sashimi, ikura, amongst others. Sushi rice adequate although some pieces did have some older sushi rice which were a tad cold and hard. +1 for the magic salmon roll which was a spicy salmon roll packed with actual salmon and not with breadcrumbs. Dessert was served in the end in the form of green tea ice cream. 

I rather would go to Akane sushi in the same plaza but Sapporo isn't a bad option as an alternative."}
{"text":"extremely polite, great service very price friendly. Comped with soup salad and ice cream as we ordered many items."}

Salmon Festival Combo

Meal set made for 2 or more hungry individuals. However, soup and salad will be served for assumed 2 individuals. 

Combo includes: 
14 Salmon Sashimi - Freshly Cut, buttery salmon which tastes amazing with or without soy sauce / Wasabi.

12 sushi pieces - ymmv. We received 4 torched salmon, 4 char roe, and 4 salmon sushi. The torched salmon was a nice touch, but the char roe sushi takes the cake with the flavor overwhelming your taste buds if not taken in small bites. Recommend combining with other things on the platter. 

Salmon Festival Roll - deep fried shrimp tempura, cucumber, avacado, and imitation crab meat topped with torched salmon and char roe. Lightly sauced. Combination of these items tasted well and the char roe added that extra flavor when they pop. Tempura could have been more crispy which would have added to the overall bite of the roll. 

Salmon and Salmon skin tempura with homemade spicy sauce. The homemade spicy sauce was not too strong but that was perfect for matching the salmon sashimi bits. The salmon skin tempura could have been more crispy but over time the sauce will soak into the skin bits. However the overall taste was well received. 

6 piece spicy salmon roll - they did not serve this item today but rather substituted their roll with an assortment of other rolls including standard spicy tuna, cucumber and california roll. We didn't catch this until after we looked back at the menu again. But regardless the rolls still tasted good. Point loss for not sticking to the menu. 

Comes with choice of spicy salmon or crunchy salmon roll. Total of 2. As well as choice of seaweed or green salad. Total of 2. And 2 ice creams. If ice cream is out, they will substitute will yogurt drink.

The seaweed salad was quite refreshing while the green salad was fairly standard. The spicy salmon roll was filled all the way throughout the roll and so you can finish the roll without running out of salmon. 

Portion size was very large and more than enough food for 2 people.

Staff was very friendly and answered questions happily, but with only 1 staff member serving customers. The store itself only seats about 30 at most and is maintained well. Staff will go around and pour tea for you and refill it as needed. They can be found fairly easily but may get overwhelmed if busy. 

Environment Rating - 3 / 5
The store itself faces the street versus the parking lot so it's easy to miss. They do their best to maintain the cleanliness and extra attention is paid to their washroom facilities to keep it as clean as possible. Nice touch on using a screen to hide cleaning supplies. However given the age of the store, the facilities are not as up to date or as clean as it could be. 

Price Rating - 3 / 5
Price after tax   - $75.00 for the combo which could have fed 3 people. If you compare it to an all you can eat restaurant, it is expensive, however for fresh and authentic experience this is a standard price point."}
{"text":"I've always been there only for dinner and I love it! I'm not a big fan of all you can eat sushi because I always feel like I should stuff myself till I can't take it anymore to make sure what I paid for is 'used up', but if I do that it's like torturing myself. I love Sapporo Sushi's bento boxes. They have approx. 10 different kinds of bento boxes and they all come with soup, salad, and ice cream (which most Japanese restaurants don't serve with bento boxes). The best thing is, all their bento boxes are priced at an affordable price. I've had bad experiences where food were overly priced and quality was horrible. However, not only is Sapporo Sushi's prices are reasonable, their quality is also very good too. Their service is great, but can be a bit slow due to their limited servers. Not once have I been there and it's not packed, so get there early or prepare to wait a bit."}
{"text":"This is an awesome family-run restaurant. I loved the sashimi and the miso soup was great too! The food is fresh and quick. I had a great experience! Thank you Sapporo Sushi!"}
{"text":"Generally good sushi and sushi roll selections. They also are pretty lenient about substitutions, and if you order a meal you often get side items (salad and soup) with it.

Just a note, do not get their hot pots, at $28.91 you get 2 udon noodles and scraps of meat, some processed meat (i think it was 2-3 fish ball type meat in slices), and 2 shrimps. It's suppose to serve 2, but it is still essentially a rip off, for the amount of food you get (mostly noodles). You are better off ordering noodles at Ajisen down the street (and I don't even like Ajisen)."}
{"text":"This is conveniently close to work and one of the better sushi places in the area.  Their sashimi is fresh and served at the perfect temperature.  Service is quick and friendly... they even have a little 'buzzer button' contraption at each table should you require immediate assistance.

They have a good lunch menu selection with all your typical favourites.  The last time I ordered rolls there though (I think it was red dragon), they were so big that I found them almost to be 'two-biters' which isn't very graceful, if you know what I mean.

It's not the cheapest place around but we're talking about sushi here... you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their double dragon bento. I was already suspicious when they listed $12.95 for a red + black dragon roll. That's like BOGO free! but I tried it anyways. Bad choice. 

The pieces of maki were smaller than a toonie (no wonder it's cheap!). The salmon tasted bland and the fillings were mushy. The \"sushi rice\" was also like milled rice (rough texture). An amateur could have made this. Worse still, there were dabs of water on the bento which didn't seem sanitizing. 

This place does not have quantity or quality. With the number of sushi joints around, I will not be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this restaurant yesterday and I have to say this place is great! I had their \"super sashimi\" bento and the rest had the salmon sashimi bento. The fish was really fresh- especially the the toro and salmon sashimi. 
The only downside was they did not have the sea urchin sashimi in stock and i had to substitute with something else- I chose ika (squid), but I was disappointed with how small the pieces were. Needless to say everything else tasted great and the portions were just right. If only Mississauga had this place.

Also another note, the restaurant is quite small so I recommend going early if you are a big group."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight. My first time here. This place is alright. Nothing amazing in my opinion but it was not bad either. Prices are reasonable for a Japanese Restaurant of average quality. I wouldn't travel far for this restaurant. Come if you are in the area and want some relatively cheap sushi."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch not too long ago, and while the bento box was of good quality, the wait time was not so fabulous. 

If you're in a hurry try another spot, or you'll be left waiting about 20 minutes for your order."}
{"text":"We called ahead and got an order to go.  A female in the office has been here before and raved about it.  Took a later lunch as she said its packed around lunchtime.  While we walked in this awful Cleveland weather there doesnt seem to be any parking as it's on a side street by a bar called Moriarties Pub.  Unless you walk for lunch...no way you are driving here.  This place is TINY inside....according to another person whos been here before, you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom......Very very small dining room.  We didnt eat here and I dont think I would want to.  A little too cozy for mebroom closet cozy...I will say the food was very very good...the weather helped keep the sushi cold for the walk back"}
{"text":"The place has good flavors but the portions are a bit on the small side given the quality of the sushi. Really enjoyed on the a la carte sushi sets that came with 15 pieces of sashimi on the side."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation of the other reviews but I was tremendously disappointed in the sushi. They were quite busy and the service was excellent but the food was far from great!

We had tuna sashimi and it was a completely washed out colour (which usually isn't good for tuna) and as for the hand rolls, AVOID the Toronto Roll. They put a chunk of Philadelphia cream cheese (Full fat too, yes I know the taste!) in there and that's ALL you taste! We also had the Mountain (might be Volcano or other) and it was again tasteless.

The only part that was good about this restaurant was that we were surprised with soup, salad, and 2 side dishes and finally with ice cream. Usually in other \"Japanese\" (I can't really call this place Japanese since it's run by Koreans) places, you only get soup, salad and ice cream with bento boxes or special set dinners.

Either way I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here since it first opened.  The latest Reno makes it look awesome.  Highly recommended any time of day. Good deals and they give appetizers (salad, miso soup, tempura tofu and sometimes other little treats)."}
{"text":"This tiny little sushi bar is not a place to miss for true sushi fans.  The sashimi was the freshest I've ever had and they had lots of creative rolls.  The staff was super friendly and the prices were about average.  I usually feel let down by sushi restaurants in the Toronto area but this place has given me hope.  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  They have good-priced combos with the salmon combo and bulgogi combos being my favourites.  Got takeout once and they included the extras (minus ice cream) that you normally get when dining in.
The service has also always been friendly."}
{"text":"I came her with a friend (new nickname alert: the CUTE! Chinese girl) and I'm still quite satisfied with the sushi but the CUTE! Chinese girl really didn't seem to like it. I only post this to echo Bijan's review. The sushi may not be to everyone's taste. But for my part, I find it very nice. Service is typically excellent. We had two people keeping tabs on our table. They have a modified Korean \"ban chan\" type serving that comes with your sushi platter. An unusual touch. We had a baked salmon with lemon and soy. It was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent and fresh ingredients, make this a must go to for tasty sushi.  Staff is friendly, but restaurant is a little small."}
{"text":"I ordered the double dragon bento lunch special. It was fantastic, and came with miso soup and a spicy crispy salmon hand roll. The portion was quite large, and the fish was very, very fresh. There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant (which is quite small) but the food came very fast.

This place was quite full for a weekday lunch, but it's definitely a great spot and I would come back!"}
{"text":"Not usually one to write a bad review, but this experience has been particularly disappointing for me as someone who has been coming to Sapporo for years upon years. Until tonight, I have always found they serve fresh fish at great prices for the portion. The double dragon bento special is my usual go-to. Tonight I got pick up and came home to find the black dragon roll had barely an eel on it (see photo for reference). When I went to try a piece, it fell apart as I tried to pick it up. The red dragon roll also was falling apart as I picked it up. I'm hoping this is just a one-off and doesn't become the usual; maybe they are under new ownership or got a new chef."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come to eat here fairly often since she lives close by.  The food is always great; we've never been disappointed.  \"What would you like for dinner?\" This is always one of the first places that comes to my mind.  I've found that ordering an appetizer and a special roll will fill you up completely.  I especially recommend the spicy sashimi salad.  The employees are always friendly and the place itself is very cozy.  The restaurant is fairly small but makes for an intimate meal.  Coming here with a small group of people is nice.
One of the best sushi places I've ever been to.  This should definitely be on your list of places to check out."}
{"text":"CLEVELAND, OH: Had a great lunch at Sapporo.  A client brought me here for a lunch meeting and the wait wasn't bad (many reviewers had commented about this), but we came at 11:30 and beat the rush.

I don't remember the names of the rolls we got, there were several.  All were generously prepared, fresh and flavorful.  The service was friendly as well.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place used to be good... 
For 2 people we ordered the joyful set (sushi, sashimi, Miso soup, green salad, ice cream...all combos come with it even though the menu might not list it which is a little misleading)  & added an order of tempura... In my opinion I think the individual combos might have better deal than the 2 person sets.

 Salmon sashimi was okay... Other fish could definitely be fresher.  
For this price I can eat AYCE and have better quality and variety.  Quality wasn't that great...  Mmm really nothing positive to say about my visit... Just know that I won't be returning..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Usually pretty packed. Almost all of their special sushi rolls are amazing. 
Service is okay, they have a cute little bell attached to each table so you don't have to wave down the waitress."}
{"text":"I'm so grateful my friend introduced me to this place. It's somewhat hidden in the plaza as it is not facing any of the parking spots. You have to walk towards a side pathway to get to the restaurant. However, I would say this restaurant is definitely worth it especially the price. I consider the price to be lower compared to most other sushi restaurants I've been to, and what you pay for is worth the price. 

There are weekly specials you can choose from if you take a look at the wall. However, I would suggest going for the bento box menu specials on the last page of the menu. The double dragon bento box is definitely one of the best deals and I would recommend it.

The only negative is the place is small so the tables are seated pretty close to each other not giving much privacy for conversation."}
{"text":"My favorite place for quality shashimi and sushi. Have come here several times before and the fish is always fresh and tasty. I like that they don't douse their miso soup with salt or MSG. Service is quick, polite and efficient without being rushed. Had the lunch special 1 and 2 and walked out with everything at $25, which includes the miso soup, salad and green tea ice cream.  Will definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"We have been going here for almost 7 years now. We used to live close by, and when we moved to Aurora, we still go here at least 1or 2 times a week. We believe it is worth the drive. The spicy salmon hand roll is what keeps us coming back, and not to mention, their salmon sashimi is always fresh."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a few other reviews here.  Sushi isn't too bad.  Seems like a family run place, which is probably the root of the only real problem I had.  SLOOOOOOOW.  Mom handles the phones and the floor, dad's in back making the food.  No sense of urgency, that's for sure.  I ordered takeout and was told it would be ready in 45 min.  Ok, that's pretty long, but no biggie.  I can leave my office at any time.  I get there and spend another 20 minutes standing there waiting for my rolls to be made.  There were 3 tables seated at the time!  They need to walk down the street to Sushi 86 to see a few chefs flying through orders under a crush!

Beyond the wait, the food was actually pretty good.  Everything was fresh and flavorful, which is really all I'm looking for in a sushi place.  Give me fresh over some wacky combination of ingredients any time."}
{"text":"Sapporo situates in a popular mall, unfortunately, its storefront and entrance are not visible from the busy parking lot.  I only know of its existence because its storefront faces a side street that I use to enter the mall.  I have been curious about how it has survived the disadvantage for so long.

Upon entry, we were welcomed by an ambiance that signified that it was a neighborhood restaurant from older times.  We ordered a sushi set and an udon noodle stir fry.  The sushi were sufficiently fresh.  The sushi set had good fishes selection, including more expensive ingredients such as scallop and salmon roes.  The fish selection set Sapporo apart from the lower tiered sushi joints that served the same selection as the AYCE sushi places.  The udon stir fry was well-portioned.  It was a good choice for sharing.

The services were good and courteous.

I like Sapporo Sushi.  It doesn't try to earn your money with decoration.  Instead, it focuses on the food quality and on providing good value on food and services."}
{"text":"I've only ordered takeout. 

The salmon sashimi bento was fresh and a decent portion.  Service takes a while but they gave fair warning of how long it will take and it was ready around the quoted time."}
{"text":"Amazing prices and amazing quality! The only thing is when they are busy the service can be a little slow! Over all one of my favorite sushi in Richmond hill!

Love their Bento Special they are all between 10.95-12.95! Each of these bento specials come with either a crispy or spicy salmon hand roll, miso soup, salad and ice cream! Their sashimi are always fresh because they are a small restaurant and hav high turn overs. My fav is their salmon bento!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, the sushi here is still amazing...still fresh, the portions are still generous, the service is still super friendly.  I'll never stop ordering my sushi lunches from Sapporo.  My favorites are the Salmon Skin Roll (might even be better than Ginko's), Tuna Roll and any of the Sashimi (especially the White Tuna/Escolar).  You can order online through Yelp, which makes things easier and more convenient."}
{"text":"Small and cozy little Japanese restaurant. Came here wanting to eat some kind of bento box. Is there such thing as a bento box craving? lol. I didnt't really like the options for their bento box menu. I think someone should come out with a restaurant that has custom bento box options. Anyway.......

Salmon teriyaki $13.95 - parts of the salmon was a bit dry but still tasted okay. Comes with salad, some sushi, and rice.

Tempura lunch special $11.95 - came with 2 shrimp tempura and some veggie tempura. Also came with salad, some sushi and 2 deep fried dumplings. Everything tasted okay.

Both meals come with miso soup and green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I visited for lunch (some of their lunch specials are fantastic), and miso soup + green tea ice cream came with the meal. Most notably, Sapporo Sushi serves giant, fresh cuts of salmon sashimi. My go-to is the lunch special #3. While portions and pricing are fair, the seating is disappointing because of the small space. I also have to mention this: when the server heard that it was my first time there, the chef made complimentary hand rolls for my entire table. Really won me over :) I definitely recommend Sapporo Sushi!"}
{"text":"A MUST GO TO!!!! This is one of my favourite sushi places in the Richmond Hill area. This is simply because there is hardly a wait time, all the staff have been super sweet and friendly, food is always consistent and the prices are so fair. It is such a hole in the wall place to eat at and you should go!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and take out!
Good quality sushi and they don't skimp! 
Great value on lunch specials.
Though the venue is a bit cramped, the service is always good and the chef is very friendly.
My coworker and I go there for lunch every time we get a chance to get out of the office."}
{"text":"I came here probably a year or two ago and remember it being really good. However, today was probably a one off, because the food was not very good. 

The two of us came a little past 1 pm on a Friday. It's a small restaurant, and it was a quarter packed. There were two chefs, and one waitress. The menu is decently priced and affordable, and there are also weekday specials from Monday to Thursday.  My friend ordered lunch special 1 bento box, and I ordered lunch special 3 with sashimi.  The miso soup that came with the meal was very diluted, and there wasn't any taste. The salad, was very vinegary tasting. I am usually fond of salad, but I couldn't even touch my friends salad. 

I was hoping this was a one off until the food arrived.  The salmon was decent, and tasted fine.  However the fried stuff on my platter was terribly awful.  The filling in my gyoza tasted like it was going bad, and tasted a day old. I thought it was just one gyoza, but the second one had even a stronger taste of it going bad.  The shrimp in my dynamite roll tasted like it had been fried yesterday, and was soggy tasting, and not crispy whatsoever. The only good thing about this whole meal was salmon sashimi and the tea. There was also no ice cream served after our meal as mentioned in other reviews.  The restaurant was aware of my concern, but only mentioned that they would look into the food. 

I'm really hoping this whole situation was a one off, considering that the last time was much better."}
{"text":"Me and my cousin went for lunch here, since we live around the area and we didn't want all you can eat but I was craving sashimi, and my cousin had mentioned to come here because he had came here before so I decided to give it try go and try out the place. 

The place is pretty small and cannot be seen from highway 7. You have to turn down a small street into the plaza in order to get there. First impression, of this place was it  was very nice and the I really liked that they had daily specials for maki rolls. If I remember I had gone on a Wednesday and they have $1 off for certain maki rolls and $2 off for other ones. Me and cousin both ordered the same sashimi bento box which was very good. The quality that was given was a good amount of food and lots of pieces of sashimi as well. 

We had also ordered some maki rolls from the daily special menu to go with our bento box. After devouring everything I was very satisfied with the meal. The fish was very fresh, the maki rolls were pretty good as well. Decent is a way I would put it. Overall, it was a good first time experience and I would definitely go back again in the future."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this place.  Amazing prices, very fresh sushi.  It's a very small restaurant but makes for up for it in the quality and prices!  Definitely on my new list of must visit sushi restaurants in Richmond Hill.  Ordered the salmon bento with two other rolls (Yam roll and Futomaki).  I could barely finish it all and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was!"}
{"text":"This would be my fourth time here.  It was recommended by my best friend after she was introduced by another friend of ours.  So as you can see, this place gets noticed by word of mouth.  Friendly service.  No matter what you order, they give you soup and ice cream all the time to complete your meal.  I ordered the sushi, sashimi and maki dinner package.  The dinner was only $12.95 plus taxes and grat.  The fish is fresh all the time.  Prices are very affordable and the portions are very generous.  I think the only downfall would be how thick they slice their sashimi.  But I guess its just personal preference.  This is the perfect place for those who can never make AYCE worth it (like me).  The space is small and quaint so bringing big groups in there wouldn't be a good idea but this is definitely my go-to place for sushi with a few friends."}
{"text":"I'm dropping one star after today's experience.

A few things of note if you're visiting here: Give yourself at least 45 minutes of lunch time if you're planning to order something not from the sushi menu. There is usually only a single person working the donburi and udon meals, so it won't be a walk in the park in terms of getting those foods as quick as possible.

The udon here I do not recommend, at least from the bowl I had today, as the noodles were overcooked and too mushy. For $11 minimum I would say it's not worth the investment.

I also ordered the Las Vegas Roll, and I must say it was the first time I was offered the rolls menu out of the 3 visits here so far. The rolls took a good 30 minutes to be made after ordering, and similarly I found the rice a little bit on the mushy side. The fish ingredients inside were all excellent, but the roll itself unfortunately fell apart a little too easily.

If you stick with the sushi/sashimi, your experience here should still be good. However I will drop one star from this restaurant as the kitchen stuff leaves a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Salomon teriyaki is perfect with a reasonable price. Especially at Monday. Rolls are amazing too. Waitress and chef look kind and polite."}
{"text":"Great service, small restaurant and gets filled quickly during dinner time (6-7). Fish was fresh and enjoyed our meal. Miso soup wasn't a favourite but the rice tea was delicious"}
{"text":"Cozy family run restaurant with friendly service and quality food. There are only 8 tables and we arrived right in time to fill the last table. Customers appeared as regulars, as they were quite talkative with the staff. Mom and Dad prepared the food, their son helped in and out of the kitchen, and their daughter served and handled payments. Great working team! We had the Sapporo Combo (16.95) and Salmon bento (11.95). Both were very filling for a great price."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????Service???????????????????presentation?????????Bento box???????????????????????specialty sushi rolls????????????????????????.....???????????"}
{"text":"Food and price is okay but that's where it ends. I used to call EVERY single Saturday consistently to order the EXACT same platter. They should have known by heart when I'll be calling in. Instead they tell me it'll take an hour to make and lately they've been telling me they're too busy and can't take anymore orders.  That's where my patience ended. Since they literally told me they're too busy for my business, then I'm taking my money else where. And no, this is not a rare occasion, this happened to me 4 times and once I even told them my situation on the phone and next week I once again got the same response.  Not worth my time anymore!"}
{"text":"Good cheap Chinese food is easy to get in Cleveland. But it doesn't translate into Japanese. Warning to all locals who think this is representative sushi. It is not. It gets much better than this. 

Not much to say. Overpriced, mediocre sushi in a joint with no atmosphere. I recommend it only if you are absolutely craving for sashimi, which is decent."}
{"text":"Best sushi pizza I've ever tasted!  Usually sushi pizza tastes like burnt rice to me, but this one was not too over fried and nice and golden.  They also loaded it with lots of toppings - just make sure they go light on the mayo.  I highly recommend it!

I tried their salmon bento and was really impressed that they had a box with a wide variety of items that were salmon-based since that's my favourite sushi fish.  It hit exactly the right spot!  Their white tuna was also the best I've ever tasted even though white tuna normally tastes like a wet sponge to me.  I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the food here.  I just wished the place wasn't so small and cramped.  Not recommended for large groups."}
{"text":"My experience here wasn't as good as other yelpers. My salmon sashimi wasn't melt in your mouth goodness and the cut wasn't that great. Not only that I find it hard to chew through the sashimi and it tasted fishy. The rolls weren't well wrapped so it was falling apart. The unagi sushi also feel apart when I picked it up, half of the rice ended up in the sauce plate. The salad had no taste because it wasn't drained properly so it was still swimming in its own washing water. The only good thing was the miso soup since it came out piping hot. Service was soso as the owners and the workers were talking extremely loudly and it was bothersome because it was such a small place. I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi downtown. As other reviewers mentioned, the place is postage-stamp tiny, but i can always take it back to the office or to the library reading garden in nice weather. Lunches are usually crowded, but I get around that by calling before noon and picking it up. The chef's a little on the slow side, but I like his attention to detail.

They have a great variety of maki, hand rolls, and some big rolls with all sorts of fancy stuff. Everything I've tried is fresh and tasty. I'm partial to the Alaska maki, which comes with generous portions of salmon and avocado. I always get the seaweed salad, too. It's pricey, but I'm not about to go out and harvest my own seaweed, so I'll happily pay someone to make it for me. Great complement to the sushi."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this restaurant for years and it has always been a great experience. The owner & waitresses are friendly & attentive, and their fish is always fresh. Decent prices and good service!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great for it's price. I'm amazed. Same concept as gals sushi.  Cheap mediocore sushi but better I would say. Better than ichiban sushi house too.  however, a very small place. and decor bland. was not busy when we went.

there was so much awesome selection combos, specials and a la carte items possible. great service who don't hover but kept an eye out on us if we needed them.

I ordered dinner special one. Comes with soup, salad, 12 pc sashimi, 4pc sushi, 6 rolls and one spicy crunchy tuna Hand roll all for 8 95. Albeit everything was on the smaller side, it is well worth the variety.  Also had the two dragon roll set for 10 95.  Both with ice cream  All so awesome. I would come back again and highly recommend this place. at least try it once as you won't be let down.

Debit and cash only.  btw, funny the menu cover says tuesday closed and a sign on the wall shows there's tuesday salmon specials. :)"}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING! Chicken teryaki was COLD! Made of COLD cuts of chicken. It was as if they used STALE bits from a whole chicken bought from the grocery store! DISGUSTING AND COLD! 

Spicy Salmon rolls were spiced with Sriracha hot sauce! Barely a crumb of salmon!

Miso soup had NO tofu and NO seaweed! This place was dead for lunch hour. 

UGLY pigeon-hole interior. 

AVOID this place! This is not a place for those who want to experience REAL Japanese food (upscale places RUN by JAPANESE OWNERS in downtown Toronto). 

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST."}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed with this place.

I went here with my bachelor party for dinner and I wasn't too pleased with it. The decor was great and the atmosphere let's say was \"jumpin' \". We were seated and it was cramped and I didn't have that much room to work with when we were eating. we were all knocking things over and spilling glasses because we were seated in a cramped area.

The service was slow. It took a while for us to place our orders and the bill as well. I ordered things that never made it to the table and one of my groomsmen had to order a glass of water 3 times before it made it to the table.

The food was a bit unique for a sushi place. It came with complimentary soup (i think) which was nice and the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box came dry and unappetizing. 

It's not all bad. the design and decor bring up some of the faults of this place but it doesn't work on many others to make it a place I'd want to go back to in the future."}
{"text":"I thought this place was just okay. Service is definitely not fast -- when the restaurant gets slammed with a lunchtime rush it can take a while for orders to get filled. 

In the end, the sushi itself is not really much to write home about -- certainly not worth a long wait, as it's not the best I've had in Cleveland. I think a big part of the problem is there's one dude making the sushi and a lunch rush is just a bit too much for one person to handle."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp - it was the highest rated sushi place around hwy 7 and Yonge.

The atmosphere is very authentic japanese.. Give you that right feeling when you walk in to a place (proper) ... It kind of reminded me of Japango downtown Toronto (Bay and Dundas) for those of you who have not been to Japango, I strongly recommend you try it out. 

Back to Sopporo... We ordered 2 plates (1 sashimi and 1 sushi) with some rolls...
Sashimi - melts in your mouth, that's how good they are.

Sushi and the rolls are top quality too.. And including the price parameter I can not give this place anything lower than a 5.

It satisfies any sushi/sashimi lovers."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  My regular spots were Tomo, MiNe, and Ichiban and wanted to try some new spots and boy was I wrong!  After seeing the 4 stars and read a bit of the positive reviews I decided to give it a try  for a take out party platter.    I ordered the premium sushi platter $60 as I wanted a better selection of fish.   I would not call their sushi sushi but more like sushi bites.  The sushi pieces were so small like the size of my pinky.  In the sushi selection there were tuna, shrimp, salmon, white tuna, and tamago.  How is this premium sushi platter ?  I had hoped there were some yellow tail,  ika, and mackeral but there wasn't.  The rolls were just regular and nothing special (cali roll, tuna roll).    The rice was a bit hard and not enough vinegar.  The rice tasted  more like the rice I cook at home (non-sushi).  I  rechecked the reviews and the ones that gave poor marks were more inline with what I am writing now.  There were 2 reviewers that gave positive 5 stars and that was the only review from those people so you probably would know (it's their own family/friends to bump up the average).   Would definitely not recommend and go back as there's tons of much better sushi spots.  From now on I'll just stick with what you know.    The 1 star is for the smiling happy boss who's probably saying in his head \"fished another sucker\" !  You have been forewarned, Beware!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed food but I had bad customer service no bigger she was only human and seemed to be having a bad day. But my visit would have been a 5 star with good customer service"}
{"text":"I heard of this place and it's an hidden gem! Located east of Bayview on hwy 7. The place is very small with about 6 tables at most but the sushi rolls are delicious! They have several lunch and dinner specials and theirs prices are lower than average but that doesn't reflect on the food. A must try place!"}
{"text":"Still a good location to eat since it's near the office. I shared the Sushi combo with a co-worker & while it was good, it wasn't great.  I have to try my old favourite (the Jay roll) to really compare if the quality is the same or not.  Service is still good. This place gets busy during weekdays at lunch time. So if you want a table fast it's best to go a bit before 12pm."}
{"text":"Got this for delivered for lunch today, I admit I am not a great person to speak about the quality of the sushi as I always order vegetarian sushi but, that being said, the sushi I got was excellent. I got the avocado maki, cucumber maki and carrot maki. Super yummy and extremely reasonably priced. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Had take out lunch today, double dragon and salmon bento 12.95 for each combo. Sashimi was very fresh and generous cuts too. Miso was good/typical but salad was lacking, iceberg end cuts, sushi rice was right taste and texture. I would go back soon for lunch again, good value for money.
No tax if paid with cash!"}
{"text":"SERVICE: exceptionally friendly and courteous service. No complaints whatsoever.

FOOD: the quality of food was so-so. The ratio of value for the money is not there for me. I found the food bland in taste. Next time, I'd much rather go to Akane Sushi on the same plaza where I can get better for the money. I suppose, given the price range and quality of ingredients, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Tried it today! I was pleasantly surprised with a few things. Namely the quality of food was great: salmon sushi tasted great, awesome hand roll spicy and crunchy, tea and beer and complimentary ice cream. One waitress was cute, added factor for guys, nice atmosphere. Only negative was the size since I think only 15-20 capacity which had a couple people waiting at times. But not too long. 

I recommend."}
{"text":"The woman who works there is so sweet. We were waiting a while since she was the only one serving. She apologized and gave me my edamame for free. She even gave us a delicious little yogurt drink and candy! Really good sushi as well. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I think this is some of the best sushi in Northeast Ohio. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious. I feel some places have sushi that is too small or use too much rice as filler, but not here. They're also open until 7pm or so during the week so you can eat in or get something to go after work. 

The atmosphere is nothing to speak of. No alcohol. But you can watch them make your sushi at the sushi bar. 

Service can be slow when they're busy. (Fridays at lunch) I've only seen two people working there at one time - one serves while one makes the sushi. And the guy who makes the sushi is very slow and meticulous. But the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best quality cheap sushi i've ever had in toronto.

The $10 bento box comes with a spicy salmon handroll, large pieces of salmon sashimi, three spicy salmon maki, and three california maki, and three eel sushi. It is SO worth it. Comes with miso soup and salad too. It takes two people to finish it and it is sooo delicious. Best spicy salmon handroll i've ever had in my entire life. This is available for lunch and dinner too!

If you wanna order takeout, call ahead and it will eliminate your wait. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a regular here. I come here for takeout sushi for a lazy night in, or meeting up with a small group of friends for dinner. The key word here is \"small\". Small space, and small number of staff. There's usually only 1 waitress for the whole restaurant to take orders, deliver food, get the bill. It works out 4 out of 5 times, but there was one time when I was made to wait for almost 1 hour for my order. Of course, the staff more than made it up by bringing an extra, on-the-house bento meal.
 
Overall, I'm always pleased with the freshness and the staff friendliness. Will continue going back every 2 weeks, as my custom is now!"}
{"text":"Had a 24 dollar Bento set to go. It was super super bad. They didn't provide any wasabi. One piece of the uni sushi was super bitter. I have never seen a hand roll so small. It should really be called a finger roll. The miso soup tasted like water with a bit of salt. The best part of the entire meal was the salad. I would give this a massive miss."}
{"text":"If you want friendly fast service, don't go there, lol. I'm a salmon sashimi junkie and every single time I've ordered, it is amazingly fresh. It's a tiny place, so I wouldn't describe it as a date place. Their salmon is sooo good and fresh, and any sushi rolls are awesome with great attention to detail to the rice. PS - service is slow as well, but it's soo worth ordering take out from there!"}
{"text":"Okay the sushi here is legitimately good! I have been to too many sushi places in the GTA to count and most of them are average at best. My friend took me here one day and I was thoroughly impressed. 

At first, it seems like a really small restaurant hidden on the side of a plaza but once you're inside everything exceeds your expectations. Yes, the inside is small, I don't think they can accommodate more than 20 people but the food makes this little place a hidden gem in the GTA :)

Sushi is always fresh and delicious and serving sizes are perfect. Their bento boxes are really good and I really like their dragon rolls."}
{"text":"I did not expect this.

Absolutely winging it with a quick Yelp search, I whatever-d it this day. \"Uptown, uptown, something, something, sushi. Let's just do it\". But, like they say, you find love when you're not looking, right? My expectations may have been at an all-time low, but, I loved it all!

It was between 11:30~3PM! So we took advantage of their lunch specials.

We got:
- \"Lunch Special 3\" ($8.95) 6pcs Roll, 3pcs Sashimi &3 pcs Sushi
- \"Lunch Special 1\"  ($8.95) 9pcs Sashimi; 4pcs Sushi & 3pcs Roll
- Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab ($9.95)

It was super fresh and the pieces of Sashimi absolutely melted in my mouth. I enjoyed every delicious bite of it! The Soft Shell Crab is a no-go though - it's sad and scrawny. 

Word is... there are Weekly Specials!!! 
(12~3PM):
- Mondays are Teriyaki specials (save $1!)
- Tuesdays are Salmon specials - 15pcs OR a Salmon Sushi set for $8.95
- Wednesdays are Roll specials ($1~2 off)
- Thursdays are Udon specials ($1~2 off)

We were already finishing off on such a great note, then they proceeded to serve us up with two *free* hand rolls and delicious green tea ice cream! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Owners are Korean couple. Their sushi are westernized but tasty. All the rolls are big! Recommend their pink salmon and rainbows  rolls"}
{"text":"This is a nice little cozy restaurant for an off work weekday lunch, lazy weekend lunch, or regular evening takeout. It is open 7 days a week, for lunch and dinner, but the above mentioned times are when I usually come to eat. The place sits about 25 people, so if you have a big group, you might not want to consider this place.

The lunch specials are pretty good and the fish are pretty fresh too. For the price you are paying, you are getting a very good value in quality and portion."}
{"text":"Ok, the wait this time was decent despite a packed house.  I went at 12:45, so perhaps that made the difference.  Back to 3 stars.

We split a dragon roll,  a spicy salmon roll and a crab salad roll.  So sue us, we were hungry.  

The eel on the dragon roll was really good this time-- fresh and moist.  The salmon was fantastic-- really fresh, high quality, vibrant and buttery.  Points for drsssing the salmon so it lacked any of those tough stringy things.  You know what I'm talking about.  Those things completely ruin a bite of sushi for me.  The edamame were slightly overcooked.  Like I said, we were hungry.  

If the quality remains this high consistently, they will remain in my good graces.  And isn't that what everyone wants?"}
{"text":"Sapporo Sushi was not good on my most recent visit.

The Bento Sashimi and Sushi ($14.95) was really really bad... The sushi are so small like miniatures and the rice was hard and chewy!

When I saw the Beef Teriyaki ($8.95), I could not stop laughing as they were just cold beef reheated slightly on a table grill.. they were cold, tasteless and chewy, great with the cold and hard rice on the side.

I guess I am not coming back any time soon...."}
{"text":"This is some of my favorite sushi ever - and I absolutely love the sweet lady who runs the place during lunch. I agree with some of the other reviews that it definitely takes a little longer to get your order than the average place, but the food has always been absolutely delicious. So by the time you eat your delicious sushi and maki rolls, the long wait is already forgotten. 

My favorite item is probably the kane-su: a riceless cucumber and crab roll with sweet vinegar drizzled on top. Yum!"}
{"text":"I literally live on the same street as Sapporo sushi in a Condo so my 4 stars is given that this is the best sushi place in the area (by that I mean within walking distance). I lived in Tokyo for 7 years, so on that level it would not be 4 stars, but for Yonge/Finch most definitely. 

I have always had very good service when visiting Sapporo sushi and they prepare their take-out quite quickly too. They do have bells to ring when you are in the booths so do ring them. This is Korean/Japanese style and some I think expect the servers to come by right away, but they are probably waiting for you to ring the bell. 

Anyways, my favorite roll is the Red Dragon Roll, but their sashimi has always been pretty good. The only roll I'd avoid is any of the spicy rolls which seems to be the norm for Toronto period. In Vancouver, they give you a piece of fish with the spicy part on top or in its own place in the roll... In Toronto it is too common to mix the sauce and minced fish which is obviously a way to \"hide\" the less fresh fish - so don't recommend that here.... 

Love that they give me miso and salad when I order a roll even for take out and even more importantly, love that they have some Korean dishes so me and my girl can go there more often since she tires of sushi quite easily!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time, I usually order the take out for special evenings at home and the food has always been good. This isn't a high end place nor is it anything special but if you live around the area and don't feel like AYCE sushi this place is fine. But there are better places. 
Side note: it's a Korean operated restaurant that has pretty good Korean dishes. I love their japchae"}
{"text":"Sushi in Downtown is pretty easy to come by with quite a few places within walking distance of East 9th.  I don't partially think the sushi here is anything to write home about especially with Ginzu right down the street.  It's an easy spot to stop by for take out but too small to really eat inside unless you are a small party and go in off peak hours.  I've done both take out which was fine and eat in which took way way too long for sushi, so long in fact they sent over complimentary edamame for the wait.
Overall, if you are by this sushi joint pop in for some take out but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here when there are better places around."}
{"text":"This place is great value for money, though quality is a bit lacking.  I went for dinner and got the Double Dragon Bento ($12.95), which had a black dragon & a red dragon roll. Another in our party got the Super Bento ($16.95) which had sashimi, sushi, and rolls. Both bentos included miso soup, a spicy or crispy handroll (I got spicy salmon), salad, and green tea ice cream. For dinner at a sushi place - these were a great deal. 

The place is quite small. When I went there was only 1 waitress working and had to attend to all the tables. While she was nice and the service was fine, it was a bit slow.

Taste:  2/5
Service: 2/5
Atmosphere: 2/5
Value for Money: 5/5
Would I come again: No, there are other sushi places around"}
{"text":"Friendly family run restaurant , top quality sushi and good service. It's a tiny place so it can get pretty crowded during dinner hours, so come early. 
Good place for a quick bite, not a good place to sit and hang out. 
They give you free green tea ice cream at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Place is dirty.  As soon as you go in, you are standing on a muddy mat at the entrance.  I took a sip of the miso soup.  Wondered if it is safe to put my mouth on that miso bowl. Have they hand wash all their dishes and not in hot water dishwasher?  Bento box was wet. Sashimi thinly sliced. Sushi and maki below standard.  The reviews or 4 stars made me come here. This place is not 4 stars.  Not coming back again!"}
{"text":"Always has fresh sushi and the service is good. Limited spots to sit but never had to wait. Their lunch specials are pretty cheap."}
{"text":"nice place for visit. Normal foods but serving fast (maybe I'm lucky)
Once of good choice at this area"}
{"text":"The sashimi I ordered for delivery was not very good. The tuna is warm, soggy and mushy. The soy sauce comes with seasame oil taste in it, really?
The spicy tuna roll is smaller than any other sushi places I ever been to.. and it's not even like the regular spicy tuna roll, where is the mayo ?
The tempura rolls are also not impressive ... ugh will not be returning... hope I don't get sick"}
{"text":"Japanese food is my favorite food, so I have been to numerous Japanese sushi bars when I used to live in LA and SF. When I moved to CLE, I could not find a place that was as good as sushi bars in Cali until I found Sapporo. 

Sapporo is a hidden gem. I was introduced to Sapporo by my friend. From the outside appearance, I did not have a high expectation. It is not definitely fancy type of restaurant. But, it has a cozy environment, where you can quietly enjoy your meal (the atmosphere is actually similar to typical sushi bar in Japan).

Dragon Rolls and Rainbow rolls are the best I have had. Perfectly cooked sushi rice and a perfect proportion of rice and fish. The unagi on top of Dragon rolls are huge, and every sushi and roll has very generous amount of fish and ingredients. The owner/chef may seem aloof, but he is very generous at heart. You will understand this when you order food from this. The roll and sushi are definitely different from 5 different well-known sushi places in Cleveland area. Also, This place does not use all kinds of sauces that dominate the taste of rolls. Overall, the price is a little lower than other sushi places. 

The owner's wife told us that they just started to serve udon (Japanese noodle soup), which is another exciting news."}
{"text":"I always recommend Sapporo sushi when friends are craving sushi in the area. This is my to go spot! Their service is friendly and attentive. The food is always...and I do mean always great quality. There has never been a time where I thought the quality or the quality was not sufficient. Everything is always so fresh. The dining area is always clean as well. It is a cozy restaurant and the seating is limited. If you are 6 or more people I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Served by the waitress with zero personality. Sushi & sashimi combo was mediocre. The tempura batter was thick and heavy. I did not enjoy the meal at all. There are tons of other sushi restaurants you can check-in, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here ever since 2010. They had the salmon bento for $9.95. Then it became $12, now $14.95. The food quality just doesn't go with the price they're charging now. I will be spending my money elsewhere. It's been good while it lasted."}
{"text":"Came to this place for dinner the other day with my friend, waitress was friendly, environment is not the prettiest, but sashimi was really fresh, well worth it. Will come back next time."}
{"text":"Small place to have sushi as they do not have many tables.  Their sushi is delicious, especially the spicy salmon roll.  They have affordable sushi sets."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I've either missed dinner or had a small dinner, which would usually be around 9:30-10pm. At that time of the night I don't usually feel like eating the cooked food. I usually go for a variety of rolls or some kinda sashimi. The sashimi has always been fresh when I come.
The one thing I do want to apologize to the owners of this restaurant for is the fact that I always come pretty late and sometimes I'm the last one eating there. But I'd like to thank them for staying open for me."}
