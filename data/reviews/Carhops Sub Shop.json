{"text":"Got the GTO and it was good. Nothing special.  Family split the Italian. The really liked it. Hot pepper relish was a good surprise. For a Saturday afternoon service wasn't the best buy we were not in a hurry."}
{"text":"as one other reviewer states,, the steak needs some season..or something..it was an ok sub with real meat..great boardwalk type fries.."}
{"text":"We are from Alabama and loved the Cheesesteaks here!! Laid back and great food! Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the subs but LOVE their pizza. I moved here from New York and have been supremely disappointed in what locals consider quality pizza. This place has huge slices and pies with tons of flavor. The employees are always friendly and the pizza hot. The best place for pizza in the Strip! The only drawback is they don't deliver."}
{"text":"I've tried nearly every PIzza in Pittsburgh and this was the worst. Grease on cardboard. I think this was the first pizza in my life that I couldn't finnish it was so bad. 

The man working there was rude as well barking at my \"what do you want\" and then throwing my change at me. 

Why eat somewhere so rude and gross when there are dozens of other amazing options on the strip?"}
{"text":"Seeing the signs for quite some time, we were glad to learn that Carhops is now open in their new Strip District location!  1806 Smallman St, in what used to be \"Bill's Produce\".  Same great menu, same great taste!"}
{"text":"Now I am a traveled man. I have eaten cheesesteaks in a lot if towns. Sorry guys but I think we all know that this particular sub is the ONE SINGLE THING Philly can ever claim to beat us at. I had Pat's and Geno's and they are on another level hands down. That being said, Carhops makes a damn good cheesesteak. 

The place is a Cadillac themed hole in the wall down in the strip district. I think its kinda cool; I love divey holes. Caddy grills and rims adorn the walls. Rough booths line the walls.  There is a small bar with a few standard domestic drafts and bottles. This is definitely a sub joint that sells beer rather than the other way around. 

The steaks themselves are pretty damn good. I often get the GTO (all the subs are named after cars) because the only thing better than a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak with bacon. A big part of what makes their steaks so good isn't just the premium beef they use, but the crusty chewy French bread the subs are served on.  The subs are served in 12\" and 24\" portions with the 24\" running about 20 bucks. For me the subs are a bit pricey but they are some of the best I've had in the burgh so I don't mind all that much. 

All in Carhops is a damn good cheesesteak joint. They provide an excellent change of pace from Primanti's right around the corner. Head down if you ever want a huge well done cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I love Carhops! I have been going there for years! They also have a location in Monroeville. 

They have hoagies, burgers, fries, wings ,salads sandwiches etc. Every hoagie is named after a car. You have two choices in sandwich sizes, coupe - 1ft and sedan - 2ft. They offer cheesesteaks, chicken, reubens and Italian subs.

I love their burgers too. All of which are named after Lamborghini's such as the Diablo, Countach, Espada, Muira and Jalpa. My favorite burger is the Jalpa. It consist of a cheeseburger with melted cheddar cheese and bacon and is outstanding!

There is also a full bar in the back.

Make sure you try the home made ice tea! It is outstanding!

Cash only!"}

{"text":"(11/11/2014)  Visited a friend in high style and needed some hangover food for lunch.  She loves the Carhops subs.  Meat is high quality, bread is fresh, French baguette, fluffy on the inside, crusty then chewy on the outside.  Lettuce was iceberg, tomatoes underripe, but hey, it's Pittsburgh in November.  It's a good sub, not a Philly cheesesteak, but a good fresh, tasty sub.  The coupe size is a foot-long, the sedan is 2.  The sheer length is impressive, but the bread's kinda skinny.  It's funny, if you browse the photos for Carhops from this site over the years, there's less and less meat pictured in the subs.  Times must be tough.  Still, a coupe was enough for me.  I had the Impala S/S, your basic cheesesteak with fried peppers, onions and cheese (it was stringy, not melty, I think it was provolone), add hot pepper rings and mayo.  Definitely hit the spot and price was right.  Conveniently in the Strip so you can get your grub on then do some walking."}
{"text":"excellent, excellent sandwiches.  almost too much food for a very low price.  corvette chicken FTW!!!"}
{"text":"Being a die hard foody and transplanted to the Burgh from N.J.and South Philly area I know good food, from the sub shop food to great dining in wonderful restaurants. I came across Carhops and what luck! I tried the pizza and told the waitress it was \"BOARDWALK WORTHY\". She said oh wow because the owner had been to Widwood, and I said it was similar to Macks pizza, she got all excited and said Omg wait a minute, then called the owner over. She said you're not gonna believe what she just said, and I told him his pizza is delicious and similar to Macks in Wildwood. He  said he spent 2 years perfecting his pizza to taste like MACKS in Wildwood! I said your cheese is really good, melts on the tongue and not a wad of rubberbands...he said it took him over 2 years to get the cheese blend right!!! I know great food people, and please!!!!!!! Go discover Carhops and you'll see, they'll blow Primantis grease pit outta the water!! If you don't like one thing, don't bash this place, try everything til you find your favorite. I promise, the burgers and pizza alone are worth the trip in! Burgers are on A BRIOCHE BUN!!!!! WHO DOES THAT!!! CARHOPS DOES! I mean it, and the pizza is the best in my opinion in all of Pittsburgh! I know great pizza and this man has got it! You'll see! Just try a plain slice!  You can get a special for 5 bucks, 2 slices and a soda!!! And the slices are big!! Check it out. I'm so lucky to have found it!"}
{"text":"I was the only person in the place.  That should have been a sign.  The took 45 minutes to make 2 slices of very terrible cold, under cooked pizza.  First they said that they burned my first 2 slices.  Then the guys behind the counter proceeded to eat those burnt slices.  Still no food.  I went for lunch, but had to take my slices with me in order to make it back to work on time.  This place is very very dirty.  I am used to eating in the strip, and most places arent the cleanest.  This was unacceptable.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Visited here twice and liked my meal both times.  The Diablo burger was nicely cooked and seasoned.  Another time I got a half a cheese steak, though I can't recall the name.  I wish I knew the pizza was so good or I would have tried it.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of Carhops until I saw a WPXI Just Pay Half deal where I could get 5 $10 gift certificates for $25.  It's no secret that I'm a sandwich lover so I was eager to give this place a try.  During my first visit I learned that they have Pennsylvania Dutch Birch Beer in their fountain which means I'm already in love before I've even tasted a sandwich. 

With a name like Carhops, it's no surprise that the sandwiches are named after cars.  I haven't tried them all (yet), but I've had the DeVille (cheesesteak), GTO (cheesesteak with bacon), Carhops Special Loaded (cold Italian) and the Super Sport (hot Italian).  The cheesesteak was good, but my favorite is definitely the Italian hoagies because of their hot peppers and relish.  Top a deliciously chewy baguette with some choice meats and cheese and those hot peppers and relish and you have yourself an unbeatable sandwich!  They are available in foot or two-foot long sizes.  I've seen the pizza slices and they look good but I have not yet tried them.

Their prices do seem a bit steep and their customer service can be hit or miss.  I think maybe they are still settling in to the new location which is fine.  I just don't know how often I will return once I use up my half off certificates."}
{"text":"Went to Carhops for first time ever today, never went to West Liberty location. As a downtown homeowner I love ANYPLACE that opens in downtown beause it's my neirbhorhood. 

Went in and had the reuben. The biggest baddest reuben I've ever seen. Good thick crisp bread, then corned beef piled so high it's amazing. Gooey melted swiss, tangy 1000 Island, thickest reuben I've ever seen. And did I mention how awesome the crispy thick cut rye was? Mmm! 

Hand cut fries, basic cheese sauce but the fries were plentiful, crispy, and seasoned real nice. 

Place is very clean, and it's open til' 6pm. Hoping when word gets out how awesome it is their hours will go later at nite. The menu looks amazing can't wait to get back and try a burger. Food also came out very fast, I ordered at 5 and was eating at 5:07."}
{"text":"After reading all the 5 star ratings on Carhops, we decided to give it a try. My hubby is from the East Coast; therefore, he is very particular about his subs. Carhops inside looks more like an old bar with few tables for dinners. We ordered Z28 and Carhops special. Z28 is nothing but cheesesteak sandwich with almost minced meat and few onion pieces. The steaks are thin and minced. The sandwich is tasteless.   The Carhops special consists of thinly sliced Italian meats, cheese, lettuce and hot pickled peppers. The seeds from the pickled peppers over taken sandwich, which leaves a taste of vinegar and pulps of peppers after each bite. After the meal, we miss Charley's Philly cheesesteak sandwich, which is a chain restaurant. Big disappointment!"}
{"text":"Had the 9 inch GTO is was good. A little more cheese and it would have been great.  I really liked the cheese fries.  And friend had slice of pizza and salad.  He said the pizza was great.  Waitress was excellent.!!!!"}
{"text":"Other than the food being a little greasy and the decor being unfinished this is a very good hole in the wall. My reuben rocked!!! The bacon cheese fries were an exercise in excess that made me exercise more after eating them! lol"}
{"text":"I stopped in here earlier today by myself for a to go lunch.  Whenever I stepped inside it was just after 1 PM on a Sunday and the place was empty.  The person who would wait and cook for me was also sitting at a booth and said he would be with me in a minute.  Neither of those are normally a good sign but I decided to try it anyways.  The inside of this place is actually bigger than it looks from the outside with a couple of booths on one side and a U shaped bar with a couple of high tops on the other.

My original intent in coming here was to get a smaller cheese steak and to try a slice of the pizza.  The reason for this is that they have signs outside saying \"pizza by the slice\" and \"#1 Cheese steak\".  That didn't exactly work out for me though as they have two sizes of cheese steaks, the coupe which is 1ft and the sedan which is 2ft.  The prices match those sizes too and so with that and not being able to find a slice of pizza on the menu I went with the first cheese steak on it in the coupe size.  The cashier asked me if I would like lettuce, tomato or onion.  I replied with lettuce and then after thinking about it for a minute I decided on the onion too.  Silly me for thinking that they would cook it with the steak as it ended up being raw.  After that exchange I found myself a seat in one of the empty booths and started to write the first paragraph of this review.  About half way through that paragraph, it couldn't have been more than 5 minutes, my food was ready and I was leaving the place.  The one thing I noticed right away was that the sandwich was wrapped nicely and it was long but boy was it pretty skinny.  I ended up spending about 30 minutes finishing my shopping in the strip before heading back to my car to eat the sandwich.  The bread looked like a baguette and had a decent crunch but as mentioned earlier was pretty skinny.  Since there wasn't much width to the bread, the sandwich was pretty filled up mostly by the steak with a little bit of melted cheese and also a little bit of lettuce and raw onion.  The sandwich ended up tasting just ok.  The meat was decent but the sandwich could have used some more cheese and I really wish that they would have cooked the onions.  In the end I had finished the sandwich but still found myself to be a little hungry.

The bottom line for me is that I probably would not stop by here again in the future.  My cashier was nice and the food was decent but I feel like I could get a lot better bang for my buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"The thing I dislike the most about the Pittsburgh bar/food scene is that after,probably 2 am at the absolute latest, the choices for that after-drinking meal/snack are very slim. Primantis has always been the \"go to\" place among people I frequently go out with-not because it is tasty (don't get me wrong, a Primanti's sandwich has it's time and place but I'm not an ultimate fan) but because it is centrally located and we know it's open 24/7. My friends and I had always seen Carhops in the strip but had not tried it until this past Saturday-what a mistake to not try carhops sooner! It's less greasy (although not extremely healthy) than Primanti's, more variety than Primanti's (not just sandwiches), and you can eat in or go up to the window. Plus they have pizza by the slice late into the night. I split a foot long Italian sandwich and it was the perfect size to split and not be overly stuffed. The bread seemed like a good quality for a late night sandwich as did all of the ingredients. My other friend had a couple slices of pizza and said it was really tasty. We were all in agreement, the next time late night hunger strikes after last call, Carhops will be the final stop of the night!"}
{"text":"Staying in downtown Pittsburgh fro a few months and wasn't happy with the local pizza offering being from Chicago.  We had a little Thursday night football party (Steelers vs Patriots) and one of the guys recommended \"Carhops\".  We had ordered 3 Xtra large pizzas a few salads and a 2 foot sub sandwich. Everyone loved everything,  the guy's kept asking where the hell did you get this pizza?  We had to drive severa blocks from the Omni William Penn hotel.  Great pizzas, great Subs at a great price.  This will be our go to pizza joint when staying in Downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that Carhops is moving to the Strip District. The current location is apparently vacant. I ride by it often."}
{"text":"Why Carhops moved I'm not sure. They seemed to have a pretty good life on West Liberty Avenue in the South Hills, relocating to a rough patch in The Strip District without expanding their somewhat odd hours.

A gearhead motif is central to the restaurant. License plates and street signs bedeck interiors that are in the process of slowly being remodeled as I write this (hence, no photos of the decor). The food, however, is top-flight sandwich shop-pizza parlor fare, and is in no way half-baked. 

Nonetheless, the sandwiches, all of them named after cars, did manage to rev up my stomach's engine. Cheesesteaks are Carhops specialty, and wanting to test them when Kay and I had dinner here last night, I had myself a \"Toyota Celica GT\" in size \"coupe,\" \"sedan\" being a second option that measures at a staggering 2 feet long! 

The plush, po'boy worthy bread was so fresh I suspect that they bake it in-house, and it was packed with unctuous shredded sirloin that was not at all gummy. Grilled onions, hot sausage, the requisite l-t-o, and a spicy \"special sauce\" rounded out the highly edible construct, taking my palate on a fiery (the steak in my sandwich was plentiful) joyride in an egregiously beefy stolen vehicle.  

Also impressive was the smoldering heap of Bacon Cheese Fries that included a generous garnish of real, cooked-to-order bacon atop a bed of molten liquid cheddar, shredded mozzarella, and tater twigs so sublimely twice deep-fried,  therefore making them chip-crispy and mash-fluffy, I have to wonder if any of the cooks are Original Hot Dog Shop alumni -- these are such seriously well-prepared french fries I'm surprised they aren't mentioned on lists of the best around.

Furthermore, it boggles my mind that the pizza isn't discussed either. I ordered one cut and was amazed at the slender, magnificently seasoned crust's balance betwixt chewiness and crunch. The texture of a Nestle 100 Grand candy bar was recalled. Blessed with the holiest of olive oils, anointed with herbs, laden with a fabulous, fatty mozzarella, grounded by a robust sauce, and studded with teacup-shaped pepperoni, each bite of this pie slice cruised like a dream. If it were served on a New York street corner, it would be legend by now. Never before have I eaten such a rich and deeply flavorful pizza served in such titanic proportions. If you have nothing else at Carhops (or you're short on money, heh), pony up $3 (toppings are 50 cents each) and treat yourself to a royal cut of this superfine, bona fide pizza.

My only gripe with Carhops is their apparent price-gouging ($33 for two foot-long sandwiches, 2 fountain beverages, an order of bacon cheese fries, and one cut of pizza???), so a 4 out of 5 is what it gets. 

Carhops is Thin Man's rough-trade older cousin. He may not be high-class, but he's bad-ass, and that's all he needs.

Vroom, vroom...

{"text":"The boss was heading to a diner today for a lunch meeting, and being already tired of my leftovers for the week, my mind starting thinking of diner Reubens, and I had a craving that had to be filled.

I googled 'Reubens' and 'Strip District' and a few dining establishments that have vanished from the Strip District, but not from Google, popped up.  The one that was current was the brand new Car Hops, citing 'Reuben' on the menu.   So, since the Strip offerings really are limited when you work there, I decided to go for broke and fulfill the craving while trying out the new place on the block.

I had heard a few 'meh' reports from co-workers who tried it once, but was really set on a Reuben.  So I went in, and found it on the menu (at $12.50) and pretty much indeed DID go for 'broke' for a lunch sandwich.  

The burly tattooed man behind the counter 'warned' me that it was huge, and I replied with a 'this is a test, we'll see.'

When I travel to NYC, say for a long weekend, four out of my six meals will probably be Reubens, because it's the one place (seemingly) on the planet, where you can get a SUPERB Reuben anywhere they serve a Reuben.  I think it's NY law.  And I DO love a good Reuben.

I placed the order and paid, and then waited about fifteen minutes, and the gal behind the counter brought it out to me in a styro container in a bag, and I walked it back to the office.  It had a good weight to it, and I was encouraged.

I sat it down on my desk, pulled the styro container out of the bag, and popped it open.  It WAS huge...it filled the entire container, and it did look pretty darned good.

But then I sat down with my soda and a few paper towels and started eating it.

BREAD!!!

Rye bread, that was very possibly more than a full inch thick - a kind of Texas Toast thickness...TONS of sauerkraut and thousand island sauce that made it squishy...but a little light on the meat and cheese.  

My co-workers had also commented on the bread being a bit too much and the contents being light in what they'd had...why I didn't listen...I don't know.

Honestly kids...do NOT try to dupe me with a loaf of bread with no stuffing...I'm hip to the jive.  What was inside that loaf of bread was not worth the $12.50 price tag.

This was another FTLT visit.  

Although, I must admit - while I waited for the sandwich to be made - someone at a table had ordered cheese fries, and they did look awfully good.  They were real potato fries, but they were smothered in that gooey orangey fakey cheese sauce, which to ME is what sinfully delicious cheese fries are supposed to be all about.

I 'might' go back and try the cheese fries - at $3.75 for a healthy sized basket, that might be a worthy splurge lunch.  

But I won't be going back for a Reuben - or any other loaf-o-bread sandwich.  

You don't eat a Reuben for the rye bread.  It's all about the meat and cheese - with the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing being VERY secondary, only there for flavor.

And that goes for any other sandwich - it's all about the filling - not the wrapper."}
{"text":"Not the best steak sammy I've ever had but certainly not the worst. Asked for red sauce on the side and it came ice cold. I mean cold enough to ice down a sprained ankle.  Uh you could have given me a heads up on that.  

Place was very clean and owners extremely nice.  Meat was good quality but did not have enough flavor.  Needed lots of mayo and salt to taste good.....

Sandwich comes on (I believe) a baguette, which is way cooler than a normal sub roll and fairly tasty too.

Bring your appetite -- the small is a foot long and the large is two feet long!!!

Note:  Fries looked quite tasty but sadly I was not hungry enough to order them :(

This place is located on a side street off of the main drag in the Strip District.  Hey, it's a nice place to duck out of the crowds and it's far better  (imho) than eating standing up from a street vendor."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say other than, I love Carhops. I've been eating there for years and I've never been disappointed. Good food good service, family run. The theme inside the sub shop is all about cars and there's a bar in back. 

I have an unhealthy obsession with one of their sandwiches called the z-28. ( see picture) Its a fabulous cheese steak sub and it comes with all the things that dreams are made of,  including marinated steak, sauteed onions, white American cheese and the more minced garlic than you can imagine. The bread is baked fresh daily from a local bakery and is to die for. Some times I get peppers and mushrooms too. 

I love this sandwich so much that last labor day i had my boyfriend pick up a sedan (2 ft) z-28 sub and bring it with him from Pittsburgh to Detroit. so we could enjoy it together on our picnic. Sick right? Well I'll have you know that I have seriously considered giving them a call and seeing if they would be willing to ship one to me in LA. No matter the cost. 
I've tried a few other things there too. I think it was the fire bird. Which ever one had chicken and marinara. That was decent. Their loaded cheese fries are awesome. Lots of bacon bits. They call them something else though. Something car related. 
My boyfriends favorite sub was the carhops special (hot) which is a favorite of many. I didn't really stray to much from my usual sandwich but they have lots of other subs and pizza too. 

Now let me just say that in the past five years I have tried to find a decent cheese steak sub that is at least comparable to the z-28 but its just no use. That sandwich is unique to carhops and always will be. The only place that has even come close is Jersey Mikes sub shop in Burbank. (which I'll be reviewing later) Its pretty good but I have nearly unreachable expectations for what I think a cheese steak sub should be so, I will continue to carry a torch for Carhops subs for as long as I have to. 
I love you carhops, I'd marry you if it were legal and sane to do so. 
- Love Laura"}
