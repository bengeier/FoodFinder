{"text":"The pizza was not as good as I had hoped. The dough was slightly undercooked. I liked the sauce though. My wife had a mushroom pizza and they used canned mushrooms on it. There is no excuse to use canned mushrooms on pizza ever. In my search for great pizza in lorain county I was let down today."}
{"text":"First time here and we thoroughly enjoyed it from the service to the food!!  The margarita sauce is made to order and is DEVINE!  I had this on my generous spaghetti dinner served with cold salad (pick your 3 toppings) and a giant breadstick!  I can't wait to eat my leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  My husband had the Schobel fold over (spicy pepperoni, lean ham, bacon, ricotta, mozzarella and sauce)...he loved it!  He also has leftovers to take home (6 slice pie) after his side salad too!

We will definitely be back!!

I might add also that the website said they were open til 10 (Monday) and they actually closed at 9. We arrived a bit after 8. We finished slightly after 9 and noticed them doing their side work and clean up. My husband asked when they close and that's when we found out the time was wrong. YET, they never rushed us nor made us feel as if we were in their way. Whereas, many other restaurants get downright rude and ignore you. So for that alone, we'd add another star! Thank you ladies who worked tonight (8/10/15)!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is not too bad but the service is fk'in ridiculous. I have called more than once around 9:30 and they're \"closed for the night\". The employees are a bunch of high school kids who don't give any crap and act like you're a big inconvenience because you want to order something, and that they'd actually have to do their job. Pitiful. Anyone reading this, just go get D'tutentellis' down the street."}
{"text":"I love this place, have only been a handful of times but it really is good pizza! Their salads are to die for....cheese bacon eggs ham pepperoni lettuce italian dressing (\" YUMM"}
{"text":"The best pizza around.  Salad bar is always fresh.  Soups of the day is a meal of itself.  Everything on the menu is top quality and prepared to perfection.  The ownership is best in class and it shows throughout the working staff.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've come back many times since my last review and have never again had an issue. They are polite and always on spot with the order, and if not, immediately fix it. And seriously, best piece of pie in the county. Try the blackjack chicken fold over pizza, or the bacon mushroom cheeseburger pizza. Don't forget their massive cheese sticks. Amaze balls."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times the food was absolutely delicious, the service was subpar. The wait staff were not very friendly or attentive, even though it was not crowded. The last experience I had here, our pizzas came out exceptionally late, which we would have overlooked had we not felt so rushed to leave! This place closes at 10 pm and our pizzas came out around 8:45. The staff was clearly trying to close by 9 and did not apologize for the lateness of our food but made us feel like we were being rude by staying (we left by 9:10). I hope the employees take this into account because the food, drinks, and atmosphere are great - just cheer up and be more accommodating!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cleveland, and I come here all the time. Their pizza is really good ! That's all I get. Once in a while I'll get a sub, which are good as well. They even have funnel cakes for dessert.  that I love. Good service."}
{"text":"The BEST! Food is always fresh and delicious. It's always a tough choice to decide what I want off of the menu."}
{"text":"This pizza was well made and people at our table loved it. It's just not my taste in pizza. The sauce was too sweet and didn't have enough flavor for my taste. The cheese also had the same problem. The crust was very underwhelming. Again, none of this is the fault of the kitchen, I just do not like the recipe. I've heard the salads here are great, so I'll give that a try next time. The staff was friendly here as well."}
{"text":"Took my parents to old town first time because 2 months before had a good pizza! Ordered same things and this time and was served burnt pizza! Crust was black and hard. When I complained to the waitress she said I could make a new one but can't guarantee it won't be burnt . Asked to see manager who said he was owners son and he told me he liked his pizza burnt more. He would not admit it was burnt. Rude service and no guarantee you'll be satisfied. I'll buy my pizza from pizza shops that want to satisfy the customer from now on."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. However, I can't so 1 will have to do. I am very picky where I eat pizza and this place was phenomenal in both the quality of food and service. After our first meal there, the owner came out and engaged in a  conversation, very personable in manner. Me, my mom and my dad came back quite a few times in the last two weeks. Last night, my uncle wanted to go out to eat and my mom happily said \"let's go to Olde Town Pizza!\". We all agreed on the decision. When we arrived it was bustling with people. There must've been some sort of high school function because there were what seemed to be athletes, coaches and parents at various tables. Evidently, the place was packed. Our waitress was extremely sweet and was trying her best to keep up with the rush. When it came time to order, my mom, who is a vegetarian, ordered a salad, I also ordered a salad, my dad ordered pizza and my uncle, who is also a vegetarian, ordered pasta with pizza sauce since the spaghetti sauce is meat based. When he got his pasta, the spaghetti sauce was on it. He requested it to be taken back and the pizza sauce be put on it. Then my salad came out which looked good and the pizza also came out. Then my mom's salad came out and there was chicken on it. She was confused and thought the chicken was an add on. She had misread the menu and admitted her mistake. The waitress was understanding and said that she would have a new salad made. My mom was very grateful. When her salad came back out, much to her dismay, there was a piece of chicken on it. It was then very clear that the salad had been taken back and the chicken had just been removed. Being a vegetarian, that is unacceptable because of the values they hold. Since the waitress was up to her neck in work, my mom decided to go and find her to make her job easier. As she was walking back to the kitchen, the owner whom I had mentioned before, was sitting at a table with other folks eating. Before she could even reach the doorway to the kitchen, he jumped up and cut her off. She then began to explain what had happened with her salad. She was not rude and she did not raise her voice. He cut her off and got in her face telling her to \"admit\" that she had gotten what she asked for. She agreed to that but said that she just wanted it to be remade and that she would still pay for it. She tried to explain from her point of view that having the chicken just taken off the salad goes against her values. He just continued to raise his voice at her and told her to admit it. She then became very discouraged and handed him the salad asking it to be taken off our bill. She came back to our table looking distraught and we asked what had happened and she told us what he had said to her. The owner then followed my mom to the table and began to yell at her in front of me and my family. He was saying that it had been a long day and they had been working their butts off since 7 am. It seemed like he was blaming my mom for the whole situation. In my eyes, was talking down to her. He was saying all sorts of things to my mom, one of which was I don't want you coming back to my establishment. He also used profanity in his speech that I found very offensive. I, being almost 18, know that this behavior is unacceptable. He was acting like a 4 year old throwing a fit when he was told something he didn't want to hear. I have never seen my mom so upset and I am very angry that this happened to her. She was very kind and apologetic in the things she said and she did not deserve this treatment at all. I will never return to this establishment as long as I live in Ohio."}
{"text":"Olde Town Pizza House has a lot of competitors that do a lot better and don't come with an attitude!!  The pizza has good flavor, but the toppings have become less and less. The \"thin\" crust is not the typical thin crust either. I've never known a thin crust pizza to have a thick outer crust. For the price, competitors offer an overall better pizza. The pizza always seems to come with an attitude too!  

The past two times we've placed a to go order, we've received an attitude when asking for the order to be repeated back to ensure the toppings are correct. The young mans response was a big sigh and then he said you ordered a large and a mini with plus some items and minus some items. WOW! I had to take a deep breath and just chuckle to keep from saying what was really on my mind because it wasn't a nice thought. Most places repeat your order back as an act of professionalism and also quality control to avoid an unhappy customer who receives an incorrect order. When the order wasn't repeated and I made what I thought was a simple request, you would have thought I was asking the guy for something that he was unable to do. 

Just as anticipated, one of the pizzas came without pineapple as requested!  We lived without it, but it certainly would have been nice to receive what we ask for and also paid for. The young man needs an attitude adjustment! YELP has a lot of followers and this is a sure way to have a voice and attitude that will certainly speak louder than your rude employees!  

Needless to say, when we arrived to pick up our order the older gentleman couldn't have been nicer and knew for certain how to treat your customers.  I would suggest having him answer your phones.

{"text":"My favorite pizza short of Samoskys and Mama Santas. It can get busy on the weekends but the staff works hard and they all have a great attitude."}
{"text":"In all seriousness, this is probably one of the best pizzas that you can get in Lorain County.  Yes, it's that good.  While it might take a bit of time to actually get your pie (it took us 30 minutes for a carry-out order), it's still a good quality.  The crust is good, not too thick and not too thin, the source is flavorful (but not 'tangy), and the toppings are well placed and bountiful.  

If you're not in the mood for pizza, their other menu options are pretty good as well -- my wife gets a \"Woogie Bear\" which is amazing.  The prices aren't bad -- a family pie will feed three people (probably could have fed four) and is under $20 with a few toppings."}
{"text":"Last minute stop in for take away on a Sunday evening.   Awesome Hawaiian Pizza - thick crust and loaded with ham, sweet pineapple and different cheeses!   Can't wait to have the leftovers for breakfast!   Would definitely go back on next visit!"}
{"text":"Always my go-to when I'm back home in Amherst. From stombolis and Woogies to pizza and pasta it's all good here.  Family owned and operated, they always come out and greet the customers and add that extra bit of comfort to a great food experience.  I had the fettuccine pasta with blush sauce and meatballs tonight.  This came with a salad and a breadstick all for under $10 which is definitely a great deal compared to most Italian restaurants. They've recently added a small patio which was the icing on the cake with my meal tonight.  Couldn't recommend it enough to people stopping through town."}
{"text":"Not as good as it was before they did building improvements. Seems like they cut corners on the meals."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but not even close to good enough for the rude service!  I used to love the pizza but the rudeness of the  owners makes it worth going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just went there two days ago and we loved everything! It was our first visit and won't be the last one. It was the best pizza that I ever had and filled all of us up. The waitress was also very kind and kept providing us with refills. Definitely recommend this place to anybody that loves pizza."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid, a bit of a family stop for years. Food is always good, but I do agree with some people that the service could use some work. The servers as of late seem to not have the attentiveness that they used to. I also noticed some have been dressed more plain clothes than wearing the old town shirt and such, which at first made us confused if it was a server or a random person coming up to talk to us. Other than that, a lot of work was put in adding the new(ish) front end to the building and the interior looks great for it. 

As for some people complaining that they get turned away at like 8:50.....The dining room closes at 9. It is because they keep the place open an hour later for pick up. Says so right on the site, and they tell you that if you ask."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times since moving near the area and will be back again and again. The pizza is the best I've tasted in a long time. The sauce is soooooo good! Not sweet, like some pizza joints that are chains. Pizza is cooked to perfection. Not raw inside if you get a lot of toppings. I tried the thin crust pizza also and even my thick crust husband loved it. I like the way you can order salads with 2, 3 or 4 toppings to pick from a large assortment. salad bar was small, so I opted for a regular salad. I liked the dressing as well. Pasta was very good. Seating comfortable and wait staff very pleasant."}
{"text":"The service was not acceptable. I hope they fix what they can. The pizza wad pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! 2 years we have been looking for a good pizza place and finally found it. 9 out of 10 pizzas we have tried in the area are very doughy and seem not fully cooked. Also they are covered in sauce and a sweet sauce at that. This place smelt amazing from the moment we walked in. We were promptly greeted and sat down. We ordered the deluxe za and a Chicago style. Both were wonderful! Not drenched in sauce and perfectly cooked. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Very very glad we tried Old Town pizza out! We will be back many times."}
{"text":"On August 11th I attempted to pick up a pizza through the take out area. Unfortunately I had to wait because I wasn't able to enter due to a verbal fight going on between a 50ish woman customer and the Old Town staff of juveniles. There were physical threats made toward this woman by the staff. I went home and called back up there and asked to speak to a manager, unfortunately the manager was one of the employees involved in this altercation. So I proceeded to call this morning and speak to the owner. He insisted this was between to customers. I assured him it was NOT! And advised him that NO ONE said \"let this lady through\". He obviously did not want to believe me that I witnessed his employees threatening this woman and then proceed to go back in behind the take out counter. I as a CUSTOMER have never been behind the counter. He just wanted to argue with me about the horrible customer experience I had encountered WAS NOT HIS EMPLOYEES! He never once apologized for what I had experienced. UNREAL! WILL NOT BE BACK, EVER! WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"I haven't been the biggest fan over the years.  Most people (including my husband) in the area rave about Olde Town and I never understood why.  Then, last Friday, my family of 4 decided to go to the Christmas parade and wanted to eat somewhere downtown first.  Ziggy's was too busy so I agreed to give Olde Town a shot even though I'd never really liked it.  

I hadn't been there since it was remodeled and was happily surprised with how much nicer it is.  There was about a 5 minute wait which wasn't a big deal.  The service was great; they were very attentive.  We got a family size thick crust pepperoni pizza.  I don't know if they've changed the recipe or my taste buds have changed but it was delicious.   We also ordered a side of French fries so my boys (2 and 5) could snack on something.  The pizza was awesome but the fries were strange.  They were thick like steak fries but kinda rounded, like curly fries.  They were short, fat, curled potatoes.  I've never seen anything like it.  They tasted fine but since they didn't look like what my kids know, they wouldn't eat them.  I guess that's my only complaint!

The owner and his wife also came over and were very friendly.  I will definitively go back."}
{"text":"Haven't had Olde Town Pizza in 5 months... Only because it's a 20 minute drive. I was very disappointed... I asked for toppings to the edge.. Didn't happen! I don't mind paying $18 for a pizza, but gee whiz, why can't I get toppings to the edge?? Omg.... I don't believe they didn't even add sauce!!! DRY, DRY, DRY!!!! 5 months ago, Andrew made our pizza... It was perfect!!! I'll only go back if Andrew is there to make our pizza!  #UnsatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"i think olde town is maybe 3.5 stars. they do make a mean calzone. it is just ok for a small town kind of place. the place is packed on friday and saturday nights, but i think there are only a few maybe one other sit down pizza place in the area, so by default this is where the 'regulars' crowd to for their 'big night out!' # justsayin
i do have to give them high regards to the famous woogie bear. i grew up on these as a child and although i have not had in a LONG time, i remember them being a crispy, cheesy yummy treat. 
we typically order the family style calzone, sauce on the side. it is HUGE. always comes out of the oven super dee duper HOTTT! 
if you are in the area, give them a try, but dont drive long distances to try the pie! 
xo"}
{"text":"I've been to Olde Town Pizza twice now and have not had a bad experience. The food has been good (though not the best pizza i've ever had, but still pretty good). The service has been alright. It wasn't anything special, but far from the worse that i've had at restaurants. I intend to go back again some day if i'm hungry and in that area again."}
{"text":"We moved here 2 years ago, and finally got around to eating here after having friends and neighbors rave about it.   For the life of me, I can't understand what all the fuss is about.   My husband got the salad bar, which seemed nice and fresh and he enjoyed it.  We decided to get a large, thin crust pizza with sausage, onions, and green peppers.  It was hot when it arrived, but the crust didn't seem cooked enough.   There was very little sauce, but loads of cheese.  Lots of toppings, but the rest of the pizza wasn't any good so the toppings couldn't save it.  Super disappointed in the pizza.   Only good thing was service, which was excellent."}
{"text":"It's pretty good pizza,  It was a 5 star back in the day when it was Danny Boys but still pretty good.  I am a fan of the calzones.  Some days are better then others"}
{"text":"A small but great place in the heart of Amherst.  I ordered the salad and soup bar.   With a order of garlic bread with cheese.  The ingredients in the salad bar were fresh and tasty.  The soup of the day was: Buffalo Chicken soup.  I absolutely enjoyed every bite of my meal.  The cheese bread was just perfect cheese goodness.  I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Old Town has great spaghetti and even better Pizza. Their salad bar is basic and small but it serves its purpose. A recently added addition gives more room and new life to the dining area. If you are in the mood for pizza and Italian or sandwiches then it's definitely a good stop"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a pizza with the boys on a cold Friday night on the way to bowling. It did not disappoint. The crust was delicious and crispy yet soft like a pillow and the toppings were very generous. The amount of cheese was plentiful. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Was losing my faith in Ohio pizza.  Olde Town redeemed it.  Had a Chicago style and a traditional.  Chicago style used regular crust, but was inverted like Chicago and was pretty tasty.  Our server Sam  was pleasant and helpful.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Being relatively new to the area, my wife and I have been seeking input from locals regarding restaurant recommendations for various ropes of food. We both love pizza, so we are eager to find a go-to pizza place. A few people had recommended Olde Town for their pizza and we finally had an opportunity to give it a try. 

The parking is limited, but there is a lot across the street. The restaurant is pretty small and loud. Table are sandwiched in and the booths are extremely cramped. 

Service was excellent (friendly and attentive)! In addition, the manger is constantly roaming around making sure everything is good. We went with friends who recommended the salad bar, which can be ordered with a meal for about $4-5. My wife and I ordered a large thin crust pizza with sausage, green peppers and onions to share. 

The salad bar is small, but ample. Everything was fresh. The pizza was another story. Admittedly, we are pretty fussy about our pizza. However, I would venture to say at anyone that enjoys thin crust, NY style pizza would be disappointed. The crust is far from thin, there was little to no sauce and the entire pizza was covered with a very thick, gooey mozzarella cheese that dominated the the flavor of the pizza. To be honest, we have had frozen pizza purchased at the grocery store that was better. 

We were very disappointed as we were hopeful. The sandwiches we noticed delivered to other patrons looked good. If we were to return, which is doubtful, we would try that.

If I were to rate the restaurant solely on our experience with the pizza, the rating would be a notch or to two lower."}
{"text":"Dined in, the pizza is great but the salad had a bug in it. Told the waitress and she acted like she didn't care. Even left the salad plates at the table when she went back to talk to the manager and only came back to bring the pizza so we paid our bill and left."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple weeks ago and was great!!! We had the salad bar which was very fresh and deep dish pizza. Their deep dish is so thick hubby wanted to try it I think personally I'd like to stick to the regular it filled me up too much Lol. The sauce on their pizza is so tasty I think my fav pizza in the area. Service was great and we left stuffed with leftover pizza for lunch the next day, it was good cold!!!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. It's a toss up between Olde Town and Ziggys for best pizza in Amherst or area for that matter. Again, hear about price sometimes. You want cheap, go to Little Cesear's and enjoy your $5 Hot n Ready."}
{"text":"Got there about 5:30 on a Saturday - still a lot of empty tables.  My family of three waited 35 minutes and still didn't have food (after placing our order).  We weren't even acknowledged by our server.  No thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love Old Town! IT is SO GOOD. I will admit I haven't had the pizza. But the salads are amazing. Also I had a gyro and it was delicious as well. The atmosphere is great. Food tastes fresh and good and classy. The best place in Amherst for absolute sure. Plus the service is great. Sometimes it takes a little time to get orders.. but servers are friendly and overall I love this place!"}
