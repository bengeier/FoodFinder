{"text":"Pizza is the best. Good Food, Good Price, Good Service & CLEAN. Would recommend for any occasion. Friendly comfortable establishment. If there is an issue with any of the above, its nice to know that the owner or one of the \"boys\" are always on site for compliments or to take care of an issue."}
{"text":"I work at a restaurant nearby to Arturos and I always enjoy a drink with friends or co workers there. We even have our Christmas party there every year. Great place to hang out and drink with friends. It can be a chill night or an epic one. Wait staff is great too. Dino is almost always behind the bar to serve me my so-co &lemonade and some humor. Have eaten there numerous times; everything is delicious from prime rib to deluxe pizzas.   On a side note those bad reviews are ridiculous. You have to ask for a menu? What your mouth is broken? Sit at a damn table then and your implications to eat will be met! Most people who sit at the bar are there to drink. Also, Employees who work in the industry are 95% likely to have a cold refreshing beverage or cocktail after their shift. Obviously they like where they work or they wouldn't support it afterwords. It's a bar, stop being so uptight"}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been hounding me for a while to try this place out. We decide to go on Sunday while the browns game is on. She got a small pizza and I got the Italian sausage sandwich.Mine was ice cold. I brought it up to my server and he takes it back to the kitchen. 20 minutes later, here comes the same sandwich, bite mark and all, soggy and microwaved. I can guarantee I will never eat here again. Obvious lack of care for their food. Oh and our server was nothing to mention either. The keno machine had better personality."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. Getting seated and served the correct food and drinks was too challenging for the staff. As if that wasn't enough, all of the checks came out wrong. We were all charged extra for items we did not order. I calmly approached my server about getting charged for an extra beer, but was called a liar by her, the bartender, and the manager. Eventually we got the checks corrected, but the experience was frustrating to say the least."}
{"text":"Always a great spot to grab a drink and a pizza when visiting Cleveland. Place is clean, food is great, and staff is friendly. We visit this place almost every time we visit from Florida and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Bartender was so rude! Waitress mentioned that bartender is forced to tell people not to come to the bar if they have a server because the owner doesnt like it. OK, but does that require her to be flat our rude to us? Where do \"owner rules\" end and customer service begin? Waitress was nice but entirely overwhelmed. Food was underwhelming, pizza was flavorless. Plenty of better pizza places in the area, I suggest any of them over this one."}
{"text":"I've been to this bar about a half dozen to a dozen times. Of the bar/restaurants in North Olmsted, this is by far the worst service. I've always sat at the bar and have found the bar tenders to be cold and unwelcoming.   I've lived in the area for about 8 months and have frequented all of the other local joints. I've always wanted to try the food at Arturo's, but have only had drinks and tried the Shrimp Basket.   Every time that I've sat at the bar, I've almost had to beg for a menu. On a recent Friday night, I asked the bar tender what type of fish was in the Friday Fish Fry. A one word answer, \"haddock\" or \"cod\" or whatever white fish was all they said. Not, \"would you like to order some?\" Then they walked away.  Another night I asked if the kitchen was still open. After a glance at the clock, all they said was, \"yep.\" Never offered a menu or asked if I wanted to order.   The one night I did flag someone down and ordered the shrimp basket, I was left wishing I had been ignored. The shrimp was the awful, non-deveined type. Full of shrimp poop.  Another one of the big turnoffs is that at least one of the female bartenders tends to spend a lot of time on the other side of the bar drinking with friends. No doubt, she has just finished work and is off the clock during these times, but it's tacky to see someone keep walking behind the bar to pour their own drinks--especially when I'm sitting there with an empty drink.  I recommend KC's around the corner or even Applebee's (a place I usually abhor) before Arturo's. That's sad because I always try to patronize the local, independent joints. After several opportunities, Arturo's is off my list."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout here and it's always been good. I've never eaten in. The pizza is A+ and I've tried many of the apps.  Since my mom lives kind of close this has become one of our go to places."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar.  We love their pizza.  Happy hour specials are good, particularly the drinks.  There are a lot of regulars that are fun to people watch.  Plenty of tvs and good food specials."}
{"text":"Such a demoralizing place to go. My wife takes golf lessons a couple doors down and we have met here afterwards for casual dinner. Been there 3 times in last few months and experience is always same - we situation bar and notice a group of regulars close to door. Bartenders always give their attention and time to regulars. We always feel like we're interrupting them...and never get asked for more drinks or additional food items at the same pace the regulars do. In many places, sitting at bar for dinner is the best experience, but not here....except for a handful of regulars.  We're done with my his place...won't be in the way anymore."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings . Quick service and always clean! I would Definitely recommend giving it a try . Family owned and Open late."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Menu is good, i.e. bar food, wings, pizza, burgers, poppers.  Food is good but servings are on the small side.  Prices aren't bad. Not a huge beer selection but adequate. It's unfortunate though that every time I've been here I've been really annoyed with service. They are rude and slow.  I've actually walked out after waiting 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our presence while standing around chatting. Most of the time they are just flat out rude."}
{"text":"As was mentioned, this place was burnt down in a fire last year and has since been rebuilt, and it's nice, but kind of lacking personality. I'm sure in a couple years it will be better, it just seems like a brand new house that hasn't been lived in yet. There was a one man band playing that was fun, and the drink selection was good, but the best part has to be the pizza we had. It was really a great pizza. I'm sure we'll go back again. I always feel bad for small businesses that get a one star based on one bad night. I definitely don't think they deserve it."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had a New York Strip, onion rings, salad, and bread for $10.99, and I've paid much more for food that didn't taste as good. My husband is something of a pizza connoisseur, and he was very happy with his pie. Our waitress was attentive and sweet, too (wish I'd gotten her name), even though it was a crowded Saturday night.   Forget the chain restaurants a block away at Great Northern. Come here instead. I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful wait staff good food. I erroneously informed others in our party that I had looked to yelp prior to visiting. The \"thin\" pizza that another reviewer was not happy with was more than fine. As for \"small\" portions, six out of eight of us took food home. Staff did everything but drive us home and tuck us in. Every Friday has fish to boot. I only give five stars to jiggly bars FYI.  Please follow the driving/parking arrows as lost drivers are hazardous."}
{"text":"All the good is homemade. Really seem to care about bringing you back. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Environment is dull.   Service is average to below average.  Pizza is greasy and really not good at all and I have low standards for pizza.  Had their food twice in my life and will never care to go there again."}
{"text":"Had pizza here many times, but came for dinner and had the haddock and wild rice.  Very good and well prepared.  Nice environment and waitress was friendly and prompt.  Great happy hour until 7pm. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to Arturo's on Wednesday night for a quick bite.  We ordered one entree that came with soup and an order of potato skins.  The server had no personality and it seemed as if she could not care less if we were in the restaurant.  The restaurant was slow with only 3 people at the bar and about 6 or 7 tables in the dining area.  It took 20 minutes to get a cup of soup.  Soup!  From a pot in the kitchen.  Soup.  20 minutes.  The food came about 10 minutes after that and it was about as bland as the server.  She never came to check on us to see if the food was ok and returned 18 minutes later to see if we needed a to go container.  I have never felt so unwanted in an establishment in my life.  Sour faces on the staff and complete lack of a sense of urgency.  Sorry Arturo's but I wont be back.  I read through several other postings and some people mentioned that they enjoyed the pizza here.  If the pizza is so good then were are the people?  I will stay with Angelo's in Lakewood.  It truly is the best and that's why there is a line out the door, 7 days a week.  They also appreciate my business.  Don't waste your time at this place.  Bad food and terrible service.  Why on earth would anyone want to go here?"}
{"text":"I have been here about three times now and it great place to get some good food, good drinks, and watch a game. The bartenders are always friendly and attentive and service is fast in terms of getting drinks and food. Pizza is always great option but any of the appetizers are also an excellent option. You also won't beat the price. Happy hour and in game specials match pretty much anywhere in town worth going without skipping out on quality of food and amount you get in a drink. Especially during Indians games, Miller lite is dirt cheap. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in an earlier review, the atmosphere is pretty bland and would definitely not bring me back in again. However, the chowder and beef stew are well above average bar fare and worth the trip on a cool day. Give it a try and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"SO happy my mom and I decided to try Arturo's on a late Saturday night. We originally tried Fat Little Buddies, could barely walk in, couldn't even get in the parking lot at Razzles and Aces, then finally tried for the first time Arturo's!   NCAA was on so we didn't want a crowded bar and this was the perfect place, some people but not crowded by any means. Also, I hate live bands, and this place did not have a live band thank god! They were playing the TV channel which was 80's music, however, I enjoyed it actually. Made the experience different I think, it a good way.   Our bartender, who I think his name is Dino? or something close to that, was really friendly and cool. I enjoyed a tall summer shandy which I was so happy they had on draft! Then after that we decided to order some food to take home.   Pizza was really good! A nice change from my personal favorite, Danny Boys. Not as heavy, but authentic. Good price too, for a 6 slice pizza it was about $7/8? Not bad at all! I really liked the breaded mushrooms too! There was a ton of them for about $3.   Only constructive criticism that I have is something I'm sure you'll find at any bar, is one guy who I am pretty sure usually works there was drunk and loud talking to the other people that were sitting around the bar. I was trying not to make eye contact so he wouldn't come by me, which he didn't thank god! Haha although it would have been entertaining, I wasn't feeling a loud, drunk guy that night. But hey it happens to the best of us. Besides that other people there were really friendly, definitely gave me the home-town bar type feel :) Great location too, kind of across from the mall behind Wendys.  I am a huge couponer and I receive coupons for Arturos all the time so I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Menu is good.  If you are coming here for \"atmosphere,\" you might be disappointed.  But truly, I would rather have good food rather than good atmosphere.  The wait staff is very nice and helpful and even if we have a large party, they don't have a problem separating the bills and ALWAYS ask before hand if it is to be separate bills.  The party room is good for a small to medium group.  I have never had their pizza because every time I am there, something else calls my name.  The wings are good, as are the potato skins.  And no matter what people say about the portion sizes, we usually have leftovers."}
{"text":"Came here for a birfday party the other day and had fun!  Driven past this place 100 times and never even noticed it.  Didnt spend much time in the bar area.  It seemed simple, but nice.  The party room was sparce and had the typical Italy pics and stuff on the wall but served its purpose.  They had girls getting beer and serving the party room.  All were nice and were quick with the refiils.  Seems more like a bar-type place so dont know if I would bring the lil one though.  Had a piece of pizza and it was good.  Dont really dig italian food but this tasted like most all the others ive had.  Little bit older crowd and pinky rings a' blazin...  Q: Did you hear about the winner of the Italian beauty contest? A: Me neither.   Q: Why don't Italians have freckles? A: Because they slide right off."}
{"text":"Friendly people, good service, but the price is not at all worth what you get. I'm left with a writhing stomach ache from the food the morning after as well. There are better options in this area to consider."}
{"text":"Average bar food served by average wait staff.  The pizza was good, but nothing great. We sat at a booth next to the bar, and apparently you can't get the appetizer specials at the tables.  We're spending money. Why have ridiculous rules like that?  Really irked me."}
{"text":"So we had a family party planned tonight at 7 pm in the party room with 16 people. Unfortunately we showed up to find an empty parking lot and closed restaurant. I understand adverse weather and power outages, but I also respect other peoples time and inconvenience. It would have been nice to receive a phone call alerting the party of 16 that the power was out and we would need to find a new location or reschedule."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza's and a salad for the first time last weekend. The pizza was terrible, they were so small and way over priced. Ordered extra cheese which there was none. The salad was a grilled chicken salad and the chicken tasted like fish. I do not recommend this place at all. A total waste of money. Also, the delivery time was well over an hour so the pizza's were cold. I called to complain and they totally brushed me off, no refund or corrected pizza's offered. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"It took us awhile to find this place when we lived in n olmsted but we were glad we did. Good pizza! Would order again if we were still in the area."}
{"text":"Had an amazing deluxe pizza!  It was amazing and their sausage is the best I've had!  FatHeadsHeadHunter on Tap, who could ask for more!  Salads are fabulous too!"}
{"text":"We just LOVE Arturo's!  There is a reason this longstanding 'mom and pop' establishment has been here since the pyramids of Egypt were built!  Mainly, good food (selection too), good service, and good pricing that beats the national chains!  We enjoy bringing the kids here for pizza, and the servers are very professional, kind, and accomodating.  Speaking of their pizza, it is excellent!  Love how the mozz cheese is slightly browned on top (ask and they'll do this), and their marinara/pizza sauce is second to none in flavor.  So fresh tasting and aromatic.  They must use extra virgin olive oil and spices like basil and oregano in it!  All in all, a great place to relax and have a drink and a great meal."}
{"text":"Originally I had written a very negative and bad experience review of Arturo's ....The Manager/owner's sun responded saying that though he admitted fault on many of things I mentioned he also felt insulted and felt slandered. Well here is a more objective review.... Let me start by first summarizing my experience again. I went there with a big group. We arrived in two smaller groups. The first group to arrive had already had their drinks served to them by the time we(the second group) arrived. Our Group the second group sat down and was not approached by the same server. We got a different server. Who was not attentive. She got the wrong drinks.. Mixed up salad orders and went out for a smoke mid service allowing our food to sit under the warming lamp eventually getting cold... All this while we as the customer were told that our order was not out yet because that dish takes longer or was put in after. In reality it was ready just sitting under the heating lamp waiting to be served. It also gave many people in the group sickness after eating it. While there, we noticed the bartender coming out from around the bar and sitting with the customers as they drank and having a drink themselves... The manager/owner responded to these complaints by stating that one the server whom we had whom was not good was terminated shortly after our experience. Two that it is possible the bartender was off duty and was just sitting down to have a drink with some friends after work....   in regards to the server being terminated... Okay point made   In regards to the bartender being off the clock or off duty a few things to mention  One we actually watched them serve drinks from behind the bar then come around to the front of the bar and sit with friends and drink... then go back behind the bar and start serving drinks again.  Now if they were off the clock it then becomes rude and a health inspector would ask how they would know if they are off the clock. We knew this person was a bartender and worked there by two things.. One we saw them behind the bar... Two they were wearing an Arturo's t-shirt. So even if they clocked out on register  behind the bar there was no indication that they were no longer on clock. A health inspector  say thats nice but they still have your shirt on so it looks like they work there. Also from a sanitation stand point your worker who may have washed their hands before serving now has sat down in front of the bar touched the bar rim and began serving again without washing hands... the bar may be washed throughout the day..but even in an hour the bar can have numerous contaminants which are now on their hand.   In my previous review I mentioned that it seemed odd that the place which had just had a fire... a breaker fire not a grease fire seemed to be using many of its old items that were not damaged from the old place... One item I mentioned were the kitchen doors... Located in the same spot... I felt as though the doors were the same because 1. they were heavily heavily worn.... 2. If they were brand new doors the owner must have been going for a worn homey feel as the signs on the doors that indicate which door is for what were faded almost beyond recognition.    In defense of his new place the manager/owner's son mentioned that famous dave's BBQ which is in the old chi Chi's spot still uses Chi's Chi's equipment. First of all there is nothing wrong with using old equipment as long as it is kept clean. Second of all Arturo's markets itself as a Bar and Grille... This means that its primary reason for existing and making money is a bar... with some grilled food... Arturo's is not a restaurant in a comparable sense to Famous Dave's.  The Manager/Owner's son also made the comment that Arturo's couldn't have been doing that poorly if it managed to survive as a restaurant in a city  that was once in the book of world records for the number of restaurants.   Once again I say Arturo's is not marketed as a restaurant but a bar... thusly it is not comparable with the likes of Famous Dave's BBQ and others... Its market and major competition was Slam Jam's, was Pepper Joe's and is FatHead's. These are places that serve food but really are more about the bar.   Perhaps his other locations such as Art's in Fairview can be considered restaurant but not Arturo's.   In regards to the comments about the servers themselves and the place being burned down with the residents singing around it... I will admit that was cruel mean and opinionated when a review should be  unbiased. This is why I posted this one an honest review coupled with my response to the manager and son of owner's claims and concerns I appreciate the response as it shows you do care.... but my concerns are warranted and I do know the history of North Olmsted and many of the legal sanitation laws. As I am in school to be a sanitarian. Thank you again for your respond mr. manager and owner. May you and your following enjoy many years of mediocrity"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the 4 stars are for the pizza only. If I had to rate the restaurant and the rest of the menu, I would give it only 3 stars. Arturo's has the best pizza in North Olmsted, hands down. The crust is crispy on the outside, chewey on the inside, not too thick, just the right amount of sauce, and the cheese and toppings are just right (for my tastes, obviously). The prices are reasonable, especially with the coupons they put in the town money saver. I got a sheet pizza for my birthday for $20! Score!  NOW- THE RESTAURANT.... Meh. I tend to stick with the pizza, but I have had their chicken sandwich, poppers, fries, and the french dip sandwich. The chicken sandwich was pretty good, surprisingly. But when I dined in, I got the french dip and it was so lame. Plain, dry beef on a sandwich bun, and some au jus. I can't even remember if there was cheese on the thing.... it was so plain and sad and cheap-looking (for like 7 bucks?) The inside atmosphere seems to be very laid back, almost to a fault. like, they don't really care if you're there or not. although we didn't receive \"bad\" service per se.  I have no opinion on the bar service, as I have never drank there.  SO If you want some kick-ass pizza delivered fast and fresh, go for Arturos. If you want to go sit down and eat at a restaurant, there are a jillion other places to try and you'll be happier with."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried this place a few times, the food has always been delicious , good service and pricing..... However, what I love the most is that their full menu is available for delivery...!!  It's sort of become a guilty pleasure for us.  On those days when you don't want to go out, and you haven't grocery shopped.... You can have a steak, pork chops, or even fish dinners delivered right to your door!  A busy lifestyle demands options like this...  I'll be keeping this place on speed dial."}
{"text":"Went here for the fist time for a work Christmas party and it was great!  Food was served quickly despite the large amount of people there (there was also a high school reunion there also ), and it was great!  We sat around the bar area and I was also impressed with how reasonably priced everything was.  A great spot to grab a couple drink and hang out.  Great for large groups!"}
{"text":"This is likely going to be our new favorite local spot. Arturo's is a bar with a restaurant feel. Or wait, maybe it's a restaurant with a bar in the middle? At any rate, the food is what makes this place special. I had an amazing pizza- cooked perfect , classic sauce, excellent crust. I loved my salad too. Fiancée had a pastrami sandwich and enjoyed a very generous portion.   Our service was great and the bill was affordable. We will be back soon mostly because the menu was so impressive we want to try more!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! If your looking for fantastic homemade pizza, your search has ended. This pizza is incredible. Fresh homemade dough and sauce. Beats the cookie cutter pizza joints by a mile. Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"One star is too many for this place. I walked in with my husband and friend, sat at the bar, my friend asked what the specials were. A bald man replied with a nasty attitude. He told us the wing special. We asked about drinks, he replied and told us, with an attitude. Then he tosses small menus at our booth and said \"those are dinner specials if you want a meal\", while walking away. Didn't ask us what we would like to drink. We got up and walked out."}
