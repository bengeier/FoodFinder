{"text":"100% Vegan  Besides the vegan Poutine I ate during my stay in Montreal, the next best thing was the breakfast sandwich with tempeh bacon from Resonance. I'm not a huge fan of tempeh, but this house-made stuff was baked and seasoned to perfection. The grilled panini style sandwich has tofu scramble, sliced tomato and cashew cheese, all between fresh bread from a local bakery (can't remember which). I also got a cappuccino, prepared artfully by the well-mannered barista from Kentucky.   The place has jazz music every night, but unfortunately was not able to get here for a show. Though, I can easily see it being my favorite place to eat and listen to live music.   When I leave Montreal to go back to the states, this place alone will definitely bring me back to this great city."}
{"text":"Le lieu n'est pas évident à voir car en contre-bas dans la rue, cela n'est pas très invitant mais honnêtement une fois à l'intérieur c'est assez grand, la déco est simple mais le service est très professionnel. Mais mon grand coup de cur va pour leur café : j'ai pris un café filtre pour tester (habituellement je suis plutôt déçue et souvent ça a peu d'intérêt) mais là franchement, il était vraiment délicieux. Autre bon point, c'est que bien que ce soit un café vegan, il offre également du lait de vache pour les clients qui ne le sont pas, bravo!"}
{"text":"I reviewed this café originally about a year ago and gave it 4 stars, naming a few minor critiques. But now, after having been here a few dozen times, I feel compelled to re-write my review and add another star. It is my opinion that since first opening, this café has worked out the kinks and really upped their game, all while keeping portions generous and the food delicious. Basically, it is my favourite place to eat with a friend or study for exams in the Mile End.   FOOD:   This is a vegan café. They serve a small but fierce menu of rice bowls, sandwiches, soups, salads and baked goods. My personal favourites are the BLT (tempeh bacon!!!), the caesar salad and the channa bowl. I have also tried their chill, which is excellent and their guacamole is very rich and delicious. All of their portions are fair for the price and the quality of food is top-notch. It's not fancy or showy, but it tastes amazing and you feel good after eating it.   They also have a pretty great menu of beverages, including some good quality loose leaf teas, homemade lemonade and good smoothies.   Oh and they just added vegan soft serve ice cream to the menu!!! Just in time for summer :)   ATMOSPHERE / STAFF  It is a giant place decorated casually, very homey and down to earth. Lots of spots with power outlets. The music is generally jazz or other instrumental stuff. So really, the place is a dream for studying or chatting with a buddy. It's a basement place, so there isn't really much natural light, which is a draw-back, but they've done a good job of making the place bright and cheery, very un-basement-like. The staff are really nice and generally very good at what they do.   They have live music every night, which is very nice if you are going to the show, but a little frustrating if you just want to have a meal. It becomes a difficult negotiation sometimes between customers just there to eat good food and the show organizers who want you to pay cover and/or not speak while they are playing their experimental music despite the fact that you are far at the back and just trying to eat with your date. Basically, i'd suggest going here early (daytime or before 8pm) and/or having back-up plans if you arrive past 8pm to discover that it's a packed house for a loud show that costs $8."}
{"text":"Le café n'est effectivement pas très visible de l'extérieur, il faut savoir qu'il se trouve là pour ne pas le louper?! Je l'ai testé par temps de pluie et les places étaient donc chères?! Après avoir commandé un thé et des nachos au guacamole ( oui je fais un mélange bizarre), je me suis mise à la recherche d'une table, pour moi et mes deux amies. Pas évident, et les gens ne semblent pas vouloir partager leur table; sac sur la table, pieds sur la chaise d'en face, bref rien de très agréable?!  On est parvenue à récolter 3 chaises pour se mettre sur un minuscule coin de table. Je regarde un peu autour de moi, la décoration est étrange, froide, les murs sont un peu défraîchis, le plafond abîmé. Bref, c'est un peu trop fantaisiste pour moi. Derrière un rideau se trouvent une scène et un piano, il doit y avoir des soirées music live. Mais le thé était très bon et le guacamole pas mauvais, mais je ne pense pas y retourner."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan.  I'm not even a vegetarian.  But I would totally become a regular here if I lived nearby.  Cheap, fast, very tasty, and the live music is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to go to, You can go early and study and then stick around for always awesome music, Or go for brunch, lunch or dinner withs friends.   Its delicious, its cheap, its low key, and they have great music!  Love it"}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate in Montreal! This place has a great cosy atmosphere and super delicious drinks. They seem to host events (reading, musical performances) frequently as well."}
{"text":"I love this place. Laid back vibe, chess boards, live music every night. The vegetarian food is delicious and hearty - perfect for the Montreal winter. Great place to catch some live music, have a meal or a drink, study, or just relax. I'll be back...often."}
{"text":"They offer cheap, simple food, which is prepared with care right in front of you. The atmosphere is laid back, and the decor is subdued. The cappuccino was strong and had a rich foam."}
{"text":"Banana bread, hip, music. Breakfast sandwich with tempeh bacon & tofu scramble."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite places to go work. The food is great, and I have a special place on my taste buds for the Mango Lassi smoothie. The people who work there are awesome, and the music is great."}
{"text":"Open until midnight, quite a few eating options besides good latte! AWESOME! Also it is very spacious with lots of seats and tables :)"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. As a former fromage-lover who turned vegan for health reasons, I can honestly say that their cashew cheese is one of the best I've ever had. I had the grilled cheese (really good bread, Earth Balance, cashew cheese, +apple slices) and my omnivore husband got chili with guacamole and cashew sour cream. He begged me to replicate the sour cream as soon as we get back home -- that's a ringing endorsement from someone who eats dairy on the daily."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have very good, reasonably priced vegan food, quality and the service is pretty fast even on busy evenings. This sounds cheesy but they've really cultivated a good, community vibe. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Le café Résonance, situé sur l'avenue du Parc, était peu visible jusqu'à récemment puisqu'il est dans un demi sous-sol. Ils viennent toutefois d'ajouter une belle affiche en bois à l'extérieur :)  Tous leurs produits sont vegan (!!!). Ils font leur propre lait maison amande et noix de coco qui mousse très bien dans les cappuccinos!  Leur gâteau aux carottes avec crémage aux noix de cajou est à se rouler par terre. Ils font aussi des déjeuners intéressants avec oeufs brouillés de tofu et faux bacon.   Ils offrent aussi des concerts de musique tous les soirs, sous le concept du pay what you can.   Il y a de nombreuses tables où l'on peut s'installer confortablement pour travailler le jour. Ils ont même des rallonges pour brancher les laptop!  Mais on y va surtout pour le café exquis!"}
{"text":"For real, oasis aimed straight at me...  Just a little ridiculous that this place would be on the block I moved into. I've been vegan for 14 years, and this spot is easily my favourite \"vegan café\" in existence. There are others?! A vegan JAZZ café?? I originally came here to see a pal from out of town play a show, but came back to try the breakfast sandwich a couple dozen times. I'll be back for more, yeah. Also, the carrot cake is perfection. The homemade almond/coconut milk works real well in the latté as well, but I usually get the espresso. It works!  Please don't come here unless you want the best experience you can have spending money at a local vegan-friendly and good tunes-playing hangout."}
{"text":"Came here to do some writing during the day. Relatively quiet and spacious environment. I'm not a vegetarian, but do eat vegetarian food most days. It was excellent here, and I have to say the cafe latte I had with the almond / coconut milk was fantastic, and will bring me back. I am also a sucker for a barista that can make fun designs in the froth. A dragon! Awesome. Only quibble regarding my short stay was that the air conditioning was set a bit too cold. I suppose some people like that though."}
{"text":"Petit brunch sympa chez Résonnance café. Un lieu bondé de personnes absorbé par leur écran d'ordinateurs portables ou de téléphones. L'ambiance est un peu particulière finalement et pas vraiment le genre de lieux que j'apprécie côtoyer. Pourtant, les plats sont très bons, abordables. J'ai pris un bol copieux de chiliguacamole qui a été très réconfortant par cette journée d'automne et un gâteau banane chocolat classique mais efficace pour assouvir ma petite dent sucrée."}
{"text":"I typically go here on Sunday evenings for Kalmunity's Jazz improv night, which on its own is a great time. This time I came during daytime hours, and sans the musical entertainment, the experience was solid. While there isn't much of a terrace and the interior decor could use a remix, the space is large, and seats are easy to come by. I ordered an avocado chili bowl and it was great; slight kick with lots of texture and flavor. The staff was super cool and accommodating. They also serve alcohol for those seeking a shot of Jameson in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"Jazz and vegan/vegetarian food! Great friendly service and a nice ambiance when it gets full. I was just passing through Montreal for a few days but ended up coming here twice. It's worth a try, especially if you're an herbivore."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this cute, artsy, roomy yet cozy, just below street-level café in the Mile-End neighborhood. Playful experimental jazz played just quietly enough to not be a distraction, and it seemed like a good place to settle in and get some work or studying done or meet with a friend for some coffee and conversation. The warm, cozy vibe would be particularly attractive on a bitterly cold mid-winter afternoon.   Resonance was fairly crowded on the Tuesday afternoon I was there, but not so much so that we had to fight for a seat. And Mac lovers, take note: this place is for you. You think I'm kidding? It was like some kind of covert Apple advertising scheme. It's amazing I didn't get kicked out with my tiny Gateway joke-for-a-computer. The only infinitesimal criticism I have about the atmosphere is that my friend and I wanted to sit on the stools in the front window and get an ounce of Vitamin D, but there weren't any outlets there.   As far as food and drink is concerned, though they had an amazing selection of smoothies (many with espresso and chocolate in addition to fruit), I opted for the Rooibos latte. Big mistake. Though it was beautifully presented and exuded cinnamon from the moment it was set on the table, it tasted funny, as though the barista had had a heavy hand with the saccharin (though I hope that there wasn't actually saccharin in it). Since I don't really drink Rooibos tea, it's impossible for me to say if it's the Rooibos flavor I didn't like or if it the latte just wasn't good. I'll give Resonance the benefit of the doubt and assume that I just don't like Rooibos. But if you're a hard-core Rooibos fan, by all means, go ahead and order it.  My friend, on the other hand, lucked out. He ordered the $8 soup of the day, which turned out to be Spicy Mexican. It was thick, tomato-based, resonant with garlic and black pepper, and had quite a kick in addition to a generous portion of corn tortilla chips. If it's the soup of the day again, I'd highly recommend getting it. Great way to ward off the cold."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden and u have to walk down steps to find it, the tables are a little small but it is a cafe after all and not a restaurant. However, the food is GREAT! My friends and I split a few dishes and got dessert and everyone was truly incredible, plus, the prices are low too. The ambiance is good and they have live music. A great vegan spot :-)"}
{"text":"Cool underground cafe entirely vegan! So convenient for not worrying about getting something with animal products in your food. The carrot cake is super moist and tasty. Try the breakfast sandwich and the vege pate!"}
{"text":"When you feel like you need a break from poutine and smoked meat, this place offer some great vegetarian/vegan options that aren't just salads. I had the Victoria bowl which had brown rice, pickled carrots, kimchi, cucumbers, tofu, and a soy-sesame based dressing. I ordered for pick up so I was able to walk in, pay, and walk out in no time."}
{"text":"Never thought a vegan cafe with live music will be the first Jazz/ Blues restaurant I visit in Montreal.   I have just moved to lovely Montreal few weeks ago, and I know Montreal is just a place with tons of awesome Jazz restaurants/cafes. I am glad Résonance Café is the first one I try.  I will be happy to come here several times a week, enjoy the healthy tasty foods with great live music after work. mm, sounds like a good plan."}
{"text":"Ordered a latté and opted to try the house blend milk (a combination of almond and coconut) - it was awesome! I also tried a sip of the mango lassie. Great as well."}
{"text":"Je suis passée plusieurs fois devant avant de m'y arrêter ; ça avait l'air petit de l'extérieur et pas tant invitant. Mais nourriture végétalienne? Il fallait que j'aille voir ça de plus près. Lorsqu'on rentre, on réalise que c'est beaucoup plus grand que ça en a l'air; pas énormément de soleil ni très coloré, mais il y a une scène avec un drum et un piano tout au fond (le café est ouvert jusqu'à tard, il s'y donne régulièrement des concerts et ils servent de la bière aussi!) des divans, des jeux d'échecs et assez de luminosité pour donner une atmosphère agréable. Je revenais de déjeuner alors une fois rentrée je réalise que finalement je n'ai pas très faim, mais j'aimais bien l'ambiance alors je suis restée pour tester leur café.   J'ai pris un Cortado, un expresso légèrement coupé par du lait, ce dernier étant aux amandes et fait maison. Coup de foudre dès la première gorgée: ça commence avec un goût de cacao prononcé mais très bref qui laisse place à une saveur semblable au beurre, avec l'amertume de l'expresso en fin de gorgée.  Je repars sous le charme et un smoothie PB&J à la main (je cède facilement aux tentations) en me faisant la promesse de revenir le lendemain pour gouter à leur menu du diner.  Finalement niveau nourriture, on reste dans la moyenne; le menu est original, mais les saveurs ne sont pas à tout casser. J'ai goûté au fromage de cajou et au sandwich thaï (PB, cornichon, coriandre et noix de coco) avec la salade de kimchi (demandez un verre d'eau, c'est épicé!). Pour le sandwich, c'était bien mais je m'attendais à plus. Mais j'aime tellement l'ambiance que je vais leur donner une dernière chance et revenir goûter leur bols qui sentent TELLEMENT BON!   Justement, au niveau de l'ambiance, c'est parfait pour venir y passer la journée pour étudier ou flâner sur internet. Il y a des prises sous toutes les tables pour brancher nos ordinateurs et la musique est vraiment agréable. On y alterne le jazz et l'instrumental genre trip hop et électro, un peu à la Bonobo; je crois que c'est un des aspect que j'ai le plus apprécié. Avec le wifi gratuit et leur excellent café, il ne leur manque que l'aspect nourriture à combler! Mais encore une fois, peut être que ma prochaine visite va me convaincre de leur donner la fameuse 5e étoile..!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, live music was enjoyable.   Had the mac and cheese and really enjoyed it. Ordered some tea and it was good."}
{"text":"If I was rating this place on their smoothies alone it would get 5stars. Where can you get a delicious, filling smoothie in this town for under $7 anymore?! Right here! But! I have only got them to go cos I'm personally not into the basement dimly lit vibe, nor being surrounded by people on their laptops. But! If you like those things or are looking for somewhere to work - this could be for you!  I won't beat around the bush here - but if you're not into the scene of eating salads out of a mason jar this place is probably not for you.  I'll come back and get stuff to go, but I probably wouldn't sit in - not during a sunny day anyhow.  Also music in the evenings. May be your thing also.... I was served with a smile and it was appreciated."}
{"text":"b3st v3gan brunch out. and good live music"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, surtout lorsqu'on a l'occasion de tomber sur une soirée où il y a des performances! Friendly staff, bons bols végés bien remplis."}
{"text":"I'd read excellent reviews about this place, many of which mentioned its environment being a favourite spot to work at in the neighbourhood. When I walked in, EVERYONE was typing or reading away on their laptops. Kind of funny. Not many people were eating but that didn't stop me from ordering the quinoa bowl (with added tofu, cost extra) and an Alpuka smoothie. Both were EXCELLENT! I did want the bowl to eat-in, with the smoothie to-go though and the guy packed everything to go. No matter, I remained seated at my table and ate in happy silence whilst listening to Little Dragon, the rain coming down hard outside. My only complaint would be the service; they don't really put customers first here. The cashier was busy chatting away with her colleague half the time--making their conversation heard to the entire café, no joke--only stopping to look at her phone the other half of the time. But I guess that is how relaxed this place is and nobody else seemed to care as much as I noticed. Come for the food and atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pros : Brunch cool et bon Cons : Le caissier qui te demande ce que tu veux et qui lorsque tu commences à parler ne t'écoutes pas et va voir sa collègue. Trop de gens avec leurs ordinateurs portables  Le fait d'attendre 5 minutes que tout soit servis en meme temps.  Bonne bouffe mais pas mon délire ..."}
{"text":"I still love this place but I need to update this just a bit based on the dish I had last night. I will say, the people working there are great, it's still a pretty magical chill basement venue for readings and music, and there are great beers on the list these days including tasty offerings from Trou du Diable.   But last night I ordered the Avocado Roll Bowl and while there were tasty elements, overall I found it deeply frustrating as a dish. I wish I'd ordered the chili or the mac and cheese that looked more reasonable. The Avocado Roll Bowl looked pretty when I got it, but it was a small amount of rice covering a hidden fistful of pickled ginger lurking right where you might mistake it for something you could reasonably take a big bite out of. On top of the rice there was a huge fistful of grated carrots, topped by a think mountain of mashed avocado towering over the top of the bowl. It was nearly impossible to get through the thick layers of raw ingredients to make a decent edible bite. Stirring wasn't happening in the small bowl.   Nice fresh ingredients and flavours, don't get me wrong, I just think whoever is in charge of the menu needs to sit down and try to eat this dish as it is being prepared, and maybe rethink some life choices."}
{"text":"A nice cafe that's great for homework, a good book, or some quiet conversation! Though tastefully decorated, the interior is unpretentious (a rarity for cafes in this city, honestly!). The wifi is great and the coffee (we ordered a dairy milk cappuccino and an almond milk latte) is delicious! I absolutely recommend this for students, tourists looking for a brief respite, or anyone wishing to get work done."}
{"text":"La nourriture est tout simplement excellente et surtout tres fraiche. Leurs cappucinos sont juste delicieux ( marzoco machine). Je recommande vivement leurs rice bowls"}
{"text":"This place is for people who like jazz. And also, there is coffee. People in the winter here are often wearing thick jackets and toques. I think this place has a nice feeling, and a man near the counter had a good moustache. It looked like France in the 1910s. Go here for a chai latte."}
{"text":"Great vibe, excellent coffee and delicious food. And, creative music every night! Not to be missed."}
{"text":"PBJ (sunflower seeds and almond) smoothie was quite good. It was made with sunflower seed butter (my first time trying) instead of peanut butter; both butter types are pretty similar - the thick texture was the same, but the taste was distinctly of sunflower seeds. My sister got Bol Victoria (a type of rice bowl); it was Korean-style and pretty spicy and tasty, but I didn't like the tofu much, which was too hard and bland for me. The band was playing on a Friday night we were there, and it was pretty good. Place is really quite dim though - it's fine for working on a computer but rather too dark to read a book (I sat at the front, next to the glass, so it was better). Just keep in mind that this is not a good cafe to read books."}
{"text":"Essayer leur bol tofu, algue, riz, kimshi (c'est pas mal coreen!) excellent!"}
{"text":"I went here to see the Big Band performance and it had a great vibe! The cafe was a cute little spot with friendly people. I ordered nachos and chilli and both were good, as well as their beer! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Order at the counter and settle in for some great free jazz. Liquor, local draft beers, coffee drinks, teas, vegetarian snacks or light meals. Service was attentive. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Omg the food is amazing and well priced. The menu has many cool original things to choose from. The menu is just the right size, especially when you're the type of person like me who has a hard time choosing! Staff is a bit on introverted shy side..Many many people seem to come here to work on their laptops...which gives the place a kind of school cafeteria vibe, which is not a bad thing! It gives it a relaxed, \"minding my own business\" tone. Would need a bit of love in the \"looks department\" but doesn't affect the overall experience.  I have a feeling the vibe is a bit different in the evening because they have live bands playing. Can't wait to come and check that out :-) Love this place and will definitely be coming back ! P.S. The Alpukat smoothie... OMG seriously the best combo ever!! Espresso... Avocado wow!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch after a six hour drive from Massachusetts to Montreal. Enjoyed the food. I had a vegetarian dish with polenta which contained dairy, but they subbed quinoa salad for me (I'm vegan). My boyfriend got a shrimp risotto that he really liked. Bread was complimentary. Overall, a yummy, yet a little overpriced, lunch."}
{"text":"Love their food and coffee.  Their special milk blend is stellar.  It's a great place to study and hang with friends during the day, and my partner loves catching the jazz at night.  They have created a great vibe and really has everything I'm looking for in a place to visit over and over.  One tiny complaint (maybe just because I have old lady ears), the music is a bit on the loud side during the day."}
{"text":"I should really come here more often - it's not far from where I live, but I always find myself going up to St Laurent instead. Resonance is amazing - the best mac & cheese ever, EVEN THOUGH it's vegan, incredible salsa, wonderful chili and a really lovely selection of teas.   I don't think there are words for how good the food here is. I'm not so hot on the cakes but that's ok, I'm not a huge cake person anyway.   I love you Resonance Cafe"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan rice bowls, lots of places to sit, friendly staff. Lots of smoothies and vegan ice cream too. Free Wi-Fi as well."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit ! J'y suis allée 3 ou 4 fois et je n'ai jamais été déçue, le latté tarte aux pommes est un vrai régal mais le simple café filtre ou le thé sont très bons également.  Les cookies et le brownie au chocolat succulent aussi. Mes papilles sont donc aux anges dans cet endroit mais je me sens aussi très bien dans l'ambiance un peu décalée de ce café. Il n'est pas immense et les tables ne sont pas très grandes, mais il y a de la place. Au fond, on trouve un scène pour les soirées où se donnent des petites représentations musicales  C'est un bon endroit pour travailler puisqu'il y fait calme et la connexion internet est bonne. Un de mes endroits préférés à Montréal !"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to order from here after several friends had recommended it. I would like to start off by saying that I cannot yet comment on the service, etc., as I got delivery and did not dine-in. Although I do plan on stopping by soon, for now my review is based on the food itself and the menu.   Firstly, although the menu may appeal to many, I find it to be lacking. As someone with Celiac disease, I wish there had been more gluten-free options. The sandwiches looked great, but much to my dismay, I couldn't order one because there was no gluten-free bread option. I was basically limited to the bowls.   The order came in a timely matter, which is always a bonus. The portion was massive! I had enough for a few days, but that could also be because chilli is super filling. My meal was good, but nothing special. It's hard to really wow someone with chilli, and I found the amount of guacamole to be overbearing.   I would love to see this restaurant include more gluten-free options on their menu...especially GF bread options for the sandwiches! I also hope to eventually eat-in here so I can potentially update my review! I would definitely recommend this establishment if you don't have any gluten-related food restrictions. Even my friends who aren't vegan or vegetarian love the food!"}
{"text":"Relax vibe of this place. THe Music atmosphere, the grilled cheese is nice"}
{"text":"A very hipster feeling cafe that turns into apub with live music. The food is a little pricy (under 10$ but not big portions) but its a vegeterian place with lots of vegan options...my wife was so happy. I would have goven them 5 stars but the service (for coffee) was extra slow. We had the BLT which was great and so was the house sandwich. Defenetly on my revisit list."}
{"text":"Superbe place vegan dans un demi-sous-sol. Les mets sont délicieux et servis rapidement. La musique donne une ambiance très particulière et inspirante! Quand j'y ai été il y avait du jazz et les musiciens étaient vraiment épatants. Pas tout à fait l'idéal si on veut discuter avec quelqu'un (on s'entend parler quand même), mais très bien si on veut bien manger et apprécier un bon show de musique live."}
{"text":"I thought this place was the bees knees. My partner and I visited during the day on a weekday, so alas, no live music. Needless to say, I need to go back and get the full resonance effect.  My food was delicious and the menu at large was cheap (a big deal for vegan fare in this city!) The coffee was supreme and the Victoria bowl was boss- more similarly epic things with kimchi need to be done in this world. Differently, my partner found the breakfast sandwich kinda meh so I'd maybe suggest sticking with the bowls? Go figure.  Oh yeah, the atmosphere was warm and inviting: you could totally bring anyone and everyone here for a good hangout and no one would be out of place."}
{"text":"A wonderful little cafe with great live music! The food is also amazing! I strongly recommend the avocado rice bowl! They really care about the products that they sell at the cafe. Disclaimer: I'm friends with one of the baristas, but I know for a fact that he personally sources his beans (and wants nothing but the best), and has been learning everything that he can about the roasting and brewing processes to bring you the best coffee.   If you're into jazz, or even if you're not. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Service excellent ambiance détendu sur avenue du parc. On vient de découvrir ce petit qui offre tout vegan. On peut y déjeuner et le soir voir un spectacle live. Je vais revenir ici!"}
