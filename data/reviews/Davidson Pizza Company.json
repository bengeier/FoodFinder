{"text":"Don't let this little Pizza Shop fool you...its the best most NYC like pizza in the area! Its worth the drive and effort to find them!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town by far!  The garlic knots are the best I've had anywhere and all their salad dressings are homemade and fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The folks working here were great, everyone was extremely busy yet still able to have a great attitude. I've only had their pizza so I can't speak about anything else. To me their pizza had great potential but what dragged it down was their exceptionally DRY crust, both times..same cardboard like crust. I think if they play around with their dough, oven temps or cooking times they could have a 5 star pie."}
{"text":"We tried Davidson Pizza Company as we really enjoy pizza and want to try out the new options in town to see how they measure up against the usual favorites.  The pizza was good to very good.  I think it would have been excellent right out of the oven, but the drive home took a little out of it like most delivery or take out pizza.  We will definitely try it again.  Important to realize this is a take out only joint."}
{"text":"Good selection of specialty pizzas. $18 range on large but very tasty for hand tossed pizza."}
{"text":"Small location, but great service. Garlic bread could have used more garlic. Ordered the Basil Mozarella Pizza. Could have used more tomatoes but generous amount of Mozarella which was quite good. Great service and timely. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Pizza here rocks!! NY thin crust but not too thin. Fresh veggies on top. Buffalo chicken za was awesome too. Great salad...fresh, mixed greens with the perfect dressing (vinaigrette w a little sweetness). Simple but satisfying!"}
{"text":"Just picked up our $21 pizza.  Pepperoni and mushrooms.  Well, mushroom pieces, around a dozen small pieces. You had to look hard to see them.  Flavorless crust.  Whole pizza very close to tasteless."}
{"text":"OMG the this place is a hidden gem in Davidson that i wish i had found sooner. We were recommended this place by a couple who had come out of their massage right before we went in for ours. Decided to stop in after and get some food we basically took the grand tour of the menu by ordering wings, Pizza, garlic knots, chicken parm stromboli and a salad. Everything was on point from the wings to the garlic knots to the pizza. The key is always get extra cheese. I will definitely be back and will recommend it to my friends as well."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Somehow I've been working a block up from this place and never knew about it until a quick Yelp search yesterday turned it up. So thankful I went because the pizza was great! I'm from the North so I definitely have high standards for pizza and while of course nothing compares to NY pizza this is the closest I've gotten while in the South. I got the lunch special of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5.95. This did seem a bit pricey for slices so that is the only reason I can't commit to 5 stars but otherwise this is definitely a place I would recommend!"}
{"text":"So today I went back and ordered a NY cheese slice and Buffalo Chicken slice...  After waiting about 10 minutes for two slices, I was thoroughly disappointed.  These are not NY style slices in taste OR size (I am from NY and am well versed in the ways of quality pizza. I also worked in a pizza shop in NY).  The cheese slice was dreadful. The quality of cheese they use is just terrible and evident after the first bite. This tastes like something an amateur made in their own kitchen.  The buffalo chicken was slightly better, but nothing to shout home about.  Both slices rang up to $5.41, which seemed acceptable until I witnessed the size and tasted the slices. Additionally the crust was terrible.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This place is overpriced and I can't even call it mediocre."}
{"text":"Wow, was not expecting this poor quality of pizza. Do not go here if you have a pizza craving. We were deceived by the website, which looks great. The pizza and salads look fresh. The prices are ridiculous, $12.00 for a personal 9\" pizza that resembled cardboard. We got one with arugula, prosciutto, goat cheese and a balsamic glaze. Nothing tastes fresh and there was barely enough cheese to cover the pizza. Everything just felt skimpy. Thankfully we didn't get the large for $24.00! The Qing a were no better- the chicken was very dry, the sauce was light and they tasted as if they had been reheated in a microwave. Needless to say, as Davidson residents, we will not be returning here. May be best for local college students, though it's probably out of their price range."}
{"text":"My review is based off of the incredible experience we had at the Mooresville location (same owner for the food), Ghostface Brewery and Pizza.  The pizza is one of a kind craft pizza, and absolutely delicious.  We've had 3 different pizza so far, and it's always a hard decision on which one to try next.  Met the owner and his family too...great people who really care about making you happy.  For anybody in the Davidson area, this place is just a few streets off Main Street, and worth the short detour!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just picked up a cheese pizza with fresh basil and half pepperoni. Excellent! Not too thick. Delicious. Also got a meatball parmigiana sub. Hoagie roll was toasted. Absolutely a winner."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite pizza out of all of the places in and around Mooresville. I have only had the pizza, but I absolutely love it. They recently opened a new location in Mooresville which I was ecstatic about. Occasionally it'll be a little greasy but I just dab that off with a paper towel and it's perfect like usual!"}
{"text":"We picked up some wings tonight, buffalo and plain. Both of them are not good at all, very dry and a lot of little chicken feather. The buffalo ones have black pepper and salt, and subtle vinegar taste. We didn't finish them. I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"I went to Davidson Pizza Company today for the first time in a long time. I went when they first opened and had a pretty good experience, but I just hadn't gotten around to returning until today. I had one of the specials 2 slices and a 20 oz drink. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the pizza really was New York Style. One of my slices was a veggie slice and the other was a cheese slice with sausage. Both slices tasted fresh and good. I'm sorry I didn't return sooner because I liked the pizza here much better than the pizza at Fuel. There are absolutely no frills here. It's a very small place and everything is either to go or to be eaten on a bench outside. But if you want a quick lunch at a reasonable price, stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"I am here in Davidson visiting my daughter. I am from NY (currently  CT) and I know pizza. Even CT does t compare to NY. Well the day before yesterday I experienced a great pizza only exceeded by Troy's garlic knots. Yesterday we returned for the sake of my granddaughter and feasted on crunchy and spicy wings. Fabulous experience Troy, thank you for your hospitality and passion. Richard Nuccitelli"}
{"text":"We have gotten pizza here about 4 or 5 times and although it's good, I feel like it's gone down hill just a little.  The pizza has gotten a little thinner, toppings more scarce and it's been over cooked the last few times.  The prices are higher than average, so it should be more consistent.  We will probably give it another try, but I'm really hoping for the way it used to be, otherwise we will have to part ways."}
{"text":"Ok- so, I am updating to give Davidson Pizza Company a 5 star rating.  I splurged a bit this past few months, and ate their gluten FULL pizza, and garlic knots.. wow! I haven't had pizza with bubbles in the crust since I left NY ( only someone from the north would know what I mean perhaps...) This pizza is so delicious, I would highly recommend this pizza for anyone looking for quality! (Additionally, they own Hawthornes, so this now makes sense!!)"}
{"text":"Tough to determine between 4 and 5, but the friendly service pushes it to a 5. As far as the pizza goes, it doesn't have as much as taste as nearby Brooklyn South, but it is very good. If crust is important to you, it's better than most.   It's also a unique experience because it's off the main strip in Davidson and you can eat at one of three quiet picnic benches (umbrellas included).   Recommended."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon several weeks ago for Davidson Pizza Company and decided to try it tonight. The Davidson location is very small and is Carryout only, but there are several picnic tables with umbrellas outside in case you want to eat there. They do sell some drinks as well (didn't pay attention to specifics). Our pizza was delicious! The large is huge! We got 3 toppings and it was about $17. Good value for the quality. I'd highly recommend it and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  Seriously confused by the people who say it's the \"best pizza ever\"... Have you never had a DiGiorno?! Cuz that's a thousand times better than this pizza. A simple cheese pizza that I thought was impossible to screw up tasted how I imagine wet construction paper with bland, cheap cheese microwaved on top would taste. It tasted like it was microwaved 3 days ago, refrigerated, then microwaved again.  They should be ashamed representing the town of Davidson with pizza like that.  The ONLY reason they get 2 instead of 1star is my husband actually loved the garlic knots (I thought they were too tough & chewy, but to each his own, so they get a full star for that) I wound up warming up leftover lasagna at home because I just couldn't stomach a second slice. My only question is WHYYYYYY- there has got to be a better pizza place here"}
{"text":"Davidson Pizza is delicious!  I hate chain pizza.  Loathe it.  Avoid it at all costs.  Will go hungry before eating it.  Which means I like to try all the local pizza places to find my favs.  Davidson Pizza makes the cut with it's delicious NY style pizzas and friendly service.  It's located in the smallest little brick building you can imagine, next to the Ada Jenkins center.  No inside seating but there are three picnic tables outside.  They actually have a lunch special with salad and a slice, so don't discount them when you're looking for lunch ideas.  It seems to be family run as the sweetest little 10 year old rang me up last visit.    I like the pizza, I like the service, I like how close it is to Davidson College.  My only meh feeling is over prices.  You can sign up for email coupons but I've never gotten one in two years.  The pizza isn't inexpensive, it's $14 for a large and $2.50 per topping.  I'm well aware that pizza is the biggest markup on the planet... a pizza's basic ingredients cost about $1 per pie.  I like mushrooms on pizza and one white mushroom sure doesn't cost $2.50 to buy.  Since I buy 2-3 large pizzas per visit a quantity discount would be appreciated.  But other than pricing, I really, really like this place."}
{"text":"They've got the best pizza in town. The service is completely unreliable, whether they're busy or not. Bring your appetite and your patience."}
