{"text":"The food was good,  but the new set up lacks the charm that the place had with the old owners. (And for a tea room, ambiance is just as important as food in my opinion)  They'd really benefit from bringing in a designer even just for an afternoon to rearrange furniture and shelf displays and make the place look a little cuter."}
{"text":"We were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.  The atmosphere is charming and the food was delicious.  The staff was very friendly and made sure that we were completely satisfied.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Low key, cool locals only spot offering a variety of tea. Are there Corporate  places that offer faster service...sure. But you're going to hangout and enjoy the locals perspective on tea, food and hanging with friends. There's always faster service but with less care. Take a step back and remember the old days with no phones...the time is now, make sure friends and family know that."}
{"text":"I was passing through town on a business trip and this was just what I needed for a break. Quaint and cozy and the staff is extra pleasant! I hope I can make it back someday!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Walked into a charming warm room like Grandma's house.  Tea pots and tea cups everywhere.  Got the last table, thanks to having a reservation for our group.  The menu is simple with a variety of salads, quiche and croissant sandwiches, and a soup.  We enjoyed our meals.  With our tea we had the almond and lemon scones.  Delicious!  Warm and soft, full of flavor.  Service was spotty as all tables were taken, and only two servers.  High Tea is available.  Credit cards accepted.  An unrelated bakery is behind the tea room.  Has a nice selection of pastries, pies and cakes.  Definitely, a nice spot for lunch."}
