{"text":"I had not been to a max and Erma's since i was a kid. I went to lunch on a Saturday, the were not busy. The service was horrible and if i order a burger med. rare and it comes med to med well, that is a problem. don't say your can do something and you cant. I doubt i will go back"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Nothing spectacular but I would go back for sure. Diverse menu and clean. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. I wish they had more chicken and vegetarian options. Everything I've had there has been really good. I think it's really cute inside the restaurant too. I wish they had outdoor seating too (maybe they do and I didn't know)."}
{"text":"This used to be my families favorite restaurant. Now i can honestly say I would NEVER go back here. Everything was bad. The food was horrible the server was even worse.  And it didn't help she had hickeys all over her neck. She actually rolled her eyes at me when I told her the plates they gave us for appetizers were filthy.  I should have known it wasn't what it used to be when every other restaurant around this one had an hour wait and here there were 3 families total eating there.  Just bad.  I think it's the beginning of the end for this one."}
{"text":"Steak with potatoes and broccoli  was great. Great place for a family with children. We came at lunch so it was a little noisy but not that bad. Parking was easy. Waitress took our order promptly and gave us our food hot. Portions were great for the price. If  You are looking for a family place for lunch, this would be a great place to go."}
{"text":"Saturday night, and it wasn't too busy, but the food was very slow in coming. Food was \"meh\" but somewhat pricey for this type of restaurant"}
{"text":"The sundae bar is a big hit with my kids, particularly the blue \"whipped cream\" (I shudder to think what's actually in that). The food's pretty much the same stuff you can get at Friday's, Applebee's, etc. I like their salad with the almonds and blue cheese-- they sometimes really dowse it in dressing but it's good."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant about 730. I was seated very fast. After sitting at the table for 10 min not a single server came around to even get our drinks. My wife then wrote our order down and took it to the bartender  (Amanda)who seated us as well. She places our order and told the manager. She then told us the manager would be over. After about 10  min the manager finally came over. He ask how we were doing. We said we would be better if we were being waited on. Then then told us it was his fault he cut the floor and never told Amanda so she sat us in a area that was closed. I then told him two waitresses were cleaning a table and asked who had our table at which time they both disappeared into the back. One of the two waitresses names was Kim. I then also told him that a table across from us had been there for 5 min and no one had stopped there either. The manager looked over and then said he was not surprised and walked away. My wife walked over to the table of 6 that liked annoyed and told them we waited for 10 min and no one came over. They then said that they were leaving. Amanda the bartender went above and beyond walking back and forth from the bar to make sure we were ok. She gave free cookies. She was GREAT! This is the worst experience I have ever had at any max's and ermas restaurant. If not for Amanda I would have left. If I could rate this visit less then one star I would. We came to the RIDC location for our anniversary dinner and it was not a  pleasureable.........  So after posting this review I on three different sites and sending it to max's & ermas. I got a email and then a call from the general manager. I was unable to answer the the phone when she called. I called back when I could and was put on hold for 5 min. At which time I hung up. So now I am waiting for another call."}
{"text":"Just passing through and found Max and Ermas. Good food, good service!  Enjoyed it. Will look for them in other cities. It's been a pleasure!"}
{"text":"Servers are very nice. Manager comes to table to make sure everything is ok. Always have new menu items. The giant meatball on the appetizer menu is amazing! I only gave it 4 stars because I don't think the menu items and the decor of the restaurant match up."}
{"text":"I consider this a dark and dingy applebees. 31$ an appetizer and two meals, not bad at all! The tables are sticky, the staff is polite but seems very unhappy about their jobs. Mediocre food, nothing I would absolutely have to have again. We had potato skins, Sriracha pasta, and half garden turkey club and Caesar salad. Garden turkey club was literally warmed up lunch meat and lettuce, gross. Seems kind of dirty and outdated. We didn't have drinks or use the restrooms. Overall okay, but probably would not revisit."}
{"text":"We specifically like to go to Max and Erma's for their fajitas. We love them. Our friends from out of town would drive and meet us just to eat these fajitas.  We decided to stop in the other night for fajitas only to find them missing from the menu and told by the waitress that they are being re-worked to be healthier and will be back. What a total bummer. They were fantastic how they were. They've changed the music they play and many of the menu items. Trying to be trendier? I don't know.  But I was highly disappointed.  Even the red sangria recipe seems to have changed. I don't think we will be heading back to see what they do to the fajitas."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite local chain restaurant. The burgers were big and flavorful, the seasoned fries usually hot and crisp, the tortilla cheese soup the best around and the salads crunchingly satisfying.  After two years away from this place, (the quality of the food had plummeted), my wife and I gave it another chance.  The interior has been remodeled.  The menu has been modified but remains much the same. The tortilla soup is as good as ever!  Sadly, though improved over the last few times we ate here the burgers seem average. I ordered the 3 course combo: side house salad, Max's cheeseburger & seasoned fries, Erma's chocolate chip cookie. The salad was inoffensive, the burger much smaller than the bun was boring, the cookie -whatever.  If I come back it'll be for drinks and snacks not a burger. Maybe I'll go down the street to Five Guys for that."}
{"text":"Only so-so burgers and fries. Service was friendly and prompt. Large menu and many choices. Nice place but food -- eh."}
{"text":"We have previously eaten at this restaurant and enjoyed our meals. Last night we went at my son's request for his birthday dinner.  There were six of us but the restaurant was not crowded so we were promptly seated. Our waitress did not check in with us for 10 minutes.  We ordered immediately as we had already studied the menus in depth.  Our drinks were brought to us pretty quickly, though they brought my husband the wrong type of beer. When informed of this the waitress did not say a word but merely turned around and walked away from the table. She did bring the correct beer order, again without a word.  Thirty five minutes later we had to complain to the hostess that we had neither seen our waitress nor received anything to eat.  Again, it was not crowded as it was a Monday night. Additionally, there were several waitresses standing around talking with somebody at another table. Even so, our waitress was nowhere to be seen.  After complaining to the hostess, our food was finally brought out. It clearly had been sitting for quite some time. The fries were cold and soggy, my son's burger looks like a hockey puck, and my nephew's grilled cheese was completely congealed.    The waitress did not ask our meal was. The hostess did come over to check in with us and we were honest with her.  She told us it was a new waitress and that they should have had her working with someone else. Clearly this was a management issue since, as I mentioned before, there were several waitresses standing around talking to a friend at another table.  Much to their credit, the restaurant completely comped our meal.  This is the first time in my life that I have not left a tip for a waitress.  I would say that I feel bad for her, but she made no attempt to apologize or even explain what happened."}
{"text":"This place has gone sooo downhill! No wonder there was hardly a soul in the place at lunch hour! Today is my birthday and I could go anywhere I wanted. I felt like a good salad and some french onion soup. Their soup was always my favorite. Now it is JUST ok... But I got the Santa Fe salad and it was horrible. Dried out, tough, gross, tiny bits of chicken (like 4).....lettuce and tomato and cheese. What about this is Santa Fe??  Regular ranch dressing with it. The bland gross tortilla strips on top don't have any seasoning on them. They are like cardboard. No black beans or corn or chipotle dressing....nothing. Horrible meal. Such a shame! Won't go back and I am sure they will be closing their doors soon."}
{"text":"Max & Erma's is an excellent place to grab dinner or lunch. Especially for all of you hard at work in RIDC park. For what you get the prices aren't bad at all, and the chicken-parm is to die for. Full-service bar for after-work unwinding (But keep it reasonable, I don't need Rt. 28 any worse for wear than it is.) and a varying reasonably diverse menu."}
{"text":"I always like coming here for my free cookies on Wednesday because they taste like my grandmas. The cookies are always fresh and hot right out of the oven. But cookies aside their food is always excellent.  I recommend getting the hand breaded chicken tenders or the fish and chips. I strongly recommend going to this restaraunt"}
{"text":"\"Stranded\" in the area for a few days, we decided to check out Max & Erma's. We actually stopped into each of the restaurants in the area for a menu and settled here.   Boy am I glad we did. This is a truly unique restaurant. I haven't been to a sit down restaurant, with a bar, decent beverage selection that sells chocolate chip cookies and has a sundae bar.   We started with the Max Draft Beer for just $5, Blue Moon and Troegs (a local brew and first try for me) and ordered dinner. My boyfriend had the \"3-course\" option which was tortilla soup or salad, a 6 ounce beef burger or turkey avocado swiss burger, and a chocolate chip cookie. I had the philly cheesesteak and asked the waitress to doctor up my fries to their loaded fries. They put fresh and crisp bacon, white cheddar cheese curds and this delicious beer cheese sauce. I highly recommend this cheese fry option. The sauce is truly yummy and is served very warm.   We finished off with a light, quite beautiful pitcher of pineapple, white peach sangria.   All in all, I will definitely stop back anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Business travel, stayed near the airport and needed dinner. Yelped this up and got mixed reviews. Tried it and I won't go back. Shame of it is the staff was fine. Attentive and some interesting beer on tap. But the place was dirty, to my eyes, and the All American burger I had was disappointing."}
{"text":"Good eating, friendly atmosphere, prices are reasonable. Mellow music, more up beat would help but overall really good"}
{"text":"This Max and Emma's is hit and miss. Sometimes it is very good and other times it is very bad. That is for food and service as well."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had and very well priced. I got the tortilla burger and is was delicious especially with there tortilla soup!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Beer was cold. Got my burger medium just as I ordered. Good experience ."}
{"text":"Still a good bet with consistently good food but they no longer offer Guinness draft!    I found that they stopped on Saint Patrick's Day weekend!!!"}
{"text":"I liked this place,  but then they closed it without notifying me.  That made me angry. Chicken tortilla soup was delightful,"}
{"text":"Slow service, and poor quality of food. El diablo burger was bland and overcooked. I ordered chicken fajitas for 14$ salsa, guac, & all condiments came out of a can. The tortillas were VERY stale, and the chicken and veggies were nothing special."}
{"text":"Not ever again. I've been to several other M&E's and was always pleased. When we walked in the front door today the smell was obvious-musty, as if the carpets hadn't been cleaned for years.  I thought I might be able to ignore it after a few minutes, but no luck. I finally mentioned it to the waitress, and she said 'I have allergies-I don't smell anything'. I assured her that it did stink like old, dirty carpet. She said she would mention it to the manager and that was the last of it. Maybe they got busy in the back making a sign inviting 'allergy sufferers only today'  Food was just ok, imo overpriced."}
{"text":"As a Veteran, I thought I would see how one of these appreciation nights would be to attend! I choose Max & Erma's because I have enjoyed their food in the past! Right from the get go I was treated like a celebrity! My waitress payed a lot of attention to me! My food was delicious and the extras they poured on me over and beyond their generous initial offering were beyond my expectations!!!!! The place was packed and I saw nobody having anything but a great time and terrific food! Count me in as a regular customer!!!!! And God Bless America and Max & Erma's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer.  Got the beer didn't taste very well. Took one sip and new something was wrong. Waited for bartender to return but she decided to have a 10 minute conversation with her friends at a table. Walked out and put cash on the bar."}
{"text":"Decent service from the bar area. Music was just a little too loud for the highly obnoxiously drunk crowd. So - so beer choices but good glass sizes.  Salad was good but a little short on dressing.  Bread was warm and soft. Had the Laredo steak plate which looked like it had been under the heat lamp for a while. Steak was as ordered and the potatoes were ok but the green beans lacked.   All - in - all it was an average diner with average beer. I rated it a 3 but should be a 2.5. The best thing was the 15% discount from staying at the hotel just behind."}
{"text":"Attentive service for lunch crowd it was really busy.  Get the garbage burger 10oz Wow it was so delicious!  Glad they didn't go out of business and they're doing a great job.  Free cookies on Wednesday   Get there people!"}
{"text":"The waitress said...\"I put my finger in your soup, it was cold, so I sent it back to the kitchen to heat up\". She lacked personal hygiene and social diplomacy. One hour - twenty minutes for soup and salad. The manager, at about 45 minutes, apologized saying they were short staffed and \"fresh bread out the oven\" will be out shortly. No bread, no service, my wife got sick, never to return. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I can forgive myself for going to this chain restaurant because the tortilla soup is SO good!  It's not really a chain restaurant for me because they're not on the east coast :) I first had Max & Erma's tortilla soup in Cincinnati on a work trip - my coworker and I liked it so much, we had it again in the airport on our way home at 10am for breakfast.  Here I am in Pittsburgh on a business trip and having Max & Erma's tortilla soup...either I'm starting a tradition or I need to get my work to start sending me to more exciting cities.  The pick two deal for $7.99 is great - I also got a loaded baked potato which hit the spot.  The hostess and waitress weren't very friendly but I didn't go in expecting good service."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was kind of slow. Waited 8 min for a beer. Just very sluggish."}
{"text":"We have been here several times.  The food is very tasty, the service is on par.   However, the atmosphere is so dark and damp-like, it really brings the mood down.   String a few more dining area lights and youll be in business"}
{"text":"it smellz like poop and the workers have sex behind the counter"}
{"text":"I visit friends a couple times a year in Pittsburgh so I am always excited to try new places to eat that I don't have near my location. I loved the welcoming atmosphere upon walking in the door, and was surprised that the wait was only 10 minutes during peak dinner time. It was packed! While waiting for seating I witnessed 2 different patrons ask to speak to the manager and compliment him on their dining. They spoke highly of the service, food and staff. It made me that much more excited to eat here!  Upon being seated, the waitness (Elyssa?) was perky and upbeat despite having an entire room of tables who were demanding. She was prompt with getting drinks and bringing out appetizers, taking orders and refilling drinks. It's understandable that being a busy server you have kitchen staff help bring out meals. She insisted she deliver them herself which I felt was a very personal touch.  I had an amazing experience. The chicken tortilla soup is to die for, and I also had a baby greens salad. Next time I am local I will certainly be back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very enjoyable!  The Food was great. We had nachos and burgers. The wait staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Staying at the Holiday Inn on top of the hill and walked down for a quick dinner. I had the Spicy Buffalo Wings, tortilla burger, and the warm from the oven cookies.   The wings were so-so, nothing to write home about. At the bartender's recommendation, I ordered the tortilla burger which was cooked to a correct medium temp and appearance. The jalapeño peppers weren't too hot and the side of tortilla soup for burger dipping makes it. Very good burger.    The cookies are amazing as most warm from the oven are.   Definitely give this place a try for a burger and beer."}
{"text":"For the past 7 years, I have LOVED this place.  Their tomato, chicken, mozzarella sandwich is unmatched and absolutely delicious.  The restaurant itself is very involved in the surrounding communities: giving it a very \"small town\" feel in a franchised state.  Don't make the mistake of leaving without cookies. They're just like your grandmas.... Just don't tell her ;)"}
{"text":"Never Again!  We've taken a break from this place for a while, but decided to give it another shot and see if it could become part of our \"dinner out\" rotation... alas, it's not happening.  This restaurant is filthy!  The highchairs and tables are very sticky and don't look like they've been more than casually wiped down in a long time.  The salt shaker looked particularly gross and looked like it had been dunked in a glass of water.  The bathrooms were not clean and if the kitchen looks as bad as the rest of the place, then we're just lucky we didn't end up with food poisoning.  The service was not very good and our waitress reeked of cigarettes.  Though our waitress was apologetic when I received the wrong side, it was too little too late as she'd only come to our table once or twice before we received our meals from someone else.  It's a shame, really that this restaurant doesn't do better.  There is a limited selection of restaurants in this part of town and I really feel like if they took more care with the restaurant it would be a much more popular place.  Maybe we'll try it again in 6 or so months."}
{"text":"We went to this location, on Cochran Road, a couple nights ago around 10pm.  We ordered the wedge salad, an appetizer trio, and the wings (which I ordered extra crispy).  The salad came first and was pretty good but seemed to not have any toppings except for the salad dressing.  The appetizer trio came out next and was a bit of a disappointment.  The potato skins weren't that good- mushy and no seasoning (salt/spice).  Also, the bacon was soft and mushy.  The nachos were edible but nothing to write home about- again a little mushy once you got below the ones on the top and the guacamole was pretty bland.  The buffalo chicken planks were a little under-cooked for my taste but were otherwise good.  The buffalo wings came out last and I was happy with them- they were done (crispy) the way I like them.  The wings were what I was craving when I walked into the place- the void was filled.    The service was a little slow.  We sat at the bar and there were only 2 other people at the bar and only 1 table with 4 people elsewhere in the place.  They seemed to be starting to close up at that time.  It took about 10 minutes to get our drinks because the bartender dropped a wine bottle- so we had to wait for him to clean it up and hear his amazing account of the accident before being served.      I would go back again the next time I crave wings (because decent wings are really hard to find in the South Hills).  Maybe during the day the service will be faster.  I will definitely order the wedge salad again and the wings but will be more careful when ordering the appetizer."}
{"text":"Max and Erma's is one of my second rate favorite restaurants.  They don't have ENOUGH of food selections for my taste.  Yes it's a variety of choices, but since I have a limited food selection...it leaves more to be desired.  Still I enjoy the food that I am able to eat, and the ice cream sundae bar.  It's a kid friendly place, and last time we was there some woman was making the kids beautiful balloon shapes. (It must of been family night)    If your by one check it out...it's a nice place to gather and grab a burger or something!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on a Saturday evening for a birthday dinner. Party of 10, including 2 under the age of six. We were told that our party could be accommodated and the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which is quite understandable. After 35 minutes, we were told our table was ready, at which point we discovered they were seating us at 2 separate tables. We told the host that this was unacceptable because it was a party and we wanted to (obviously) sit together. We pushed the two tables together. The manager then tells us this was not acceptable, and they weren't able to accommodate a party of our size. We were treated very poorly and lied to by the staff. The manager was very unprofessional and completely wasted our time. Our family immediately left the establishment and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I have not written a Yelp review 6 months however Max & Erma's happy hour is so awsome I had to thank them in some small way. ...AWSOME. ....just go 3:30 - 6....."}
{"text":"Place was 1/3 full.  We waited a while before guy asked us our drink order.  We waved him down to take our meal order then we waited another 40 minutes for our food. We ordered the small beers an he brought large.  I ordered the Small Garbage burger without onions an got a large with onions. Took 2 hours total.  The place was not busy. Lot of other people were waiting for their food besides us.  Do not plan on going back"}
{"text":"The prices here are reasonable and the food is decent.  I ordered the shrimp, which was average, but the kids loved their \"big cheeses\" and the wife loved her quesadillas.  And the sundae bar is a favorite of the kids.  Wait staff are friendly."}
{"text":"OK...think of Chili's with a little less fan fare.  The basics are pretty good but as the other Yelpers stated, stay away from the fancy schmancy items they tout every once in a while.  Burgers, fries and a beer is a no-lose proposition here.  The staff is pretty friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"First time trying the place. On a need we grabbed burgers to go and my husband is picky but he and the whole family enjoyed  them. Will be trying the special nights soon"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess, seated and ignored.   After 25 minutes without a server, I left.  Will not recommend to anyone else passing through.  I don't know if all the wait staff didn't feel like serving one person because tips are smaller for one than a group or if they were just incompetent or just rude.  Extremely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Mediocre is the name of the game at Max & Erma's. Fewer food options than TGI Fridays and not as good quality. I don't even like TGI Fridays, so this place is scraping the barrel. Also, the decor is confusing. Is it a hunting lodge or gas station? I gave 2 stars only because it was clean and the food wasn't greasy. Everything else here is 3rd rate at best."}
{"text":"We went there the other night, the icy parking lot in comparison to TGI Friday's clean one should have been an indicator, even though the lot wasn't empty.  The Third Street salad used to be my favorite, but the quality of the chicken has changed.  I don't know gown they did it, but it tasted as if it were from a can. Even my coffee was lukewarm, just not a pleasurable dining experience!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and the service and food have always been pretty good. Today my family and I go there and it starts out ok but then just goes down hill from there. To start off, our appetizer was the new beer cheese fries. They were ok but there wasn't any type of dipping sauce so they were just kind if dull. Next our entrees come out. My wife ordered the fajitas and the steak peppers and onions were swimming in a pool of water. I ordered the bratwurst burger and it was way over seasoned. The fries were over seasoned as well. Then to top it all off, went the server brought us our bill, he brought it in a bright pink journal like book instead of the normal protector they normally use. Needless to say it was a very off day at Max N Ermas."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices, friendly staff. My son said it was the best dang buffalo chicken fingers he's had in years."}
{"text":"Service was way below average. While the chicken tortilla soup was delicious, it came out at the same time as my entree which is unacceptable. The server nonchalantly said they had to make a new batch of it. It would have been nice to know before it came out that there was going to be a delay. My salad came out with tomatoes, and I specifically asked for no tomatoes. When the server brought back out a new one it had remnants of tomatoes still in it so I ate around them. Once I brought these to the attention of the server, he never once came to check on our meals and see how we were doing. He never refilled our drinks. We also asked about the draught beer selections and the server was not knowledgable on these and did not even offer to go and find out information on them. There needs to be more of an emphasis on service. Even though this is a casual family chain, attention to detail is still important. Retrain your employees, specifically Kyle, I only found his name out from the check he dropped. He didn't even apologize for the mistakes throughout the meal when he dropped the check."}
{"text":"Obviously, you aren't coming here because it is in any way cool, or because of the 80's decor. You got kids with you or others whose palette doesn't extend past burgers and fries. These limitations can be overlooked. What can't be forgiven, however, is the shabbiness of this place. It looks like it gets vacuumed once a week, and the bathrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but only just. We ordered guacamole and chips and it was a little brown. This trend continued with the rest of the food. This place is on the way down fast."}
{"text":"Came out for a lunch run, and while they are a bit pricey for the area, the fresh-baked cookies made up for it!  They were very busy when we stopped for lunch. The waitress forgot one of the side salads, but the meal came out just as ordered.  If you are staying at one of the hotels nearby or visiting the hospital, this place is close, otherwise save your money and drive to Friday's or Outback."}
{"text":"I was in from out of town and went here based on the ability to walk there. This was a pleasant surprise! I ordered the Balsamic glazed chicken with goat cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli. The server, Jacob, was very friendly and his timing was perfect! The food was wonderful (well, the broccoli was kinda bland but...  it's broccoli). I really enjoyed my dining experience. Very clean, the decor is nice. And the menu is well written and easy to peruse."}
{"text":"Nice local restaurant without a \"chain\" feel. I enjoyed the brat burger and my wife had a gluten-free burger. We both enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Thanks Bri for an amazing lunch. Great service and a better personality. My burger was perfect and I really enjoyed my Tortilla Soup. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Hm.  Well, the food here was 3-Star.  Decent, but not fantastic.  I didn't have the tomato soup that 2 of my colleagues did, but they both said that it tasted more like tomato pasta sauce than soup.  My pulled pork was quite good, and so were the onion rings.  The drinks, however.... Wow.  (non-alcoholic, btw) took FOREVER.  The food almost beat them out, and the food wasn't exactly timely, either.  Very off-putting, and not a good thing when you are parched.  Two of my colleagues said this was atypical from a service and food standpoint, but as my only exposure to this place, it earned a solid 2-Star rating from me.  TGIFridays would have been better, and that statement probably stands on its own merits."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but nothing too special. We decided on Max & Erma's because there would be 6 adults and 4 kids and knew we'd fit and they wouldn't be too mad if the 2 and 4 year olds made too much of a mess. The server was good, especially with so many of us and when taking the little kids' orders. The food was okay, nothing too special. It's fast, reasonably priced, and good service."}
{"text":"The waitress was really nice but the food was not so great.  We ordered the nachos and there was barely any cheese and no meat and just a bunch of lettuce. They took them off our bill which was nice. The onion soup was good but the menu there has gotten a lot smaller. Not the best place."}
{"text":"Avoid the tortilla soup - it is quite literally drinking a bowl of melted cheddar cheese. Perhaps thinned out the slightest bit with whole milk. Topped with a hearty fistfull of deep fried tortilla strips and barely a smidge of chicken to be found drowning under the bright orange gloop. Likely the most caloric soup I've ever consumed in my life.  Turkey club was standard at best. It wasn't bad, but it could have just as easily been made in 5 minutes at home. Decor was tacky and the sundae bar weirded me out. I doubt I'll be back. Unless it was, say, accompanied by a seven year old kid. I'm not in the habit of checking out children's menus, but the place definitely seemed family appropriate."}
{"text":"Instead of a long drawn out review, let's keep it pithy.  While the food is normally mediocre, my last experience was worse.  The black bean burger with a wheat bun was dry-on-dry-on-dry.  The take-out order was screwed up, and it took twice as long as they said it would take.  I see no reason to continue to put money into this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is typically hit or miss. When it's a hit, the food order is perfect and food is delicious! But I've had my share of miss and that's when they've messed up my order or overcooked my food! If they address some of these inconsistencies, I can easily bump them up to 5 stars. All in all, they are family friendly and have lovely decor for dining in. We usually order the fish n chips and recently the crab cakes. Free cookie Wednesdays is a nice plus!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Max & Erma's in years, and haven't always had the greatest of memories from when I did go. This time, however, the service was great and the food and drinks were done really well. The chain I'd quirky enough to warrant return visits. Hamburgers are definitely their thing, but they're creative and generally well done so it doesn't feel like a grease pit. Prices were better than I expected for the quantity and quality of food too!"}
{"text":"Salads aren't bad. Beer is cold. Kids like the sundae bar. I like the banana cream pie. They have several good appetizers. Sandwiches and burgers are always good. They have call-ahead seating, which can save a lot of time. They also have outdoor seating on the patio during warmer months."}
{"text":"I got the boss burger for st. Patty day and was good. Everything is always good and never leave disappointed"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time recently and was pleased with my visit. I went with a friend and had the Thursday $5 burger special (includes endless fries). The burger was pretty good and can't beat the price. My friend had the chicken sandwich and was also pleased with their food. Our service was good as well and the restaurant looked clean in the dining areas. I will definitely be back - they seem to only have a few of these chains in the Pittsburgh area these days."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service, when we entered the hostess gave an audible sigh like we were inconveniencing her with our presence.  We were seated for over 10 minutes and never had a server come to even take drink orders.  Needless to say we left, and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in on a Saturday for lunch. We were seated quickly at a nice table in a clean dining room. The service was prompt and courteous.   I ordered the TMB Burger. It is a hand pressed patty on a rustic bun with sun dried tomatoes, basil with some sort of relish or tapenade and a balsamic reduction. It was one of the best and tastiest burgers i have ever tasted. The meat was fresh. I could taste that right away. The basil was fresh and the flavors all went together beautifully. My only complaint was that the bun was cold. it was supposedly toasted, but it ended up cold by the time it got to me. Not a deal breaker.   The fries were good and tasted fresh. I also had a wild berry lemonade. This was particularly good. It wasn't too sweet or syrupy. It was just right.   My husband had the garbage burger. Its topped with everything in the kitchen practically. And like most things in Ohio, lacked flavor. There was just too much going on, but the red onion stole the show. That particular onion was so potent that it was the only thing he tasted. He said he wouldn't order it again. He also had a cup of tortilla soup. Again in true Ohio fashion, it was pretty awful. I realize we are pretty far from the Mexican border, but this is basically a bowl with Velveeta and Pace. We will definitely order something different next time.   Overall, I'm going to come back and see what else they have on the menu and order something different."}
{"text":"The chicken tortilla soup is the best. It's simply amazing and do yourself a favor and order it when you're here. I ordered Tony's bodacious bacon cheeseburger, which was pretty delicious. It had a pretty good flavor. The fries were a bit salty so if you don't enjoy salty foods you may wanna order something else. Overall the food was pretty good, service was good too, especially on a Saturday night. I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Was in town  with  family  for  a jr  golf  event .  Stayed  at  the  Hampton  right  across street  from  Max n Ermas  so  figured  we'd  give  it a  try .  Saturday  dinner,  place  was  fairly  busy  .  Greeted  promptly  and  seated.  Floors  were in  total  disarray.  Trash , food ,  debris  all  over  floors  ....  def  needed  a  bus  boy  to  do  some  sweepin  if  servers were  swamped .   Food  was good , no  complaints  there .   Kids  had  steaks  and  i had fish n chips.  No  complaints  there.  We  all  decided  to  do  the  sunday  bar  with  toppings  .  Waittress  brought  ice  cream  to  table  and  directed  us  to  use  the  toppings  bar  .  Bar  was  nothing  short  of  a  cluster  f@$?.  It  looked  like  a  group  of  pre  schoolers  had  destroyed  the  toppings  bar  in a  food  fight.   Not  sanitary  or  appealing .   Good  food ,  fair  service ,  but  very  unclean  .   Makes  me wonder  how  clean  the  kitchen  was .  We  never  saw  or  were  visited  by a  manager  or  would  have  brought  it  to  their  attention."}
{"text":"We went here today and our experience was AWFUL. We sat at the table waiting for 20+ minutes and no waitress came. We flagged down a girl walking past, she told us she would find Katie- who was supposed to have our section. She couldn't find Katie so she said she would take our order, but she's really busy and has a lot of tables so she'll do her best(7+ wait staff were there, and they weren't crowded). Ok. So then she comes back about 5-10 minutes later to confirm our order. Then our real server Katie comes and again wants to confirm our order-which the first girl had given her incorrectly. At this point we had been there 30 minutes and had just received drinks and our orders hadn't been entered! We decided not to waste time and left immediately. Of course then the manager is tripping over himself to apologize and wanted to give us gift cards. Drove down the road a bit to Red Robin in Avon and had an excellent experience. Will not be back to Max and Erma's for a LONG time."}
{"text":"tortilla soup was tasty although quite cheesy.  mediterranean chicken pasta was OK but definitely could have used more seasoning.. servers were friendly enough. restaurant is clean, feels like a sports bar and the menu looks like that of a sports bar, heavy on burgers and fried stuff but with a fair smattering of other options..  this is almost the only restaurant in the RIDC office park, the coffee place almost across the street next to AeroTech has some food.. so if you are in the area for business, this is the choice. walking distance from the comfort inn via non-pedestrian friendly sidewalkless route in case you happen to be there.."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch in our way to DC. Great sandwiches and lived the chicken tortilla soup. Was brought out at the perfect temperature. Friendly staff and good service. The place was full; seems to be a local favorite!"}
{"text":"We are staying in a nearby hotel and were directed to this place for proximity and the fact it is open on Easter.  When we walked in, there were many dirty tables with dishes all over. We figured they had just had a rush and hadn't gotten around to bussing them yet. Our server was pleasant and attentive but not only was our table greasy, greasy we discovered when we took our kids to their barely passable sundae bar that the place was really dirty.  The light brown carpet was black and greasy as we walked past the kitchen, the sundae topping containers were greasy and dirty, the whipped cream was spoiled and upon leaving we noticed the tables still had not been bussed. The place looks like it wants to go out of business.  Yucky."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my two kids (4 and 2).  Kids meals are good-sized and the kids enjoyed it.  My trio for $9 was good value: cup of chicken tortilla soup, cheeseburger, and cookie.  It was a nice surprise that Wednesday was \"free cookie Wednesday\" so we got a free 6-pack to go.  Service was very good and they were busy."}
{"text":"We go here occasionally on Sunday afternoons for a good family meal. One of my favorite features about this place is the variety of seating available: traditional booths, high-top family tables, large round tables, so on and so forth. Furthermore, I have not had an average waitress/waiter yet as they have all been super friendly and helpful---all above average in my book! I highly recommend the three-course meal deal as you receive soup/salad, a burger, and a warm cookie all for $8.99!"}
{"text":"Super quick service!  Had a salad with shrimp, very tasty.  Easy on the pocket book too!   Recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Gross. We like the one in Scott Township so we tried the Robinson location while we were nearby. Service acted annoyed we were there. My pregnant wife asked for her steak (salad) medium/well and it came out super rare, when we mentioned it to the waiter, he acted super annoyed (that THEY screwed up). And the wait staff were all fighting/arguing with each-other and the manager. They really need to get their act together if they want to stay in business.  Anyways, I can tell you confidently that I will never go back here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone I liked."}
{"text":"Alrighty guys, buckle up for this roller coaster of a review! Must've been something in the water, considering Soph had like 5 cups! Fruit salad was solid, had better (try eat n park for a good fruit salad!) burger was juicy, and the fries were endless, literally! Copped a feel of the cookie, which was super soft and yummy, but not warm... that's an issue. The lights don't need to be so bright, this isn't Hollywood!"}
{"text":"After being ignored at the hostess station, I went and sat at the bar. After a $5 draft beer (and it was the small size!), the fish and chips was bland but edible. I've been here twice before and it just never seems to get better. This place is convenient to the hotels but I think that I'll venture a bit further next time I'm in Monroeville. Maybe you should too."}
{"text":"I ate there with a friend, they don't serve a lot in their lunch or dinner plates."}
{"text":"Meh. Not that great. The food and entrees are bland to me. I tried it out once, wasn't impressed, tried again still not. I just give up"}
{"text":"The cookies were hard and came out while we still had our food. Refills took forever and just really didn't care for the wait staff."}
{"text":"Another good dinner. Had the Cod BLT sandwich.  Fresh tasting with nice crispy crust and tangy dressing. Pesto Chicken Flatbread was also very good. The fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies and snickerdoodles can't be beat."}
{"text":"Max and Erma's is a solid option for good food in a fun atmosphere.  The decor is fun, a kitschy mix of old time photos, memorabilia, stained glass...and chandeliers! Service has been great every time we've been there.   The menu has your staples of burgers, pasta, and chicken; as well as fun new additions now and again. Tonight my husband and I tried two of their new dishes-I tried the bourbon bbq chicken, and he tried the new hamburger with egg and potatoes on it. We both really enjoyed these new menu items-the flavors and textures were well thought out and put together. We would definitely order these again! Our favorite appetizer are the potato skins. Delicious! They aren't just poured out of a bag and reheated, either. They're potatoes with real cheese and pieces of cooked bacon on them. It's a nice change from the potato skin junk you get at some other chain restaurants.   While this place isn't 'fine dining', it's a reliable dinner location with good food, good service, and a friendly, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Up until they changed the menu the food was great but not its a grease pit for the burgers and the new wait staff can't get an order correct."}
{"text":"Well, I'm on my way.. I've heard a lot of bad things about Max & Erma's.. I'll give it a try.. I'm not to excited to eat here.."}
{"text":"Max & Erma's is a place we look forward to whenever we go to Pittsburgh!  We love their meatloaf and burgers!  They have plenty of seating and we have taken large groups there and everyone enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Eh. It's okay.  I had a Mediterranean past and it was just okay.  The combinations of spices/flavors didn't really work."}
{"text":"My family and I like this place.  The servers are  good even when they are busy.  A few issues with the meal, but they were corrected quickly.  Great place to go for a quick bite with the family."}
{"text":"We used to like Max and Erma's but our last 2 visits were very disappointing.  (My wife doesn't ever want to go back.)  The chicken parmesan and the burger were not very good.  Prices are also very high with very few bargain combos such as those offered by Applebee's, TGIF and Outback.  Their build-a- burger pricing scheme can get really expensive very quick.  Salads seem fairly fresh but non-lettuce items are too sparse (they're overwhelmingly lettuce).  They give you so little dressing you can barely tell it's on there.  I realize it's probably healthier but the skimpiness has gotten ridiculous.  I almost always need to ask waitress for more dressing.  It might all be tolerable if the prices were lower.  But a basic meal for a family of 5 can be well over $100, which is too much for such a mediocre place.  Decor sorely needs an update."}
{"text":"We enjoy dining here mostly for lunch. The tortilla soup and burger combo is my favorite and I get it every time. Service is usually fast and efficient."}
{"text":"My first and only experience with Max & Erma's was a couple of weeks ago.  My benchmark dish at a place like this is their ribs.  The ribs at Max & Erma's in Fairlawn were outstanding.  Tender, very tasty, easily eaten off the bone but not falling in a sloppy mess.  The BBQ sauce used to coat them was excellent.  The standard compliment to this in the menu was onion rings, which are usually hit or miss.  The 'rings in this place were awesome.  Very lightly breaded, perfect texture, medium/thin cut size.  These were onion rings done right.  The dish was pricey compared to the rest of the fare - it clocked in at $20.  But next time I go there, I'm definitely getting it again.  And I'm looking for opportunities to hit Max and Erma's specifically because of this dish."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with a group of ten for lunch. We were seated quickly. Our waitress was friendly and very efficient. Food came out fast and tasted great. No problems with any of the orders and didn't have to ask for refills & condiments. My son even wanted to take home his leftovers- unusual for him. I'd visit this location again."}
{"text":"This is a hamburger restaurant, that's what they built their business on and what the emphasis of this restaurant still is, so you'd think they would know how to cook a hamburger. Well, sorry to say that they've forgotten how to at this particular location. I ordered a burger Medium Well and when it arrived it was about 80% pink inside. That to me s NOT Medium Well, not even close. I asked the waitress to replace it and she had the manager return the second burger to me, which when I cut it open, was about 70% pink inside. AGAIN, NOT Medium Well.  Then to add salt to the wound, the manager didn't even stick around to see if the second burger was cooked properly, AND she never bothered coming back to check on it, so I had to hunt her down to inform her of the burger still not being cooked properly.  The worse part about this whole experience was that when the manager brought the second burger to my table she made the excuse that there were two burgers like the one I ordered and the one I ordered as Medium Well was left in the kitchen by mistake and that they delivered the wrong burger to me the first time. So when I asked her to take the second burger back she looked at it and said that it was Medium Well. 70% pink inside is NOT Medium Well. So I ended up not getting anything to eat and I can only say that if you want a good burger, cooked the way you want it cooked, don't go to this Max and Erma's location because their managers have forgotten how hamburgers are properly cooked."}
{"text":"Ordered Nachos.  They had good taste, but the chips were broken crumbs and too salty.  Seems they dumped the end of the bag in.    Italian soda was tasty.  Service adequate.  Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but it's not awful."}
{"text":"Burger was good, a little under cooked. The only thing is the staff is either on their phone, glued to the tv or to busy talking to each other. Hostess took awhile to greet me, I almost walked out. Need to be more attentive to your customers."}
{"text":"Don't mind the map folks, this place is in the heart of the Robinson shopping Mecca.  It is located on the same Andrews Drive as Sam's Club, Lonestar, Don Pablo's, and Citizen's Bank.  M&E's fits nicely in the same niche as the TGI Friday's and Applebees of the world, however after today's visit I'm convinced that M&E trumps the rest of the All-American Grille type establishments.  This particular location (and the one in Stanwix from past experiences) offer a higher level of food quality than the same genre's competitors.  The service and value offered was great as well.  This time around there was three of us in our party.  Two burgers and one Club sandwich was ordered along with loaded fries, a Coke Zero (mine!), and Pomegranate Margarita.  As an appetizer a cup of the Tortilla Soup looked and tasted rather scrumptious, the tortillas were fresh, the soup very very very savory and my favorite part was that it was LOADED with cheese.  I didn't try the burgers, but I've had them before that their good.  Both of my friends thought they were rather good.  They also raved about their loaded fries.  Although it was said that the corn on the chili with the loaded fries was unexpected, haha.  I had their Club Sandwich...and darn was it good.  The bread was fresh, which I think makes or breaks the whole thing.  Ham and Turkey were salty enough to be mmm mmm meat but not enough to overpower the perfect amount of veggies and cheese included.  Unfortunately we didn't take a crack at the Sundae Bar or their oven-fresh cookies.  Mostly because the portions for dinner were big enough we took part of our meals with us to-go.  M&E's in Robinson was certainly a VERY pleasant experience...I'm looking forward to checking out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here with my husband and daughter. Server was very attentive, food came quickly and was very good."}
{"text":"I am typically a forgiving reviewer...by in this case I can't hold back.  This was my younger son's favorite Resaurant and we often celebrated his birthday and other events here. We always enjoyed the above average food and ambience here. While my son was away at college we never had an opportunity to eat a Max & Ermas until he recently graduated. For old times sake we went in June 2016. What in the past was a decent meal was now inedible. What a disappointment! The food and service have drastically declined. The waitress and other service people could care less. The place is dismal and its deterioration was best represented by the fact that their staff began vacuuming while the few diners were eating their meals. Max and Erma must be rolling in their graves at what has become of their namesake. My advice-- don't go to eat here"}
{"text":"Reminded me of a mom & pop style TGI Friday's or Bennigan's.  Walls were decorated with memorabilia from the area, but I liked it that it wasn't too cluttered.  Restaurant looked and smelled clean.  Food looked to be the usual family restaurant fare.  Burgers, sandwiches, fried stuff...  Kid's meals were standard chicken fingers, corn dog, mac & cheese, although they did have a grilled chicken breast and broccoli on there.  I had the half portion of \"nachos\".  They were gross.  Canned, nasty chili, but the toppings were fresh: tomato, cheese, guacamole and the requisite pickled jalapenos.  My mother's fish tacos were fried fish nuggets with all the taco fiixings.  Very fishy smelling and she said although they tasted OK, she wouldn't get them again.  Kidlet's corn dog and fries were standard and eaten up.    The highlight of our meal was the make your own \"all you can eat sundae bar\".  Vanilla ice cream that you scoop yourself, with chocolate fudge sauce or caramel sauce, strawberries in syrup, maraschino cherries, whipped cream and assorted candy: Nerds, Sweet Tarts, chocolate and multi-colored sprinkles, crushed Oreo cookies (might be a few I missed).  Kidlet loved it!  This was an OK place to eat that was very close to our hotel.  I wouldn't actively seek out this place, but I wouldn't avoid it either."}
{"text":"11/24/14 tried the Chicken Salad Hoagie with fruit cup. The sandwich itself had a delicious chicken salad with lettuce. The sandwich itself had a good flavor however it didn't have enough chicken salad in it to really try the flavor. The fruit cup would have been a delight had the grapes not been mushy and had to put them aside. The service was fine however the wait time was a bit lengthy from the time we got our beverage to the actual time we ordered. Overall score of only 3 stars applies to this visit."}
{"text":"The service was amazing backed with great food. The kids sundae is nice as well."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere! The wait service is excellent. The food is pretty good. The menu could add some things but over all i am excited for my next visit."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Tortilla Soup so much! Our server asked if we had been in before and since they redid the menu. I stopped her and had to make sure the soup was still on the menu. My dad and I stopped in for dinner because we don't have a location close in central PA hut we were going to the football game. We were in and out in under an hour. The menu is not as overwhelming because they slimmed down to focus on certain dishes. We had the Cod BLT and a cheeseburger. My dad ordered the 3 course meal and had the burger, a Caesar salad, and a cookie. I had a bowl of soup and the cod."}
{"text":"For 8:00pm on a Friday night in Robinson, the restaurant was busy but there was no wait. Our waitress was on a smoke break (we could smell it), so we had to wait a few minutes until our waitress arrived.   The Chicken Tortilla soup was amazing as always. I tried a new Gouda and Bacon Burger, which was interesting and delicious. The Gouda was melted so it changed the flavor. Instead of lettuce there was spinach on the bottom between the bun and burger, so it didn't fall apart."}
{"text":"I gotta admit. When I read the reviews, I almost decided to go elsewhere.  To be fair it was lunchtime on a Tuesday and not busy, but I found the service to be quick and courteous. The food was great, they were plenty attentive.. a good visit"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and this restaurant was close to my hotel.  I have eaten at other Max and Erma's and have always enjoyed the good food and quality of service.  First thing you notice when you walk in is the place has a very musty feel about it.  I sat at the bar and was intending to order dinner but couldn't get past the feeling the place was dirty and smelled like a dirty wet dog.  I had 2 beers and left."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a 'Max and Erma's (we don't have them in Dallas) so I really didn't have any expectations going in.  That being said, I can't say that I would ever return.  Ambiance: The restaurant itself reminded me of an Applebee's with random memorabilia on the walls and perfect for a family with younger children.  It was definitely alot larger than I expected and it looked like that had a separate room for larger groups or parties.    Service: Our waiter was decent.  He took our orders, got them correct, and did check back a few times.  Nothing special here though.  Food: The menu was similar to what you'd find at an Applebee's or any other random \"neighborhood grill\".  There were plenty of options to choose from and I think almost everyone could find something that interested them.   I ordered one of the salads and my husband ordered the spicy black bean burger.  Overall the food was fine.  I was fairly disappointed with the size of my salad (it was exceptionally small for the price).  My husband liked the black bean burger, but the fries that came with it were limp and flavorless.  Overall I think the food here is probably hit and miss.  Almost everything was under $10, but even at that price I don't know that it was really worth it.  Definitely a step up from fast food, but it's not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to spots for a night out with the kids. The food and service are always dependable. This is the best Max and Erma's I've been to in PIttsburgh. Good quality American food, and free cookies on wednesday nights. Oh, and it's almost never too busy on the weekend. Great place for kids."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat when in the area.  Nice options on the menu, staff did an excellent job accommodating our group of 40!  Will stop anytime in in the area."}
{"text":"The only other time I went to a Max & Erma's was in 2005. I was in Michigan visiting a friend who recommended we dine there. I ordered a Sangria, which was amazing and a salmon dish, which after the first bite, made me immediately regret my decision.  Fast forward 5 years, I'm at this Max & Erma's location. I'll be honest, I don't remember much about this particular location except that the service was awful. I remember I had to track down another waitress because mine disappeared for what seemed like days. As far as food, I ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Pasta and was pleased with the outcome. It was a bit on the pricey side since I consider this chain restaurant beneath an Olive Garden. For dessert, I ordered the Fresh-Baked Cookies. I don't know why since I could've gone home and made myself a fresh batch that would've tasted just the same if not better. I blame it on laziness.  I don't think I'll ever go back, but I don't regret my experiences."}
{"text":"Once upon a time the food at Max & Irma's was decent, unfortunately those days are gone, the loaded nachos had too much lettuce on it and little cheese, now with added chili might have made a decent taco salad. My steak hoagie had raw green peppers, what happened to sautéed peppers and onions? The apple bacon bleu burger came without bacon, we had to ask for it, when it arrived it was regular bacon, while it should have been black pepper bacon! An all around disappointment, will never go back!"}
{"text":"After a long day at the mall, we just wanted to sit and eat. We weren't thrilled about the bad reviews on Yelp, but we needed our tummies filled asap. The 3 of us had their top 3 burgers and the portions were huge. Each burger was unique and flavorful. Our waiter disappeared for a few minutes, and we couldn't find him, but he must have waited for the food to bring us, because the dish was piping hot. Even the fries were perfectly hot and crisp on the outside, with the soft buttery goodness in the inside. We decided to order the galbi tacos just because I wanted something to warm up the following morning and it did not disappoint.  Not being from the area, I had Swenson's just a day before. Although they were great, I think Max's outdid Swenson's and should be recognized."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited this place yesterday evening and were quite impressed.  We decided on this place after debating on what to do for the evening.  So after some time of research of the webs and looking over the menu a bit here we were, Max & Erma's. Being that it was late Sunday evening the place was a ghost town.  But hey, it's Sunday night and I don't exactly expect a full house.  So we went inside and were meeted and greeted and this is where the review really starts.  Atmosphere: It's what you expect from a chain burger joint.  Just \"antique\" stuff and other odds and ends just kind of laying around.  Me personally I'm not a fan.  It just seems messy and cluttered.  It gives you this feeling of the combination of a hole-in-the wall antique store that also serves food.  That's not character, it's dirty.  But you see that with a lot of different chains.   Service: Over all this was fine.  She was polite and easy to talk to.  Now what I did have a little problem with is the simple fact that I never saw the manager, and my question is \"why not\"?  Why couldn't the person running that evening just stopped by at some point and talked.  It's their place that their running and we are their guest so make us feel comfortable and glad we came.  But I have no complaints with the service.  Food: Now here it is, the best for last.  This here my friends is really the whole reason why anyone goes out.  The food.  And for me it was great.  We both ordered the burger special that they had which was a side salad, cheeseburger and fries, and a cookie.  We both did the up charge to the turkey burger instead and were very happy with the result.  The salad was tasty and fresh.  The burger was cooked just right and not dry and built very well, except both of our buns were just crushed and that was very disappointing.  The fries were fresh and evenly seasoned, and the cookie was warm and soft.  So after everything was said and done we were both pleasantly satisfied and full.  Honestly at the end of everything I was very surprised.  Coming to a chain place like this you don't really have very high expectations.  But it's nice to see a place actually meet and exceed those expectations."}
{"text":"Not up to it's previous brunch standards. Buffet has scaled back in variety and quality.   Still good but no longer excellent."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever been to Max and Erma's. We were visiting from out of town and went to eat with a group of 10. I called ahead and they said they would do their best to get us a table, but couldn't guarantee it because they don't take reservations. The host I spoke with on the phone was very nice, and even spoke to a manager for me. It was really busy when we got there but they were ready for us!   Our server was awesome- he didn't even write down our orders but everything came out quickly and nothing was messed up. Most of us had burgers and they were delicious. The kids also enjoyed the sundae bar. (Which coincidentally we were sitting next to, so they had an incentive to eat their dinners...haha.)  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We visited this Max & Erma's location to celebrate my Dad's birthday. There were 6 people in our party, including 2 children. We happened to dine here on \"Free Cookies Wednesday\" - bonus!! With every meal purchased, you get 2 free chocolate chip cookies which are fresh, warm, and gooey. I had the Tortilla Burger Combo with a Caesar salad, Tortilla burger, fries, and cookie(s). It's a good deal. The tortilla burger was very tasty with crispy tortilla strips, two kinds of cheese, red onions, lettuce tomato, jalapenos (which I skipped), and a side of their chicken Tortilla soup for dipping it in. My burger was perfectly cooked, and served hot. Our server, Ricky, generally met our needs, but with a side of attitude that he tried to pass off in a joking manner. He did a fair amount of eye-rolling, sighing, and complaining as he served us and other diners nearby. He could earn more in tips if he at least tried to pretend that he likes his job. The prices are reasonable, especially with the free cookies."}
{"text":"Bread sticks and tortilla soup!  Yum!  Unfortunately they took my favorite salad off of the menu (the Hula Salad).  As I'm trying to eat a little healthier, there aren't a whole lot of options.  However, I must say that it's a great place to go for drinks and appetizers or desert.  They even have a make your own sundae bar!  Oh so dangerous for my diet, but oh so good!"}
{"text":"Great place - I had the southwest flat bread - very good. The sweet chili wings were exceptional- I absolutely love sweet chili sauce! I ended with the 13st salad - everything was fresh but just too much to finish. My waitress Destiny was incredible- fantastic service. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We get consistently good service at this restaurant. The food is usually pretty good, but avoid the meatball burger. Way too much oregano and very salty. Also, I'm not a fan of the onion rings even though they're very popular. If you can, go on Wednesday and get two free, fresh cookies! Definitely my favorite thing about this place. I will say the Max and Erma's in Canton is better both service and food wise, but this location is perfectly serviceable."}
{"text":"Sorry M&E, there are problems here.  Since my first review, I've been back a few times.  Here's what I've observed:  - Last time, I it took FIVE MINUTES for the hostess to appear at the \"wait to be seated\" sign.  I walked into the bar, around into the dining room, and found NOBODY, no servers, nothing...  Had my sons not wanted to go here, I would have left.  - They don't seem to wipe the tables between guests.  That's right.  Maybe they brush them off, but my booth (and the booth next to mine) were covered in crumbs.  Just not good.  - Service is very friendly, but S-L-O-W.  When I combine these three observations, I conclude that this unit is just not very well managed.  \"Kinda okay\" is good enough for them.  Again, the food is good, but there are so many other choices."}
{"text":"Max and Erma's is one of those chain restaurants that you visit when you have a gift certificate, or in my case agreed to go to lunch with a co-worker who already decided upon the venue.  Don't get me wrong, this place is fine, I have never had a bad experience and for the most part the service is also good.  I decided upon the dynamic duo, it came with half a sandwich, I chose the club, and soup or salad.  I chose their Tortilla soup because it is basically like crack to me.  I can't get enough of it and hey the menu says guilt free so it has to be good for me right?!  My lunch mates ordered salad and soup and we waited.  That was the worst part the wait.  We ordered almost immediately yet we waited over 30+ minutes for our food.  The waitress though very nice, wasn't in any hurry whatsoever.  I mean it was lunch, we didn't have 3 hours to chill.  Overall we were at the restaurant well over an hour and fifteen.  Pretty long for soup, sandwich, and salad.  I probably wouldn't go back for lunch as I don't want to go way over on time due to slow service/kitchen.  Great soup though, maybe I'll get that to go next time."}
{"text":"Pretty standard lunch place located in RIDC Park.  This is a place you can come for a quick lunch.  Offers standards of soup, salads, sandwiches, burgers with a few 'Original' offerings.  They have a fully stocked bar, but I was on the clock so I just perused the selection, of course.   I have always found the staff friendly whether I was dining in or taking out.  You won't be blown away but you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"The place was a mess. I usually try to find at least one positive but here I fail. Tables and chairs dirty, the floor covered with food and other things. The waiters and other staff did not care about this and preferred hanging around at the hostess stand. Food was not tasty at all. My wife and I had stomach pain the night and the next day."}
{"text":"This place screams \"chain restaurant\" but it really doesn't feel like one.  At least...not entirely.  It's certainly a popular stop, as we had a solid 30 minute wait on a Friday night...and I can see why.   The menu offers plenty of options - from sandwiches to burgers (darn good ones) to typical entrees.  Plus, they have daily drink specials for those of us over 21.   It's good eats at very reasonable prices...with ample portions.  Honestly, a place with good burgers and \"bottomless\" French fries is always a solid option in my opinion.    This place is certainly worthy of a repeat visit or at least a try for those who can't decide on what type of cuisine the group wants to eat.  Good stop!"}
{"text":"I ordered the $13 steak with baked potato and cole slaw. The service was good and the food was excellent.  I would definitely go back for another steak!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived here after a nearby restaurant closed early (see my review for BurgerFI).  We arrived here at just a little bit after 10:00 on a Saturday night, the restaurant was mostly empty, we sat in the bar.  The server and bartender were very nice.  The lighting in the bar was dim, so it was really hard to see the menus, even the server mentioned that as she took our orders.   My husband and I both order the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with fries.   My sandwich was hot, and a decent size.  The sandwich was filled with steak, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheese.  It was just ok, not a whole lot flavor, but it served it's purpose.  The fries were just kinda warm and a little bit dry and tough.  I've been to Max & Erma's before and the food was much better.  I attribute our experience to the late night hour.  No big deal, the service made up for the \"ok\" food.   We'll go back, just maybe earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first time eating here. My boyfriend order stacked to the max and I order the Kalbi fajitas. We were very impressed, everything was delicious and our waitress was awesome. We found a new go to place when we are up there shopping!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Max & Erma's for a long time so when a friend suggested we meet there I was game.  I surprised that it wasn't crowed at dinner time.  We all tried the $9.95 hamburger that came with soup or salad, fries and a cookie.  Great buy!  The hamburger was excellent! Cooked just the way I like it and it was one of the best I've had in a while, the Tortilla soup was amazing, the fries well wasn't the best part of the meal and if I would of known I would of asked for something else, and the cookie! White chocolate macadamia, excellent!  Great value good food.    I noticed that the bar had lots of TV's but only had a couple of people ... could be a good place to watch a game ... So give the place a try and see what you think..  ; )"}
{"text":"I had the meetball burger. It's simply a delicious invention. The fries were adequate but didn't live up to the of the menu.  Still, good food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting for a wedding and looking for some good bar food before a night of catching up with friends. Max & Erma's fit the bill, with friendly service and an expansive menu reminiscent of Applebee's. We enjoyed the half price margarita pitcher and 2 burgers -- the bratwurst with sauerkraut and mustard, and the tortilla burger with a tortilla soup starter. Can't say this was anything like the tortilla soup I have made in the past, but even if it was more like a bowl of cheese, it's a bowl of cheese and I will not complain."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Service is friendly and very prompt. Food is OK. I'm not a big fan but I can't specifically say anything bad. I just wish they had more beer selections. Very good for the big group or for kids. Excellent reward program!"}
{"text":"The fare: typical American. Decent selection, served warm and quickly. Nothing spectacular but serves its purpose well and is as expected.  The service: phenomenal. I have a few quirks when I dine because restaurants/bars end up being my office- I need an outlet, I may be on the phone, I require an IPA, there's a nearby hotel discount, etc. The hostess, AGM, server and bartender handled everything with grace even if they weren't familiar with this and did everything they could to make me happy (Thanks Annessa). Plus, they did so with a genuine smile. The bartender wouldn't even serve a half foamy beer (my fave) and comped me a larger size of a different drink for my trouble. At the end of the day - this particular chain location actually cares."}
{"text":"last year in October I ate here. I was in town for the colts steelers game.  I cant remember my servers name I know he was a male. he was good  the burger and endless fries great"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I love the cookies and their unique hard to find desserts. I've only had the apple pecan chicken salad and it's amazing. My bf got the steak n shrimp and his steak was delicious and cooked perfect. I was too full to eat dessert but I ordered cookies to go and the waiter brought them out with our boxes and milks we ordered to go also. Service was excellent. We were in a rush on our lunch break and were in and out in about 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm just visiting Ohio and loved this place!! The waitress was hilarious and gave us excellent travel advice. She was great, food was tasty and the sangria was yummy and half price. Good experience!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Wife loves the tortilla soap, I love the tortilla burger ( it's awesome) and the daughter loves the fresh cookies and ice cream bar... I like that the cookies are FREE...(on Wednesday). The wait staff is always there for our wants and needs."}
{"text":"actually, 2.5 would be more accurate, but I prefer to grade up than down.  While working in the area, and unfamiliar with eating establishments in this town/state, we came in on Tuesday, starving. The parking lot had one car in it at 6:00 pm. This should have been a clear sign to choose another option...but we were tired and hungry, and it here...so we thought we would give it a whirl.  Service was very friendly and attentive (there was only one other party of four in the entire place, so it should have been regardless).  Garlic bread is served fresh and hot and it is good.  I ordered the Caesar salad with 'very light dressing'. It came drenched. It was disgusting, and I didn't even try it. One of my pet peeves is when a server sees your food untouched, and does not ask if there was a problem, they just remove it. That happened here.   Also ordered the veggie burger with avocados added. Veggie burger was spicy for me (but I am a total wimp, so probably not for the average person), but the avocado was so unripe, I actually could not cut it. Again, did not eat it, and no question as to why.  Sangria was extremely sweet. My friend drank it.  My friend ordered the sliced steak with a nice butter sauce. It was ok. Not amazing.  Hot fresh cookies served at the end of meal were good.  The place is clean. I like the atmosphere and decorations. Service was friendly. But I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Skip this one; not very good, IMO.  PROS:  interesting decor in the bar area  CONS:  Food isn't very good and its overpriced for what it is. Typical \"American\" cuisine with various burgers and sandwiches, but it's not very impressive at all.  WIN:  They have a handful of cool looking bar stools in the bar area that make you look like you have silly legs when you're sitting on them."}
{"text":"I live one mile from this M&E and lunch with friends here many times during the year -- most recently, today!  I have NEVER been disappointed in the food or the service.  Quite the contrary!  Food is always tasty and the wait staff have always been terrific!  We always time our arrivals a bit before normal lunch or dinner hours (arriving at c. 11:30 or 4:30), and we have never had a problem being seated.  Regardless of where I am, I always try to avoid arriving at restaurants during busy hours for OBVIOUS reasons.  My only disappointment with Max n Erma's is that they took the chicken salad off the menu. Aaaaaaagh!  PUT....THAT.....BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"We got the sunny side burgers, they were cooked just right and the fries were yummy too!  And we came on free cookie day!  Got warm, fresh cookies that my hubby scarfed immediately but I took one home.  Our waiter was superb!!! His name was Seam and he was so polite, attentive and friendly!!! That goes a long way with this family!!"}
{"text":"Dante's hell had nine layers, max & erma's only had two because no-one was risking dessert. There are bad experiences and then there are how can so many things not be right simultaneously.  This is the later.   We taxed the staff with a party of four, complicated by two people arriving later.   The first party ordered an appetizer and this would be high point of the dinner experience.     First problem was the coffee refill that never came. It was requested with the good order of the second half of party.   Or about ten minutes later.   The first two meals were a chicken salad and a black bean burger, they came cold.   The salad was skimpy on dressing and chicken. The black bean burger was not good and worse was the cheap tasting guacamole add the only flavor.     Second problem was two orders of soup taking 20 minutes, but when you order French onion soup, it takes time to Brown the cheese.   Oh wait the cheese wasn't even melted but floating on a slice of bread.   The chicken tortilla soup was awesome (something had to be right).  That French onion soup was a $2 up charge because it only comes in a bowl, not a cup! Here's the surprise the food arrives right after the soup,right after.   So the food is getting cold before you can get to it.     Third problem the Cajun shrimp & pasta should have more than six shrimp for $13.99 and the cream sauce would be nice to have enough to cover the pasta!  The other meal here was Laredo steak and was nothing either good or bad about it.   Well maybe the string beans should be bigger than a piece of twine.     A hour of meal bliss and a talk with manager led to a free meal. But att last the draft beer was good. There are much better places near here like Perkins, arby's, speedway gas station, ....."}
{"text":"Tad expensive. The ice cream bar is unique.. I like getting the appetizer combo that has square fried cheese!"}
{"text":"The service is OK. The food is OK. That's about it! My husband and I ordered the special where you get a soup or salad, burger with fries, and a cookie for $8.99. I got the caesar salad which was good. I could tell the dressing was homemade so bonus points for that. Hubby got the tortilla soup which is normally very good but this time it was just tomato juice with cheese in it. Not the tortilla soup we remembered. We ordered our burgers cooked medium and they were more like rare. We still ate them and didn't get sick or anything but they could have been cooked a tad longer. Hubby specifically ordered his burger with cheese and lettuce only, no other veggies. Well, it was a waste of time for the waitress to have asked because all the veggies were on his burger anyway and he was not happy because the tomato (which he hates) made the bun soggy. The fries were OK. I don't care for seasoned fries. The cookie was the best part! Nothing better than a warm, gooey, chocolate chip cookie. YUM! Our waitress was friendly but we could tell that she had too many tables going at the same time and was struggling. She did a good job at making sure out drinks were refilled and our food came out how we expected."}
{"text":"The experience all revolved around the terrible and unenthusiastic service provided to us by our server named \"Trish\". She was very bad at her job; we were in a group of 5 which seemed to overwhelm her. After we placed our orders I realized I forgot a detail I wanted added to our burger, when I called \"Trish\" over she seemed very displeased that she had to \"find her manager and change the order\" which shouldn't be that big of a deal, coming from someone who works in a restaurant. Then after she did that she came back and informed the whole table \"because I had to change HIS order, the rest of your food will be delayed 10/15 minutes\". Which was not great to hear, but it didn't really work out that way anyways. My burger wasn't that great, the grilled onions were cut too large and it was just all around an average burger. Then when it came to checking out, it took way too long. What should've been an hour meal took two hours. The only good thing about it was the free cookies. Poor service by Trish made it a pretty crappy experience."}
{"text":"I had the Tuscan chicken, and it was not very appetizing. The service was good, but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Went to M&E's today for a friend's birthday. Never my first choice but it was the birthday boy's decision. Menu is general diner food, nothing spectacular. The real crime at this location is the service. It was awful. We waited over 20 minutes for mediocre food. Rarely saw our waitress. Drinks always empty. UGH.  I gave them two stars instead of one because the waitress did assemble a crew to embarass my friend with a rousing chorus of Happy Birthday. AND we got free mouth-watering cookies (a birthday perk). If you go to M&Es go for the cookies and skip dinner just make sure you have a lot of time cause you're not getting out of there fast."}
{"text":"Crap service beyond bad. Pulled pork was dog feces like. Never again will we go back. Total trash food and service."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best, buffalo chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh. Even though its small it fills me up pretty well with the french fries which are also very good. The burgers are good, the salads are good, french fries are good, friendly service, clean and a all around well run store."}
{"text":"First the place is run down and dirty. Id hate to think about the kitchen and food handling!  yuk!  Although most of menu items seem to be prepared form can or frozen. i had the soup and salad for lunch. Tortilla soup is not the chicken broth type, more of a cheese dip for tortillas?  House salad was solid, nothing special."}
{"text":"Free cookie Wednesday. Yum.  Fish tacos were good but did not have Sam Adams special on draft. They were out."}
{"text":"Took my family to Ohio for a Cavaliers game and we stayed at a hotel near by so we decided to stop at max and ermas for dinner and we loved the food and the service. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night, a $70 order... forgot silverware  (I had a steak and mashed potatoes ), forgot an order of fries with a sandwich and forgot 6 chocolate chip cookies... Discovered the missing items after getting back to our hotel."}
{"text":"I can remember my son and I going to Max & Erma's years ago in Shadyside, for the fajitas. They have since taken them of the menu and replaced them with a toco version. I now go to Chili's for fajitas.   We took our grandkids to dinner last night, at the Monroeville location, looking for something different, and I remembered they had a great kids menu, and it was. The kids really enjoyed their dinner. Corn dogs and pizza with fries with both. I did not. The fries were cold and the burger was a frozen patty burnt on the grill. The cheese broccoli cup of soup was the best part of the three course meal deal, other than the chocolate chip cookie of course. I downloaded the rewards app and received a half dozen! Well worth it !   The service was excellent. She was not intrusive or a pest, yet gave great service.   I won't return."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their food! The Tony's burger is awesome! The free cookie night is even better! When it comes to the food and hostess they are awesome.   The service is hit or miss though. Most of the time it's excellent but if they aren't busy, the service is much slower. So I'd recommend going in right before the rush or right after, when they are somewhat busy but not crowded."}
{"text":"Came for a lunch date with an old friend before heading to the airport. Absolutely LOVED Lori the hostess! She was such a sweetheart and made sure we were aware of any specials and also good food recommendations which I actually ordered and enjoyed. Our waitress was pretty on point as well. Great experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I (along with our dog, Porter) were stranded on the side of the PA highway on a freezing winter night. After our rescue, our super tow truck driver, Matt, included Max and Erma's in his recommendations for great local eats. We stayed in a nearby hotel and called in an order for pick up that evening, and again the next day. The portions were incredibly generous and the food was filling and flavorful. Loved the nachos and crispy fish tacos! Our dog Porter (who lost his food in our roadside ordeal) put in a special request for plain chicken and rice which was met with such kindness and flexibility by the staff. Thanks Max and Erma's!"}
{"text":"This place has your standard American Chain Restaurant Food and the tchotchkes-esque decor. The restaurant is large, casual, family friendly, but also has a full bar and food/drink happy hour from 5-7. Honestly, my expectations were pretty low, but the food wasn't half bad for what it was. Cool thing #1, Apparently they have a sundae bar? #2, They give you free chocolate chip cookies. #3, They have fried dill pickles! The pickles were sliced instead of spears, so yay for that. I wish the pickle itself was saltier/dillier, but I enjoyed the cornmeal batter. I had their tortilla soup and village salad. Both were tasty, and the whole meal was $10. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good food and service.  I had the Chicken Mozarella sandwich. Good and healthy with a nice salad on the side."}
{"text":"This is a total rewrite of the review I did in 2015.  We  hadn't been back since and figured we'd give it another try.  Big, big mistake.  We were seated promptly at 11:30 a.m.  Finally got order taken about 10 minutes later.   Fifteen minutes later we got our order - I ordered a Obrien burger while my husband ordered fish and chips.  The chips for both us were soggy.  Had better at McDonald's.  Hubby said his fish was ok.  My burger wasn't even as good as McDonalds.  They use squeeze bottle cheddar cheese on the burger and very little of it.  The green peppers were good but very few and the same can be said for the onions.  If you want really, really good burgers go to Red Robin.  The music is loud and bad.  So, if anything the experience was worse than the last time so my rating went down one star.  We will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"Burgers are still good!  Tortilla soup is still good!  Not sure when they started charging 2.50 for each refill of ice tea.  If you want to charge for refills...then bring down the price.  Having 3 kids...the drinks and refills add up quickly.  2.50 for iced tea?"}
{"text":"Minus the fact that they no longer have my beloved Hula Bowl salad, I have to say that overall I was happy with my experience and fabulous service.   I recommend the Tortilla Soup, and Santa Fe salad (without cheese) that is for sure :)    Max and Erma's is one of those go to chains for lunch IMO.  Always consistent, and always good :)"}
{"text":"Food is okay service stinks. It amazes me how terrible the service is when there are 5 tables being used. Full staff unless everyone is a busses or bartenders"}
{"text":"The salads are excellent, apps and soups are always spot on as well. I really like the 3rd St salad.  The burgers have not been consistent or cooked right, I ordered mine well done, it came pink in the middle the other was ordered Med-well it came closer to medium...I sent mine back, they brought back the same burger only now cold char and dried with a new piece of cheese on it.  Fries are endless but served cold and under cooked so who wants them anyway."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I've been sitting here for over a half an hour no drink refill, no straw, still don't have my appetizer. The waitress looks like she has no idea what she's doing and/or is under the influence of something. I will absolutely NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first trip ever to any max & erma's. Shocking, right? I was shopping in Monroeville and initially had another spot in mind. On the way, i drove by here and decided to dine in since i had never been.  I ordered tortilla soup. When it was time to order, i smelled delicious bbq through out the restaurant and asked my waitress what that was from. she said it was the Cola BBQ Bacon burger so i decided on that. The burger has cheddar, cherry cola caramelized onions, bacon, onions rings and cherry cola BBQ sauce. The burger was great and extremely filling. I really wanted to try some of their dessert ( pretzel sundae, banana cream pie ect) but i was entirely too full.   i had a good experience here. Service was good and décor of the place is adorable."}
{"text":"Not real clean. Great margaritas but our waiter Derick was rude and horrible!!!!!! Spilled my drink and didn't apologize and left mess. Gave my dinner to my friend and looked totally offended when told it was mine not hers. Just switched and walked off. Did our check wrong. No apology"}
{"text":"Max & Ermas is very similar to the other chain restaurants (Applebees, TGIFridays).  What makes them stand out is their support of the community.  And their chocolate chip cookies!  My first visit to Max and Erma's was during a fundraiser for our parish school.  If you took the coupon that was distributed at church, a portion of the proceeds from your meal were donated to the cause.  It was crowded, probably because of the coupon, but with the level of service we received, you would never have known that almost every seat in the place was occupied.  I have visited several times since and had enjoyable experiences every time.   Even when we had a large party of 18 they were still efficient and friendly.  There are so many great options at max and ermas, but the best are the tortilla soup, burgers and salads.  I order the tortilla soup every time I go.  Creamy with a nice little kick and a crunch because of the tortilla strips.    Go on a Wednesday and you get a free warm chocolate chip cookie!  Prices are right for the portions you get and service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Eh. Had a burger and fries and it was eh. The fries were hollow shells with no potato inside that seemed to have been held under the heat lamp until someone ordered them. Definitely not fresh. They offer free refills on fries but they tasted like crap so I didn't want more. You get what you pay for so I didn't complain. The burger had little to no flavor but was cooked to the correct temperature. Next time I think  I'll go next door to Outback when I want a burger for lunch."}
{"text":"I eat here whenever I get the chance, servers are great and always make an effort to keep the people happy, be it coworkers or customers. I'm easily pleased but the burgers in my opinion are the best around, as are the starter nachos in either Max or Erma sizes.   Salads are top notch fresh but a little too \"cheesy\", tortilla soup is pretty much next to unreal and I HIGHLY recommend dunking your burger in it. All around great place to go.  P.S. Get the fried pickles."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. First couple were ok. This last visit was not so good. They changed the menu and there are far fewer options now. I had a cheeseburger and fries. It was not that good. Greasy and the bun was hard. My son had chicken tenders and they were ok. Fries were cold and soggy. Disappointed in the food. Service was ok."}
{"text":"GREAT Burger ! Loaded with Flavor, and ice cold beer. I normally do not visit chain eateries , but this place was close and very good for the money. Good job guys ! OHHHHHHH , Did I mention FREE COOKIES ????  Nice Touch !"}
{"text":"First time here. We started with the asparagus app. It's was healthy and tasty. I had the shrimp with rice and Cole slaw , he had the fish tacos. The tacos were awesome ! The shrimp was okay. Our server , Taylor was very sweet and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Max & Erma's for years & it's always been a hit or miss. You just have to know what to order here.  My favorite thing to get here is their salads. They are always fresh & I love to get the grilled chicken with it. The chicken tenders are good as well because they aren't overly coated with breading & the tenders are juicy.  If I'm craving fish, I like to get the fish & chips.  The burgers can be good....sometimes. They can be a little on the dry side if you order it well done so, that's the chance you take.  As for dessert, I do like their chocolate chip cookies if they don't over cook them. It's happened more than once so, just something to be aware of if you order them."}
{"text":"This is our first time dining here in over 2 years. The menu has been updated. There are not many dinner entree options. The menu is mostly burgers, sandwiches and appetizers. There are a few salad selections. I ordered a turkey burger. It was okay. The outer portion of the burger was very well done, with crisp edges. The avocado was fresh and added a nice taste to this burger.  We dined on a weekday and the restaurant was pretty crowded. Our wait for a table was about 15 mins. Friendly and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Loved eating at Max and Ermas Me and my husband had the Laredo Steak it was so good! Had an excellent waitress too great service and very fast!"}
{"text":"Thursday's are half price Sangria pitchers! Tried the Cajun shrimp pasta and ended up being like a Mac & Cheese with shrimp. Tortilla soup was spicy & tasty."}
{"text":"Mmmm. The Laredo Steak melts in the mouth!!! The after-dinner chocolate chip cookies are a winner too. They're a very good chain. I recommend."}
{"text":"M&E's rules! I had the Honky Tonk Burger last time I came here recently and it was so good. I love pulled pork, and they piled it on top of the burger along with bbq sauce. Sooo good. The service was excellent. I also like the bbq chicken quesadilla and those fresh-baked cookies. yum!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm......thats how everything was tasty. From perfect cold lager beer to fabulous buffalo chicken sandwich w delicious fries. And at the end.....banana cream pie, i mean i walked out probably w + 5 pounds.  GREAT PLACE !!!"}
{"text":"I love max and ermmas theyre one of my favorites to be honest theyre chicken tortilla soup is the bomb"}
{"text":"What's better than fresh, homemade free cookies?!  Well, a gluten free cookie, but whatever, I can still enjoy myself in sharing free food with other people.   Max & Erma's is like the place to get everything. If I'd ever been to an Eat N' Park I imagine it'd be like that except classier. Well, I don't know about classier, again I've never been to Eat N' Park. But back to Max & Erma's...  The location we went to always has a crowded parking lot. I don't know why it's so busy but there's hardly any parking there. Allot a few more minutes for parking. You'll need it.  Once you're in though it's super fun. Build your burger, eat greasy appetizers, and taste some delicious milkshakes. I've had the lunch special - soup or salad or half sandwich for pretty cheap. It's just enough food to not leave you in a food coma after lunch. The only thing I wish (and yes this took away a star) is that there were more sandwich options. So sometimes I get the soup & salad and I'm still hungry. That's a no bueno.  Then there's dinner. Their burgers are kind of fantastic. I'm still not over the whole eating a rare cooked burger so everywhere in PA gets added bonus points for that. So overall it's a good burger, but it's certainly not the best burger I've ever eaten and there's nothing really creative about their burgers to make them stand apart from other place's burgers.   The atmosphere is something between a TGIFridays or Chili's but very Pittsburgh-centric. I found it somewhere between comforting and annoying. I don't really like chain restaurants but this one had some nice personal stuff to keep it from venturing into the Fridays realm.  Also, if you're a craft beer & burger sort a gal, you'll notice this place is not for you. There's more than Bud, but not a lot.   P.S. Free cookie night is Wednesday.  P.P.S. Get the white chocolate macadamia nut."}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new management and all I can say is that we had a great experience! Not sure why previous reviews were so low.  Cassey was our waitress and she was attentive, efficient and very friendly :)  Great food too- had the quesadilla and veggie burger...two thumbs up!  Also an all-you-can-eat sundae bar. Yum!  Will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I give M&E 4-stars but this one gets two because it's just...  less.  Another reviewer says it screams \"chain restaurant\" and I have to agree.  Monroeville M&E has no spirit at all.  As a regular to the Cranberry, (formerly) Downtown and Shadyside restaurants, Max & Erma's are all unique and have their own vibe.  They start off similar, but then grow organically and take on their own local flavor, which makes them cool.  This place?  It pales in comparison to the other locations.  It's the equivalent of a copy of a copy of a copy.    Whoever owns this one isn't aspiring to be anything other than \"average\" - which is unacceptable if you know anything about Max & Erma.  Truly, there's nothing specific I can point to, but there's certainly no \"love\" at this one - everything about this place is just...  \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Needed to find a place to eat for dinner while I was in town for work. They have changed their menu since the last time I was at M&E. The waitress was very friendly. The food was good."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times for lunch and have had no problems. The service is good and the food has been good. I'm satisfied with Max & Erma's and I am sure I will be back here again in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple months, and I'm so glad I came back. The food and menu quality increased greatly. I got the goat cheese burger and I was hooked. The past few times I went here the food was just okay, but this time it was out of the park. Also, my friend bought the nachos and they looked delicious. The waiter was amazing, he was such a nice guy and was great with the children at our table. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, so let me start off by saying that I used to LOVE Max & Erma's. I have been there going for almost 10 years. My absolute favorite dish was the fajitas. I had never had fajitas as good as theirs, even at a Mexican restaurant. Sadly, they removed those from the menu a couple years ago in leiu of a fajita quesadilla... NOT that same thing. When I asked why, the server had no idea since it was one of their most popular menu choices. Luckily, I took a very strong liking to the 3rd Street Salad so that became my go-to order for most of our visits.  Fast forward to last night. They have once again changed their menu and it's even worse this time. They have cut selections down so badly that all they offer now fits on one page front and back. They got rid of the shrimp (my husbands favorite meal) and and ton of other great choices. They now mostly offer burgers and sandwiches.   We started with the spinach dip as our appetizer, one of our favorites other than the pretzels.... BIG SURPRISE... they changed the recipe. It didn't look bad when it arrived but they now melt cheese on top and add cut up tomatoes to hide the fact that the dip is overloaded with spinach and super runny. It tasted SO bland! We added a bit of salt to help out but that was a big disappointment!   I ordered the 3rd Street Salad, at least they still had that on the menu, and my husband ordered the chicken with fries and asparagus. You know that salad that I absolutely loved... you guessed it... they changed up the dressing. Oh my gosh I can't even begin to describe it. It was like almost straight oil, no flavor and made my sick to my stomach. I CAN'T believe it, they took a perfectly good salad which many of us had come to love and changed the best part about it. It was awful. I didn't even finish 1/2 of it, it was far too oily (so much so the lettuce was shiny... I'm not even joking)   My husband's chicken & fries were OK, but the asparagus was a light yellowish green and hardly appetizing. If that had been it, we could have lived with it without giving it a bad review but for the fact that everything was so different this time and certainly not for the better, I have to let people know... especially those like us who used to go frequently.   They server and service was fine, this is not against them at all. She saw that we had barely touched our food and asked what's wrong and we told her. We asked if they had changed the recipes and she said she didn't know if they did for the spinach dip but they definitely did for the salad and salad dressing. What a shame!!!! In her defense, she did ask if we wanted to speak with the manager but we declined. We are not here looking for a free hand out but I can tell you that this will be the last time we go there for dinner. It just keeps getting worse. :("}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  Brautwurst andwich on a pretzel bun?  Yes please!  It's not as good as it sounds, IT'S BETTER!!!"}
{"text":"Inattentive bartender and really just poor wings and Cobb salad that I did not eat but paid full price.  Just not a good experience."}
{"text":"Burger was pathetic.  Price wasn't bad but other restaurants that compete in this space are starting to make better food.  The place has the goofy overdone decor that permeated most casual chain restaurants in the early 2000's with stupid \"vintage\" things on the walls."}
{"text":"This restaurant ended up being a god send! We ate dinner here with a party of four adults and two children, the service was outstanding and the food was excellent! Our waitress went above and beyond to make us and the children happy! She was then willing to modify my order to keep it healthy for me... Awesome, awesome restaurant"}
{"text":"It's not a bad place....it's nothing special either.   Max and Erma's has its charms but rarely is it somewhere that I ever feel compelled to go to when I want something to eat.    Almost everything that they have on their menu there is a different place nearby that does it better, to be fair there are also places that do it worse.     This is a place that exists because people apparently like the chain \"neighborhood\" restaurant theme that Applebee's and TGI Fridays popularized.....BTW...Max and Erma's better than the aforementioned."}
{"text":"I'm done going to this place.  Twice in a row and the service and food have been subpar.  Servers that do not write down my order do not impress me.  We ordered an appetizer that never came. When we asked about it our food arrived so we chose not to wait for it.   Having just ordered soup and salad that was underwhelming I left hungry.  There are too many places in Monroeville to go there again."}
{"text":"This was my second positive experience at Max and Erma's this week. I ordered the pretzel appetizer both times, and I had a different sandwich each time: the stacked club and the California grilled chicken club. Both were delicious, but the chicken club stood out.   I absolutely love avocado on anything and this club sandwich had half an avocado sliced on the top! It also included grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a drizzle of ranch dressing. All basic ingredients that combined to make a real winner in my opinion! To top it all off, the service was fast and friendly. Just what I needed at the end of a busy Saturday."}
{"text":"I sat down for a good lunch yesterday and was not disappointed. He burger was cooked right, the fries were seasoned perfectly, and the wait staff was friendly. I'll certainly go there again."}
{"text":"Visiting the boyfriends parents this weekend we were out and about doing some furniture shopping when we decided to stop at Max & Erma's for dinner. I know it is a chain but I had never been!  The place is very cute, friendly and welcoming. Not being from the area I was pointed out all the local sports teams jerseys and photos that were displayed on the walls. We had a cozy booth in the back.   We all were in the mood for burgers and they have quite the unique choices which I like! They have a burger deal where you can get soup/salad + burger + one of their famous cookies for 8.99. My boyfriend opted for this deal and got the tortilla burger which I must say, was better than my Athena burger (which was still great). His was spicy/jalepenos/tortilla strips and came with tortilla soup for dipping. SO yum.  We all got their chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Holy moly. They were fantastic. If you're ever near a Max & Erma's on the road. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"While I was passing through the Cleveland area on a solo trip, I stopped at Max & Erma's in Middleburg Heights for a late night dinner, very close to my motel off I-71. I looked over the menu which offers the traditional American and Southwestern items. See the menu at http://www.maxandermas.com   I ordered a Diet Coke and my dinner entree with a salad. My waiter asked me if I wanted to order some cookies. At first I looked puzzled, then he explained to me if I wanted fresh baked cookies after dinner, I could order them ahead of time so the cookies could bake during my dinner. I told him, \"Why not, I'll order some now.\"  The side salad with oil & vinegar was decent. For dinner, I had the Tuscan Chicken (grilled chicken, sauted artichokes, onions, tomatoes, & mushrooms over capellini in a garlic herb wine sauce) which was pretty darn good! After I was finished, I was ready for dessert and instead of coffee with dessert, I ordered a glass of milk to go with my fresh baked cookies.  The six fresh baked chocolate chip cookies were served very hot and the chocolate chips were melting as I was indulging on this sweet treat with the cold glass of milk. Overall, the meal was pretty good and the service was attentive. The fresh hot chocolate chip cookies and milk made for a great meal ending."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chains but Max and Erma's is a bit of a staple in Western PA.  With so many of them closed over the recent years it is nice to have a 'last man standing' in Monroeville.    The wait staff here are pretty attentive and friendly.  You can expect to be seated fairly quickly and not have to wait too long for your food.  I've yet to eat at Max and Erma's and not order their famous tortilla soup.  You just have to.  It's not the best soup you'll ever eat, but it is pretty tasty, and one of the best menu items they have.    I enjoyed a southern chicken salad on this most recent visit.  I have had several very tasty salads here and this one didn't disappoint.  If you really want a classic Max and Erma's experience you should order one of their tasty burgers."}
{"text":"This is our Thursday night go to place for their $5 burger and unlimited seasoned fries special.   Burgers are thick and Juicy and their Sundae Bar is great for kids!  We are never disappointed when we go here. Great value for your money."}
{"text":"I really like Max & Erma's. It's a homey restaurant to go to after a long day at work. All the food that I've had there has been descent and the service has been pleasant. Though it's a chain, it's definitely one of my Pittsburgh favorites!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to go someplace new so we ended up at Max & Erma's.  Admittedly, we weren't expecting much.  From the flyer in the paper with the coupon, it seemed like just another Red Robin or Fridays.  While the items on the menu were fairly typical, the quality blew us away.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, which was amazing.  The pork had no fat on it and was super tender.  The bun was nice and soft but not soggy.  Their fries were crisp and golden.  My wife got the tortilla burger, it was delicious as well, especially when dunked in the dipping soup it comes with.  We topped the night off with a cookie (excellent, big & soft/chewy) and chocolate cake.  The cake was massive and we brought half of it home but it was nice and moist and very rich.  Overall, we were blown away.  Couple that with the price - I'd say around $8-10 per entrée...we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Lots of items at 1000+ calories. Gotta find the right one if you are watching your weight. I would come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have enjoyed it.  Their tortilla soup is awesome!  I got the fajitas as my main order and they were delicious.  I would go back here again."}
{"text":"Max & Erma;s has a good menu with good recipes.  With some patience the food and service here is generally good.  We have been here for burgers, philly cheese (best in cleveland when made right) and the tortilla soup is amazing.  They do have management problems however the manager is among the most customer attentive ive seen in this area.  We had a problem with the philly being made by a lazy cook and returned it.  The manager made a new one himself and it was the best.  As for the ice cream, how could you want more than an open Sunday bar to have whatever and how much of what you want, give me a break, the kids love it and the ingredients are good quality.  I must agree the staff and kitchen staff obviously need training and organization to ensure food quality and timely service and a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a beer and an appetizer, so-so.  Service was nice and quick, which is about all I need with the kids.  Kids seemed to like their kids meals, the usual Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, chicken fingers.  Huge line at Mad Mex on Friday night, none here.  I doubt we will go back, too many other choices."}
{"text":"Dont normally review chain places (or places in the whitest place on Earth, Cracker Park) but its still fresh in my memory so lets do this..  Was clipping coupons in Sundays paper and saw a coupon for a free app at Max N Ermas so I thought it would be something to get us out of the house on a crappy winter day.  Actually had to check Yelp to find where one was.  20 minutes later I was in Westlake with my lil one pulling into corporate America, chain shopping heaven!  Any time we see fried pickles on a menu we get them.  These were probably some of the best Ive had!  They came with lame ranch dressing, but hey its the Midwest and thats as exotic as it gets..  Also had a double burger with NO ONIONS and it was tasty!  Kind of reminded me of a Wendys burger.  Thin, lean meat smashed on the grill and cooked to crispy perfection.  Even the damn broccoli was good.  Usually ya get that lame, freezer-burned stuff but this was tasty..maybe slighty buttered?  Since my lil one finished all her broccoli I let her have a kids sunday which is only .99 cents.  Hot damn!  Some Yuppie type off Detroit ave and, lets say w. 68th would pay 5x the dough and not have so many UNLIMITED toppings to add.  A great deal fo sho.  I was pleasantly suprised that this places food was so solid.  The only thing that was kinda off was the servers.  The one I had never noticed that my water glass was always empty and every time she came back I asked for a refill.  I was parched from mass quantities of whiskey I had the night before!  The other servers looked lost and the one dude in partucular looked like a cracked out squirrel who just escaped a fire in an adult video store...he was my fav."}
{"text":"Food was well done fries were cold server rarely came around just all around horrible service will never come back Cajun pasta was horrible bread stick was hard as a rock all food was cold"}
{"text":"Arrived about 1:30 in the afternoon. Not busy at all. Stood at hostess stand and was ignored for 5 minutes even though 4 different employees noticed me. That probably won't affect anyone's decision to come here or not but i'm still gonna take this opportunity to say \"F@&K YOU\" to this place."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and popped over for happy hour & dinner. I sat at the bar area, as they had baseball on the tv screens in that area. The service was great, I wasn't at the bar, but a table & my server was friendly and professional. The happy hour specials are good & the food was better. I had a couple of local beers on tap & a brat burger...both were very good. The few obvious local regulars that I talked to were very pleasant.... A great place to have a pint, a bite & watch a game on the TV."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've been here and let me tell you,it has improved very much so. With an updated menu and fast service,I am impressed and have changed my opinion about the place. It tends to get busy around dinner time and the seating is limited to wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had our first experience at this Max and Erma's and couldn't be happier! The food was great! My burger was cooked perfectly and my boyfriends pasta was flavorful with a small kick. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cannot go wrong with the tortilla soup! The tortilla burger is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner multiple times at this location at 5pm! Waiting for staff to show up to their job! One waitress asked us to to serve our own ice water and iced tea from the waitress station!  Location now CLOSED!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here probably 20 times.. Everything is usually good but sometimes it's delicious and sometimes it's just very average. Never had a bad meal here but tonight I had the ribs and they were fatty and cold. My wife usually gets the Cajun shrimp pasta which is always good. I've had several of the burgers and you really can't go wrong there. So with all the visits here I would give it an average of 3 stars"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. We waited forever for our waitress. She was friendly but we never saw her. Food was good."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I took a whirlwind trip to Pittsburgh to see the Steelers-Ravens playoff game. We were trying to eat at places we'd never been to before (so, no Chipote or Five Guys or Don Pablo's) and were intrigued by Max and Erma's. We had never heard of it, so we thought we'd give it a try.   Our server was really nice and service was very prompt. She always checked on us to see if we needed any refills and how our food was. The service is really what makes this a 3-star review instead of a 2-star.   The food was probably more of a 2-star. It was okay, but certainly nothing extraordinary. Bf and I decided to split two sandwiches for some variety. We chose the chicken-tomato-mozzarella and the cheesesteak. The chicken sandwich was pretty good: the chicken itself was cooked well and was moist, the mozzarella was tasty, and the tomatoes and basil were appropriately proportioned. The cheesesteak was underwhelming at best. Maybe I'm spoiled to a local cheesesteak place, but this was definitely not what I expected. It was very much a chain restaurant's attempt at a cheesesteak.   I heard they had a sundae bar, but we didn't partake. Maybe that would've made up for the underwhelming cheesesteak, but oh well.   Basically, Max & Erma's is a fast casual chain restaurant like a Friday's or Bennigan's.  The next time we make it up to Pgh, we're going to try to stick to local places. We know what to expect from Max & Erma's, and it's just kind of \"eh.\""}
{"text":"I love Max and Erma's! Always great food and extremely friendly service! It's Valentines day today and my fiance took me to Cheesecake Factory. They had a fifty minute wait! I called over here and there was no wait and we walked in and right to a table! I can't believe there's not more people here tonight! They had a great valentine's deal and we both got steaks and an appetizer and dessert."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! I remember going to this restaurant in college but the menu has definitely changed since then! That was almost 8 years ago. I wanted to go for these lasagna fries fritters I remembered.   We had just missed the happy hour specials. I was bummed because the appetizer selection looked amazing to me! $5 for nachos or loaded tots! Yum! Next time I will try and go between 2p-6p Monday - Friday. Who doesn't love a great deal?!! Am I right! I made sure to take a picture so all Yelpers could see.  My husband and I both ordered burgers. I had a bbq bacon burger with unlimited fries! YES! Unlimited fries! So if you're a potato lover like me i recommend them! And you don't have to go to Red Robins for those big unlimited fries anymore! My husband had a chipotle black bean burger with veggies as his side. He loved it! For an appetizer we shared the wings. I was sad they gave us all drumsticks so I asked the waitress about it and said normally it's 4 wings for drums. So she had the kitchen make me 4 flats and that made me happy! Great customer service!   Fun facts: They have a browns bus outside their restaurant, so if your a fan you gotta go see it and grab a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at a Max and Erma's..We were seated immediately as the restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived. Our drink orders were delivered quickly. That's when the waitress disappeared! She finally took our order which came quickly...it was delivered by the kitchen staff..still no waitress! I ordered a burger platter and slaw and my husband had a salad with \"blackened\" shrimp. The only condiments on the table were S&P so I had to wait quite a while for the waitress to reappear to request  ketchup, my missing slaw and drink refills. By then my burger was cold..my husband was well on his way to finishing his salad! Had the burger been hot..it probably would have been the best burger I've had in quite some time..the ingredients were fresh and the meat was over the top. The \"blackened\" shrimp on the salad was not blackened..it was sprinkled with blackened seasoning making it rather mundane. The frozen strawberry/ lemonade was delightfully refreshing on a hot summer day..To end the meal we were offered free cookies, it was a Wednesday promotion! I asked for oatmeal raisin and received chocolate chip..It seemed like an appropriate end to a meal that was a disaster from the beginning!  Since my husband has been to different Max and Erma's he assured me they are not all like this one and the food is generally pretty good. The Peters Twp.restaurant needs to take a long look at retraining it's wait staff..it could be a little gem in the middle of some pretty stiff competition!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! Every time we have gone there has been awesome!! The tortilla soup is delicious. The chicken fajita quesadillas are my favorite!! Service has always been great! Ice cream bar is pretty nice as well!!"}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped here for lunch since we live pretty close and have never tried it.  The server was friendly and attentive. When the food came out our fries were cold and the burgers were literally dripping with grease. I mean dripping like a faucet onto the plates. I'm getting nauseous even  thinking about it.  So gross. They were cold like the fries and dripping with grease. my gf got sick when we got home. We werent expecting anything fancy , but this was just beyond disgusting. They didnt even try. You'd be better off getting sakio japan at the mall or tbell across the street and pay 25 dollars less."}
{"text":"Fish tacos here are pretty good and I'm picky about them.  What do I like?  The fish is grilled, not fried, and not over-cooked plus there is adequate sauce to make for a moist taco.  All-in-all, I was pretty impressed, not easy when it comes to something that seems so simple in concept but execution of this dish evidently is not based on my many attempts wherever I go, Pittsburgh or elsewhere.  Other options I've ordered here are basically ok, not stellar, but ok.  It's just that there are so many options in Pittsburgh that a three-star \"OK\" place is not usually on the radar.  But, for us Monroeville residents, it's close and adequate.  Oh, and for hubby, his fav beer was 2.00 at happy hour prices, making him happy.  P.S.  This is the 2nd venue I've encountered recently that lists its menu option calorie contents on each item.  Depressing."}
{"text":"Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry I don't like to post bad or negative reviews normally. Usually  I like to say something good or I just don't say anything at all but I must say I was pretty disappointed with Max and Erma's, we had the buffalo cheese dip as an appetizer  a Caesar salad, steak and cheese sandwich and my fiancé had?  I forget the official name but it was steak with mushrooms or something, I felt like the food was average at best !!  it was maybe comparable to or even below Eat N  Park standards. The bathrooms were definitely dirty and stinky-- both bathrooms. The waitress/service  however was awesome she was very polite on point  and all-around great but I will not be visiting a Max N  Ermas again."}
{"text":"Simple mistake was made into a horrible experience by a bad manager. My $4 salad was prepared wrong. Instead of sending it back to be remade I requested that they simply take it back and remove it from my bill. There was likely less than $1 in food cost in that salad. I don't like to risk being served spit by angry line cooks so I declined a substitution or a remake. The manager came over in a huff after the waitress left and again offered me something else. Again, I declined and explained that I don't trust that there wouldn't be spit or something worse in it. She made me feel like this was a crazy assertion, saying that in 20 years of food service she has never heard of such a thing. Such bad hospitality, if you don't like dealing with unhappy patrons please find a new industry. There is no reason why the salad couldn't simply be removed without making me feel like an unreasonable bitch in the process."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for a volleyball tournament. Stopped here for dinner. The tortilla soup was incredible and the Santa Fe salad was enormous. The bartender kept the drinks coming. Felt like I was a king!"}
{"text":"Service was slow to begin with. My food was decent but nothing special. They tried to deliver my friend something she didn't order and we had to wait for it to be made correctly. It took 25 minutes to get it (after several reassurances that it would be \"right out\") and when it finally came out, her chicken was so black and burnt on the bottom that she couldn't cut through it. She didn't even eat it and we went across the street and ate at the mall."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since the late 1990's, and our recent visit was terrible.  My pineapple juice was all ice cubes, and they wanted to charge me for another one!  Also, they changed the Cajun Shrimp Pasta dish completely!  For 15 years, it had been a delicious dish that consisted of thin angel hair spaghetti with tiny shrimp made with a spicy creamy sauce.  Much to my surprise, I was served larger shrimp with a disgusting burned and charred topping (which ruined the dish) on a bed of fusilli pasta with a creamy sauce that paled in comparison to the old, classic dish they usually serve.  The salad was wilty as well, with less iceberg lettuce (which I prefer) than usual.  This place needs a serious makeover and re-vamping of management and food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this NO STARS!! Heed my warning - I should of listened/viewed Yelp before going... I waited 5 minutes for a hostess to come and take my name, on a Sunday, at 5:30 to eat. This place was not packed. Why??  While waiting, I used the ladies restroom. Let me tell you... I've seen cleaner restrooms at a truck stop. Good gosh - it was disgusting. There were two stalls and one of them was disgusting, from what the other ladies were discussing while waiting for the I was in. There was paper all over the floors - really?? Doesn't anyone come and check this? So I go back out and we get seated. The area around us is gross, carpet is very dirty and not swept, dirty dishes on empty tables, and it looked very un-kept. Our waiter came up, I'll keep his name out of this, but he looked like he just woke up and rolled out of bed and came to work. He took our drink order and left. Came back and dropped them off and left again. Like really? your menu isn't that big! We got the pick three on the menu - comes with the tortilla soup, burger and fries and a cookie. The soup came out quick (the only good thing that happened) we finally got our food - I swear it took like 30 minutes. I got my burger and it was very pink in the middle, but had the waiter asked how I wanted my burger cooked, he would of known that I wanted it done and not pink. However, there was NO WAY I was sending it back. I didn't even eat all of it. I gave half of it to my husband to eat. The fries are very salty. NEVER did our waiter come and ask if the food was ok, how we are - nothing. RUDE! Then he comes by and says \"Your cookies will be right up\" - like ok? We don't get a choice of which ones we want? I guess not, so we get the cookies - they are outstanding, as always, but not worth the trip. This whole \"adventure\" took a hour and half. Others around us that didn't have our waiter seemed to have better service, so I am wondering if it was who waited on us? Either way, I am not going back to find out.   How disappointing, because we recently moved here to Pittsburgh from Virginia where they took out our Max and Erma's - we loved it there, so we couldn't wait to go back to one - how quickly we found out not all are the same...."}
{"text":"One of the worst locations in the chain.  They never get your order right you call place an order for pick up and of course never fails check your bag before you leave the location becuase of course it was not right again. How hard is it to listen and punch in an order and we wonder why raising minimium wage is not the answer."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the time I spent here with my childhood best friend's mom.  Good food, good service, excellent company."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My fiancé and I been going to this restaurant  for around six years and they never disappoint us. I love the pick three and their cookies are the best. Great customer service."}
{"text":"My last experience with a different Max & Erma's location was terrible so I hadn't been to one in years. That location (Westlake, near Crocker Park) eventually closed down and my family and I decided to give this one a chance. We were not disappointed. We were there for lunch on a Thursday, and the place was pretty crowded. Despite this, the service was great and the staff were all very friendly. We were greeted and seated right away, and everything was timely.       As an appetizer, we shared the fried cheese skewers. It was the perfect amount for four people-four skewers with four cheese squares on each. I decided to try the BBQ burger, which was pretty standard and very good. Their menu has a lot of options, with very interesting but delicious combinations! My brother got a tortilla burger, which was topped with jalepenos, tortilla strips, and came with a cup of tortilla soup for dipping. My mom ordered a shrimp Cobb salad, which was huge and also tasty. Finally, my grandmother got a combo with half of a sandwich and a cup of soup. Portions overall were very generous, prices were great, and staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Do you want something sweet?  Order their Peach Tea.  It was like a liquid jolly rancher!  It's actually pretty good so long as you know that your tea is gonna be uber sweet.  The chicken noodle soup had my favorite kind of rectangular mooshy noodles in it.  I had the soup along with the turkey BLT.  The toast was a little soft, but there was definitely lots of turkey jammed in there.  My husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich & fries.  It was a great stop for lunch.  The most amusing part was when our waitress asked if we wanted shots.  Mmmm?  Not on a Sunday afternoon but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate with M & E's (our code word so the kiddo's don't know what we're talking about).  The kids love the gummy worms and the ice cream bar.  I love....nothing really.  I struggle each time we go to find something that works for a paleo-leaning, MSG-sensitive eater.  Sometimes the service is great, sometimes it is abysmal, and it's usually OK, but if my kids didn't love it we'd never go back."}
{"text":"Dang Max & Erma's I never thought you would have pulled off such a stellar and delicious build a burger as I got.  It was pretty fantastic.  All the toppings were just as I ordered, and they weren't ridiculously expensive.  I can't wait to go back for some more build a burger action."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Looks like they changed their menu again. I got the club. It was above average for a chain restaurant. I would recommend this place if you want to know what you are going to get."}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to like it. This was our second time trying Max & Ermas and a second time we were disappointed. We placed our order & salads came out 5 mins later which is great but our dinners didn't show up for another 40 mins.  I'd understand maybe if they were slammed but It was half empty.  When we received our food the burgers were undercooked and fries were cold.  The waitress was quick with the drinks tho we had to remind her to bring out the cookies that came with the meal. Overall this place isn't terrible but its also not good."}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail to come to this place. Big burgers was the impression that I got from the mailer and from their website that I visited to make sure this place was kid friendly.   When we arrived we had no trouble finding a parking space. Once inside we were greeted and seated immediately. The waitress was nice when she was around other than that we really didn't see too much of her.   We ordered the sampler (shareable) trio. They brought us the nachos without the chicken and potato skins. When I said something they immediately brought us out the rest of the appetizer.   The nachos are good, however i'm not too sure about lettuce on my nachos. Since I love lettuce I let it sit on the side once all the chips were gone and had like a little salad with the left over nachos, wasn't too bad.  The food is nothing like what is pictured. The husband and I ordered the Cola BBQ bacon burger. There was no drizzle of bbq sauce on my burger. It was super dry, but once I removed the bun and just ate everything else it was ok. The kids enjoyed their food. My daughter said the cheese pizza was yummy compared to other restaurant she has had it at.   I was super impressed with the build your own sundae bar. My kids had SOOOO much fun at that thing. They added that onto my kids meals for .99. Chocolate milk refills are not free they are $1 per drink, wasn't really happy about that. the $11 I spent on my burger was not worth it. The sundae bar is bar far the best thing at this place. Lots of toppings but warning they only have vanilla and the kids scoop it themselves."}
{"text":"Max & Erma's used to be a weekly lunch spot, when I worked on the other side of Monroeville.    Why?  because no place offers Tortilla Soup that can compare.  It's fabulous and the reason for 4-stars and not three.  I'm not a burger fan and yes, their salads are good.  Not award winning good, but consistently good, which definitely matters.  Monroeville's M&E upholds the corporate standard, well.  Here's another reason for going here:  Trade Wind Sangria.  They offer four sangria versions, but this one is a springy version and really hit the spot:  Sweet and white with a nice peach flavor.  Service?  This store has always managed to have a great, cheerful & competent staff.  So, as nothing can satisfy the need for their tortilla soup, Max & Erma remain on the extended food circuit."}
{"text":"I usually just go for their tortilla soup. It's something about those little fried tortilla strips that really make it special. I was in the Detroit Int. airport the first time I tried their soup and man was it awesome.   I've also had one of their salads. Can't remember which one it is at the moment but it was pretty good as well. I guess with a place like this you can't really go wrong. The service was prompt and our waitress stopped back frequently to check on us. Why can't all waiters and waitresses be like that?   Any how I would recommend you stop on in and try their soup at the least. Sometimes the local newspaper has coupons for lunch and dinner if your on  a budget."}
{"text":"Went there once while in Pitt on vacation.  Once was enough.  Basic chain fried food and burgeres.  We didn't know that as we had never heard of it but just like a applebee's or TGIF.  Was hoping for something different.  Now I know.  The staff was good though."}
{"text":"We decided to attend an invitation for a birthday party at Max And Ermas in Gibsonia, even though I have several bad experiences with this place. We thought maybe things had changed. Far from it. Severely watered down drinks, hamburgers not cooked at the requested temperature ( asked for med rare and was served med well),  taste of the food is incredibly poor. Service was just ok. When I was asked if I would like another drink I told the waitress that it tasted like water and cranberry juice (I ordered a vodka cranberry). I replied no and asked for a water. When I took one bite of the burger it was way over cooked and tasted awful. She asked me would I like another to which I relied no thank you. (I simply cannot trust the cooks to cook a decent burger). She gave me a dirty look, never apologized, and walked away. I won't go back even if it is by invitation. One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how much I really enjoyed this place! I'm part of a Meetup group which gets together once a week just to get out of the house and have fun with dinner or a movie or both. But the staff was so welcoming and accommodating to our \"large\" group (13 people). Our server was such a sweetheart, warm and friendly. The food was absolutely wonderful and trust me when I say this, get some chocolate chip cookies! Those little morsels were some of the best cookies I ever had: not too hard or too soft, freshly baked :)  If you have a group of friends you and need to find a place to hang out or a good location for a date with that special someone, definitely recommend Max and Erma's!  P.S. The Garbage Burger is to die for! I never knew marinara sauce went well with a burger but it totally did! No ketchup or mustard needed. So, would recommend getting that if you ever find yourself at a Max and Erma's."}
{"text":"This place is always hit or miss with me. Either everything is great or I leave unimpressed. Nonetheless, I would still pick Max and Erma's instead of the over popularized chains like Applebee's or TGI Fridays anytime. I usually go with a burger or appetizer and I much prefer the bar area to the actual restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I should have known better.. How are these places still in business.  After being ignored by the two hostess for 5 minutes, once seated, the fries were the hardest French fried sticks I've ever had.  Their Cajun burger was a patty with onion and smothered with something they consider Cajun.  Should have gone to the 5 guys across the street."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Both had the $8.99 Soup, burger and cookie special. The tortilla soup was SUPER! Burgers were hot and yummy however messed up one of the orders slightly.  We got the sundae bar as well to split one and it was fully stocked with serve yourself scooped ice cream and a mixed bag of condiments.  Cookies were fresh and chocolate melted in your mouth.   Only complaints are that one burger didn't come out as ordered with requested toppings. Also our server spent more time chatting with friends and paying attention to a business meeting eating in rather than us and we were seated first. Didn't bring my Arnold Palmer to the table until after I reminded her, even though the other table was served three times.   Even thought one server disappointed the manager and the hostess came by multiple times to check with us.   Highly recommended food and we will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Went here with Mom after shopping and had to ask to get drinks filled, to get our bill, and to get our burgers. I have had better speed and service in restaurants filled to capacity. Our server took way too long to get food to us and to get our water. The food was what I expected for a chain, but service was definitely keeping them closer to 2 stars than they are to 4."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in quite some time & thought I would give it a try again. To be honest, it was super bland. From the cheese skewers that should have been garlicky & were not to my cheeseburger, it all seemed lacking in flavours. The burger was cooked to perfection tho. My meal was replaced with the buffalo chicken sandwich- nice flavor & not too hot. I was willing to pay for what we ate but the manager comped our entire meal. We tipped our server, of course & feel like next time we will try something different but we will give them another try. Great staff & nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Basic fast food under a great name.  Off 19n/s  Cranberry.  Suits the venue well.  Good service.  Well managed fast food.  But atmosphere is excellent for small groups.  Decent bar."}
{"text":"I have been going to Max and Erma's most of my life. I figured the place out on my first trip. You get a basket of fries and a big beer and you order the giant garbage burger. It is an amazing experience. Skip all the tortilla strip soup, tex-mex enchilada beef tip guacamole eat-the-bowl salad stuff (okay I made that one up) and go with what made the place.  Their fries are excellent and are made to go with beer. Get the basket of fries. The garbage burger is amazing and cannot be replicated at home or anywhere else.  If you order this giant burger, fries and a beer you'll be happy. If you order anything else I don't know. The g-burger is so good I have never considered anything else. Don't listen to those garbage-shouldn't-be-in-the-name-of-food types. It's great. Memorable great."}
{"text":"Fantastic as usual. Great tortilla soup, great Santa Fe salad, fantastic service. The only negative I have is that he tables in the middle have poor lighting. They should have a light overhead just like the tables aligned against the wall."}
{"text":"I'd only been to a M&E restaurant 9 years ago in Downtown Pittsburgh. I remember making a mess of myself trying to eat their burger.  This time I used silverware.   What I did was modify their Honkytonk Burger, which aleady came with pulled pork, BBQ mayo, deep fried pickles, and bacon between two pieces of Texas toast. I added a spicy mayo, guacamole, and caramelized onions among some other things to make it a little more heinous, so much so that eating it by hand was futile; a knife and fork were required to dispatch the beast for good. Nonetheless, it made for a pretty mighty (if not legendary) medium rare burger, one that dripped like a leaky faucet when I first bit into it.  I had a taste of Kay's Laredo Steak and was transported to Ruth's Chris for half a minute. Seared to an on-target medium rare and seasoned well, the square of beef wilted in my mouth with little chewing needed.   Whether or not they are pre-fabricated, their sextet of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies are a fun, rudimentary way to finish the meal. Just like their damn fine seasoned french fries, the cookies have an outer crisp and a thermal, soft interior made bloody rich by the melted choco-bits. And they come to you on an aluminum pan with a spatula.   Marilyn, our server was a delight and handled her duties well.   I'm not regretting our post-wedding visit with Max and Erma late yesterday morning. They're a cute couple to hang out with even if they have many counterparts all over the U.S. of A."}
{"text":"Oh why do people trash Max and Erma's? 'Cause it's a chain, and that's the cool thing for foodies to do? *sigh*  Order a Garbage Burger like I did this past Sunday afternoon and stifle yerselves. Geez. The meat is butcher-fresh, the bun is bakery-new, and it is stuffed to capacity with hickory-smoked bacon, cheddar, Swiss, American, mozzarella, caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, guacamole & marinara sauce. It is a mishmash. It is a monstrosity. It is manly. Eat one or go hide and weep in your expensive loft.   Honestly, M&E's does a mid-rare burger quite well, better than many independent restaurants I might add.  I'm pointin' yer way...August. Henry's...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHUOM1aK_jc  And of course, who can't order some of those patently fantastic chocolate chip cookies? Does M&E have any other dessert worth ordering? Their barrel-shaped, Tootsie Roll-ish, choco-chunks puncuate the balmy, ductile baked dough and take you to a simpler time. Unable to resist digging in hastily, each one became...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5W8DepgUy4&feature=related  And serving them on a baking pan just forces me to crack a smile. Did your mother  do that for you as a kid on a rainy day? Mine did.   The BBQ Chicken Quesadilla is a fine way to start the meal as well, its avocado ranch dressing being the highlight, the quesadilla itself merely serving as a vessel for the sweetness and tenderness within.   We found nothing shabby about the joint, and the service was friendly and on-point.   Come on with it. I ain't afraid of yinz."}
{"text":"Great bar if you are going there to drink   The food is terrible. I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare and it came back well done. I asked for lettuce and onion on it when I got my over cooked burger it didn't have cheese on it so they took it back slapped a piece of cheese on it microwaved it and brought it back. It was rubbery and dry and not good.   Serious waste of money"}
{"text":"This place is your typical chain. The food was kinda blah and boring. It's alright in a jam, but I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"David the bartender was amazing! I had quite a few questions about the menu and he had the patience of a man raising 50 screaming toddlers. The tortilla soup was amazing and the mule was delicious! He recommended the homemade dressing and it was soo good. We never waited on refills and he had a wonderful personality. I will definitely be back and would recommend my friends!"}
{"text":"It had been forever since either of us had dined here, so we broke the dry spell. They have a fairly limited menu focused on hamburgers, a few salads a few chicken dishes and maybe a pasta or two, but their signature dish is hamburgers. Rather than fight the current we ordered hamburgers. The lady got their Ragin' Cajun burger, and I their garbage burger. The Cajun burger got accolades from the lady, and despite having ordered their \"max\" sized burger her plate was burger-free by the time the check came. She got fries, steak house style ones that looked to be house cut. My garbage burger had things that seemed totally incongruous slapped on top, including guacamole, marinara three cheeses, bacon, onions, pickles and several other things that escape recollection, I'm sure. Despite the odd assortment of condiments, they actually came together nicely, were I to return I would order it again. I got house made onion rings and we both got iced tea. Then the bill came. This is the part the I have difficulty reconciling, and is likely the reason it has been years since we last dined here. Two burgers, fried sides, of which the frieds were included with the burger, and the rings were maybe a $1.50 uptick, two non-alcoholic drinks, and the bill is $35 PLUS tip. What? That makes it over $20 each for a freakin' hamburger luncheon. Am I the only guy around that thinks that's a bit extreme? No, it wasn't Kobe beef, it wasn't billed as being prime, so what's with the twenty dollar burgers? The food was great, but I'm going to have to REALLY be Jonesing for a burger before I pony up that much anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. No one at the lobby to greet us. Went to restroom while we waited.. The men's bedroom was filthy. The toilet seat had feces on it. The place was never cleaned. Turned around walked out and left restaraunt . The dirtiest place we ever were at and nonexistent staff.  Pathetic !"}
{"text":"Great place. Love the variety in the menu. Fresh bake cookies is such a great dessert!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the tortilla burger. Everything else is okay, but the tortilla burger is the star of the menu.   The only problem when the wife and I visit and she gets a tortilla burger is that it is invariably not well-done. Often still pink. We came up with the idea to have the entire burger brought to the table piecemeal and build it once it's confirmed that the burger is well done enough.   That aside, Kaya is an amazing waitress there and she always takes great care of us."}
{"text":"Not cheap. Slow service even though not a busy time and a lot of staff running around. Greasy. Floppy fries with a sawdust texture inside. If you like greasy and fried you may have found a new home. Instant mashes potatoes. Avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Max & Erma's for family friendly casual dining. Our on most recent visit with baby in tow, the staff were super nice, and gave us a bunch of individual saltine packets to keep our little one entertained. My husband had the burger, we I assumed he enjoyed because he basically went to town on it. :) I tried their new ham & pesto ciabatta and yes to the tomato-pesto mayo I want it on all of my sandwiches from now on!  And while we didn't have it this time, both my husband and I are big fans of the tortilla soup."}
{"text":"Solid experience. I had the cobb salad - veggies and lettuce were fresh and the grilled chicken was delicious. We also tried some appetizers  - potato skins (my favorite) and pretzel sticks with queso - both were very good - large portions - had a lot leftover. I think this restaurant has held up over the years, hadn't been here in awhile, glad we stopped by, definitely recommend for lunch or dinner. Location is convenient. Good value."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. everything was burnt. From the photo skins too the frys. Yes and I have a fish allergy and i asked and i would get a soup instead and they came back and gave me frys and then just walked away. And then i was sitting here not eating and she comes back and ask what is wrong Ummmm the frys that I can't eat and she goes on im sorry we are out of chicken noodle. And then says she can give me clan chowder yes, because I can eat that. And then chaged ua for the soup that i didnt even eat. Alright. ugh just horibal. Never going back. Ever."}
{"text":"The service was great (thanks, Angie!) and the food was incredible (I had the grilled asparagus for an appetizer - amazing! - and the Hula Salad - which was quite awesome!). However we had to ask to be moved because the smell of the soiled carpet was so bad where we fist sat. It smelled like that old greasy restaurant mop bucket. Yuck!  If they can clean, replace, or better yet get rid of the carpet they'll improve my rating a lot. The urinals in the men's room need cleaning and attention, also!"}
{"text":"I could never live without their chicken tortilla soup! I literally dream about it! We always ask for Maura when we go in, she does a great job.   They have daily drink specials and a happy hour. This is a good place for a bird to eat or to grab a few drinks.  There is typically a wait during peak times, but it is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Max & Erma`s tortilla Burger combo should be the 8th wonder of the world. An amazing Burger with fries, tortilla soup and a fresh baked cookie to boot! Skip on the overpriced burger from across the road and really treat yourself for about half the cost. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The new fish tacos are delicious!! I love fish tacos and these were fantastic. Kayla our waitress was excellent! She was so good to us. We couldn't have had better service. Definitely worth stopping by. Very clean , great food and courteous staff."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good.  I had the fish tacos(minus the cilantro). They were delicious!  I have eaten them at 3 other restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, and these were by far the best.  My husband ordered the sirloin steak, and he raved about the quality.  Much better than steaks at the chain restaurants. We found this to be a very good value."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at Max & Erma's, and you know it wasn't too bad. I'll be honest with you on this review, nothing was \"absolutely horrible\", there wasn't \"terrible service\", and it wasn't overall \"disgusting\". My visit here was like any other average family's' visit. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either.  The Food: The food was quite good. I was surprised it actually came out kind of looking like the picture shown. Also, it tasted good.  The Service: The service was overall nice. All of the servers had decent personalities, and knew how to crack jokes. It wasn't bad, at all. They were quick, Efficient, and friendly. At Least this crew was.  The Inside: Beside the relatively dirty restroom, flies flying around in the dining area, and cold \"hot\" fudge, it was just alright. The bar seemed lonely and under stocked, the pictures reminded me of a cheesy interior of Applebee's, and the seats were not comfortable. Not good inside.  I gave this 3 stars solely on the decent service, and food. This place has potential on being great, but it needs work. Like I said I want to give you an honest review based of an average family going to an average place. I hope this catches your eye and you decide on where to eat next!"}
{"text":"Ordered ribs, which came to the table cold. Refrigerator cold. Sent 'em back for more fire, came back at room temperature. Gave up on that meal. No apology from the manager, who was politely informed of the issue.   I did get in touch with HQ and they offered free food which I declined. Just wanted them to know how awful that meal was and how far they'd fallen.  Used to eat at Max & Erma's frequently after moving to PIT in 2006. Then the chain was bought, went bankrupt and changed hands again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have lunch date with my daughter. We sat in the bar area and the waitress was pretty busy but her service was excellent! The food was hot when we received it and was very tasty. We had a nice lunch and a enjoyed each other's visit!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent late evening meal, great waitress and even a hot cookie for desert.  Will definitely return.  Can't beat the price either!"}
{"text":"Great burgers at a reasonable price. We'll definitely be back, especially for the cookies!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was great. I had left my credit card there and they had held onto it for the day. Will go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"For a chain, and for a restaurant in Mentor period, my sister and I have always had a great experience when we have visited this location. Service has always been wonderful as has the food. No complaints."}
{"text":"Chicken Tortilla soup is quite tasty... Also, flavorful burgs with a large selection..."}
{"text":"We used visit almost every Wednesday- free cookie Wednesday! We loved the menu, the food was consistently great, and the service was good. We had two bad visits with exceptionally slow service despite it not being busy and our orders being wrong. We took a break and came back. The menu had changed, but the yummy burgers were still there. Nonetheless, we had 3 bad visits again. The final straw was when the waitress put my boxed leftovers on the floor. I am still in disbelief. Fortunately, we have family in Cranberry and can get our Max & Erma fix there with good service."}
{"text":"I'm looking for the waitress and she's sitting at the bar watching the game.    I got my appetizer, but no plate, silverware, etc. Do I really have to ask?   Sorry, but I have money to spend, and all I want is to have a good experience when I go out to watch a game. There are less than 10 people here, and the service is still sub-standard. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were great.  I love their pretzel sticks.  Service was good as well.  It's a 4 star chain 3 star restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for over 3 years but I still crave Max & Erma's Tortilla Soup so on my recent trip home I had to have it, and it was just as good, if not better, than I remembered.  Their tortilla soup is different than most - more on the creamy, cheesy side, and definitely has a kick to it. Unbelievable.   All I got was their soup so this review is based purely on it. But I remember their food always being decent, esp their homemade choc, chip cookies."}
{"text":"I've been to Max & Erma's countless times, and I was there again last week for lunch with my cousin. Service was kind of slow this time around, but the food was good like always. I had the buffalo chicken burger (my favorite). Cousin had a burger and the tortilla soup. She was practicaly licking the bowl. We didn't imbibe, as Cousin is pregnant (and it was a little early, even for me), but I like their pitchers of red sangria. I'm also a fan of the steak salad, the burgers, the potato skins, and the pretzels.  Ugh, now I'm hungry.  Prices are good, similar to Applebee's, Friday's, etc. There is outdoor seating, but sadly, it's getting chilly. So we sat inside.  Oh, and they serve milk and cookies. I probably should have led with that."}
{"text":"We used to love Max N Erma's. We loved to go on Wednesdays for Free Cookie Wednesday, but, they ended that sometime around April 2016. That was disappointing, but we still visited and got cookies to go! The last few times we went we got the same waitress who was VERY slow. Food came out wrong a few times, (nothing major, bacon on a burger when I didn't ask for bacon) so we hadn't visited in awhile. Today we visited for dinner. It was somewhat busy for a Saturday afternoon and we had a great waitress! The menu was different than the last time we visited.  It went from a spiral bound book to a single piece of menu paper front and back. They took away the \"make your own burger\", but when I asked for it, the waitress said I could get that still. So, I got my usual' a cheeseburger with a fried egg on it. The waitress returns after a few minutes and tells me the cook said they do not have eggs so I cannot get a fried egg. A little strange, but ok, I guess.  Also they now have changed their burger to 1/2 pound burgers as opposed to the two sizes they used to have (the erma and Max). Not a complaint since I don't mind more food, but something worth pointing out. Not happy with the menu changes. I sure missed my fried egg burger!! How does a restaurant not have eggs?  Update 8/1/17: went back because we had a gift card and coupons. Fried egg burgers are back! Had great service and good food!"}
{"text":"We ate here last week, and were very impressed.  I had a black bean veggie burger and their spicy tortilla soup with some peach tea, and it was excellent.  My boyfriend ordered the herb halibut w/rice though, and it was also heavenly.  Our waiter was friendly, and the atmosphere was casual with unique decor (think soapbox derby cars & old carnival signs to name a few examples).    Another really cool thing about this place is that you can order cookies for after your meal, and they'll bake them fresh for you while you're finishing up your food.  You can take them to go or eat them there, and even order a glass of milk to with 'em.  Very nice touch, and very very good food.   We don't live in OH, but I would definitely be a repeat customer if we did."}
{"text":"Great food and deserts. Service was also awesome. Tough to find good restaurants in the Berea area, so glad we found this place. Cookies are also tasty."}
{"text":"During our one night stay at the Monroeville Choice Inn, my partner and I looked for a restaurant that was close enough to walk.  We could see a sign for Max and Erma's across the street that looked easy to reach.  It wasn't.  With perseverance, we finally made it to the restaurant.  It is obviously a very popular spot for the surrounding motels and locals.  Business was brusque.  We waited about five minutes for a two-person table and five minutes later our server greeted us and took drink orders. The restaurant specializes in cheeseburgers and there were beautiful choices on page after page of the menu.  Being a little more health conscience, we went to the back page and ordered entrees from a special section of meals under 550 calories.  My partner ordered a sirloin and I selected Tuscan Chicken.  The sides were broccoli and asparagus.  Food arrived within 15 minutes.  The chicken was excellent, the vegetables were as good as any green steamed vegetable can be.  The steak had a nice flavor but was a little tough.  It was the first time in recent memory that a server at any restaurant did not ask my partner to cut into it to see if it was cooked to his satisfaction.  She did not check back at any point but did bring additional glasses of drink.  There was no offer for dessert but the first smile from the server came when the bill with a space for the tip was brought to the table. This particular outlet of the chain needs a major overhaul with fresh pain, new carpets, and renovated tables and booths.  Everything was OK, but I don't believe I would choose it if there were other options.  On a scale of five, Monroeville Max and Erma's receives: 1/2 star out of 1 for atmosphere 1 star out of 2 for service 1 1/2 star out of 2 for food 3 stars total"}
{"text":"Second time I'm here in as many days.  Nice place! Sat at the bar twice. Really good pub grub! Very nice people working and everything is very clean. Also a nice place to sit have a beer and watch a game. I may be back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice neighborhood spot for delicious burgers and an average overall menu. Very good for kids and the fresh cookies are some of the best around. They also have great deals depending on days of the week. Definitely a regular stop on our families dinners."}
{"text":"My family and I dined here and we all enjoyed our meals. The waitress was very kind and attentive to our needs. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Eh. As an extended family, we've met up w the kids, parents, grandparents, & such twice this month  in the mid afternoon after shopping. It's extremely family friendly.  Both times MY waitress was EXCEPTIONAL.   Both times management was abrasive and awkward; as was other staff.   During our first visit, upon being seated we asked the manager if we could change our seating due to where our high chair would be located. The manager loudly sighed and rolled their eyes! I was shocked. I know rotations are a pain but the place was empty so there was no need for the high chair to be where it was.   As our food arrived, only our waitress worked alone to bring it out. (Weird when so many people were doing nothing) Several waitstaff, a bartender, and the hostess were hanging out at the hostess stand chatting. I forgot to ask for a plastic spoon for my toddler. I approached the half dozen staff who were gossiping and asked for a set of plasticwear.  I was told that I would have to wait for my waitress to return and to ask her to get it. The hostess, bartender, and other waitstaff (on the clock) continued to chat as I returned to my seat. Who does that?   Now as for our food. It was really good. We tried a bunch apps. Something to munch on but not dinner. Ordered the meatballs, nachos, quesadillas, buffalo tenders, black bean roll ups. Everybody ordered an appetizer. When food arrived, we realized that we ordered way too much. The food was nice in size. Kids loved it. Everyone was very satisfied w the food orders. We boxed up a lot to go home. The dogs were quite pleased with dinner later in the evening.   Chicken Fajita Quesadilla- 5 pieces of chicken quesadilla w peppers and onion, served w guacamole & Pico  (yum)  Kids Burger- 2 mini cheeseburger- kids loved them. Quality beef. Gobbled down quickly  Cheese App- 4 skewers w 4 cheese cheese cubes on each. Serves w ranch and marinara. Like sophisticated mozzarella stickers.    Meatball- a gigantic meatball. Didn't try it but was a hit amongst the family.    Nachos- really big. Good. Kind of expensive. Would order again for happy hour price but not full price. Could use more cheese.   Black bean roll ups- really likes these.  Ordered steamed. MrToddler loved them when dipped in ranch dressing.     Because of the food & our server. We decided to try again. Bad idea.   Yesterday, we sat next to a dirty table throughout our entire meal. For over an hour.   Meanwhile, I could see the manager and other waitstaff chatting and resting at a wait stand in the next section and doorway to the kitchen.   My waitress and others in my section were clearly over their heads trying to run food, drinks, fill ice, and take orders; while other sections had standing around doing not a thing, leaning on stands and talking. Bizarre dynamic.   Looking at a dirty table for over an hour isn't enjoyable but watching staff not give each other a hand is irritating.   As for managers. Could they be any more awkward? I doubt it.  I give credit to the servers working there who are providing excellent service and going above and beyond.  It's pretty obvious that they're doing it on their own.  While I could write further in depth about the food at Max and Erma's, I feel it's a waste of time due to the low quality of management leadership & morale ruining the dining experience."}
