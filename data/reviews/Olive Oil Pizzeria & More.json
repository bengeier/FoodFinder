{"text":"Tried the Washington location for the first time. Bought wings and calzones on the order. Cheese and fillings were good but the entire order was cold and under cooked. Had to put it in oven for a while and the dough was still raw. (We live a block and a half from the location so it shouldn't have been cold). 

Wings were over cooked and dried out and sauce was mediocre at best. 

Will give the pizza a chance on another order. Hopefully it will be cooked as their cheese and sauce seem top notch.  

When I called about it they didn't seem particularly interested"}
{"text":"This is probably my 2nd favorite pizza in Canonsburg, plus we really like their flying pig sandwich. No problems with their service as of yet, they are generally friendly on the phone and when we pick up the pizza and delivery time is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The pizza reminds me of pizza you'd find at the beach.  You need to get past the assholes writing on here because they have one less chicken wing and eat here!!"}
{"text":"Pretty hard to screw a pizza up but these guys make it look easy. I would rather eat a frozen pizza than eat here again. It took over a hour to have the food delivered."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having some really good authentic Italian food and they delivered, a bonus for most of us travel weary folken. But I was disappointed,highly disappointed. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo it was runny with way to much garlic, the garlic bread had to much butter so much the bread was soggy. I've had Alfredo from Pizza Hut that was better and that's not saying much.The NY cheesecake tasted like olive oil. My husband's hoagie was good but not fantastic. Normally I would not write a bad review, but there comes a point when you get tired of wasting money. Maybe it's better when you dine in."}
{"text":"When I moved here a year and a half ago, one of the first things I wanted to look for was a good pizza place. Olive Oils is amazing. The carry out specials is worth the drive, the delivery is usually faster than they say and is always delicious."}
{"text":"It was good pizza it just was very doughy and not all the way cooked. They were very busy so I'm assuming that's why. I would try them again because the people that worked there were extremely kind and the pizza had good flavor. After I try again I'll update."}
{"text":"This place had some awful reviews here on Yelp, so I knew I'd have to go and add a rebuttal. We've been ordering pizza for take out here for the last several Thursdays. It's cheap ($10 for an extra-large one topping pizza) and it's actually very good for the price you pay. You could be spending $30 on a pizza, and not get great quality. This place is unpretentious and acceptable bordering on good quality. I'd definitely recommend this place for a takeout deal."}
{"text":"Ordered couple pies from this place. Just typical conveyor belt garbage pizza. I have no idea where this place learned how to make a pizza. Oh my fault they didn't. Save you your money don't order here!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ate at this restaurant I am in Washington pa for work was tired of the same old thing. I had lasagna an hot wings they were both very good an would recommend to eat at this place. I spend the night up here a couple times a month will be ordering again. The only thing is they are busy takes some time to get your food but worth the wait"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Pizzas. Real sausage on the pizza, not the little frozen spheres that look like rabbit turds, is a big plus. Delivery, the few times that I have chosen it, is spotty at best. I'd rather just go pick it up, as I do with mostly all food that I order...saves money, saves hassle,saves time. I have also had 4 or 5 different hoagies, and all were good. Haven't tried any wings or sides, and probably won't , since all are oven baked. After quite a few years in the pizza business in my younger days, I know that technique just doesn't measure up to deep fried. Good coupons and pick up specials as well...got 1/2 Steak Hoagie and 4 cut with Pepperoni and Sausage for $9.50 last night"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was excellent from this place!! We had the Hawaiian (my fav) and Olive Oil's special. They were both piled will lots of delicious toppings. They arrived hot and quick. One tip, find a coupon cause it wasn't cheap!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness the pizza and hoagies are phenominal because the bad service costs them a lot of business. I've ordered from them whenever I  want pizza or have company for sporting events ever since they first opened. My guests always rave about the pizza and hoagies, but after a while I will order from somewhere else because of the headaches with service. I eventually crave the food (just the pizza and hoagies, not anything else)....so I go back...only to be disappointed by the service again. 

 The service has always been an issue. The recent \"new management\" hasn't helped any. So if you want good pizza--just be prepared to get annoyed...from pick up or delivery--the entire process can be frustrating...I've personally experienced: being  put on hold for forever (and/or have to call back three times to put in an order)...to tyring to pick up and not being greated for ten minutes while I stood there looking at my food on top of the oven being kept warm (this has happened all three times I've tried to pick up).... Every time I've been in therel the employees are stepping over each other, cursing, yelling, trying to triage messed up orders. The poor person at the phones is trying to take orders, get deliveries ready to go and run register...they are just.... way understaffed.  If you opt for delivery, it generally takes longer than an hour, will be expensive. I've had food show up cold, obvious it had been on it's side...and the driver gets lost about 50% of the time and has to call to find me...he's usually one town over with a street of the same name even though I stress each time that I'm NOT in that town,I'm in the smaller town.... 

I like the food enough to give them three stars...any place else probably would have gotten one star with service this bad."}
{"text":"As I'm typing this, the place is fairly new. They took over the Dominos location but I'd say for the better. I'm really impressed with their pizza. I have yet to try anything else they offer. I would really recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. One hour and fifteen minutes to deliver and we live 10 minutes away. The sauce may have well been ragu, the cheese sticks were clearly frozen and cold upon arrival, the sauce spilled all over them, and they forgot our ranch dressing. Definitely needs to work on their customer service for not delivering clean, hot and correct food. The driver didn't even offer to fix it. Not recommended."}
{"text":"The pizza is great and the price is as well!! The people there are very friendly and accommodating! The Italian hoagie is the best!!!
Actually, all of their hoagies and pizzz are great!!"}
{"text":"Got a Flying Pig. Might feed 4 children might....not adults. Poor execution of cooking skills most of what one would figure to be saut√© Peppers Mushrooms Onions were raw in huge chunks the meats excluding Chicken Steak and Ground beef looked like they just slapped them on this undersized so-called Monster of a sandwich sadly it was a mess and that's an understatement. And I felt 15$ for an average sized Hoagie was a poor choice of my cash...as for now Sorry Mr. Olive Oil your on my Black List for now."}
{"text":"Order steak and cheese sub and cheese fries was told to take an hour got them an hour later, cheese fries were cold and soggy and the steak and cheese sub red was soggy. The bread was good but the steak was hardly there it was more romaine lettuce and tomato better off with subway $16 order definitely not worth it"}
{"text":"Fuckin gross, man. Wings were soft and fell apart as I picked them up out of the watery sauce that spilled all over the container; making their individual packed bag a water balloon of orange liquid. Ordered 20, ate 5 in an effort not to waste, threw 15 away right in the damn garbage. It felt like I was eating slop. Sauce was rubbish too. Cheese fries could replace missing manhole covers. Shit was a solid disk of over-cooked, over baked bullshit. Delivery driver was nice enough, and tried to explain away the fucked up hot wing water balloon with some gibberish even though it could only be shitty driving on what I can only imagine was a trip here on Rainbow Road. He ended his excuse making with \"they're all in there,\" gee, thanks, Mario. Maybe next time layoff the Star Power and just keep it under 40mph for that 3.2mile drive? \"Olive Oil's\" must be a disclaimer for 'all of the oils will be all over your shit,' I guess. Crazy how this place is across the street from a grocery store I frequent, and take home a lot more food and never spill any of that shit while making that same drive--and I keep that shit in the trunk! Unforgivable."}
{"text":"I ordered the 20 inch pepperoni pizza.  It was very good pizza.  Also a great value for 14 and some change for carry out.  Now I also ordered 20 wings.  10 were BBQ 10 were garlic.  I would not reccommend the wings.  They are very blane tasting.  But for pizza two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We ordered from here because we found out they deliver to our house (yay!)

We ordered a medium cheese pizza, a small double bacon cheeseburger pizza and half of a meatball hoagie & (2) 2 liters of pop.

The cheese pizza was average. I like Fiori's sauce better but other than that it was good.

My husband LOVED the cheeseburger pizza. He said it was the best he had ever had. Lots of fresh toppings, good flavor.

Meatball was REALLY disappointing. Not house made meatballs at all. I've had better frozen ones from giant eagle. Cheese wasn't melted on. Bread was soggy. It was just gross.

Delivery was fast. Price was good ($35) for the portions. We will probably order from again and just avoid hoagies."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza, wings and salad.  The wings had no flavor and it all tasted the same.  We had hot, mild and bbq.  We also ordered the extreme cheese pizza and added sausage and pepperoni to it.  The pizza was good, but they forgot the sausage and pepperoni."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Washington and have tried several local pizza restaurants. Our first purchases were the Outrageous Cheese and the Monster meat. Our pizzas arrived sooner than expected and were just out of the oven hot. We both agreed they were the best pizzas we have ever eaten. The blend of cheeses on the cheese pizza were mouth watering in that I couldn't wait for the next bite. The cheese tasted fresh and creamy. The meat pizza was loaded with tasty morsels and was different from any meat pizza I have ever eaten. This is real Italian pizza."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that this place has a two star review this is one of my favorite \"when I'm in the area\" pizza places. I live in wash pa so I allwase order in house , and am never dissapointed. The last time I was in I got the Bianca, sundried tomato pizzas and a spinach hoagie spent under 50 bucks fed my family and they all were happy and impressed, they were also shocked that I never shared this place with them before. 

Keep up the great work guys I'm a huge fan love the place and the location and the style of food"}
{"text":"Olive Oil had been our favorite pick-up pizza since moving here to Canonsburg two years ago. In the last few months the quality of the pizza has changed. The crust is thicker and doughy to chew. The sausage has gone from pieces to ground sausage. We may have to separate from Olive Oil."}
{"text":"We live in Washington pa also.  Olive oil's is the best pizza here!!  We highly recommend it to anyone looking for great pizza!!"}
{"text":"Muffaletta hoagie was very tasty. I'd skip the provolone sticks which are boring at best. They delivered to our hotel fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I am shaking my head in wonder at the Tribune-Review  insert I got in the mail yesterday. A special reader's choice \"best of \"section claimed  \"The best pizza in Canonsburg: Olive Oil's!\" Beg pardon? Is this the same place we tried ordering from three times in the same night (twice successfully, once they forgot about us) ? The first time we tried the employee taking orders had to call back twice to see if they had it right as she had didn't understand the coupon we were using ( we opted to go pick it up as we weren't sure they'd ever find the place and they still did not have it right, and it was half burnt). When we walked in, the food was still not ready, and the only activity I could see in the kitchen was Beavis and Butthead studiously watching a stromboli slowly exiting a small pizza oven.  The second time a very mediocre tasting pizza was delivered, and obviously carried sideways because all the cheese and toppings were not only on one side of the pie but half way up the side of the box as well.
We Canonsburgians are always itching for a good new place for pizza, and we do have a few wonderful and underappreciated parlors. I am completely befuddled as to how this place got to be the #1 in town. I think  the readers of the trib perhaps need to read something else if they feel that Olive Oil's serves the best.  Thank you for reading."}
