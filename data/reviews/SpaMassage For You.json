{"text":"**LivingSocial coupon users beware**  Doesn't even deserve a star.  A very deceptive desk lady and a disappointing experience. Was given a two massage \"gift\" for my wife and I through Living Social. Called to make an appointment and the desk lady gave us the \"you can't use it for two people. Didn't you read the fine print?\" runaround. I contacted the person who gave us the coupon and they decided to give us another so we could both go, so I called back to schedule an appointment. They couldn't do it on a few days that we could because they were \"remodeling.\" I explained that my wife and I live overseas and only had a week and a half to get both massages. The desk lady promised me she would get us in twice before we leave, but refused to schedule the second ahead of time. She said they can't do that until the first appointment, but again PROMISED she would get us in both times before we leave... more on that later.  We arrived to the place in shambles and obviously in the middle of being remodeled (why were they even open?). Holes in the drywall being patched and scraped down, paint cans laying around, the whole nine yards. The lady at the desk had her back turned to us and barely looked up to greet us when we walked in. We filled out the paperwork and noticed right away that one if not two of the workers were obviously under the influence. Not a great first impression.  Both ladies who gave us the massage were friendly and the massage itself was good. Though it was a bit uncomfortable in the tiny room with the smell of alcohol and the cramped quarters. The room smelled like strong alcohol every time one of the ladies breathed. Not an ideal environment for a massage. I had asked when I made the reservation for my wife and I to be in the same room for the massage, so they stuffed us in a room the size of a walk in closet. The ladies could barely move around the tables and kept knocking things over throughout the 90 mins. Again, I want to stress, the massage was great, I just couldn't be more unimpressed with the overall experience. We got dressed and walked out to schedule the second time and SURPRISE... they were all booked up. I threw out all the dates and times that we could before we left the country to go back home, but all we're taken for \"paying customers and clients\" (does a coupon not count as a paying customer?). She passive aggressively suggested we should have come in sooner, even though I explained we weren't even in the same state. There were obviously huge gaps on the calendar open on her computer screen, but she assured me they were all booked until the day after we left. Convenient.  The desk lady then explained that I could just give the coupon to someone else (something she had already told me on the phone we could not do), so after being lied to the first time I asked her to write it on the coupons. She only wrote it on one and I had to ask her to wrote it on both. I'm pretty sure she will still try to argue about it with the poor souls who we may or may not give these coupon to.  The cherry on the cake was that after being lied to and offered no practical help to get us our second massage; I was chased out into the parking lot by the desk lady asking for a tip. I explained that I don't tip for the level of service and unprofessionalism we experienced (mostly her fault). Never done that in my life. She gave me a guilt trip about how the ladies were on commission and also passive aggressively indicated that I was unaware of the cultural norms in America. Ha! I'm pretty sure being drunk on the job is not up to cultural norms in America either. I explained that I would not tip for that kind of service and for being treated as a second class customer to their \"paying\" clients.  This is the first negative review I've ever posted on yelp and probably a waste of time. But I wrote it because the level of customer service from the desk lady WAS REALLY THAT BAD! I left asking the question, why offer a coupon on LivingSocial if you're going to treat those paying customers like garbage? Still a mystery to me.  Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"This is a review reference a visit my wife encounted regarding SpaMassage For You in Scottsdale.  See her review listed under LoriC.    One of the owners, Beverly, provided the response listed below.  She neglected to address the fact that they did not honor the voucher in full.  This was not about funds, or a misunderstanding.  This was strictly about this business not honoring the Living Social voucher in full.  As a successful business owner, I use Groupon and Living Social on occasion.  The purpose is to bring in new clients, and hope that they will potentially use our services in the future.  Never at any time would I speak to a client the way the male owner spoke to my wife.  Never at any time would I neglect to honor a special in full.  Never at any time would I try to extort additional monies from my clients.    Nowhere in the description or the Fine Print of the voucher does it state that you will receive better treatment if you join their membership program; nor does it state that if you don't purchase anything additional that you cannot use your voucher until a minimum of 5 weeks out (or 8 weeks which is what the male owner quoted my wife as he was yelling at her).    Beverly, and anyone else reading this review:  Be crystal clear on this; there was absolutely no confusion on my wife's part.  The coupons are crystal clear.  The two 90 minute massages were paid for, in full, in advance.  SpaMassage for You did not honor the services promised in the voucher.  You will not be receiving any positive feedback or future business from us, our family or friends.     7/4/2014  *Hi Lori,  We appreciate your review on Yelp.  First of all we would like to honor our promotion for a free foot scrub for giving us a review on yelp.    I am sorry for the confusion regarding our policies when you came in on July 2/14.  We explained to you about our loyalty rate program $49 per hour, prepaying for 1 massage in advance to get a great discount with the therapist of your choice.  (no contract).  You stated that you did not have the funds that day, so we worked with you to get the payment by the end of the next business day and you thanked us for being understanding.   Unfortunately, we did not hear from you within that time period so our verbal agreement of the loyalty member discount became void, but you are always eligible to pay for our full priced massage of  $59.00 per hour which you declined as well.  Members of our spa loyalty or not (pre paid or full priced services), will have first opportunity to book their appointments with the therapist of their choice within 1 to 2 weeks depending on availability.  Coupons that are highly discounted receive our newer therapists looking to build their client base.  Based upon the availability of these therapists, we are booking about 5 weeks out.    We offered your husband the loyalty rate pricing to see Kelly to get him in sooner but you declined this as well.  I am sorry that your expectations were not met, these are our policies, and we wish you the best of luck finding a spa that meet your needs.  Regards, SpaMassage For You"}
{"text":"I needed a new masseuse after the one I had been going to for 3 years lost her job after the location closed.  This place is close to my house so I stopped in to get a feel for the place before I booked an appointment. It is located in a strip center, very basic, but clean and comfortable with a relaxing vibe. The front desk personnel were very friendly and accommodating. I gave them a try with an hour massage with Travia and she was great.  She really knows her anatomy and was able to work on my problem areas to give me immediate relief.  Since I have some health issues that require regular massage therapy and it had been a while since my last massage I was pretty bound up.  So I booked a 90 minute massage for a few days later. Travia was again able to focus on my problem areas and really give me some great relief.  She is an awesome masseuse with a very pleasant personality.  I am so happy to have found a new place for regular massages.  And a big bonus is they offer you a nice discounted rate if you prepay for your next massage.  No contracts and requirements like Massage Envy.  Oh, and another really nice thing - one hour massage is one hour of hands on, not 50 minutes like so many other places. A 90 minute massage means you are massaged for 90 full minutes. This place and Travia have my business!  Try them - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I tried calling to inquire about a spray tan and the lady was talking to me on the phone and trying to talk to other people and every time I would ask a question the lady wouldn't know the answer or she would say \" What\" she would make me repeat the question because she was too busy helping others.  I decided to go in and get a spray tan with my sister she went first and when she came out she looked like she rolled herself in cigarette ashes it was green/black looking she literally had streaks all over it was not sprayed evenly it was the worst spray tan I have ever seen in my life. I should have known it was going to turn out horrible  because of how unprofessional she was when I tried to inquire information and set up an appointment. This was the worst service I have ever seen in my life. The lady's  name was Tracy."}
{"text":"SpaMassage is the best massage place around. I go every other week for an hour and a half. By far the best deep tissue/therapeutic massages I have ever received. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. The prices are by far hands down the best you will find for then excellent quality of massage that you will receive. It's always very peaceful and quiet - I have fallen asleep more than once during a session! I always recommend SpaMassage for You to anyone and everyone looking for a great massage."}
{"text":"Bought a Living Social Voucher for two 90 minute massages.  Every time I called to book they wanted to book three weeks out or longer because they gave their members appointments first.  Was told if I wanted to book a last minute massage to look to massage envy or another place.  When I finally booked a massage it was ok, not amazing.  When I booked my second massage they tried to change the time the morning of, and then instead of 90 minutes gave me a 60 minute massage the day of, and never bothered to explain why or even acknowledge they cut my massage by 30 minutes.  As I was checking out I was asked why I waited so long to use my groupon, since I bought it in June.  When I explained it had been difficult to book, I was told that was the problem with purchasing through a third party.  Are you kidding me?  Did someone force your business to offer a Living Social deal?  They were rude, inhospitable, and down right off putting.  I have never written a review before but they were so awful on the phone, in person and in general that I had to write this.  Avoid this place, at least massage envy gives a consistently good massage without all the attitude."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for awhile at SpaMassage For You, Pete is my guy - but I am sure they have someone for everyone.  It is friendly and accommodating to my schedule.  Most of all it is very affordable.  I think anyone would be very happy with the service and staff here.  I look forward to every visit."}
{"text":"I hated this massage. Period.  At one point the therapist climbed up on top of me, straddled me from behind, and I felt really uncomfortable. There was also no sheet on the bed and I had only the blanket covering me, I hope it wasn't see through.  There was no music except for therapist's heavy breathing. Awful and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I visited this place on 7/27 after finder them on SpaFinder. My Fiance & I had received a couple of Gift Cards for our recent engagement and decided we could use a Massage. I went on SpaFinders website to finder a merchant who accept their SpaFinder Gift Cards and I stumbled across SpaMassage For You. I checked out the Yelp reviews prior to visiting the business and the majority of bad reviews were placed by disgruntled Groupon users. First off, I don't think the majority of Groupon users are Cheap like some of these other reviews state. I think that without clear and concise Fine Print things are easily confused. My issue comes from the fact that prior to going to this business, I looked ALL OVER for any fine print, restrictions, exclusions, or anything at all regarding the usage of my SpaFinder Gift Cards. When I say ALL OVER, I mean I look on the merchants website, I looked on the merchants SpaFinder page, I looked on SpaFinders Website, and I also looked on the Gift Cards themselves... There was ZERO restrictions stated anywhere. Needless to say at the time of payment I handed over my Gift Cards and I was promptly told that the Gift Cards weren't accepted on the weekends and that I would have to come back another day to use them. I was also told that I should have said something when I was scheduling the appointment. I gladly obliged to pay and still tipped the Therapists over 20% on the service, this was because I actually thought I might have missed something somewhere, somehow. The reason for this review is because I went back and looked everywhere, AGAIN, and still couldn't find anything. So I called SpaFinder's Customer Service and asked if there were any restrictions or stipulations to how their Gift Cards are used. The Representative quickly and easily told me no, there are NO restrictions on the usage of their Gift Cards. At that point it was very easy to tell that there was some sort of share on the value of the Gift Cards between SpaFinder and the merchant, which is evident in why they didn't want to accept the Gift Cards. I am by no means a \"cheap\" person and I FIRMLY believe that you pay for what you get.. But if I have a Gift Card given to be as a gift, why wouldn't I attempt to use it? It's unfortunate because I was looking for a Spa to become a frequent customer at because I realized the importance of getting massages done regularly. I would've considered calling this Spa 'home' had it not been for this experience. There's no excuse for not accepting the Gift Cards and if they honestly don't accept the Gift Cards on weekends (even though SpaFinder clearly said they cannot make up their own rules on accepting their Gift Cards) then they should be the ones to have that clearly stated somewhere, ANYWHERE. ~~~ ON A GOOD NOTE ~~~ The Therapists were very talented, nice, and seemed to truly care about what you were looking to get out of the service. They were all pretty friendly and although they were remodeling, I'm sure it will be a beautiful place upon it's completion. Just make sure to spell out anything and everything you intend on doing or using at the business as they do not do it for you.  UPDATE: Merchants responding to Yelp reviews is crucial, so I appreciate the quick response. However, I still do not feel as if the response is justified in regards to my issue. First off, there was never any communication regarding the price I was receiving being Discounted, especially since there isn't anywhere for me to see pricing for Services. Secondly, the excuse given to me by you after my appointment was that you do not accept the gift cards on the weekends. Nothing was ever mentioned about it being due to a discounted rate. Lastly, if given the option, I would've preferred to be charged the normal price of $79 because it actually would have ended up being a less amount for me out of pocket. Whether it be $49 or $79, they are both still very fair priced amounts, so this is not the issue. The issue is the lack of communication as well as the fact that even if the services were discounted by you, SpaFinder specifically & clearly explained that merchants on their website that list they accept SpaFinder Gift Cards have no control over dictating how those Gift Cards are used. To avoid future complaints or issues similar to mine, maybe you should consider asking potential customers if they plan on using any coupons, or gift cards for the service.  UPDATE 8/17: This merchant has repeatedly lied to cover their tracks. They told SpaFinder that not only did we not present the Gift Cards at the time of the appointment, but they stayed open later for us and made special arrangements. You guys are cheapskates and worse than the \"cheap\" groupon people you say come to your business and screw you guys. Well good for them, liars tend to get what they deserve. Unfortunately for you, you're not smart liars and I have taken screenshots of your responses in regards to you REFUSING to accept the Gift Cards."}
{"text":"Deceptive business practices, and lies over the phone:  I used a livingsocial deal to book a couple's massage. This was done 25 days ago, and only today, four days before the appointment, I received a call stating that I could not use the voucher for a couple's massage, because of a note in the fine print that all services should be redeemed by the same customer.   I explained over the phone that the advertisement on livingsocial stated the following: \"Massages can be used by one person, two people in separate rooms, or a couple\". The woman I spoke to encouraged me to contact livingsocial, on the pretense that they were the ones forcing spamassage to abide by the small print, and assured me that spamassage would be more than happy to allow me to use the voucher for a couple's massage, so long as I had livingsocial's permission.   Well, I called livingsocial, and the woman on the phone was very friendly and put me on hold while she contacted spamassage to explain the situation and to advocate in my favor. Imagine my surprise when she told me that it was in fact spamassage who would not honor the advertisement, hiding behind the fine print to ask for extra money.   If spamassage did not want people to use the voucher for a couple's massage, perhaps they should not have put it in the ad! And certainly, they should not have blamed their mistake on livingsocial. I'm disappointed in such poor business practice, but most of all, I'm deeply frustrated at having been lied to on the phone."}
{"text":"First Impressions mean a lot. I can not rate the massage experience because I canceled based on the scheduling/interrogation when I called to make an appointment.  This, along with the push to prepay over the phone, turned me off completely.   Based on reviews and comments from a friend I have no doubt the quality of service is good.  However, this impersonal and even a bit snooty communication style practiced by the receptionist is a red flag for me.  If the owner/management is engaged closely with the day to day operations I hope they read yelp reviews.  This is an opportunity to improve your business image in this real-time social media environment in which we live.  AG"}
{"text":"I can only share what MY experience was.....and the owner asked me not to reveal my experience, therefore I will.   I received a Groupon massage and was told if I wanted to use my debit card to tip my therapists, I would be charged $1 per $10 to cover the costs the spa incurs for the transaction. When I balked at this, the guy at the desk explained that they encourage clients to use cash to avoid these fees in addition to what the therapist would then be obligated to claim as taxable income. So to help the business avoid fees and therapists avoid taxes, they prefer cash transactions as often as possible.   Groupon asked me to review my experience and I told them my experience. I didn't look for trouble and didn't look for a way to bad mouth this company, Groupon asked for me review!! The following is a copy of the emails that followed that review. Make your own judgments.     Response to Your Groupon Comment  Hi carolyn,  SpaMassage For You has sent you this message in response to your feedback:   SpaMassage For You   (spamassageforyou@hotmail.com):  Can you please let me know by email on who would have said this to you as this is totally is against our company policy and we will have to reprimand the person who said this. support@spamassageforyou.com. Thank you for the feedback. We would have really appreciated if you let our management know of this before you left the building so we could take care of this right then and there so we could have recitified this immediately. Your Comment   (August 14, 2013): I cannot believe you told a client that you wanted cash to avoid tax obligation-stupid and unethical. Why would you tell a client that? What if I worked for the IRS? ___________________________________________________________________ carolyn burr   8/17/13  To: support@spamassageforyou.com Hope this helps. The person who told me this was who I assumed IS the manager! He was the only man I saw there on the day I was there. Short man, I think he was bald or cut very short, and I think he had glasses but I have pretty much eliminated most details because I don't intend to go back-for the reasons already discussed.   Seems that it would be easy enough to identify the person. A man, I think I was there August 5 at 1230. Good luck ________________________________________________________________ support (support@spamassageforyou.com) 8/17/13  To: carolyn burr Unfortuately you are saying things that are untrue. You dont know how we run our business that is completey on the level.  Your comments without any facts or truths are uncalled for. You are exactly why small businesses fail because you say wrongful things on written forums that are completely untrue.

{"text":"I have never been more disrespected in my life then I was today. I called to set up an appointment for my free message. Apparently they won't honor my free message cause I didn't prepay for another message. This makes no sense to me. How could you offer a free message if you have to prepay for the service? I was told during my last visit that they would honor my message. Instead of this happening   the owner called me up and instantly started yelling at me how I'm not worth his time and he isn't going to give me a message. As I tried to explain what I was told he instantly started talking over me and arguing with whatever I was saying and started calling me a liar.  I'm disgusted with this companies customer service.  If you like mediocre messages and liked to be disrespected this is the place to go!  This place continues to sicken me. They have the nerves to call me up after I post my review and continue to attack me. Tell how I have made them angry now and basically called me dumb for not understanding their \"policies\". They should of been clear on day one what their \"policies\" were and what they were doing with my stamp card. Instead they just come up with their own rules on what they want to do when they want to do it.  Point proven on how horrible these people are. They harassed me In phone calls and continue with their reply to my comment. When I was handed my stamp card Beverly stamped it for both of us. Never offered each of us our own and continued telling us that when we get it filled out one of us could use it for a free hour massage or split it up. When I told Beverly we were moving she gave me my last stamp and said no could use it and get my free massage.  When they found out we weren't going to continue with their business they started attacking me on honoring what they promised. A professional company would have apologized for the miscommunication instead of instantly getting nasty. What you guys lost out on is a positive word of mouth for your business."}

{"text":"My husband and I have regular massages and have high expectations. We were more than happy and surprised with this place. My husband had Alice; she was able to get to his trouble spots within the shoulder blades. He was loosened up so much that he could maintain proper posture with no effort. I had Kelly D; she was excellent with pressure points. I informed KD of my recent hiking trip; she knew exactly the place to relieve the tension. We highly recommend Alice and KD."}
{"text":"I gave this one star only because I had to, otherwise they would have gotten none. I used a groupon to try it for the first time to see if I liked it. The location itself is in a strip mall and the entrance is uninviting and seems disheveled. The massage was good, but I couldn't get over the squeaky table that constantly moved. I thought it would break at any point in the massage. Then to top it off, I rated them on groupon saying these things so they would improve and they responded with a snarky, rude message. Definitely not the way to run a business! Don't go there, not worth the money or the poor treatment!"}
{"text":"I went to the spa expecting a great massage with a name like spa massage for you however the owner, who checked me in, did not even know what forms I should fill out. Then the massage therapist's pressure was too hard.  I had to keep reminding her the whole hour to lighten up. The facial bed was atrocious. it was like a giant clam that would close up.  I had to lay still. The place did not seem that clean. Nor was it a relaxing atmosphere."}

{"text":"In town from NYC on business. I had some free time so why not get a massage?! I must begin by stating that I should get massages a lot more often since I hold tension like I'm walking across the street with a 2 year old. Anyway, my masseuse was Katrina - a beautiful black woman who knew how to do her job. Prior to the massage, she asked what I wanted her to focus on & I never know how to answer this question. What I did tell her is how much tension I hold and that I needed forceful deep tissue assistance.   She was thorough and strong. Needless to say I'm in pain but it was necessary. She only was able to scratch the surface on the kind of therapy I need but now I'm at least at a beginning point. If you need a different kind of treatment, inform her and she'll comply. She's fabulous and I highly recommend her services. In fact, if I lived here, I would be a regular to this place & Katrina would be my masseuse.   Go here, you won't be disappointed. And tell Katrina I said hi!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year and a half, my first visit being b/c of a Groupon. I had no difficulties scheduling the initial appointment and they offered to continue to honor the Groupon price for my next appointment if I paid in advance. I continued on in that fashion for quite some time with no issues. The first massage therapist I had was great and saw her several times before she left and I was then bounced around to a different massage therapist each month, it always seemed like no one stuck around very long.  The place is small and doesn't have an over the top spa-like ambiance. No lavish furnishings or ultra serene atmosphere here, but they get the job done. The rooms are small and walls seem thin- depending on what room you're in you may hear sounds from the lobby or hallway during your massage. My only real complaint would be an awkward encounter about six months ago when I was dealing with some family issues and had to reschedule my appointment. By the time I got around to calling, it was only a few hours before the original appointment time, and I got a lecture over the phone for not calling 24 hours in advance. I was not aware of this policy but I do understand it. I was informed that they would let it slide this once and that the next time it happened, I would be charged.  When I showed up for the appointment a week or so later, I received another lecture in the lobby about having rescheduled my appointment. I thought this additional barrage was uncalled for and an unacceptable way to treat clientele in any industry but especially when your customer comes to your place of business expecting serenity and relaxation. I was ready to break up with them when Katrina gave me one of the best massages evvvvverrrrrr! Soooo, I stuck around for several more months seeing Katrina each time. She is fantastic! Sweet disposition, and amazing with her hands.  Overall, I've never gotten a bad massage here, but I do think that there is room for improvement in the customer service department. The only reason I am taking a hiatus from regularly scheduled massages is due to personal financial reasons and has nothing to do with the business itself."}
{"text":"This place is around 20 miles from us, but I'm happy to make that trek twice a month for the level of service, professionalism and quality I get here.    Neil and Beverly are great! There personable, and they care about customers' satisfaction.  My wife sees Neil, and I see Beverly. I have fibromyalgia, so I'm really careful about who works on me. Too many masseuses listen to what you (avoid my left shoulder is one of my biggies) but then they just do whatever once things are underway.  Beverly was a nurse, so I trust her to work on me without hurting me. She's always been very careful and respectful of my needs. She's also great about fitting me in at the last minute if I have a particularly bad day.  And if you book your next appointment before you leave you get a significant discount. Always great!  I see some people claim to have had issues with with courtesy, but I've never seen Neil be anything but helpful and respectful. He's always been willing to work with customers from what I've seen.  Just remember that people tend to only leave reviews when they're upset. You're not hearing from all of the happy, relaxed customers I see each time I'm there. People are always pleased with the offer to save by rebooking, and I've literally only heard it turned down 3 times in the 3 years I've been going there."}

I've worked in retail and retail management, real estate, the title & escrow, cosmetics representative, and other professions of service and I have NEVER come across this level of Unethical Level of Business Practice!! Thank you for saving me from experiencing what I am sure would have been a poor massage!  (Most likely they run a matchbox car up and down your back and call it good)!!! I work with locals, tourists and hundreds of employees that I will be sure to warn about this Scam Outfit!! Maybe if you don't use a Dreaded Coupon or Groupon maybe you're treated differently but that shouldn't be the case! And poor Groupon for linking to them- it gives Groupon a bad impression if you're treated like a second class customer if you're redeeming a coupon."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Spamassage. The hot stone massage with Pete is the best I've had! Cannot wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience we had last night at Spa Massage for You.  Our former fabulous massage therapist moved a few years ago, and we've been trying different places ever since to try to recreate massage heaven.   Last night was as close as it gets.  My husband and I booked 90 minute massages, he with Peter and I with Lisa.  The owner, Neal, was very pleasant and welcoming, as were all the staff.  He gave us a bit of his history while we waited a few minutes for one therapist who was caught in crazy hail/snow weather (in Phoenix!) and, to accommodate our having to wait, gave us extra massage minutes.   The massage was a FULL 90 MINUTES, which is atypical, and done completely professionally.  The therapists found all the usual knots - plus a few more - and checked regularly regarding comfort, pressure, etc.  They offer fabulous rates if you rebook when you check out ($54 for a 90 minute massage!)  This place is almost too good to be true.  Go soon, and be very blessed."}
{"text":"Spa Massage For You has helped me with very painful spinal issues that create pain for my hip and leg.  Neal  is a wonderful therapist who has helped making daily living that much better by his expertise in massage, suggesting exercises that might be helpful and his caring attitude.  So glad I found Neal and Spa Massage For You."}
{"text":"I had to write my very first review because this experience was so bad.  This was the most horrible customer service I ever experienced. They knew I had a Living Social special and couldn't book an appt for me for a few weeks. 3 days before my appt on June 26, Beverly called to say they would need to reschedule because their remodeling was not done yet. Because of my Living Social deal, the appt would need to be pushed out a month. They've already had other days booked for actual paying clients. I didn't realize when using Living Social, I wasn't considered a paying customer. The best response I heard from her was that according to the special, it didn't expire until Jan so she was within her rights to book me into Nov if she wanted to. Ended up speaking with the owner, Neil, and he rambled and spoke over me. He also said something along the lines of his business only making money with repeat business. Since I live in the west valley, he doesn't believe I will be a repeat customer. At this point, I'm not even going to be a first time customer."}
{"text":"Best massage ever!  Trevia was my therapist, she 's amazing, I kid you not!  My husband also says it's the best massage he's ever had.  Try this place, you will not regret it.  Also they offer lots of different ways to make your massages affordable. Just ask."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since December and i've been very satisfied with their all around service. From being greeted right when you walk in, to leaving the place and everything in between, I always feel so relaxed and appeased. Unlike other spas,  my first time there I was greeted by an owner at the front and after talking briefly with the woman (Beverly), I already felt at home. Welling up noticeably, they embraced me with a level of compassion that impressed me immensely. After spending a full hour (and a little more) with my masseuse (Mary), I was in awe of how professional and nice she was making sure my requests of my hurt back was served even though we went over an hour... then managed to compose herself in order to afford the next patient the attention they deserved. I knew from that moment on that I will be coming back to this place on a regular basis. Not only are the people great, but the noise and background music was just perfect. Thank you, SpaMassage for your desire to develop such amazing customer relations while effectively doing your work. -Jamie"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience at a SpaMassage for you. Kelly D. did a fantastic job on my tight neck and shoulders. Very relaxing atmosphere... you don't hear cars going by or loud noises outside the door, as I have at other massage places. Great deals too, just ask before leaving. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"You're apologizing now and are offering to discuss this matter further after you send me the below passive aggressive message, I don't think so. Maybe if you treated your customers with respect you'd still have one who would be loyal and give excellent word of mouth reviews for your small business. And, don't you worry, there are many other day spas in the valley who are able and have accommodated my needs since this horrible experience with you.   Beverly K. Business Owner We want to thank you for your feedback today. We do appreciate all comments whether they are positive or negative. All comments make us a stronger company each and everyday and we hope your experience at another day spa goes more according to what you are looking for. All the best!!!  Regards,  Neal Owner SpaMassage For You"}
{"text":"I adore this place, not only their employees, but their business model as well.   It was my significant other's and my anniversary, and they got me in for a couple's massage at the last minute (same day) because another company had cancelled our couples massage earlier that morning. They did what they could to accommodate us and make us feel welcome and comfortable on our special day. They also went ABOVE AND BEYOND with regards to preparing the room and making sure we were comfortable and knew what to expect and how to proceed.   The 2 individuals that gave us a massage, Cindy and Karen, were great at what they did, consistently asked if we were ok and comfortable with the level of pressure, the areas they were covering, etc.  The only downfall was the sales tactics when we came out, they definitely went all salesy on us afterward.  However, because i was overall a great experience, and I went ahead and purchased another massage for the future and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What an awful place! They refuse to accept the groupon they put out because it's not profitable for them... They make excuse after excuse why they can't get you in. They are extremely rude and nasty when you inquire about it. And if you post a negative review about them they will refuse you service... Maybe you shouldn't promise people something you are unwilling to deliver!!!  Pieces of shit"}
{"text":"Spa Message for You is a great place for a relaxing  therapeutic massage!  Just what your achy body needs & deserves!  Owner Neal has really helped me with neck & back tension, & he has a team of experienced massage therapists on staff providing a variety of therapeutic massages.  I think you'll be recommending Spa Massage for You too!"}
{"text":"I bought a living social deal for a 90 minute massage and facial.  I had booked to go here on my birthday but they called me a few days ahead of time to let me know the esthetician could not make it in for my facial.  I rebooked for the next weekend, and again got called because they didn't have an esthetician.  They ended up offering me a two hour massage in place of voucher, which I accepted.  I went in for my appointment today and it was a great experience.  Front desk staff was awesome, very sweet girl.  My massage therapist Kat, was PHENOMENAL! The entire 2 hours she hit every muscle, knot, sore spot, and just has an all around fantastic technique.  The facility is a little lack luster, worn, and quaint...but I didn't expect a full day spa.  You can hear a lot of chatting outside the treatment room but only for a few minutes as they change out customers.  This place is busy, and I assume it is because their staff seems awesome.  They offered me some smokin deals on my way out.  $90 for 3 one hour massages!  Needless to say I jumped at that!  I (obviously) will be back...even if it is 30 minutes from my house."}
{"text":"I have severe lumbar disk problems. I had heard about SpaMassage and Pete, and stumbled across a nice coupon deal.  On the first appointment, Pete wanted details about my situation and was very thorough. He moved and worked slowly and methodically through the trouble areas, with deep pressure, rolling pressure and stretching at just the right spots. He really seemed to intuitively grasp my peculiar injuries, arthritic conditions, etc.  I've been back to see him several times, and if you buy the next one on the way out the door, you get a nice discount.  Give it a try; if you know the kind of technique that works best for you, ask about the therapists to see who is the best fit."}
{"text":"I decided to take the four hands massage. It will be difficult to go back to the one person massage. Having medical issues with my legs and they gave the correct name to the condition without me saying the name them what it might be and worked on the area.  I scheduled another appointment for next week.  Although I have a place 1/2 mile from me (not near as good), I will continue the drive for my massages. Nice people."}
{"text":"I had a LivingSocial and got a back to back massage and facial. Both were absolutely fabulous. I like how they don't have contracts, but instead you can pay for your next visit in advance and get a discounted rate. THe only caveat is that you can't then cancel that appointment. Smart business for them. But, Zeina was my massage therapist and no one has ever been able to get as deep as her. She really knows what she is doing. I will definitely come back for massages (already have!) but not facials, as apparently they can't keep good aestheticians around."}
{"text":"Spamassage for you is the only place that I will go for my massages. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. They have great prices and always make accommodations with any type of schedules  Neil and Beverly are both wonderful. Would recommend you get a massage with either of them.   I already have purchased another massage at a wonderful discount rate and can't wait to use it."}
{"text":"About a week ago I went in for a spray tan. The tan turned out horribly and I was ashy and gray. I washed it off as soon as I got home but in some spots I was still discolored And spotty. The woman at the front desk not only treated me with disrespect but when my two year old made a noise she shushed him without even asking me to keep him quiet. She is a horrible person who the owner said was going through issues even so no child deserves to be yelled at especially if she didn't say anything to me first. After continuously arguing with me she finally gave me my money back after rolling her eyes several times and yelling at me. She ruined my day and I left in tears over the way she treated my child. Also when I asked her if it was okay if I waited for the manager with my kids because it was hot out she yelled at me saying you have a vehicle don't you. Keep them in there. Talking to the owner didn't help at all he basically stuck up for get suggesting I was cheap for using groupon and most people who use that are looking to get something for nothing. He then said \"this isn't a bribe but if you are willing to change the Yelp review we would give you a free one hour massage\" I would never step foot in that disgusting place ever again. After the condescending reply to my husbands review and many of the replys and bad reviews on here I hope everyone sees all of these before they think about coming here. Good thing when you google this place the Yelp reviews come up first so even if Google is pushing this horrible place people can see the truth.  ***this next paragraph is really long but it is in response to how the owner replied to me. If they treat people like this on Yelp I promise it's worse in person.   That's funny because when I talked to you on the phone you said you had no idea what had gone on from the other room and you would have to speak to Tracey to get her side of the story I even suggested you keep cameras in the front so you could see how she was treating people. You apologized for not being there and since you didn't hear what had gone on you couldn't comment on her behavior. Also during the whole spray tan the kids were next door and my sister in law had to bring them in with me because Tracey was rude to me when I had paid and wanted some one to witness what had gone on. Also she never asked me to keep them quiet she took it upon herself to yell at a two year old.  I don't know why you say on your reply you didn't offer a bribe but your literal words were \"this isn't a bribe but if you change your review online I will give you a free one hour massage\" You did not offer me anything for my bad service you are literally lying about what you said to me. I didn't want anything just to let you know what had transpired between me and your employee. The way you argue with me and many other people on here should show everyone exactly how your business is ran. And the only reason I posted a review in addition to my husbands. And my sister in laws(who was there the whole time) is how rude you continue to be in your responses to not only the people I know but many strangers. If you weren't so condescending and smug I would have let it go.  Yes of course I want her fired she screamed at my son which you could care less about. And to say I do a lot of reviews is also a lie. My profile is not private everyone can look and see this is the very first Yelp review I have done in my life. Please everyone feel free to check that."}
{"text":"Update to my previous review.  My mother-in-law had purchased a pre-paid massage when we visited in August, so I returned with her.  Today I have to update my review to say that I LOVED my massage.  I had my massage with  Beverly and she was awesome.  The place was warmer than the last time...not as chilly.  Given my new experience I would say to give 'em a try.  I would probably go back if I lived closer to get the awesome massage from Beverly."}
{"text":"Went back and Shana was not there.  Had an unremarkable facial from a new girl.  Just wasnt the same.  Ehhh."}
