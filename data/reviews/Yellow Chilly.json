{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a quick dinner. It was about 25 minutes before we got our food, so not super-quick. 
The Ma Po Tofu he ordered was delicious. I got the szechuan chicken - not so good. The chicken pieces were fried in what tasted like old oil - almost burnt. 
The entire time we were eating, the staff ignored us, staying in the kitchen laughing at something the entire time. We wanted more rice but never got the chance to ask, and the waitress never even asked how things were. Likely, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here four times now. Excellent food I mean really good with a lot of ingredients, healthy, deliciously flavourful, and always warm. It's run by a very sweet husband and wife. Atmosphere is very relaxing and comfortable. I think I'm addicted to their food. I'll add some pics."}
{"text":"It is located in a small plaza with KFC and Tim Hortons. 
It was dark inside and he of tens open later than listed in the window,
1:00pm and beyond would be safe, also safe to call first. I ordered the 
Chilly chicken with gravy and manchurian chicken with gravy. 
$10.00 per dish and quantity and quality are there."}
