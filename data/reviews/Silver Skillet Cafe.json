{"text":"Had breakfast there on Monday with my friends. Everything came out fast,  fresh and delicious.  The service was great and our waitress was super sweet and friendly. We will definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"We were actually on our way to our usual Sunday breakfast spot when a detour on Mayfield Road took us past this plaza. We are always on the look out for new places to eat (especially breakfast!!) and we had no idea this little place was here (less than a mile from where we usually go). We decided to stop in and check it out.  The breakfast portion of the menu was a little small but I had no complaints because they have eggs Benny which is my all time favorite- and a good dish for judging culinary skill. It was delish! The hollandaise was perfect and plentiful (just the way I like it). Although the dish didn't come with potatoes I ordered a side of home fries- they were a little too crispy for my liking, probably deep fried with lots of tiny little pieces.  My fianc√© ordered the corned beef hash- it came out looking like it was canned but he said it surely tasted homemade and he loved it.  My only real complaint is they were out of silverware for a while while we were there and we had to ask a few separate times for spoons to stir our coffee and again for cream. Our server was very kind but the other girl who was helping (another server I think?) who sat us and got our drink ordered acted like we were bothering her. Overall, I'd definitely go back. Not sure how this place hasn't been reviewed yet, I think they've been open a while!"}
{"text":"Took forever to order, food took forever to come out. Orders were incorrect and it was all super bland. Not a great place, won't come back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My kids and I have gotten take away ~4 times...dinner only. Meatloaf, stuffed cabbage, burgers, salads...all delicious. Is it all homemade from scratch? No...gravy for instance is bottled or a powder packet. I don't mind. It's a down home diner of comfort food and I expect some fakeness. That's okay by me....especially when we're talking about their Boston cream pie...yum! People are super friendly and I feel good supporting a local establishment."}
{"text":"Just terrible.my waiter was a young heavy set man.pants showing is cracked and keeps playing with his nose.disgusting.i ordered a cheese sausage omelet and rye toast.thank good Ness my food was served by young lady.coffee was fine  but that was only good part.my potatoes were deep fried served cold no seasoning and very hard.obviously over cooked and placed on the side until served.my omelet was maybe 2 eggs or very small.there were five prices of sausage and very little cheese.the toast was marbled cold and hardly toased."}
{"text":"This is our go to for Sunday morning breakfast. The specials are amazing!! Maple Cinnamon Pancakes , Cherry Crumble French Toast to name a few.  Kevin and Shelly are always coming up with new and different entrees. They don't rest on their laurels and there is never a dull moment. Friday dinners are excellent as are their lunches. They always use fresh ingredients. Kevin always comes out to say hello and is so personable as is Shelly who cooks and can only come out when the restaurant isn't busy which isn't often!! Travis, you rock!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on a little Saturday jaunt to pick up some vintage furniture from a local biz.  She recommended it.  How tasty and nice!  Got seated immediately for brunch and the coffee was fresh.  My H and I each chose the country fried steak:  Disclaimer:  I should have asked for no potatoes, as I don't care for them, but I tasted them and they were good.  The gravy was great!  Eggs were perfectly over easy.  Our bill was $16.97 for two and I think it was a steal.  Warning:  only open until 2."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  Everything we ordered was delicious!  The country skillet, eggs Benedict, and waffle were all excellent and plentiful.  This a small gem storefront restaurant, with outstanding food, big portions, and great service."}
{"text":"Nice place. Can feel the family like vibe that the staff has. Food came out fast and cooked well. Good job to the owners and staff."}
{"text":"After waiting for about 40 minutes for a Mac and cheese and burger we left.  Not sure about the food but the table next to us sent back their food because there was an issue with the fryer.   Did not get a good vibe and don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"Great little cafe with fresh food. The club was huge. Service was great and they kept the kids entertained. Recommend trying. Only wish they had coke instead of Pepsi ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and extremely generous portions at a modest price! Service is consistently friendly every week! The eggs Benedict is among the best I've ever had. The breakfast sandwich on a croissant exceeds expectations; not your standard dry croissant but a large, buttery soft, flaky monstrosity with 2 slices of the most amazing bacon and the most perfectly melted cheddar cheese I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I met a friend at the silver skillet today. We all loved out food and the service was great. The last time we came I wrote a review asking to be offered real maple syrup with my pancakes and this time when I ordered the pancakes I was offers real maple syrup with out asking!!! Keep it up guys, you guys have a loyal customer here!"}
