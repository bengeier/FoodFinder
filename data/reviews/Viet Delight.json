{"text":"As others mentioned, this is literally a whole in a wall. The plaza parking is always full at night thanks to the bar in the middle. 
The food is decently priced. The menu was simple. We've ordered their rice platters combo and a side order of spring rolls. The spring roll and chicken was tasty. My only complaint is  the pork chop, it's so thin compare to other viet places. It's as thin as sliced cheese. 
Will come back for sure but I'd probably not get the pork chop again."}
{"text":"The meals here are cheap, $10 or less taxes included. The food tastes pretty good (rice, pork chop, chicken, fried egg, veggies) for about $7.50 before taxes. Portion to price ratio is good, give you a bit of everything but not too much or too less. Tastes like homemade food, no complaints. Better than average food for better pricing than most places."}
{"text":"If you want light and flavorful pho, this place is the best in the Durham area. I would even say that this little mom and pop shop is one of my top pho places, and I'm from Markham. Their small bowls is the medium size of other restaurants. The flank was top quality meat and not the cheap cut and frozen type. Honestly, I had a nose congestion when i was eating thepho and I was able to taste the yumminest from the broth!"}
{"text":"we did take out our first visit and we were very pleased with our meal.  The spring rolls were huge and tasty and we both had the  soup small well done beef  with rice noodles, Very good.  A must try if you like Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Called and placed an order for pickup and was told they would be open until 7pm. Arrived at 5pm to a locked door. Called and asked why the door was locked and was told 'everyone decided to go home early.' 

You have customers placing orders and hours posted,  but decide to go home early. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I am a vietnamese food junkie.  I know viet food. Trust me when i say this is the ONLY hardcore vietnamese restaurant in Ajax. Everything here tastes homemade and authentic. You know why?  Because the owners and cook are vietnamese - not chinese like most gta vietnamese locations. And they are vietnamese who can cook!!  The pho broth is clean and void of msg overload.  I can drink the broth no problem. 

I work in toronto. In toronto i only go to 2 places for good pho and rice dishes. For pho its pho tien thanh;  for rice dishes its pho linh. 

This place has both good pho and rice dishes!  Moving to Ajax comes with its ups and downs. But this place is the hidden gem in ajax - where the restaurant scene is crowded by south asian, Caribbean and Afghanistan oriented cuisine.

We love it here and its our only choice for vietnamese food even though we live next door to pho metro (crap)."}
{"text":"Visited this place today for lunch. The portions are good for the price and the food is fresh. We both had the beef noodle soup with rare beef, brisket and meatballs and it was good but the broth was a little on the salty side. The springroll was also crispy and big. Would come back here again and probably try the beef stew with rice noodle."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good asian cuisine in Ajax when you're only there once a week and there's not as much heavy Yelp action, but this place came with some great reviews, and we gave it a shot.

We ordered a pho soup noodles with rare beef and beef balls. They actually missed the meat and ended up cooking some extra for my boyfriend which was very kind of her :) I ordered the bun. I like the grilled/ bbq meat with the vermicelli swimming in veggies and sauce. It was a great balance of flavours and generous portions at a decent price. 

Usually, I grab an avocado milk shake along with my meal, but we decided to try their lemon soda. I'm not sure what she puts in it for sweetener, but this is absolutely the most delicious lemon soda I've had. I let her know how much I loved it and she proudly let me know that it's a customer favourite. :) Don't forget to try it out if you get a chance to swing by. 

This place is rather small, seating just a few tables at a time, but service is quick and the over all dining experience is pleasant. In and out within 30-45 minutes. It's a solid vietnamese location that I'll definitely be swinging by again soon!"}
{"text":"Hair in my soup once, shame on you.

Hair in my soup twice, shame on me.

I used to love this place for its reliably tasty pho. But then it came under new ownership and everything went downhill. 

Since I work three minutes away from here, I even gave it several chances. But they messed up my order a bunch of times, and on at least one occasion I had to leave hungry because it took too long to bring me the correct order...I had to run back to work. Anyway, the second time I found a hair in my food??? PEACE OUT. Never again."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place is now under new ownership.  A big improvement from the previous owners.  Affordable prices and great portions.  With so few good Viet places in Durham, this place needs to stay in business.  I now endorse this place.   Pho was a good size with lots of meat.  A little too salty for my taste but I know many people will like it.  Fresh rolls were made FRESH, not premade like many other places."}
{"text":"Food: for the area thenfood here is pretty decent the broth and the ingredients in the pho seems to be simplified. There are only three things that can go in the pho, rare beef, beef flank, and beef balls. Although the broth tasted toned down the overall flavour was decent. The rice dish was typical of any other viet restaurant. 

Service: the service was friendly the lady that served us was always smiling and is very
 nice.

Atmosphere: this is a typical family ran Asian restauramt. It is small but cozy. 

Overall: all in all this restaurant is decent for the area and would go there again. It definitely satisfied my phone craving."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to try out the sandwich (only served on Thursdays and Fridays) and a big table of teenagers snagged all the sandwiches just as we sat down.  Gah!

Disappointed, we ordered our usual pho with rare beef and bun bo hue.  What I love about this little joint is that they serve up pretty decent bun bo hue that is actually spicy.  The broth for both pho and bun bo hue are clean, beefy and unadulterated.  Condiments are served up fresh with a smile.

The service can be slow as this tiny (20 seater) restaurant is served by one lady who serves the hall and mans the counter (presumably the owner).  

Both our first and second visit was good and the location and quality of the food makes VD a go to pho place in Durham region for me.  Sorry Pho Metro, you've lost out by dumbing-down your food in the Ajax location.

Definitely will be back to try out more stuff here!"}
{"text":"A little bit of a whole in the wall for decor, tucked in a strip mall way at the back. The food was tasty the portions for the price were fare. One of the better vietnamese restaurants in Ajax. The family run business with just two people working there was excellent. Food didn't take long to come and as it just really tasty!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The staff are always incredibly friendly and welcoming and the place itself is clean and well kept. This is my GO TO Pho joint in Ajax and I pick up food from them at least once a week. If you're craving some good traditional Pho, 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Ownership changed. This used to be my go to lunch place...not anymore after today. $8 for a small bowl of pho with 2 pcs of rare beef and ONE beef ball which took them twice as long to cook with only one other table. One beef ball. Lol. Wow. Betting this ownership won't last long! A real shame"}
{"text":"The ownership has changed recently. The service here is great, but the food quantity has gone down hill. One large bowl of pho only consisted of 3 slices of rare beef, two tendon, and 3 meat balls. Pho has always been a dish where its the best bang for your buck. But not here. The Vietnamese iced coffee was also bland."}
