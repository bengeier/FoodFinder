{"text":"We had a delicious dinner! We had the Burrata, Fennel Salad, Frisee & Lardon Salad, Meatballs, Cavetelli & Sausage and topped it off with a light Creme Brule.  Our server and he staff were terrific. Chef Alauzan has always done a wonderful job with all of his restaurants, but LeoGreta has a nice down-to-earth personal touch.  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Just recently opened. A quaint place with 38 seats. Staff was very nice and accommodating. The bread choice was hard and oil had no real flavor. The food portions were small. The meatballs seemed to be processed and didn't have much taste. The coconut cream pie really wasn't pie, but rather a tort with some cream on top. It was BYOB with a $5 per stem corking fee and $5 per person for beer. Our first & last time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the short time it has been open , both times there where both positive & negative experiences . The first time I ordered the greens & beans & the combo for lunch , the beans where undercooked & there was hardly any greens but the broth was very tasty . The combo consists of a meatball , sausage , and braised pork which unfortunately they where out of so I just doubled up on the sausage . The meatball is outstanding & possibly the best I've ever had , the sausage was also tasty . My waitress was extremely nice & her service & the meatball was enough to bring me back for a second visit . My second visit was for takeout dinner , I ordered the spaghetti & meatball & a salad , the pasta was crazy good , the sauce excellent , and the meatball again was best I've ever had . The negative on this visit was while  I was waiting for my takeout sitting at a table the waitress never asked if I would like a beverage while I waited , the restaurant only had one other table seated at the time so they where not busy so it would of been nice to been offered if I wanted anything why I waited , but she was extremely nice so maybe I'm just being to picky . I will be back again & im sure after a few more weeks of being open they will improve & I will be upgrading my review to 4 or 5 stars ."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today. Realy cute on the inside, The food was delicious, but a little too pricey, for me and for Carnegie. I had the Frisee and Lardon Salad for $ 9 and the Cavatelli and Sausage $16 OUCH. $25 for lunch way to much for this working girl, dinner fine but lunch, no way.  The portions were fair, not huge that for sure !! Maybe some pasta specials would be the way to go for lunch, they did have a couple sandwiches maybe if I go back I will just do a sandwich,for $10"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my wife here last night, the food was amazing. the only issue i really found was the bread/croutons were a little hard. otherwise the food was fantastic and will be coming by again."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner with my husband here this week and felt that it was worth the trip. Being from the North side of the city it was a short trip on the parkway that left me full and satisfied (but crossing a bridge in Pgh makes it seem like a life time away in our minds for some reason) We shared the gnocchi and a meatball as an appetizer and both were good. The gnocchi was so light and delish I could have probably ate 3 orders. For salads we had one caesar and one frisee which were both good but I liked the frisee more. If you are someone who likes creamy caesar dressing this option is not for you, this is a more authentic dressing. For dinner we enjoyed the linguini carbonara and the cavatelli & sausage. Since it was late we got a piece of flour-less chocolate cake to go that never made it home because it was sooo good. We also took our own wine with a corking charge of $5 per person. The only thing I was not a fan of was their bread (even though we still ate it all)  it was a little hard but it might just be a type of bread that I don't care for. It was also nice to have the owner come check on each table. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"LeoGreta is an adorable, small Italian restaurant in Carnegie. I had the linguine carbonara and it was the perfect portion. Unlike other Italian restaurants that give an incredibly large portion, I ate my whole meal and was not uncomfortably full. The coconut cream pie was also amazing and I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! The portions are just perfect. The sauce is amazing. Meatballs are out of this world. Just go here, okay? I have no words. Also the greens and beans are just bomb.com"}
{"text":"My mom and I went to LeoGreta to try something new in Carnegie, and we will definitely be going back! The restaurant is cozy and simple with exposed brick and a beer & wine bar in the main room. The menu was small, but offered a variety of delicious choices including 'sandos' and pasta entrees. The waitress brought out fresh bread and olive oil, and we ordered the burrata starter and split the arugula & radicchio salad. The appetizers were both very good and came out quickly. I ordered the prosciutto sando for my meal. I enjoyed it, however, there was a lot of meat on the sandwich that muted the flavors of the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. Overall everything was tasty, the staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was welcoming. I will definitely be going back to LeoGreta to try more of the delicious Italian options!"}
{"text":"So Happy to have a Top Notch Italian Restaurant close to home!!! LeoGreta absolutely knocks it out of the park. My Girlfriend and I came here at 3pm on a Tuesday, so naturally we pretty much had the place to ourselves, and the overall experience was fantastic. We started with the greens and beans, which I absolutely loved. The house made sausage puts them over the top, I especially liked them because they weren't swimming in oil like most GnB's, they are presented almost more like a soup. For our entree's I had the Cavatelli w/sausage and my GF had the linguini carbonara, both pastas(along with basically everything else) were made in house and were absolutely perfect. For dessert we had the panna cotta with honey, it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The service was fabulous and you could tell the staff was proud of their product and wanted the guests to love LeoGreta as much as they do. The Chef/Owner even came out to make sure everything was satisfactory, which you don't see very much anymore. The prices are also very reasonable. If you were to get a similar meal downtown, you'd probably pay 50% more, and I doubt the food would be as good. It's byob, so be sure to bring some wine, the cork fee is 5$ per person, which in my opinion is totally worth it. I love Sarafino's in Crafton, but it's menu is a pretty dated and the experience there is a little played out. From now on when we have a hankering for pasta, LeoGreta is our new GoTo spot."}
{"text":"Our experience here was absolutely wonderful. We showed up waaaaaayyyy more casual than I normally would brave, and with a toddler in tow, but were still welcomed with open arms (and with no reservation. Seriously, make a reservation.) The staff was delightful. Everything we had was delicious. Our daughter's pasta was awesome, and the roast beef sandwich is my new favorite dish. The burrata and prosciutto sandwich were also delish, and the pickled veggies were perfect to compliment it all. Kudos to Leogreta; I truly cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been a Chef Greg fan since his days at Eleven.   So I've been excitedly anticipating the opening of LeoGreta.   We had reservations and had to wait a while as people were lingering and there are not a lot of tables.  The hostess felt really bad and was super sweet but we were ok with waiting.   The only negative was there was absolutely no room to wait.    If there were other people waiting , or if we were with another couple, I don't know where we would have gone. It was too nasty to be outside .....    but we got seated.   We had the antipasta salad as an app.   Very tasty with olives, red peppers, soprasott and prossutio.   Also had a side of the risotto ... which we could have had a meal of!   Hubs got greens and beans ... he was a little disappointed ~ the beans were slightly underdone and he prefers a red broth over the white broth.   But the sausage in them was delish!   I had the cavatelli w sausage and kale.   I liked it all but the sausage.   It wasn't like the sausage in the beans dish.  It was crumbled & on the greasy side.   Hubby had the spaghetti and meatball.   The noodles and sauce were divine but we were both a little let down by the meatball.   It was good, not inedible , but just not our fave meatball ever.    We thought it was odd we weren't served any bread and butter or dipping oil, especially with having the pasta dishes ,,,,,   We saw some folk getting dessert and they looked scrumptious so we indulged.   I had the creme bulee which was ok.   I've had better.   He had coconut cream pie and it was one of the best desserts ever!!!!!!   We will go back ,, with a bottle of wine ,,, as I didn't know they were byob.   And the service was very very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Had the green and beans for the first course and it was excellent. For the main I had the cavatelli with sausage and was a little salty but very good.  The salt taste is from the sausage as the chief said no salt was added. My wife had the carbonara and raved about it. The atmosphere is quaint but loud.  Hard to have a conversation. Could use a little more soundproofing."}
{"text":"Went to LeoGreta with my parents when we were in town for the weekend.  They really like it and are becoming regulars.  The food was amazing and unlike others, I think the portions were good for the price.  If you want good quality homemade food, it's not cheap.  People seem to have this misconception since the chain restaurants have been able to pump out big portions at low costs for so long.   Two of us had the gnocchi, another had the cavatelli with sausage and kale and another had the spaghetti and meatball.  I, of course, tried everything.  The cavatelli was my favorite but every dish was great.  The crumbled homemade sausage was fantastic.  Not sure why someone gave it a bad review.  I could have had two bowls of this without blinking an eye. The gnocchi was so light and fluffy!  When made incorrectly you feel like you have a rock in your stomach.  This was perfect.  I will agree with others regarding the bread/oil though.  Bread wasn't to my liking.  We all shared a panna cotta.  WOW. I do not normally get desserts but this was heaven and well worth the splurge.  So creamy and delicious.    The owner came by and greeted us, made us feel welcome and checked that everything was ok.  This small gesture makes such a difference in my opinion.  Seems he wasn't real comfortable doing this which makes it all the more impressive.  You can tell cooking is a passion of his and he's very proud of his establishment - rightfully so!  I have two complaints/suggestions.  These by no means take away from my review but mention in the hope they can address to make it even better.  First, it's so loud!  The restaurant is small, intimate and very nice but hopefully they can do something to address this. We basically ate without talking to each other which was awkward. Second, our waitress was very nice but a little inattentive.  We sat for a good 10 minutes before we had to ask someone else where she was.   Maybe she's new or had an off night and am not judging on one visit but hope they keep an eye on this because it does affect your experience."}
{"text":"Went there with my boss on a business trip.  I ordered a salad with bacon.  Got a salad with what appeared to be escarole lettuce and cubed bacon in the bottom of the bowl with no dressing.  Odd salad that wasn't bad but cost about $10.  Also ordered a meatball by itself.  The meatball was good, not greasy.  However, the sauce over the meatball was some kind of canned sauce.  Not especially flavorful.  I lived in St. Louis for most of my life so I know what Italian sauce should taste like  The restaurant is new so there's no liquor license.  Its BYOB but there a corkage fee.  Would I go back?  Maybe if the company is paying for it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is small but very clean and trendy with a cool European vibe. Make a reservation just to be sure you get a seat. The staff would check on you constantly and the chef came out to check if everything was to our liking. Everything is made in house including the pasta. This is easily one of my top 5 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Prices are reasonable from 10 to 18 dollars per dish. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So nice to have a good Italian restaurant in the area.  Staff is friendly and the Chef was helping out in the restaurant to make sure things were going well and helping to serve and clear tables at times when he left the kitchen.  We were able to talk with him for a few seconds and he really wants to know what you think.  We found out the everything but the bread is made in house.  Coming soon, Bar LeoGreat in the space next door after renovations that will be connected to the restaurant. We started with the Greens and Beans which were very tasty and cooked perfectly.  Really enjoyed the sausage.  My Linguini Carbonara was very good and a good sized portion.  We split a couple of the homemade deserts, a flourless chocolate cake was superb and the coconut pie was good but the crust was probably a bit to thick for the delicate pie."}
{"text":"What a great little place. My wife and I took my 98 year old Italian mother - the sauce boss!! She can brutal on Italian restaurants.  This meal was very close to being at her house on a Sunday afternoon with the entire family, including Uncles and others who would be around.  As for the other reviews - not understanding the sauce - that is their loss. This is real close to your Italian grandma's sauce ( or in my case my 98 year old mom). Mom even called them over when the meal was done and complimented them. That was a first. Doesn't happen !"}
{"text":"I don't often give five stars, but this place is very good. First it's a scratch kitchen. Absolutely everything is made in house.  The food was done perfectly, service was spot on, and I have zero complaints.  The atmosphere was kinda like a SOHO restaurant. Small interior, with brick accents, and a tasteful decor.   I highly recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and it did not disappoint. The meatballs are amaz-balls.  The Antipasta plate was delicious and the Coconut Cream Pie was great!  We highly recommend it!  They currently don't have a liquor license but they applied for it.  Double check before you BYOB."}
{"text":"LeoGreta is officially open and is serving both lunch and dinner. Takeout is available and I noticed upon entry a reservation book thus concluding they take reservations as well. The theme is Italian/French. The business was opened by chef Greg Alauzen formerly known in some of Pittsburgh's better restaurants.  The place is very clean and the staff warm and friendly. The restaurant is average size and sits about a mile west from the center of Carnegie business district. I decided to order for lunch the veggie sandwich that consisted of roasted portabella mushrooms, peppers, white bean spread, and frisee. They use bread from Mediterra bakery located in Robinson.  All sandwiches come with a side of pickled vegetables. This is probably one of the few vegetarian choices on the menu. There are none for vegans.  I noticed that portion sizes are fairly huge so come hungry. I got my food fairly quickly since the place wasn't overcrowded. My mushrooms were huge in my sandwich. Although I loved the sandwich I had some trouble biting the bread. I later learned after I completed my sandwich that they had given me \"end\" pieces of the loaf and I could have had a choice of a different softer bread. The menu does not list the bread choices so I would have not known this option existed.  When I ordered my ice tea I learned they only serve it sweetened. Unsweetened ice tea is not available so do not be mislead by the menu. My tea was filled completely with an orange wedge attached. I asked for a straw and was told they had none. Later on I learned that they were ordering straws and would have them next time I visit. Right now the place is BYOB, however, they have applied for a liquor license so this will change in the near future.  My waitress asked me if I wanted dessert. I skipped over that in favor of one of those delicious meatballs. They sell for $3.00 but judging by the size one is good enough for me. My waitress brought me a few \"center\" cuts of the same bread I had with my sandwich and it was a lot easier for me to chew. I must say the meatball was worth every penny and I enjoyed that over my sandwich.  The meatball is also available as a combo with pork and house sausage. Prices are reasonable.  I feel this place is a work in progress seeing that it has just opened and still has to get what I call some of the \" bugs\" worked out of it. Menu corrections should be made so that the consumer would know about the two types of bread they serve as well as correction for the ice tea (should be labeled \"sweet tea\"). Also since I didn't order a dessert I have no idea of pricing since desserts are not on their online menu. Still it makes a welcome addition to an up and coming community in Carnegie. There is metered parking along W. Main St but you can obtain free parking if you park along one of the side streets. It sits about a block down from Applelicious where you can also get a sweet treat."}
