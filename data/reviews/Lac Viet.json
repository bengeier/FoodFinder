{"text":"When this place first opened in Beddington, I thought, \"Hey, another place close to my house besides the one I grew up with (Pho Thanh)\". I went there several times and I have to say, it's not that up to par compared to other pho places. The pho sizes are quite average so no complaints there, however, the contents of the pho disappoint me. There was not that much meat compared to other pho places and it was basically 40% vermicelli and 40% soup. In addition, the service is below average. Most of the waitresses seem like they do not want to be there and do not provide comforting and welcoming service although it is friendly service. They also tend to make more mistakes than they can account for. For example, one waitress asked us if we wanted our bean sprouts raw or cooked. I clearly stated we wanted them raw except she comes back with a plate of basil and steaming hot bean sprouts (clearly not raw). In addition, the pho we ate had clumps of beef instead of slices of beef which made it really hard to enjoy the beef slowly as it was all in clumps. Price wise, the appetizers are overpriced so I do not recommend getting them. For there large pho, average price was 10 dollars, however, for the same price, I can get a pho with more contents in the bowl at Pho Thanh (and for a dollar more I can get an X-tra Large pho at Pho Thanh). Overall, not a good go-to place for pho but if I'm out of options then I'll go to this place."}
{"text":"We went here because my fav place was closed this day and had heard some good things about this new place. 
The food wasn't bad - it wasn't great either. There are so many places around here with great Vietnamese that I probably won't make it back here unless it's an emergency pho situation. There was a lack of flavour that's for sure. 
I will say that I was impressed with the decor and cleanliness though. Better decor than most pho places."}
{"text":"When this place first opened the food was great.  The food quality has dropped a lot.  Service is always good though.    I was here a week ago, and ordered pork and shrimp salad rolls.   It was gross and sorely lacking in ingredients.  It wasn't pork, but some sort of processed meat (spam maybe?).  Only lettuce and vermicelli noodles.  No carrots, or other ingredients like they used to put in their salad rolls.  I ordered the vermicelli bowl with beef and shrimp.  Two pieces of shrimp, and you could barely find beef in the bowl.   They are cutting back on ingredients in a big way.  I was hopeful this place would maintain the good quality, but it's dropped a lot and I won't be coming here again.  I'll stick to the place in hunterhorn plaza."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times now, once when it first opened where the food was decent, and then last night.  I ordered the typical white man dish, and an order of pork dumplings.  I found the food average in taste, and an off taste to the spring rolls.  IMO, the best place for Vietnamese is in Hunterhorn... but maybe I shouldn't say this, as then there will be an increase of customers going to my fave Vietnamese restaurant which could result in me and my friends waiting longer for a table, so on second thought... yes, you should eat at Lac Viet."}
{"text":"3rd time here, last time ever. Had a stirfry in nested noodles. Served with over cooked out dated brocolli and cauliflower,  chicken pieces tasted like left overs, the sliced  beef was a boiled mess. This meal was not prepared with fresh ingredients or pride , it was slop fed to the next sucker sitting at the table. The pictures on menu looked delicious...mine didnt.
I wont be back."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by the Beddington area - lots of pubs, a few fast food places, but not much in between.  We almost stopped at an A&W because we needed something quick when D spotted this little vietnamese place.  The idea of eating something quick, fresh, and flavourful was more appealing than the fast food option and we did not have time for a full sitdown pub experience.

We went in and got a seat at a nice little booth in the corner then poured through the menu, settling on a couple of bowls of #41 - Grilled Lemongrass Chicken with Vermicelli and Spring Roll.

I've never had a vermicelli bowl where the noodles were so freshly cooked that they were still warm.  It was perfect!  The salad was fresh with a very light dressing, and the spring rolls were hot and crispy.  The sad part was the chicken - barely grilled, no lemongrass flavour, and not much of it anyway.  Everything else was delicious right down to the fantastic hoisin sauce, but they definitely need to up the lemongrass and put some more chicken in that bowl.

The ratio was 50% noodles (decent and tasty) / 40% salad / 7% spring roll / 3% chicken.

If they can fix the chicken they'd be the best vietnamese place we've tried so far!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant for a number of times now.  The restaurant is very clean.  It also has lots of room so you do not feel claustrophobic as you do in some restaurants that pack people in like sardines.  The servers are friendly and the food is comparable or better than other Vietnamese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"the place is clean and service is mediocre.  they were upset at me for not making fresh food.  the soup was edible,  meat is old and not fresh.   the coke has a funny taste,  too flat, co2 is out maybe.  spring rolls are old and reheated,  i saw them using a microwave almost exclusively.   if i wanted to eat out of a microwave i would have reheated yesterdays leftovers.  the vermichelli and beef sate was cold and old.  everything reheated.  im local too so its dissapointing.  i might give them another chance"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, usually for pickup. I always call ahead and the food is ready by the time I arrive."}
{"text":"I've been hearing rumblings about a new Vietnamese place opening up in the neighbouring hoods. Always on the hunt for a new local place, I couldn't wait to check it out.

Totally delivered. Lovely little space, clean and airy. Lots of parking. And for 1-1:30 pm, quite busy with a revolving door of people coming and going. Word gets out when there is a good thing in the hood.

Three of us shared a couple dishes. Chicken satay with spring rolls, spicy chicken pho and some chicken salad rolls. The kids delighted in their large and in charge mango smoothies which were cleverly served in a to go cup. The smoothies lasted them all day.

Food was simply delicious. Service really good. Lovely people who brought us our food quite quickly I might add. And as I looked around at other tables....almost everyone was having Pho. Must have been a pho kind of day. Plus it was good.

Grabbed a take out menu, know we will be back."}
{"text":"Starving and madly craving Vietnamese food one night, a group of friends and I placed an order from Lac Viet on SkipTheDishes. I have never been to the restaurant, so I can't rate anything but the food. 

I ordered the \"Charbroiled Pork, Shredded Pork and Spring Rolls on Vermicelli\" and added a beef meatball. For just under $10 for the dish, it seems like a bang for your buck, but truthfully, the food was mediocre at best. The beef ball was much more spongey than I've had in the past, the noodles were overcooked and sticking, and the spring rolls were dripping oil. The pork, which was both well-seasoned and not dry, was the only thing that saved the dish. This all happened after we each had a salad roll as an appetizer. The rolls came with no peanut sauce, which is a catastrophe for these totally unseasoned, bland, tasteless rolls. 

I love Vietnamese food, but with so many available options, it's a shame some restaurants don't put more effort into their food and pleasing their customers. I would have rather had them charge five dollars more for a tasty dish. I won't be placing another order with Lac Viet."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Lac Viet and I was pleasantly surprised. The lemon grass chicken was great. Although the menu said \"spicy\" it wasn't - and I was fine with that. I'm a mild salsa girl so this was perfect. The service was fast and it was quite busy with a younger crowd."}
{"text":"Great place. I had the chicken satay pho, really good. Atmosphere is great!! Very clean and tidy, even the bathrooms are spotless. I'll definitely be back here!!"}
{"text":"This is my 'go-to' pho restaurant. Their soup is very fresh and flavourful along with their salad rolls and bubble tea's. I highly recommend this restaurant and I'm so happy that it's within walking distance from my house :)"}
{"text":"Old, flavorless, gray-colored disgusting meat, mixed in with some fresh meat, in the beef soup. See attached photo. Tasted disgusting and old!! Probably the worst meat I've had in a pho.

Ice coffee was not very good either. Will never return to this place!!"}
