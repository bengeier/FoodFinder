{"text":"Damn, I don't want to write about this place because it's so busy already. We waited half an hour for a seat on a snowy day during Big Taste of Calgary. This brewery was packed! 

You seat yourself, order drinks from the bar and food from the kitchen. Despite the self-service, there was always someone around to bus or help you. We had an employee that seem to be the manager/owner help us find a seat. When one became available he came over right away to let us know.

The reason you come here is for the BBQ. Oh my goodness. We feasted like kings for $30. We shared a platter of brisket, chicken (so good) and ribs, with mac and cheese, beans and fries. 

We sampled 8 beers. Once the food hit the table, I stopped noticing how the beer tasted. My mind was solely on devouring these delicious BBQ meats. A sampler of 4 beers was only $7. So cheap. 

Want to forget about our crappy winter and the stupid amounts of snow we are having? Go to Paddy's and taste some summer BBQ."}
{"text":"Fun spot for some brew-bq! This place was packed on Saturday night and for good reason! Great bbq and beer for a fantastic price!! I have to say it's not the best bbq I've had in Calgary but you can't go wrong with a pound of meat and 3 sides for $25 and $5 craft beer! Their bbq sauces were tasty too. My favourite beer was the ISA."}
{"text":"After hearing about Paddy's about a month ago, I have managed to get in there twice now. It's a cool little spot in a mostly industrial area, just off Macleod Trail. There were 5 of us the first visit and we shared the family feast platter. The brisket was good, but not great. The pulled pork was excellent, but for me the turkey was the winner. The best smoked turkey (other than my own maybe) that I've had. Great sides made for a meal enjoyed by all. The beans are outstanding.  

My second visit was with my wife and daughter. We split the half feast platter with brisket, ribs and chicken, with beans Mac & cheese and coleslaw as our sides.  The brisket was excellent this time around. The ribs were very good as well, but Once again the poultry stole the show! Moist and juicy with just the perfect kiss of smoke.   Some great pickles and pickled onion come in the side and you can help yourself to nice thick slices of white bread. 


Paddy's is also a microbrewery with a great selection of brews on tap. My only issue is that the root beer on tap is the only non-alcoholic option other than water. 


It's great to see another bbq option in Calgary doing well. The place was packed on the Saturday evening when we were there."}
{"text":"Paddy's is a neat new brewery in Calgary, the combination of beer and BBQ is delightful. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and there were a few tables of people hanging out enjoying some beers and some food. You order the food at the side counter and the beers at the back, both boys ordered a beer but I wanted to try as many as possible and went with a flight and let them choose the beers. I didn't get to try the stout but would like to on my next visit. The BBQ was delicious, they had a family feast that sounded like so much food and was good for 4-5 people for only $50. We tried the brisket, some smoked wings and a few different sides, everything was very tasty and went well with the beers. They had some great BBQ sauces as well that I assume they make in house? The mago habanero was recommended to us and it was by far my favourite sauce. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!!! Got a half feast, flight of beer and a pint for $40. Great value. No other bbq place like it. Definitely a new favourite!"}
{"text":"I was here last weekend with 2 friends and we all loved it! We shared the feast for $60 and it was plenty of food, brisket, chicken, pork, beans, mac n cheese and fries. Brisket was incredible but the chicken was the star, wow, the flavour was amazing. I wasn't a big fan of the memphis sauce but the carolina sauce was great with the pork. Also had a lager, and a root beer, both very good. 

Calgary has some BBQ, nothing compared to true BBQ in the south, but this place raises the bar. Love it."}
{"text":"Slather me in sauce and call me Sally, I love this place. 

For $15/person, you can feed four people full to the gills (when they have their family combos on) with delicious BBQ. The brisket. THE BRISKET. So tender and delicious. 

And the sides! Kale caeser? Yes please. Mac n' cheese? Delish. Fries? Why not?! Everything is good. Get it all. Stuff your face with it, you cheeky thing, you.

I get a flight most times I go -- some solid brews on tap. Love when they have the Root Beer from Annex in here for the wife; and you can totally bring babies and kids in here.

As a guy about to have a kid, this is a major plus. 

Can't recommend this place enough. But I also recommend you not go there, so that there's room for me to sit with my family and friends while stuffing my face.

Alright, fine. We can share."}
