{"text":"Best hot dogs in the west side of town.  You have to get there early in the night.  (Hotdogs sell out pretty fast) reasonably priced compared to competitors but you get so much more.  All ingredients taste fresh.  The owner whom is also the only employee is friendly and he remembers his customers.    This is not a fast food place, so don't expect to be in and out in less than 5 min. If you want mouthwatering Sonoran Style Hotdogs this is the place to go."}
{"text":"we see this guy set up all the time on 83rd ave and peoria and finally decided that we had beter stop in and see why so many people where sitting at the tables. well it became pretty obvious pretty quick what all the fuss was about, this hot dog cart is like none other!! for just $3.00 you get a bacon wrapped dog nestled nicely into a so fluffy bun that is the topped with an array of ingredients, and he gets it to you in a flash! if you do not stop here and support a wonderful local business i would have to question why?"}
{"text":"El Pechocho's hot dogs are so delicious! I always bring people to this spot because I know they'll love them. I've been coming to him for a couple of years now and he never disappoints. I come so often that he knows my order by heart. 
He's very quick when it comes to preparing hot dogs while he has a line. I personally think this place is better than La Pasadita.
Try this place! I promise you'll love the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Man, these hot dogs are bomb. Really tasty, served with a roasted pepper.. cost-effective at 3 bucks each, warm soft bun - yeah.. all day."}
{"text":"My husband and I are avid fans of Sonoran style hotdogs.  We first had a taste of these types of hotdogs in Tucson and we were hooked.  Lately, I've been checking Yelp to see what's new and hot around our area, and lo and behold, this appeared.

Fellow yelper Sheena M. was kind enough to let me know the hours and where he was located.  Finally, we were able to find this place as it's right to the side of a liquor store (Payless Market).  As fate would have it, it's cash only, which we didn't have.  So this foodie adventure had to be delayed until my husband came back with some cash 10 minutes later.

For $3, you get a deal of a meal.  The hotdog comes with onions, avocado, bacon..you name it!  This comes fully loaded.  The owner is such a great guy and very friendly.  He also sells Mexican sodas and other refreshments.  Seriously one of the best Sonoran style hotdogs I have ever had, period.

You know this place is legit when he has faithful followers that drive over 20 minutes to come to his stand.  I hope he stays in business forever."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place ! Weekly cravings always bring me back . The bread is always soft and warm and all of the toppings are fresh . He is very clean and me and my bf have never gotten sick . I absolutely love these hotdogs lol"}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs. The buns are nice & fluffy & he wraps the weiner in bacon. 
He puts beans in them that are really scrumptious.
The only thing I would advise to those interested in coming here is to make sure you are not overcharged. I have been overcharged twice! Only by a dollar or so, though.
Also, it is really rare to find my favorite soda (Sangria) anywhere let alone find the authentic Mexican bottle. They have those here as well as many other authentic mexican sodas!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food for a long time here. My wife and kids got sick bout 1yr ago and haven't ate there since!! The \"bacon\" smelled like dirty gym sock and was Disgusting to say the least!!! Please be aware that this man may not be the cleanest when it come to preparing his food! Sorry to give a bad review just need to say the truth!!!!!"}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place, its our go to spot on the weekends when I don't want to cook.  The Sonoran hot dogs or delicious and the service is warm and welcoming.  The buns alone are worth the drive, they are soft, light and fluffy.  They compliment the Sonoran dog perfectly. There are soft  drinks and chips and you can get what you want on your Sonoran dog, I like mine with everything!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sonoran dog in the valley!! I've been going to this cart for over 5 years now!!"}
{"text":"Nice guy. Awesome bun, good flavor, will definitely be back. Loved it. Got 3 dogs, soda and chips for 12 bucks!"}
{"text":"My son and I love going to this place for sonoran dogs, his hours are 6pm - 2am I believe but it's best to get there around 6:30 to give him time to setup. There's always a line ready to order by 6:30. $3 a dog isn't bad and I've been to 3 other popular yelp spots and his are the best.

Kind of funny the guy that left a bad review a couple of days ago said he got food poisoning an entire YEAR ago but is now choosing to post about it .

I really wish yelp would give us the option to leave 1/2 stars because this place would be a 3.5 for sure."}
{"text":"These dogs are on point. Ordered 3 the works jalapeno on the side. Dog was fresh bacon was delicious. What did it for me was the bun you can't have a good sonoran dog without a good bun highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have been to many Sonoran Hot dog places & by far this is the BEST....very courteous & friendly will be here many more times"}
