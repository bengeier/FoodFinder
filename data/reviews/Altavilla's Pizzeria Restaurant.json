{"text":"Decided to stay in watch game order pizza the worst pizza ever had soggy  mushrooms not cooked peppers not cooked terrible won't be going back"}
{"text":"Rubbery crust, buried in mozzarella, cheap pepperoni and unfriendly staff, why go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza   and  BYOB including BEER.  They supply glasses and openers.  Inside and outside seating.  Pizza is always good and the place is always crowded so that says something about the food."}
{"text":"5 stars!!!! Finally found a great pizza! And the prices were decent too! FYI: bring your own beer or wine!! Saves $!! Whatta deal! 
Pizza was thin crust, tasty sauce plus lots of cheese! We will definitely be back.... And will bring friends next time!"}
{"text":"Sauce has the right blend of spices and flavor. The crust is light and flaky and with pizza with tasty sausage is perfectly cohesive! Great place for a great pizza!"}
{"text":"Pretty tough to order a pizza when the server is to busy arguing with an employee about something so intently they can't even hear your order and you have to repeat it. I would have left but I was being taken out. 

Anyway. We struggled through despite whatever they were all arguing over and got our two pizzas ordered.  

Mom got a veggie pizza and I got my standard pepperoni and jalape√±o. Moms friend got spaghetti. 

None of it had any flavor.  Neither pizza had enough sauce and the crust was so paper thin it was hardly existent. I like a crispy thin crust but this was too thin. The best part about both pizzas was the cheese. 

Our friend had spaghetti with barely any sauce and her garlic toast was burned. 

Also, I don't like pizza cut into bite size squares like they do here. 

The servers were pretty rough. Chairs drug and slammed around, snide gestures, etc. 

I gave two stars because the cheese in the pizza was good."}
{"text":"The people who own this place are old assholes. Be ready to be treated rudely. They act as if they are doing YOU a favor by selling YOU a pizza!!!
These people buy second rate products downtown and then drive them all the back to SCW in their hot car. They also started using canned mushrooms... YUCK...
If they are so miserable owning a pizza parlor just sell it."}
{"text":"If your hours are posted until 8pm, then when customers come in at 7:20 p.m,. At least try to make them feel like they're not an inconvenience. It was my first time last Friday and probably my last. I had to ask if they were still open and then got my order taken by a scrowling person,midway she turnef and had another lady take over with not s word to me.I sat and waited for my pizza to be ready and listened to the Waitresses groan and moan every time a customer came in. I know how it is to work late and want to go home and put your feet up but if I'm not made to feel welcome I won't go back to a place. There was a large party sitting outside and the waitresses had put away all the other tables and chairs .do you think they felt like they could enjoy their dinner with a server breathing down their necks...very disapointed,won't be back"}
{"text":"We were in Sun City West during a stressful time for our family, and we stopped in at Alta Villa before shopping at Basha's, which shares the parking lot. My son was starving, so I asked if they served slices. In an unnecessarily angry tone, the server told us they only serve whole pizzas. I asked if they had breadsticks, thinking I could get him a little snack anyway to help him make it through the afternoon. She begrudgingly said yes, they did serve breadsticks. I then saw the menu and realized they had garlic cheese bread, so I asked if we could get that instead. She yelled back to the kitchen with disgust, telling the cook to cancel the breadstick order. (It had been about 15 seconds since we ordered.) Then I tried to pay with a credit card (I saw the sign that said 50 cent fee for credit card transactions, but I was more than willing to pay it), and she huffed angrily that she couldn't take a credit card for such a small order. The cook came to the front and asked, also angrily, \"What do they want now?\" We left. I don't care if the food here is good or bad. I would not eat in a place so filled with anger and rudeness."}
{"text":"The white lady in the cash  registered she is races over international people very rude obnoxious food served cold pizza very rubbery Foods nasty"}
{"text":"Didn't get to try this place.  I ordered a personal pizza.  My tab was $5.40 (approx) and the owner said cash only or spend $7.00.  I explained I only brought my debit and he just shrugged.  I wont return!"}
{"text":"I have had good pizza here in the past so I thought I would try their pasta. I ordered pasta with meat sauce. First of all, the server never said there was a $1.00 extra charge for the meat sauce nor did she say there was a .50 cent additional charge for blue cheese on the salad. I questioned the bill but she said the prices were correct. No receipt for me to look at. I got the order to go and when I got home and opened the pasts, there was a layer of sauce on top and underneath was a layer of ground meat sprinkled over the past. The meat wasn't mixed into the sauce and was very bland hamburger meat. Anytime I have ordered meat sauce, the meat is cooked in the sauce. In my opinion, this wasn't meat sauce. After I got home, I looked on the menu and there I found the meat sauce and blue cheese were extra. Fine print and never told up front about the extra charge. Never going again. There are better places in the valley for pasta with REAL meat sauce, not bland hamburger crumbles over pasta with marinara sauce on top."}
{"text":"First time here, the chicken parmigiana sandwich was awesome, the owner is super friendly and the good is great. What else can you all for now a days. This page is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Haven't even got my food and I won't come back. I asked for a to go cup for my drink and the owner almost had a heart attack. What a cheap ass."}
{"text":"Wow....pleasantly surprised!  

Visiting the folks from outta town and we meet a group of their friends here.  

Firstly...no corkage and byob...beer too!

Pizza very very good.  All the dishes looked tasty and everyone was very happy.  Eggplant parm looked especially delic and no doubt that,ll be my next meal when we go back.  And we will go back!"}
