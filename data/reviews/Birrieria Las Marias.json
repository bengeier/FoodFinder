{"text":"We went out looking for a different place, but stopped at this restaurant because the parking lot was full. It was packed with Mexican families, service was good, and the food was delicious. We came from out of town and one of our friends is Mexican, and halfway through the meal she started talking about moving to Arizona. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried las Marias for our first time. We had tacos de birria and carne asada! The service is great and food was authenic and tasty! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Doesn't disappoint  This was my first visit to Birrieria Las Marias for breakfast and it did not disappointed. I had family in town that have a hankering for a centek Mexican food. So after reading a few reviews on Yelp we decided to head out to Birrieria Las Marias.  On this visit we shared chile relleno/eggs, chorizo/eggs, enchiladas, chilaquiles with red sauce, and beans.  The beans are to die for, it was slightly spicy and cheesy, probably some of the best things I've ever had. All our entrees were fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  The prices are reasonable, service is great, and food is delicious. We will definitely back the try other items off the menu."}
{"text":"The location is a bit small but the home specialty is Birria which it taste pretty good.. The one thing I really love was the spicy cheesy beans dip was the bomb I recommend if you feel like eating Birria they also have Tortas,tacos, mariscos, the bad part is that they didn't have rice"}
{"text":"Awesome food one of the best places in the west Phoenix area. Service very nice and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worse food in my opinion. I ordered a basic breakfast and the place served and charged me for slop. Don't waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"We were totally surprised how good the food was.   When they give out their chips they give you a really good tasting bean type dip with them. They have great salsa bar with unique flavored salsas.  One of them is  a very very hot red sauce, I would call a thai 10.  I think they should sell that red hot salsa to Safeway which is in the same shopping complex they are located in. We had enchiladas and tacos as well and both plates were yummy. We will definitely return soon"}
{"text":"So, I still really like this place. I do have one criticism and it's not about the food or service which remains outstanding. But there is one thing and this is a personal pet peeve of mind. It's the TV that all restaurants seem to think is necessary. I don't mind if the sound is off and the closed captioning is on. But here the sound is so loud it is hard to hear the person sitting across the table from you. My advice to the owner is that people do not come to your restaurant to watch TV. They come to enjoy your great food and enjoy the company of those they came with. The blaring sound of the TV makes it difficult to enjoy the food and company I came for. Please, Please, Please, fix this. I'm still keeping the 5 star rating for now."}
