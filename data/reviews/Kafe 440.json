{"text":"I think this place is fantastic.  I live right around the corner from Kafe 440 and this location has had about 6 or 7 restaurants in the past 3-4 years.  I hope Kafe 440 is there to stay.  Breakfast:  I've only had the pancakes and they are very good.  I've brought a number of family and friends and each has thought the breakfast was good.   Lunch:  This is why I give the place 5 stars.  I've had pretty much every sandwich on the menu and everything is fantastic.  I think the pesto chicken sandwich is the best, but I also really like the Cuban.  And any place that has sweet potato fries is ok in my book.  Within the past week, Kafe 440 has changed their hours.  they are only open for breakfast on the weekends, and during the week they have extended their hours until 8p. (11-8p I think)  They said they will have add'l items on the menu for dinner.  I'm hoping dinner is as good as lunch.   Edit to add:  Went in for breakfast this morning and it is now closed down.  There is a sign on the door that the landlord has taken over as of 6/1.  Boo"}
{"text":"Kafe 440 is about 2 weeks old. Went there for the first time today for breakfast / early lunch. Still seems like they're working some kinks out, but this place is promising.  My sis ordered what I think is called Ham Croque Madame (an open-faced sandwich consisting of bread, ham, & cheese, with an egg on top). It was good too! It came with a side of potatoes--of which there weren't very many. But they were tasty. A little underdone for my sis's taste, but I liked the seasoning.  My pop ordered the Blueberry Pancakes with a side of Ham. The pancakes were fluffy, and fell apart nicely with a fork (you should never have to use a knife on properly prepared pancakes). There were plenty of plump blueberries too. The ham was good--kind of a slender slice, but savory.  I had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, and wow, I was impressed! I'm not sure if they actually bake the bread there, but it was very fresh. I think it was a Ciabatta type bread, and they toasted it on the grill or something because it was warm, had a slight crunch to it, and was very delicious. The chicken was all white meat. The pesto was very good! It was a bit oily probably for some people, but I actually liked it better that way because it seeped into the bread and made the whole sandwich flavorful. I would come back for this sandwich alone!  We also ordered coffee, lemonade, and orange juice. My pop said the coffee was better than most stand-alone coffee establishments (and he's a bit of a coffee-snob too). My sis & I both agreed that the lemonade was extremely tart. Eye-popping tart! The sweet/sour ratios may be a bit off on their recipe right now. Tasted fresh though. My OJ also tasted fresh-squeezed. I thought the $3/each asking price for lemonade and orange juice was a bit high, but the rest of the prices seemed about right. At least for the quality of the meal, I had no complaints.  Overall, thumbs up! I like this place. Still seems a little rough around the edges, but if I lived closer I could see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"We went yesterday and were not impressed. I hadn't seen HSP's review, but would pretty much agree. I'm actually a bit upset that I can't give the place zero stars, because when someone walks away from breakfast hungry because the food was inedible, I don't think the place deserves even one star.  I don't think that anybody mentioned this yet, but this is NOT a full service restaurant. One walks in, stands in line and orders at a counter. The menu is painted on the wall behind the soda machine. This is not necessarily a deal killer, but based on the previous Yelp reviews I had expected a sit down and be served kinda place (What can I say? I'm lazy on weekend mornings...)  I ordered the pancake breakfast ( \"2 pancakes, two eggs and choice of applewood bacon, sausage, ham or turkey\" - I got mine with bacon and oatmeal pancakes for $6.99), and my companion ordered the egg white omelet (\"egg white filled with roasted turkey topped with  tomato-avocado salsa w/ 9 grain toast and rosemary potatoes\" - $6.99).  Croque Madame (\"ham, tomato and melted gruyere on sour dough w/ sunny side egg, side of rosemary potato\" -  there's mustard on it too, and it was $7.29) is a favorite breakfast treat of my companion, so we decided to order one and share it. We also asked for coffee and water.  We were handed ceramic mugs for the coffee, but styrofoam cups for the water. The coffee was in urns on a side table near the register with a self-serve soda machine. The only source of water was the 'water' button on the soda machine. The coffee was ok, nothing particularly bad or good of note. The water from the machine smelled like dead fish and was undrinkable.  Breakfast arrived on ceramic plates, but guests must retrieve their own plastic utensils and napkins from the counter. This I don't really understand... If they're going to have to wash the plates and coffee mugs anyway, why not give me real silverware and a water glass???  Everything was lukewarm at best when it arrived. I went straight for the eggs while they were at least a bit warm as I'm not a fan of cold eggs. I had ordered them over easy, and they were either over-cooked or had continued to cook on the plate while it was obviously waiting to be delivered. I also had my half of the Croque Madam, which probably could have been tasty had it not been delivered cold. The pancakes were a bit chewy and rubbery but edible. The \"applewood bacon\" was indistinguishable from bottom shelf, cheap grocery store bacon - thin sliced, soggy, greasy, and cold.  The biggest disappointment was my companion's egg white omelet. It was egg whites folded around sliced turkey sandwich meat. It was slightly undercooked, so the interior was turkey covered in uncooked egg white. The \"tomato-avocado salsa\" consisted of 3 cherry tomatoes sliced in half and about 6, 1/4\" cubes of avacado dropped on top of the omelet, there was nothing \"salsa\" about it. My companion took one bite of the omelet, grimaced, shivered, and didn't touch it again.   The omelet and croque madame were served with fried potatoes which were almost completely without color from cooking. Some were cooked through, and some were raw potato in the middle. I can't confirm it, but the lack of color and inconsistent doneness made me suspect that a microwave was involved.  The best that my companion could say was \"The toast isn't bad\", which is good, because that's all she ate.  Nothing about my experience at Kafe 440 would give me even the slightest inclination to return. The $2.99 breakfast at the Ikea down the street is far superior in quality and value."}
{"text":"I got a 20% off coupon in the mail so decided to try this place with a couple of friends. We eat breakfast out at least twice a week and are always looking to try new indie places. Kafe440 will NOT be on regular rotation.  I was charged $9 for Croque Madame and Coffee. The food was completely bland, egg was plastic and tomato was not ripe. The coffee was most likely the same stuff delivered to every office building and I don't understand why they have to use wasteful plastic knives and forks (they have china for plates and mugs).  This place comes no where near \"Matt's Big Breakfast\" or \"Morning Glory\" at The Farm. It is a shame but unless there is a serious shakeup I give Kafe440 six months before there is a \"for lease\" sign up.  And for those people who claim this is a nice change from IHOP or Denny's my reply is: live a little and try any of the dozen or more excellent non-chain breakfast places in and around Phoenix."}
