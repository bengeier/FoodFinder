{"text":"Being half-Greek, I have to say that this place really isn't that amazing or authentic when it comes to Greek food (but really, what do you expect from a franchise located in Pickering?). There are a few vegetarian options (the typical ones in Greek cuisine) but all of them are quite plain. The tiropita I've had here has varied a lot... sometimes it's dry, sometimes it's way too greasy. The salad is also quite inconsistent, as sometimes it's flavourful while other times it seems like all they put on it for dressing was oil. From what I've seen of the souvlaki it's also quite dry.  Overall, while the food is.. edible.. it's not much better than a Greek fast food place at the mall. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you REALLY want Greek food (and really, there's not many alternatives around Pickering)."}
{"text":"What can you say about a fast-food Greek restaurant, other than it is okay.  It definitely isn't as authentic as some of the pricier Greek restaurants in Toronto, but it is tasty. If you're looking for amazing, great quality food then this isn't the place!  It's good for a quick bite though and it'll definitely crush a craving. I'd come back but probably just for a lunch."}
{"text":"Not so friendly service did not enjoy our food was not authentic Greek and very disappointed will not eat at this restaurant again which is too bad it looks like a nice atmosphere from outside."}
{"text":"From the outside the place looks like it might be good.  The atmosphere inside is nice as well but the food to me tasted no different than packaged Greek food you can get at the grocery store and cook at home in a fly pan.  The fountain pop was watered down too what a horrible way to try and cut costs."}
