{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar with good basic food. Pool table is busy, but just challenge and join in the rotation. Lots of long time customers that are friendly and will welcome your participation."}
{"text":"Love this local hangout. It's like cheers for me. A great end to the night. Setting is booths, tables or hightop bar. Cheap but good drinks, Awesome barkeeps, pool&darts, touch tunes, and something allllways interesting happens. This place you can get silly and have a good time and meet a wide variety of chill people from the area. Always great."}
{"text":"I love Talleys. This is what a neighborhood pub should be like. Good food, great drinks and very reasonable prices. Go see Emily on Saturday or Sunday mornings for an outstanding breakfast."}
{"text":"In all fairness I live a block away, and that convenience does cloud my judgement.  However, C.J. (the owner) is a true gentleman, the food is pretty decent, the drinks are very cheaply priced (kiltlifter is always 3.25 a pint, a Jim Beam Manhattan is 4.00) and the regulars are a bunch of characters.  They strongly encourage regulars too, it is really a family place."}
{"text":"First rate establishment!! Best bar tenders in town, super friendly and cheapest drinks around.  Great bar food too."}
{"text":"If you have time on a Wednesday night and are in the need for some Italian home cooking, Talley's chicken parmesan is comparable to the finest Italian restaurants in Phoenix it's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be our super casual go-to place when we wanted a quick sandwich and a couple drinks.  Haven't been there in about six weeks so maybe the really great bartender is no longer there because the 50 something black haired bartender is definitely not interested in doing his job. Will probably never be back now.  We Sat down and waited ten minutes. Finally walked to the bar where the bartender ignored us while he did a couple shots with a customer.  Totally ignored us.  Walked back to the table grabbed our things and walked out.  Good job guy.  You just lost a good customer."}
{"text":"Good Food and Fun, CJ is always good to talk to and provide great drinks. You can play pool or darts, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Talleys, where it's happy hour EVERY hour.  Cheapest play in town. Totally dead until about 10pm then it'll be packed. Food is all fried, all cheap, not that great. But did I mention it's happy hour EVERY hour?  So who cares about food!"}
{"text":"Tried the new location and lunch....  I was disapointed  in the basic burger...   I like to try a basic burger to test the quality of the sandwich....   I found the the patty to be thin and small, the bun had seeds on top (poor choice) and was not grilled enough to give the appearance and flavor possible.   Pricing was great.....  I believe a customer should leave with the memory that \"Wow that sandwich was super \".......   Don't be afraid to try CJ's, but I feel there is room for improvement....."}
{"text":"Long story short: CJ's Talley's Pub deserves to be highly praised thankfully to its, first of all, awesome bartenders, great, but still cheap drinks, touch tunes and pool and darts! I like their seating options: high-top bar, tables or booths. Visiting this spot is always a breath of a fresh air for me! If I'm in the mood for some adventure, I'd better coming to this pub instead of other local places of such kind! The pub is always overwhelmed with chill people you can get silly with! High score!"}
{"text":"Weird place. Definitely a dive bar. Certainly dive bar customers and decor. The place is tiny with about 50% of the real estate taken over by a pool table.   Why is it so bright!? If you are gonna be a dive bar turn them things down!  With the Swizzle Inn (one of the best dive bars ever) across the street I won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome staff. Great people. In from out of town and made to feel very welcomed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We can debate the \"Dive-bar\" Vs. \"Pub\" on this one, but if your looking for quick bar food and good prices on drinks then this neighborhood bar is it. It's friendly, fun, and a good place to stop of and hang out for a bit on a hot summers day.  Worth a stop if your in the area."}
{"text":"Great local bar, friendly staff. Awesome specials and cool atmosphere. I definitely will return to this watering hole. Cheap drinks!!!! First time there left a positive impression. Attracts a diverse crowd."}
{"text":"We were going to Dicks Hideaway but it was so busy we kept walking and smelled the burgers cookin at CJ's. They have Fat Tire on tap and they make the perfect Crown and Coke. We ordered burgers and it is so simple... what kind of cheeze? and how do you like it cooked? That is what a good burger should be, simple, superbly done and juicy. The onion rings are crispy and the fried mushroom batter is heavenly. If you do the simple things right you have gold and CJ's is golden."}
{"text":"Truly a Cheers kind of place with local regulars and staff who all know your name.  The atmosphere is friendly, the food is great and very reasonably priced, and the beer is cold.  Not many places like this left."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a night with friends and we had a great time. Lucked out, there was a live band too. Had a great app combo and some wings. Every thing is scratch made I'm told. Glad to finally make it in to the new location! Stopped back in the next morning and had breakfast too! Great spot :)"}
{"text":"Great bar food, great drink prices. Owner is johnny-on-the spot available. Bartender is attentive. The place is a bit small, but the booths are comfortable. This is a \"cheers\" like atmosphere, everyone knows your name. Give it a chance."}
{"text":"Great pricing on quality food and drinks. You can find beef jerky and salsa company owners to commercial real estate persons. Also a patio is coming in the future to help out the smoker/drinkers. Great neighborhood Pub with terrific staff and very genuine customers. They even won trophies in Chili Cook Offs with the Phoenix Fire Departments in the last couple years."}
{"text":"Don't go! But let me explain why. My wife and I have been going to this new location fo the last five weeks or so.  It came highly recommended by several of our friends. Tuesday night is Tito's Tuesday and they had ( and I emphasize HAD ) a great meatloaf special. First time we went, we were greeted by CJ, the owner, when we walked in the door. He seated us at a table and immediately took our drink orders. He was exceedingly friendly.He informed us about the specials and took our food order. I ordered a burger and my wife ordered the meatloaf special. The meatloaf dinner came  with three slices of meatloaf and a generous portion of mashed potatoes with gravy over both. My cheeseburger came cooked perfectly with shoestring fries and all the fixings for the burger, lettuce, tomato ,pickles and onion. From this point on it was downhill. I won't bore you with all the weeks in between but I will tell you that tonight was the last straw. The meatloaf dinner my wife ordered this evening looked like a kids meal. One very small slice of meatloaf, a tablespoon of mashed potatoes and five (we counted) thin rounds of zucchini. And everything, and I mean everything was served cold, not warm, cold. When we complained to the waitress about the dinner being cold, it was suggested that maybe she could take it back and have it warmed up, but by this time we were done. I will end this review by saying that I don't have to be acknowledged by anyone when I walk into a restaurant. But being ignored by the owner, given the fact that we had specific complaints, is Inexcusable."}
{"text":"Fun. That's it. It's fun. If you want a small, local hangout with a positive attitude and very fairly priced cocktails, well.... You have found it."}
{"text":"I like CJ's. The booze is cheap, the patrons are friendly, the bartenders don't act like they're doing you a favor selling you a drink. If you're hungry there is a kitchen with cheap and better than average eats. Check it out."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall joint, stopped in for lunch had the club sandwich and chili, it was magnificent. The hot wings are pretty good too. The owner CJ was our server and he was on his game. There was the usual weathered daytime barfly's hanging out at the bar which is good for people watching. The facilities were clean, the prices are good. I like to keep my money local so I will be back. Five Stars!"}
{"text":"The best kept secret of the Bethany home 16 th St intersection. The food is always quality and super inexpensive, the drinks are stiff and well made. The atmosphere could be spruced up but then it wouldn't be cjs anymore. I go often and regularly. The crowd changes at around 9pm and gets younger and more interesting. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"What counts as a \"pub\"? This is just a small dive bar.  Staff was friendly. They don't kick people out right away after 2. You can stick around here. I went to ask for a menu just to see what they offer here. I just wanted a paper take-away menu but she was going to hand me an official menu. Would she have served me food after 2am?! There's just no way...  The pool table is tiny. It's the smallest table I've seen.  The food is not pub food. At least, not any pub food I've ever seen. Most everything is $6 or under. The Friday Fish Fry is $6.50. Saturday Night New York Steak is $10.25.  Tip: Park in the rear. Use the back door."}
{"text":"I have gone in there a few times and had excellent service.  This was at night time during the week, so there weren't that many people in the bar.  I went in with some friends to get food and there was only one bartender.  The whole place was packed and the bartender was the only one working.  I think they need to staff a little bit better because we knew she was only going to give us our pitcher and not return to take our order.  It was not really her fault considering she was the only one working the whole place.  If they had more staff during peak hours, this place would not lose customers who may just need to eat while starting to drink."}
{"text":"Bar very nice and exciting specials we look to see what they have next my wife loves the chicken fried chicken and steam vegetables. I like the bacon burger also chilly burger and lots of drinks to choose from"}
{"text":"Tucked a way in a strip mall on the corner of 12th ST and Glendale you can find CJs Talley. Am I the only one that feels like this spot is a secret? I think that's how they want it. Yelp is pretty secretive, right?   I was vodka'ed and dine at this joint on a Saturday early afternoon after a great workout. Breakfast sounded great as did the occasional day-cocktail. Cheap breakfast.. like $5 cheap. And decent, for sure! Had good laughs over a $5 bloody, and Cape Cod served by fast efficient service.    The place has TVs, a pool table, and I wanna go back on a Friday or Saturday night to check it out!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in The Valley to drink cheap and they serve pretty tasty bar food. The service is always attentive and friendly. This is definitely a local's hangout. and not a bad place at all to hang, but I personally have never (or ever will) make a conscious effort to come here. I usually wind up here because someone I'm with wants to come here so it's usually a stopover point while bar hopping. While I love me a cheap, stiff drink I usually find myself wanting to move on before long."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! My best friend and I were blindly driving around Phoenix in search of a meal and passed by CJ's and decided \"why not?\". We (two 23 year old girls) confidently walked in to the dim sports bar and were greeted by the cutest woman of all time (Emily, I believe) and a bar of clear locals. We explained that we were celebrating my birthday weekend in Phoenix and I was then treated with a free drink. The burger was amazing, the fries are perfectly crispy, and they have Blue Moon on tap so I was a happy camper. We even met CJ, who could not have been nicer, and everyone gave us travel tips. Highly suggest this place for great food and great people!"}
{"text":"New location is in the plaza on south side of Glendale on 13th Street. Really good food at really good prices, and a nice neighborhood bar. No pool table at the new digs yet, fyi."}
{"text":"Talley's fits the bill for some well-poured & cheap drinks, super tasty potato skins, and a decent shot at a pool table. Pretty sure they stop cooking at 10pm."}
{"text":"Been going to C.J's for 20+ years, excellent atmosphere, and for a local bar the \"Food\" is unreal. I've had the Meatloaf, Pork chops, Fish fry, all great. C.J. has worked here for over 20 years, bought it 14 years ago, and its better than ever. Great place for a good time and great meal. By the way, if you like Burgers they will make them anyway you want ! Good times, Great Quality !"}
{"text":"Where else can you get a shot of jack daniels for 3.50 at 10am? I rest my case. Oh and their bar food is really really good."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Very local and neighborhood friendly. They're food is good and cheap and the bartenders are always awesome. Especially Gordon and Toni!"}
{"text":"Very snotty bartender!  I shouldn't have to wait 15 min. For a drink while the bartender is talking at the other end of the bar looked back at me and still kept talking and there was only a few people in there!  Would never go back there and will tell all my friends!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening hoping for fish and chips but they were out so we ordered something else and met CJ.  We sat at the bar in very comfortable stools and I asked if I could buy four as I noticed spares along a wall - no, but he told me where he bought them and the next day I found the place and bought them.  The food was good, drinks strong and friendly patrons.  It is a local Cheers kind of place.  We've been back two more times and saw people we know.  CJ spoke with us each time - fun place."}
{"text":"I highly recommend CJ\"s . I have been searching for good grilled wings after the Old Dirty Drummer on 51 and Shea went south. Finally found them here. CJ said they will grill them so I tried the medium ones. WOW 12 for $6 and change- big, joicie and wonderful. I sure will be back very soon. Oh great burgers and Martinis as well. Good job CJ !"}
{"text":"I love CJ Talley's!  For the cheap drinks, friendly staff, decent food, local crowd, stellar juke box and for a small dive-ish bar, it's clean and well taken care of.  CJ is a great owner who actually mingles with his patrons.  He's a younger duder who loves what he does.  The tacos and chili dogs are very good.  Yes, I said chili dogs.  When you get sick of paying the Vig Uptown's prices, come across the street and you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Talley's is not only one of our neighborhood pubs, it has strangely good bar food.  There is a brand new juke box.  The entire place has been referbished in the last year or so.  They have TV's behind the bar, that super popular golf video game, and a pool table.  It's just the perfect little neighborhood bar.  The owner, CJ is a super nice guy who happens to be a good bartender.  All in all a great place to cab home from."}
{"text":"They say it takes one bad apple and it's true- I've always hated when yelper's only write bad reviews, so I've only wrote one other bad review before this- but I am a local business owner, right across from CJ's and I've been nothing but nice to my clients about his business- I went in tonight, bought a round of $1 shots for the patrons, and then was ridiculed for being a snobby business owner by CJ's regular - she said I looked like I was over 50 (I'm 36) and her boyfriend said I yelled at him 6 months ago for parking at my business- being a business owner, I would never yell at a neighbor's patron about parking, because if you are busy, parking doesn't matter- plus I don't have time to run out and yell at people parking in front of my business:/ I wish I did.... Unless this guy is banned from CJ's I will never recommend nor give my money to CJ's again -"}
{"text":"You could easily drive/walk past this place and dismiss it, but don't!!  CJ runs a fun little drinking establishment that happens to serve great food! Large numbers of regulars occupy the bar. You will see a huge variety of age groups. Great burgers, really love the meatloaf sandwich. They have regular daily specials."}
{"text":"The only downside is the way this bar is set up. It is a very odd set up for a bar. The food is very reasonably priced along with the beers. If I am in the area again I would definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Omg. I love the new location!! Same GREAT food! Same GREAT service!!  Easy parking!!! Opened late !! Yay!!  Welcome to the great neighborhood!!!  Husband had cheeseburger with grilled onions.  I had cheesesteak with skinny fries!  Fantastic!  See you soon!!"}
{"text":"Awesome priced food and drinks ... Love it!!!  Best fish and chips ever! But they only serve the fish and chips on Fridays. Chicken tenders and the chicken sandwich are awesome too :) It has become my fave dive bar to go to with friends or even alone"}
{"text":"Ole Cj Talleys has moved from their original location from back in the day to being right off of glendale and 12th street by Dutch bros. Not sure of the back story on their move.  They have some interesting decorum but do have a public restroom and a pool table. I noticed they do karaoke sometimes during weekdays if you are into that. They have a few tvs usually playing some old head type stuff. An example would be car auctions and golf.   They do have a kitchen but i have yet to order any food from this location. All drafts are 3.75 non-happy-hour. That's a steal! Most places you get lucky to find an IPA for $5 so I'm happy with their budget pricing.  Overall, it's a old head hangout with cheap booze and loaded with characterers. Kind of fun in its own unique way.   4 stars."}
{"text":"The type of dive bar that existed before your favorite little microwinery. If you like places like these, we'd probably be good friends. There's a couple dozen different dinner options for $6-7 bucks each, and while the beef may not be grass-fed or the presentation remotely nice, it's good hangover protection.   You can even make half orders of any appetizer for $3.25 if you're watching your portions. Nifty, right? Restaurants are never that flexible and inexpensive.   The draft beers are scarce, but at least they had Sierra Nevada Torpedo, one of my faves. I'll come back when I'm not trying to get some Untappd badges.   tl;dr It's simple. It's a dive. It's good. Go."}
{"text":"When someone says neighborhood pub, I immediately think of Talley's.  Definitively a step up from other dive bars in the hood, more friendly than the fancier joints, much better than average bar food (good specials) and an owner who not only is a good bartender, but a good guy.  You'll generally see the same regular crowd who knows where to find a well priced and well poured adult beverage.  I never leave CJ's without a smile on my face."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often. The staff is friendly, and the drinks are cheap. In fact, I often tell people that I feel like I leave with more money than I came in with! And it truly is a place where they remember your name.  It isn't much too look at inside, and that's why only the four stars. It does however, have a pool table, dart board, Silver Strike, and a bar top touch screen game. They also serve food, and have daily specials when it comes to that, but I haven't tried anything. I mainly go for the drinks and friendly neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have a store around the corner from CJ's , Poor Little Rich Girl. CJ's has become our favorite lunch spot. The bar food is fabulous and it is so reasonable! There is a sort of Cheers atmosphere in that if you have been in a couple of times you are likely to recognize people the third or fourth time in and feel right at home. It is a laid-back, neghborhood bar and is very popular in the hood! Cheer's, CJ - to a wonderful place have a Tuesday afternoon Jack and Diet Coke!"}
{"text":"I really dig the new location. It's way more comfortable and spacious. The food is really good and there is a large variety. The Dennis wings are to die for. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Love this bar. Gordon is amazing!! I Live in the neighborhood and this is a very friendly cool place to stop for a drink or a meal."}
{"text":"Cj's is quite the hidden gem! I came to visit my dad from out of town and he took me to this local spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat. The food was delish and the drinks were stiff! We had a great time chatting with the bartender who was very friendly and made me feel like I was back home at my local dive bar. If you're looking for a good burger and a beer, Cj's is your spot!"}
{"text":"CJ's is a pretty basic bar with great drink specials and decent food.  The bartenders are very cool people and attentive to needs of patrons, even late in the evening during the busy times.  They have a few games to play as well which is always fun!  A recommended stop, for sure!"}
