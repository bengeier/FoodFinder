{"text":"Excellent food, a wide variety of different pasta, seafood, steaks.  The etouffee was delicious with plenty of sauce to rice ratio.  The chicken alfredo was more than enough for a hungry 7 year old. The finale was the chocolate mouse cake!  The service was excellent thanks to the waitress Melissa!  Great date place with table cloths and cloth napkins and a chilled fork for your salad."}
{"text":"If you live in the pittsburgh area make sure to stop in and eat at Station Brake. The food is always fantastic and Chef Jason is the best there is. The menu has a taste for everyone and their daily features offer an ever changing menu choice. Their soups are the best i have ever tasted and portions are genorouse. If you do eat here make sure to sign the guestbook for exclusive offers and couppns on your birthday and aniversary. This is,my wife and I's favorite place."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food , service, and friendly people always.   Look forward to coming often."}
{"text":"It was awesome. Had dinner here on 08/02/12.  We ordered the veal amaretto and the Filet with the Cajun butter. Both were cooked perfectly and were delicious. The service was also exceptional by our waitress Kim  We definitely will be back and will recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing meal with ample portions, this is the place for you..  The chef outdoes himself each time we eat there.  Two people in our party had the veal and chicken parm, my wife had the banana stuffed peppers and I had the Louisiana.   Last time I was there, I had the ribeye steak with the Bourbon Street cajun butter sauce and it was the best steak I ever had.     They post coupons on their website so look for those and they are in the entertainment book!!   I think they could get more people in there if they maybe put themselves on restaraunt.com to get people in to try it out."}
{"text":"I have passed this place my whole life and have always heard good things. I finally had the pleasure of eating there and it did not disappoint! Nice, relaxed atmosphere, the staff was very friendly and attentive. Both of our dishes were amazing. My filet was cooked to perfection and was as good if not better than ones I've had at upscale restaurants downtown, not to mention the amazing mushrooms that accompanied it.  Highly recommended giving it a try."}
{"text":"Past the old decor, the food is great. The pizza is fresh and yummy. I wish they served breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative 5 I would. Terrible service and even worse food. Basically paid for a bag of flour. When I told the manager he told me \"too bad\" would not recommend to my worst enemy. I would suggest going to Johnny's right down the street. Their food is great."}
{"text":"We went to Station Brake Caf√© on a Friday night with my best friend and her husband.  I don't know much about Wilmerding but my initial thoughts were the town was a little run down as was the restaurant.  It was very confusing.  The waitress was very nice, and from what I recall served our silverware on a silver tray lined with velvet...  So there was an attempt to portray this upscale theme which reflected onto their menu and prices, but was so off the mark it was humorous.    The menu was extensive and the items where overall on the pricy side.  We opted to just get a sandwich since there entrees were in the $30.00 range and up.  I thought to myself if I was going to spend that much on my meal I would eat somewhere else.  I got the Bourbon Steak sandwich, which they claimed was filet mignon, they ask for a spice level, I belief I said 5.  I made it a platter and added a salad and soup.  The soup, a baked potato soup, was indeed indulging and delicious.  I could've stopped there, should have maybe.   The salad was obviously old.  The tomatoes were shriveled and rotten, and my lettuce was wilted. I removed the bad parts and ate what I could.  And although the waitress was very friendly, she wasn't really careful when setting plates and bowls down.  On both my soup and salad her thumb was poking around the surface...    Our sandwiches came out a little while later.  Honestly mine was so spicy I couldn't taste much of it.  Maybe this was my fault but I wish she would have explained the levels a bit, but again I didn't ask so I accept responsibility for that.  The portion was a little on the small side for a $13.00 sandwich, and when you make it a platter add $4.00.  So for almost $20.00 that's what you get here.    This place is definitely different, I would probably go back if asked by my friend, but not by my own decision.  We ended up having a good time and eventually made it into the bar area.  Now I thought the restaurant side needed updating!  Holy cow, they had reupholster chairs in a pink plaid that was rough to sit on and looked like my grandmother's couch in the 70's!  And it was only select chairs that were donning this material.  I guess once the others rip enough they will get this classy makeover too."}
{"text":"A solid 3 to 3.5'er here!   Sometimes a place excels at serving good basic chow.  Their description says they went from fussy service  and  pricey extras to offering fantastic food at very affordable prices with good service.   Rick and I had heard good things about this place, Because we went to Monroeville Mall to get some last minute items for our upcoming trip, we decided to stop here.  Even though I'm a non-drinker, I noticed the surprisingly large wine and beer list.  Not only is the list extensive, but their booze prices are pretty reasonable.  Rick opted for the 16oz Yeungling and said he hadn't seen beer prices like that since he was in college.  Uh, Sweetheart, it's only been 11 years since you graduated!     So how's the chow?  As I mentioned, we're talking good cheap eats here.  My blackened chicken sandwich was tasty and not at all dry like at some other places.  I topped mine of with a hunk of pepperjack cheese.  For a couple of extra bucks, I made mine a platter with tossed salad and fries.  Rick went for the jumbo ravioli, which although not what you'd get at Davio, was still pretty tasty.    I give Station Brake credit for offering \"Recession Buster\" (my term, not theirs) coupons.  If we were both in the mood for larger dinners, we could have opted for the Personal Potpourri, which includes any four items for $23.99 http://www.stationbrakecafe.com/showcoupon.php?id=58 or if I was a drinker, we could have gone for $5.00 off a bottle of wine http://www.stationbrakecafe.com/showcoupon.php?id=57  This is one of those places where, if you're in the area and in the mood for a good no-nonesense meal, you should give it a try.  Don't let the exterior of the place fool you.  It looks like a converted ex-Wendy's what with the curved solarium glass and red brick."}
{"text":"The Valley's hidden Gem!  Don't be afraid of the Station Brake cafe because it's know as \"fancy\". Those days are long over. Though the same high end yum is being served by Chef Tony, the service has been scaled back. When I used to work there, yes the jedi was a server at this fine establishment. It was table side salads, lemon sorbet, chilled salad forks, and tuxedos. I understand the switch to a more causal style, not to many people get into to the fancy dining. But that is what I miss about this place, a dinning experience!   Though Chef Tony does still do daily chef features that are constantly changing, and are all delicious, they no longer really do the things that made this place great. Table Side ceasar salad, table side HOT spinach salad, and flaming desserts are a thing of the past, along with my favorite \"wild\" game appetizers. I understand that the worls has changed and no longer wants to go to dinner to dine for 2 hours, but we all should.  Stop down and support a great chef, Tony Ceresa! He has taught me alot!  Jedi Recommendations;   * Veal Atlantis * Blackend Ribeye (#3) * Veal Baltimore * Great Lobster Tails * Cajun Filet Sandwich * Champagne Array (stuffed mushrooms)  jedi certified"}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon offer, and I must say it was one of the better ones I've had. While not full-out classy and elite, this place can still be rather pricey depending on what you order (especially if you add on appetizers or desserts), and so I may not come here too often. But if you're into fancy standard-fare American food, this is definitely a good option.  We had the filet mignon, which was extremely tender and juicy, and the parmesan veal, of which there was a lot (it was also good, veal meat has a texture that is hard to describe). Throw in the salad and the soup (chowder, very creamy), one per entree, plus the bread in the beginning, and we were completely done without any room for dessert. We also got no separate appetizer to begin with. So do try to come in a group if possible, as portions are large.  The ambiance is nice, especially around holiday season, and it was not full at all. There is also a bar on the other side, so maybe it gets more lively at other times of the year? Regardless, it was a good decision to come here."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, my husband, bff and her husband, and I came here for the first time. My husband had the Seafood Estouffe, which was lobster, shrimp, scallops and veggies over steamed rice. He also got the loaded baked potato soup and zucchini fritters for his two sides. The portion was big and he said it was delicious. I tasted the soup, and agreed it was good. Our friends got a burger and a steak sandwich with sides, and both said their food was good, too. I had the Salmon Picatta with lemon capers in sauce. I chose a side salad with balsamic dressing and the zucchini fritters for my two sides. The salad was nice - mixed greens, decent amount of veggies and the dressing was surprisingly delicious. I thought that the fritters were okay but super filling - more breading than actual zucchini. My only real issue was with the salmon, which came on a plate by itself, and was completely covered in this sweet sauce and capers. The capers were fine, but the sauce was way too much and overpowering. I ended up asking our waitress for a separate plate, so I could scrap the sauce off and eat the salmon by itself. I can't say that it was bad, it just wasn't for me.  Other than that, our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. The prices are a little high for the quality, quantity, and the general area. However, they do have several coupons on their website that you can take advantage of. We found a coupon online for $15 off, if you order 2 entrees totaling $45 or more. Note: they only let you use one coupon per table, even if you're paying separately. Sort of a bummer.  The other odd thing about this place is the restaurant is intended to be \"upscale\", but the dining room is a little dated. (It could definitely use a remodel.) We went on a Friday night, and there was karaoke going on in the bar area, and it was extremely loud, even from in the dining room. After diner, we did hit up the bar for a little bit, where the karaoke was, of course, even louder. There must have been a lot of regulars singing, because they were all really good and most sang several times. I didn't mind listening to them at all! They also have a pool table, but only the one. I'm wasn't opposed to sitting in the dining room or the bar, but it was just a really strange combination for me - the juxtaposition of the low-key formal dining area then to the loud bar. It was just a little weird.   All things considering, I wouldn't mind a second trip but would probably just opt for a burger, a beer, and some onion rings."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! In Wilmerding? The food is extremely well prepared and the portions are big, justifying the price. Service is excellent. If you can find a coupon, even better!"}
{"text":"Hmm what to say about station brake, nothing too great about this place. The inside of the restaurant has a kind of old feel to it, like motels who update their lobby carpet but leave the guest floors looking like they are in the 70's. that's the vibe i got from this place. Once again i was grouponing and figured for the deal they were giving this place would be decent.   When you first walk in, there is a bar to you left with seating all around it but the place was absolutely deserted as far as i could tell. Straight ahead was additional seating inside the restaurant where there was no natural light nor were any lights turned on. That left us to sit to the right where they had an wall window allowing outdoor light to shine in and brighten the place. the view wasn't appetizing though considering there was a dollar general across the street, not to mention the window was foggy with water and overgrown bushes blocking the view of the street. Next door was a small mini mart with kids running in and out.   The waitress was very kind and attentive. She made suggestions about the various items listed on their menu and they did have several selections of pastas, fish, meats and salad. I ordered a fettuccine Alfredo that came with a soup or side salad; i chose soup. My hubby order some kind of fish with red pepper spices and a salad. After sampling our soup and salad neither of us were impressed and actually switched dishes. I very much enjoyed the salad because the ranch dressing was decent and likewise he preferred the soup. Once our dishes arrived they were hot and appeared delicious. My Alfredo was just OK, it lacked that powerful cheesy flavor but was very creamy enough for dipping my dinner roll in afterwards. I didn't try the fish but he said it tasted good so i just took his word for it. The portions of food they offered were large so the price did fit the portions. I was able to take home leftovers for my family.  Maybe with a little updated scenery inside this place and well groomed hedges this place could have a promising future. Considering its in a mid-low class environment with not not much to look at, I'm not to sure how well their business will do. Good luck Station Brake!!"}
{"text":"The prices were good. The food just ok. The service was slow and not good. There are other Restaurants in the area I will go to next time"}
