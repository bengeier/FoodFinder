{"text":"Poor service. Had to wait about 15 min with no service so I left (didn't have any wait staff approach me at my table). Can't comment on the food though..."}
{"text":"Ugh! So disappointed! First I was told that they gave our table away(I made reservations), I am not sure why they even brought this up because there were lots of empty tables. Then I was seated without menus. Then I was questioned by the waitress as to why I was sitting at the table because I didn't have any menus. Certainly a hostess would not have seated me without menus I was told. Service was slow despite the place not being very busy. Our food came out before our appetizer which took way too long. When we told them we wanted our appetizer first the food runner just sat our food on an empty table behind us with people walking by it. Ultimately they took the appetizer off our bill although it showed up on the initial bill and had to be corrected. The main courses were just okay. I had a burger which was decent. The nachos appetizer was decent as well. I wouldn't go back nor would I recommend anyone else go."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  I hope it closes and a good bar/restaurant goes in.  Please stop eating/drinking at this establishment."}
{"text":"Have stopped here a few times for a bite before the Pens game.  I don't know.  This place seems to be declining in quality.  The service is great but the ingredients they've used the past few visits ... Not so much.  My wife and I both had salads.  The chicken and shrimp were ok, but the lettuce was a little old looming and the tomatoes?  No comment.  This place is ok for the pre game libations but I probably not plan a dinner here.  It's quick and convenient, but lacks a little in quality."}
{"text":"Two stars and well deserved. The food is straight from the freezer to the fryer to the plate. Everything here is obviously prepared or processed offsite, assembled or heated up in the kitchen and sent out.   The front house staff is efficient and friendly. The product they are asked to serve is poor."}
{"text":"I have been through many name changes for this restaurant this location was previously the Euro Cafe and then Damon's and now Pittsburgh Grille.  That's a lot to keep track of no matter what the name one thing is for sure the bartenders are great.  The price for beer is very reasonable and the bar is very spacious and has floor to ceiling widows on both sides which makes it very open and nice.   It's just okay because it's a sports bar and the food is expensive.  It's a nice place to have a couple of cold ones but not much else."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place.  I have had lunch here a few times and it is always a positive experience. The wait staff are always friendly and courteous.  The food is probably just ok but the wait staff make up for it.    The food is typical American bar food.  Not hard to mess up.  The restaurant is also very good for large parties.  There is plenty of room and they have the ability to move tables around to accommodate.  I also thought the service was very speedy, allowing for a quick sit down lunch.  I would suggest this place for lunch hands down."}
{"text":"Wife was told over the phone they had gluten free options. The items the guy mentions couldn't be found. Wait staff had no idea and we're quite rude.  One guest had to wait extra long for her good then asked for mayo. It was slammed on the table in a huff.  Bad day in dodge I guess."}
{"text":"Yikes! This is my first and last time here. It's obvious that no one has put a dime into this esstablishment in years. Everything down to the chairs and bar counter are old and worn.   I can't comment on the food, but the bar selection seems decent although I'm sipping on an awful pinot noir at the moment.  I will not be returning.  1 star for cost 1 star for being located in the Steel Building"}
{"text":"After eating here tonight before an event at the Consol, I can say I am not even slightly surprised by the 2.5 star rating. It really was just overall bad experience. The only thing that got me there was a gift card and the only thing that kept me going was knowing Garth Brooks was waiting for me!   The atmosphere and decor is fine, nothing special. By dirty. Located in the US steel tower and open M-F. The menu is limited during events with a special \"Event menu\" which I really have not seen anywhere else.   The food was mediocre at best. My Cobb salad was just a salad with a very dry piece of chicken on top - definitely don't recommend it. Watery dressing. The nachos app wasn't terrible but it unfortunately arrived after out meals making it not much of an appetizer. They also don't have drink menu to look at.   Fortunately, they did comp the nachos but gave us a hard time about the gift card we had since it was only a piece of card stock with some managers signature on it.  Don't eat here unless you have to, it's just not good. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Note: I was correct to assume that they are affiliated with the North Shore's  Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar. But are they affiliated with Castle Shannon's Pittsburgh Sports Bar & Grill? More answers, more questions...  I pass this place regularly en route home from work, and one day last week, Kay wasn't home to cook. After hearing scuttlebutt that the menu had changed along with management since I last dropped by nearly a year ago, I decided to give PG a second chance.   Well, the service was great, my green (it was her 2nd day on the job) waitress coming off as amicable and on the ball during my entire meal. Eh, but that food still needs some work.  My Po Boy Sandwich was centered around what was essentially a crab/shrimp patty that was edible enough, I suppose. I've had worse. The pretzel bun was a nice touch, but despite what the menu said, there was no remoulade on the sandwich when it was brought to my table.   \"Oh, the cook didn't know.\" my apologetic server said.   Thankfully, she brought me some of that sauce out along with lettuce, onion, tomato, and dill pickle chips.   The fries weren't a bust either and had on them some sort of breading or batter that elevated them slightly above run-of-the-mill.   Dessert for me was called a \"Pecan Ball,\" despite walnuts encrusting the globe of golden vanilla ice cream. I had to send it back since it had no whipped cream nor any other toppings on it, but like the pile of fries, it was acceptably tasty and little more.   So, it turns out that things haven't changed that much after all. I'm wondering when PG will become something else. Then again, the house was half-full on a stormy weeknight. It must be the booze."}
{"text":"This establishment leaves A LOT to be desired. Table service is extremely poor. Visited on 8/23/13 for a retirement party in the back room where 1 server was assigned to handle the entire room (30+ people) while her apparent sidekick was wiping down televisions. Waited 30 minutes for a drink order from the bar and 45 minutes for mediocre, COLD food. If you are drinking alcoholic beverages, you are far better off getting up and going to the bar yourself. I didn't bother complaining because I simply didn't have the time after waiting so long - and if I did, I didn't feel like waiting for a manager when they probably could care less. This place has great potential, but unfortunately it's a waste -- which is a sign of poor management decisions. Just shut the doors now and save yourselves the trouble. So many better choices downtown than this toilet."}
