{"text":"This used to be called Real Bagel and they've done a fabulous job at revamping the store and the selection. Friendly service. Unfortunate that they've just been fined $1500 for uncleanliness/vermin by the city of Montreal which is a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from my apartment, so I go pretty often. 

I know this is CRAZY, but I actually have yet to try the bagels! Their knishes are AMAZING. Seriously, amazing. They have so many: mushroom, potato, spinach, beef, chicken... They are all amazing and well priced, and they heat them up for you. I have also tried a few of the soups, which were very yummy. 

I love this place because they have so many different things. The salad selection is extensive, they have sandwiches, bagels, the knishes I have discussed above, and pretty good coffee too. 

I will try a bagel next time but I just can't resist those knishes. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Great selection of food items at a affordable prices.Lots of vegan and vegetarian options-not like the run of the mill vegan/veg options either. This is definitely a deli.
They even have vita mix blenders that will blend you a refreshing smoothie ice cold.
The salad raw foods section could be better with sugar free salad dressings-they also need to list the ingredients for people with allergies etc.
The background music was obnoxious-the radio.
If your health conscious or not then you will love this place. Bathrooms are clean and have hooks."}
{"text":"This place was great! We ordered a jumbo bagel (sesame/poppy) with lox which was piled high with lox, capers, onion, tomato and a bit of cream cheese. The other bagel we ordered was an onion bagel with egg salad, lettuce, swiss cheese and tomato. Both were very good but the lox bagel was the better of the two. 

We also got a spinach twist and feta twist which are well worth the (.75 cents)! 

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars (not 5) is because they have a strange ordering system. When we ordered, we tried to order 2 bagels at once and they seemed confused. So, they took one order and then another employee came to ask us for the second bagel order while we stood at the counter. It just seems like it would be easier to make it all at once and order from one employee. No worries though, it was all good."}
{"text":"BEST BAGELS EVER!! And I say that after having eaten Fairmont Bagels. 
They are all boiled, then baked in a wood fired oven.
The poppy seed bagels there are beyond wonderful. Just perfectly dense, chewy with only a hint of sweetness! I wish I had more room in my suitcase to bring back a few dozen of them back to Vancouver."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had recommended this place to me. I had gone today with my friend  to try their bagels for breakfast. The place was occupied with customers on a Sunday morning at 9 am with -3 degree wind blowing on your face. Their menu options for the breakfast was great . They make their bagels fresh with a coal fired oven. You buy any stuff for breakfast , the coffee is free, well that's what the lady at the counter had said to me . You order your breakfast and pay at the other counter and tuck into your food. The food was great for the prices . I ordered a breakfast wrap, blueberry turnover , egg roll and bagel with herbs. The food was delicious . My advice for the fellow yelpers, if you are in downtown or near Westmount or feeling a pinch on your wallet , do check out this place, you will love it ."}
{"text":"Fantastic little bakery with an amazing selection of vegetarian and vegan offerings, including a hot bar and take out options.

Some of their pastries are unusual, stuffed bagels for example, but I haven't encountered anything on the menu that wasn't totally tasty thus far!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  My only regret is that I did not buy a dozen everything bagels to bring home with me.  I had an everything with cream cheese on site.  And I took home a jalapeño cheddar (spicy), sesame pumpernickel (solid), coconut white chocolate (exotic), and pretzel bagel (delicious)."}
{"text":"Their bagel variety is pretty good, I did not know a spicy bagel could be this good.

The name is a bit misleading as an outsider like me would avoid this place if I was just looking for a quick bite or ready made meals, not knowing they offer more than bagels.

Some standouts are their chicken salads (6-7 types) and ethnic foods from all types (quesadillas, empanadas, indian samosas)."}
{"text":"Tried the everything bagel with salmon, capers, tomatoes, and onions. So perfect! 
Also got a chicken empanada which was tasty as well
They have loads of juices, smoothies, espresso, coffee, and even the nespresso machine.  I tried a nespresso and it was great too
Highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Can't speak the the bagels, but can speak to the salad bar options and selection of GF items they now carry. 

Salad bar: awesome range of options and don't let your eyes fool you with the container sizes. A quick small serving of chicken sesame salad was more than enough for a quick bite of lunch. 

GF items: They carry a range of packaged options, which is nice to see as really this place is designed for gluten-lovers. So having some other options is welcome by those (ahem, me) who can't indulge. The WOW baking company cookies are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Bagels on Greene is a great little local lunch place in Westmount.  They have a little bit of everything, Indian buffet, pastries, bagel sandwiches, soups, salad bar and pre-made salads, even a smoothie bar.  Also frozen food to go and lots of snack options if you want to pick something up.  My personal favorite is the Indian food hot bar, it's good value for the price (by weight) and very fresh and tasty.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is a one stop shop!

First off didn't know they had a Indian Buffett as soon as you walk in smells amazing In there. You can buy it pre packaged or eat right there and there.

You have all the breads in the back with bagels and the corner has stuffed bagels with cheese and Danishes and all kinds of yummy desserts.

The middle fridge is all the salads they have about 20 different ones to choose from. (Beets and goat cheese and pine nuts or just a beat) chicken salads with cranberry and almonds and even a delicious broccoli one with cheese and a white sauce for it. They have small medium and large containers which is helpful and little tasters out to sample.

Bagels are super fresh so eat them as soon as you get in. (They sell
Cream cheese there) so you don't gotta make a second stop.

This place has a nice little section to sit but I would recommend taking it to go because it's big portions lol.

I will
Forsure be back 

-UPDATE- friend ate left overs of my chicken sandwich a day later and was extremely sick :( I don't know how long they have had the salad out for or made but I haven't returned do to that"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went here for the first time a few days ago and couldn't believe how great the food is. When you first walk in there are two rows consisting of salads and a hot vegetarian bar. They had vegan and vegetarian Indian dishes that were to die for. I tried the butter chicken and the chicken strips. Both dishes prepared with seitan instead of real chicken. As a vegan enthusiast who's tried a number of fake meats, Bagels on Greene makes the absolute best. Their chicken actually tastes better than real chicken. The sauces are incredibly delicious. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I love cheese Danish! It's my favorite thing to buy at this eclectic \"deli/bakery/cafe\". That being said, I'm pretty picky about them. This place has these cherry cheese Danish that are AMAZING, bit strangely, they are not called \"Danish\" here. They call them cherry cheese \"bagels\", but don't let the name fool you, these horse-shoe shaped pastries of cherry cheese deliciousness are definitely classic cheese Danish!

So, as I mentioned above before, this is a bit of an eclectic place. Aside from the usual assortment of baked goods, sandwiches, coffee and bottled beverages this place has an ENORMOUS selection of Vegetarian and Vegan foods. They have a hot and cold \"salad bar\" style buffet which is priced by weight which includes several Indian style favorites such as Butter Chicken, only, made with vegetarian mock chicken. They also have a Mexican food station with Mexican fare and sandwiches with both the standard tuna/chicken/egg salad, cold cuts, etc... as well as VEGETARIAN versions of many of these, including a very good mock-chicken salad.

The place is a little low on atmosphere, probably better as a take-out place than dine in (although there is ample table space inside). Walking by you would never tell this was the Mecca of \"mixed\" dining (catering simultaneously to omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans), but this place definitely fits the bill!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing All-dressed bagel with lox and cream cheese. Very friendly staff and free wifi! I wish there was something like this place in my neighborhood in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"A very nice place to have lunch - lots of seating and a lot of variety to eat.  My kids love the Indian food buffet section (you pay by weight of the plate).  They also serve many different made to order bagel sandwiches (hence the name). There is a smoothie bar and coffee bar.  It is a good place to bring children."}
{"text":"AMAZING.

Best bagels and lox I've ever had (I have to be careful saying that, my mother grew up in New York...) - lots of capers and delicious smoked salmon. My wife loved her bagel and cream cheese. We also rather enjoyed our mango lassi smoothie; the cilantro one was okay. We felt a bit disappointed by the Papillon/Butterfly pastries. The bagel stuffed with cheese and topped with sugar wasn't too bad, but it was perplexing... maybe the texture confused us.

A couple things: One, this is the only place I went to in Montreal where English seemed to be the primary language (we were first addressed in English, the staff spoke to each other in English...don't worry, Francophones, they spoke to customers in both.)
Two, the place looks like a bagel shop (expected) with lots of deli-style sandwiches and salads (expected), but also has a lot of Indian food (not expected, but a pleasant surprise!). If I go back, I'll make sure to try it out and grab some of the many pickles and chutneys on the salad bar.

Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly, and the bagels are the star. I would recommend this place for a good breakfast, lunch, or snack during your time in Montreal."}
{"text":"I go here almost everyday, I've noticed that their veggie pre wrapped sandwiches are often old. I had one that tasted rotten and the bread is often dry. Other than that, the Indian food they bring out for lunch takes my breath away. Their kombuchas and drinks are often months old too.. Check the dates before you buy anything.."}
{"text":"This place is a very unusual dining experience - they have different stations serving different food. There's a Mexican menu, Indian menu, breakfast menu, smoothie section, coffee section, salad bar - the list goes on. The service wasn't great and the lofty counters behind which the employees serve make it difficult for customers to get their attention. The decor is appalling and the tables were dirty and trash was littered on the floor. 

I tried the Indian menu; tip: grab a Thali and get what you like and then the cashier weighs it for a price. The dishes were okay (I hated the Aloo Paratha but the veggie and chicken dishes weren't bad) - my hunt for good, authentic Indian food in Montreal continues."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place starving after a quick hike last week. Was overwhelmed by and confused by how many choices there are! From heaped salad bowls and bagels, to Indian food, chances are you'll find something tasty to eat. We found it overpriced (3 salads for $12) because they weren't generous with their portions. We also got a (small) spicy tuna sandwich on challah bread for $6. A little overpriced and not the best customer service but great flavours and would go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding variety of veg & vegan food!!

Faux meats, south asian & latin flavours/dishes, vegan baked goods, to-go or to-stay...lots to choose from. Everything I have had has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here so I ought to write a review. I live pretty close so no more trips to get montreal bagels!
Sesame bagel with cream cheese: everything you'd expect from a montreal bagel, with generous amounts of cream creese
Thali: Choice of rice, 2 sides, naan and a snack. Great price and delicious! Small size was enough to make me full and satisfied :)
Even though it's a bar-style cafe, I didn't know how to order so someone came out and explained every item + put my meal together. Super thoughtful!
Five stars because you can find pretty much everything here no jokes."}
{"text":"Summary: 
A great bagel place and cafe with a wide variety of quality food. A bit on the expensive side but not horribly so. It's a great place to stop and get a snack or a meal, or grab bagels and other food to go. 

Detailed: 
Bagels on Greene is that, but also a lot more. They have sandwiches, wraps, breakfast, Indian and Mexican options, smoothies, Jewish staples, salads, and soup all available while you're there. They also have plenty of things available as take-away options to complement later meals. The location itself is nice and relatively tidy, though can feel quite crowded during busier times given how much is offered relatively in their space. 

It's a bit on the expensive side, though not to the point where you feel like you checked going to this place off your list and it's probably too much for you to come back regularly (it's Westmount, so not unexpected). 

The only critique is that sometimes the staff is rushed to make your food and doesn't quite get your order right. For example, during my most recent visit I ordered the smoked meat sandwich on a sesame bagel with mustard, cheese, and tomatoes. I got without cheese and tomatoes but with lettuce (as pictured - still great though!). It's not the first time something like this has happened (in my five or so visits) so don't be afraid to casually check your food if you're eating there!

I would definitely go back, great food and variety of options."}
{"text":"Cheese bagels, cheese bagels, cheese bagels. What I love about this place is they make alot of the items they sell fresh on the spot....including the cheese bagels which are without a doubt the best in the city or even that I've ever had. Always a nice consistent size packed with cheese with flavors such as chocolate, plain or strawberry. They have an excellent assortment of freshly prepared salads and sandwiches and if you like Indian food they have great options both fresh and frozen. They are also the only place I've ever see with a coconut bagel and it's AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  One of my Favorites in Montreal.  I'm vegan so it's a treat having a vegan buffet.  Love the faux chicken dishes among others.  The food is exceptionally delicious and flavorful.  I love how casual it is. . And considering how expensive food is in Montreal, it's not bad."}
{"text":"Endroit charmant dans Westmount qui vaut vraiment la peine pour les bagels! Pleins de sortes inusités et différentes garnitures proposées qui diffèrent du traditionnel fromage à la crème ! 

Ils offrent aussi divers repas dîner telles que des sandwiches et des salades ! 

Un bel endroit à arrêter lorsque vous voulez faire changement du Tim Hortons et y aller plus en qualité !"}
{"text":"Awesome place with awesome people! My friend and I were in town from Vermont and staggered in with pangs of hunger for lox bagels.... we were not disappointed!  Best lox bagel that I've ever had and Aruna gave my friend a great start to her bday weekend! Highly recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"I came here twice over the last few years to grab a bagel to eat before heading off to a client. They were good and we'll prepared. I would have given a solid 4 stars but I found on both visits the service to be blunt with some attitude that left me the feeling that my patronage wasn't appreciated. 

Price tag was decent and as other Yelpers stated, they have many things available... it's a good place but I'm docking get a star due to service I received.

Ymmv"}
{"text":"Is this real life? Is this heaven? I can imagine a stoner walking into this place and weeping for joy... it's like they took every food idea ever and brought them all together under one roof and then mixed them together to make even more ideas. My only problem with this place is that I felt guilty for not buying/indulging more. 

In the words of Queen Victoria: \"I want it all. I want it all. I want it all. And I want it now.\""}
{"text":"Yum, loved the food here.  Try the green smoothies with avocado and cilantro!"}
{"text":"After being disappointed by another popular bagel spot in Montreal - this place definitely salvaged the reputation of great montreal bagels. Great tasting and selection of bagels and desserts that were quite delicious, such as the chocolate croissant, cheese bagel, and turn overs."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's reasonably priced, amazing Indian food-- and food in general, and I love that there's so many vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Looks more like a cafeteria and a self service salade than a bagel place .. Smelling of strong curry just walking in.
1,99$/100gr buffet ... Many choices of everything .. Its up to you pay a west island price for a common cafeteria :)"}
