{"text":"Great food, not pricey, definitely worth it for value. Love the jerk chicken and chowmein here ! A star off because the taste isn't always consistent. Overall great most of the time."}
{"text":"One of the best Carribean places I've ever tried! HUGE plate of \"boneless curried chicken roti\" $6.00 Amazing Ox tail! King Fish, Jerk chicken..etc.. If you love carribean food, try Carribean Cuisine, you won't be dissapointed! Located inside Yorkgate mall near Finch & 400."}
{"text":"what the bumba!!!  I deliberately went to yorkgate mall to see what the fuss was about this food court spot and I really wish I would have passed on this one.   First impressions: Waiting in line after a family, I look up and see a cockroach running along the ceiling right over the food. I alert the staff (in my heart I want to scream like a girl & run away as far as possible). Staff member (I think the chef) says he \"can't see it, its gone back in hiding.\" Cockroach drops and lands right on top of the glass covering the food. OK now I'm having a mini heart attack \"get it get it\".  In response to this nastiness,  the chef says \"it's not our fault, it's the building.\" Well, honey u need to pack your bags & relocate then cuz I'm not too keen on cockroaches in my rice & peas, 'nawmean'!!   Looking carefully at the food, the jerk chicken looks dry, the curry potato is a green goblin mush I wouldn't feed to a dog, and it's clear that everything is cold.  Isn't that a health hazard? You're supposed to keep the food warm! So I order (reluctantly) the 2 meat combo - the jerk chicken & the stew beef- and I ask politely, \"is it cold?\" Chef says, \"yes its cold, but I will heat it in the microwave.\" Oh goody.   I suddenly remember the yelp comments about how good their patties are and I order the last two for me and my friend. Chef gives us both, then looks at my friend & says \"Im not gonna charge u for the one patty because it's pretty stale.\" umm okay? why even sell it then? A restaurant (in the food court or not) should pride itself on its food so why send out anything that's below your own standards of sellable food items?   They don't offer coleslaw or salad so he asked if I wanted steamed veggies. Looked at the wilted mess of steamed cabbage and carrots, and said \"naw I'm good\" lol.  He fills the plate up with more rice. Greattt.   So the whole ordering process was really discouraging. The food tasted okay but I couldn't get my mind off the cockroach, the stale patty and the highly unprofessional way they conducted their business. Like, really, u should keep your food warm otherwise u might not pass your health inspection... and i wouldn't be surprised if they've had a \"conditional pass\"  or \"fail\" in the past.  Never going back and do not recommend at all.   Yorkgate food court is now back on my \"I would never\"  list... I should have trusted my gut instincts and not ventured into the darkness! zero/5!!!"}
