{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday around 11am after a trip to Freedom Park and had a lovely experience here- such cool ambiance and the staff was friendly and helpful. Chicken salad was good. The homemade pita chips were ok...a little thick for me. Others in our group enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Just off the beach on our bikes in Sea Pines (Hilton Head Island) and enjoyed our first MayoBird chicken salad sandwiches. Fantastic! Fresh & fast - loved it. (Great grilled cheese on super-fresh bread for my daughter too) thanks!"}
{"text":"Great variety of sandwiches and prepared fresh.  My favorite Mayobird same hunches  included The Heater (roasted jalape√±os), The Buffalo (wing sauce), The Greek (Greek yogurt, feta, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes & olives).  All have great flavor.  

Go with the whole wheat bread and get it as a \"melt\".  The pasta salad is great, as well as the daily soups for sides.

Great ice too (nugget style)."}
{"text":"Love The MayoBird! Their curry chicken salad is the best I've ever had, as is their pimiento cheese. Nicest people and delicious food! Perfect for takeout or a long lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"Well, I just loved it. Cute place, great chicken salad!  I had the athlete- a salad with two scoops of chicken salad, so I tried the southern (eggs and pickles) and the harvest (grapes, apples, pecans).  Both were very tasty, but southern was my fave. I brought most of the second scoop home. One thing to know- this place is at 1531 East Blvd , not 531 as it says in Yelp."}
{"text":"Chicken salad any way you want it. The Athlete is two large scoops of whatever flavors you want and a salad. The Heater is delish and super spicy. The Loaded was tasty and a good complement to the Heater.  Creamy balsamic dressing and toasty pita chips made the meal!"}
{"text":"Charming place in the old Caribou coffee joint.  Staff are very friendly and work hard - food comes out in just a few minutes.  I've been three times now for lunch during the week.

I have three problems with this place (or, as consultants like to call them, \"opportunities\"):
1)  Value.  The price paid for what you receive doesn't fare that great compared to their lunchtime competitors on East Blvd or elsewhere.  Fairly steep for a sandwich and a few pieces of broccoli and raisins.
2)  Taste.  I love chicken salad.  Really.  It could be it's own food group with me.  I really want this place to be successful.  All of their chicken salads I've tried (about 5 of them) are dry.  Really dry.  Mayo based or non-mayo based.  All dry.  Their best chicken salad I've tried is a special (BBQ chicken salad - really unique flavors with cinnamon!) and it was still dry.  Their bread - dry.  It's hard to decipher if the bread is just old or it's fresh and just lacks moisture.  Broccoli salad tastes great, but see above.....portion size of broccoli is somewhere between 5 and 7 pieces the two times I've ordered it.
3)  The details.  Their pricing is a little weird.  If you order a sandwich and a side, it's $8.95.  Add cheese to your sandwich for $0.50 more.  Total $9.45.  Or, you can order a \"melt\" and a side, which is a sandwich with cheese that just happens to be melted, for $8.95.  Huh?  If you place a take out order, they give you this tiny cheap plastic fork, no spoon, no knife.  Most of the time, that would be ok, except when your ordered side salad comes with large pieces of lettuce.  That fork's not cutting anything.  Inside the restaurant, like I wrote above, the decor is charming and the staff are great, but nothing flows well from the guest's perspective.  Speed is fine, but standing in line to order you have wait staff walking through you.  You walk past the counter area to place your order then back the opposite direction to get your drinks and then a different direction to sit down or wait for your order.

None of these things are earth-shattering, \"stay away from this place\"-type faults.  With a few small changes, this place has the location, the great front porch, the unfulfilled niche, the staff etc to be successful.  I wish them well."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Had the loaded chicken salad (adds bacon, sour cream, chives) on bread.  The mushroom and spinach soup was the best mushroom soup I have ever had. Eclectic comfy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am bummed out about my first experience here. I was looking forward to trying the local coffee. I had a cappuccino and my husband had a vanilla sugar latte plus we had a croissant. The coffees were nothing but milk with no strength to them. His latte had an extra shot but it was still weak. Ordered a plain croissant. Was hoping for something along the lines of French. Instead it tasted like it came out of the package."}
{"text":"May-yo-boy eat there again. I almost gave it four stars because everybody else did, but I gave it 5."}
{"text":"Love the food at the new mayo bird on east blvd, and have been several times.  My only complaint is can we have real silver wear, the plastic fork in a bag is a bit low brow when bkfst for two was twenty five dollars....also not very green !!!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I tried this place for the first time since we were in the area... I had the Caprese Quiche, which was good, but not very filling. My bf had the hash brown bacon and cheese cup and was not impressed by it: it was dry and not very flavorful.  Don't know if we would be back again. The decor is very cute though."}
{"text":"I entered the Mayobird hoping for a premier meat slathered in mayo experience, but I was left pretty unhappy.  I ordered the chicken roll and the curry chicken sandwich to split with a coworker.  It took the staff several minutes to even notice me at the register, even though the lunch rush was long since over.  The sandwiches were tiny, and totally over priced at around $8 a piece.  The chicken roll came on large puffy cold bread that was way thicker than the filling.  The chicken salad itself was serviceable, but the original (which should be their flagship) was totally bland and underseasoned.  The curry chicken was marginally better.  My to go order sat for several minutes in the window until I begged the wait staff to actually give it to me.  The worst part came after when I checked my credit card, and I had been overcharged by $30.00!  I tried to call the restaurant about this for a few hours and the phone line was busy the entire time...  it gets 2 stars for being edible, but the poor value and poor service will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Bright, clean, spacious and homey. Makes me want to return for their all day breakfast and stay reading a book and sipping one of their espresso drinks. 

Decent chicken salad sandwiches and sides. The food is nothing that will blow your mind but it's a nice lunch spot."}
{"text":"Get the New England Roll. It's an extra 50 cents and it will WOW you. Describing it as excellent is an understatement. BUT it must be fresh.  Went there once, and it wasn't (not sure why) and it was underwhelming.  (Advice to management - don't serve day-olds). But that only happened once and knowing what the fresh ones taste like - it was worth coming back again (and again).  Great atmosphere - the positive reviews are really accurate. I've only tried the Harvest but coming from someone who hates mayonnaise, this is an excellent chicken salad.  The soup is very rich and delicious."}
{"text":"I was a bit unsure about this place when it first opened, but I have been back several times now and I like it quite a bit. I know people complain that the the chicken salad doesn't have enough mayo, but I prefer it that way. I can't stand southern salads (and yes, I'm southern) that are dripping with the stuff, whether it's pimento cheese or macaroni salad or tuna or chicken salad, I can't deal with piles of mayo. It masks the actual salad flavors when you load it down with fatty goop. The Loaded and The Real Dill are my two personal favorites. If you're hungry and you want something filling, get the sliders, as they are the best value IMO. They come with lettuce and tomato and, for me, make for a very filling meal. I'm not as into their sides just due to my own personal taste, and I don't need them with my meal. Pita chips are good though. Service is always very friendly and solid, I get the unsweet tea which is always fresh (and sometimes flavored, which is nice!). Atmosphere and decor is really nice as well.

I do think that it would go a long way in appeasing people to add maybe a complimentary pickle spear (pickled okra or beans even, something fun?) or whatnot to the meal orders. I understand the logistics and finances when it comes to running a business, but it's the little things that can make or break it for a lot of customers. Or take a hint from JJ's across the street and consider a pickle bar or some such. Either way, the restaurant is a great place and a solid idea, and I hope they succeed in the long run."}
{"text":"I went to The Mayobird for a to-go lunch today, and I am so glad I did! I work down the street, and I'm always looking for something different for lunch. Not only is this place different. Its AMAZING! The lady at the register was patient with me (i was a touch overwhelmed by the menu) and gave me phenomenal recommendations. I got the loaded chicken salad with the broccoli salad, and they were both so tasty my mouth is still watering. Everyone that works there was so pleasant and friendly! Next time, I'll try calling in my order, though. If you are any where near East Blvd, you NEED to stop by. I can't wait until I forget to bring my lunch to work again, so I have an excuse to go back to The Mayobird! The parking lot is big enough, but the place is so popular you might have to drive around the circle for a minute, but it's more than worth it!"}
{"text":"5 stars is based on the fact that you know you are going to somewhere to get chicken salad.  Otherwise, you may be disappointed.  This is a great lunch spot and there is ample parking.  There is seating indoors or a small patio on the front.  There is an assortment of different types of chicken salads and different ways to serve chicken salad.  I have tried a few different ones:  loaded potato, dill, egg+pickle, and blue cheese.  My favorite so far has been the dill.  The sides are also very good.  I have enjoyed the pasta salad and the broccoli salad.  There are other items on the menu such as quiche, but I have always gotten the chicken salad."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. I came here to do work but on a Friday afternoon it is a little loud and crowded. I think it is still a good envirormwnr if you want to get some work done if you don't mind the noise. Cool open space, parking was okay -I found a space despite it being crowded. Harvest chicken salad is great! Matcha has weird floral essence."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing atmosphere. Love this place!  I had the loaded...loved it. The broc side was really good too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food, and service are all excellent. I had the original chicken salad sandwich on a pita and it was delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place, not only for the FANTASTIC food, but also to relax with friends. My personal favorite is the Big Bird! I could eat that night and day :) You definitely have to try the banana pudding, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Cool new spot on East Blvd. Can't beat the chicken salad, but the pasta salad is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I tried the 3 sandwich sampler and was disappointed after reading the reviews here. It's so close to Teeter that if I'm craving a chix sal I'll go for the cheaper and delish HT chicken salad on sourdough vs. Mayobird.  I've always loved this space, even when it was Caribou, so it's a good meetup place with friends but I wouldn't go for the food."}
{"text":"Took my family there for breakfast.  Great atmosphere, super-friendly employees and good food.  My big complaint is the flimsy plastic silverware.  For the price, and quality of food they're selling, Mayobird needs to step up and provide real silverware (or at least better quality plasticware)!"}
{"text":"The Mayobird is one of my favorite places in Charlotte for lunch. With a chicken salad for whatever mood you're in, there is always something for everyone. My favorites? A tie between the Nuts and Berries and Harvest chicken salads. Love it with a green salad. It's nice to have a relatively healthy, high protein meal option around. Their outdoor seating is killer- covered picnic tables, rocking chairs on the porch and more seating in their front courtyard. Inside is spacious as well. Staff is always friendly and helpful, as their menu has so much to offer. If you love chicken salad, then The Mayobird is a MUST! Oh and breakfast is served all day. Love that!"}
{"text":"I should probably preface this review by saying I hate chicken salad. I hate mayo. It's just not my thing and never has been. So, when my husband said he wanted to check out Mayobird real bad, I secretly just hoped there would be something on the menu that wasn't mayo based! Mayobird delivered.

Cute little space right beside Summit Room. Lots of tables and couches for seating. You order at the front and they bring your food out. My first thought was how big the menu was. There were so many daily items as well!! Lots of different varieties of chicken salad and lots of other options (soups, breakfasts, salads, etc). 

My husband got a chicken salad sandwich and I got the Breakfast Casserole. It came out in this cute ramekin and was a very nice serving. Man, this casserole was delish. Pretty much perfect for a cold day as it was nice and hot and cheesy. The flavors were amazing together.

Super friendly staff and awesome lunch experience!"}
{"text":"Cute homey atmosphere, good coffee, yummy food.

The Hippie yogurt w/ granola is a big scoop of greek yogurt that comes with their homemade crunchy granola with cranberries that's slightly sweet. If you've got a sweet tooth like me, you'll wander over to the coffee station and steal the honey jar to drizzle over your yogurt! My mother got the famous chicken salad on a roll. It was also very good."}
{"text":"Got the Greek sandwich on brioche w pasta salad. YUM. Atmosphere was very eclectic with a relaxed country feel."}
{"text":"Wow New location. 1531 east blvd in charlotte,nc.   Over 15 types of chicken salad! Awesome desserts like hummingbird cake and coke a cola cake!   Just like mom made!   Also The FOOD NET WORK WORLD FAMOUS AS SEEN ON TV CHICKEN ON BUTTERED AND GRILLED NEW ENGLAND Roll !!!!   Great prices!"}
{"text":"The German Chocolate brownie is awesome! 17 kinds of chicken salad, I have had four- The loaded, pickle and egg, Mediterranean and Buffalo. The Buffalo was okay but the other three were amazing! The grape salad is a unique side dish that is worth trying it is more like a dessert. It's casual dining, you can sit outside there are heaters and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've heard this place has great coffee and drinks selection. Still to be determined..

I was under the weather looking to find a nice cup of soup. I was hoping this place would have an incredible soup selection. Luckily they do tasting, because both the tomato bisk and the broccoli cheddar were disgusting. 

I left hungry."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and yummy! The service is always prompt and friendly! Great place to have a business meeting or just meet up with friends!!"}
{"text":"Lots of chicken salad choices so go for the sliders, where you try three types.  Made fresh salads and comes on nice bun with option of lettuce, tomato or onion.  Nice variety of deserts and Coca Cola is not to sweet was a perfect finish to go with a perfectly made iced coffee.  Nice atmosphere, you order at the counter and the bring to you, table markers are wooden numbered spoons.  Tasted great and they do food truck..... awesome"}
{"text":"This place is awesome...excellent sweet potato and ham biscuits, frittata cup with kale and goat cheese, and pastries.  Cool venue, relaxed ambience.  The Summit Room looks like a good spot to check out, too..."}
{"text":"I had read the hype about MayoBird in CharMag and the first people on Yelp and so I went for lunch and was disappointed but hubs went for breakfast and raved so I returned for breakfast/coffee and was super happy. So my rating is an average of my 2 star lunch rating and 4.5 star breakfast.

For lunch, there are a number of chicken salads you can choose from with various ingredients. I am actually a mayo-hater, so I'm probably the worst person to bring here, but I was happy to opt for the colonel mustard which was dijon-based. Hubs had a mayo-based one which wasn't super mayo-y but he also complained about it being dry. The main problem we had with our sandwiches (he had his on bread, mine on croissant) was that it didn't come with anything else. I really wanted LTO and maybe chutney or some sort of spread. He also wanted something a little extra. It is just meat on a hunk of bread, but if you had a function and got a quart of it to go, I bet it would be great. I do like that they don't mash the crap out of the chicken and it's more chunky and resembles real chicken. There's another chicken salad place in town which shall remain nameless that has a gross consistency. So I'll take dry and chunky any day over that grossness. My hope is that they start adding accoutrements to the sandwiches and maybe some additional choices for those who might not like chicken salad. 

But let's move on to happier times- their quiche!!! Forget the whole \"real men don't eat quiche\" thing- the sausage quiche is flaky, filling, flavorful and fabulous. Oh, maybe I shouldn't mix \"real men\" and fabulous in the same concept. Anyway, just try it. Few places nail quiche crust but they did. It makes me want to try their dessert pies that they offer. They also have a caprese quiche. They are much more filling than the frittata cup.  

Their fruit cup side is absolutely delicious- forget about the tasteless or soggy fruit salad you get other places. These grapes are super crisp and melon fresh and sweet. Thank you!!

Their coffee (if you stay) comes bold and strong in a ginormous mug that keeps you warm on a cold day. There are so few places that brew good coffee- I guess they realized if they're going to fill the shoes of Caribou, they better make damn good coffee and they delivered. I appreciated that the space is large and it's a perfect place to meet someone. I believe they might have wifi. 

Bottom line: great place to meet someone for breakfast or just nosh on a quiche with great coffee. Or pick up a wide variety of chicken salads to go for a shower or event."}
{"text":"So I discovered the Mayobird the other day when my companion and I decided to treat ourselves to breakfast out. Driving down East Blvd. I quickly pulled out yelp in hopes of finding a new place; the Mayobird popped up so I
we pulled in.  I like to eat breakfast out and in this area I expected to shell out about $8-11 per plate. However, I was pleasantly amazed when I saw that basically everything on the breakfast menu is less than $5.  We ordered quiche, French toast, and honeybun coffee cake. Everything was delicious, the coffee came tasted EXACTLY like a honeybun and the French toast was more like bread pudding than breakfast! In the end we took left overs of the quiche and French toast which made a great lunch that day and breakfast the next.  The OJ is also legit! They also have full coffee house drink options (normal coffee house prices) and serve lunch (so many chicken salad choices!) but I can't speak to the taste of any of that. 

In the end, I am in love and will be visiting again and again!"}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I love the decor and charm of this place! The staff is super friendly and there are many dining room tables that serve as space for people to meet and work with wi-fi. I ordered a croissant and was a bit disappointed by the fact that it seemed microwaved (?). It was chewy and a little tough on the edges, albeit warm when I received it. The orange juice has a TON of pulp so I imagine that it's fresh-squeezed. 

To make a full judgement call, I will have to come back for lunch soon. The patio would be enough to send me back here on a warmer day."}
{"text":"Excellent quiches. The pastry crust was light flakly and really good. The smoked mozzarella  quiche was our favorite."}
{"text":"Indoor and outdoor seating in a casual charming setting. I ordered the harvest chix salad on a toasted Crescent roll and was not dissapointed, it came with soup.  Was with a party of 5 and everyone loved what they got. Lunch bill was $48."}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here for a while - any spot that specializes in something as specific as chicken salad is a thumbs up in my book. I love all the variety of flavors, ranging from dill, to nuts and berries (almond and cranberries), southern with pickles and eggs, roasted jalapenos, greek yogurt, etc. They also do a special flavor of the month, based on customers' preferences and feedback (COOL!). 

The menu is fabulous. Basically, you pick a flavor of chicken salad, and pick a combo - you can get it on brioche, whole wheat bread, a croissant, a pita, mini buns, or even over a salad or paired with soup. You can get 1 or 2 scoops. Initially, I didn't think 1 scoop would be enough, but paired with the sandwich and side, it was plenty. However, it was very tasty so I easily could have done two scoops. 

I went with the MAYOBIRD, including a choice of sandwich with 1 side. For the chicken salad, I chose the Greek chicken salad, which consists of greek yogurt, feta, onions, cucumbers, tomatoes and olives, on top of a croissant. The croissant was in one word: amazing. It was soft, buttery in a light way, and not too heavy. I also got a side salad. Props to Mayobird for not upcharging for a side salad like many places do. They do have many tasty side options themselves, including grape salad, broccoli salad, fruit, potato chips, homemade pita chips, or pasta salad. They actually give you some homemade pita chips with the side salad, so bonus to get to taste them. I would have liked them to be a little softer but alas, they were still good. 

The inside is adorable with wooden tables and chairs, and a large sitting area with couches too. Great breakfast/lunch spot, or place to just come hang. They serve breakfast all day (!) and also have a coffee bar, so it also serves as a great location for studying or just camping out and getting some work done with great food. The staff is very friendly and timely - my food was ready within 5 minutes and they came by to grab my plate when I was finished.

Also like Nikki said, they have the BEST ICE here. I love the little small pebble types. It makes the drink taste SO MUCH better, you don't even know.

Great experience here - I will definitely be back to try more flavors."}
{"text":"Not typically someone that goes out of their way or ever orders chicken salad but I loved my lunch at Mayobird.

The interior is adorable. Very girly, industrial rustic decor and cute patio out front. You order at the counter, grab a number and sit down/wait - perfect lunch spot. They also have their own large parking lot.

Called in my order of the health nut with a scoop of Italian (pesto and sundried tomatoes). It was delicious but maybe a little steep for $10 just for one lunch."}
{"text":"Came to get some coffee and early lunch. My latte was absolutely delicious and just what I needed after a crazy morning at home. I ordered a melt with the heater chicken salad and of course it tasted amazing and was toasted to perfection. Would recommend the mayobird to anyone. 10/10!!  
Love the knowledgeable staff and cozy environment."}
{"text":"sitting in the Mayobird as I draft this...also working, too, but figured I might as well squeeze in a review.

after a double at Flywheel ya girl needed some protein, and didn't want to break the bank on breakfast...so i figured i'd give this a whirl.

I wasn't quite super impressed with not a ton of gluten free options but i opted for the crustless quiche. you can't omit the cheese since they are premade but it was delicious. had a great almond milk latte, too.

very noisy to work from but other wise a really sweet, cozy space."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Creative selection of chicken salad flavors and healthy options. My only gripes were the lack of gluten free bread and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A MUST GO!  (had to put that first just in case you didn't feel like reading a whole review)

Parking is the only drawback...The selection of chicken salads is pretty extensive.  I had the Curry and the Walnut/Cranberry.  Both were OUTSTANDING.  

This place is a converted house and is really cozy.  

The service is prompt and very friendly.  

2 scoops is a pretty good amount, not like Subway scoops! 

This will be a regular place for me and I can't wait to go back.  I strongly recommend trying Mayobird!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with adorable, DIY type feel and super nice staff.  They offered to refill my coffee and clean up for me when I was in a rush.  I haven't had a chance to try their chicken salad yet, but can't wait! I've heard good things.  Great place for meetings and studying!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for the first time after it being recommended so many times by friends. The restaurant itself is so cute and the perfect place to have lunch at and the outside seating area is even better. I hate that I forgot who rung me up because she was SO NICE. Her friendly customer service is one of the many reasons I will be returning back again. She recommended I try the Southern & Italian which were her favorites. I ordered the sliders and added the Jalape√±o one just to try. The pesto chicken salad is the only one that is made without mayo. It was amazing. The chicken salad was fresh and the pesto was good. The Jalape√±o was also very good! There was some heat from the peppers but not enough to make it not enjoyable. I thought the southern was good but the other two I ordered knocked it out the park. Also, side note, they have the good ice!"}
{"text":"Tried the slider plate with a big bird, Italian and a southern slider.   The big bird is great for those who love curry.  The combination of curry and apple chunks were great.   The Italian has a great combo of pesto and sun dried tomatoes.  The southern had a great combination of eggs mayo and pickles.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Okay- this place is so delicious that I have eaten here twice in the last six hours after first trying it for breakfast this morning. I love everything about it- the menu selection, the FOOD of course, and the decor and vibe. I had the Harvest Chicken Salad in the buttered roll with a side of broccoli salad.  It.  Was.  Devine.  Run- don't walk- to get lunch here!"}
{"text":"Tried The Mayo Bird finally and what a great place! We're in love. Casual, relaxed farmhouse feeling inside with tables and couches. Order at the counter and find your own spot to hang. Ordered a Colonel Mustard Melt, fruit bowl and Hop Drop n Roll. Two thumbs up. Rocking chairs on the front porch along with the whole vibe just makes you want to stay forever and chill out. The chicken salad, which is what they are known for, lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"The Mayobird is a fun little rustic place that has an expansive menu that features twists on a classic southern sandwich.

My wife and I dropped in on a whim for a quick lunch because I had wanted to try this place for a while. First off, their menu is pretty expansive. I was impressed with not only their options of chicken salad, but also their breakfast items that they serve all day. I settled on the harvest chicken salad sandwich and my wife got the quiche of the day. While waiting for our food, we ended up sitting on one of the couches set up in the place. Since it splits a building with The Summit Room, I find it to have a similar overall style with a little more laid back atmosphere. Once we got our food we dived in. I found the sandwich to be pretty good, but wish I had gotten the sliders so I could have tried more varieties of their chicken salad. However, my wife's quiche was awesome and we both agreed it was the better of the two dishes.

Overall this was a fun stop and I would have liked the chance to have a coffee and hang out longer. Prices are a bit high for the sandwiches in my opinion (~$7.50 w/o any sides), but my wife's breakfast quiche was on point and a good size for $5. I would recommend stopping by as they hold decent ground against the booming food scene that has developed in Dillworth over the last few years."}
{"text":"Chicken Salad Heaven! Free range chicken. Like a picnic every day!

We went here for lunch and this place is so cute - very homey. I really liked the style of the place - farm tables and mis-matched dining chairs that look like they came from your granny's house. Little chicken and rooster salt and pepper shakers everywhere and they give you a wooden spoon as a table marker - how cute is that!?

The good:

If you want a summer time lunch on a great patio that feels like a picnic. This is your place. They have amazing chicken salad mixtures that make up most of the menu - but they do also have other stuff if you aren't into chicken salad.

I had the southern style with added pickles and eggs because that is how my mom makes it and it was YUMtastic!

Great coffee, great dessert options. (I wanted that coconut cake!)

Only suggestion: 

The breads were  a little dry. I would invest in a partnership with a local bakery or hire a baker to do some specialty breads and then this place would be double off the hook amazing!

Patio is awesome.

Extra star just for the fact that the owner or manager (not sure which) came up to us and explained the menu and how everything works."}
{"text":"I call it my uptown office, great for breakfast or lunch, love the sliders, love the coffee.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great service."}
{"text":"A restaurant dedicated to artisanal chicken salad? Yes please!!!
I run and/or drive by this location several times a week but for some reason never stopped by until two weeks ago. I met a friend there for lunch and had a truly delightful experience! 

First, there is FREE parking -which is a big deal along East Blvd! The location is easy to find, and the building is relatively easy to get in and out of during the lunch rush. 

The interior has a trendy/shabby chic vibe that was super inviting. There are several couches and tables of different sizes to accommodate different sized parties. After we took in the general ambiance, my friend and I walked up to the counter and spent about 10 minutes weighing our options because the menu had so many fabulous and creative chicken salad options! 

My friend ordered the chicken pot pie, which she was kind enough to let me sample -it was the best pot pie I've ever had! I ordered the Heater Health Nut, which is a jalapeno chicken salad served on a house salad. The Heater chicken salad was spicy enough to have a good kick without being so overpoweringly spicy that you couldn't enjoy the flavor of the food. I also want to make note of the tea; I'm not a true southerner and was raised drinking unsweet tea (blasphemy, I know)... in addition to serving fabulous chicken salad concoctions, Mayorbird makes a mean fresh brewed unsweet iced tea! 

I can't wait to go back and try another one of Mayobird's chicken salad concoctions!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Mayobird for a long time now. I was not disappointed when I finally made it in! I tried three sliders with 3 different chicken salads atop of them - real dill, southern, and loaded. I honestly loved them all and couldn't tell you my favorite! Real dill was what I expected from chicken salad and it felt familiar. Southern had eggs in it which I loved and the loaded chicken salad reminded me of a yummy baked potato!

I loved the environment inside and the staff was very friendly. I went on a Sunday afternoon and had no problems with parking ro waiting."}
{"text":"Cute, unique place. I enjoyed the chicken salad with pecans and grapes (on wheat) with the cucumber salad. It was just enough food to feel satisfied, but not over-full. The outside seating was nice on a sunny day. I'd like to try one of yummy looking desserts and drinks next time!"}
{"text":"First time but not last, relaxing casual atmosphere with phenominal chicken salads."}
{"text":"Came across this little gem by searching \"best patio lunch\" on Yelp. They are open until 4pm, which is perfect for a late lunch, where as most places like this close at 3:00. Very rustic country decor, with a fast casual counter and chalk board menu. Lots of chicken salad options- hence the name Mayo Bird!  I chose the classic salad on their signature chicken roll. Very good, but I was a little jealous that I wasn't more adventurous with how many varieties they have to offer. My husband had a spicy jalape√±o chicken salad which was really good. Finished off the meal with two perfect cappuccinos and a giant slice of their honey bun cinnamon coffee cake.  We dined on their patio, and even though it is on a busy street it is absolutely lovely. Some tables are partially shaded with tree cover, some have umbrellas, and they also have a welcoming covered porch with oversized rocking chairs. The staff are all friendly and upbeat. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been craving chicken salad since I left. I got the sliders and loved being able to sample 3 varieties. Can't wait to visit again on my next Charlotte visit. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with tables and some couch seating. Great outside patio area. 
We went for brunch and had amazing Pure Intentions coffee, blueberry waffles and house made granola with yogurt. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced that people are still treating this place like it's Caribou Coffee.

For years, this location was a Caribou Coffee, where individuals were welcomed to sit for hours, reading, yapping, or tapping at the laptop - regardless of whether you spent any money there. 

When I walked in for a business lunch, I felt I was surveying the same scene. There were no seats available - not surprising for lunch hour at a new spot on East Boulevard with a cute name. Yet many people seated weren't eating, and some large tables were occupied by one person.

98% of the customers were women. Surprising in these health-conscious times, considering \"mayonnaise\" is the root word of the establishment.

Mayobird could likely benefit from a more structured seating program - at least during peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"Great rustic hip vibe in this place.   They sell everything from all day breakfast, coffee, espresso, beer, chicken salad, and chicken salad without mayo.  This place is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  If you do order the chicken salad make sure you get it on the new England roll."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past week, it is so good! I actually had never tried chicken salad before last week (crazy since I have lived in Charlotte my whole life) and they let me sample as many as I wanted. I was torn between the harvest and the loaded but ultimately went with the harvest on a croissant ( the harvest is their most popular ). It was very good but I do feel like the croissant overpowers the flavor of the chicken salad. The pita chips have good flavor but can be quite hard.  I really like the sauce that comes with them (tastes like a spicy ranch) but I recently tried the broccoli cheddar soup and much prefer that to the chips.  All the soups as well as the rest of the menu is homemade in house (except the breads which are from a local bakery, Nova).  This place is a must try if you are looking for a delicious, light, healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat. Started off with a cup of the best coffee I have ever had. I had to ask and it was roasted locally by Pure Intentions. I ordered the breakfast casserole. It was outstanding. This place has charm. The folks that work here are attentive and kind. The prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Great spot to meet a friend, bring a book, do work or just sit on the porch on a rocking chair and relax with coffee! I love the breakfast options- especially \"The Frenchy\". For lunch I like to mix it up but probably lean toward The Buffalo, Harvest or Colonel Mustard the most. Sit in the back by the fireplace on a cold day or on the rocking chairs on the front on a nice day! Treat yourself to a rice krispy treat (shaped like a birds nest)."}
{"text":"Been here several times for lunch and kept forgetting to post how great the food was every time!  I was sad when caribou closed until this gem took its place. My personal favorite is the blue bird with walnuts and blue cheese on a croissant. Just tried the pot pie today and it was very delicious. The interior of this place is shabby chic, rustic, and adorable. Also great for coffee and breakfast. Could shove 5 of their savory breakfast cups in my face the way some do doughnuts in the morning. Great place for work meetings, free WiFi!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some coffee before a meeting. The outdoor patio is fantastic! I didn't have any of the food (which looked delicious), but the coffee left a lot to be desired. My friend got a mocha that tasted burnt and bland, and my iced caramel latte was lacking in flavor and had chunks of caramel floating around. Also, they're pricey... our two drinks totaled more than $10. They are still young, so it hopefully won't be long before their shots are as good as the food looks."}
{"text":"I love this place. Bo and his whole staff are sweet and make you feel right at home. Seriously, the food is amazing but you know when you go somewhere and the service is so friendly too that you feel like the experience was that much more amazing - Yeaaaaa that's how I feel about mayobird  I always get the Greek chicken salad - Health nut with the balsamic on the side - the harvest and nuts and berries are also great. They have all kinds of chicken salads so if you're not a mayo person don't let the name fool you, there's plenty of non mayo options! Support this local spot, you will not be disappointed! Oh and the pita chips - yes please, I'll save my carbs all day for these when they're fresh, yum!!"}
{"text":"OK, but not worth the price IMO.  2 sodas, an order of sliders (no side), and a grilled cheese was $20.  Tried 3 different chicken salads including Southern (the best), Buffalo, and Loaded (too decadent IMO).  None of them blew me away like others I have had in the past.

Staff were courteous and service was quick, so no complaints there.  Guess it's just not my cup of tea..."}
{"text":"- I had the Tuna which was WAY TOO salty. I also had the grape salad which I LOVED!! It had grapes, brown sugar and nuts. If you love sweets you WILL LOVE IT! 

- Soooo walking in was so confusing.

-  We did not know where to place our order or if we was suppose to be seated and waiter or waitress will come over to take our order.  

- The only sign we seen was for picking up orders

- Parking was OK not the best 

- This place was pricy for a Tuna sandwich and the grape salad I paid $15.00(and that was with no drinks). 

- The cashier DID NOT explain things,  I was handed a wooden spoon thinking someone will call my name. Not knowing what to do with it

- They totally forget about my co-worker food (she order before me) and we late coming back from lunch 

- I did see outdoor seating, I think I even seen a fire pit

**  I don't think I will visit them again ( something I really don't say after just one visit, but that one visit really rub me the wrong way). If it was not for that grape salad, they would have gotten 1 star from me"}
{"text":"This place is just adorable and the food is good to back up the charming decor which is the most important part!  I've been twice now and have tried 4 different kinds of the chicken salad.  First time I had to try the Southern with pickles and eggs on that ridiculous sounding hot, buttered, toasted roll.  The roll really was great but that wasn't my favorite chicken salad, however my side of macaroni salad was perfect, if you like a mayo mac salad.

This most recent trip I went with sliders to try a few different kinds of the chicken salads.  I went with buffalo, harvest with the grapes and apples and nuts, and the loaded with bacon and sour cream.  And again had to have the macaroni salad.  All three were really tasty but if I have to pick a favorite I think its the harvest.  The grapes really add a nice light touch.  My one minor complaint, and I might be in the minority here, I could use a bit more mayo in the chicken salad.  Or maybe if they put it on the bread that would help.  I am sure if I ask for it they will be happy to oblige, because that's another thing, the staff is incredibly nice and helpful!  Happy to help with an order selection, happy to come help clear tables, the way they greet customers and wish you well on your way out, these are just friendly people!

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is I do think the prices can add up a bit quick and before you know it you have a $15 lunch on your hands.  But as long as its not my daily lunch spot I can deal with that for a quality spot with some delicious grub every now and then."}
{"text":"What an adorable restaurant! Loved the decor and the seating.  Very pretty.

Got a sandwich to go. Cost $8. What I got in my styrofoam box was...a sandwich. No pickle. No chips. No little container of cole slaw. Nothing but an $8 sandwich.  To me, this is really unforgivably chintzy. 

The harvest chicken salad was okay but a bit bland. The bread was also rather dry.

Such a shame. I really, really wanted to like this place so much more, if only to go back and enjoy the atmosphere again. But I guess I won't be headed back.

MayoBird...please take the hint...I've never even SEEN a sandwich as the only item in a to-go box! Even a pickle spear would have turned this into a 3- or 4-star review."}
{"text":"Despite the off-putting name, Mayobird is a great lunch spot! Located in the heart of Charlotte, Mayobird is quick, easy, and delicious. 

At Mayobird, you choose if you want a sandwich, salad, sliders, etc. and then pick your flavor of chicken salad to go on top. I got the health nut, which is a salad which a scoop of chicken salad on top, with the Harvest chicken salad (has apples, grapes, and pecans mixed in). So delicious and would definitely go back. Added bonus-- they have the delicious, soft pellet ice for drinks!"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite food truck in Charlotte. The Mayobird puts a delicious twist on chicken salad that makes me come back for more every time. My favorites? The sliders: the southern, loaded and Italian. Check them out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is an awesome breakfast, late breakfast and lunch place. They have a great selection to build your own breakfast sandwich, and the quiches are amazing. The breakfast casserole is a must have because it comes with everything. 

For lunch though, there is a chicken salad for everyone. It is fresh and light and there is so much comfortable seating that I feel like I'm at home again. They have the REALLY good pellet ice that you can chew on too! Definitely a must try for something fresh and different if you are in the Dilworth area or after a morning at Freedom Park."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today! What an awesome new place on east blvd. I got a Greek chicken salad pita and broccoli salad side and both were amazing! I cannot wait to go back and try something else. The patio is also a great spot to hang out. I highly recommend this place if u like chicken."}
{"text":"Perks:  You get a cute wooden spoon to take to your table to have your food delivered.

The rest:  I paid $11ish for a cup of coffee and a turkey sandwich (wasn't feeling chicken salad but how hard is it to make a turkey sandwich?). There was half a piece of lettuce on the sandwich - not a huge deal I suppose, unless you asked for extra lettuce. Ahem. I tried the grape salad with nuts - a cup of perfectly good grapes, a few chopped walnuts and some runny, perhaps formerly yogurt mixture coating it all. There wasn't a place for us to place our order number spoons when we sat at the rocking chairs so holding them up was kind of a drag. And the coffee?!?! Gads, just don't get me started. If I'm going to spend three dollars, I'd rather it not be on some burnt-tasting, stale, ill-flavored cup of \"coffee\"...

Do what you want - my roommate goes to Mayobird at least twice a week. I on the other hand feel that some food trucks shouldn't be restaurants. Stick to what you know."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch when I am in Charlotte.  The food is fresh and well prepared.  There are so many different kinds of chicken salad I can always find something I want.  I love the soups, especially the tomato.  I have also been there for breakfast and the French toast and honey bun cake satisfy my morning sweet tooth.  The restaurant is always clean and inviting and the people who work there are friendly and welcoming.  I have always gotten exactly what I ordered and it was served quickly."}
{"text":"Great find for our lunch today. We had the caprese and the harvest. Bottom line, the chicken salad is excellent! Treated myself to the peppermint mocha latte for dessert... yummmm. Cute place. You order right as you come in the door and they give you a wooden spoon to put in the spool on the table. Ignore the other review, it's really not hard to figure it out. LOL"}
{"text":"Supreme deliciousness!!  The grape salad is so good.  Been twice and will definitely come back again to try different ones. Recommend the Caprese, the Italian and hands down the Harvest."}
{"text":"AMAZING! So pleased with my first experience! I choose the big bird (a yellow curry chicken salad) and my friend had the harvest chicken salad. They were both excellent! I can't wait to try them all!"}
{"text":"Great place!  This was my first time visiting and I went for lunch w two friends! I had the Healthy Nut which was one scoop of chicken salad ( whichever flavor) and then salad and some puta chips! All under $10!  I chose the Italian chicken salad which was NOT mayo based. It was made w pesto ! Very, very tasty! I was full when I left! 

We went at lunch , so it was busy and had to wait about 15 minutes but again I think it was the time we were there! 

I would recommend!"}
{"text":"If you've ever even thought of opening a lunch spot, it should be legally required for you to visit The Mayobird first. The only reason you and your friends spend 20 minutes arguing about where to go to eat is because you forget places like this exist.

The concept is simple - everything is chicken salad. Don't like chicken salad, you're wrong. There's something for you here.

The people make the place like they do anywhere, but the ambiance mixed with carefully crafted look and feel of the outside and inside make this the go to spot for lunch on a Saturday.

My biggest frustration with The Mayobird is that Yelp! didn't tell me about this place. I had to hear about it from a friend, which I imagine is the only remaining rationale for why we haven't abandoned human interaction for our electronic devices as of yet."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have looked into this before I went to Mayobird, but I didn't realize they only had chicken salad. I'm not the biggest fan of chicken salad, but they did have a large selection of different kinds - including some without mayo, which was ideal for me since I'm not a mayo fan. With that being said, I thought the food was decent, but was a little overpriced for what I actually received. I purchased 3 \"sliders\", which was just under $9 and didn't include any sides. Call me a pig, but I was still a little hungry after the 3 sliders. 

My review may not be that valuable since I'm not big on chicken salad, but nonetheless, here it is."}
{"text":"Maybe breakfast isn't their thing.
Microwaved eggs. Slow order fulfillment. Chewy croissant.

2017.03.05
My girlfriend and I came here Sunday around  10:30. Judging from the number of people, we beat the brunch rush.  Yay us! The decor is nice and it would be someplace we would love to frequent.

We both ordered breakfast sandwiches. We were both disappointed. She ordered a croissant, that came out chewy, she suspects it was heated in a microwave.  I ordered egg and cheese on a brioche. The egg was comically small compared to the size of the bread and tough and chewy as if prepared in a microwave.  The kicker on this was that our order took about 20 minutes before it came out. We had a solid view of the expo window, it frequently backed up. They seemed far from under staffed. 4 people working the front, 2 in the kitchen.

The staff was very pleasant and helpful, the food incredibly disappointing."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place because they have a few healthy options---ones with no mayo, which don't get me wrong is delicious but not good for my waistline.  I had the Vinnie which is a balsamic vinaigrette-based chicken salad.  I asked for a sample before buying the meal and it was delicious.  Their broccoli salad as a side never disappoints either.  It had a nice dressing so that the salad is not dry."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5: inside is nice, there are couches and comfy chairs that you can sit in to study or to wait on the rest of your party. Outside seating is delectable. Lots of flowers, birds, trees, and green stuff. 

Taste: 5/5: delicious. Everything is tasty. I cannot think of a single thing that could be improved. 

Service: 4/5: Was offered a free sample of a chicken salad so that I could make an informed decision. We didn't know what we wanted, so our cashier walked us through all the options. Service was fast. 

Presentation: 3/5: nothing too fancy, you get chicken salad on a plate."}
{"text":"Lived in CLT for 6 years and never heard of this place.  Just had coffee hear.  Did not go or try the restaurant yet.  Coffee bar is great.  Fair pricing, clean, spacious, and good staff. I'll be back"}
{"text":"If you like chicken salad, the Mayobird is it. 

It's open lunch only (it turns into the restaurant Summit Room in the evenings - also good) and it has every type of chicken salad you can imagine. I love their bluebird salad (with blue cheese - it's not too strong) and their broccoli salad side with bacon. 

The staff is super-friendly and the service is quick. Parking can be a little tricky at times so come early or park on the side streets and walk a little bit."}
{"text":"A nice spot in Charlotte for a sandwich stop. My rating is mostly for the friendliness of the staff and how big, clean and cozy this place is. They have fresh squeezed orange juice which is my favorite. The food is not too bad at all, nothing is extremely delicious but it is good enough for a decent sandwhich. The place has plenty parking spots and is so convinient to how close it is with the freedom park."}
{"text":"Just a darling place with cute artifacts and the BEST Chicken Salad in the Queen City! Had the sampler plate of three kinds of chicken salads...Just loved it. Everyone at my table really liked their salad. Everything is seasoned perfectly and not a skimpy portions either.  Great Coffee and Sweet tea too!"}
{"text":"My rating is for weekday breakfast ONLY.  My client suggested meeting here and I was sad when I realized they were known for chicken salad and I was going for breakfast.  That sadness quickly dissipated however.  The parking here is easy, or was for breakfast as they have a big parking lot.  The inside is cozy and there are several tables great for a meeting, knocking work out, or catching up with friends.

  I ordered a PSL because I am basic and proud.  I ordered it with no dairy because dairy in coffee makes me feel icky.  It was a great beverage and not too sweet, perfect way to start the day and perfect for those of you out there that admit to liking pumpkin spice like me.  I ordered the quiche of the day which was a spicy jalape√±o.  It had a flaky pastry crust, egg, cheese, and of course plenty of spice.  It was heavenly and I love how the egg dishes are made in single serve bowls.  I will definitely be back for the chicken salad next time I'm in town - stay tuned!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere and since I LOVE chicken, egg and tuna salad, I thought I would love my food.  I think my error came in ordering the Greek chicken salad which was made with greek yogurt instead of mayo.  It was definitely a healthier spin, but kind of dry and definitely a bit flavorless.  I couldn't even tell there were other ingredients in it (like supposedly feta and olives).  The bacon broccoli salad on the side was awesome though.

Long story short, if I went back again, I would get something unhealthier.  Service was great though!"}
{"text":"The Mayobird is great for quick breakfast meeting, and their evening restaurant - Summit is very different and very good.  My only issue is in the morning, the music is too LOUD.  Breakfast/brunch times you have trouble hearing your table partner because the music is too LOUD (background only please!!). Otherwise - nice place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I don't go very often, and I couldn't quite tell you why, but I do like it. 

I've tried almost all of their chicken salads but my favorites are the Real Dill (dill) and Big Bird (curry). The consistency of their chicken salad is what I like the most; it's smoother than most which I prefer. 

I have tried a few breakfast items, a quiche of the day and frittata cup. Both were good but I really like going here for the chicken salad. 

If you find yourself in the mood for a mocha, I think this place has one of the best mochas in town. It is not too sweet and perfectly blended. 

It's a cozy space with friendly service on top of it all. All around a good place to stop in occasionally."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. It was fast and delicious. I had the greek chicken salad with a side salad and it was wonderful. A friend got the black bean soup....it was amazing. Fun environment with great food. I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"First time to The Mayobird and will absolutely be returning! The atmosphere was very welcoming and had southern farm fresh charm! The food was delicious, and perfect portioned for the price! Can't wait to return and try something else. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for decent chicken salad outside of my own kitchen. I have found it. My coworker told me about this place and I'm so thankful she did. Ordered lunch for myself and a few business colleagues and everyone's minds were blown. Every chicken roll that was ordered was delicious! I had the Harvest CR and, oh my! I've been feening every since. Oh and the grape salad!!! It's like bursts of happiness in my mouth!!!! GO!"}
{"text":"I came here other week on a Saturday afternoon and I enjoyed it very much. I'm a bit of a chicken salad snob, as I was spoiled with an awesome deli up in NY that just had mind blowing chicken salads. With that said, you have TONS of chicken salad options @ Mayobird. Some very good, some ok, some just mehhh. I had 3 sliders -- the Greek, the heater and the loaded - They were all just OK (3/5). I also had, the broccoli cheddar soup --  it was ok - not out of this world broccoli cheddar, but good. 

I did get a chance to try \"THE WORLD FAMOUS CHICKEN ROLL as seen on The Food Network\" lol- Basically, you get to choose any of the salads and they come served on a new England roll that's toasted with butter. I had a two bites of this WFCR with original chicken salad, and that was pretty good (4/5) and my favorite by far!

The service is GREAT and everyone is extremely helpful and friendly. The d√©cor is awesome too - you get this rustic farmhouse vibe with comfy couches everywhere. I will definitely come back here again...I will probably just stick with \"the original\" chicken salad. This would even be a great place to come to get some work done and have a cup of coffee. Overall, I would give it 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The atmosphere and layout is great. The food is good, but I think they could do a much better job on the brioche and wheat bread. Overall, I highly recommend for a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to perfect. Every chicken salad I've tried has been delicious, and the grape salad side is one of my favorite things on earth - I could eat it everyday. 

It is pricey but you know that you're getting the best quality of everything. Atmosphere of the place is also very impressive; cozy but spacious, always plenty of seating, and friendly staff. 

Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they had a gluten-free bread option. The scoops are fine and good, but I'm always envious of the other patrons' rolls and sandwiches. 

It's one of my favorite spots in Charlotte! Love the Bird."}
{"text":"I was on East Boulevard recently running errands and wanted a fast casual spot for a quick lunch. Mayobird delivered! 

On this visit, I ordered the Double Dip -- two scoops and a side. With a fountain soda, it came to just under $16. A pricy lunch but you know what they say... You get what you pay for! It was high quality, fresh food and I had enough left over to take to-go for a late afternoon snack. 

Everything comes with a few pita chips, which add a nice salty, crunch to the meal. I choose the Harvest and the Asian for my scoops. The Harvest is a regular offering, with apples, grapes, and pecans. It was good but I wish it had more apples and grapes. The Asian was a weekly special and my favorite of the two. It had a wonderful but understated peanut and soy sauce flavor. I'd order it every time if it was on their regular menu!

The restaurant itself is tucked off East Blvd. and has a warm, homey feel. There were lots of patrons there working, and I could see why. It's an easy place to want to settle into for a while. Their coffee bar seemed to be cranking out delicious beverages, too. So, caffeine fuel for all those hard workers! Great outdoor patio seating as well, which I took advantage of since it was a beautiful day. 

Icing on the cake is the owner is also the founder of Behailu Academy, supporting local youth, so you're eating good food for a good cause at Mayobird!"}
{"text":"Before i get picky, i will say, this is a good lunch spot, with really fresh food and i'm sure on multiple tries, i will find something i really like!

On my first visit i got the Original Plain Chicken salad on a buttered New England roll.  My wife made the better choice, going with the Chicken Salad melt, which had cheddar cheese and was toasted!  The Plain Chicken salad, is just that...Plain.  It's not bad, but it didn't blow me away.  I suggest going with one of their 7/8 other flavored/mixed ingredients chicken salad options.

My biggest beef was with the Broccoli salad...i love this side!  My wife makes her grandmother's recipe a lot.  However, her grandma would probably flip out, if i told her they make theirs without the sugared mayo and cheddar cheese.  It's not that it's bad..and some people may prefer the healthier version....i prefer the best version!"}
{"text":"I could seriously eat chicken salad everyday and Mayobird makes it that much easier to enjoy! I could not believe the amount of choices they had, I've never seen so many different types of chicken salad! I was tempted to get a to go container of each one but decided I'd just have to go back at least once a week to try them all! 

The southern version was really good. I would have liked to taste more pickles because I'm obsessed with pickles but that's just me. Delicious regardless. The pasta salad was perfect, tasted fresh and refreshing. My friend got the grape salad which she said was awesome so definitely need to try that as well. 

The atmosphere is so cute and very welcoming and warm, super homey. I loooove how they have different size, shape tables and all different size and shape chairs! The staff is really friendly and willing to go above and beyond to please their customers. Such a great experience and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Disappointing

What would we order again - 
Coffee
Grape salad - has pecans and brown sugar on top

What we wouldn't order again - 
Oatmeal - think water microwaved with grocery store oats.  Side of blueberries and a side of brown sugar mixed with pecans comes with it.  $2.95

Breakfast casserole - nothing special

Chicken salad (original) - heavily peppered.  Chicken Salad Chik's is so much better.

Chicken and Dumplings - too much pepper 

Props to the owners for having a recycling bin.   Wish they used compostable silverware or better yet actual silverware.  Also I HATE being asked for donations from any charity when I shop especially for a charity the Mayobird owner started.   My husband and I give money all year to worthy charities.  I don't need to be nickel and fined every retailer I go to."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken salad,soups and coffee!  Wasn't in love with their waffles with fake maple syrup but otherwise everything is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I hate mayo! Never eat it, ever, not on anything. However, I LOVE Mayobird! Go figure?!?"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile, and finally found myself in the vicinity during lunchtime. Packed on a Wednesday! I wanted to try all of the chicken salads but settled on the Heater (jalapenos) and the broccoli salad. BF got The Loaded and the Italian. We also got a side of pita chips to dip. They were all good, but the Heater was definitely my favorite. Would order again. The broccoli salad was delicious as well. I like this place because they mainly server mayo based salads-- but don't overdo the mayo! It's just enough for moisture without making you feel like a gross human. It's a little pricey for the amount of food-- but where can you choose from 15 different kinds of chicken salad?"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place because the original restaurant we wanted to go to was a 45 min wait. I'm glad we got to try this place! We ordered our food and had a nice spot outside.

I got the two scoops with pasta salad. I got the loaded and southern chicken salad. Loaded was packed with flavor with the bacon and cheddar. Southern was just as good with the eggs and onions. Pasta salad was good too. It's mayonnaise based but not too heavy. Had fresh peppers in it too! My friend got the Italian and Greek chicken salad. The Italian was good and different. She wasn't crazy about the Greek chicken salad. My husband got the sliders. He got the curry, Italian and jalape√±o. The curry was good but different! There was no way I could of finished the whole slider because it was so rich. My husband loved it though! The jalape√±o was awesome!! Had great spice to it and it was popping with flavor! I would definitely get that next time! Broccoli salad was also good especially with the bacon. 

We all had a great time. Service was awesome. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I love niche restaurants. The kind that basically do one thing, and do it well. I used to live in NYC and they're all over the place. It's nice to see a business like this open in Charlotte.  Chicken salad FTW.

The Mayobird is oozing with charm - the farmhouse theme really works here, and it is such a pleasant atmosphere for a casual meal. If you read my review of The Summit Room (The Mayobird's sister-restaurant which semi-shares the space and is only open for dinner), you'll know I wasn't crazy about the decor. I think the style just works better as a breakfast / lunch spot, in my opinion.

Both times I've been for lunch it has been packed - but the service was relatively fast and the staff are very friendly. You order at the counter and food is delivered to your table. The chicken salad is good. Maybe not my favorite of all time, but good. It's on the dry side, which personally I enjoy - I'm not crazy about mayo dripping all over the place. You can tell its freshly made with natural ingredients - a plus.  I've tried the Big Bird (curry) and the Harvest (apples, grapes, and pecans) and prefer the Harvest.  They also have some more unique flavors like loaded baked potato and buffalo chicken.  The homemade pita chips that come on the side are also quite tasty. The only drawback is that the price is a bit steep, and they really get you on the drinks - $2.50 for a fountain drink is pushing the boundary on value."}
{"text":"The original meeting during the day was for Starbucks down the road. Then we realized meh, why don't we try Mayobird as we've heard about it. Well, stop meeting up for coffee at Starbucks and go here! They do close at 4pm so make note of that. But the decor and ambience was brighter but still cozy and the tables were large enough to fit the three of us comfortably. 

4 stars for the atmosphere and space, but only 3 stars for the matcha green tea drink. An update to come on the food."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere at this place. It's easy to order and just comfortable and welcoming. I have yet to try something I haven't liked here - I'd recommend the Harvest (apples) and the Big Bird (curry) for the chicken salad and the side of broccoli salad. Fair warning: it can get packed and parking is limited."}
{"text":"I feel like I am paying extra to eat a little healthier maybe. Lunch was 15 with a drink and a side. I don't go big on the mayo based ones. I was full after 2 sliders and took the third home. The sides are pretty big and can be split to save some dough. I've eaten chicken salad about 4 times, only when I've been here. The tea is the best and hanging out with wifi and watching the World Cup was a bonus. Staff super friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because I liked the interior decor and cool small unique details (even in the bathroom) and the service was great, hence three vs. two stars. Of course I had to try the Original first. The chicken salad sandwich fell short from the \"World Famous Chicken Roll as seen on 'The Food Network'\" title. It was mushy and a bit on the salty side. I was hoping for chucks of chicken and crispy ingredients to add some crunch and texture but no luck. I'd be interested in trying out a different variation next time as well as their other items like the Chicken Pot Pie or the Back Nine, their take on pimento cheese."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pot pie and honey bun cake. The pot pie was the best I've ever had. I recommend you give it a try. The honey bun cake was also pretty good. Nice atmosphere as well. I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Charming rustic/country decor, great coffee and a small but mighty breakfast menu (served all day!)--these are the makings of a perfect spot to crank out some work, read a good book, or have a relaxed coffee date. The Mayobird might have amazing chicken salad (I wouldn't know, I've never eaten lunch here), but I actually know and love it as a coffee shop. Service is friendly and helpful, and I really love their connection to the Behailu Academy in NoDa."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. The Mayobird has turned my 4-year old into a chicken salad lover! He seriously gets excited to go every Saturday morning after soccer lessons. The staff here are friendly and accommodating.... We will continue to be regulars!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of food and the ambiance. Incredible restaurant. We got the plain, curry and loaded chicken salad and were beyond pleased with all of the options!"}
{"text":"Just think of when Duke or UNC is playing basketball (if you live in NC you should hate at least one).  What does the opposing team's student section chant when they're losing?  \"Over-rated\" *clap, clap, clap, clap, clap*  \"Over-rated\".  That in a nutshells describes Mayobird although thankfully my chicken salad at least didn't contain any nutshells.

Maybe my experience would have been better if I went sometime other than the lunch rush but nevertheless...First off while I know it's no longer a big deal because we all have GPS but it's very easy to miss the sign for the place from the road.  The other restaurant's signage dominates it.  Parking was tight as most of the cars in the lot were SUVs (consider street parking during peak hours).  Get in and since it's a first time I just want to sample some chicken salad to go and come back for dine in if I like what I ate.  Problem is, a simple take-out order took 20 minutes.  I understand restaurants operate on the FIFO system when it comes to orders (first in, first out) but someone looking to take out a scoop shouldn't have to wait that long.  Why not have some salad already packed in containers in a refrigerated case somewhere for purchase?  What that means then is because I'm waiting so long for this chicken salad when I can easily walk into Harris Teeter and pick some up without the wait is that this chicken salad better be the best damn chicken salad I ever ate.  Instead it's just meh.  I had the harvest.  Honestly comparing it to a similar chicken salad I've had, I would give the edge to that place of culinary excellence known as Subway.  Yes the chicken salad they roll out every once in a while was slightly more to my liking than this more expensive version.

The place does have a nice feel to it- think of it as hipster Cracker Barrel- and the help was friendly to avoid the one star review.  I sense this place has gotten a rep for one of those places in Charlotte you just have to check it out.  Think about that for a second.  We're talking about a place that serves chicken salad- not pizza, wings, burgers, burritos, etc.- as a must visit.  Really?  I mean nothing against chicken salad but it's not exactly the type of food one associates which going out of their way to get their best of.  And it's not like it's that hard to make your own.  See why I gave this the over-rated label now?  Good.  But just to drive the point home and counter the other reviewer- \"THIS PLACE IS NOT A MUST GO!\""}
{"text":"I have been curious to try this place for quite sometime now and finally made the move yesterday for a carryout lunch.  The dining room area was pretty full, even thought it was an hour to closing time.  I was greeted by Andrea who was working the front counter.  She was sooooo nice and helpful.  She walked me through the entire menu and helped me with my questions, because it is a bit overwhelming at first.  There are many options to choose from. 

I chose the Mayo Bird, which is a chicken salad sandwich and one side.  I had the pasta salad and picked up the Pepsi cola cake for dessert.  The sandwich was good, I got it toasted on cibatta bread.  I might get the pita next time, because I like it a little softer.  The pasta salad was extra good.  I am a fan of mayo based pasta salad and really enjoyed it.  It has a bit of a spicy taste, almost like wasabi as well.  The Pepsi cola cake was too sweet-which is odd for me, because I like everything sweet-from pasta sauce to macaroni salad....but this....waaaay to much.

I think what I liked best about this place was the layout and d√©cor of the restaurant.  It is so cool!  There is an open floor plan with many little spots to sit from open tables, to little couches and more intimate areas.  It is decorated so hipster and just makes you feel good walking in.  

Many choices of food and drink and an excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Friendly staff- mediocre coffee & breakfast casserole. Just can't get behind the concept of mayonnaise & a coffee house together. Ack."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot!

Pros:
Great concept - pretty much only chicken salads in a variety of ways
Extensive menu - about 10 different types of chicken salad
Great vibe
Great patio
Some parking

Cons:
Don't get the quiche - returned it twice before I just went with chicken salad, stick with what they're amazing at!"}
{"text":"The Mayo Bird is literally dripping with charm. I am so glad that this little spot decided to set up shop in Dilworth, it is a great addition to the neighborhood. The decor makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in the door. It feels like your Grandmother's farmhouse out in the country (my Grandma lived in Boca in a condo, but this is what I imagine this would feel like). 

The service is always on point. Very kind employees who are there to ensure that you are happy with your experience. 

On a recent visit, I watched as the guest next to me had his order wrong and the staff brought out the correct order VERY quickly and provided a free side and dessert to apologize. Just a nice attention to detail that made me want to come back. 

The patio is AMAZING. I want to spend all day sitting in one of the oversized rocking chairs, sipping the Chai Vanilla Latte in the fall. 

Food wise I have had a couple of the chicken salads, breakfast and dessert. For chicken salad I have tried the Skinny, Greek and Buffalo and loved them all. I will agree that they are on the dry side and I would like a tad bit more moisture, but still tasty. My favorite so far was a scoop of the buffalo on a salad with a side of ranch dressing.

For breakfast I had the Kale and Goat Cheese Frittata and it was delish, but the star of the show is their Honey Bun Coffee Cake. This thing is OUT OF THIS WORLD good. I have gone back twice this week since trying it on Sunday to get my fix. The icing, crunchy cinnamon, moist cake and pecans are just perfection. 

I hope that the Mayo Bird is around for a long time because I just love it."}
{"text":"Who knew you could do so much with chicken salad. It was a bit busy during the lunch rush but my meal was great and the service was good as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the best experience here. I ordered their famous chicken salad sandwich. The sandwich was very salty and was hard to eat (because of it's shape), the coffee tasted watered down as well. My last issue is, my girlfriend and I went there for lunch and  2 sandwiches and 2 drinks was $25, I thought that was a little much for a quick lunch. Yet, the place was packed and the other guests I was with enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"I have worked around the corner from this restaurant for years. I even know the manager. Today was my first trio for breakfast. Everything is made fresh, great selection and friendly staff. I can't wait to try lunch. I have my eye on their homemade soups. You gotta try this place out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite weekend lunch spot. All of the chicken salads are fabulous but my favorite is \"the Real Dill\" on a croissant. You have to get the grape salad as a side! It's like dessert.. 
The ice maker runs out quickly but it's understandable because people love the crushed ice. The servers are ALWAYS so friendly and funny. I love the staff, especially the guy with the cool dreads. He will keep your group laughing! So friendly and a hard worker. This place fills up quickly so it is sometimes hard to find a seat but I just discovered that you are able to eat on the other side of the restaurant.. phew.. what a relief. Love this place.. a must go!!"}
{"text":"We go to this place often and today everything was just...BLAND, nothing special about it. I ordered 2 italian chicken salad sandwiches, one on brioche, one on wheat, the black eyed pea salad and 2 iced coffees. The chicken salad is ok but both breads were dry and crumbly, no lettuce, tomato, onion, ...nothing. BLAND. The black eyed pea salad was watered down and squishy...not thrilled. The coffee was the best part of this lunch. Maybe it was an off day but they definitely need to upgrade their bread choice selection!"}
{"text":"This has been on my list for a while and I'm glad I finally went for a team lunch! They have so many unique kinds of chicken salad. I think there are a few other things on the menu for those that don't like chicken salad too. We got the curry, Gorgonzola pear, southern (hard boiled egg and pickle), and loaded (pimiento cheese and bacon) chicken salad scoops. All of them were amazing. The curry was the most unique. Of all of them, the pear Gorgonzola was probably our least favorite, but it was still good. The side of broccoli salad was also very good. I'll be back to visit and try more chicken salad for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had a melt with the skinny bird and it was phenomenal and put other chicken salad I've had in Charlotte to shame. The broccoli salad was delicious too. My boyfriend had the loaded chicken salad and pasta salad as a side. We didn't speak to each other the entire lunch because we were enjoying our food far too much. Super cute restaurant too! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"PROS: 
Amazingly delicious food! I love chicken salad so this place is a God-send!

CONS: 
Inconsistent customer service. 
The employees can't seem to keep the front of the store fully stocked so they disappear for long periods of time to \"the back\". 
Do not count on your orders to be right.

I'll be back, I suppose, but I'll have to be that one customer that everyone hates because they nit picks at everything to make sure they get what they asked for."}
{"text":"What a massive disappointment this place was.  I went for lunch and got a sandwich to go.  First, the flow of people trying to place orders was chaotic with a line going across the restaurant and servers constantly trying to break through it.  I got the \"swimmer\".  I asked about bread choices and was not told anything about that famous New England roll.  When I got back to work and got my sandwich out, one of the slices of bread was the heel!  I know some people like the heel but I wouldn't use it in a restaurant unless someone asks for it.  The amount of tuna on the sandwich was ridiculously small especially given the price they charge and on a personal note, how about a little tuna with your celery?  On their website they say that the celery is finely chopped and there is only a hint.  It was just bland and blah and I would not go back.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the lemon chess pie was delicious."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  Aside from the parking that is very limited, the food is well worth it.  The Mayo Bird has a variety of menu options but I chose the Original Chicken Salad Sandwich.  There is no way to remove and ingredient, so having to eat celery in the chicken salad was not my favorite part.  I did enjoy the soft bread and the side of bacon and broccoli salad.  

The servers were very friendly and the location is awesome.  It is connected to the Summit Room, another one of my favorite places to eat.  I would definite come back to the Mayo Bird to try some of their other dishes.  

Awesome job Mayo Bird, but I do believe parking may be your limiting factor."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot in the heart of Dilworth. We were greeted warmly and received a good explanation of an overwhelming menu. They make chicken salad a million ways! I went for the \"loaded version\"- bacon, sour cream, chives and cheddar- on a croissant. WONDERFUL! The flavors all came together well. I will admit that I was surprised. I guess bacon does make everything better! I chose macaroni salad (mayo based, of course at a place named \"Mayo Bird\", right?). It, too, was very tasty. We will definitely go back...maybe for breakfast which they also serve."}
{"text":"Mayobird definitely deserves an update since my review earlier this year.  Since February I have been back multiple times, trying several different items on the menu.
Not only all the employees so friendly, they are so helpful with questions, offer samples and definitely show a care for their job.
Most recently I have tried 'The Southern' chicken salad. Okay, if you like pickles and egg, this chicken salad is one to try. The chicken is thinly sliced with mayo, pickles and egg and hit the spot.  I also tried 'The Gobbler', a turkey sandwich. Now, let me tell you this is not sliced turkey deli meat, rather sliced cooked turkey that is so cute, cut somewhat thck, but fresh and juicy.  I had the \"Gobbler\" with lettuce, tomato cheese and mayo and loved it.  
I also cannot forget to tell you about the Home Made Chips. They are coated in a salt special seasoing sauce and cooked to perfection, perfect for dipping in their soups.

I still have yet to try the Chicken Pot Pie, but that is on my list next.
So happy this place is just down the street and love the large menu variety that seems to accomodate everyone."}
{"text":"One of my fave spots in Charlotte! The coffee is great, as are the breakfast options. They frequently have various specials, and everything I've had is so delicious. 

The ambiance is cozy, and charming. It makes you want to settle in and spend the day with a good book. It's perfect in all seasons- rocking chairs on the porch for summer, and comfy couches beside a fireplace in fall. Honestly, can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food but I did think it was a little on the pricy side considering what it was. It's a cool place to hang out though and great patio area. I got the quiche of the day which was good and the grape salad which is VERY sweet and is way more like a dessert."}
{"text":"I should have done some research before coming. I had heard good things about this restaurant, so I wanted to try it. Unfortunately, I was in the mood for soup, so that's what I had. I didn't realize the restaurant was a full menu of various types of chicken salad! I enjoyed my soup, but I know I missed out. Next time, I'll make sure to order the chicken salad.

I love Mayobird's environment. There are tables inside, but you can also sit on the patio. It was reserved during my visit, but it's a great space."}
{"text":"Love the Mayo Bird, such a unique selection of chicken salads and really good breakfast!
I love knowing it has a story and background of being a food truck first and also a non profit.
Yum Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"We went last sunday.we tried harvest salad sandwich on brioche bread its ok.the staff is very helpful and friendly.  The broccoli side salad is good. I probably be back to second try because i had hear so many good thinks about this place"}
{"text":"The Mayobird is a class of its own.  Think about it.  If I asked you, at any point, what type of food you were in the mood to go out for, what would you say?  Mexican?  Italian?  Pizza? (Yes, there is a difference between Italian and Pizza.)  Thai?  Chinese?  Sushi?  Chicken?  Steak?  I could go on, but chances are you wouldn't immediately default to chicken salad.  Am I right?  It's just not the kind of thing that's top of mind.  The irony here is that once you've experienced The Mayobird, you'll want it regularly!

You'll find The Mayobird amongst the many restaurants on East Blvd.  It shares a building with The Summit Room.  Walk in to find country decor with family style seating and sofas.  Approach the counter to select from a menu boasting more chicken salad variations then you can possibly imagine, and let one of the friendly Mayobird employees know your preference.  From there you'll be given a numbered wooden spoon to place in the spoon holder at the center of each table.  A food runner will bring your delicious chicken salad to you when it's ready.

Chicken salad not in your wheelhouse?  All good.  They offer other options.  Try the pimento cheese.  You won't regret it!  The sides and soups are also amazing.  Oh wait, I can't forget the breakfast!  Grab a cup of coffee, a dessert, whatever you fancy, and tap in to the Wi-Fi as you unwind on the sofa by the fireplace.

This place has just enough southern charm.  It's a great place for breakfast and lunch, but they close at 4pm.  Unless you're over 80, I'd say that rules them out as a dinner option.  I suggest hitting them up on a Saturday in the spring or fall for a couple of to-go sandwiches to enjoy on a blanket at nearby Freedom Park."}
{"text":"The Mayobird is a sandwich shop that offers lots of varieties of chicken salad.  The restaurant has a rustic feel to it, but the environment is pretty nice.  They also offer alcohol, coffee drinks, and coffee drinks with alcohol.

We tried the Harvest and Dill chicken salad sandwich on croissants.  The Dill had a nice flavor, but the Harvest did not taste like much.  The chicken salad was ok, but not remarkable.  The one highlight we had was the broccoli salad.  It was very tasty, and we really enjoyed it.

We had high hopes for this place, but the food left me feeling flat.  Nothing really special here.  The food is not bad, but for the price, the value just isn't there."}
{"text":"If you know me at all, you know my love for chicken salad. So when I came here with a friend I was in love. It is a little overwhelming at first because there's so many different styles of chicken salad to choose from. Don't worry, there are a few other options than chicken salad if you don't want that. The restaurant is attached to The Summit Room. It's cute, lots of character and has a homey feel to it. You could come here and get some work done, eat breakfast, or grab lunch. They also have a coffee/tea bar. I've been here several times and have tried to order something different every time. I've never left disappointed. Definitely a great place to check out if you're in the Dilworth neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything but their athlete salad, mainly because I want to try two different kinds of chicken salad, and overall it's been a pleasant experiment. The counter service has been great, though it's a little awkward when you order to-go during lunch since the line area isn't marked and there's not much room to wait. 

The pita chips with the salad add a nice crunch. The chicken itself is rather finely chopped, so don't expect a lot of texture from the meat unless it's got some tasty add-ins. I would recommend the fruit and nut for a tasty combination with the raspberry vinaigrette."}
{"text":"Chicken Salad never looked so good! This was a great find on Ashley & Liz's part.
I don't know where to start with all of the greatness. 
East Blvd- great location with a parking lot. Outside seating galore! Inside, this place looks like a Pintrest, Shabby-Chic Haven. With warm colors, rustic decor and even a fireplace- I wanted to basically move in. 

Moving on to the best part- Chicken. So many options to choose from. I tried the Greek cs, Liz had the Italian and Buffalo cs. All great options. The broccoli side was oddly good. This was all topped off with fresh, tasty coffee made my Rob. He was clearly the friendliest employee. The other employees didn't seem to be very happy. It didn't ruin my experience, but Rob was notably the kindest worker! Meals run around 8-12 dollars and they also serve breakfast. 

I will be coming back for sure!"}
