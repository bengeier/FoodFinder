{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get an opportunity to try their smoothies. I asked the two employees if either of their proteins (whey and pea) were gluten free. Neither knew, but said they would check. One checked on a printed nutrition guide and the other checked \"in the back\". Both came back saying \"it doesn't say. I don't think they are\". Disappointing!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time visiting. The only time I remember having a good customer experience was the first time I came. It took forever as there was only one employee making several but at least she acknowledged us as soon as we walked in. These last three times they don't even say \"hi\" and today even despite me saying \"hello\" she ignored me and waited until she was done making and handing out smoothie before even acknowledging me. The previous time the employee in booty shorts was on the phone with what sounded like a personal call laughing and again didn't acknowledge me and my daughter coming in it wasn't until she finished her call that she took my order. GREAT smoothies, poor customer service skills all around so lame."}
{"text":"Very nice place for a very flavorful healthy drink. This place is just amazing. 

The staff is very friendly and the place is extra clean. The prices are extremely nice."}
{"text":"This place is mildly expensive and they don't really have tons of options for smoothie bowls. The employee was rather flat and didn't seem to like her job at all. Smoothie bowl was really good, just expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"The acai bowls are smaller than what we are use to in Hawaii, but I love the fact that we can add extras just like our favorite place back home.....also CUSTOMER SERVICE is always a plus in my book!!! Mahalo to the Asst. Mgr Anisa for the excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened by Avondale!. Smoothies are reasonably priced. They have healthier versions and the staff is very friendly.. I ordered the grape ape and it was yummy. Will definitely go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Seen this place open up a few weeks ago. Swung by tonight. Great lil place. Awesome, friendly customer service. Very clean. Had the mango Peach banana sherbert and man I'm glad I got it it was great. 5*"}
{"text":"Got an acai bowl and it was super filling and delicious!  They have so many options and sizes you'll definitely find something you like. Also they have lots of yummy vegan snacks in the front which i have yet try!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect this place to be so nice and comfortable. Most smoothie places are a grab n go but when you go to planet smoothie you actually want to sit and enjoy it. Plus the service was so nice! Really patient and genuinely kind. I had a protein strawberry smoothie and it was delicious! I had a small and I'm totally getting a large next time and I'm really looking forward to trying their bowls! The only downside is that it is a bit pricey in my opinion BUT totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Almost didn't go here because I looked up near by to see a review on this place and saw crap pics of crap smoothies so I drove away then realized by the sign it was plant smoothie and not smoothing king.(smoothie king has crap pics ). This place has expensive drinks but I'm rich b*tch so I got the most expensive one. The lady was dragging her feet to check me out so I timed her to make my smoothie and a line started to form and It took her 8 mins to put all the junk in the smoothie and give it to me. Her name was like lattisha or something."}
{"text":"So I'm currently waiting until 9am for it to open and I can literally see a drink on one table and the chairs still on the tables and the one worker here has been standing at the door staring at me the last 20 minutes I have been here. I will absolutely not come here knowing nobody is making an effort to fully clean in the mornings and just sit around."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a variety of tasty smoothies. They are separated into categories like light, portein, energy, etc. I'll probably visit regularly because the location is next to my usual Fry's."}
{"text":"So far so good! Keep up the great customer! The greeting as I walked in was unexpected. The genuine service from the young ladies behind the counter was superb. It's always a refreshing experience to walk into a place where they actually provide you with outstanding customer service. I love that I was able to customize my smoothie with no issues! I got a lite (16oz) Strawberry, banana smoothie with just almond milk, whey protein and PB2!! I also got a kid smoothie for my son who was with me and he absolutely enjoyed it! I signed up for their loyalty program because I know I will definitely be back! Tropical Smoothie Cafe across the street has some competition on their hands especially because their customer service is very poor."}
