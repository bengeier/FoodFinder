{"text":"Their food is delicious, and really affordable too. The portions are generous, as it tends to be served famly style."}
{"text":"Amazing top notch Korean food! Definitely one of the best places in AZ. They're usually extremely busy, but it's worth the wait for the taste. Only downside is having to waive down the servers. You usually only seem them twice. When they take your order and when they're handing the bill. They rarely ever come around to check up on you or refill your drinks. Besides that a must place to come eat at."}
{"text":"Food is good, but they are VERY VERY stingy about the side dishes.  They refused to give you the side dishes before your meal and once, they told me they ran out, when CLEARLY they didn't as they were serving it to other tables.  I would rather go to Takamatsu or Banchan.  Very bad service."}
{"text":"The food is not even that good here, my favorite dish is galbi. For the same price, you can get way better food and service elsewhere.   Service: 2/5 Food: 3/5 Price/Value: 2/5 Ambience: 2/5"}
{"text":"So we decided to try out Korean food in Arizona, and this place had the best reviews, it seemed. I ordered mul-neng-myun, while my husband ordered bi-bim-neng-myun. We received a decent amount of banchan, but the weirdest one was coleslaw. I have never seen coleslaw as banchan at a Korean restaurant before.  The barley tea was weak, but they iced it for the hot Phoenix evening, so it was refreshing. My husband enjoyed his bibimnengmyun, but he was disappointed that it wasn't as spicy as he expected it to be. Perhaps they reduced the spice level for Arizonans, or maybe they were from a region of Korea that eats milder food. My mul-neng-myun was very good. I had no complaints. It was what I expected.  The banchan was just OK. The kimchee wasn't as good as what I expect in California, but my husband liked the sliced tofu. The coleslaw was surprisingly good, but strange as banchan in a Korean restaurant. The soy-marinated potatoes and the radish kimchee was OK.  Service was excellent. Our server checked in on us several times and gave us coffee candy with our dinner check. I would rather have cut up fruit like watermelon or orange slices, but I'll take candy over the Korean gum that some Korean restaurants leave with the bill. This place looked almost as busy as the Hodori Restaurant in Koreatown (LA). No relationship to the Koreatown restaurant, though. Hodori is the name of the official mascot of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The full name of the mascot is Hodori Horangi (Hodori, the Tiger)."}
{"text":"What can I say about Hodori, I love it, I'm annoyed, then I love it. I been coming here for a long time and it's time for a review.  Everyone knows that the service is not the BEST BUT the yummy food is what keeps me coming back. I even stop coming for a while because the service irritated me so much but here I am back. I have notice the service is so much better. You gotta know that this place is BUSY.....and that there are usually 2 or 3 servers for the whole restaurant so make sure your not in a rush or you will not enjoy your food. We usually get the tofu soup (spicy w/ egg) and lunch special spicy pork, lettuce wraps and go to town. My first bite makes me do a butt chair dance cause it's that good. So find out what makes you dance. ; ) Happy dancing !!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo yummy!!! I love their kalbi it's the bomb and they give u a lot but it's expensive. About twenty dollars for that plate but it comes w rice and all the side dishes. If u want tofu soup then this is the best place to go in AZ cuz they have great variety w the cheapest prices. It's cheaper than chodang in Chandler and comes w more tofu too. I Really enjoy this place but don't come often cuz of the price. Their lunch specials are great though from 11-1 I think it's half off for Korean bbq but only on weekdays."}
{"text":"I love their tofu soup. I always get the seafood tofu soup. Korean pancakes (Pajeon, spell?) is really good too."}
{"text":"Loved the food..I had the spicy seafood soup..delicious..served hot and really hit the spot. I will definitely eat here again plus I recommend it to everyone.  Our waiter was nice and very helpful."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. The prices and the meal sizes are tolerable. Dinner prices, however, are on the high side, and I'm always sad when the portions are only slightly larger than the lunch at twice the price. I normally get the BBQ pork. It's a bit on the sweet side, but not so much that I can't stand it. The kimchee varies from day to day. They're always bright and refreshing. I started getting addicted to those little salty fishes and then they ran out.  The hotpot (I can't remember the Korean equivalent) for two was disappointing. It was a small portion and was mostly vermicelli with hardly and meat. I have to give this place 4 stars because of the limited options in the area and the great lunch deals. Also, as an aside, I've seen a number of baseball players in here during the cactus leagues."}
{"text":"\"yummy, authentic, local Korean restaurant!\" - 4/5   We were so happy when we found out about Hodori. Since I was first introduced by my Korean friend Kristy to Hodori, I have been dragging J there for at least 4 times now.   We always ordered spicy tofu + seafood soup, seafood pancake, bulgolgi beef and jap chae when we were there. The service is fast and good. Even though the price is a bit higher but it is worth the price. You won't be too disappointed with Hidori!"}
{"text":"Food is authentic but hit or miss with the flavor. Staff are friendly and I can tell they are working very hard. I went there with a couple friend's and their friends on the day classes were cancelled due to rain, and I sincerely apologize for their behavior. At one point one of them yelled across the restaurant at the cooks saying he wanted ice cream, (oh my goodness, I am so sorry, that was very embarrassing)... I saw them advertising seafood pancakes last time I was there and plan to go back to try it since I really like seafood pancakes."}
{"text":"Though I think their service can improve a bit, their food is delicious for sure. What haven't I tried there? The Tofu pot was still boiling when it's served to you. The seafood pancake was crispy with loaded toppings, and the spicy octopus with veggie was flavored just right.  Will go there periodically when craving Korean and don't want to go too far."}
{"text":"I think their food is decent and appropriately priced. As in, their food is not cheap, but not crappy either. I never had a problem with service or the food."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get hot Korean tofu soup in the winter ... the tofu was oh so silky that it literally just slide down your throat ... though the spice can kick it up a bit As for the other dishes, barbeque meat is usual .... not the best but decent .... the hot stone rice was good too ....   They have happy hours with seafood pancake for ~$6 (normal ~$15 I think) that I yet to try  ... overall a good place for winter comfort"}
{"text":"I love Korean food and this is the place to get it. Always good food, generous portions. The staff are courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"I really love their nakji dol sot, which is their octopus dish. But the service sucks and they lie. You ask for another serving of banchan, they tell you they ran out. Then you see them serving it to others. What? If I'm desperate for that dish, I may go back..but I will avoid it if I can. I prefer takamatsu's service. SO MUCH better. They don't 'run out' of side dishes and actually offer to give you more. AND they don't nickel and dime you for extra rice for your kids."}
{"text":"I was craving tofu soup one night so I checked this place out based on all the positive reviews.  The tofu was soft and flavorful.  Several other tables ordered their BBQ meats, which also looked/smelled good.  The side dishes were OK but not as many options as other Korean restaurants I have been to.  They have the basics - kimchee, cucumber, radish, sprouts.  Overall, the food was better than I expected for a place in Phoenix.  Now to the bad: the service was absolutely atrocious, if you can call that service at all.  It is a sign of bad service when every table in the restaurant is looking around for someone to help them.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and take our order.  Another 40 minutes for the food.  The side dishes come with the entrees so don't count on them when you are starving.  The tofu came without rice, which took another 10 minutes.  All this time, you have to flag the waiters multiple times if you want a refill of water or anything else.  Even when they make eye contact, they ignore you.  People actually left their tables to go to the service area and help themselves!  There were no apologies from the waiters for the wait.  They did not even smile.  The very worst part of the meal was paying.  Naturally, we were not able to get our checks at the table, so we lined up at the cashiers table behind another group.  (Keep in mind there is no cashier so we had to wait for a waiter to decide we were worth his time of day.)  When it came our turn to pay, the waiter blew right past us without help us!  Luckily, another waiter finally saw us and got us our check.  I wish we could have given him all the tip.  This may be the only Korean place in Phoenix, but I will hold out for when I go to LA.  Even if they have unfriendly service, at least they are efficient."}
{"text":"Got soft tofu soup. They mixed up our order. My bf thought his soup was bland while I was burning up and breathing fire lol. The food was mediocre, aside from the mix-up. Priced a lot higher than what its worth. Small portions."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my husband, we were greeted as soon as we entered and shown to a table. Restaurant was very clean, and smelled amazing.   Our server quickly got our drink order, and handed us menus. I ordered Nakji Bokum it was delicious and perfectly spicy the only negative was the octopus was a little chewy. But this did not take any away from the dish. My husband ordered the pork belly it came to the table sizzling away and was cut into smaller pieces. The pork came with a few sauces and fixings like garlic and jalapeño. The pork was very tasty and not at all fatty.   The banchon was great my favorite being the cucumber and fish cake. Had a very nice meal."}
{"text":"To the owner: train your waiters to take orders. Been here three times and every time takes waiters 10-15 min just to come and take orders. They see that menu is closed and we're just waiting. Looking back directly at three other servers as they just stand around talking.  You have to assign systems. Can't be all random. Assign table sections to each server, like every good restaurant does.   Either get competent servers or stop letting high school kids work at your place. Food is just average, but hard to come by good Korean let alone Asian food in Arizona."}
{"text":"The quality of food went down big time. Last three times I went there with friends I got OK food. it was not worth driving that far or spending monies. It was kinda pricy with OK food. I rather go to Paldo for $7 noodles."}
{"text":"Korean foods are very interesting to have a try. I heard from friends here have traditional Korean foods. But I am sure is it real, at least taste is okay.. It's spicy... If u like spicy taste, here maybe is a good choice."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!!  Great service, great food, great prices.  Definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Ohhh, how I miss this place! Moved almost 4 years ago and go back to visit every year and make a special stop! The Dawgee Bolgoki and the Kalbee always call us home. When we first starting coming the owners would hand us pictures to see what we wanted. Then the \"English\" menu came out and we learned what it is was that we were ordering. I love Hadori's. The kids always called it the \"Kitty Kat place\" due to the tigers painted on the windows. If you like Korean or want to try you must stop here!"}
{"text":"I have tried several Korean restaurants around ASU and Mesa, and I have been here twice. This one is definitely the best and I would love to come here again. We had the tofu soup and the bi bim bop this time and both were perfect!"}
{"text":"Out of all the korean restaurants in AZ I've tried so far this is definitely my fav.. just recently moved from nyc.. food reminds me of back home.. love this place.."}
{"text":"A solid addition to the few Korean restaurants in the Phoenix area.  My usual dish at Korean restaurants is Kimchi soon dubu (tofu soup).  A spicy, sour mix of tastiness.  Hodori's version doesn't disappoint.  The nearest competitor (IMHO) is Chodang in Chandler, and I think the dishes here are comparable.  BiBimBop is adequate here.  It seems somewhat lacking in flavor compared to the better BiBimBop I've had in the past, but passable.  We also had the daeji bulgogi (BBQ pork).  Pretty good, but again not spectacular.  The meat slices were somewhat chunky and fatty and the flavor had slightly more american BBQ taste than I'm used to.   Slightly off, but still acceptable and worth a try.  The service here was great!  Prompt and friendly.  Refilled drinks quickly.  Unusual positive for a korean restaurant.  Price is slightly high but not unexpectedly so.  Would go back if in the area, though I admittedly have a slight preference for Chodang."}
{"text":"Best cucumbers in town! Not always the best service, but the food is great. Try the tofu soup, bibimbap, and kalbi. They won't disappoint."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here and when we walked in,the male waiter appeared pretty nice and told us to choose a table and sit down. He followed us to our table and handed us the menu, so we thought so far so good. Then 5,10 and 15 minutes went by and we were left alone,it appeared both the waiter and entire place forgot that we were there...they totally IGNORED us. I saw the male waiter that had helped us earlier glanced over our table a few times,but NO SERVICE what so ever. The service here was TERRIBLE, most of the employees were pretty RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL towards us. The funny thing was that the table of 5 koreans that came in way after us had their orders taken down way before us. I will NEVER,EVER come back to this hate-ful and ill-mannered restaurant ever again. Not only was the service HORRIBLE,but the atmosphere and korean waiters were too RUDE and ill-mannered,they didn't deserve our business. So we went to the Hong Kong restaurant right near it,and the Chinese waitress there were 100x nicer and better educated than those korean waiters."}
{"text":"Food and service are exceptional! Would recommend to anyone looking for traditional Korean food and the warm hospitality of their culture. Definitely a repeat"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming here for over 6 years. It is our go-to Korean restaurant. The good is authentic, fresh, and the restaurant is always clean if understaffed. Staff are always very friendly and well groomed. The fried mandu are especially better than anywhere else I've been."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. Everything tastes fresh. By far the best korean food in town. Their famous dish is the tofu soup."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant that I know of in Az. I live in the west valley, and never realized how much I would miss this place when I moved. Whenever I am in the mood for good Korean food, I make the drive to Mesa. It's definitely worth it! The lunch specials are awesome, especially the Hodori special lunch plate. It has BBQ chicken, beef and spicy pork...you can't go wrong with a little bit of everything. I also like the Yuk Gae Jang for when I feel like hot and spicy soup."}
{"text":"My family and I have become regulars at this restaurant and its definitely one of our favorite Korean restaurants, located conveniently so we can also do some grocery shopping next door.  The food is delicious and the servers are always so friendly and accommodating to my family who is vegetarian, willing to point out to us what is or isn't vegetarian-friendly and making the soup water-based instead of their normal beef broth. They recently added cheese to the kimchi fried rice which I felt was a bonus!  Will definitely be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"$20 Bulgolgi was dry, cold, tasteless and onion was raw. They forgot to heat up the cast iron plate.  $16 Spicy Octopus was like chewy rubber and totally inedible.  Very very dissatisfied with the dinner experience.  First and last time to eat here.    There are better Korean restaurants around."}
{"text":"Best Korean place in the area. I suggest you try the menu as most will not disappoint. My favorite is the nakji bokum. The staff is friendly and try really hard to please. I would visit this place again when I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Went there and have lunch with colleague.  I have no expectation before going there as no one tell me whether it is good or not.  I ordered a lunch special with BBQ meats, it is reasonably priced. Oh my god, by the time you start tasting the food, you will know that this is real Korean food you are tasting!  It is so delicious that you can't resist.  I am not very hungry but I still can finish my whole plate of food."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Korean food.  Ambience could be better, but the food is okay and the service is fast."}
{"text":"food is good but doesn't feel right well due to the servers. won't be going back for a while as all the services are fair but very much slow to refill  side dishes. seems they are frugal to save them. However, other than that, kimchi stew and tofu foods are delicious!"}
{"text":"I've tried few korean restaurants here in phoenix. but this place probably has more of my flavors than any other. even with their extensive choices of their soon tofu hot pot, it wasn't as good as it is in LA. their rice dishes and summer specials are good, from traditional stone pot bibimbap to cold noodle soups. I also enjoyed their bulgogis... but found that pork one was too sweet for my taste bud. one of my favorites were korean sausage soup with pork innards, oyster, pork and nappa cabbage plate with radish kinchi, and monk fish braised in spicy sauce. I would not recommend fermented soybean paste stew. I found that meat was too gritty."}
{"text":"We used to go there whenever we need to stop by Asiana Market. Side dishes are not fresh. Even main dish is lacking ingredients and no taste. Service was so bad - I speak Korean  - I requested sunny side egg to be put in my dosotbibimbab and the staff came back said the cook doesn't understand what that is. When they had a picture of it hanging in the restaurant. very expensive and not worthy it if you are looking for good Korean food - very disappointing."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to enjoy Korean tofu soup & Seafood pancake!"}
{"text":"The Food is ok.  It is not easy to get the waitress's attention.  The most terrible part is we saw a cockroach crawling on the wall next to our table."}
{"text":"Crazy place never ever had before. sever is stupid, only one sever. Also food is tasting so bad. Won't come here again. Not real Korea store"}
{"text":"I love Korean food so much that I probably was Korean in my former life!  This restaurant has never disappointed me.  They always greet my family when we come in.  They serve more banchan when the kids are with me, and that's a good thing because they love their veggies and kim chi.  Seafood panjeon is always a must, it's the kids' favorite item besides the bulgogi.  It's huge so we always have leftovers to take home.  We always get their spicy pork too."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Korean restaurants in greater Phoenix area. I'm from LA so it does not reach par, but not bad at all! Sometimes the service is slow, but overall the food is pretty good!! Their traditional Bulgogi (the one that comes with soup in it and glass noodles) is my go-to! Their army soup and bossam are also in point!"}
{"text":"Went to this place as we were passing through Phoenix on our way back to California. I must say I was very impressed, not only with the food but also by the service. We got two orders of Neng Myun, an order of Kalbi, and two OB's. I heard this place is really known for their Soon Tofu, but it was 114 degrees outside so we decided to pass. The dude taking our order was really attentive, nice, and buff. If you're looking for a white table cloth joint, this is not the place for you. It looks like a gutted Mexican restaurant. The place is pretty big with a lot of open space so definitely good for the kids."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I stop by for lunch whenever I come up to Phoenix from Tucson.  Their soft tofu soups are so delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow. Food was okay. Korean restaurants in az is horrendous. Gogi food was much better"}
{"text":"My family go to this place all the time, and today it really deserves a 2 star.  Every time we go there, we ask for more \"potato side dish\" when we finish it.  For the past 2 times, plus this time again, we ask them for more side dish, they would take the dish away and never come back.  We have to go ask the lady for the side dish that they took away.  Then they said they don't have any more of such such such and will give us kimchi instead.  Same thing for today.  We asked for more potato side dish, the lady took the dish away but never came back, for about 10 mins.  My 4 year old daughter really likes it and that's the only thing she will eat.  She was waiting for it but they did not bring it bck.  I told her to go ask the lady.  So she did.  The lady told her they have no more potato.    But they are constantly busy, bringing out food to other tables.  But every cart is full of those side dish and the potatoes were there.  Every table that they bring out.  So why did they tell us there is no more potato?  What???  Pissed me off.  We ordered the seafood pancake but the flour mix was not cooked all the way. Just a bad day today."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is so friendly and the food is amazing!! Spicy Chicken bulgogi is amazing"}
{"text":"I am no expert on Korean food, and I will never be. Oxknee soup? How does one eat an animal's knee? Huh?  Whatever. What I had was wonderful. I had beef in very hot, boiling broth with cabbage and carrots. Also had pork, which was more flavorful than I was expecting.  There's several items on the menu that was completely alien to me, so I cannot vouch for the more exotic items they offer.   But if you like Korean, and/or want to try something new (and really good!), then check this place out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. It is our friends' favorite and they took us here. We had spicy pork bbq, veggie Bibim bap, and a variety of other dishes. We will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place, tried the food once and then that's all I needed! The food has such savory taste, slightly pricey for a normal Korean restaurant but it is definitely worth it! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is the best food we have had in Phoenix! The service, flavor, and quality are excellent. The food comes out fast and is not expensive. Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"I have been craving Korean food for the longest time and happened upon this place by accident. I'm so glad I did! The spicy BBQ pork with the assortment of kimchi and veggies on the side were amazing! I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I'm giving Hodori a 4 mainly for the food, not the service. Sometimes they do good, other times I'm sitting there just waiting for a menu. I know I'll keep coming back because I love the food however! Must try the spicy beef and mushroom tofu soup, the Kalbi BBQ ribs and even the potstickers are great!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Korean BBQ. It was delicious and filling. Decent Korean music playing and a peaceful atmosphere. Very understanding of our mispronunciation."}
{"text":"Came in on a quiet night in the mood for soon dobu.  It's decent, but not LA standards."}
{"text":"The food was good, and it's one of the few real Korean places in the Phoenix Metro area, but the service was what ruined my meal here. As expected, my group and I were put in the \"white person\" area away from the main floor. And we had to wait 15 minutes to even be asked for water. It was great food, third to only Las Vegas and Orange County. Would I come back here? Probably, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"This was great service! Food was delicious. I got octopus stir fry and I loved it (I don't usually eat Korean food and still loved it). I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times.  The service is always less than welcoming. I keep going back because its the only Korean place I have found in the Phoenix/Mesa area.  So I compromise in the service and price department. Plus the food has always been a hit or miss.  The only constant thing I have enjoyed is the Kimchi Pancakes. Overall, a gamble on good Korean food is better than no Korean food ..... I guess. But today in the bibimbap we found HAIR. I really wish this place had great service and good quality food I could count on. When the food is good, its good! But sadly due to the service, the hair, and the high price I may not be returning again."}
{"text":"Okay, we gave this place three chances, and each time the service got worse.each time took over an hour for our order (and they weren't busy any of the times). The last time we were there, after ordering the seafood pancake, 25 minutes later they tell us that the health inspector is there and they can't make it for us because they shut down a part of their kitchen. You want good Korean food? Don't go here."}
{"text":"A really diverse and interesting menu - everything was tasy!  Large portions and fast service with frequent refills of kimchi and sides.  If you want boba afterwards from the place next door, be aware it closes at 8 during the week!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Korean food in the valley,  never had a bad meal here and this is our 10 th visit!"}
{"text":"We had the mackerel and the short ribs.  Both were very good.  The Banchan that came with it was also very good; it consisted of kimchee, spicy cucumber, hardboiled egg in a sweet soy sauce, bean sprouts in a vinegar sauce, boiled potatoes in a sweet soy sauce, and spinach.    The restaurant itself is pleasant and casual with no music (yeah!).  My only complaint were the utensils.  We were given very thin metal chopsticks and a spoon.  The thin metal chopsticks were hard to hold and metal of course is slippery.    The service was friendly and reasonably attentive.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nestled in Mesa, Hodori was a great find for solid Korean food! My friends and I ordered the Bulkogi(Korean BBQ), Tonkatsu, and Dumplings! Man were we amazed the sauce lathered on the pork Tonkatsu was delicious with the egg salad and cole slaw! The pork was breaded to perfection and served like a fancy restaurant style etiquette! The dumplings were great in soup with the yummy rice cakes which were moist and chewy, a pleasant delight! The main attraction the Bulkogi was great with the rice and Kimchi/other side dishes served! Also, the server was delightful and so attentive and caring. My friend had dropped his chopstick and the waiter noticed and brought him a new set in seconds! Great location too near Asiana Market, Chinese food nearby and other Asian food eateries in the vicinity. Glad I found this treasure in Mesa, due to the lack of many quality Asian restaurants! I will definitely be back and plan to further taste the other awesome choices on the menu!  Service 5/5  Food 5/5  Courteousness 5/5  Waiting time 5/5  Ambiance 5/5"}
{"text":"Came here at least once a month for several months. Best Korean BBQ in phoenix. Service was slow half the time but not a big deal.  Having worked at a few Asian restaurants, Chinese\Korean first generation wait staff is generally speaking slower and less attentive than their western counterparts. A few years ago they served you after all the Korean people if you brought black or white friends with you. Sort of funny I guess and not a big deal as they eventually resolved that issue. However, I had to stop going because the older waitresses were consistently rude to my non-Korean guests. We weren't loud, and I tipped 20-25% every time we went there but it got annoying. Anyways, would be five stars but drop to 3 for hiring rude wait staff."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 1 PM on Saturday and the place was almost full. Got a loud Korean greeting from entire staff when we entered. Got seated within a minute. The food arrived fast on service carts, too hot to carry out by hand. My Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) was 2 pieces of pork and came with all the side dishes. Everything we ordered was great. Even though the restaurant was busy,service was attentive and friendly. I've found my new favorite Korean restaurant in Mesa AZ. Oh...also got a loud Korean 'Thank You!' from the staff when we left, I can't remember the last time that's happened at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.   This is the Korean restaurant of my dreams. This review will be solely based on the food, and not the service.   Instead of water, they serve you Korean Bori Cha. Bori cha is only served in the summer, and it's an non sweetened ice tea. I haven't had bori cha in about 15 yrs. Most Korean restaurants don't brew it (to serve to patrons).   I was really impressed by that.   They also serve Raw Crab Marinade(Kye JJang), which I'd been craving for a very long time. This is  also a dish you're unlikely to get at other Korean restaurants. It was legit. For someone who was raised on Korean food, but doesn't get it often enough, I was so happy I could have cried. It was well balanced, spicy, and just out of this world.   My bibim naengmyung was sooo good. I was already sold by the other stuff, but the naengmyung was the cherry on top. It was just like homemade. Their side dishes were generous. We got tofu with soy sauce/chives on top, steamed broccoli, soy bean sprouts, kimchee (which was really delectable), pickled cucumbers, and braised potato.   We also got the fried gyoza. Normally, these are pre-made from the Korean store. Not at this restaurant; you could tell someone's grandma made these. Instead of the standard 6, we got about 10 of them. The dipping sauce was light.  I live 30 min away, but this place was definitely worth the drive. There were a lot of Korean people in there which told me this place was the place to be."}
{"text":"We've been going here for several years and consistently enjoyed it.  The servers are terrific, and so is the food.  Their fried dumplings are especially good, as is the soft tofu stew and any of the grilled meat.  The price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food okay only. We ordered spicy tofu soup. Opt for the extra spicy and it did not even taste spicy. The bulgogi beef is not hot when it arrive. Not sizzling at all."}
{"text":"So I've been to this restaurant 3 times just to make sure it wasn't me that was being rude or a jerk.   So to start off the food is just ok, nothing too spectacular but not bad, but the pricing is high for the things here, I can get it at any other Korean restaurant for way less.  So here's is why I gave the place a one star.... The service it's not nonexistent it's pure rude like I borrowed money from them and didn't pay them back!! So every time I ask them about any dish on the menu they look at me like I was crazy, like I was from another planet or something for not knowing what I was asking about was. One time I was there for lunch at 2:30 or so with a buddy of mine and I asked them if I could order the happy hour dishes that starts at 3 and naturally they said no which was understandable so we order and started to eat til 2:57 when I asked again to get something from the happy hour menu the waitress looked at me with a look the a mom would give to her child when he did something bad and replied it's not 3 at that point I wanted to het up and leave  but my buddy said wait and at least finish lunch, ok I finished stood up and asked our waitress for a togo box from behinds the counter she the replied \"for what?\"....I was so done with this place told me buddy to pay and stormed out   So for all you awesome people that read the my whole rant thank you and those who didn't.....well I STRONGLY would not recommend this place to eat maybe to get pissed off at but other then that yeah that's my two cent."}
{"text":"I really love korean food. I ordered a bunch of things last night. I had ordered a vegetarian soon tofu soup with everything in it (seaweed, mushrooms, and kimchee) and eveything else ordered was shared with my friend except the soup. Although my friend tasted the soup and thought it diddint taste fresh. Towards the end of dinner, around 9:15, I began to feel suddenly ill. I went to the bathroom and threw up violently and painfully. :( Went out, and went back to throw up. Struggled to walk out of there, I threw up multiple times on the way home. By midnight I was hyperventilating, in extreme pain everywhere, and could not walk. I called my friend who was just with me to take me to the emergency room. I considered calling an ambulence. :( I truly felt like I was going to die.  My friend found me on bathroom floor. Rushed me to hospital. In the hospital, I blacked out a few times, saw the light, as they rushed to attend to me. I couldn't talk, walk, or function. I had severe food poisoning.  I had chills, sweats, shakes, and feeling hot and cold. Absolute worst feeling in the world. They immediately gave me fluids, nausea meds, and morphine for pain. I was there untill 3:30. My feeling is that soup was bad. It diddnt taste right to begin with, nor did it look right. Also, considering it was a veggie broth, I wonder if because it may be something the Asians there NEVER order (perhaps), they probably had a batch that went wrong, or... maybe something else in the soup wasint right. Lastly, the soup is usually super boiling hot. I felt like it wasint, cause my egg diddint cook right away as usual. Maybe it was the egg from samonila poisening. I'm going to talk to the manager, I want a full refund.  This has been the most traumatic health issue I've ever felt, and certainly the worst case of food poisoning I have ever had. :(  Update: Sean the owner helped to get me a full refund. And I expressed that I would like to give this place another chance without getting sick. He also gave me a gift card for future use. Thank you Sean."}
{"text":"Their dishes are pretty decent.  You don't leave smelling too much like Korean bbq (you know what I'm talking about) because you don't grill the meats yourself.  If you're like me and prefer to grill at your table, it's kind of a bummer, but it's no biggie.  The servers are pretty attentive and are quick to refill your drinks, get you more side dishes (yes, you can ask for more kimchi, bean sprouts or what have you), etc.  The main reason why I come here is to have their ar sundubu (fish roe tofu soup).  There is nothing better after a great (or awful :P) night of drinking.  Ar sundubu w/ an egg on top (or substitute with another sundubu if you don't like fish roe) A bowl of rice Cold barley tea (boricha)  Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and the spicy pork bulgogi is just as amazing every time! The service is very friendly and the food comes out in a very timely matter. They also make sure your water is always full which is a huge thing for me! I always go with the spicy pork bulgogi but I also tried to kimchi fried rice tonight and it was good but lacked flavor, the fried egg on top was delicious however..."}
{"text":"This place is the most authentic Korean place in Phoenix! All the food is spectacular and I will most definitely be coming back. The food is cooked quickly and there isn't that much of a wait. It's worth 49 min drive"}
{"text":"EDIT: So we went back a second time because even though I wasn't very impressed the first time, my boyfriend loved it, so we met some friends for dinner and I gave it another try. And now that I've actually found something great that I really like - a rather filling soup with beef broth, dumplings, and rice cakes - I have to bump up my review from 3 stars to 4. Having something that I enjoyed eating definitely improved the experience this time!  ---------------------------------------------  I'm not very knowledgeable about Korean food and had never been to a restaurant like this before, but it's close by to where we live and my boyfriend wanted to try it.  Immediately I noticed that most of the menu items had the little red pepper next to it indicating it was spicy. I'm a bit of a pansy when it comes to spicy food, so it was unfortunate that automatically ruled out the majority of the menu for me. I ordered the Bibim Bap, which was essentially a large bowl of cold vegetables with a little meat and a fried egg on top and a side of rice - not bad, but if I'd known the dish didn't have much substance to it I probably would've ordered something else. My boyfriend ordered the Nakji Dol Pan, which was basically octopus and vegetables on a sizzling stone plate with rice. He let me try a bite of octopus without the spicy sauce on it, and while I thought it was a bit chewy he still enjoyed it.  The service was pleasant and accommodating, and our waiter was glad to answer any questions we had about the menu. Definitely no complaints there.  Overall I didn't have a bad experience at Hodori, it just wasn't fantastic. We'll probably be back eventually, and I'll try something else on the menu that will hopefully be more to my liking."}
{"text":"The food is food. No complaints there.  However, the service is very SLOW.  So, if you have quite a lot of extra time to kill I would eat here.  In our case we had a kimchi pancake but took 40 min to get our soup. And they really weren't that busy.  If they improve service they could score higher."}
{"text":"While having dinner, a small roach was found crawling on the side of a main dish plate and then on top of the table surface. A server killed the thing with a tissue directly off from the table and took it back to show it to the manager. Manager didn't come immediately to remedy the situation but took  time to come. He brought our check and apologized saying that he will give us a 20% discount! I couldn't believe what he was offering. Who knows where the roach was before I spotted it on the plate! He asked me if it was a small roach or a big roach. I don't know why that even matters. He was more about justifying himself rather than taking care of the customer. It took some complaints from my end to get it to 50% discount. Later, I was still bothered by it and I told this experience to a friend. He called the manager asking for a full refund of the meal. The manager tried to justify by saying things like they didn't see a roach on the table...it was on the floor...it was actually an ant not a roach...he even took a picture of it.... I mean seriously??? Why would he lie like that?? I wasn't going to write this kind of review but after hearing from my friend how the manager distorted the facts of what had actually happened, I decided to post for the manager to see how his actions have resulted in huge disappointments. I really hope the restaurant takes this post seriously and take proactive changes to the current restaurant condition and BETTER customer service."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed been coming here for years spicy pork and pork tofu soup are my most favorite dishes there."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, without a doubt. We had the spicy bulgogi, samgyupsal, kimchi fried rice, and a type of soup (which i can't remember). Everything is served hot and fresh, or at least it all tastes like it. The sides are endless and the servers refill it as soon they see the containers emptying. Be aware, however, that the rice is just one little bowl and you have to ration it till the end of the meal. Not all dishes come with rice. My complaint here is that when I went with a group of friends, two of us ordered the kimchi fried rice. When the food was served, my bowl contained rice that didn't even come to the half-way mark. On the other hand, my friend's bowl was heaping. Yeah, it may sound petty, but when I pay $10 for a dish, I want it to fill me up or at least be sufficient. I brought it up with our server and all she said was they made it together in one pot and just added it to the bowls and they wouldn't give me more. Needless to say, I left there not even content. I finished my rice in about 3 or 4 bites. Other than that, it's a fantastic place."}
{"text":"For starters:I am an american that grew up in a very korean dense population. My best highs chool girl riend's family ran the best Korean restuarant in town so i am a bit spoiled.  That being said, I hadn't had any korean food in about 5 years, I started having cravings that wouldn't go away. Bulgogi and kimchee are my favorites. I suggested Korean food for a date one night.  Atmosphere: Was fine,very casual nothing to write home about american family resturant style. I had REALLY hoped for table top cooking because I think it is just more fun that way. makes things more festive. I also like a bit more traditional korean decor.  Service: I had a Teenage Korean American girl who spoke perfect english and was polite but not very attentive. She looked like she hated her after school job.  Food: It was good but not great. We both ordered Bulgogi Which came in HUGE piles on sizzling plates witha layer of White onion underneath.the flavor was good but it was bit dry. The Side dishes were excllentt, I loved the Kimchee(the white radish and cabbage),potatoes and the sprout salad. Yummy.  Wine: First time I had korean wine at all. We chose the rice wine that came in a wooden bown. We both loved this. My date is Indian and they have a regional drink that is identical he was so excited when he realized. It was sweet mild and I really liked it  Overall, I liked the place and would definitely go back. We are trying a new Korean Place tonight so I am interested to see how they match up."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I'm surprised at all the great reviews??? I come from SF where the food choices are abundant for some authentic whatever you want cuisine. First came the japchae ....the mere appearance looked sad... there was no sweetness whatsoever. Then came the bulgogi and the chicken bulgogi.. they both tasted very bland and the flavor wasn't quite there. Banchan was just blah... remembering this meal makes me wanna ask for a refund. Goodbye $52.50....."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Good prices, good portions. Good service. Friendly, family-owned atmosphere."}
{"text":"We are new to Town. Found this awesome korean restaurant on Yelp. I gotta say this plc is amazing.  Everything look so delicious on the menu.  Luv it! Great customer service"}
{"text":"Simply awesome!  We come here all the time and love this place. My wife is Ty and I am American but this is honestly our favorite Korean place in the whole city"}
{"text":"Moving away from the Meca of KBBQ in Ktown, Los Angeles, I was on the prowl to find some good KBBQ. The sides were alright and taste \"standard.\" nothing special here. I tried their bulgogi & their beef tofu soup and will say it was yummy and satisfying. I don't think I'll be back especially seeing how pricey their food was (tofu soup was the only reasonably priced item). Thumbs up, but whatevers...."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I've gone here on several occasions so I've tried a variety of dishes. The sides are great. I've had their bulgogi, bibimbap, a hot soup (can't remember the name), and a cold noodle dish (it was spicy and sweet) - all were delicious. Service is slow, but the boys are polite - the ladies can be a bit frustrated with you - once my family and I asked for wooden chopsticks, we hate the metal ones, and the waitress seemed annoyed. But honestly, the service doesn't bother me - not when the food is this good!"}
{"text":"I found this to be the most authentic looking Korean restaurant. Typically a majority of the patrons speak Korean. They have great lunch specials with a good variety of dishes, soups, and stews.  I ordered the Sol Long Tang and loved it. It reminded me of Gahn Mi Oak in NYC. All the ban chan were very fresh and tasty. The servers were very quick and polite. I definitely will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Service is a two, food is a four. We had to ask for water three times.  Oxbone soup broth is extremely bland, but the meat is soft.  The kimchi fried rice is deliciOus and ridiculously hot. The beef brisket with onion soup was a hit for taste buds but the meat to vegetable ratio is heavier on the veggie side. Seafood soon tofu is very tasty but medium hot is very spicy. They were accommodating and took the soup back to dilute the broth to make it less spicy when we mentioned it. I'd definitely go back to try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"for authentic Korean and consistently good food, Hodori.  They usually do not have enough servers, but all are bilingual and you will enjoy the food in the cultural experience."}
{"text":"I completely forgot to update and mention that I spent the next day throwing up. On my birthday. Again, what a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars b/c of the service. Even when it's not busy you have to flag down the servers to get their attention.   Their food is always A1 though. My personal favorites are their T1 Hodori soon soup special and Galbi short ribs. So good."}
{"text":"SO, let me preface this by saying that I am by no means an expert in Korean food.  When I have had it in the past, it is usually Korean BBQ with the side dishes and maybe some pancake.  But, from what I have had, I can say that this place is bomb.  The tofu soup, seafood pancake (although it is WAY overpriced), bibimbap, and bulgogi are all great.  Good food, decent service, but some things on the menu are a little more expensive than they should be in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here plenty of times and always enjoyed myself. I wont order any thing other than a #27, bibimbap during summertime. A light, fresh veggie dish w all the sides is a brilliant lunch or dinner.. I never feel ashamed of myself after eating the entire thing.  Im pretty sure the potato side dish is dessert, i love it. And the cucumbers, omg. Yuuuummmmmmm."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants. Can't go wrong with the beef bulgogli, spicy BBQ chicken, spicy BBQ pork, kalbi (short ribs), chap chae (clear noodles appetizer with red and green bell peppers, onions, and bits of bulgogi beef), kimchi tofu soup. Expect 6 little banchan side dishes. The BBQ dishes are just under $20 - which comes with rice. Chap chae is about $14 and plenty for an appetizer."}
{"text":"My best friend and I come here at least once a week, and we can honestly say it's like our second home.    Their food is amazing, and I have made it my new mission to try something new off the menu every time we go.  I dream about their kimchi-anything (rice and jjigae), and their soon dubu is some of THE best.  Obviously, though, since they specialize in soft tofu soups, hehe.    The service is great, super friendly, and they check on us regularly throughout the meal.  I always leave with a smile on my face and my tummy~.  Anyone who loves Korean food should come here!!!!!    P.S.  Let it be known, that if I ever need to be in a hospital, I hope it's Banner, since it's literally across the street from Hodori!  Haha!  P.S.S. As an avid fan of kpop, I enjoy that they play music off of band's albums that aren't just the promoted singles~."}
{"text":"I ate here on 11/23 for lunch and it was good. I wanted it again so I ate here on 11/27 and got food poisoning. I know it was from here because I didn't eat much else during the day, just an egg and English muffin. I won't be back in fear of getting sick again. I was sick exactly 24 hours so I know it was food poisoning. And I paid $30 to be in horrible pain for 2 days. (Entree was $20! Plus drink tax and tip)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and kind service!!!  We like the bulgogi, and dumplings, although I have never had a bad meal here.  They don't stint on the banchan which is nice, some restaurants make you feel guilty for asking   It's usually very busy so plan on avoiding rush times.    Friend who is half Korean says it's the best Korean food in town and I believe him!!!  Everything I have had is good and all is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best Korean food I've ever had! The kimchi pancake was amazing. Service was great and the Korean dessert place next door was a great place to go after this meal."}
{"text":"This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here.   But probably one of the best korean places on the east side."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I've moved to AZ about 10 years ago.  I ate here so often that at one point I was a \"Mayor\" on FourSquare and \"Duchess\" on Yelp!  They've changed ownership twice since 10 years ago, and the new one took over about 4-5 years ago I believe.  Their food's ok, but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjigae.  That's the reason why I came here all those times and I don't even touch their banchan, because it's so subpar compared to LA, SF, or NYC that it's laughable.  Their Soon Tofu is average and the Kalbi is average as well.  But you take what you can get here in AZ when you have a craving for Korean food.    Well, if you're serving mediocre food, at least you expect them to provide really good in service right?  NO!!  I have always been unhappy with their service since day one, but I just dealt with it.  Well, I've just had it today and sort of lost it!  The waiter (in his 20s, about 5'11\" tall) who speaks fluent Korean and Enliglish, just pushed me over the edge!  WTF??  Are you kidding me??  I could not believe the service I was getting from this guy!  OK so here's what happened.  I ordered 1 Soon Tofu Jjigae with only beef,  2 lunch special Kimchi jjigae, 1 Lunch special kalbi, 1 lunch special kalbitang. (5 total items)  He brought the banchan (side dishes) and rice and asked me if I wanted eggs in \"all of our soon tofu jjigae.\"  I said I only ordered one soon tofu.  Then he said I ordered 2 kimchi soon tofu, 1 beef soon tofu, 1 kalbi, and 1 kalbitang!  I said \"no I didn't\" and I repeated what I ordered.  Then he argued with me and said \"Yes you did! You ordered 3 soon tofu, plus kimchi jjigae, kalbi, and kalbitang!\"  I said \"are you kidding me right now?  Look here!  We're only 4 people!  Why would I order so many soups for?\"  The guy must be a moron, because he can't even count how many people there are to be ordering 7 items?  Do we look like we could eat that much?  We were two slim adults, and two kids under 15!!  Then he let out a big sigh and then stomped off to fix the order at the kitchen.  He comes back with our food and he literally bangs the soup bowl onto the table!  He is obviously emanating a negative attitude, bangs down the rest of the stuff and stomped off.  I just shook my head and we started to eat.  Half way through the lunch we needed more rice and napkin so I called him over since he was bringing stuff to the next table.  He obviously heard me and didn't bother turning around.  OK, so I'm thinking to myself, maybe he didn't hear me.  I call him again second time and he pretended he didn't hear me.  Then the third time, I called him loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear me and then he turns around, rolls his eyes, makes a face and then comes over.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I asked him \"are you giving me an attitude right now?\"  then he yells (yes he yelled at a customer) at me and says \"did I even look at you right now?\"  Then he passes by our table, goes to the next table and \"politely\" asks  \"may I take your order?\"  WTF?  I asked him to help me get something and he completely ignores me?    Ok so let's recap here.  He takes the order wrong, puts in 2 too many orders of Soon Tofu, then gets mad at me when I correct him that isn't so, then he practically throws the food at us banging every chance he gets, and then he ignores me when I call him!  OMG!  At this point, I'm FURIOUS!  I get up and go talk to the owner who happens to be there today.  I reiterate everything that just happened and he doesn't say anything but to just look towards the direction of the kitchen!  Then I say to him \"is it ok for the server to do that to a customer\" and he turns and apologized.  He said that it's his fault for not training the staff correctly.  OK, so I'll take that for an apology, but then he should go quietly talk to the server, have the server come over and apologize to me personally!  Nope, that never happened, and guess what happened next?  The owner comes over to our table, being extra nice, and says he's going to take care of our lunch on the house.  At this point, I'm still shaking from rage and I can't even eat anymore.  I said I'm not making a scene, because I want free lunch.  I'm going to pay for what needs to be pay for, I don't want free lunch.  So while the owner's talking to me at our table, that server is standing near the kitchen talking to another server, looking directly at me, and laughing at me!  WOW!   Just amazing!  I've dined out at so many restaurants over the years in my life at all different levels, from Michelin starred to hole-in-the-wall scary places, but this was just the worst service ever!!  Stay far away from this place!  I called my mother after what happened.  She was at a luncheon with 20 of her Korean friends for a church function.  You can bet that she spread the word.  None of those ladies are going there in the future.  And neither am I.  To the Owner:  word of mouth is a scary thing."}
{"text":"Ok, it was the photos from yelp that drew me in. My hankering for authentic Korean food is completely satisfied with their beef short ribs, kimchi and kimchi pancakes. The meat is nice in the fact that it is not just little bits hanging off bone as I was originally imagining. But there are plenty of flanks of meat off the bone, and quite delicious. The Kimchi is nice- crunchy, perfect sourness and spiciness.  Being that it was a Tuesday night, I didn't expect it to be this busy. There were 2 waitresses handling all the tables and were pretty busy and stressed. One of them emphasized that this was particularly a busy night. I make a note of it and can only think that it's because the food is great, and it is!  A little more expensive than I thought:   2 Dinner Short Ribs (comes with Kimchi sides) + Kimchi Pancakes + White Rice = $57. (No tip included). Of course I tipped, but it was a little more than i was expecting to pay. However, the most authentic Korean in town, no doubt."}
{"text":"The food was well prepared. Service was great!! Quick and polite never felt ignored. They put on our table ashtray size dishes with pickled potatoes, cucumbers salad, pickled sprouts, pickled adamame and cabage Kimchi which was spicy but not true Korean Kimchi because it lacked garlic. I guess they think that many customers might not appriciate garlic breath :). If you wanted more of the potatoes or any side dish just ask and they'll give give more of course at no extra charge. We were party of three, our check was $41. Very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the better Korean places in the valley. Their lunch specials are really good & are decent prices. Dinner can be a little expensive. The staff are friendly also."}
{"text":"So far, our experience on Asian dinning in AZ has been..well, less than average.  But tonight, we were pretty content with the food at Hodori.  Finally, a place we can put on our list of fav restaurants in AZ.  *Price = a little over priced. *Portions = the meat dishes gives you a huge pile. *Side dishes = they were ok. *Service = very polite but a little slow paced."}
{"text":"Really good Korean food.  If you are Asian you probably have already known about this place through relatives!  It's has the best tofu soup in Arizona. The meat dishes are also yummy too. One thing I've  tried and didn't care for much were the Korean pancakes... they weren't very flavorful at all.   The ambiance is average, the music is bizarre. If you really are looking for a true authentic experience I would try visiting Takamatsu, but overall good food!"}
{"text":"I saw a few comments here saying that this is a bad area for Asian food so they're surprised to find Hodori.  Are you serious? I think thisDobson Rd and vicinity area is great for Asian food - Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and more.  Hodori itself is very excellent.  I've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to state that the food is pretty good and the portions are huge. I would've been ok with a bit less food and less pricey.  I have been to this place twice for lunch with coworkers. At first I just thought the service is awful, and it takes a LONG time for the food to arrive. Eventually I realized that this place might actually be racist. If you are not asian/korean or if you come with people that are not asian/korean, you get served last. I have observed that Koreans that came in way later than we did were already served with their meals while we waited, waited, and waited some more. This observation really hit home when it was independently verified by a friend as he mentioned he observed the exact same thing. And he's half Korean. So there you go. If you are not Korean, expect crappy service and get your food after all the Koreans have been served, even if they came in way after you did.  Update: We did an experiment the other night after playing tennis with a group of friends. We went there with majority of asian people (3 of us asian and one non-asian person, with one that can at least pronounce the food in Korean). And surprise! Prompt service. So...food is good there, service is to be desired depending on who you go with...."}
{"text":"This was my 1st authentic experience! I love Hodori! I love Korean food! Hodori, IS the Gold Standard of perfect Korean Food, here in the major Phoenix & Mesa area of AZ."}
{"text":"Finding good Korean food in the Phoenix area = not easy, and this place is more than decent. I love the tofu soup and the kimchi/pork pancake, although both could be spicier. The dolsot bibimbap is also good and the kalbi well-seasoned.  Good selection of panchan each time I've come in.  I miss tabletop grilling, and the food is a little pricey for what you get, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I miss LA's Koreatown terribly but this definitely hit the spot. Pretty wide menu with familiar items mixed with more traditional Korean dishes.  Plenty of tables but the place still got packed on a weekday. Korean restaurants tend to be more spendy than other types of Asian food so be ready for that but they have some special deals posted on the wall at certain times. I will definitely be back to Hodori."}
{"text":"At ASU for a yoga festival; so, was craving Korean food.  This was one of the restaurants they suggested we were only a couple of miles away; so, we went.  Have been to several Korean restaurants here in Phoenix, Glendale; but none in East Valley. I was craving Bulgogi and was not disappointed; my friend is gluten free; so, asked if the \"sauce\" was soy sauce based; they couldn't answer; I even tried to say shoyu; at last they still didn't know what I was saying; so, my friend got the Bibim Bap. I really enjoyed the Bulgogi along with the Banchans that were served.  Not all of them were spicy; so, I really enjoyed it!!!  My friend really enjoyed the Bibim Bap; and so really liking this place.I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"As I think of my $80 tab and try and remember anything memorable about the meal, I stare off into the distance and forget to breathe through my nose.....  Beef bulgogi was run of the mill and the wee sized pot of steamed rice was, well, wee.  Nakji Dol Pan (Octopus stir fried with chili paste) was spiced properly and pretty tasty, but had no contrast and was getting monotonous  Tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet) was pedestrian  kimchi and accoutrement were also pretty bland.  eh eh eh"}
{"text":"I am not Korean so I don't know what \"traditional\" Korean food taste like. However, I think this place have good and decent Korean food. My friend and I order the seafood pancake and it was actually very good! The outside was crispy and the there was allot of seafood! It was very filling and the pancake was huge! We both also shared a kimchi fried rice with a fried egg on top and it was also very good! I like how the friend rice had those chunks of vegetables and the fried egg added a very savory taste to the rice making it not dry at all.   The service was good could be better but the waiter was nice and the lady came over and gave us some more side dishes. (Side dishes and free refills). The food is not that expensive and they packed allot! It's definitely shareable!   Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Living in Hawaii it is easy to find authentic Asian food. Not so easy in Phoenix. Thank you Yelp for pointing me to Homodori for a great Korean fix. Kim chee fried rice and Bulgogi hit the spot. Service was quick and friendly. The clientele was gorgeous. Can't wait to go home to Hawaii."}
{"text":"Kimchi tofu soup with pork and egg - where have you been all my life!?   I felt like it was \"comfort food\" even though I've never had it before.  it not only tastes amazing, but the texture of the silky tofu feels really good on your tongue. That sounds kinda weird but that's how I feel.    Husband got bulgogi which was good and I also got the spicy octopus.  Some pieces were cooked perfectly and others were a little chewy.    It was pretty expensive, but I think this is a place that's best to come with a big group of people and share the food as the portions are big.  There were several large groups there.  I feel like we could've had 4 people share what we ordered if we got another side and then it would've been a good deal.  I will definitely be back for more soup and to try some of their kimchi pancakes and their bowls with egg on top which look delicious.  This is one of my new favorite places for sure"}
{"text":"Hodori is my go-to Korean restaurant. It's unpretentious and reasonably priced but serves some of the best yukaejang (shredded beef, whisked egg, green onions, and noodles in a hearty red chile broth) I have ever had. This stuff is comfort food that warms my soul. It is also served with 5-6 delicious varied sides- kimchi, sliced tofu, potatoes in barley sauce, marinated bean sprouts, tiny fishes, sauteed fish cakes, and a couple of others."}
{"text":"I was relieved to find some Korean food in Arizona, but my overall experience at Hodori was a bit under average.  There was about a ten minute wait.  After I ordered my food, the side dishes arrived, and they were all very mediocre.  The kalbi was cooked to a good texture, but it sadly lacked flavour.  The yuk gae jang soup was relatively good, but it also lacked flavour.  It tasted like pure spiciness, rather than having other tastes.  The kimchi fried rice had an absolutely wonderful garlic fragrance, but I couldn't really taste it because of the spiciness.  Once again, this dish lacked flavour also.  The least worst dish, in my opinion, was the soon tofu.  It had an overall fuller taste, and was the type of soon tofu one would expect at a decent Korean restaurant.  A good part of it was that it did not have a powdery texture from the tofu.  The service was inattentive.  Although they were quite busy, it was necessary to ask for anything we needed, since no one came to check on us.  I was glad to have been able to eat some Korean food in Mesa, but I wish I had found a restaurant with better food and more attentive service."}
{"text":"just moved here from los angeles. wanted some korean food. had the soontofu which was fantastic. definitely recommend it.  there's also a korean market next door which is an added bonus to head to that strip center.  will be going back again very very soon."}
{"text":"In Short: Better than average food, but awful service.  Try the stew, pretty damn tasty.  Used to be the best Korean place in town but there have been a steady decline in the last few years.  Quality is a little down but the service seems to have taken a cliff dive without a parachute.  Takamatsu is probably the best Korean in town these days.  The korean stews in the stone bowls are so amazing, I pretty much go here for that and the bulgogi.  This may not look very appetizing but try the pork salad, it's a behemoth collection of greens topped with pickled pig feed sliced thinly, very tasty.  The accompanying small dishes are pretty delicious too, but they used to give better quality stuff like real fish, and tofu cakes.  I still go here occasionally for the food but I wish they get a clue about customer service."}
{"text":"It's this simple: the BEST Korean food in town!!! :D  We always eat tofu soup here and they're the best in town (we tried others), and probably the best I've ever had in my life! :D People at my Chinese church told me their Korean church pastors and friends said this is the best in town too!!! Whenever my friends from other places come visit me in Phoenix, I bring them here, and they all love this place!  We eat A LOT here so never really thought of writing a review (what logic is that?) and found that the quality is pretty consistent. I think I only encountered twice that weren't very good.  The spicy beef brisket soup is very nice too!!!! I've been lack of appetite lately (for over a week), not sure why, but when I ate this yesterday, I could eat the whole bowl (it was a large bowl too) and wanted more!! :D It's that delicious!  I hope that they'd have Korean BBQ too, haha :D"}
{"text":"This place is probably toward the bottom of my list of favorite Korean restaurants. I've been to quite a bit of Korean restaurants in many different states. The service was not bad. The server was friendly. The food on the other hand is just...\"meh\". The prices were a bit high for the quality of food. I can almost guarantee I probably won't return to this place. Other than that, everything else is good. The restaurant is clean and servers are ok."}
{"text":"I realize Hodori has had its ups and downs with the service over the past couple years.  I used to go her often but less because we have more options and the service was not great.   I took a chance and went again last night.  The resturant was packed.  It looked like there was also a private party happening as well.  Dispite the place being crowded I had to admit the service was really good.  The only issue I would have had was nobody asked if we wanted a refill but since we had soda and water we really didn't need it. We did have to flag servers down for other items and they were responsive. I had the bulgogi and it was good and filling.  I guess you can say I saved some money coming here instead of one of the many all you can eat places that opened.   Dispite being super busy the food arrived within a reasonable time so no complaints there.   Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"The dishes are excellent. Traditional flavouring and spices in all their dishes including with their condiment dishes. Service is mediocre to below satisfactory.  That's okay because when I go to an ethenic restaurant, I don't go there for service;  I go there for authtentic tasting dishes. Ergo, this is not a restaurant for holding a junket or power meetings."}
{"text":"I love the spicy seafood soup over here. However, service sucks more than ever! We sat down with no water on the table, no menus, and 3 different staffs going around doing nothing besides talking and joking with each other.  Before I loved this place, quick service and good food. Now only the food I'm gonna cross out the service! Staff interrupted my order just to ask what number is the food on the menu (You are a server, you're supposed to know!! DUH?) Anyway, I'll come back for the food only but not in the near future!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. The bulgogi and bibimbap were very enjoyable and kimchi tofu soup was perfect for the cloudy and chilly day that we went on. Although a little bit pricey, the portions are a good size and the customer service is great. I recommend this place for fresh, good korean food.Lots of choices and in a great area. Right next to Asiana market as well, so double score :)"}
{"text":"I had heard of this place for a while in AZ.  So i was looking forward to trying it with my the Asian professionals meetup group that I belong to.   I usually get the bibimbap but the one in the hot stone pot.  They actually cook it in the hot stone pot and serve it to you that way.  It was really good.  Pretty similar to the way I get in Korea Town back home in Los Angeles.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The side dishes are well prepared and the food is good. The service is ok, but they do bring out your food in a timely manner.   If you're not Korean they won't say hi or bye to you. Ignore it, just go for the food."}
{"text":"Although the drive for me is a little far, I enjoy going here to eat. Everything is affordable and the staffs are really friendly. I love their soups and number 51 (Bosam)."}
{"text":"If you need a Korean fix go to Los Angeles but of you're unable to drive you can hit up this joint for some spicy soft tofu soup."}
{"text":"Too slow. We ordered at 6:50pm and waited for more than 40 mins. So bad. Mg friends and I would not come here again. Waiting is a terrible thing and annoys all of us."}
{"text":"The korean population of arizona eat here, that alone should be enough to check it out. If not, the foods damn good too."}
{"text":"Out of all the korean bbq resturants in the east side I think Hodori is the best.  Thier Balgogi is flavored really well.  I always have the get the jap chai noodles there.  I'm usually seatted quickly, but it might take a little while for my food to be ready. & the metal chops sticks that when they bang on my teeth are no fun.  But the food is good and that's why i keep on comming back.  It's a great way to eat family style too."}
{"text":"My rating for this place has not changed (3.5), but I will say this.  Looking at some other reviewers comments, I do agree that the level of service and the quality in terms of the freshness of their ingredients and flavor of their dishes is not very consistent.  It would be great if they could fix this."}
{"text":"Nice lunch menu...I cannot review for dinner, I haven't been back to this place for over 5 years....my most recent trip was for lunch, the menu is extensive and great pricing."}
{"text":"Okay, I am half Korean and I love this place. I have been here twice for lunch and had the chicken bulgogi. The kimchi's were all awesome.  It does not have the best atmosphere, the service is so-so, but the food is delicious. It reminds me of my mom's cooking.  I am so glad that I found this place and look forward to being on the East side of the Valley so I can go there for lunch again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with another couple last night.  All of us are very white and very non-Korean so I was concerned about the service we would receive after reading a few reviews on Yelp.  I was actually pleasantly surprised with the service.  Our waiter was very friendly and fast and answered any questions with a smile.  It was about 7pm on a Wednesday night and the place wasn't too crowded.  There were probably 15 other people in the place who were all of Asian decent so you know the place is the real deal.  The ambiance is a bit cafeteria-like but it didn't matter because I was there for a new culinary experience as this was my first time eating Korean food.  Now about the food....  After they take your drink and food orders, your table is given 6 or 7 small appetizers.  I don't remember what everything was but I do remember the kimchi.  I've never had it before but I know it is a Korean dining staple so I gave it a shot.  I was not a fan of it and probably won't ever have it again, but it was interesting to say the least.  Here is what we ordered:  * Mushroom Soon Tofu soup with beef - the soup is what this place seems to be known for judging by the Yelp reviews so I had to order it.  The bowl came out boiling hot which was good because we opted for the raw egg to be cracked and put into it right before it was served.  The soft tofu was a bit different to me but the soup had good flavor and a nice kick.  I would order it again but I'd like to try other ingredients such as prawns, etc.  * Short ribs - this is secretly why I wanted to come here.  I was told they were awesome and they were.  The marinate\sauce was not overpowering and they were very tender.  I will for sure order these again.  * BBQ chicken - not the leanest or best cut of chicken but it was very good and flavorful.  Again, the sauce\marinade was not too strong.  * Octopus in spicy sauce - this was the \"crazy\" dish for me for the evening.  I enjoy fried calamari and squid/octopus salad, but larger chunks of squid or octopus scare me a little.  I mean they weren't real big chunks but big enough to where you see you are eating a bunch of those little suction cup thingys that octopi have.  Between that and the chewiness of each bite made my stomach turn a bit.  However, the dish had good flavor and a nice kick thanks to the red sauce they bathed it in.  I'm not sure I would order this again.  Anyway, I would definitely come back again.  I enjoyed the service and would like to try other tofu soups and some of the other meat dishes.  I really want to try the bbq ribeye and bbq pork dishes in addition to more of that chicken and those short ribs!"}
{"text":"The korean food is delicious overall but it takes FOREVER for the food to come out and a bit over priced."}
{"text":"I loved this and can't wait to try it again.  It was packed on a Tuesday at lunch and it is a pretty large restaurant.  The green tea is very green.  The kimchis are so delicious and diverse and plentiful.  I tried the bulgoki and it was so yummy.  Service is both friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle and I've been looking everywhere for korean food. This place is by far the better korean restaurants out here. I Recommend Kalbi tang, Soon Dae gook or soondooboo.   This place is cleaner than most restaurants out here with fresh side dishes. The waitresses are very nice and helpful. Tip them well ;)  If you're looking for a korean bar, I recommend ROK"}
{"text":"I keep coming back. They have a great value for their lunch specials. The portions are big and I always have leftovers for dinner. The wait staff is very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Love this place for Korean tofu and dishes! They provided a greeting and pointed to the table for a party of 2. They took our drinks right away and came back to ask for our orders. Very prompt and friendly! The side dishes were provided and then our main dishes. I had the traditional bulgogi hot pot and my wife had the kimchi tofu soup! Very fresh and delicious! I couldn't have ask for a better visit than today! Thank you and I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went here last night and the food was right on! I come from NYC and I know good Korean food when I see it, and Hodori has great Korean food. The side dishes are so much better and there are so much variety than other Korean restaurants that I've been to in AZ. This place always seems busy whenever I come, but I'm sure there's a good reason for that... their food is awesome! Try the seafood pancake for an appetizer and one of the great bbq's on the menu (I like the kalbi). the portions are huge and the side dishes will fill you up! They don't have dessert on the menu, but they give fresh fruit at the end of the meal. YUM!"}
{"text":"We had a really nice server who checked on us frequently. My only complaint was the lack of meat in my friend's japchae and lack of meat in my kimchi bokum bap. There were tiny, tiny pieces of meat inside them and regretted our decision coming there as soon as our plates arrived which is sad."}
{"text":"So I'm going through this faze thanks to Netflix where I wanna watch Korean dramas. In these Korean dramas, they are always eating, eating, EATING. Ususally it's some version of kimchi. So I've been looking around for a while to find a Korean restaurant so I could get some kimchi (little did I know Fry's has it in the produce section).   Thanks to Yelp...Hodori is the highest rated Korean food restaurant I've found. It deserves the rating. The people are really nice, and the food is really good. Did they make a kimchi fan out of me...not really. So why just three stars? I was really lost when it came to ordering and everything. I didn't know what to get and what was what. I wished the waiter could've explained the side dishes and everything.   I would definitely come back, but only with someone who's a little more familiar with Korean food so they can explain to me what to get and what I'm eating."}
{"text":"Food is always good. We have never been disappointed when coming here. It's a little pricey, but the portions are always a good size as well. Especially lunch. Like most reviews the service does lack everytime we are here, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Best authentic Korean food I've found in the valley. Highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy pork. The flavor of the sauce was good and the meat was cooked well, but it was also very stringy and fatty. Overall, the food was mediocre. The food prices are too high for the quality offered. However, the portion sizes are quite large, so there should be leftovers for extra meals.  Our service was terrible. The servers would not look in our direction for 20 minutes at a time. They did not once visit during the meal. They brought two dishes out 10 minutes before the others and brought one person's food out 15 minutes after everyone else had their food. We had trouble paying, since they would ignore us and wipe down an adjacent empty table even though we were clearly waving and yelling to them.  The combination of terrible service, average food, and high prices ensures that I will not return."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. Great service, great Korean dishes at very generous portions. I really just enjoy the regular-styled Bulgogi (thinly sliced beef served in a hot stone plate with caramelized onions). Also really like the bipbimbap (veggies, ground meat, and rice in a hot stone plate). Bring that out with an unlimited supply of kimchi and we're good to go!"}
{"text":"The food here is a tad pricey, but I forget that most Korean places will bring out their array of side dishes (kimchi, potatoes, anchovy, seaweed?, etc.) Other than that, I'm used to my BBQ having more of a BBQ flavor. Yes, that charred, I'm going to give you cancer eventually carcinogen flavor - don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about! The flavor was still really good but not exactly 5 star quality. ,   Pluses are that they refilled side dishes! I've never been to any other Korean place that offered. They also refill your drinks, abd the kimchi doesn't make your mouth feel like its going to burn off.  =) All in all, its a very nicely decorated mom and pop run place that makes really quality food."}
{"text":"The kimchi is usually fresh, prices cheap, and always quality beef and vegetables. Order the Yu-Ke-Jang soup or Jap Chae noodles. You will not be disappointed in the quality of the food. Sometimes it gets busy and I've had our server go M.I.A. a couple of times, but they are always friendly and polite. For a quick Korean food fix this is where my mom and me always go. Love that we can go to Asiana Market and The Street (Boba smoothies!) right next door so we can walk off our food a little bit."}
{"text":"This is a great find, Large menu full of interesting options, helpful staff who can help you craft a vegetarian compatible dish if you don't see it on the menu.   For me this was my first venture in to authentic Korean food and I really liked it. fresh flavors that on the surface seem healthy. Food sizzling in pots, fresh cracked eggs a real adventure compared to generic Asian food. \  There are many tables and service is decent but it takes time for the hot pot to get hot so keep that in mind when odering."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a weeknight, seemed like we had to wait a little too place our order.  The food was good, liked it and will be going back.  I love Korean food.  I had the kalbi and my wife had a tofu and pork soup was really good."}
{"text":"We went in on a weekday when it was relatively empty. For korean bbq, it took way too long to get food. The older little lady didn't ever come by to check on us. Everyone is so fixated on delivering food to tables, that they ddon't look around to see if peoples glasses are empty or maybe \" she's staring at me, maybe she needs something\". The food portions are large but with me living in gilbert, it is not worth the drive. I will not be returning. The food to me is ok but service is what is a turn off."}
{"text":"This restaurant so deserves a 5 star rating. I'm from LA and used to eating in Ktown where it's hardcore koreans. Since I relocated to AZ, I haven't found any good Korean food, just sub par. I checked this place out and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I tried the Bulgogi hot pot, kimchi friend rice, Yuki Jang and the Kalbi and they were all delicious! Most places make the Kalbi too sweet... this place makes it just right! The staff are very friendly and helpful. Too bad they don't do \"All you can eat Korean BBQ\" here."}
{"text":"best korean food in thye state and very friendly people.  if you want to try real korean cuisine, you must come here.   it is perfect."}
{"text":"They make really good tofu soups. I like how they hand out Yakult at the end when paying."}
{"text":"Very traditional. This could be a plus or a minus. If you want authentic Korean food in an authentic Korean way, this is the place to go. If you want a comfortable atmosphere, fast service, or a \"fusion\" menu, this is probably not the place for you."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The food was ehhh, nothing special. It took them forever to bring out the check and pick it up again. Also the food here is very expensive - too expensive for what they're serving. My boyfriend wasn't very hungry and he tried to order a small plate off the kids menu and the waiter was extremely condescending and rude about it ultimately not letting him order."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit on a weekly basis if possible. Me and my best friend, Emily (who reviewed earlier), come here very often. Even one of the waiters recognizes us! I don't remember his name, but he's the one with glasses, lovely young man! I love that they play kpop and not only their latest singles, but so many different songs. I try to eat something new every time I come here, but I always come back to my kimchi jjigae. Everything else I have tried has been fantastic. Yuk gae jang, soon dubu soups, jun, bokum, fried rice, cold noodles, you name it and it's fantastic. Great happy hour, too! I really can't get over how much I love this place! anyways, if you're looking for great authentic Korean food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This review is based on only one lunch time visit.   The day I came this casual Korean Eatery was packed with people (a good sign..?) but only had two servers working as a team to wait on EVERYONE.   Our order was taken in a timely manner and we waited around 25 minutes for our lunches to arrive.  I ordered the grilled Atka Mackerel. As tasty as this fish was....and it was...this meal was almost impossible to eat because it was filled with hundreds of tiny bones. I don't think fish with this many bones should be on any menu anywhere. I do note the side dishes with kimchi, cucumbers and four other sides were tasty and mostly delicious. I thought they seemed above average. A better choice would have been the Black Cod with Radish but the price difference was just too much difference for lunch time. Mackerel was $13.99 and the black cod was something like $26.00.   Back to service I wanted to ask questions about a few of the sides but nobody was able to check on us during the lunch.  My husband had the Kimchi Bokum Bap.(Ribeye in a hot stone pot with egg). We both thought the ribeye was tender and tasty but lacked any heat. I think some sort of hot Korean Sauce should have been given with this dish?  This is a place that I would re-visit but I do have some reservations about some of the dishes such as the mackerel and the lack of service. So for me that's three stars. Still a positive rating.   I do note this was a holiday weekend and it's possible they might have been busier than expected and short on help."}
{"text":"As horrible as this sounds, I'm used to Korean restaurants on the east coast. Translation: Amazingly authentic food + terrible service if you're white. Not that I blame them.  This place was amazing. Easily the best Korean food that I've ever had. The service was so wonderful and quick that I almost forgot I was a white person in a Korean restaurant. It was a very classy experience even though the place is sort of set up like a cafeteria.  My only complaint is that I wish they had more Bibimbap options. There were only two. But I suppose that's because there is an emphasis on the BBQ portion of the menu.   The price to me was worth it."}
{"text":"It always seems to be lacking in the protein department. Not enough meat. The service was super rushed this time despite my $30 bill for s single diner. The food ultimately is awesome. Service, and perhaps presentation of the protein would be beneficial."}
{"text":"Hodori serves pretty good food. My husband turned me on to it, however, they have a B rating from Health & Sanitation which freaked me out when I first ate there. Also, the service can be a total hit and miss, but the food tends to make up for it."}
{"text":"The Kimchi Jjigae (stew/soup) is great! One of the best I've had in town next to my mom's though. She makes the best. The next favorite item is the pork bulgogi bbq. These are the only two things I get every time I go so I can't really comment about the other stuff. The side dishes they bring out are okay but again I keep comparing everything to my mother's cooking so everyone else is not really getting a fair chance.   Price:  A bit pricey but the portion is large. $11-15 range for the dishes I mentioned. Two people can split a dish.  Atmosphere: Mostly Korean's as customers, relaxed nothing special, and crowded after church on Sundays.  Service: hit or miss, be patient, no one is trying to give bad service on purpose, relax, get up and ask for something if you can't bare it any longer. (it really depends on how many servers are working and how busy it is)  Top two Korean food place in town. (they have awesome stews/soups)"}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California, where Korean restaurants are abundant compared to AZ, the pickings of where to go for good Galbi and Jap Chae are very slim.  I tried Hodori last night and I was pretty impressed with the Jap Chae and the Galbi was really good although the sauce is very subtle than most.  But I'd definitely go here again to fix my cravings."}
{"text":"I had the Seaweed Sundubu  and my partner had Yukgaejang. At most places we are used to getting the Banchan soon after ordering, but here they brought them at the same time as our orders. Nothing special about the Banchan: potato, broccoli, tofu, kimchee, bean sprouts, and black beans - but they were all well-prepared. The same could be said for our two entrees; they were quite good, but nothing special or outstanding. Service was adequate, though I would have appreciated a water refill. Overall, not as good as the best we've had, but better than average."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Self seating. Waitor was very nice and explained what everything was. Great flavors. Amazing portion sizes. Everthing was very taste full. I will be going again for sure."}
{"text":"We tried a number of things we have never had and everything was very good. They were very nice and answered all of the questions we had. We really enjoyed this place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good Korean restaurant in Phoenix, and this place definitely measures up! The prices are a little higher than expected, but it's a popular establishment and the staff are friendly!  I'm a huge fan of bibimbap, and I love that their hot pot bibimbap comes with Kalbi! Our table also shared a seafood pancake, and it was really yummy! A lil more shrimp than I would have liked (esp since they were of the frozen baby shrimp variety), but it was crisp and had a good consistency!  Didn't get a chance to try any of their bbq items, but their tofu soup lunch special looked good! Side dishes were okay. Good variety, but I was hoping for some fish cakes or cold noodles."}
{"text":"I'm asian, so that make me a automatic expert on korean food.  The interior of this restaurant needs a renovation badly. Service is good, but the food is average. Not worth eating out. I order the korean rib...it was average...I believe they pan fried it...ribs are bbq not pan fried...."}
{"text":"My go to Korean spot when I'm on the east side. I've only had their spicy pork bulgogi. It's super yummy and their side dishes are also yummy too. Only \"complaint\" would be.. they don't give enough rice ! I've only ordered this to-go. Everything was neatly packaged! Just more rice please ! Still five stars only because it's my fave spot in all of Arizona !"}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food.  Delicious and the customer service makes sure you never are without those lovely side dishes.  Not fancy, but not Americanized either so well worth coming in for.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go out for some authentic Korean one night about a week and a half ago. He suggested a place he had been to a while back and I said \"Sure, why not?\".  We got there and sat ourselves at a table near the center of the restaurant. It's a kind of a hole in the wall but you can tell it's a great place due to the people and atmosphere. Our waitress was kind and patient as we decided on the bone-in pork and some spicy chicken. Before our food came out, we were offered a variety of different small bite appetizers of different vegetables, potatoes, etc.  My love ordered some Korean sake and I ordered the hot tea that they offer complementary and I was pleasantly surprise to fine it was made of wheats grains. Healthy and amazingly delicious! I was so impressed by this tea, I asked where to buy it. I was blown away by the young lady's response. She said it was right next door at the market and she happily offered to walk over there with me right then in order to point out the correct one! Cannot get better than that for customer service!  The food was pretty amazing but the staff definately made this experience!"}
{"text":"I came here on a friday for a lunch and it was a full house and only two servers... i bet they were pissed LOLOL   I wouldve left for another restuarant but my mom insisted we eat here (like y wtf) anyways  We wait like 15+ minutes for the server to get us some water and our order so while i waited i ended up going to the boba store next door to get a drink bcuz i was so thirsty -_-  I ordered the spicy dweji bulgogi  and the tips were a bit burnt and when i ate it i could taste and smell the burntness throughout... great.  I also ordered the seulong tang  and if youre korean you know that in it theres always  noodles but instead they had the rice noodles that always goes in like pho at vietnamese restaurants. Because of that the noodles were hard and it strayed away from the light and softness of the soup.... wtf did u run out of ingredients(?). The soup broth was good tho.  The only thing is despite how stressful it seemed the servers didnt express any anger or frustration which was refreshing. Oh and they gave us cold tea (Yasss cold  is bomb)   Theres alot of nonkoreans eating here and that just shows the food doesnt fit korean taste----   Wouldnt come again, sorry"}
{"text":"Objectively speaking, this restaurant is positioned right in the median line among Korean restaurants. However, I've lived in both LA and SF for several years each, so I could be a harsh critique here.  This is the only Korean restaurant in Tempe (aside from the one-offs like Paradise Hawaiian BBQ) and so you're not exactly picking from a bunch anyway. The food tends to be well-portioned, though many of the dishes had been pre-cooked and are just heated to order (i.e. Yukkaejang). My biggest discontent is the price, which is quite expensive comparing against the price level of other Korean restaurants I've been to, and absurdly expensive when compared against the other restaurants of similar caliber in Arizona.  The best thing happening here is the pancake, so definitely try it out if you're new to Korean food. It's about $13 (maybe even $15?) and serves as a great appetizer to split between 3-4 people. Don't go for the happy hour stuff-- they are puny in portion.  The second best thing happening here is the service, though it depends on who you get. The younger servers tend to be really friendly, well-spoken, and willing to take your fight to the kitchen for you. For example, my Yukgaejang (spicy noodle soup) showed up with no noodles-- the girl server had the kitchen serve me a whole side bowl of noodles and soup for free! The older servers, by contrast, tend to be hags."}
{"text":"Bad taste ever! Recently I ordered Tonkatsu, it was so dry and no meat inside of it. It was just like paper thickness! I would never go this place again!"}
{"text":"My wife who is Korean and I LOVE this place. The food is very authentic, and the service is fast and friendly. I love the Spicy Pork Bulgogi, and the Spicy DakGogi. My wife loves pretty much everything on the menu. Nice Ice Cold Korean Beers as well, and lots of tasty Bon Chon! Located in a plaza with a pretty good Korean Market as well. Prices are a bit steep at dinner time, but well worth it as the food is really very well prepared, and the portions are fairly large. Definitely worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"I have only been here one time, but what I ordered was so delicious I want to return soon! I ordered the spicy chicken bulgolgi along with some barley tea. Both were really good. I usually don't order chicken bulgolgi because often it's either a little dry, bland or both. That was definitely not the case here. The chicken was exactly what it should be. Full of flavor and not over cooked. I was surprised with the barley tea too. It was all awesome. The person I went with ordered a noodle dish that I don't think I would have been fond of but they loved it! The service was really slow but that was my only issue and even then it wasn't that bad. Next time I'm in the area I will probably eat here but call it in ahead for pickup this time. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for many years now but remember it being pretty good. It still holds true and with the lunch special prices (9.95-11.95), my friend and I were able to have the perfect amount of quality food at decent prices. We ordered a Kalbi lunch special and a Japchae. There were probably 9 pieces of that deliciously tender short rib and that was the perfect amount complementing the generous portion of japchae with beef that came out steaming hot. Went at 12:30 and there weren't that many people and the service was overall nice and efficient. He refilled our kimchi banchan generously as well...we can all use a little more kimchi in our lives ! I loved the fact that there was a selection of 8 banchan (small side dishes complimentary to most Korean dining experiences) with the meal and they didn't bring it all out at once but rather with our main entrees. This way we wouldn't get super full on banchan."}
{"text":"Even though my friends were forty minutes late and I was forced to sit in shame like a pathetic loser, the staff offered me water and politely ignored me otherwise, even as the restaurant began to rapidly fill up for dinner. We had various forms of soondoobu (spicy soft tofu soup) - I had mine with kimchi (I am Korean, after all). We topped off our meal with some pork barbeque, which was pretty good but not as yummy as my mama's. Finishing up with mochi ice cream (not exactly Korean... but oh well) in a yummy chocolate sauce rounded out a pretty good meal overall.  The side dishes (banchan) were okay - the bean sprouts were excellent, but I didn't try the kimchi ('cause, hello, it was in my soup - kimchi overload = not a good night). I would probably go back again, but only if my friends suggested it 'cause most Korean restaurants in America don't have the Korean dishes I really like. D:"}
{"text":"Not the most generous of Korean places (i.e. their small appetizer plates that start the meal are a bit meager) but other than that complaint, I really like this place.  (Also conveniently located next to a Korean market in the event you get inspried to make your own meals).  The stews are delicious and the bulgulgi isn't too sweet.  I really like their bibimbap.  If you don't mind smelling of garlic for a week, check it out."}
{"text":"One of the best soon dubu I have had in a restaurant. And its not in Kali or Korea, but Arizona?!?!   A lot of the soon dubu places in AZ or even Kali don't make it spicy enough. Even when you ask for SPICY. This place listens. I had the pork soon dubu, and the bf had a seafood one. We both were surprised by how good it was. The tofu, broth, and other ingredients were so flavorful. You could taste each individual ingredient, yet it all came together wonderfully. :) The service is pretty fast and efficient. The restaurant was pretty spacious and clean as well. (A lot of other places are really cramped and stuffy).  Why did I take off one star? Their side dishes are subpar. They don't have much variety, and the ones they did have looked old and dried out. They don't serve their soon dubu w/ a fried fish like many of the other soon dubu places do. :( Plus their rice is served in a plain metal bowl rather than a stone bowl. So you don't get that crispy/burnt rice (that you pour water on) towards the end of you meal. :( Also, we requested bori cha, and I think they charged us for it. ^__^"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Edge of Glory)  I'm gonna Yelp Hodori And I'm tasting on some Korean food I'm gonna Yelp Hodori And I'm tasting on some Korean food  I'm on gonna Yelp, and Yelp, and Yelp, and Yelp and Yelp, and Yelp, and Yelp I'm gonna Yelp Hodori And I'm tasting on some Korean food I'm gonna Yelp Hodori  Hodori is one of those popular Korean restaurants that serves up some nice traditional Korean home cooking.    I came here with a large group of people and service was on top of it's game needless to say.  Nice and funny at the same time!  I ordered my favorite of course the Seafood Tofu Soup, while some of my friends order the Dol Pan Bibam Bap; a vegetarian dish for sure. Finally the the Bulgogi hot pot.  I can say I enjoyed my Seafood Tofu Soup.  The Bibam Bap was nice, but not as flavorful according to my friend.  Nicely plated for sure I think.  Finally the bulgogi was sweet, but definitely needed more spice!    Overall, pretty good place for a quick Korean home style cooking.  You don't get a lot of side dishes like some Korean restaurants, but I didn't really cared for it anyways. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A very great place to eat Korean food! Definitely come during lunch hours for cheaper price. Food is on point and very flavorful! Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"when i first moved to az, my friends went through this phase where all they wanted to go eat was hodori - and i didn't get why, as the food was just MEH. of course, i was coming from korean food in SoCal, so can you blame me?   well, i went back recently with my bf, and realized that the problem was.... hodori is more of a soondubu (spicy tofu stew/soup) place! sheesh. if i had known, i could have had much better meals here.  ANYWAYS! hands down, THE. BEST. soondubu in the state of AZ (i dunno if that's saying much....). for those of you who can handle spicy korean food, the \"medium\" spicy, isn't really that spicy - it's more of a mild, pleasant spicy.  I like the sokk-goh soondubu (i think it's called the house special, with prawns, oysters, clams, and beef) the most, as i think it has the most flavor.  so, i'll be back when i'm craving some soondubu. or cheap neng myun (cold noodles) when it gets a little hotter."}
{"text":"Just before I was leaving for California after winter break, I decided to bring my family for Korean BBQ because they had never tried it before. I did not realize this was not the type of Korean BBQ with the grill in the center of the table and the marinated meat that we get to cook. Nonetheless, we ordered beef bulgogi, bibimbap, and some soups.  I think I must have ordered incorrectly. I went for the traditional beef bulgogi and wound up being very surprised that was served in a bowl of soup with glass noodles. I thought I was getting a skillet of grilled, marinated meat to share with my family.  The bibimbap came in a huge bowl (I like to order it hot), and here, I was a little disappointed again, because I thought it would have the black rice because that's how I've had it before. Instead, it was just the regular white rice we typically eat.  Soups were not that great as well. We ordered one with pork ribs, and the meat was not tender. The only vegetables in our soups were green onions, which we are not a big fan of (they're great to give flavor to a dish, but not as vegetables for a meal, I think). We didn't eat very much, and were not happy with the fact that each dish is $10-$13.  The restaurant is welcoming, but this meal just really wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"The food is alright but the service is terrible and slow every time I come here! The waiters need to follow up on the tables for any water or banchan refills instead of just serving the food & moving on to new orders. Takamatsu in chandler has better quality  food & the best service since the manager is on the floor directing the employees.  Chodang is also better in food quality but the service can be slow at times but its not as bad as it is at hodori."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come to this restaurant ALL THE TIME and each time we are never disappointed! The people there are so inviting and welcoming! And their foods are amazing! I'm new to the Korean foods but I'm loving it for sure! This place is a place I will always come by even when I live on the west side of the valley!"}
{"text":"In all Korean restaurant I have eat in AZ, I place Hodori second. Go eat with my sister for lunch. Since she know all Korean, I let her order. The service is nice but it seems they are understaffed but I can't complain because it is a busy lunch. The kimchi soup go out first. I like it! Hot, sweet, salty, and sour combine all in one. Yes! Score! Then the barbecue meat with rice. It is pretty okay for me but the meat is a bit tough. I though Korean barbecue beef always tender? However, minus one star for the bathroom. I really lose my appetite when come to the bathroom. It is really dirty. They should have cleaned. Until it clean, this remain 4 stars."}
{"text":"While staying in Scottsdale my husband and I invited a couple who had never eaten Korean food to join us for dinner at Hodori.     We started off with seafood pancake as an appetizer.  The pancake tasted good; however, it did not have enough seafood in it. The next one we ordered was japche, which had great flavor.   Main dishes were grilled Kalbi and spicy sautéed octopus.  Kalbi tasted great.    Everyone enjoyed the great flavor of the spicy octopus that was cooked in cabbage and onions.  But I should have ordered squid instead.  Even though the flavor was great the octopus was a little chewy.  Our friends also learned to make a lettuce wrap and enjoyed it very much.    Overall, good food and good service."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and always have a great experience.  Their soondubus and other soups are all very good.  I had the oxtail soup the other day--clear white broth, thin slices of meat, and rice noodles--which was delicious and an excellent hangover cure :) The service is great, staff is very friendly and great at making recommendations.  The server brought us out a sweet soy sauce for our meat without us asking for it so we were really appreciative.  The only criticism I have is that their BBQ meats are not one of the best I've had, but I typically don't come here for that anyway because they make up for that in the many other dishes that they cook so well.  Also, Hodori is located in a plaza next to Saketini and a Boba cafe so you have options for places to go to after dinner if you come with a group of friends."}
{"text":"5 stars Korean food.  It's a shame I don't live in the state of Arizona anymore, because this is my favorite Korean restaurant in the whole country.  Yes the whole country!  I wish I can pick this place up and move to it to Nor Cal.  I'd trade every single Korean restaurants up here in exchange for this place. Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed. My favorite dishes here are the daeji bulgogi and seafood sundobu. By the way, if there is a certain pan chan dish you enjoy, you can always ask for more!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 9:20pm ( they close at 10) and were greeted very nicely with a warm smile by our young handsome waiter.   We viewed the menu beforehand so we ordered quickly. I was so pleasantly surprised by the extra 5 side dishes, marinated tofu, zucchini, cabbage with pasta, kimchi and cucumbers. They were all tasty.   My soft tofu soup with mushrooms and beef was very flavorful, hot temp, a bit spicy and I added rice. My hubby liked his seafood soup very much too. I will certainly return with friends to enjoy another meal.   The waiter came by as I finished savoring the last bite of tofu and asked if I'd like more, since they had extra. I said sure 2 pieces. He was generous and gave me a bowl of it.   I know a couple of Korean expressions and when I used them he bowed so respectfully, it was charming to see and I was flattered. 'Anyo'"}
{"text":"I would've gone for just under four stars, given the option, because the food was pretty good at best and the service was polite, but slow. I went there on Wednesday, 1/7/09, around 7 p.m., with my BF for his first eat-out Korean dinner. It's in the northwest corner of Dobson and Southern, just north of the gas station, in the same shopping center as Oregano's and Saketini.   Mostly, I wanted to try to find tofu soup--crazy-soft tofu pieces in flavorful spicy broth with whatever add-ins you want, from seafood to beef to mushroom to kimchi. YOM. You could smell the spice and sizzle (much of their dishes are served on hot plates, and meat always gives off a certain smell when charred up deliciously like that). Decorations were sparse and the lighting was almost a little too bright, like cafeteria-bright, with the tables and chairs set up diner-style, in neat rows. It wasn't packed (one half of the restaurant, I guess an overflow section, was dark until a couple showed up later), but business was steady. There was a big group of athletic-looking Koreans in the middle of the room having a seriously happy chow-down (everything looked good) and several Korean and mixed families and couples.  The hostess/waitress waved at us from across the restaurant to ask how many seats we'd need, then waved us to a table. After that, it was a bit of a wait before we got menus. They had an interesting selection, and by that I mean appetizing, choices and decent prices, with entrees starting at $9 and capping in the $20s. They also have a decent selection of lunch specials. It was a somewhat agonizingly long time before anyone came to take a drink order. By the time our polite, attentive waitress came, we were ready to put in our entire order, so we put in for drinks (which came quickly), goon mandu (dumplings) for an appetizer, short ribs, and tofu soup with pork and mushrooms.  The dumplings came without our getting impatient, and they were pretty tasty--slightly crisped wrappers and plenty of filling. Shortly after we finished, we received our banchan (traditional Korean appetizers on several small plates). I doubt I can remember all of them, but it included kimchi, kak tu gi (radish kimchi), gam-ja (braised potato and carrot), k'ong na mul (bean sprout salad), seaweed salad, and one or two other dishes, which was more than enough for both of us. We thought everything tasted just fine. After we'd enjoyed the banchan for about 5-10 minutes, they brought our little bowls of rice, then our little pile of short ribs on a sizzling plate (with a polite warning not to burn our hands off) served over raw, thickly slivered onions, and after a few moments longer, our tofu soup in a little hot clay pot. They also brought a raw egg in case we wanted one cracked in.   The ribs were good, but just a little tough--they're supposed to be that way, but if you're expecting something the consistency of all-day braised short ribs, these aren't them. I loved the tofu soup--eat it as soup or over rice, which is ten times better. It was AWESOME, but I\"m biased because it's like comfort food to me. Soft, creamy tofu curds in spicy broth (they ask you how spicy you'd like it, if you want it spicy at all), and just enough pork and mushrooms to still keep it tofu soup. It hit the spot.  The wait staff was pretty good about keeping my BF's glass of diet coke filled, and that was a feat in itself. It kind of took awhile for someone to bring the check, but when they did, they brought a few tasty coffee candies. We considered desserts, but we couldn't find any in the regular menu or on any special menus.  Overall, the service may have been a little slow, but it wasn't for lack of trying--plating and delivering and clearing the banchan plates alone can be a Herculean task. We really enjoyed the food and plan to go back again. Our overall dinner was a bit pricey because of the short ribs, but it would be easy to get away with a $25 dinner for two if you went for a couple tofu soups and a couple of non-alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"One of the better Korean restaurants I've ever been too.  Service is friendlier than most, and the food quality is excellent.  Prices are good, too.  The Bulgogi is my favorite, and they do a really good job with it.  I'm sad that I now live across town from here, and can't make it very often."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Kimchi fried rice is very good. Wife said the bibimbap did not have any flavor.  Everything was going well until my friend said he felt something scurry across his foot. A big roach with wings. It scurried across the floor and up the wall where two ladies were dining. Girl tried to get it but she missed and it dropped on the other side of the bar. Automatic F for today."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale so I'd say this is the closest, authentically Korean restaurant for me.  I usually love all their banchan (side dishes) and their house spicy tofu soup.  So... Korean restaurants are kind of notorious for having bad service and this one probably tops the list in that category :( ..like you have to hunt down your server for almost everything and I'm Korean!  I'm almost tempted to travel a little further for better service."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place have been recently getting negative reviews. However, as a first timer here, I actually really enjoyed it. I love the side dishes, especially the hardboiled eggs.  I felt that their bulgogi meat was very tender and flavorful. I also really enjoyed the spicy tofu soup and spicy squid. I've always enjoyed Korean food and wouldn't mind coming back here again.  Service was also very attentive.  Place was getting a little packed on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Korean Food + Me = true love.  I adore Korean food.  I'm not kidding. It's probably my favorite cuisine.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  My typical favorites are kimchi jigae (spicy tofu/kimchi/pork soup), Haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), Galbi (short ribs), oh jing oh duk bokki (spicy squid with rice cakes), Bibimbap (rice bowl with veggies and bulgogi), mul mandu (dumplings)... I could go on and on.    If it's your first time with Korean food and you're not very adventurous, get the Galbi and JapChae noodles or Bibimbap (but be sure to try the side dishes (called panchan).  If you're in for the adventure and heat... see my list above! :)  Hope and dread were the battling in me when I left CA and realized I'd have to find Korean food here in AZ.  Turned out to be a needless battle though as the Phoenix area continues to surprise me with their hidden and limited but delicious, authentic fare...  Yum yum Hodori!  This was my first taste of Phx area Korean food and I have to say, I was impressed!  It's much better than I expected it to be.  They have an extensive menu so I ordered Bibimbap, Kimchi jigae, and Galbi.  It was all good.  The panchan was tasty, too.  I still crave LA Korean food sometimes but this was definitely good enough to return to, many time.  See ya there!"}
{"text":"Wow not even an apology. They forgot our \"banchan\" and after they assured us they were in there. We get home, 30 minutes later and guess what's missing? For those that don't know, the side dishes are a big part of Korean cuisine. I called when I got home and realized what was missing and no apology at all."}
{"text":"Got my vote!  Went with some Korean-speaking friends who say this is the best, and most authentic Korean restaurant in the Phoenix area. We had spicy tofu soup, octopus, BBQ beef, spicy pork and many other dishes, as well all the delicious sides that accompany. Delicious!  Delightful owners.  Will definitely return when I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic Korean food. It's even better than the ones in Korea town LA. Their jjaeyook bokeum (stir fried pork with kimchi in a spicy sauce) is the best I've ever had. All their side dishes were good too."}
{"text":"Food is just so so, definitely over priced. We've been here several times and I guess the only thing that has been ok was the service. But it got turned down today, we asked for extra kimchi THREE times and it never came, I guess the old lady who works there just keep forgetting our table. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place for years but this last couple of times the quality of food has drastically changed and so has the customer service. Probably the last time I'll be going there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service.  I came here with a big group from work for my boss's birthday. He's a big Korean food fan, and he's shown before that he makes some pretty good food choices. So I was pretty excited about the potential for this place, especially considering that I hadn't found a Korean restaurant here in Mesa just yet.  We were all sat quickly at lunchtime. Considering that there were about 12 of us, that's pretty good (and the place was mostly full). Our server was very attentive and came back regularly to make sure that we had everything we needed.  The menu is extensive. There are all sorts of choices, and there are a lot of choices that really piqued my curiosity. At some point, I'll try some of the more exotic items, but on this particular visit, I kept it rather basic and had #63 (Mae Un Dalk Bulgogi, which is Korean BBQ chicken marinated in a spicy sauce). To start, we had a few orders of #49A (Goon Mandu, which is pan-fried potstickers). And of course, there was kimchi and a variety of other sides that come with the meal.  The potstickers were tasty. A little crunchy on the outside, and with some of the sauce that comes with them, quite good. I normally don't eat many potstickers, but I had 3 of these.  The chicken comes served with white rice--nothing special about it. The chicken was nicely done. The marinade was excellent! The spice level was perfect, and the flavor was really good. I definitely enjoyed it.  But as I have often found with Korean food, the stars of the show for me were the sides. The marinated cucumbers, the kimchi, the seaweed--all excellent, all with really great flavors. Best of all are those potatoes. I don't know what they use to flavor the potatoes, but they are great! I could eat a whole plate of those potatoes, but unfortunately, they come as a small side. I'm sure that I could have asked for more, but with the size of the chicken platter (lunch portion, mind you) and the potstickers to boot, I was quite full.  To finish off the meal, there's a little dessert that I believe is a probiotic drink. It has an interesting and good, albeit a little medicine-y, taste to it. Always nice to encourage good digestion at the end of a big meal!  I'll be back. And I'll try out some of the ox knee."}
{"text":"We didn't get a chance to patron for a few years and finally we were back for lunch...nothing much change, the service is still VERY poor. It's not a busy afternoon, but we waited and waited for at least 30 mins before our food is served. People who came later then us, mostly Americans were being greeted and served PROMPTLY!  It might be the change of ownership, the food is definitely not as delicious as before, standard of their small plates of vege also goes south. Won't be going back any sooner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Been eating here for over 7 years and I guess they recently made some changes and stepped up their game. It's the little things and I love all of the condiments and side dishes. The new pork belly dish is super yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now. Although I am not a fan of their Soft Tofu, everything else seems to be well-prepared. They also have good side dishes."}
{"text":"This place is not all it's cracked up to be. I used to get good service there but now that there's a new group of employees, I try not to come by until I watch Korean drama and in need of Kimchi Chigae and Bulgogi.  I have been coming to this place for years and found it by accident because my favorite Korean restaurant went out of business.  For one of my group lunches, my friend suggest we go to Hodori. There were a group of us and I remember getting terrible service!!! We didn't leave a good tip as a result of that and the waitress actually chased us down.  Aren't tips earned?   I went back to Hodori because my friend said they're under new management, so I thought ok I'll give it another shot.  This time the service was wayyyyyyy better so I stay loyal to Hodori. I also discovered my love for Kimchi Chigae, which I thought is a simple dish of soup.  I tried looking for the recipe and duplicate it but failed every time.  So I guess I'm stuck with Kimchi Chigae.  No other restaurants make it like Hodori does.  What I would order here: Kimchi Chigae Bulgogi Kalbi  The lunch plates are quite good as well. Their side dishes used to be awesome.  They used to have these anchovies that were delish- but now the side dishes are something I don't look forward to anymore at this place.    I would come back only for the Kimchi Chigae."}
{"text":"This is my current go to place to get Korean BBQ (bulgogi).  If anyone knows of other spots, please let me know."}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best Korean BBQ restaurants in the Phoenix area. They have excellent service and the private karaoke rooms are a blast, especially if you have a group. Just be aware of the soju, it'll creep up on you."}
{"text":"The food is great (#23 spicy bulgogi is the way to go) and is usually pretty consistent (usually not too fatty). The food is pricey but it is so good (and addicting) and you can't get Korean food anywhere else in the valley like this so its worth it. My only complaint is the slow service, don't expect refills on drinks and no one really checks to see if you need anything - you have to be assertive. If you go around dinner time there will most likely be a wait but I feel like the quality of the food during this time is always better, maybe because it doesn't sit around as long."}
{"text":"YUM! For Arizona, this place is AWESOME. Seriously. It is really difficult to find any good asian food in the area and this place has wonderful food. I love the banchan and have ordered the tofu soup as well as the larger meat and seafood dishes. They were all really good. Whenever I am missing home, this is my go-to place for comfort food."}
{"text":"My husband and I don't live near the Mesa area. We live in Surprise. So, when we have the time or if we happen to be near the Mesa area, this is always the first place we stop. Love the food. We're very picky about Korean bbq. This place has not let us down. The prices look like they have gone up a little. We had to wait quite a bit to order our drinks and to order our appetizers. The service could be better. But this won't stop us from coming back. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for lunch today 01/16/2017. When we get ready to order, nobody came to us to take our orders. We tried to make eye contact with them. However, they \"could NOT\" catch our eye contact with in a couple of yards. After waited for like 15 minutes, I had to directly ask them to take our order. One male guy was busy and said with he will come back to us very soon (which actually took ~10 minutes). During those 10 minutes, my friend tried to ask another female person to take our order; however, she said \"exu...\" (not even a word...) and basically ignored us. Later on she went to take another table's order who came later than us. A bit upset. Finally, thank God, our order was taken. We did not expect that we waited for another 20+ minutes before the food is ready. Unfortunately, this is NOT the end of the story. When they gave us the check, I expected Yakult to be served as a compliment soft drink, as they gave to other tables right before us and they provided Yakult last time when I ate here. However, they did not serve us Yakult as expected. I feel I am NOT equally treated. What they did is apparently not fair. At that time, I am completely upset to them and decided will NEVER EVER come back again. Just FYI, I live in this area for 3+ YEARS and eat outside a tons of time. This is the WORST experience I had so far."}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant got a low score compared to other Korean restaurants in Phoenix.  Coming from LA ktown, this food is the most authentic korean food you can get in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Came here like 5 times. Lived about 5 minutes from this place. Great food but its kinda pricey. The service isn't the greatest during busy times because there are not enough waiters and tons of customers. Really popular place. I would take my friends here anytime."}
{"text":"My Korean friend says this is the best there is in the Phoenix area.  Based on the clientele alone I would say they must be doing something right, it is a majority Korean Americans eating in there.  All your standards are delicious, try something new, you will not be disappointed.   Another thing I love about Korean food, is I feel good after I eat it, because it seems healthier than other Asian cuisine. More vegetables I guess.  They also serve Korean wine and barley tea. Check those out."}
{"text":"I go here often and I love its location which is right next to korean market. The food is ok but not really   traditional korean food. It is bit americanized. The majority customera r non-korean... which I think they did a good job making the food attractive to those non-korean people. It is still good taste for korean people as well. The service has been upgraded and so as the price."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that the staff and waiters were nice. Now, I ordered a bulgogi soup, and it had hair in it. Wasn't proud of that at all. I changed my order to a regular bulgogi and that was good. The place was decent, nothing fancy and nothing too dirty. So overall my experience was a 2 and a half of 5."}
{"text":"My first impression of the place was pretty good. We walked in to friendly servers and lots of appetizing photos. The menu was a little messy but I appreciate the photos.   One of the best thing about going for Korean food is trying different types of kimchi. I was disappointed at the kimchi selection they serve. Only 2 were good (fish cake and pickled radish).   For my main course, I ordered their Kimchi Soon Tofu soup with pork. It was nothing out of ordinary and definitely not on my top 5 list of Soon Tofu. The tofu were in large chunks and there were barely any kimchi in the soup.  My boyfriend ordered their Daeji Bulgogi (Korean BBQ pork) and that was extremely disappointing. It feels like the one thing that can't go wrong in a Korean restaurant is BBQ but I was totally wrong. First of all, the dish took forever to be served. The pork was extremely stringy and oily. On the menu, it states that the BBQ dishes come with a lettuce plate but we did not get any.  As a lot had previously warned, the service is extremely bad. We tried to pay for our food and we were completely ignored by a server who felt that cleaning a table next to ours (while the restaurant was barely full) was more important than serving us.   My hunt for a nice Korean food in town continues. Definitely do not recommend this place if you have tried really good Korean food."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Korean food, but when I eat here, it's really pleasant. I always order the kimchi fried rice and I love the sides they provide us. I don't visit here enough to really take a gander at the staff but every time I go here, they're pretty attentive. The only big downside I have is that their prices are somewhat high. Being that I'm not so well versed on Korean food in the first place, and that the prices can build up really quickly, I don't have an incentive to order more to try. All my friends agree the price is rather high, but that's because we're all college students. lol. But all in all, it's not a bad place at all."}
{"text":"Brought my parents here and they were not impressed. However, if you make sure to just choose something safe on the menu, you should be fine. Do not order the fish egg soup or anything that sounds difficult for them to make. Basically came here out of desperation for Korean food near Tempe. Overall, disappointing especially because of the amount of overhype about this place. I know that nothing in AZ will ever compare to east coast or LA, but was still expecting better. Will keep looking for a legitimately solid Korean restaurant to make our regular place to enjoy in Phoenix."}
{"text":"On our first visit today, we enjoyed a lively atmosphere with loyal Sunday afternoon guests, attentive staff, and the tasty Hodori Special Soon Tofu Soup (soft tofu soup with beef, prawns, clams and oysters) along with a whole table full of side dishes! The pumpkin soup appetizer was a happy surprise nobody warned us about. Yum! Our server was so helpful in telling us the best way to enjoy dol pan bibim bap (assorted vegetables with kalbi on sizzling stone plate)... we added spice sauce and tossed the beautifully arranged hot pot."}
{"text":"The spicy BBQ pork was very tasty. My only suggestion though is offering lettuce on the side to wrap the meat in and also adding one or two more complementary sides. Service was friendly but it took awhile to receive our check."}
{"text":"Came here with the family after being spontaneous and not eating at the hong kong diner next door. We ordered the korean beef, two of the tofu soups, and a few other miscellaneous items. Everything was really great and had a lot of flavor, the two soups were also very very good and I would definitley recommend to a first time korean food tryer. The reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because service was just okay. Nothing special. The waiters didn't really seem to care about the food or anything. Secondly, I realized that I'm not the biggest fan of korean food, but that's just me. And third, the prices were a little high. Around $90 for a family of 4/5 (My grandma eats almost nothing XD). So, we may come back here if we're really craving korean food, but it's not \"too die for\""}
{"text":"I have never had Korean food before and I was a little skeptical about trying it...But it ended up being AMAAAAAZING! They're huge portions and very well priced! I will be sure to tell my friends and family about Hodori."}
{"text":"When comparing this place to the previous Hodori of days past it has gone down hill considerably. I have seen it's ups and downs but with changing of hands as if it were currency this place has been through a lot. The current owner who ever it maybe is doing it a little better than the others but that's not a far reach from them.   This like a few other Korean places in town specializes in Tofu stew. The stew here when it first opened many many years ago was very good. This restaurant if you think about it changed the way many Korean restaurants are done here now. The way the food is, the look and I have to say the onset of the tofu epidemic to AZ.   The stews are good right now with lots of flavor and and great portions of meat in them if you get the pork or beef. The stir fry pork bellys with spicy kimchee is my favorite and the spicy octopus stir fry is good as well.  There aren't a lot of Korean restaurants here in the valley but I have to say when Hodori is on point they are good. As far as service goes, it is a hit or miss. But what place isn't like that. I have had days where at Denny's I have spectacular service but poor service here. I just don't expect anything more from Arizona Korean restaurants since it's not like LA."}
{"text":"I walked in and it smelled like my favorite dining experiences I had while living in Seoul.  The service was fast, friendly and helpful.  EVERY SINGLE THING was authentic, delicious and SO authentic.  My first dining experience outside of Korea, eating Korean food, that was as incredible as while in Korea. A+++"}
{"text":"Great food, but maybe they didn't have enough staff to accommodate the amount of guests."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. Lunch specials are good. Need them to open one in the North Valley."}
{"text":"I love hodori! Its my number one go to korean food. Actually go to Asian food!  Love the variety of soul and bbq:)"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was not. The waitresses did not smile or whatsoever. Never refilled our drinks. Only came by once and asked \"everything good?\" .. Probably will not drive from school to just come to eat here agin."}
{"text":"The Korean food in Phoenix! In my former hometown of Mesa, even! This area of town sports a small, but growing \"Korea Town\" along with the food. Go for the bibimbap, stay for the broad selection of well prepared Korean dishes that can be paired with a broad selection of wines, beers and Soju. Try the Pajun and the spicy squid!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. But 4 stars because I asked for extra meat in my dish and I got extra rice instead."}
{"text":"OK, so I grew up in Japan. Had bim bim bop which my first korean food. It was japanese style in hot iron bowl and had raw egg on top. The beauty of having baked iron is you can cook it as you wish. Raw meats on top and vegetables and stir it as fast you like. Not sure how they do it in Korea but super good food went back for two bowls in one sitting.  Anywhore, Hodori came very close to when I live in Japan. Waitress, nice as heaven spoke to me in Japanese when I was speaking in Chinese to my friend. She was soooo nice. The food, too well! And I filled up on soju! If I could get the same waiter and soju, coming back again! But it's always too packed! Expand please!"}
{"text":"A mighty fine place: the banchans, soondobu, panjul [seafood pancake] the best i;ve had-- better than the koreans places in NYC."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd favorite Korean restaurant in the area.  Happy hour is from 3pm to 6 pm and they had appetizers.  We got the Potstickers which were amazing.  Kimchi was fabulous and the Bulgogi was good.  The meat was very tender.  The fish cakes were a little too fishy for my liking.  We also had Kimchi fried rice which was a first.  We enjoyed out and thought it was quite good.  Very friendly staff and very clean."}
{"text":"Took 5 minutes to get a menu.  Another 5 to get our drinks.  We ordered what we always order at our favorite Korean place which is the Bulgogi, and mushroom tofu soup.  I figured these are very popular dishes, and easy measuring sticks to compare different places.  They give complimentary salad which includes iceberg lettuce... and teriyaki sauce.  No thanks.    Bulgogi:  Really wasn't good at all.  It was too thick, the onions were 100% raw and there was no flavor beyond intense onion and poorly bbq'd beef.  It should be THIN, and TENDER, and FLAVORFUL.  Failed in all aspects  Tofu Soup:  Server asked how spicy we wanted it, and we said normal.  Apparently that means zero spicy or just adding 3 jalapeno slices into the soup.  That's authentic right?  They also use a very runny type of tofu, not the more firm stuff I have and like at my other spot.  It really had the texture of egg whites.  In fact, it had the exact texture of the egg white that was also in the soup.  So it was just watery flavorless broth, with textureless tofu and textureless egg b/c it wasn't hot enough to properly cook the egg.  Factor in the tough mushrooms that were obviously re-hydrated and you have a very poor dish.    They stiffed us bowls or plates, unless they expected us to reuse the salad bowls so we had to wait around for a while to ask for something to eat on.  They also brought the dishes out at different times which is bad form.    The best and worst parts were actually the sides.  What the hell are those shrimp, and why are they on my table?  They were dis-gus-ting.  Kimchi didn't taste fresh, bean things weren't that good, bean sprouts were too mature to be good and the cucumber thing probably sat around too long and got soggy like cucumbers like to do.  The daikon kimchi was the only solid side.      My go to place is Cho Dang in Chandler for my Korean BBQ.  It blows this place away on all levels.  Their meat is of much higher quality, they actually include stone rice with their soup, serve amazing sides, and the atmosphere is a lot less cafeteria like.   To top it off it is about $5 less for the same exact order, but with larger portions of sides, rice, and meals.  Really isn't a whole lot of good to say about this place.  I'd give it 1.5 stars, not quite bad enough to get a 1, but certainly not good enough to simply earn a \"meh\" rating.  I actually started this review by giving them 2 stars but as I started writing I realized there really wasn't anything positive I took away from the experience.  Couldn't even get an iced tea refill for the last 10+ minutes we were there.  Guess I'll still have to drive 15 minutes down to Chandler rather than 5 minutes to Mesa for Hodori."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times. I didn't want to base my review off one experience. But each time the food was very bland, the servers are a bunch of disrespectful college brats who roll their eyes at you if you don't want your noodles cut for you. I know, weird. I really wanted to like this place, but I will stick with Chodang in Chandler."}
{"text":"Korean restaurants are all varied, ranging from the ones where you cook your own food, to those where they cook the food in the kitchen and bring it to you. Hodori is of the later type.  We were a group of about 12, and were seated in a room away from the main stream area. As it turned out, this was good, since our group was a bit noisy.  One of the dishes ordered was Korean soup. This is brought out boiling in a bowl, with a raw egg dropped into it at the last minute to cook in the broth. Satisfying and wonderful in flavor. Another of our party ordered Bibim Bap. A dish that is cooked in a red hot stone bowl consisting of rice, veggies and meat, with a sauce that you add to your taste. Again, this was an excellent dish.  The Bulgogi and Galbi are excellent even though they are cooked in the kitchen. An assortment of condiments including some excellent kimchi (homemade perhaps) was served with it.  My only complaint is that each time I have come here I have ordered an Obi beer, and each time, they tell me they are sold out.  Oh well, if this is the only problem, then they are doing well.  At the risk of sounding prejudiced (which I am not), I noticed the most of the patrons of the restaurant were Korean. This tells me that the food is authentic and appeals to those who know real Korean food.  Service was reasonably fast, and the place was nicely clean.  4 stars"}
{"text":"Good bulgogi, and a spicy octopus platter I forgot the name of.  I'd visit again, but my eyes tear whenever I walk into the place- not their fault I'm allergic to *."}
{"text":"We had T1 and 27 for lunch today :-P Friendly and great food. Def will be back"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Rounded down for service.  They didn't bring the side dishes until the food came out which was disappointing. The seafood pancake was okay for AZ and the side dishes weren't bad. It's probably the best Korean restaurant that we have been to so far, although in the big picture, it's just average."}
{"text":"When it comes to finding good Korean food in AZ there aren't too many choices. This is my go-to place because they offer a variety of dishes so whatever Korean dish I'm craving, I can find it here. What I always get: Kimchi fried rice, kimchi soft tofu stew with beef, sul lung tang (I call it well-being soup because it makes me feel better when I'm sick), and kalbi. Kalbi and the other bbq's here are so expensive! But I don't know AZ prices....I only know LA prices where these dishes are so much cheaper. But the kalbi marinade they use did taste really good and came out sizzling on an iron plate over onions. Order the tofu soup spicy - it really isn't spicy and more like medium. When you need service, raise your hand and look at the server because that is more customary for traditional Korean restaurants (actually Koreans raise their hands and yell out \"here\" in Korean..haha). I need to try the rest of the menu but I always get the same stuff because I know what I like and I crave it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Korean bbq dishes, perfectly cooked with a deep smokey flavor in each bbq bite.  They also have good seafood pancake (haemul pajeon) and decent tofu soups."}
{"text":"Korean food is definitely one of my favorites and I was happy to find a solid place in the valley.   My go-to usually Kimchi Beef tofu soup, which is perfect on child days, but also enjoyed the bibimbap, and kalbi. Side dishes were good, but portions were a little small (more cucumber Kimchi!).   No issues with the service."}
{"text":"I heart Hodori.   This is the best Korean place I've found in Arizona. We ordered the Daeji Bulgogi (BBQ pork) and Nakji Bokum (Sauteed octopus). The octopus was spicy and the pork was sizzling when it came out of the kitchen.   Our waiter barely spoke English (a good sign of an authentic restaurant), but gladly obliged when we kept asking for extra side-dishes. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get a tofu side (usually a Korean restaurant staple), but they had my favorite: thinly sliced radish! OH YEAH!!!"}
{"text":"The ban chan here is one of my all time faves out of the local Korean restaurants. Food is delicious and service, albeit nothing special, good! Always make sure to ask for the bori cha"}
{"text":"if you are craving korean food in the middle of the desert aka arizona, Hodori will do.  the food was your lower end quality korean food.  the restaurant used a lot of msg but that's what makes the food taste good so it was fine...for one meal.  some of the dishes were outrageously expensive such as jabche (stir-fried vermicelli with vegetables) and hehmoolpahjun (seafood pancakes) for about $15 each.  the lunch menu was reasonable around $10 per meal [main dish + bowl of rice + ban chan (side dishes)].  the servings were average but refills on the banchans were generous.  the servers were kind and the atmosphere was comfortable.  after 3 days without korean food, Hodori hit the spot.  however, i'd have liked it so much more if the cook used less msg and patiently simmered beef / pork / chicken for broth.  i'd like to see korean restaurants step it up and preserve traditional quality korean cooking ...even in the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants. I stop by here at least once every two weeks and the food is always amazing! The servers are quite attentive and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"I am not a regular but the food and service have been outstanding on all of my visits.  The bulgogi is the best I have had in Arizona."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this restaurant. Authentic Korean food. Service is amazing. We are always offered side dish refills. Water refills are promptly provided.   Daeji bulgogi is amazing. You have to try it.   Bulgogi is good, but we prefer the daeji bulgogi.   Seulongtang is delicious.  Duk mandooguk is delicious.  Haemul Pajun is delicious too and pretty huge portion. Good for 3-4  people.   They also provide a sweet drink at the end."}
{"text":"Best korean restaurant in Az, my best friend I have been going here for 6+ yrs pretty much regulars :). They have the best potstickers ever :), we order them every time we go. The food is very well seasoned & the side dishes are delicious. The staff is really nice, but the service could be just a smidge better when it comes to refilling beverages, sometimes we wait awhile to get our drinks refilled, only flaw. I would definitely recommend this place for some good korean food :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this restaurant since I've hear numerous Koreans talk how good this place is.  I got the tofu soup which hit the spot. You can ask them to adjust the spice level to your liking. The banchan was good and I really appreciate the wonderful service, where they ask if you'd like some more of a certain dish. They aren't stingy with their side which is much appreciated!  FYI. They don't take Amex."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Korean restaurant in Tempe-Mesa. Kimchi pancake with pork, and soon tofu hot pot are my favorite two dishes. It is real Korean taste in Hodori. My friends and i come there several times a week.   However, the decorations in Hodori need to be more \"Korean\". The soup in casserole is little bit weird.  Overall, Hodori Restaurant is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Good Korean food makes me happy. This place makes some damn good Korean BBQ, so yes, Hodori makes me happy. Not everything they make is that great, but every single one of their signature BBQ dishes are amazing. New Times magazine, the Arizona Republic, and Phoenix magazine all rave about this place, and I must admit that I rave about it to people. The food is just so good, and the portions are so BIG even Adam Richmond would need a to-go box.  Now I'm no expert, but this place seems really authentic. I've been to a number of Korean restaurants in southern Cali, and this place is one of the most \"Korean\" that I've been to. Being on Dobson, it's right in the heart of the Asian community of Mesa. Smartly, they're not just another Asian food joint a mile up by Mekong palace and they're located right by MCC and the hospital right off both the US60 and the 101. Easily in contention for the best Korean in the Phoenix valley, Hodori is a must try for anyone in the metro area."}
{"text":"I was in the area and asked a friend if they had good soup, and he replied.. \"the T2\" is good.  I didn't know what a T2 was, but i decided to go anyways.. while i looked over the menu i saw that they had Kimchi Chigae and ordered that.  I was not disappointed, it was really really good.. full of flavor and all the banchan (side dishes) they gave me were fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Good Korean food but spotty service. If you're not Korean the staff can be less attentive to you it seems. Whenever I go there it always takes the servers at least 5-10 minutes to show up and take your drink orders. Word of advice don't finish your drink too fast because the servers will rarely come by with a refill!  Service aside, their food quality is better than most Korean places in the area. Some of the items on the menu may look pricey but they give generous portions."}
{"text":"Terribly old decor looks like it wasn't renovated from the middle of the last century. No booths, uncomfortable tables and chairs. Pictures of menu items with prices make you feel like you're in cheap Chinese take-out restaurant. Well, Chinese take-out is at least cheap.  I had chok kalbi. Cured vegetables, kalbi comes with, are disgusting and inedible. The meat was so unchewably hard and unreasonably priced for the low quality."}
{"text":"Honestly, the most modest Korean food in town. The flavor of the dish feel very close to what I could get in the Korea Town in CA. I enjoy coming here occasionally to satisfy my Korean cravings. I particularly would recommend the tofu soups. Also try their Bori rice. As them for one, it's a different kind of rice that Koreans enjoy eating with the side dishes. :)"}
{"text":"Uhhhh--Yep. You should go here. Now.  Haseyo to come in. Haseyo when you leave. Chicken or whatever in the middle. Oh yes. My expectations were perfect and so was the soup. No blue walls like I've seen most places. Existential onions (and no need to get them on the side) and there were only like two millennials there! (Woo!)"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Korean food and it was delicious. For an appetizer, we got the kimchi pancake (it's a large portion size so you can split with a couple friends). For my entree, I got the bulgogi (beef with veggies in a noodly soup). The portions sizes were generous as well. It came with a bunch of mini, appetizing sides including kimchi, fish cake, coleslaw, sweet potato, and a small bowl of rice. When our check came, we each got a complimentary mini yogurt drink. Overall, the food was great and the customer service was excellent as well. There's ample seating and a parking lot (located in complex with Asiana)."}
{"text":"I was having a strong craving for korean tofu soup. It was ok, their soup is enough to get me by until I have to go back to So Cal for some BCD. I got the assorted special, there were a lot of clams in it.  The bibimbap we ordered was tasteless, the sauce it came with just kept making it taste weirder as we added more.  We had to opt for some soy sauce with the rice at the end."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in the East Valley, have tried all the others in hopes to find one closer to Chandler/Gilbert area but I can't find one to match Hodori"}
{"text":"Service was super slow. They said they took my order but they didnt get the food that i orsered. Dumplings are frozen dumplings from asian market. Theres literly no meat inside the dumpling."}
{"text":"Very good Korean food.  The lunch specials are excellent and they don't mess around with the spices.  The side dishes are all very good.  I'm coming back for dinner with an appetite."}
{"text":"From the few Korean restaurants my boyfriend and I have been too, we like coming here.. I always order one of their tofu soups and my boyfriend likes their Korean BBQ entrees better than other restaurants.. I just wish their service was a lil better bc when we came here for lunch around 1pm not a lot of ppl were here but it still took awhile to get a water refill and more side dishes.."}
{"text":"Its alright.... the seafood hot pot is not enticing at all. The chicken grill is bad choice for us as well. I taste nothing but salty overly done chicken meat.  Daorea serving is so much better... larger side dishes served as well.  come to penang and I will show you what is good korean food"}
{"text":"Service was slow, it took forever to bring the food. The waiter had poor English, couldn't even explain menu options, what it is made of, he didn't understand our needs. When food arrived, it wasn't what we expected and it didn't taste right. They refused to exchange the meal when we asked. The bill was too high and we left not even full. Worst experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Came back for lunch with a friend.  I ordered the kalbi tang, he got the naeng myun and a side order of kalbi.  Like I wrote before, everything was fine.  There was less meat in the kalbi tang than usual, and the largest piece was not kalbi meat but either from the neck or foot.  The naeng myun and kalbi, again fine.  The meat was a little fatty, both for the kalbi and kalbi tang.  The ban chan were good, nothing special.  Solid lunch, not bad for $10 (for the kalbi tang alone.)"}
{"text":"I brought some Arabians here. They never experienced Korean food, or even held chop sticks.  The waiter taught them how to use chopsticks. And the guys fell in love with both the Korean women there, and the bulgogi.   I have converted them from Islamic to Bulgogi-ists."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent Korean restaurant around town.  I finally had the LOVELY kimchi taste in my mouth once again.  The menu is a bit over priced but the food is great.  Nothing like LA but it's acceptable.    I've been to Hodori numerous times and got exceptional service every time.  All the FOH staff has a smile on their faces and extremely polite.  The portion sizes are fairly big so one order could probably fill up two people."}
{"text":"Consistently on point! I crave this place and it always delivers. Everything from the hot pot, kimchi fried rice to the bulgogi and all of the delicious condiments keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Super server. One woman ran the counter and the other took care of a pretty good number of lunch customers. I was impressed.   Food was good...not the best Korean I've head, but yummy. Lunch prices are very good, while dinner prices seemed high. I'd have to see the portions to judge for sure. If you like Korean BBQ try the $11.95 meat sampler.   I imagine a lot here depends on who is working on any given day. If they only schedule two people for lunch rush I could see an eitely different review."}
{"text":"The Korean Restaurant 1116 S Dobson Rd Mesa, AZ 85202 480-668-7979 I usually come to hodori much times, that's a good choice for us. this restaurant established in 2002 Korean food more and more popular in this modern society, specially to Asian, the Korean food including spicy and light taste, that's can meat different customer requirement. Korean food have delicious taste, and use healthy food, like vegetable, meat, etc, that's all good for our body. Actually it lower calories than American food. When I traveled each cities, I must be Korean restaurant, like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Los Vegas, Korea town is much popular in city, so I try to the much Korean food, I think Hodori is the best restaurant in Arizona, the taste is almost similar in Korean traditional food when I traveled in Korea. Lots of Korean restaurants in US are all varied, ranging from the ones where you cook your own food, to those where they cook the food in the kitchen and bring it to you. Hodori is of the second type. Our friends were seated in a room away from the main stream area. As it turned out, this was good. We started off with seafood pancake as an appetizer.  The pancake tasted good; however, it did not have enough seafood in it. The next one we ordered was japche, which had great flavor. Main dishes were grilled Kalbi and spicy sautéed octopus. Kalbi tasted great. Everyone enjoyed the great flavor of the spicy octopus that was cooked in cabbage and onions.  But I should have ordered squid instead.  Even though the flavor was great the octopus was a little chewy. Our friends also learned to make a lettuce wrap and enjoyed it very much. my favorite food is seafood Toufu soup.  One of the dishes ordered was Korean soup. This is brought out boiling in a bowl, with a raw egg dropped into it at the last minute to cook in the broth. Satisfying and wonderful in flavor. Another of our party ordered Bibim Bap. A dish that is cooked in a red hot stone bowl consisting of rice, veggies and meat, with a sauce that you add to your taste. Again, this was an excellent dish. The Bulgogi and Galbi are excellent even though they are cooked in the kitchen. An assortment of condiments including some excellent homemade kimchi was served with it. This place is truly authentic Korean food. It's even better than the ones in Korea town LA. Their jjaeyook bokeum (stir fried pork with kimchi in a spicy sauce) is the best I've ever had. All their side dishes were good too. But if you come to here in busy period of time, we have been wait for long time, so I hope can recruitment more waiters, that's will be high work quality. As a lot had previously warned, the service is extremely bad. We tried to pay for our food and we were completely ignored by a server who felt that cleaning a table next to ours (while the restaurant was barely full) was more important than serving us.  Overall, I also recommend this restaurant, that's the best Korean food choice in Arizona. (words 508.)"}
{"text":"This is where I come to get some good old Korean food. I have tried their tofu soups and their jap chei (I don't know how to spell this). Their tofu soup is offered with a variety of meats, kimchi, seafoods, and vegetables. I tend to get their vegetarian one that has seaweed, kimchi, and mushrooms. It tastes great. The jap chei (wrong spelling!) is vermicelli noodles with meat and veggies. It is also very good. The best part about this place are the side dishes. They always give you a lot and they taste great, except when they put something american in there like sliced hot dogs. The service is also great and I love the endless supply of side dishes. You get a lot of good healthy food for a small price. Their tofu soups are around $8.95 and come with rice and all the sides. Their bbq is a bit more expensive though. They also have these delightful coffee candies they give you with the bill."}
{"text":"One of the best Koran restaurant in tempe for sure, love their tofu soup, especially winter also the BBQ pork is good too!"}
{"text":"This is a really good Korean restraunt, went with a big group and everything was taken care of, I didn't give it 5 stars because they forgot my brothers order somehow and I didn't like how their bugolgi was marinated but everything else was great. Will definitely come back when I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Ordered the soft tofu soup with beef and potstickers. The potstickers were good, had the burnt flavor on the bottom and crunchiness was there. The soup I was not too impress with it. It was sour and spicy but more on the sour side I thought. The meat was cutup into tiny pieces (like bacon bit pieces, maybe slightly bigger) and thrown in, so not slices or chunks. I couldn't really taste it. Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali, San Francisco Bay Area to be exact and this place has the best Korean BBQ. I love their lunch special that comes with 3 different meat. Spicy pork is definitely my fav and yes so good that I find myself craving it on a weekly basis. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"My husband have enjoyed dining at Hodori the last five years. During the last year or two the menu and service have changed drastically it seems.   Today we arrived and were shocked to see the menu prices. $17.99 for spicy pork?! Okay, I'll let it slide because of the tasty side dishes that accompany the entree. They usually serve some of our favorites and are greatly varied.   Except today... we received two weird seaweed dishes, two dishes both made from cucumber, sour kimchi and 4 small pieces of potatoes. Four.  Both of our dishes tasted less appetizing than usual. I ate a few bites of mine but the pork is so heavily marinated that it stands no chance at caramelizing, so the texture as a protein was very unappealing for me. It was almost slimy. It was nowhere near $18 of tasty.   Service is where I lost it. Water refills 15 minutes plus. When it's a 6oz glass of water, leave a pitcher damn.  As I said having enjoyed Hodori for five years; we have definitely lost loyalty to this restaurant. Our bill for two enjoying potsickers and two entrees was $47. Many Valley restaurants can accommodate a more appetizing menu and more welcoming service."}
{"text":"No longer a Korean Cuisine Virgin . . . and even though I have nothing to compare this place too . . . it was fabulous.  First the Service . . . Seating quickly and our drink order was taken immediately.  When the waitor return with the drinks, he walked us through their menu . . . pointing out his favorite dishes . . . but more importantly . . . helping us decide between the two  dishes we were interested in . . . this is great since at that point I was still a korean cuisine virgin.  My choice . . . with my wiater's recommendation . . . Nakji Dol Pan . . . Octopus stir fried in a spicy sauce and served on a sizzling stone plate.  Second the Food . . . the food came quickly and was unbelievable . . . though spicy, not too spicy . . . however, the spiciness does grow on you over time.  The octopus, was cooked perfectly and almost melted in your mouth . . . and the side enhanced the overall taste of the dish.  I will now definately try other Korean Restaurants . . . but it will be hard to surpass the experience I have here at Hodori Restaurant."}
{"text":"The people here are great and food are great too. Loving coming here for there BBQ and soup."}
{"text":"Love the seafood pancake and tofu stew here! Side dishes are awesome as well! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 10+ years now~ the staff has always been superb and friendly, and the food consistent. The prices are reasonable ~ I can go to Chili's and get two meals which would cost $50 for the two of us or dinner for two here at $27.   It's healthy to the alternative as well! Not saying it's the healthiest choice but you eat a lot of veggies and get your proteins in as well.   I absolutely love it and hope it will be one of the long standing restaurants."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Korean restaurants in Phoenix.  The food is great.  When most of the customers that are in the restaurant are Korean I know I am in the right place.  Food is served hot and side dishes are fresh.  Ipersonally love the Kim Chi soup.  This is our go to place for Korean bbq and Korean soup.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Hodori since theyve opened. They use to be amazing at the beginning, but then after it changed owners, it started to go down hill. It was getting progressively worse for awhile, but lately things have changed. Foods been tastier, service is good, and they are always busy. I usually always only get the Beef and Mushroom tofu stew. It usually hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I pretty much now come here regularly for the soft tofu, beef & kimchi soup. It really is fantastic. One day I'll branch out and try other foods, but for now, the tofu soup is what I need."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a traditional Korean restaurant in the east valley when we stumbled upon this place. Went in on a Friday night and the place was about half full of customers. We were shortly waived over to a table and ordered our drinks a few minutes later. After looking at the menu we saw that the prices were a little steep so we figured either the portions were huge or the quality would be out of this world. Well.... we got neither. Both my boyfriend and I love bulgogi so I ordered the bulgogi hot pot and he ordered the traditional bulgogi.   Food got to us fairly quickly and we saw that the portion size was lacking. When we tasted the dishes the flavor was very mediocre. Not bad, just kinda blah. The meet was mostly fat and not very tender as bulgogi should be. The flavor was too sweet and not enough spice to it. As for the side dishes that come with the meal they were all just as bland and boring. Most Korean restaurants bring tons of little things to try but here there were only 5.  All in all the service was good but the food left us unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Great Korean food - super pleased to have found this restaurant in Mesa, AZ of all places! Service was a touch slow so I can see how when it's busier some people may get impatient, but we didn't mind. We had bimimbap, soon tofu soup and traditional bulgogi and the kids split a kids bulgogi (which was even better than the traditional). Thought we'd have leftovers but we ate every last morsel. Will be back."}
{"text":"We used to go to Takamtsu on Arizona Ave and was never disappointed. Then, they changed owner and food quality is not as good anymore. A friend of us told us about Hodori, so we decided to give it a try. OMG, it was the worst dinning experience we had for a long time. First, bad service; you seat yourself and wait. The two waitresses were running like crazy. Good luck on getting their attention if you want your water refilled. The price is at least one third higher than Takantsu, but the potion is at least one third less. The seafood pancake had only a couple of tiny shrimps in it. My husband was stationed in Korea for years and knows Korean food very well. Koreans are known for garlic loving, but non of the dishes we ordered had garlic in them. That was a big surprise and a big disappointment also. With no drinks, one 4 inch seafood pancakes and  clear noodle (which they call appetizer) and one dish to share, our bill came over $40. Well, I guess before we find another Korean restaurant, if we really want Korean food, we just have to go back to Takamtsu again."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. menu not big enough for me. pretty blah.  Soju (like Korean vodka) was the best part.. that shit will have you walking around in the streets with yo' pants off.                                            *you....have.been.warned.*"}
{"text":"We had the kimchi pancake, spicy pork, and galbi. All of it was good including all the side dishes. I just thought it was pricey for all of it. I know it's not LA but still, pretty expensive. Service was good. They spoke English really well so it was super easy to order. Our water cups were never empty so I was pumped about that"}
{"text":"I'm here with my best friend for dinner.  Since I'm sick I wanted to come here for the soup. I ordered the kimchi chigae, kalbi, and my friend ordered the soon Soup.  Everything was delicious!! This is my favorite Korean spot in Arizona..   The customer service sucks tho. It was busy and they seem short on staff. We finished our dinner and didn't even get a refill on drinks or even our side dishes. We needed napkins too and there's no server to be found."}
{"text":"First of all im Korean American so I know how the system works at korean restaurant... ok this is the deal: the service is 0/5 it took them 10 min before they gave me the water and at least another 5min to take the order... there were 4 tables and 5 servers total... they don't smile and just told me to wait when I asked for more service The food is 0/5 this place is basically msg heaven Well not recommended for Korean foodies"}
{"text":"Korean food is scary to me with all the fermented things and the ubiquity of meat, which I'm not a fan of. However, I've ALWAYS left with a huge food baby after eating at Hodori!   Because I do not like meat, I have usually gotten the regular bibimbap with tofu. I just pick out the bean sprouts and bracken fern stems and ask him to pop my yolk so my fried egg is fully cooked. I douse it in gochujang and chow down. So satisfying.   Recently I've tried the soon tofu soup with mushroom. It's really, really mushroomy. The regular spice has no spice at all, but the spicy is damn good. I put gochujang in mine, because I think it gives it a better flavour. The mushrooms they use are chewy and substantial. It's really good, but I wish they would put other veggies in it considering it is a vegetarian soup.   Their side dishes are good as well. I don't eat the fish cake nor do I eat the kimchi, but my friends have said the kimchi is good. My favourites are the potato and the cucumber ban chan.   My friend always gets the beef soon tofu soup and loves it. My gf has gotten the seafood soon tofu soup and liked it. Their summer special is a ginseng chicken dish. My gf got it last week and really enjoyed it.   I'll be back for their Korean wine tasting!"}
{"text":"When I ask if tofu can be substituted for Kalbi, I'm not saying, \"Is it possible?\" Obviously it is, and that's what I want, so don't say, \"No, we can't do that\". Yes. Yes you can.  That micro-altercation aside, the food was overpriced and pretty bland. I (shamefully) dumped half the kimchi sauces in my Dol Pan Bibimbap (which literally translates to stone plate mixed meal.. it's composed of mushrooms, spinach, egg, bean sprouts, and carrots over rice on a hot plate-bowl), which then became palatable, but nothing special. On the upside, the vegetables were fresh and plentiful, but the rice didn't even get crispy, which is the best part of rice in hot stone dishes.. and there was no tofu to mix it with, which means I'll be going elsewhere because a) Dol Sot  is better than Dol Pan and b) No other restaurant tells a customer straight \"No.\""}
{"text":"Tried this place for the fist time today and I think I'm in trouble. The food was SO good, the staff SO pleasant that I'm gonna be driving back to Mesa just to eat here.  I'm new to Korean cuisine so the waitress suggested the octopus hot plate which was SO good but I couldn't even put a dent in it after devouring the accompanying side dishes!  I'm already making plans on my next visit. It's well worth the drive in the summer heat for food this good!!"}
{"text":"Hummm I had no poblem with the service that other people mentioned here.   It was a relatively busy Wednesday evening when I walked in (just me) craving some korean goodness.  I was greeted and seated promptly.     After a short wait I ordered a Heit (beer) and the Kalbi (shortribs).  I  found it a bit pricy at 19.95 for the kalbi but I  had enough for 2 people  including the dishes they serve to accompany your entree. So that lessened the sting a bit. The kalbi came sizzling on a bed of onions. Well marinaded and very tasty.  I couldn't get enough of the kimchi or the dakon or that tofu or the potatoes....yum it was all quite good.   As it is next to one of my favorite places to pick up a boba drink (The Street) there is no doubt I will be here again.  Maybe during Happy Hour when they offer food and drink specials."}
{"text":"Get the kimchi fried rice....almost like a bibimbap...with the hot pot and egg. I would not get the cod soup....the fish eggs are not that great. Other that good place to see asians enjoy a good meal"}
{"text":"This place was packed on Friday night! Every table was full of happy people getting their kbbq on! It smelt amazing from the get go and we were excited to eat some good Korean food.   We got the daeji bulgogi and the seafood tofu soup. The tofu soup was just the right spice and warmed our bellies. The meat came out sizzling and tasted sweet and spicy. I wished that the meat was cooked a little longer because I like a little char, but still yummy! The only downside was the side dishes. There were only a few that I liked: kimchi, seaweed and the fish cakes. The others were not as exciting like cole slaw and stuff. Not a huge deal though.   I was still really happy with the food and would come back again!"}
{"text":"I truly recommend Hodori restaurant for some authentic Korean food. The service is great, the servers very friendly and their customer service is awesome.  This was my second time visiting this restaurant and I am looking forward for my third one. Just amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"If your korean it's doable  taste but not stellar but can't complain I think not many choices in Phoenix area. It just tasted bland and soup was soso. I am so use to good korean food in wa and LA..service was excellent and fast!"}
{"text":"First time dinner at Korean restaurant but totally dissapointed the hot pot is pale like saliva, crab is dead, stinky, spicy hot pot not spicy at all ... i definitely never come back. Its not worth the price $35 , I think food here better to torture murder crimes."}
{"text":"Service is so bad. Place is running slow .. Can't believe it, and take long time to have the order coming."}
{"text":"Omg so good! We went for my fiance's birthday, and I used the leftovers to make fried rice for lunch today. It was awesome. We went last night right before 6 thinking we would make it before the dinner rush. Turns out Koreans eat early and we got there DURING the rush! We didn't have to wait very long to be seated but it took forever to order, get our food, pay the bill, etc. They only had three ladies waitressing, running the register, and so on. Our water glasses were never filled. Well at least the food was good.   The Bulgogi had great flavor and was very tender. The entree was pricey (normal for ribeye to expensive at KBBQ places) but they gave us a huge portion so we ate it last night and today too. The Soon tofu was delicious and packed with tofu, kimchee, tender cubes of beef and seaweed. We asked for medium spicy and it was quite spicy! We can handle spice but for those who can't, I recommend you get it as mild as possible. Definitely loved the soup, I will be back for this one! Lastly the seafood pancake was packed with baby shrimp, octopus, scallion, and mushrooms. It was good but got soggy pretty quickly unfortunately. But when served hot in crispy its yummy dipped into the tangy sauce they serve with it. Banchan was unimpressive and limited, the potato side dish was too sweet (I think they put syrup on it) and the kimchee was just okay. I prefer the seafood pancake and banchan at Cafe Ga Hyang more . Overall we were very satisfied with the meat and soon tofu and will be back if we're in the area!  Minus a star for the lacking banchan and slow service."}
{"text":"Pretty good Korean food.... IMO.  I lived in Korea Town, Los Angeles for a few years and would walk to our local souju spots and our local Korean BBQ spots with great frequency, so I ate a lot of Korean food.  This place is about as good as the Hodori in Los Angeles, which I would rate 3 stars, but this place gets 4 being in the middle of the desert with little else to compare.  Hodori, LA is literally surrounded by 100 other KBBQ spots.  Anyway, service is whatever..... nothing special, which is to be expected at a Korean establishment.  Sides are pretty good and they are good about refilling them.  Two of us usually share one bbq dish and are perfectly full at the end after devouring the meal with all the sides.  Oh, and a good boba spot is right next door... kbbq then boba, ftw!"}
{"text":"I love their tofu soups.  They are a bit expensive but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back again.  This place was recommended to me by someone.  I ordered the T1 (the tofu soup with beef, oysters, pawns, etc) with mild spiciness.   When the tofu soup came, the lady asked if I wanted an egg in it. She cracked an egg in it as the soup sizzle.   I tried the soup. It was good. The tofu was fresh and soft. LOTS of tofu in my soup. However, there wasn't much of the other ingredients - where's all my oysters? One pawn? :( There's little chucks of beef. I wanted more of the other ingredients.   The side dishes came out at the same time as the main entree. There's lots of side dishes. When I came, they didn't have the little fish ones I like. :(   Service was slow in giving us our check and follow up on our meal but what do you expect? It is an Asian restaurant where I don't expect quality service.  Overall, decent pricing for the items on the menu. LOTS of options on the menu - I was surprised to see casseroles, bossom, etc. I like that it has everything! Parking is easy. The place is relatively large. It is in a complex with other asian stores. It doesn't look like it's in the best neighborhood in town but it's hard to tell when it's dark.   Come here if you like authentic Korean food because there's not lots of places in Arizona for actual Korean food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both like Korean food.  We went to Hodori for the first time yesterday.  The food we ordered was very good.  The last time we went to a Korean restaurant worth mentioning was a place in Nashville TN (Antioch TN) called Hai Woon Dae.  This place ranks comparable to that.    I ordered Dalk Bulgogi (Chicken Bulgogi), and it was good.  The chicken tasted very fresh.    My wife ordered Soon tofu with pork.  She liked the soup.    All of the common sides that were brought out to us were very good also from the kimchi, to the eggplant, to the bean sprouts.  My wife and I will go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The quality of the food was really good. My only complaint is the time it takes to get your order placed. It almost seemed like we were seated, waited 10 min to be given a beverage, waited another 5-10 min to order, and another 10 min for our food. The whole process was extremely time consuming compared to their competitors. However I rate this restaurant highly bc the food quality is just really good."}
{"text":"Banchans (side dishes) are must with Korean meals and they will gladly filled them for you if you needed more.  The owner is a young man who gives extremely attentive service to all customers and periodically will go on shopping trip to bring unique dishes to Phoenix from California.  It is filled with Korean patrons which equate to gold seal of approval.  Since I am a royal regulars, the servers are very nice to me now (It didn't used to be the case) and they do offer the best Sam Gai Tang (Ginseng Chicken Soup) for the summer which boils in front of you on a hot clay pot.  Never order it to go.  Asian food is foul if you don't eat it right away."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service was good, considering how busy the restaurant was.  We ordered the bibimbop, bulgogi and potstickers.  All were very good.  They were very generous with their portions."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I drop by here to grab some food & ususlly ok. But today was just horrible!!!  It is a huge disappointment to see this restaurant struggling with services, let alone inconsistancy of food.  Pork blood plate (soon dae) was so dried & hard it was slmist difficult to eat.  There were enough (4) servers & at leat 7 tables empty but forget sitting people...they don't even know who came in first. Servers were all over the place, if not standing & look around. Not sure at what...??? Took 17 minutes for our drinks & serves huge cup to a 5 year old kid but tiny cup to adults. Rice that comes with the soup difn't come out when asked for it, never got it. Went up to the server section to get it & the server said she'll bring it never got it. Went up again & asked I take it myself if they didn't mind. Total time to dine in was 2 hours & 13 minutes. Usually with full restaurant, we would be out in 1 hour & 30 minutes at max. Gave 2 star because stirfry squid was really good with great portion."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG Korean BBQ!  This is the first place I ever tried any sort of Korean BBQ and it's by far my favorite.  I think based on the fact that everyone else in the restaurant except for my wife and son were speaking Korean that this is a pretty authentic place.  Oh, and the menu is mostly in Korean too, and even the parts that are English don't really make much sense and some of the descriptions are horrifying to my uneducated ignorant eyes (you'll know when you see them).  Fortunately there's lots of pictures and I picked the simple Chicken BBQ plate and whooo boy it's super awesome fantastic.  The serving staff all speak English and are really helpful in telling you what is what, but all you need to know is to order BBQ Chicken, Pork or Beef and you'll be happy.    After ordering the server will bring over 8 or 9 little dishes each filled with some sort of Korean appetizer.  There's lots of Kim Chi which I'm told is excellent, but I'm a coward.  The potatoes, though were excellent as were several other things that I tried.  If you finish any of the little bowls you can ask for more at no charge.    When the meal comes out you're in a for a great treat!  Each plate comes out sizzling like when you get fajitas.  They're piled high (really high) with your choice of seasoned meat and onions.  And they also give you a big bowl of rice.    Each bite is heaven.  Oh man, just thinking about it right now just before lunch is driving me insane.  I think I'm going to have to drag Lindsay down there tomorrow night.  We love bringing our friends here.  Hodori is tucked away in a strip mall full of other Asian stores and restaurants.  Its decor is blah, but the staff is nice.  If you're not Korean, don't be surprised if you're the only non-Korean there.  I can't wait to go back.  I must go back."}
{"text":"Pros  -service is friendly -(some) dishes are really tasty; namely the spicy tofu soup with seafood and the seafood pancake appetizer -hits the spot when you are craving korean bbq  Cons  -not as many side dishes as at other korean restaurants (where's the seaweed??) -food takes a loooong time to come out (45+ min) -my bulgogi was sweeter than I wanted it to be, and not as spicy as I wanted it to be -they forgot to make my entree so it came out 10 min later than everyone else's"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Korean restaurant. Their food is always consistent and delicious. All workers are Korean and seems like 90% of patrons are Korean as well. That tells you that it's authentic.  Most dishes are amazing. I dare you to try the blood sausage soup or Chung gook jang, fermented soy bean stew (the one that smells like dirty feet, lol). I have! It's all delicious.  My current favorite is the yook gae-jang and the octopus stone pot. Don't forget to try the appetizers, seafood pancake or the kimchi pancake. Both very good.  I love this location. There's Korean grocery store next door and Chinese BBQ place across the parking lot to get some roast duck for later."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Korean restaurant in the Tempe area. Found this place through Yelp so I decided to give it a shot. Ordered the bulgogi and was a little disappointed. The flavor was a little bland, normally the bulgogi flavor should really stand out but not this. The appetizer had less selection than other places that I have been to but the problem was that the flavor was also a little bland.   The pros about this place is the service and the portions. I think they may specialize in the tofu soup. Seemed like a lot of people ordered that when I was there."}
{"text":"Hodori is one of my favorite Korean BBQ restaurants on this side of town.  I love everything from their spicy tofu soup to the kimchi pancake!  I've had most of the menu throughout the years and must say that their entrees are so delicious.  Their stone rice bowls are amazing.  The portion sizes here are pretty big so it's always idea to share.  The staff is always super friendly, the place is always clean, and you'll never walk away hungry."}
{"text":"Man, I don't know whether I dislike this restaurant or dislike Korean food.  I think I might not like Korean food so I won't fault Hodori for it.  I was brought here by some Korean friends who dig the joint, so the food must be okay, but I just wasn't into it.  Service was friendly, however, and everyone else liked the food, so it'll earn and \"A-OK but won't be voluntarily coming back\" from me.  We had the bulgogi hot pot and something called bossam.  I really wasn't a fan of the meat.  I think it must be an acquired taste.  There was some sort of sweet and syrupy potato side-dish, though, that was delicious.  All in all, this is a fun place to go to try a novel new ethnic food.  I'm just an ignorant American who likes cheeseburgers better than Korean food, so don't mind me."}
{"text":"the only thing i ever order here are the balgogi and seafood tofu soup so i don't know how reliable my review is going to be. i need to talk about the balgogi though. i went here last month and ordered the balgogi and i felt like i ordered a dish of seasoned fat with brown food coloring. i didn't enjoy it at all, but i thought maybe they ran out of the good meat, or the chef just suck that day. well, that's obviously not the case because i went back a couple days ago and ordered the balgogi again and this time it was worst than the last. i understand the economy is down, but gezz with the prices they charge shouldn't they be able to afford to offer a decent quality of meat?  the service here isn't that great either. it has never been great, but it didn't bother me because this is a busy restaurant. i always thought that they should hire more people but that's their business.   i'm giving this place 3 stars for what it used to be."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in Arizona. I've tried their kimchi tofu soup with pork, spicy pork bbq, soon dae soup, and dol pan bibimbap. The side dishes are top notch in taste and variety and Hodori's tofu soup is comparable to my favorites in Atlanta, the city of many Koreans. The service is a bit slow and inefficient and the side dishes come out a bit later than at other restaurants, but the taste makes up for the logistical flaws. Don't forget to ask for the barley tea (it's free)!"}
{"text":"Stayed for two hours during lunch and the service was good.  It was very crowded when I went it which shows it is popular.  My friend and I had Bugolgi, The Brisket And Green Onion Noodle Soup, and Tofu soup w mushroom. All of them were delicious! My ultimate favorite dish is the Bugolgi!"}
{"text":"I love Korean food and so I was happy to see that there was a restaurant here in the valley. Hodori is my guilty pleasure. I have never once gone there and had anything less than an amazing experience. The food is delicious, the wait staff is polite, and I am a hooked customer!"}
{"text":"The bulgogi was terribly fatty, however the portions were bigger.  I rather have quality over quantity, so I wasn't a fan.  The kalbi was more pleasing and the flavor was okay.  The banchan were fairly standard, nothing mind blowing.  The best gauge is usually the kimchi and taste if their homemade recipe is as superior as other restaurants.    With two soon dobu one spicy and the other mild, the soup came out white.  When asked about the mild spice, the chef says the spice is there.  I couldn't taste or smell a hint of spiciness in that soup.  If you have white, mild, spicy and extra spicy, I would imagine the mild has some type of spice and color to the soup base.      Overall, it wasn't terrible, but given the neighborhood, maybe it's as good as it gets here.  I'm just a visitor passing through and giving my opinion of our visit here."}
{"text":"Food is really great but be prepared to pay $$. A dish can cost 10$ and up and if you are like me who likes to try two or more dishes (i.e. I always order soup) then expect to pay a lot. It is good for groups and the quality of food is great. The only thing is that you have to flag down servers if you want more water or refills on your sides. Otherwise, it is a good place to eat if you are not on a budget and really craving korean food.  *** They have lunch specials so if you are on a budget go at lunch. Overall, I'd recommend this place since I like the quality of their food and I am willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"Hodori is probably the better Korean restaurants in the valley. Since its summer time, I got mool neng myun, which is a buckwheat noodle dish in an icy broth. Their broth was good but I feel like they're being cheap with the rest of the toppings that should be in the dish. Normally when you order this dish at other Korean restaurants, they give you a couple slices of beef brisket and a whole boiled egg along with the usual pickled radish and cucumber shreds. Hodori's neng myun does not come with any meat and they only give you half of a boiled egg for the same price....  My mom got the bibim neng myun which is a spicy noodle dish with no broth and it was ok, spicy and sweet. Service is usually slow, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to bring us water. At the end of the meal when they give you your check, they usually bring out a yogurt drink for everyone at the table but I noticed some tables would get the drinks and others wouldn't. I'm no sure if the servers just forgot or what but they should work on being more consistent with that."}
{"text":"This is a very good Korean place to eat.  It is just a little on the pricey side if you get a drink or two and also eat a full meal."}
{"text":"All of the food I have had here is tasty coming from a person who has never had Korean food before. I really like their tofu hot pots, they come with big servings a big ol cauldron bowl.   The two times I have been here I went in the afternoon at like 2 or 3 I think and the service was slow and unattentive, they didn't take our drink order (though they did bring water) and didn't come back with the bill for a long time.   I imagine like EVERY resteraunt the service is better during peak hours or at least when you aren't the only customer, but it would have been nice to get a little more attention.  The place is decently large and the dining area is very clean."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork bulgogi and beef bulgogi soup.  Both were good and both came out hotter than hades.  Sides were ok.  Restaurant was relatively busy but food came out reasonably fast for the number of people there.  Overall a little happier with the Korean food here than at other locations in the Chandler/Mesa area."}
{"text":"The food was just delicious! The bibim bap was just perfect on the hot stone bowl. I would definitely come back if I ever pass through Arizona."}
{"text":"Kalbi Short Ribs Dinner was a generous amount of food. I ate here many years ago and it never stood out before.  The dinners were all generous and yummy but a little pricey.  A no frills restaurant but the food is pretty darn good.  I would recommend this restaurant and come in hungry because you are going to get served a mound of food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very spacious, great service and they have the best kim chi fried rice and Korean BBQ Beef. It is located at a mini Korean plaza next to a supermarket. Plenty of parking and the service is great."}
{"text":"Went here recently with the tour around-the-world lunch group that I organize.   This was a great lunch.  I appreciate a restaurant that understands that a group can grow.   Our group doubled in size from the start and our servers were more than accommodating.  I ordered 2 things at this restaurant for lunch.  I ordered the Haemul Pajeon (Seafood pancake) to start.  I ate a small piece of it and had it packaged to bring home for lunch/dinner the next day.  A very tasty pancake with lots of shrimp and squid in it, onions and other spices.  Similar to an okonomyaki that we frequently see in Japanese restaurants.  For my main portion of the meal, I had a bowl of the Kimchi chigae  (Kimchi soup)  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=piisc06BvMh6csRPY7RvHw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA.  The yelpers that said this was a delicious dish were  not mistaken.  A very well seasoned and delicious bowl of soup that had nice chucks of pork in it and the veggies.  Fellow Yelper and ATW lunch groupie, Dawn K, said she really enjoyed the somewhat fatty meat in the soup.  I personally enjoyed the spiciness!  I would eat this again and I can't wait to have it again.  I wasn't very impressed with their banchan selection.  The side dishes just were not as tasty as I would have liked."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times...busy or not busy, service is ALWAYS slow. Tables are available but no one seems to want to clean them. Dirty tables are always present when I come, yeah very appealing. A larger party came after us and got seated first. Rude. Food is ok. Probably the last time I'm coming here."}
