{"text":"I don't often write reviews but this deserves a note.  My wife and I have eaten at the Blochi several times eating in one time. It was really good that time and my wife really loved their plain rice as it had a nice subtle flavour. Another time we got the Tandoori chicken Shawarmas.  They were good with nice tandoori chunks of chicken. This time we got again and it was hard to find the thin slices of flavourless chicken.  The shawarma was about half the size of the last time, mostly just the Naan wrap.  The rice was just salty, very salty. I will not be returning to this place. Too bad, they had started well."}
{"text":"This place has a great tandoori chicken Shawarma and butter chicken!

The place is clean and the people is very nicely decorated, they have some more western items but plenty of the traditional items I prefer. Best Pakistani I have had in Calgary."}
{"text":"We ordered take out: a daal and a lamb curry with naan and samosas as appetizers. It was ready in 10 minutes. I think they offer delivery as well but we picked it up ourselves. 

The portion sizes were more on the small side, except for the naan, that one is huge. But the prices are small too, so it works out. The taste is really good! Bot dishes were quite spicy but not too much. If you don't like eating spicy food let them know so they can prepare it with less heat to it. The samosas were good, I personally wasn't too keen on the sauce though, but they taste good without it as well. 

They can probably seat about 20 people and although the location is quite \"simple\" they did a good job with the d√©cor. Not sure how long this restaurant can survive in this location with the economy still being low, I hope they can make it, I like having this kind of food close by. Parking is available outside and if you have someone in your group who doesn't like this kind of food, there is a Spaghetti Cafe right next door :)"}
{"text":"Just polished off a dinner for two with my better half and we are both SA-TIS-FIED! The service was helpful and gave recommendations. This place was a saviour post-hike as I made my way back to Calgary from Canmore. Nothing like some spicy curry and naan after a gruelling hike in the mountains, to make you feel nourished. With reasonable pricing and deliciousness like this, I will be back."}
{"text":"We tried Chana and nihari and both were very tasty, naans however were a little too crisp and stiff to eat but once we mentioned to them they brought more fresh naans for us that were much better... Chai was one of the best served..."}
{"text":"We tried to get delivery from Blochi four times and were successful only once. The one time was quite good and we'd definitely order from this place again. Unfortunately, three out of four times we were told \"sorry, our delivery guy didn't show up today.\" Unfortunately, an unreliable delivery service to the restaurant equates to an unreliable restaurant for us."}
{"text":"Been to BLOCHI a couple times now, and really enjoyed the food, full of flavors. the decor is very nice, and service was good. Tried a few items on the menu, don't have any favorites as they all were good, the butter chicken and chicken tikka especially. Do try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Totally authentic Pakistani food at its finest! The former restaurant at this location used to be an Indian takeout and there is no comparison. The food at Blochi is divine, loved their cuisine and the quality of food. The portions are good, the prices are great. They offer combos designed for 2,4,6 and even 8-10. Makes ordering easy! The flame grilled kabobs and Tikkas are full of Flavors. I tried a huge variety of the menu and was very pleased. The Biriyani was delicious and the curries are tasty, with the garlic Nann. Overall great value and delicious food. I highly recommend BLOCHI to anyone with a passion for exotic spices, and Flavors!"}
{"text":"I'd go here again. Probably not a weekly or even a monthly spot, but I'd go back spontaneously with another friend and try some more items on the menu. The naan bread here exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Blochi is located right on the Trans Canada highway North West of Calgary. It is small but has neat and chic set up. I reached towards the day end and was about to return when I was let in by the owner, still some 40 minutes to go so I was in luck.
I ordered chicken biryani and chicken tikka and a cup of masala chai. 
The tikka was grilled well grilled and chicken done nicely. Biryani had really good flavor and aroma to it,however when it comes to biryani most places don't do justice and this was no exception but good taste though. Would like to come back to try the kebabs though."}
{"text":"We have been going to Blochi for a long time now and seriously disappointment with management and the quality of food.....first - though advertised on the door's menu, they would not honour the 15% discount over $40.00. I asked to speak to the manager and was told no one was around. Secondly, the take out portions of their butter chicken and goat were 1/2 the sizes they used to be. Third, the butter chicken had 6 nugget sized pieces of chicken and the rest was sauce and the goat was disturbingly dry. I am so sad to see this establishment treat their customers this way. We will have to find another go-to place Indian/Pakistanian in the NW."}
