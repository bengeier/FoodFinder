{"text":"This place has one of the best chicken shawarma a I have eaten. I love that they offer leg of lamb as we'll. great verity in what to order and also very healthily."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. I had the gyro. My husband had the falafel. The gyro was okay. Very strange to have green olives on a gyro but all in all it didn't taste bad.  Husband's falafel was quite green on the inside, not fried well and generally greasy and flavorless.  The fries were okay. Obviously frozen. There was a really strange sauce. It was far too thick to be tatziki. Sort of like sour cream with cucumbers in it.  Our waitress was very nice and quite helpful.   It was also totally empty when we were there.    Not sure we will go back.  So much potential but it just wasn't that great"}
{"text":"Very clean and very pleasant service. Food portions are generous!  Fresh food and well seasoned!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what kind of food this restaurant offers. I looked on facebook.. nothing. I looked for a website online.. nothing. It would be great to see some photos of the food, as I am sure I am not alone in wondering what this restaurant is all about. If they don't identify who they are , I think they will fail before they get started.. and I hope that doesn't happen."}
{"text":"I really have not had this bad of an experience at a restaurant in a very long time.  The wait staff and even the chef seem to be clueless about the menu.  The waiter we had seemed very confused...  THEY CHARGE .35 for TAP WATER (not to go...in THEIR CUPS!!!!)  They don't have Greek or Mediterranean dressings for salads....OR TZATZIKI SAUCE!!!  My friend ordered it and they gave her a strange peanut sauce.  Um do they know they serve gyros???  Weird.  I got a Greek salad and had to add more chicken because of the small amount.  Out of the 4 of us, the only decent thing was pita/hummus.  Again, they charge .35 for tap water!!!!!!  Don't go!!!!"}
{"text":"Clean.  Friendly.  The waiter tried hard to please us.  Heard a customer complain about the sauce.  \"It's mayonnaise\".  Gyros were great.  Fries avg.  I would eat there again.  Place only 2 months old.  Has potential."}
{"text":"Downtown Concord has the potential to be so much more with colorful, privately owned restaurants, serving homemade recipes with fresh ingredients, full of robust flavor and portions. This is not that place.  There's nothing impressive about Atlas Kabob House. The interior is colorless and uninviting. Dining tables and chairs feel light and cheap. Things seem out of place. I tried the falafel wrap, as I thought it would be indicative of the overall menu. It was dry and lacked flavor. The pita tasted store-bought and was similar to chewing leftover cardboard. Overall my entire meal was flavorless and drab. I've heard this from several of my neighbors as well, regarding many of their other dishes, so it seems to be a trend.   The waitress referred to tzatziki sauce as \"dat white sauce?\"  I went home and had a slice of pizza, just to have some flavor.  I give it 6 months."}
