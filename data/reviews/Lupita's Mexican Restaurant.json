{"text":"This place was TERRIBLE. Of all the Mexican restaurants in El Mirage / Surprise, this is easily the worst. I got the carne asada, and it tasted like they took a flank steak straight from the freezer to the grill with no stopping for seasoning or tenderizing. Chips were cold and unsalted, the salsa tasted like watered down ketchup, the Rice and Beans were inedible, and the Ice Tea tasted like it had sat all day to sour. PLEASE PLEASE, go to Las Fuentes, Rio Mirage, or even the drive through Humberto's next to City Hall before you go here.

I'm a 5th generation native Arizonan, and I don't think I've ever had worse Mexican food in my life."}
{"text":"I've been eating Lupe's food for years, first at La Fondita, then here at Lupita's.  It's fantastic; the daily specials are always a good value, and I've had about everything on the menu at some point and I've never been disappointed by any of the selections.  The green chili is probably my favorite.  The chips and salsa are always fresh and delicious.  Usually I get takeout for lunch so can't attest to the margarita quality but I've heard good things.  The decor is a little wild, but I don't come here to look at the art, I come here for the great food."}
{"text":"Awful! The staff was friendly, but I am pretty sure the waiter was on drugs. I am disappointed that the food was so terrible. Even the ice tea was awful, how do you screw up ice tea! The only half way decent thing were the chips. Will never go here again and will tell people do NOT go!"}
{"text":"I found the people here very friendly and helpful.  I came in for take out and found the menu very well laid-out so I could make my choices quickly.  My order of two plates and a kids plate were ready in 15 minutes.  Now, my favorite Mexican food is TexMex due to being raised in south Texas and really enjoy that flavor.  This food is not TexMex but has a good flavor.  The refried beans and rice were excellent, as good as any I've ever had.  My daughter's taco had a generous helping of shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, etc.  My wife's burro (burrito) also had a generous amount of shredded beef, served without a sauce poured over it.  My plate had a tamale with the same shredded beef and had a cheese enchilada with a sauce.  It's probably the \"Arizonan/Sonoran\" style but we all thought the beef didn't have seasoning.  My wife and I thought it was delicious, but tasted like moist roast beef that was shredded without seasonings appropriate for a taco, burrito, or tamale.  The tamale was delicious with excellent seasoning in the masa.  My only concern was the masa was very thick (about 3/4 to 1 inch) around a normal amount of beef for a tamale.  Maybe this is the Sonoran style?  Overall, all the food tasted good.  We'll need to try more from their menu to see how everything else tastes."}
{"text":"Lupitas is by far one of the best mexican restaurants out in El Mirage!! The service is always fast never a long wait and the staff is super friendly. Very clean and well taken care of. My favorite thing on the menu is the MENUDO!! im there every Sunday for FOOTBALL and the MENUDO!!! Ive been coming here for years and so has my family def worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"This place was just O.K.  I have been in AZ for almost 2 years now, and I can honestly say that it is my least favorite Mexican restaurant thus far.  

Pros: 
-The waitress was awesome. She was both waiting tables AND cooking--now that's skill right there. 
-The chips were amazing. The salsa was alright, but it kind of had a pizza flavor because of the oregano. 
-The rice and beans were delicious! 

Cons: 
-They upcharge for EVERYTHING. Want to share? That's an extra $1.50. Also, they charge $1 extra for chicken--yes, chicken, one of the cheapest meats out there. Oh, and it's an extra dollar for pork and/or carne asada. I understand the carne asada part, but pork and chicken? Not so much
-Speaking of chicken, mine was terrible. I got a chicken burrito, and it was just plain, boiled chicken inside a flour tortilla--nothing else. It was seriously just boiled in plain water. There were no spices, no nothing, just plopped a chicken breast in water. Tasteless. My husband's machaca was pretty good though. It tasted like plain roast beef, but it was MUCH better than the gross chicken. 

With all that said, I probably won't be going here again. It was way too expensive for food that was mediocre at best. I much prefer Humberto's down the road. It's cheaper and the food is much tastier."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are the bomb... Food is a little over priced but it's worth it..Food is great..small place not much room for big families. But we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The shredded beef tacos and chips and salsa are Devine!!!!!!  The people are friendly and will make anything to order"}
{"text":"Large portions for low prices.  I absolutely love the shredded beef tamales and chicken enchiladas.  The food is always consistent.  I know what I'm getting when I order it.  This is a great place to meet friends for a casual meal.  It's quiet and has room for larger groups.  I usually order my food for pick-up.  It's always ready on-time, hot, fresh, and delicious!  The restaurant's staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I am so very disappointed that I did not get up and leave. The service is slow and terrible. The food was probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. I mean seriously, how can yo¨mess up a quesadilla? the chicken  was way to salty and dry. it was a flour tortilla with some yellow cheese on top, then added shredded chicken. The biggest surprise was he place was packed! Maybe it's just me, but I expect food to be tasty, hot and  not take forever to get. Then the bill came....what a rip off!"}
{"text":"Very authentic menu, it's refreshing since most Mexican restaurants nowadays are so Americanized.  One of few places you can get really good tripa tacos and its a friendly environment. I can't complain for being a mom and pop restaurant it's clean and appealing."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican! The salsa is amazing. Great service timely and polite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was ok at best.  Decent but definitely not the best Mexican.  The salsa tasted like it was made with enchilada sauce.   The chips were fresh and hot, which was a plus."}
{"text":"Ok where to start. Thought we would give it a shot and we probably won't return. The staff was good but the food was about average. Not a lot of spice if any in the beef and they charge extra for green sauce. The 99 cent margaritas and little if any alcohol but I guess what do you expect for 99 cents? All in all very average and a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Lupitas moved to this new location and it is A LOT smaller than the old place. Its in the same location as Castillo's was located before it closed. The difficult part about this location is that it is oddly designed. The restaurant is all booths, one right after another in two rows. There are no tables...just booths. And if you need a high chair, it makes it difficult to get around them because of the layout of the room. 

The decor is more subtle than the previous location. There are a few pictures up on the wall and the painted mural from Castillo's tenure is still on the wall. Because of the layout of the room, the decor is low-key and very understated.

The food is good although nothing terribly special. The chips are fresh and hot. The salsa is chunky and flavorful. I wish they had seafood on the menu. All they offer are beef and chicken items so that kind of limits the selections. Mexican food is all pretty similar in its ingredients--all contain meat, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and have some sort of vessel containing it all. There is nothing unique to Lupitas that you can't get at any other Mexican restaurant. But it's good tasting food, served hot, with a friendly staff at a good price. It's worth a visit."}
{"text":"The basic rule of thumb for us gringos when it comes to getting authentic, delicious, cheap Mexican food is to go to Mexican restaurants that actually have Mexicans eating in them. Lupita's is one such restaurant.

Make no mistake, Lupita's is a dive. A complete and total dive. And what can you expect for a restaurant based in El Mirage? It's not exactly the gastronomic capital of the world and Lupita's doesn't disappoint.  The furniture is mismatched and the sombreros that are hanging on the wall are definitely cheesy.  Even the Christmas lights that are hung up are hap-hazard at best.  However, there are no better Carne Asadas, Green Chili Burros, or dare I suggest it...the Gringo's delight....tacos...in the Valley! 

A kids' menu is available with the usual kid-type fair and the adult menu has a broad spectrum of delicious offerings sure to please the most discernable palate. 

On Friday nights, there is a live Mariachi band from 6:30-9:30PM and Mondays-Thursdays, margaritas are only $1.99 from 3-7PM. And those margaritas are quite yummy!

The service staff is friendly, relaxed, and treat everyone like regulars and there are A LOT of regulars. Guests can sit wherever they like and there is always a game of some sort on the televisions. And dependings on the evening, you can find Lupe herself cooking in the kitchen. 

Take out service is available and they are more than capable of handling orders large and small in short order.

Oh, did I mention the fresh, housemade salsa? Yeah...that's a definite must have as well. The chips are fresh and hot...not hot from under a heat lamp, hot from being just take out of the fryer. 

Again, make no mistake, this place is a total dive, but you will not regret for a second going to Lupitas' for your dose of Mexican food delights."}
{"text":"Muy bueno!   A very sparse but friendly place, located behind the strip mall offering down home Sonoran delights.  The machaca was outstanding, with great beans, and suitable rice.  The tortillas were awesome, really fresh and tasty, best I've had outside of Carolina's.  Worthy selection of 'Mexican beers.

Check it out amigo."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big Mexican food fan, but I loved this place. Clean, no wait, and great food. My wife and I will be regulars."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  The staff is friendly and the food is fresh.  The salsa has great flavor.  The chicken used in many if the dishes has great flavor and is not bland, unlike a lot of Mexican restaurants I've been to.  Try the chicken chimichanga.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican! Chips and salsa are the best. Enchiladas and tacos were amazing! Prices were very reasonable. Next time we have an appetite for real Mexican this is where we will go! Thanks"}
{"text":"now that lupitas has moved to just south of tbird on dysart, the place does look better.  but if you want the very best mexican food in the valley, this is the place to go!  the chips are the best i have ever had and the salsa is so fresh!  not spicey  and hot so  all you taste is \"hot\", just delicious!  when  they closed the one in the mall, me and the girl's from work literally tracked them down at their house to find out what was going on.  they told us about the new place, just south of thunderbird off dysart.  we were sooo relieved to know our favorite mexican restaurant was not closed for good.  love this place!  the waiters, usually henry, are very nice and everybody makes you feel at home.    i always have the same thing, shredded beef burito, deep fried(i know thats terrible) sooo good!  the beef is so juicy and tender.  of course the tortillas are so fresh. sometimes change it up and have a chicken taco and cheese enchilada.  yummy!  i have given it 5 stars because of the food, service, and because they deserve it!"}
{"text":"We've had food from here a few times in the past and it was always decent, pretty good.  But we had it again yesterday and it had been awhile since we had gotten take out from there.  It was delicious!  I mean, it's always been good but we could literally tell the difference in taste yesterday, it was so good!  It was hot, fresh, good portions, I don't know what changed or what happened but it was twice as good as what it had been in the past.  Only con I have is I ordered 3 flautas but was missing 1 :( We'll for sure be back, it was on point this time!"}
{"text":"The Galindo family has owned and operated restaurants in El Mirage for over forty years, and it shows. The food is flavorful, the service prompt and pleasurable, and the patrons are loyal. 
As a 5th generation native Arizonan and a life-long patron of Galindo's establishments (my first solid food as a child was beans from La Fondita), I can't recommend this restaurant enough. Nothing flashy on the menu, but what's there is executed well, and with due care."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Horrible food. Overprices. Would never go back here again."}
{"text":"I come here as often as I can! They have awesome food but my favorite hands down is the menudo. It's fresh made and not full of grease like many other valley places. The wait staff have always been nice, quick and fun to talk to and the owner is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"My family and I come here ever so often.  The waitress/cash register gal always remembers us and we always remember her.  She is a sweetie.  The place is small and hidden away which is a main reason why we come here...you can always get in without long lines and annoying crowds.  For the most part the food is decent, though we have encountered some meals that were subpar as mentioned in other reviews.  By far and away the food has been mostly good and satisfying.  Its perfect for those nights when you just don't want to cook at home, but don't want to contend with noisy crowded restaurants either.  Eat, enjoy, and get back home."}
{"text":"How did I end up here???


This looks like Tijauana threw up all over the place in here. That being said ..

CHow Chow- I had the Fry bread taco style it was good. Nothing too special but I did clean my plate. The bread was soft and warm and you can tell it was very fresh , however the cheese and other items seem like they came out of a bag that had been frozen. 

Looks galore- the decor is just madness , hodge podge of all things mexico. But the building is very stange too its part of a indoor mall that looks like worlds smallest swap mart and it was kinda creepy because everything was closed. and you park in the scary ally in the back and creep through the back door, i felt like I needed some password.

Why I would go back- The super smiley happy as anything, waitress greeting up super quick and was super nice. Food came out as we ate the owner greeted up and just felt so welcomed!

Let me wrap this up- It just like any semi generic mexican restaurant , so dont go out of your way to get here. But I bet it is always consistent with the food on your plate."}
{"text":"The Chile Rellenos are amazing here.  Not a fan of the red enchilada sauce.  Their green enchilada sauce is the best I've ever had!   Chips and Salsa are always hot and fresh.  Service is definitely better in the evenings than during the day."}
{"text":"I had a good lunch there.  The location is rather unassuming, and hard to find in a strip mall in the northeast corner of Dysart and Thunderbird/Waddell in El Mirage, Arizona.  Atmosphere is subdued, cafe booths and a few tables.  Nothing fancy, but the food was good.  I had the chips and salsa while waiting on my lunch, wow, very good.  It was \"Taco Tuesday\", so I had the chicken tacos which were super fresh and not greasy at all.  Beans and rice accompanied my tacos and while they didn't stand out, there were great supporting actors on the food theater of my plate.  The owner/Mr. Lupita/waiter was very friendly and seemed really helpful and eager to please.  As I was paying my check I did see Lupita in the kitchen at the grill cooking.  I think the price was fair for the quality and quantity I received.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been searching for quality Mexican food in the surprise area for a while and so we tried lupita's and was so pleased.  Great service, great food, great price for true Mexican food. Not Mexican American you get at most places."}
{"text":"Best local Mexican food in the north west valley  service is good food is good and it's a local mom and pop restaurant the salsa is good and the hot is really good"}
{"text":"Bit of a hidden gem for great Mexican food. My wife wanted to try it and the food was so good I was surprised they didn't have a line out the door. Do yourself a favor and stop by."}
{"text":"I miss the old location. So dark and mysterious. The air divine. The decor spoke Sonora. It was the most authentic Arizona.
The new place is new. The food is as awesome as ever."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots for our lunch hour! Me and my Co-workers can always count a delicious meal here at Lupita's! The staff is so friendly and keep us coming back! Definitely a great spot to satisfy your appetite!"}
{"text":"The food is always good! I've never had to wait for a table. Whenever I have extra money to eat out, we treat ourselves here."}
{"text":"The food has stayed consistently excellent.  Came in to have a holiday meal with my daughter and was greatly satisfied."}
{"text":"I love the food and ambiance, but don't order a beer for happy hour even if the sign says domestic/imports $2:50 on a bud light sign. It's only mexican beer no matter what is advertised. I thought Bud and Bud light were domestic? Go figure"}
