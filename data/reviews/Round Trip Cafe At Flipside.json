{"text":"Who would have thought!! The food is super yummy at this Game Center! Gourmet style sandwiches, burgers and pizza to die for. Not to mention parents are able to dine in the cafe while the children are off bowling, laser tagging or gaming! Great place, even if you just go for the food!"}
{"text":"the staff were not very friendly, and seemed kinda like they either lack social skills or were just plain avoiding their jobs. the food was okay for a bowling alley but not as good as a real restaurant.  eat at a real restaurant,  THEN come to flipside."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here if you have hungry kiddos or anyone that is \"hangry\" in your party. It took almost an hour to get our food and our appetizer came out last. They said they only had one cook in the back and usually I would give them the benefit of the doubt, but this has happened to us multiple times. The worst part about it is they didn't even warn the line of people that kept coming with hungry kids to tell them it was going to be a while. The lady sitting next to us ordered 1 appetizer for her restless kiddo and still didn't have her food by the time we left. They do have good food but not worth the wait!"}
