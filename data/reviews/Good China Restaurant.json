{"text":"Thank you fellow yelper's for this recommendation! Probably the best chinese food in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Like most Chinese joints, this place is the cheapest during lunch.  I appreciate a good lunch special and I know that those specials aren't the authentic Chinese cuisine dishes of the Far East, rather the Americanized versions that we have all come to know and love.  They do it all right here and I am always pleased with the service and quality here.

Craving chow mein, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour, and fried rice?  This is your place."}
{"text":"The staff here is also so nice and friendly. We go just often enough that they recognize us (maybe once a month). The interior is clean and the food is good, solid chinese food. Their sweet and sour is excellent and their lunch specials are something to consider. Well priced and plentiful. You will NOT leave here hungry! Be warned: if you are going on a Sunday, the parking can be challenging due to the church in the same complex."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 were all new to Good China.  This restaurant was clean with very nice decor and friendly and attentive staff.  Our food was mostly Ok with the exception of the Gung Pau Chicken whose sauce was not good.   We all ordered before dinner cocktails which were very very weak."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing is an understatement! Good China boasts on their website that they were the 2007 recipients of New York's Top 100 Chinese/Asian Fusion Award, and all I can say is that may have been so in 2007. However, Good China fails to live up to that reputation, today, 7-years later. My family has recently moved back to the United States from living in Singapore for the last 4-years, and we are originally from New York. So, we have a little knowledge in authentic Chinese food and Americanized New York Chinese food--and this eating experience really fell short.

Starting with the appetizers, we had \"Spring Rolls\", and for those of you New Yorkers, most restaurants have flavorful \"Egg Rolls\" that are stuffed with a combination of pork, shrimp, cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, and Asian flavors. What we received were oil saturated \"Spring Rolls\". Because they were so oily, each bite oozed grease, canceling out any flavors from the vegetables and spices used. We could have literally squeezed out enough oil to reuse. We also ordered the \"Crab Puffs\", which many Chinese restaurants, including many in Singapore call \"Crab Rangoon\"--a type of dim sum. There was very little filling used inside the wrappers, and it seemed that someone might have been heavy handed with sugar, because they were incredibly sweet instead of savory. You could not even taste any crab (and they may have used imitation crab from the looks of it), nor could you taste the cream cheese since it had been turned into a dessert cream due to the over use of something sweet as a flavoring.

What can I say about the \"War Wonton Soup\"? The proper name for this soup is \"Wor Wonton Soup\", but what we had was \"Slime Soup\". The wontons had been so over cooked that they melted off the filling, producing an off-putting slimy texture. However, the broth was okay--a bit on the salty side.

Next, the main dishes we tried. We ordered \"House Lo Mein\". Obviously, they use Fettuccini Pasta instead of authentic Chinese Egg Noodles, this too was on the salty side and the meat was over cooked--not at all tender. We also had \"Pork Egg Foo Young\" (Egg Foo Yong), which were flat and cake-like in texture--nothing like Egg Foo Young. Egg Foo Young is, simply put, an egg omelet. Well, that is what it is in Chinese restaurants in New York and Singapore. How can you mess up an egg omelet? Oh, you can make it the consistency of cake! The sauce they use on top of it seems to be the same brown salty sauce used on other dishes we had like the \"Garlic Shrimp\". \"Garlic Shrimp\", in every place we have ever eaten it, is usually a light garlicky sauce--not a brown salty sauce with no hint of garlic taste.

The \"Sesame Chicken\", we are still not sure if there was actually chicken inside the heavily battered nuggets--the chicken was hard and over cooked. It also tasted like someone had poured a whole bottle of honey over the nuggets--no sesame seeds in sight. In addition, if it could not get worse, when you looked in the container of this supposed \"Sesame Chicken\", it seems they spooned in all the burnt residual batter crust that sits within the oil used for frying--meaning they are not periodically cleaning and changing the oil between orders--gross!

On the plus side, the \"House Fried Rice\" was descent, portion size was good, and the establishment looked clean. Overall, even though the prices are average, you are overpaying for poor quality food."}
{"text":"This place sounded promising from the yelp reviews.  So we gave it a shot.  We ordered take out and it was ready in 15 minutes.  

We ordered:
House Lo Mein
General Tso's Chicken
Egg Rolls
Crab Puffs

Everything was just ok.  The flavors were good but nothing made me want to come back.  The General Tso's chicken was pretty spicy and a good flavor but a little bland.  I was left wanting more flavor.   The house LoMein was good as well but a little bland.  The meat was cooked well and tasted good.  The Egg Rolls had good flavor but were a little soggy on the inside.  Crab Puffs were ok as well.  Everything was just 'ok'.  

I wouldn't go back here.  I would choose Wong's Jr over this place.  Good China is just that--Good, not Great.  If you're in this area and you're looking for chinese, go to Wong's Jr."}
{"text":"Worst service, worst food and worst customer service I have ever had. First my drink order was delivered wrong. Next my appetizer of BBQ ribs was so over cooked it was like eating leather from the gloves that OJ used to kill his wife. My wife ordered Kum Pow Scallops and specifically requested that it NOT be spicy. It came to her as spicy as if she hadn't said a word. I made the mistake of ordered the sizzling seafood platter. That dish came out so over done that I could not remove the lobster meat from the shell without it coming out in shreds. It stuck to the shell like they crazy glued it in. When I complained I was told that I shouldn't have ordered that, I should have ordered something else. I was flabbergasted by the waitresses statement. I informed her that information would have been much more useful before I ordered that mess. I informed the waitress that I was not interested in eating anymore and requested that it be removed from the table. I assumed that dish would be removed from my bill since I ate about 2 fork full of it...I assumed wrong. When the bill came, there was the sizzling seafood platter still listed at almost $16.00. I complained and asked to speak with the manager. The manager came over to informed me it was their policy not to remove anything from the bill but to replace it with another item from their menu. Since both my wife's order, as well as my order was horrible, I decided to skip the possible food poisoning and to merely pay the bill as it was. I included a tip of ZERO which I clearly spelled out on their bill. 

This was without doubt the worst dinning experience I and my wife had ever had at a Chinese restaurant. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! 
The food, the service and everything about this place was terrible! I hope to God I do not get food poisoning from what I did ingest."}
{"text":"My wife and I hate really salty food, so we can't eat Chinese food very often. Good China is one of the few Chinese food restaurants that does not make their food to salty to enjoy while still having excellent flavor. We enjoy the Moo Goo Gai Pan."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best kept secret in all of Phoenix.  It is a family-run Chinese restaurant in a strip mall, so it is unpretentious.   And, the prices are very reasonable.  But, the food is exceptional.  Everything on the menu is something you can recommend to your friends.  It is the standard by which all Chinese restaurants are measured ... literally.  You will notice that I have given this restaurant five stars.  Any other Chinese restaurant that I review here will be measured against this one.  It's that Good!"}
{"text":"We really love Good China and my whole family has been going there for many years! First off, everyone who works there is always so friendly and we've always had great service. They have my favorite pork fried in the city and their orange chicken is yummy with a bit of a spicy kick to it so it stands out compared to other places. I also enjoy the crab puffs and I always ask for some of their sweet and sour sauce to bring home to use on chicken or other items later in the week."}
{"text":"I got four lunch specials and the egg flower drop soup. The first course was vegetables with chicken on rice, chicken and broccoli with fried rice, Beef and broccoli with fried rice, and Sesame chicken. I really enjoyed chicken with vegetables but wasn't happy about the Sesame chicken. The Sesame chicken had barely any sauce on it had one sesame on one chicken which tasted dry and flavorless due to not having the sauce or sesames on on it I guess. The soup was okay. All in all it was okay would of gave 4 stars if the sesame chicken was not just fried balls of chicken."}
{"text":"The crispy spicy orange chicken is my favorite. This place has a really nice atmosphere and they staff is super friendly.  Come here a few times a month and I'm slowly trying everything on the menu.  This is one of the best Chinese restaurants this side of the valley. The pieces are pretty good too. Their server Shawn was excellent."}
{"text":"We got take out from there the other night and we went on a recommendation by a family member with very good taste and a food fanatic who gives us all the local spots since we just moved here. Someone must have pissed off the chef that night because we couldn't finish the food. We got beef  teriyaki on sticks and they tasted strange and weird texture. We got combo plates and the fried rice was rice with soy sauce nothing else not even a vegetable. The pork egg foo yung didn't have the pork in it? It was in the sauce which was soooo salty it was rediculous. Egg rolls were soaked in grease not crispy and I enjoy my fair share of grease but I couldn't eat it. Crab Rangoon was like Exxon valdeez same story with chicken in the sweet and sour chicken.....I'm goona try it again but were ordering differently and going to dine in maybe if I get ripped on Mai tais and zombies it will be glorious....I'm dissapointed that they were off their game maybe they were drinking Mai tais....I'm gonna give them a three because the prices were great I'll review after my next visit..."}
{"text":"I have been a patron to Good China for over 30 years, it used to be that good. I would tell anyone who asked,  where they could find food Chinese food and of course I recommended Good China.  About 6 months ago we ordered the Mu Shu pork and House fried rice. We were very disappointed in that the uniformity of the vegetables and meat were terrible. The meat, didn't really taste like pork and was cut in the size of hunks of roast.  Same with the meat in the house fried rice. A few ingredients missing out of both.  Not much of the egg was noticeable in either dish. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED,  however,  people have off days so we chalked it up to that.  Yestetday we ordered the same dishes after about 2 months and nothing changed. What happened?  Appealing to the masses? Meaning Mexican style fajita cooking. Or did you just quit caring? Certainly not staying true to the Chinese culture, who I know takes pride in the art of the food that is presented. Shame on you!  We won't be back and we will discourage those who are looking for  good Chinese cuisine,  maybe try May Garden on 51st ave & Indian School?"}
{"text":"I have to start off I am not a huge fan of Chinese food except the beef on a stick is a favorite of mine. I met a friend for lunch and just got a appetizer because i wasn't that hunger and of course I got the beef on a stick! I was really looking forward to it because i hadn't had any for awhile. It was a sad disappointment....it was chewy with a weird flavor. I got it down by dipping it in sweet and sour sauce! That was they only thing i had though.... the service was awesome I will say. They were fast and always there to help!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food. Customer service is always very nice. They make my children feel welcomed everytime we go in."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night. Was impressed by the modern look inside, however the waitress was not very attentive. I didn't even get her name. The busboy was more attentive to us and it wasn't even busy in our section at all. I ordered the sweet and sour dish that had chicken and shrimp,while others ordered dinner combos. Theirs came first and I was still waiting for my order. She comes back and asks what I ordered again.....  WOW really? So I wait for another 10 min and out comes my food. The portions here are a joke. It was mostly green peppers and pineapples. Barely any chicken. The sauce didn't have that satisfying tang it should have. Their portions are very odd..as if it's for a child. You really don't get what you pay for here. I could go to a buffet and get better quality food without the long wait."}
{"text":"So I've been searching for the perfect Chinese place, and I think I have found it. I ordered to go which I called and did, the girl who answered spoke perfect English really easy to understand and answered all of my questions before me actually ordering. I order chicken fried rice with no egg, it was hot and delicious best fried rice I've had. Staff was nice food was great!!"}
{"text":"Service is good but the food is really good.  If you are looking for something authentic and you want something different than the usual Panda Express and PeiWei this is the place to come.  The orange chicken its cooked different from any other place I've ever been and its really good.  I haven't tried a dish that I didn't like.  Order the dinner for two and you will be very pleased.  Fried rice soup its great too."}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant many times before I decided to Yelp it and then stop in for a quick meal. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. A friend and I ordered an entree each (I ordered Orange Chicken and he ordered Mongolian Beef), a House Fried Rice to share and a Sizzling Rice Soup. Those were recommended by other fellow Yelpers. It was A TON of food and very delicious. We packed it home and had food for the next day. Best of all... it was not expensive at all!! It's a family owned restaurant, the staff is very friendly and service was fast. You can tell it was freshly cooked too. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The food has never disappointed.  Always fresh and tasty. Sweet and Sour,  kung pao chicken are great."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday dinner and first took forever to place our drink order, then waited to place our food order.  When we finally got our food one person in our party got vegetable low main and when she was half way finished she found a roach in her food."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed. Read some decent reviews before deciding to dine here and was let down. Ordered General Tso chicken and Kung Pao chicken to go. Made a special request on the Tso for only broccoli as the vegtable. Arrived home and opened carton to find they had given me mixed veg. Okay I can work around that but the breading on the chicken was lumpy and wet, not crispy as expected. No spice,  flavor or even chili pods! Gave 3 stars cause husband said his was \"o.k\".  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this gem in Peoria!!! Everything I've ever had here has been pretty good. My favorite by far is the Singapore rice noodles. Everything always taste fresh and is great quality. Reasonably priced and great portions. Been about 6 times and will continue to come here. Never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Good China with my parents and also order take out when we visit them in Sun City West. Until today, we always had a good experience and good food However, today my  wife ordered take out, which consisted of Orange Chicken as my dish.  When she got home and I opened up the takeout box, instead of Orange Chicken I had pieces of fried breading or fried chicken skin but no chicken.  When I called the establishment and spoke to the manager I was told that they use shredded chicken for the Orange Chicken, that I did not know what Orange Chicken was, and that if I wanted pieces of Chicken I should have ordered another chicken dish.  This was despite me stating that I did not get any chicken, that I have been there before and ordered Orange Chicken and  got  pieces of chicken. I also stated that my prior experience was unlike what my take out dish consisted of.  No apologies or concerns from the manager. I asked if there would be any accommodation to me since I ordered and paid for a chicken dish but did not get any chicken.  The manager did not care and continued to explain that there is shredded chicken even though neither my wife nor I could find actual chicken pieces. I could not eat the dish and threw it out because it had no chicken. This is my first negative review.  If I could give a zero rating I would not just for the lack of chicken but the extremely poor customer service.  I have had other dishes there and they are good.  However, you are  forewarned if you order Orange Chicken -do not expect to get chicken in your dish. Due to the lack of customer service and lack of concern, I will not be back. Lesson learned. There are other Chinese restaurants that serve good food along with good customer service.
Good China-not so good."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing this place on \"Check Please\" WOW!  We had a horrible experience and I could not recommend this place. Terrible service, slow and inconsistent.  The food was mediocre. Comparable to Panda Express. We ordered crispy duck, it was dry and over cooked and served cold. After a few minutes the waiter came by and told us he was sorry but the duck was old.  GREAT! So after munching on dry duck we were told it was a mistake and it would take 20 mins for a fresh duck. DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK. There are better places to enjoy your night out :( I rate this place a total loss."}
{"text":"The food is descent, but the portions are huge and for a lower price compared to other former good china. The egg rolls are made from flour wraps instead of the traditional rice wraps. The eggs rolls are also larger in size causing the filling to sometimes be cold. The food in general is good and cheap. Great for a quick bite, when craving for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have lived here my entire life and I have been searching for descent Chinese closer to my area forever. I just moved to Avondale. I was sent here on a recommendation and reviews. I am not a fan. Sad to say Panda is better eek :( I ordered pork fried rice, orange chicken, chicken egg foo young and mongolian beef. The pork fried rice was ok. no veggies(which I found odd, but ok) and no egg(which I found very odd). The orange chicken was not good. I like salty food, but very salty and no orange or spice and the texture was odd, not good. The chicken egg foo young was ok. I've had nastier and I'd eat it again so I would say ok. The mongolian beef was also very salty and the texture was odd and it didn't taste like mongolian beef. The portions were a good size and the prices were fair, so if you have persnickety palate do not waste your time."}
{"text":"This is an update, we have been back numerous times including dining in. Still love this place for a great neighborhood joint with good portions at a reasonable price. The sesame chicken tonight was awesome, but next time I will ask them to add some veggies. We also had the lettuce wraps and bean curd dish. I could do those wraps for lunch often, they are on the appetizer menu. I like the crisp lettuce with warm filling. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"First impression. Not bad. It's a clean place. Staff is friendly. They were blasting some 80's music inside. Not my thing but hey... Lol. So I ordered the Kung Pao chicken. The girlfriend got the Sweet and Sour chicken. I'm always on a mission to find some Kung Pao that can beat Chows Asian Bistro in Albuquerque. Sadly it doesn't top Chows. The food was good don't get me wrong. As stated in a review from someone else. It's good not great. My girlfriend also got a Long Island Iced Tea. She said that was awesome. All in all not a bad place. I'd go here again probably."}
{"text":"We order take out here at least once a month for the orange chicken. I usually like to order 1 or 2 other dishes to try, but we haven't been impressed by anything else on the menu.  Now after this last visit, we will never order seafood here again! The lunch special Shrimp with vegetables came in a generous serving size but from the minute we opened the container, the smell and visual was off-putting. It smelled so fishy, the shrimp weren't cleaned, and the sauce was really thick and slimy, like raw egg whites. I tried some anyway, but it didn't have much flavor. If you come here, all we can recommend is the orange chicken. Even that is sometimes really greasy, but in general it tastes great. The spring rolls that come with lunch specials are very greasy most visits as well."}
{"text":"I ordered take out this Monday. I ordered 2 dinner combinations. I got the sweet and sour chicken and the Moo goo gai pan. It came with fried rice and a crab puff and an egg roll for each combo. The food was delicious and the hostess was friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner....share a dish unless you like a lot of take-home...it's not in the best of neighborhoods...but if you are in the area,eat here...very nice service and friendly wait-people"}
{"text":"First time eating at Good China... wow! Absolutely amazing! We had the Poo Poo platter for 2... plenty for 4 people! The beef skewers were really good. We ordered House Fried Rice, Mongolian Chicken and Orange beef. Everything was excellent and portions were huge. We have 3 boxes of leftovers. Staff was very attentive to every need. We will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"The noodles are amazing had for the first time with my girlfriend. Loved it. We will go again soon."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and I thought it was about time I wrote a review! First off, the waitress that we get almost every time Stephanie and she is just on it every time!! She just knows what we get every time we come in. Their food is always hot, and we just absolutely love the PuPu platter that they have. I personally love their crab puffs, I can eat those all day long, heck I could jus eat those and the PuPu platter the whole time and I would be happy lol!!! Good China is probably the best Chinese restaurant around town I would highly recommend this place to my friends! Now I will admit, I debated giving them 5 stars because some of their other servers aren't anywhere near as good as Stephanie is. But their food definitely outweighs the few immature servers there so. Again great food, start with their Legendary PuPu Platter!!!!"}
{"text":"Egg drop soup was delish. Good flavorful food.  Only complaint is that the chicken in my meal, as well as, my wife's seemed to have a lot of fat and tendons.  I prefer my meats trimmed better.  May have been the prep for the day.  Will try again"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Oriental dinner I've ever had. We ordered 3 combination dinners two of the container sides were filled with rice and the main course was not more than a cup of food. The egg foo young was terribly soggy and the snap peas we're also soggy. snow peas are supposed to be crisp and not overcooked. The bean sprouts in the egg foo young chapped up the so fine you wouldn't know it's a foo young. What a waste of $10. Our other two entrees or also very soggy like it's been taken out of the stewpot and served when needed. The Chinese restaurant across the street in the Fry's parking lot much better the food is fresh and crisp and not overcook"}
{"text":"Love this place- Wish I would have found it sooner!
Have dined in on 3 separate occassions, two of those being lunch hours. Great ambience, full menu, fresh food, generous portions and excellent service! Lunch hour specials are simply amazing. Your entrée comes with choice of Sweet and Sour soup or Egg Drop Soup, Eggroll, Fried rice, and a Crispy Wonton for under $7-8. Best in the West Valley! Stay Awesome Good China-"}
{"text":"The  food is good. I took it to go. When I got home I realized that part if my order was wrong.  I called them, the man I spoke to said to take a pic of the food to show it to him. I went in on the following day, and got my order replaced, and he even offered me some rice to go with it!!! Pretty good food.  Ill be going there again."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this restaurant again. Tonight I ordered Lemon Chicken and my friend ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken. They were both terrible. There was too much breading on the chicken and it was greasy. When I removed the breading, my fingers came back extremely greasy and there was hardly any chicken left. I would not recommend anyone trying these fried dishes. I've had these same dishes at other restaurants and they were excellent. And to top it off, last time I was here, the server was apparently not satisfied with their tip and added a few extra dollars to my bill. So make sure you check your bill if you do eat there."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in the NY/NJ area Asian food is something I have grown up with; along with any and most Ethnicity you can name.  The flavors in Arizona Asian Food, though somewhere in the vicinity of what it is back East is somewhat off.  When I ordered take out on this day, such was the case.  Two things I didn't like: the chicken wings were hard, hard, and hard.  Their sweet and sour soup was not good."}
{"text":"I like this places because the food always comes out fast and you get a lot of food for the price you pay. Obviously isn't going to be up to par with places such as PF Chang's, but I like supporting local business and prefer this over Pei Wei. Overall a happy medium but their prices-to-food portions alone make it a no brainer."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese restaurant for sure! I've eaten here several times. I'd say my favorite dish is the garlic chicken. There lunch specials are really good and very cheap. And they have a full bar."}
{"text":"This place has decent food, not too fancy but not bad. We've had mostly good service except once when the waitress was monotone with no greeting and made us feel almost like an inconvenience. She watched me with my two babies and disabled mother struggle to walk through the 2 sets of doors and just stood there offering no help. She literally just stood there and stared at us. It was so rude I wanted to walk right out but gave it a chance and just felt like she hated being a waitress the whole time. I would not choose to go here again."}
{"text":"The soup (hot and sour) was the highlight of the meal. Our male server was also very nice and attentive.  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch platter, and the chicken was drenched in a simple syrup sauce about 5 seconds away from being straight sugar. I absolutely hate sending things back, but I literally could not eat this dish.  I then ordered the Kung Pao chicken, and though slightly better, I would not recommend  it either.  I was really looking forward to good Chinese food after Christmas, but I did not find it here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here pretty much the last for the last four or five years for Christmas... And I must admit this was one of the worst Chinese meals I've ever had... We started with the four piece barbecue pork spareribs, they must've been pre-cooked and warmed in the microwave... you better have a good set of choppers because the meat was like shoe leather... My wife had the egg drop soup it was fair at best, I had the hot sour and it was not bad... My wife had the shrimp with vegetables... I had the shrimp chicken and pork with vegetables... My wife's shrimp we're not even warm and not even room temperature they were cold... I've put one aside for the waitress to touch she called over a manager and they replaced the meal... The service was horrendous and because it was so busy I felt like I was being served a meal during Air Force basic training which means hurry up chew and swallow and leave... Most of my reviews are extremely positive so it pains me to leave a horrible but honest review... Two stars is being very considerate of my part...."}
{"text":"Yum! We love Good China. Everyone is sooooo nice. They make the best egg drop soup. We are having lunch and it is delicious. Good portions too!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was horrible. Nothing had flavor, food was cold, tasteless and gross. We had to run through McDonald's to get my wife something and that was better than good china.  Would not recommend it"}
{"text":"Extremely clean restaurant, good location, friendly waiters, fast service, always freshly cooked food. Prices are great. You can't find a better Chinese restaurant in the area like Good China! We are regular customers an often eat here when we are in Northwest Phoenix."}
{"text":"The war wonton soup is the best in the Valley! Their portions are huge and we always have massive amounts of left overs. Try the chef specialties like the seafood platter and the special China chow mien. My favorite here is the Crispy Duck, Orange chicken and house lo mein. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times before and thought the food and service was OK because it was so very inexpensive, and close to where we live.   Today we experienced extremely poor service and extremely poor food.  I ordered a dish that was not normally spicy, nor did the menu say or indicate in any way that it was spicy.  When I slowly and graciously explained to the Chinese waitress that I could not eat the dish because it was way too spicy, she argued with me.  I said I would like to order a different dish instead.  She said I could NOT do that but she would take the same dish back to the kitchen and they would remove the spice.  I said to myself \"This will be interesting!\"  I did not at all make a scene because hey it is ONLY a dish at a poorly managed Chinese Restaurant.  They brought it back and I ate about a third of it.  It did not taste right at all to me.  She never came back to check again on our meal.  She never came back to get refills on our drinks.
We finally had to ask for the bill.  We will NEVER go back to the Good China Restaurant.  Never.  We will never recommend the Good China Restaurant, because we had a horrible experience there.  As another review here on Yelp said, I know I would never set foot in this restaurant again.  Bad China.  Unless you have to have the lowest price meal, and you can put up with poor service and poor food I sincerely suggest that you never set foot in this restaurant.  BAD CHINA!"}
{"text":"Since moving from the east coast to Peoria a couple of years ago, it seemed impossible to find a decent Chinese restaurant...but then we found Good China. Now, it's not THE best Chinese food I've ever eaten, but certainly the best I've had since moving here. Restaurant is dimly lit, casual, has reasonable prices, great lunch menu, is clean and nicely updated. The staff has been great every time I have eaten there. I have ordered take out on a Saturday evening and it was ready in 15 minutes. Portions for take out are just as large as when you dine in. My favorite dishes are chicken lettuce wraps (served warm), spring rolls (crispy and not oily), pork steamed dumplings and mu shu pork, which tastes very authentic and served with thin pancakes. Very yummy! We always share an order of pork fried rice, which is probably one of the best I've eaten, and Mongolian beef, which is nice and saucy and best eaten with white rice. I do find that the food here can tend to be salty, and you will need to make sure you've got something wet to chug a lug, but make sure it's not their tap water! It tastes like chlorine, every time. I don't drink soda, so I order iced tea, and I never taste any trace of tap water. It's our go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are always friendly, and they have the take out ready when they say they'll have it. The price point is good and great portions for the price.

I've only ever gotten take out."}
{"text":"Found this place about 6 years ago and I am still addicted! It is THE BEST orange chicken I've ever had. I go so much that they know me by name, my usual order, and always ask how my family and I are doing. It's kind of dark inside, so I usually grab take out, although my dine in experiences have been just as great. Every new person I bring here says they love it too!"}
{"text":"Love their food! Everything is fresh and tasty! Big portions come piping hot! 
When I get surprise company, this is my \"go-to\" place every time! Order is ready within 15 minutes! Guest rave about how good it is!!! Very clean, good atmosphere, one mile from the 101, exit Union Hills. Plenty of parking!"}
{"text":"Food is good, waiting times are short. Everyone is friendly. Serving sizes are huge so it'll fill up anyone and pricing is really reasonable."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.  Service was really friendly, and prompt.  Food was \"meh\", maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"All the 5 star reviews are very odd to me. 
Stopped in for lunch and got a lunch special.  Service was fast but poor.  Guy didn't even look at me when he took my order or put my drink down.  
More importantly, the food sucked. If this is \"the best Chinese on the West Side\" I am glad I live in Gilbert. The fried rice was terrible. Not really fried rice, just seasoned rice.  I got like a pound and it had about three bites of egg.  The egg roll was over sized, mealy and mostly cabbage.  I ordered the green onion beef and got the broccoli beef.  The beef was overcooked and chewy.  It came out fast so I bet it's on a warming table in back and seemed like it may have been there too long.  
They get 2 stars for the huge portions.  So if you are really hungry and have lost your sense of taste in an industrial accident try it out."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop place in Peoria.  You have to try their Lettuce wraps which are very refreshing and on the light side.  Dumplings are made fresh so if you order them they take 15-20 min to get.  Fried rice is to die for too!!"}
{"text":"Their food was delicious. My husband and I loved the egg drop soup. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. Their egg rolls where not that great but everything else was delicious and freshly made considering the tame we got there. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Very good service and the food was clean
Totally recommend for couples
Menu choices were a wide variety 
All good here"}
{"text":"This place deserves 6 Stars!
Was in the neighborhood on business and dropped in.  The place is clean, service is prompt and the menu was very reasonably priced. We asked for two waters with lemon and they gave us two large glasses with a generous portion of lemons in the water.  
Food portions are large--you won't be leaving here hungry.  Most importantly, the food is DEELISH!  Amazing food.  We had the lunch specials, $5.25 and $6.25 respectively.  The 6.25 dish was shrimp with lobster sauce and it  had 9 shrimp!  The fried rice that came with it had no meat in it but it was very tasty. The special also came with soup, an egg roll and a wonton. You can't beat that.  My companion had chicken with vegetables (5.25) which he requested very spicy and indeed he got it, very spicy. Most places you tell them spicy and they are afraid to do it.  Nicely Done!  Chicken was very tender. 
I can't believe a restaurant this good is so far out there on the west side.  If it was closer to home I would be there every day!   If you live close by, you should really give them business. I would hate for a place like this to go out of business (although I was told the place has been there for a while) 
I still have the egg rolls from the lunch in the fridge. Excuse me,  I think I will eat them now."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since childhood and I love everything they serve here. The egg drop soup and the sesame chicken are awesome. The servers are very friendly and will always try to make you laugh. I love bringing friends in here."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love the friend rice and orange chicken. It's all good.   It's a little far for us but worth the trip"}
{"text":"Every time I come to good China I get a sever named Jason and he always knows what I'm getting and some of the other severs know what I get too it's hard to find Chinese food places that know what the customer get every time I will be coming back to get my food at this restaurant"}
{"text":"So, this place will do in a naive and disconnected suburb diving relentlessly to achieve an even lower common denominator.
But it's all we have at the moment.
The search continues...
(None of the food warrants discussion)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and came quickly. The waitress was friendly but did not come back regularly to see if we needed anything, she also got our bills mixed up with the friends we were with, perhaps she had too many tables to wait on. Overall our party enjoyed the meal, will return again."}
{"text":"I had my birthday lunch their, \"It was WONDERFUL\". I had chicken egg foo young and pork fried rice. I also brought home 2 egg rolls and sweet and sour pork. The one thing I like about it, the sweet and sour was the best I ever had. Jason was a perfect waiter, and the soup was perfect too, from what my best friend told me!!"}
{"text":"Dirty table, food was not good. The dinner dishes lacked meat and veggies. My husband got chicken lo mein and it had hardly any chicken and the chicken that was in it was fried and didn't even look like chicken.  The egg rolls and crab rangoons were super greasy and nothing in them at all. The egg roll was just greasy cabbage. I got cashew chicken and it was mostly chopped celery and bamboo and frozen peas. The fried rice wasn't good either. Nothing but rice and cold We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and the restaurant is always nice a clean. Prices are ok for the portions they give you. The wait staff can be rude. When we were ordering, our waitress didn't even smile or greet us. She didn't give us time to look at the menu and when we said we needed time, she looked annoyed and walked away. She took our order, brought our food, and that was pretty much the interaction we had with her. Didn't fill up our water, we flagged another waitress and she was kind enough to refill our water. The only other time we saw our waitress was when she handed us the bill and came back to give us the receipt. No thank you,  nothing. Very poor customer service. I'm struggling giving whether to give this place 1 or 2 stars because, the food isn't bad, just unfriendly wait staff."}
{"text":"So the lunch price is amazing! You get plenty of food for the price! But why I gave it a two star was that i found a hair in my food. God was i disappointed tasty good food and it ended up with a hair inside of it. Just gotta watch out for that I know it's hard to keep control of it but I just can't stand them."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Always consistently awesome!   Very friendly atmosphere with great service.  Food is delicious and prices are affordable.  I drive all the way across town just to eat here."}
{"text":"Hands down our most favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  We've been driving 25 minutes across town to dine on their consistently delicious food for 10 years now.  I will make one note that we have learned the food is best when eaten at the restaurant vs driving home 25 min - it's not as crispy - so if that's important to you - keep in mind your drive time if ordering take out. 

Highly recommend the Orange Chicken**which is the BOMB**, Mongolian Beef, Cashew Chicken, SS Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, House Special Chowmein, Pepper Steak, Pork Fried Rice, Dumplings, Eggrolls, Crab Puffs, Egg Drop Soup, etc... 

Have never had a bad meal here in 10 years.  Service is historically very good, though the last time we were there it was slow despite being there late in the afternoon - but that is really unusual for this place and I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just an off day. (we all have those, don't we?!)  We have hosted family gatherings here and even with 15-20 people, the service & food were great. 

Also - side note - if you go to their website - they have coupons on there for free eggrolls or crab puffs or lettuce wraps.  

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp..... We've tried others since moving here a year ago.  This is our go to Chinese joint, very, very good!!!
We had Cashew Chicken, House Fried Rice and Singapore noodles.  Couldn't ask for any better, great friendly server and atmosphere.  
Took some home also."}
{"text":"Had take out.  Ordered the chefs special with shrimp, chicken, and asparagus.  Also ordered the orange chicken.  The chefs special was muy delicioso.  Lots of meat that was tender and flavorful.  Also lots of vegetables.  Carrots, mushrooms, and others.  The orange chicken was different but also tasty.  The chicken was crispy and thin and smothered in sweet sauce with a little bit of heat.  I recommend both of these dishes.  They didn't offer brown rice so I took a star for that.  The servers sat around and bitched at each other and it was a tad too pricey so I take another star for that.

All in all it was good and I will be back for more someday.  They also have coupons on their website if you are a tight wad like myself.  Peace."}
{"text":"Quiet atmosphere, good food, attentive staff. Will go again. We had pot stickers, Shrimp Lo Mein, and Sweet/Sour Pork. Loved that fried rice is standard in the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I work in this area and I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I have gone on two different occasions for lunch, once ordering a chicken dish and once ordering a beef dish.  I have to say, I find the meat to be super sketchy.  Neither the beef or the chicken actually tasted or resembled beef or chicken.  If anyone is familiar with the show \"The League\", the meat has a very \"Yobagoya\" vibe.  I really love chinese and the portions and prices are great, but I can't get past the mystery meat, so I will not return."}
{"text":"Suprised the reviews are still so high. This was one of our favorite Chinese food restruants. The food is still very good but the restruant has neen steadily declining the booths are in disrepair and have duct tape all over them. This last visit our server was short abrupt almost rude not freindly at all. This will be the last time we visit Good China."}
{"text":"Some of the absolute best egg drop soup I've ever had. Amazing service and food!! Chop suey was great also! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best chines food in the West Valley. The food is always hot and fresh. I love that their veggies in any of their plates are always crunchy. The house fried rice and egg rolls are the best in Phoenix.  I've had them cater for family gatherings and the quality is the same as if I were eating there. This is a must have whenever you're in the area. \"Thank you mi amigos\"  is the greeting and good by we receive whenever we are there."}
{"text":"This place is super bomb!! I recommend it!! So far the nest one ive tried since i moved here to az"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. ..almost all the dishes are under $10.00.. I gotta chicken curry dish for 6.95 and they gave me a decent size portion. Food is great I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service...!! If you're looking for good Chinese food you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience here ever. I lived close by most of my life and now go out of my way to drive here for the pot stickers. Omg they're ridiculously good!!"}
{"text":"the food is great! my kung pao chicken was absolutely delicious and wife's chicken lo mein was good too, fried rice was excellent and i enjoyed my hot and sour soup. i just wish there was more of it as portion sizes were pretty weak, especially the rice on the dinner combo meal. service was slightly suspect as well. our server jimmy had a very thick accent that made him difficult to understand and had an odd sense of humor with a couple \"witty\" lines he dropped. absolutely go for the food though,"}
{"text":"Don't know why this place isn't pack out all the time. Food is excellent... as good as Chinese food in Boston or Frisco. Service is good and place is always clean. Top marks from my group"}
{"text":"When you dine here, expect to receive a lot of food - you definitely won't go hungry. They serve standard Americanized Chinese fare, and I find the quality of the food to be a tad above most Chinese restaurants of this kind. Service is friendly and prices are good. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area (Maryvale), this is a good choice if you're hungry and want a lot of decent quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"My girlfriemd and I found this place on Yelp as we were wanting and in the mood for asian food.  In summary, this was a good find, tasty food, and well decorated.

We ordered several dishes and upon our initial receiving of the carry-out package, we were a little shocked.  As I have ordered take out from other locations, and the portions seemed a lot larger than these.  However, after plating everything, there was more than enough food.  All of the dishes were very flavorful, well prepared, and delicious.

The hostess was very courteous and polite.  Only came into contact with one waitress as she walked by, and maybe she was just having a bad day.

The inside does not match the outside.  The inside is very well decorated and nicely done.  It's a fine restraunt inside.  I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is definetly a hole in the wall, the 5 stars are based on food, service is fast but not overly friendly. Love their Seafood Soup."}
{"text":"Food was well prepared and had great flavor. Service was average."}
{"text":"Good China has been one of my families favorite places to get together for about 11 years now. We like to go for their awesome lunch specials. They have a full lunch menu with almost everything under 7-8 bucks. Your entrée comes with choice of Sweet and Sour soup or Egg Drop Soup, Eggroll, Fried rice, and a Crispy Wonton. I like to get their Sweet and Sour. I like the Shrimp, Pork, And chicken. Always quality meat. Tempura Batter is perfectly fried, ALWAYS. They have the best eggrolls with fresh cabbage, chicken, and great seasoning. The Plumb Sauce on the table along with the Hot Mustard is always fresh and great to dip just about any thing in. The portions they give you are always so generous that I end up taking my food home, almost every time. I will admit that is a hang out for the Sun City Folks, but hey... they must know good Chinese when they see it because this place is great. And you just cant beat it for the prices. Old people love low prices and so do I."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hoopla is about this place, service is good and prices are ok but the food was mediocre in my opinion. I would go back probably if it was closer to my house but based on the reviews I drove quite a ways so I will try to find something better closer to home."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me $55.00 for Sweet and sour chicken... Shrimp fried rice and 5 egg rolls!!!! Never ever again! Not to mention... They didn't deliver!! WTH!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, some of the best kung pao I've had. Wait staff is very attentive and friendly. Nice place."}
{"text":"They make the best \"House Fried Rice\"  that i know of. Everytime i order i get a stamp, and my next meal is free.."}
{"text":"Tried them for lunch. Ordered orange chicken which came with soup, won ton, rice and egg roll. Disappointed in the entree, chicken sliced way too thin then fried resulting in eating fried piece s of nothing would rate it a 1. One chili on the menu was not hot at all. Hot and sour soup was good but my serving lacked any shrimp or chicken like I am used to at Abacus Inn. Rice average. Egg roll perhaps the best item I ate here today."}
{"text":"I am sorry that I didn't try this place sooner. It's divey, dark, and cheesy in decor but the food was excellent and plentiful with great service. 

While there was nothing there I hadn't had before, it was really the service that stood out--though the food is very very good. Our server, Julie, was great--kept our drinks full, delightfully, and even got to know the kids at our table to call them by name to help them feel special. 

I had the chicken and asparagus special. It was terrific. My son had the moo shi house special which he loved. I wish they would have put the plum sauce on prior to rolling, but they brought a squeeze bottle filled with it to add as much as you like. We enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken, and beef and broccoli as well. All were very good. The egg rolls are exceptional. 

We look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good Lo Mein. Not always consistent. We sometimes get good and suggestions get not so good. The venue is decent. The employees could be much more courteous."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often. This evening, for the first time, we had a bad experience.  Everything was good except for the chicken in the dish I ordered. When I told the waitress she became really rude and said it was my fault. I pointed out that I did not cook the chicken and she just got nastier about it. I have always told my friends how good this place is. I will be sure to tell them about this experience."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood Chinese place. Food is good, price is right. 

Lunch specials are really nice."}
{"text":"I agree with Hank. The prices are very reasonable (a lunch combo is $5) and they give you a ton of food. My group ordered, S&S Pork, Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Kung Pao chicken... no one was dissappointed. (Plus, they only use white meat chicken - bonus!!)"}
{"text":"This please really should be called Not That Good Chinese!!!  Egg drop soup is terrible.  Totally flavorless!  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken combo.  It was suppose to come with an egg roll and craps puffs.  Never saw the crab puffs.  Egg roll was the only good thing about this place. When food was brought to the table the server didn't offer any chili or sweet and sour sauce for the egg roll.  I'm so disappointed.  I really wanted to like this place.

I gave two stars mainly because the place is very beautiful."}
{"text":"We have been here 5-6 times in last 3-4 months and the food is always really good and the service is really nice too.  Look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing prices!! A family owned business for many years so the quality is very consistent. Orange chicken, Mongolian chicken/beef, general tso chicken, fried rice, seafood soup, sizzling rice soup are among my favorites. The portions are big enough to share and the prices are even better! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go to lunch today. She selected good China since. I was very dissatisfied.  I ordered shrimp in lobster sauce. It was horrible I ate 2 shrimp. The first shrimp I thought maybe it's me I tried another. It wasn't me. I asked the server if I could exchange for something different he said no that's what I ordered. I asked for a manager to see if they could extend some type if customer service. Instead I got you ordered it there's nothing we could do.  Really. Horrible customer service. No one said sure let me get you the menu. To see what else you would like I didn't ask them to pay for the horrible first meal. I just wanted to order something else since I was there for lunch. Needless to say I won't be back. Shame on you for such bad customer service"}
{"text":"Ok so grading this is hard but this is based on my interaction when I called to place a pick up order :
Girl: does her greeting 
Me: I'd like to place an order 
Girl: gets phone number and name then... asks me do I know where they are located . I respond yes and she answers in a snotty way . Where are we ??
Um excuse me ? I know where you are I'm not good with street names but I have been to your place a million times . 
I was taken aback but her questioning me when I said I know where you are located . 
I placed the order and needless to say the food was good but I doubt I'll go back because of there way I was talked to ."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special. $7.25. Includes hot and sour or egg drop soup, wonton, egg roll, and small serving of fried rice. Asked for it spicy, it had not heat whatsoever. The Mongolian beef was more onion than beef (which I like). It could have used more sauce but the flavor was good. Egg roll was greasy but pretty standard from my experience. It paired well with the plum sauce. Service was non existent, which was fine by me. I'll be back due to the price and taste."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. Sizzling rice soup, was off the hook! Yummy! Low Mein! Kung Pao Chicken! Mixed Veggies with white sauce. So great - food & service. Plus Juan the waiter was attentive and quick... he was just simply amazing, helpful and informative.

I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here one time and one time only. Got the vegetable fried rice and it was nothing special. With so many more options in the area I'll just go somewhere else next time. This place should be called Just Okay China Restaurant. I give this place"}
{"text":"Saw them on check please,got the orange  chicken with fried rice,awesome,wife got kung pow chicken,awesome,luncheon special 2 adults $15.50 ,cm on thats a deal ,new yrs eve we will be orderinorderingg!!!!!You would think you were eating gourmet chinese food,try it I guarantee  the best around."}
{"text":"I have to admit this place is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Cheap lunch special, tons of food..... can't get any better than that. I had the sweet and sour chicken and it was soooooo good. I barely put a dent in my plate because there was so much food. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since China Rainbow changed owners and went downhill. Tried Good China twice. The first time the food was okay but the waitress was as surly as we've ever experienced. The second time, the waitress was sweet, perky and extremely scarce, had to wait forever to first get the check and then get our credit card back. The food...not so good, beef with chinese vegetables was 90% zucchini and the vegetable lo mein was tasteless."}
{"text":"Hot & Sour soup is a favorite of ours and since the old Eddie Chan's closed and sold the name we have searched.  Good China makes a nice one, plus their luncheon menu is well priced, the portions are more than ample and the food is tasty.  The only negative we found were the egg rolls which were very good but soaked up oil.  A much hotter frying oil would crisp them up and rate them up there with the Hot & Sour Soup.  Overall, good, inexpensive lunch with a pleasant atmosphere and nice people.  Try it, we will again."}
{"text":"Out of the Chinese places near by its not the worst but has room for improvement. The food is greasy, although the Mongolian beef is decent the rest of it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  We started with the po po platter which was probably the highlight of the evening.  When ordering dinner our children ordered soda which we told our server not to bring until dinner arrived.  It was on the table 30 seconds later  We ordered the crispy duck and happy family for our entre.  The happy family was advertised a shrimp, chicken and beef.  There were 2 pieces of shrimp and 3 pieces of beef, I know, I counted.  It was served on a large platter and spread out thin which I can only guess was to make it look like more.  The duck which our server told us was a crispy fried half of duck was an assortment of bones and skin with no piece having more than one bite of meat.  What's terrible is that these were 2 of the higher priced entrees on the menu.  Our server always seemed like she was in a hurry to go somewhere else.  No chance I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years it is definitely to go to comida china. The servers there are too real if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Sorry...went back Friday at lunch and had absolutely slow service and they were not that busy.  Ordered lunch specials and my wife's egg roll was served on the side of the moo goo gai pan, swimming in the sauce.  POOR!

Sorry, Jason - you can't take 4 orders at one time!  You forget things.

Please, please don't become one of those!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Chinese places. The servers and bussers always greet you and are attentive to you. Their Chicken  & Broccoli is the best ever. Always perfectly tender in a light white sauce that's creamy and flavorful. I also like their moo goo gui pan and their chicken lo mein. Their combination lunches and dinners are great. You get soup, egg roll, and crab puff, with fried rice and your main dish for cheap."}
{"text":"Love love love Good China!
We use to live here in Peoria, just down the street from Good China. We started coming years ago. They understand and accommodate me for my special gluten allergy.  I really love the Singapore rice noodle, you can order is mild or hot.
Free hot tea, although, they charge for iced tea, tea is tea hot or cold, just sayin.
Probably the best egg drop soup i have ever had. We don't live in Peoria anymore, but we don't mind driving over because its our favorite!
I have my family hooked too.  Very clean and nice atmosphere.  I really don't get some of these negative reviews, as many times as we have been here, i have zero complaints. 
They are good with Groups too! Full service bar and they are always really busy with take out orders. I especially like that they remember us when we come in. 
Making me hungry right now!"}
{"text":"Good food and reasonably priced
I just wish they had delivery available.

Had the Sweet and Sour shrimp dinner combo"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Portions seem a little small for the price. Service is always great just wasn't the most impressive orange chicken."}
{"text":"I previously gave this place with 5 stars. The food is terrific and their flavors are spot on. The reason why they have 2 stars taken off is those dirty plates + glasses. We found some black thing on our water.For me cleanliness is so freaking big deal. I would still come here and give them one more chance. Mind you, this is my 3rd visit when this happened. The previous visits were all good. I hope the manager let the guy know to clean the plates better. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered for pickup and it was ready in 15 minutes! Very fast especially on a Saturday night. We got orange chicken, broccoli beef, and happy family. It came with a pint and a half of fried rice. A lot of food!! Our favorite was the happy family and the broccoli beef. The brown sauce they come in is delicious. Happy family is beef, chicken, shrimp, and a bunch of vegetables like zucchini and broccoli and water chestnuts all in a tasty brown sauce. Super healthy and cooked just right. The orange chicken wasn't greasy at all (which is rare for orange chicken) so I would say it is healthier than usual and was extra crispy and had little carrot and orange shreds on it. The service was fast and the food was delicious. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Good China is the place to go if your on a budget, want good food, and want to invite some friends or family. This is the place we go whenever we want to share some laughs. Our family consists of eight people and we usually order an order of: Broccoli beef, Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef, and sweet and sour. Reviews are true the owner or manager is kind of rude at times but you can't beat the prices and the food. 

Also, if you work near by they have lunch specials nothing is over $6.50, and you get fried rice almost everything on the regular menu, and an egg roll. Can't beat those prices."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. Good ambience.

It is hard to find this combination in the west valley."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner again last night and once again it was excellent! So good we ended up taking some \"to go\" because the house special fried rice cannot be beat! Guess what's for lunch tomorrow! Also the hot and sour soup was some of the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This my favorite local Chinese restaurant for takeout. Though it looks very nice for table service, we have yet to dine in, but keep meaning to. Food is always done quickly (quoted 10-15 minutes every time) and is always fresh and tasty. It's a bit more expensive than the more casual Chinese places, but IMO worth it. Love the quality and portions are generous. 

We love their fried rice, orange beef, and happy family. They have an interesting \"Chinese-style\" teriyaki chicken, which is a teriyaki application with crispy fried dark meat chicken. Surprising, but pleasant. Their egg foo young comes with generous amounts of meat/seafood/veg and gravy piled on top. It's a guilty pleasure. Also, they use a very thick noodle for their lo mein, almost like linguine, which was another surprise compared to other restaurants. You end up with a really hefty noodle dish, in a good way. Looking forward to trying more of the menu.

The people at the front are always very nice. We'll definitely be back and would recommend to anyone looking for dine-in or takeout. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions and good price. Had the beef fried rice, sweet&sour pork and house egg foo young. All yummy especially the fried rice."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the family dinner. The sizzling rice soup alone was worth the trip. The PooPoo platter was just OK--nothing spectacular, but by the time our entrees arrived we were pretty full. We had Moo Goo Gai Pan and Orange Beef with Pork fried rice. All were superlative. We got a total of 5 meals out of it. Highly recommended, bring lots of hungry people and don't over-order. We will be back to explore the. menu. Really more like 4-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I have gone here three times and been nothing but impressed. Orange chicken, mongolian beef, salt and pepper shrimp; all wonderful. The staff is one of the friendliest and most helpful around."}
{"text":"The house fried rice & the shrimp fried are great. The shrimp are very large. The only problem is the dining area is to small & the wait time is to long."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for many years and have always had consistently good food and good service. It is a nice little place to come to for lunch."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant is good China....I call it BAD CHINA!!!! The service was ok.....it was busy....but after I tasted the bland food......I knew I would never set foot in this restaurant again. Bad China!!"}
{"text":"Yummy spot. 

Went here with the in-laws after some golf. The hot & sour soup is delicious, as is their sweet & sour combo and chicken lo mein. 

My only \"complaint\" is that the chicken lo mein noodles were spaghetti size and I was really looking for the wide fat egg noodles (chow fun, I guess)...this is most likely an error on my part because I had a hard time hearing the waitress's response to my question and was going by body language and hand gestures.

No matter, it was delicious anyway, the prices are awesome (check out the combo meals) and their iced tea is VERY good and freshly brewed."}
{"text":"We recently had good china cater our small party of 25 guests and the food was a big hit! For less than $10/guest we all ate delicious food and it was so easy for serving and clean up! It came with 25 egg rolls, steamed rice, and 4 dishes of our choice. We went with veggie fried rice, cashew chicken, Mongolian chicken, and orange beef and there was plenty of food and leftovers! If you are in need of food for your next party and want something different than pizza or subs then give Good China a try and you will delight all of your guests."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the restaurant a couple of nights ago for dinner.  We were greeted at the front door and were seated immediately with menus.  The waitress came over to get our drink orders and that was the last we saw of her for about 15 minutes.  The restaurant was not busy and I saw at least 2 other servers working their butts off.  After waiting, my friend decided to go search out the waitress.  Upon passing the hostess area, he noticed people waiting to be seated and no one in sight.  He went over to the bar areas and there were our waitress along with a few other employees having a chat session and playing on their phones.  When confronted the waitress got all huffy and came over to our table quickly and look at me and said \"What you want?\"  Everything else with the dinner was fine.  The food was very good, we received refills quickly, she even came over to make sure every was alright and if we needed anything else.  While we were eating, most of the time she was talking to the couple behind us complaining about how many hours she has to work (loudly enough so that we could hear).  Didn't know if this was some kind of sympathy play or what?  Anyhow, she brought the check and returned with the receipt and said \"Next time I move faster\".  LOL  If this review was based on food alone it would probably get a 4 or a 5.  The service would get a 0.  Good China / Bad Service."}
{"text":"Another overpriced American Chinese restaurant....$25 for steamed rice, asparagus chicken and pepper beef... the flavors were off and nothing close to good Chinese food. Can't expect much from Arizona I guess"}
{"text":"We have ordered from the menu on three occasions for carry-out, and overall find the selections fresh and delicious. We have not yet visited the restaurant for table service. The venue is subdued and has been crowded both at lunch and dinner, quiet with nice ambiance.

For carry out, the food was nicely packaged , ready on time and quickly presented. I would not recommend the egg rolls which were deep fried, hard and dry. The egg foo yung was mushy but tasty. Exceptional is the shrimp and vegetables, General Tao chicken, and other traditional Chinese dishes. Average rating for fried rice and white rice that is consistently dry and flavorless. We received one flavorless fortune cookie for four, and ribs were gristle"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time today for lunch. Service was friendly and quick. Food is good and not too expensive. Portions are generous. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Very nice decor.  Food is just average.....too salty.  Never have been to  Chinese restaurant that charges for hot tea and noodles......a small saucer size plate of noodles for 75 cents.  Shanghai Grill across the street is much better, though not as nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I loooove this place!!!! Best Chinese food ever! Portions are great and prices are very reasonable considering the quality of food. Service is excellent! Everything on the menu is good nothing is bad. You must eat here if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I don't know why I am doing this review I don't think anyone is going to read it. Most of the people in this area are fairly elderly and I'm not sure they use yelp to figure out where to go, mainly word-of-mouth I'm sure. 
I love this place because this is where my parents used to go when they live here in Peoria, unfortunately they're no longer with us. So I come here mainly for nostalgic reasons and the food is pretty darn good as Chinese food goes. I am more of a Thai guy but I like this place and will keep coming back when I'm in town. One of my favorite dishes is the curry vegetable dish and their vegetable fried rice. 
I've been here twice in a week and both times they have CNN playing on their TV  :-(  that's the only thing I don't like, let's get rid of the fake news. 
This area seems to be conservative I can't imagine somebody hasn't complained yet.
My parents haven't lived here for over seven or eight years now and the place is aging well, Could use a few redos I think it's the same carpet.
 Will be back when I can."}
{"text":"Tried Good China for the first time tonight. General Tso's Chicken and fried rice was excellent. Service was fast and friendly (call in order). Prices are reasonable. This will definitely be on our list of go-to places in the future."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here a few days ago. All of the food I ordered tasted like it was cooked in hot and sour soup. The lo mein did not look like lo mein at all. None of the food was appetizing. 

I added a star because it was the friendliest service I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, the service would not be enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is large clean and the people and service were good. But the food is just average  We had a group of 5 people all the dishes came served just warm."}
{"text":"Great food! My favorites are sizzling rice soup (great when you're sick), poopoo platter, cashew chicken, house lo mein and house fried rice. The staff is very friendly and if you call to pick it up, it usually  takes 10 minutes. You can also find coupons for free lettuce wraps or crab puffs in the mailer ads."}
{"text":"you get really great food one time, and poor quality the next.. the food never taste the same 

anyways I will never eat here again last time I bit into sweet n sour chicken and had a bone in it, plus it just didnt taste right wasnt crispy at all just tasted old and soggy

must admit they never disappointed me with there crab puffs 

tip- never get take out last hour thats when the bad experiences have occured"}
{"text":"I went to Good China and bought 4 entrees to take out.  I drove 5 miles home and proceeded to have dinner.  For the cost of the food, one would expect it to be pretty good but that was not at all the case with Good China.  All 5 people who ate the food thought it was mediocre at best.  A waste of money.."}
{"text":"I have yet to be dissapointed with the service here. When I call or come in I am greeted by name, which just makes everything better from the begining.

The lunch specials are a little more that some places, but not by much and they are well worth it. I don't know if there are any resturant unique items that they have, but they serve the usual Chinese food, just at a better quality. If you are looking for a good lunch, try the Mongolian Beef or Sweet and Sour Chicken.

A must have is their Crab Puffs, these have more flavor here than I can recall having anywhere else. Try them and love them!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and not by choice either. Food is not good. Limited options for kids as well.  The service is slow and overall not worth it."}
{"text":"I heard some good things about this restaurant so decided to try it. We were seated quickly by friendly and efficient staff.  We needed some clarification about the duck choices, and made a decision. We then ordered an egg roll appetizer. The eggrolls came without any dipping sauce, and was put on the table without comment by our server. We had to ask for the sauce. The duck order was incorrect and our server asked if we wanted it or would rather wait another 20 minutes for the correct order. We opted to wait while we shared the other dish, Gen. Tso's chicken.  We had to tell the server to leave the other dish on the table as she started to take it away. When the duck came it had no garnish and didn't look appetizing at all. It was pretty good however. The Gen. Tso's was also good, but could have been a bit crispier. I really liked the heat level. Just right. There were no mints or orange with the check, which would have been nice, and no offer of dessert. This is a lovely restaurant with incredible selections and good food. The could step it up a bit, but we'll try it again and just assume our server was having a bad day."}
{"text":"its all in the name!! There food is great. We used to drive some distance to eat here and thankfiully we are close to it now. We always order the chicken lo mein.. IT IS SOOOOO GOOD. All of their food that we have tried is great. Plus if you eat in at lunch time you can get a combo with soup, egg roll one crab puff and what ever you choose for $5.. WISH THEY DELIVERED :) Happy eating

Items we have eaten and would recomend:
chicken lo mein
egg rolls
beef and broccoli
orange chicken
shrimp,chicken fried rice"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant that I've eaten at 20 times probably in the last 7 years, and it has always been good when I went into the place to eat.  This last time we did take-out, and what a disappointment when it came to their cashew chicken.  This is my go-to meal, so I know how it should look and taste.  So, it was a huge disappointment when my take-out cashew chicken had not only so very few cashews in it.  Is Good China starting to scrimp on extras?  If so, that is usually a sign a place is going downhill and saving money due to it.  I hope not.
Good China has always been...well, good.  But this last time, no bueno.  So why?  Hoping they get back to snuff on their take-out soon.  I'd hate to see this place go out of business."}
{"text":"Reeereee good food!  Me rikee....arot!"}
{"text":"Bad experience for me on this restaurant Hair on food and cockroaches on table that's all I am saying!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant. But they changed the menu the Cherokee chickens nowhere near as good as it used to be. And they don't do any type of substitution so you have to have rice... you can't have the lo mein noodles. They got our order wrong and when their food finally did come it was cold"}
{"text":"They make the best shrimp fried and chicken fried rice you'll find in Arizona. The area may be rough, but don't let that deter you from trying their food! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"My co-workers took me to this place today , and I got to say it was delicious and service was spectacular. I recommend and will be going back ."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect but tried this place for the first time on MLK day.

I thought it was really good for a dive Chinese joint. 

I had the kung pao chicken lunch special. It's a standard dish but I think they did a great job with it. It had lots of cubed vegetables and tender chicken with plenty of peanuts over the top. It came with plain fried rice, which was hot and fresh. It also came with a large egg roll that I enjoyed. It was mostly cabbage but had a good home made flavor and was fried correctly without being too greasy. And the free egg drop soup was tasty as well. It was almost like a combination of egg drop and cream of chicken soup. I'm picky when it comes to egg drop soup, but I liked Good China's version. 

It was more than I could eat. With a coke, it cost around $7.50. You can't go wrong. If you're on the west side, hit them up."}
{"text":"I love this place one of my favorite Chinese food places to go to. You get so much food. Sizzling rice soup is bomb. I love everything I have eaten here over the years. I also love to have a nice cup of hot tea too. The service is fast and friendly. Everything is fresh too. You know these guys must be doing something right if they have been open probably almost if not more than 20 years."}
{"text":"I'm not sure but i think they changed cooks cause the food used to be delicious but now its barley even has any taste to it. Plus it just dosent look appetizing. My wife and i used to love this place. Im glad we are moving back to mesa where i can visit my favorite place golden egg roll."}
{"text":"It's a really nice and comfortable family-operated restaurant. All items on their menu are delicious in great portions and at affordable prices. Great for families or friends to meet for gatherings. Absolutely love their orange chicken and sizzling rice soup!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, not great service. The hot and sour soup was too sour and sweet. The chicken is not good quality. Cheap quality overall."}
{"text":"The food was okay just like every other Chinese restaurant. The place looked okay on the inside also: clean. But the thing that bothered me the most was the smell of fish. Why does it smell like fish? I don't think they were cooking fish. The smell grossed me out so much I will never ever go there again"}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food. Best we have found in the area.  Large portions, friendly people."}
{"text":"I think this place is great tried it 2xs now and will definitely be back for more items to try.  Wonton war soup was amazing when I had a bad cold. Just great!! Will come for sit down service next.  Mongolian beef was awesome too.  Different but delicious. Not like other AZ Asian food places. I'm picky and this was good!"}
{"text":"Finally decide to pay a visit to this place in Peoria, which is an hour drive for me. Was not expect to be as good as it seem in my photos. It actually fill me up very well. 

The place is clean with nice interior decoration. I spent 4 hours there eating 4 dishes and chat with the staff and the owner. It was a great experience that you don't usually get from Chinese restaurant. This place is also huge inside. 

I like their foods and friendly services."}
{"text":"I love their orange chicken and hot and sour soup! The service isn't really the best though and they are SO stingy with their white rice for some reason? It's so weird because rice is probably the cheapest thing there. Also you get more food when ordering take out which is nice but make sure you double and triple check you have everything and the right stuff because we have had multiple orders be wrong when we get take out. Which is frustrating when you get home and don't have enough or the right food."}
{"text":"We have gone here for many years and have always enjoyed our meals and the service. 
My low review was for our visit on Christmas Day. We made a 5pm reservation, didn't get seated til 6:30! Our party if 8 was squeezed into table for 6 at most. We asked yo be moved snd finally was moved to a bigger table. We all ordered dinners and 2 appetizer platters. Most of the food finally came but we were missing an order of fried rice, an order of noodles and one entire meal! I asked for the missing meal 3 times and never got it. We never were offered drink refills either. The bar was covered in dirty glasses. I felt bad for the staff there was no way they could keep up. 
Lesson learned not to go here on Christmas. Our other visits were much better."}
{"text":"Service - sketchy...um appetizers are served BEFORE the entree not AFTER.
Seems they bring the food out as it is cooked, but the cook has no timing. Some were eating the soup course while others had nothing then some had entrees and the other soup was served, all in all a mess.

Food- OK nothing to write home about, but I did have an awful stomach ache most of the night after eating here. No one else did, I was the only one who had the General Tso chicken though so the verdict is still out.

Would I return, probably not, but others in our party like the place so they probably will."}
{"text":"When you want Chinese, but pretty much every other place for it in the area is closed, Good China will treat you well. Unlike certain other places across the street who freak out and close early if they don't feel like taking a to-go order with a half hour to spare, GC invites you to come in and sit down, even if it's a bit late. 

But do you wanna sit in another generic strip mall restaurant with zodiacs plastered everywhere? Boring, right? 

In like 5 minutes, my order was done. Sesame chicken, my go-to this-is-how-I'll-judge-your-establishment dish, was pretty good, albeit a bit soggy, not crisp as I am used to. The crab puffs were terrible and barely had any filling whatsoever. What a bust. 

I mean, I *ate* it all though, that's what matters right? This isn't a detailed review, really, I'm just saying that if you really want Chinese food after 8pm around here, this is edible."}
{"text":"I'm used to more authentic chinese food rather than Southwest Chinese.  I missed the 
Chinese flavoring from the San Francisco area.  Food was ok, but I'll not go back."}
{"text":"I'm always on a quest for General Tso's chicken. You really wouldn't think that Chinese food would be regional in the US but it is really different here than the east coast. If you are from the east coast...do not get the General Tso's chicken here...you will be disappointed. I did find a place that is pretty darn close. Follow me or look at my reviews if you want to know where. Anyway, they have pretty amazing food here. The pepper steak is the best I've found in the West valley. The lettuce wraps are delightful too. Not too crazy about their egg rolls though. They seem to be a bit on the soggy side. I usually get it to go on the way home. Since I don't eat in I couldn't feel good on giving any extra stars. I'll edit my review if I ever dine in. Suffice it to say that the food is pretty good here and I've never been unsatisfied."}
{"text":"When we returned to the area we figured we try our old restaurant. What a shock and disappointment! Food tasted as if frozen then reheated, little or no flavor as previous visits in the past. For the money there are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Been eating at Good China for over 20 years now. It started from 67th ave & Thomas then 91st ave & Olive, now this location. Always enjoy their food & they're prepared fresh every day. Spring egg rolled are made fresh not bought like most establishments & lettuce wraps are a must."}
{"text":"When your tired of eating at big chain restaurants such as Pf's, Pei Wei's ect.. Give this place a try. Been eating here since the mid 90's with my wife & I now we bring our kids every now & then. This establishment has always stayed consistent with their food as far as taste. Our favorite's are egg rolls & egg drop soup with hot tea. We've tried all their main entrées & they are all delightful. At the end you'll be surprised & satisfied with the pricing. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a to go lunch special of sweet and sour chicken and fried rice. The roll that came with it was greasy but quite good. The main entree was tasty but the fried rice lacked. It was just fried rice, no egg or anything special. It was good for the price and the establishment had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Orange Beef, best thing on the menu. We love this place. Many a birthday has been spent here. Great service, very friendly place."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot for lunch some 6 years ago, I made my first visit since I've been back in AZ tonight. I gotta say it has really changed, the food is different and not necessarily in a good way, the portions are smaller and the prices are higher. I guess it the unavoidable evolution of things. The meal we had tonight was decent, my shrimp in lobster sauce was more slimy than goopy, and the rice was bland. I must say tho that the waiter was friendly and helpful and the potstickers were delicious. I'd come again, but would order something different next time."}
{"text":"It was ok food, but not the fabulous War Wonton soup that you can find at most chinese restaurants in the valley.  My sister warned me that they nickel and dime you on everything, and they do. 

The food was ok and so too were the prices. I was happy to pay for what I asked for, but it is annoying.  I would prefer they up the plate prices $1 instead of charging for crispy chips with soup. 

Seemed to be a language barrier when the guy didn't understand that I also ordered fried wontons, but then we realized he just wasn't paying attention."}
{"text":"The first few times I went here I didn't think it was anything special but now it's become one of my favorite Chinese places to eat. The orange chicken is AMAZING! And I love the egg drop soup.. and the wonton soup :) Great prices as well! When I go in town to visit I always make sure to stop by once.. Or twice :)"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"gross\"!  This was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  The tofu was slimy and soggy and the Mongolian beef was not like anything I'd ever seen before.  The waitress was rude and slammed our food on the table and bolted.  PLEASE save yourself the disappointment and drive a few blocks over to P.F Chang's - yes it is a chain restaurant, but they are successful for a reason.  Food, service, and atmosphere is stellar there. Will NEVER be back to Good China."}
{"text":"More like Bad China, I say. 

Got take-out. Kung Pau chicken, curry shrimp, beef brocolli 2 egg rolls. 

Kung Pau was 90% celery and the chicken that was there was very very poor; tough, just crappy cuts...awful bland taste too. The beef brocolli was also bland, and the beef was poor quality...very tough. The curry shrimp was \"ok\". The eggrolls sucked!! 

I paid over $30 and will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out dinner. Picked it up 20 minutes before they closed. Half the ingredients were missing from the main dish AND the egg rolls they promised were not there. Go back the next day to correct this. They argued with me and kept me waiting for 20 minutes. The manager said \"fine I will get you four egg rolls \" and then walked away. 5 minutes later she gave me a bag and said heres your meal again. STILL NO EGG ROLLS. Instead of arguing more I just left. Too much competition to deal with their poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese food place in our neighborhood with decent prices. Orange chicken and pork fried rice are must haves! Yum!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Good China Restaurant for years.  We never order off of the menu.  We just ask the owner (Julie Situ) to serve us wonderful food.   We have never been disappointed and we always bring the leftovers home and eat every last grain of rice and every tender morsel!  Chinese food does not get any better than this.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the seating is very comfortable.  The staff are very attentive.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday,delicious.  Very friendly staff and great value"}
{"text":"Singapore rice noodles and honey walnut shrimp are my favorite dishes! Great portion! Must try! The service is very friendly. Great atmosphere. My favorite Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Such good food and such great service. JUAN was a great waiter he was very speedy and informed about the food and it's ingredients. I highly recommend eating here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I don't usually do bad reviews but the servic e isn't great. When I call to place an order they put me on hold and then never get back. I was on hold for 10 mins at one time and my husband has called and they answer and hang up. We kept trying them but always struggled with this issue. It's sad because we like the food thumbs up to the cooks but maybe some customer service classes for the girls"}
{"text":"Peanuts in Garlic Chicken, since when?  This place used to be good, but not anymore.  Wonton Soup salty, charge u for fried noodles.  Other restaurants those are free....."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but it did lack flavor. They have great lunch prices and fast service....but, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was a great place!! Beautiful inside. Quiet. Nice music. Great prices. From the outside I thought it was a fast food place. Inside is gorgeous!!"}
{"text":"Good food!  Horrible service. Brought the wrong drink, then waited 10 min for the right one, no refills.  Gave up on getting the check, just went to the register and waited for ticket.  No one ever smiles."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food restaurant in town. I come maybe twice a month, and it's always treated me well. My order starts with egg rolls and sizzling rice soup which is really good with clean cut chicken and great broth and is good with the Chile oil on table then orange chicken and house fried rice! You can't go wrong in this place and their staff is really accommodating as well!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Service was just okay, but this is common because of their culture and I respect this!

The food was good, we shared the sweet and sour pork and the house fried rice. The sweet and sour pork was good but not great. The house fried rice was very good and well balanced, little salt and lots of meat throughout. I would eat there fried rice again. 

We have found it difficult to find great Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area. This is one of the better ones we've tried."}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean restaurant, absolutely gorgeous wooden Buddah table next to the bar. When I arrived I should have known what to expect when a bus of elderly retirees were leaving. This is not authentic Chinese food. Bad sauces. Too much sugar. No balance of sweet, spicy and salty. I'm really disappointed because I was referred by Check Please Arizona (channel 8). The sauces were terrible in flavor. Proteins were delicious and so were all the veggies. I think I came when chef was having an off night. I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! They were rude and condescending towards our questions. Food is disgusting, too. The fried rice was just regular rice, the orange chicken was far from orange chicken, and the egg rolls are gross. Do not go here!"}
