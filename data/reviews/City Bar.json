{"text":"First impression: I loved the feeling that I was descending a dark, dank stairway into a speakeasy.  As if I have personal experience with that?!  But I digress.  I really dug the atmosphere: very low-key, with mood lighting and plush leather sofas.  Good beer selection.  Scary-ass bathrooms--not to mention that the stairs leading to them are a total drunk trap.

But overall I'm a fan."}
{"text":"If you like your bars racist in an \"underground\" way do visit City Bar. I stopped in with my Husband for an seltzer and the bar manager and patrons were stating loudly how they were Not racist and how they, \"Have black friends\". This made me as a Person of color Very uncomfortable as the bar was decidedly a white whatever that means , unfortunately now I know. I let them know I was aware of what they were doing and that the management should make it known that \"colored\" people like me are not welcome and walked out. By the way the worst part was that the bar manager was the ring leader."}
{"text":"It can sometimes get too crowded and cell reception is a zero, but I love this place. Friendly bartenders and good mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I have never been straight up ignored or experienced such rudeness at a bar in my life until last Friday.

Came here for the second time with a friend. We were completely ignored by the bartenders and other service staff. 

We were standing at the bar for five minutes as a young female bartender, literally within one feet away, was chatting casually with patrons next to us who have already been served. It was obvious we were waiting to place an order. She did not even acknowledge us. The place was not busy at all. 

This made us seething with anger. My friend could not help but to think she was ignored possibly because of her age (she's in her mid-40s). And I am a person of color. So who knows? All we do know is that no polite customer should ever be treated with such disrespect.

So unfortunately for them, and fortunately for us, we left to go to Cooper's Tavern where the service, drinks and ambiance are excellent."}
{"text":"Bar tenders took awhile to acknowledge and serve us despite no one there. Staff was rude, did not appreciate a group trying to have a good time on an early Friday evening. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Thank you City Bar for making my husband's birthday party a success!  Kevin was very accommodating to our special requests, extending Happy Hour pricing due to the size of our group.  

We were delighted with the food.  I had expected typical bar food, but the sandwiches and fish fry were very well prepared with high quality ingredients.  

Service was great!  My party was the bulk of the customers and we were treated very well.  The bartender worked with us to re-create some favorite shots from our college days. The place started to fill up around 10 pm, which is when we left.

City Bar was The Flamingo during the 80's.  It hasn't changed much, although the seating has been upgraded, the bar top re-done, and most importantly -- the bathrooms are much nicer!  The bar is in the basement and there are no windows, so it is dark and kind of dank.  

After the birthday party, we left behind a gift bottle of booze and a few cards.  Kevin had them for us later -- he set them aside for us to pick up.  I thought this was very impressive as a bottle of Grey Goose would probably just walk off in most bars.

We will return!"}
{"text":"I do like this bar, especially on Fridays from 3-10 when they serve $3 pitchers of PBR or Bud Light.  The low lighting and comfy couches and big booths lend to a laid-back atmosphere before 10 pm or so, but after that it becomes pretty much like any other college bar ever.  I also have to subtract a star for their bartenders--despite seeing me and my friends nearly every Friday before hockey games this semester, they still card us and make no attempts to show a hint of friendly recognition.  Overall, decent bar, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I always stop in here for a sex on the beach, they have the best although I never get service down here so I don't stay for long."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of buddies a couple of times and its quite nice. The booths, tables and such are pretty nice but then you get to the bar and its just a bit... well trashy if I dare say? It is nice but because it is an underground bar, it can get really loud really fast on a busy night. The bathrooms are hidden away in the back and its sort of small. It does have nice seating what with leather seats and such and has lots of TV's to watch all those games! Great drink specials and the bartenders have always been really nice. All-in-All and OK place to return to but not a place to become a regular at."}
{"text":"Your average kinda-dingy bar in a basement - not in a totally bad way though. This is a frequent stop for people in the department because it's not usually crawling with undergrads (though we once made the mistake of coming down here on a game day...never again) and the drinks are cheap and fairly strong. It's not the most attractive bar nor does it really have much ambiance but it's still a good place for a large group to meet up for drinks because it's easy (especially compared to other bars on State) to get a couple of tables together. They also serve your standard bar food, I am a particular fan of their fried cheese curds and other fried fare. Overall, a decent place to come get drinks with friends and not worry about it being too crowded or loud."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: just another loud college bar.

A few years back while I was at Madison we'd stop in to City Bar when we wanted to get away from (or more literally, under) the State Street craziness. I always found City Bar to be friendly and more laid-back, with slightly off-chart music choices and free popcorn. 

When I went back recently I found it to be just another drunk college place, with giant crowds and blaring music and no more popcorn. In fact, when I asked the very young bartender about the popcorn she gave me an almost disgusted look. 

Popcorn and music don't make or break a place, but the little things add up. I've found that City Bar no longer is the dive haven I remember it to be. Le sad.

Then again, going on a Saturday night was probably a poor choice anywhere around here."}
{"text":"+1: Mango infused vodka that is hard to find elsewhere
+1: (I forgot my ID and the bouncer let me in. I'm 6 years over the drinking age, but I look young)
+1: Lit up palm tree in the corner. Aaw, a little tribute to California in Wisconsin frigidness! 
+1: Lots of places to sit
-1: They turned off the jukebox, stealing my friend of her money and wisely picked songs. Lame!
+1: You never have to wait too long for a drink, even when crowded 
+1: the bartender knew how to make a Surfer on Acid shot in a snap.
-1: Very, very, very long walk to the bathroom which involves crossing the entire bar length if you are on the side with windows and then going up the stairs (if I remember correctly)

A girl ran up to me frantic and asked me for a piece of gum like she was looking for her last cigarette fix. The \"lit up\" bar looks totally cheesy and it's barely a gimmick at all. It's not even lit up that much, unless you count the dimly illuminated frosted blue glass on the counter. A decently fun place you can go to at graduate school age and not feel too old, especially when you are with a crowd. I commend my boyfriend for picking this place for his birthday. The look on the actual bouncer's face when my friend got drunk and was taking IDs at the door: priceless."}
{"text":"City Bar brings me back  2 - 3 years ago when I would attend college house/frat parties. This place definitely brings that vibe with college kids everywhere, top 40/rap music blaring, cheap drinks, sticky floors, and extremely crowded. 

Came in on a Saturday night with a group of people. A few people in the group wanted to come here, and I was down since I've never been. Walked down the steps and walked into the bar and squeezed our way to the bar. It took probably a good 15 minutes to actually get to the bar, grab the bartenders attention, order, and pay. Then it was trying to find a good place to stand where our big group wasn't in the way..which in all reality was no where. 

I don't think that I'll give this place another go, just not my scene, but like I said..probably would have loved this when I was 22 - 23!"}
{"text":"Interesting lounge type bar with a jukebox. Been here a few times. Not a bad place early on an evening if you want to actually hear people you're with. It seems pretty dead most of the times I've been there but I hear its actually a hopping place during the weekend."}
{"text":"Stopped here before Nebraska game. Great burger, great Bloody Mary, good prices & the bartender (didnt get her name but she's the one who mixed up the Bloody Mary mix) was outstanding."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews about this place, but I'm definitely a fan! I always have a great time here. Can definitely get pretty crowded, but, in my opinion, a bar is never fun unless it's crowded! This place is kind of tucked away, but definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Overtime, I have seem to take a liking to this bar. It's underground on State Street. It seems very chill and has a nice lounge atmosphere. It gets a little busy later at night and they always seem to have some great drink special when I'm there. Certainly somewhere I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Uh, it has a light up bar. Yeah, that's kind of neat."}
{"text":"Kinda of unique bar for Madison. Is dark and small yet still has a college vibe. Seems like most people end up here later in the night. 

If Brats is spilling out, go across the street to this interesting spot.  No cell service down below though."}
{"text":"City bar is okay - it's got an air of sketchiness to it - which may/may not be good if that's what you are looking for. 

- it's kind of like a bar slash lounge - that's underground."}
{"text":"This dark, basement bar is always a good place to run into that last guy you dated that you \"forgot\" to return his calls.....it never fails, I always feel like I know half the people here.  Overstuffed leather chairs and good, loud music are key.  The skyscraper drink is blue like windex...which frankly is unnatural....it's deadly though, watch out.  I'd chose Blue Velvet over this bar any day, but it's one of my faves.  Watch out though all you kids with fakes...the cops frequent this place as much as you do! 4 stars."}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot when I lived in Madison in my 20's. However was able to go back recently and have a martini and felt back at home. It was a Weekday but nonetheless was cozy and chill. Good times."}
{"text":"I'm not one for short reviews, but here we go:

Haven't eaten there, besides the wonderfully free popcorn, so I can't comment on the food. To me, City Bar = Nostalgia. We went there every Thursday after our painful Trusts and Estates class.

What's Thursday, you ask? Half price pitchers. Half price pitchers of damn good beer. Count me in, City. I will most definitely miss you.

P.S.: Don't go on weekends or at night...unless you're an undergrad. One and done for me in that regard."}
{"text":"Passion-fruit rum with orange juice, a bit of cream, and lemonade. Officially my new best friend.

Came here on a Sunday evening. Wasn't crowded. Wasn't loud. Some folks playing Mario Kart on one side of the room. Pretty chill place."}
{"text":"Great city burger. Good variety of tab beer. The manager is very nice. Remembers frequent visitors"}
{"text":"This is our favorite hide away bar since arriving in Madison. Chuck was the best bartender ever! Even after my girl started beat boxing...really she just said boots and cats really fast ten times"}
{"text":"The city has weak, overpriced drinks, an oftentimes shady crowd, slow bartenders and massive spillage everywhere.  The leather couches and chairs are this bar's only redeeming factors and there are about two dozen better places to grab a drink dowtown."}
{"text":"Went on a not crowded rainy Friday night.  We got pitchers and food and sat in the leather booths.  The beer selection is mediocre, although apparently they have good drinks with lots of color.  The food was pretty good - chips especially.  The atmosphere was fine and I made it to the bathroom with issue (but if you have a small bladder or can't read signs that point to the restroom then you apparently oughta try somewhere else).  They really should hire someone to paint a new mural - the current one is lame."}
{"text":"A sweet place tucked into State Street! The bartenders are always super friendly, and make great drinks (at reasonable prices I might add). My favorite bar so far."}
{"text":"City Bar is located in a dark basement. The food is, in general, not that great-- it's mostly frozen fried stuff. (One exception: The Friday fish fry special is surprisingly good). So why am I giving the City five stars? 

That's easy: the City has Kevin, the greatest bartender and hardest working man in Madison. I will very much miss spending time here."}
{"text":"Boy is this place cheap. Maybe I'm just not acclimated to Madison prices but $3 for that Karben4 IPA is incredible. Other than that, it's just sort of a divey college bar. BUt that seems totally appropriate given its location."}
{"text":"City Bar is a hidden gem underground from the rest of State Street. Literally. It's downstairs. The bar can be quite busy on given weekends with the student crowds, but on weeknights the atmosphere is great with plenty of big screen plasmas and a great menu for sandwiches, burgers and apps. Don't miss trivia nights or their nightly specials as dictated by the spinning wheel. You never know what will come up. Their martini list is extensive and they also make their own Strawberry (and sometimes other experimental) vodka - try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"City Bar has a great environment. It can get a bit claustrophobic on the crowded weekends and sometimes the bar specials aren't as good as other bars, but I love it anyway!"}
{"text":"THEY HAVE A PRIZE WHEEL FOR HOURLY SPECIALS!!!!!!!! Two drinks in and I was sold. I swear, the 11PM to 12AM spin was probably the most exciting thing I witnessed all evening. I know, life of the party right?

Pros:
- decent drinks
- updated playlist (with a few throwbacks)
- plenty of seating/standing room
- friendly and attentive bar service

Con:
- crowd was a little rowdy, too much pushing and shoving for me

We had:
1 cranberry vodka
1 gin and tonic
1 skittle bomb
2 applepie/cherry shots 

Grand total: $11.50

At $2/shot, that means the 3 drinks we had cost us just a little more than seven bucks total. WHAT. I had to up the tip. Otherwise, I'd just be ripping them off."}
{"text":"The only reason to go here is to get crunk off of the addictive strawberry infused vodka. Four stars for the vodka, minus 4 stars for the music/jukebox selection, plus two stars for the light up bar, and plus one star for the kind bouncer who once upon a time found my phone and wallet and didn't pillage either..."}
{"text":"I spent a lot of time at The City Bar while living in Downtown Madison.  It's by far one of the best spots in the area.  Always tons of action on the weekends.  Fun good looking young people dancing drinking - the way it should be on a college campus.  For the real old schoolers, this place used to be The Flamingo.  Tube Top Tuesdays.  Towers and Statesider.  Yeah great memories.  But this place is not only a fun bar, it also has THE BEST BAR FOOD IN ALL OF MADISON.  Get the Buffalo Bites appetizer.  They're incredible.  The homemade chips are sublime.  Crunchy and fresh, you won't want to ever stop eating them.  Also the burgers are really solid.  I'll definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in Madison.  Go Badgers!"}
{"text":"they have this drink called the \"skyscraper\".  we don't have skyscrapers in madison, so there you got your irony.  it should be called the \"sugar ditch\".  its koolaid with a splash of sugarbooze.  can be overrun with college kids, but when empty to half full its a great place to relax in nice chairs."}
{"text":"Well, this bar is down some stairs in a basement on State St. I remember when it was the Flamingo... great selection of beers. Nobody bothers me. This is a big plus. I like to drink alone, so not being bothered is key.  It's nice and dark (a good place for nursing a hangover, perhaps?:P), has an illuminated-from-underneath bar (it used to cycle through pretty colors till the motor broke, I hear) and also, they have food! I haven't actually eaten anything there yet, so I can't comment on it- looks like typical pub/college kid fare. Everything is really reasonably priced for being downtown. They also have trivia some nights and some inSANE drink specials (usually on a chalkboard sandwich thing out front). So cheap! I wish I could get a big group to meet me there some afternoon, and hang there till it's dark out. That would be cool."}
{"text":"Limited cell reception inside, but there free wifi!  (Ask for the password.)"}
{"text":"This bar is defintely for the college age crowd that likes to drink heavily and get really rowdy. It is a zoo after football games (when I went) and the crowd was way too obnoxious for me. I've heard that they infuse their own vodka which sounds pretty cool and I will definitely be back to try that....but probably earlier on in the evening...and probably not anytime near a football game!"}
{"text":"This bar is worth checking out and then never going again. It's a hole-in-the-wall and has free popcorn, but after that, loses its luster. Walk up State St. for a slightly more classy joint like Paul's Club after you see this dark and crowded underground bar."}
{"text":"A solid, solid A-OK.  The low's?  The low ceiling and altitude (it's a basement with no windows, which is totally reasonable during Madison's winter months).  The High's?  You can get high for pretty cheap during happy hour, which basically lasts until the undergrads show up... at which point you'll want to leave.  The food, once again, is A-OK; standard fare, best bet is to get a burger or something fried.  Truly, this little joint's approachability and a-proximity to campus are what make it a standby for graduate students, professors, and undergrads alike."}
{"text":"Wonderful bar. Haven't been here for food or trivia (hoping to make it) but seriously my go to bar in a last minute decision or if I'm on state Street! Kind of a mix between a college bar and a dive bar. No complaints!"}
