{"text":"Hidden gem!!  Incredible flavor and excellent service. Wish I lived here so I could go all the time. Try the Chicken Amazing (Amazing Chicken) you will not be disappointed. Spicy with a touch of sweetness."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was good. I can't complain about anything. The prices are very reasonable. I will certainly go back. The egg rolls were really good, as was the egg drop soup. The fried rice was good and it wasn't greasy which is a huge bonus!"}
{"text":"First time getting a food from here and I wasn't disappointed. Got enough food for three adult males and two ladies for under $60 delivered! Food was fantastic. The veggies were cooked perfectly and very fresh. Great job! Will be ordering from here for years to come. Thanks."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Wok Fire in Peoria! The manager knows me by name and remembers my order :) I get personalized service, they deliver and the best of all is they are extremely accommodating to allergen request which is amazing! They are my go to love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.
Inside is brand new and nicely lit.
They said they are adding to the menu.

Signature Dishes Include for Chicken Include:
Teriyaki
Orange Chicken
Indian Curry
Black Pepper"}
{"text":"This is one of our new favorite restaurants. The food is fresh and delicious! The owners and workers are so friendly and remember us every time we come in. I am a vegetarian and they are helpful to point out dishes that I would enjoy. I have not had a single thing that was not delicious! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner at Wok Fire the other evening. Family-run establishment and the children took our order , totally by memory not writing it down.The food was well above average. As we sat and dined in the very casual and small dining room we counted perhaps ten to-go orders. Good food, good prices, and enthusiastic staff. This was a great find."}
{"text":"This probably the best chinese restaurant near Sun City. The coconut shrimp taste delicious. The egg rolls and fried rice is made to order, very tasty. Try it you'll like it. Just like chinese food back east."}
{"text":"Received the Wok Fire menu in our mailbox and decided to give it a try. Great location near 91st avenue and Bell rd. Very friendly family business. Ordered the Orange chicken combination meal that came with your choice of white, brown,or fried rice and an egg roll. There was a good amount of tasty orange sauce on the crispy chicken. Our other entree was a house specialty called Amazing chicken with white rice. The sauce was sweet and finished with just a little spicy heat. Portion size was huge and included mixed vegetables. All of it was perfectly cooked. We also tried the Fire puffs (cream cheese wontons) and Chinese donuts. DELICIOUS! We will definitely be going back. And yes we had plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"This is Chinese...?? Absolutely NO flavor. Every dish, from the sesame chicken to the lo mein and crab puffs was bland. Very nice people but would not spend my $$ here again. P.S. The take out containers are better than the food, sadly."}
{"text":"Good food and timely delivery makes this a winner!   Coconut shrimp was amazing.  We also had the beef w snow peas and mushrooms and cashew chicken.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They deliver promptly and accept late orders. Customer service is fantastic, one of the employees memorized my order and always greets very well. The food is delicious and fresh. I usually order orange chicken, fried rice, and lo mein, and it is perfect. I then went into the place to pick up my order, there were plenty of people inside. Today, i decided to take my family and eat in the restaurant, customer service, food, and overall the restaurant was very very clean."}
{"text":"Hmmmm- I read reviews first then went over. A 2 is being nice... my wife's chicken was slightly raw and my orange chicken was tough and simply awful. The Won Ton soup was good, the fountain drinks was good but the rest - disappointing."}
{"text":"The one star is because the staff was very nice. The food was by far the worst. Microwaveable teriyaki bowls you can get next door at albertsons are even better. The spice needed spice, the sauce was watered down, the won tons were super greasy. I didn't finish but maybe a 4th of my food when I decided being hungry was better than eating this. The place is new, clean, nicely lit, great staff, just TERRIBLE TERRIBLE food. I never write reviews but the food was so bad I had to. Thankfully the soup we got was free cause that was gross too. Sorry but this place is NOT worth going to."}
{"text":"Looking for a close to real fast Chinese freshly cooked not on a steam line, this is the place! 
Order Kung Pao And Teriyaki with hot and sour soup.
Flavors are delicious. 
Can't wait to come back and try other dishes on their menu, service was really good and friendly, place just need to be more clean in the sitting area. 
Overall, happy with food."}
{"text":"Family ran business. The kids talk as if they are family. The sweet and sour is sweet which I like. The Fire Puffs were my favorite. The egg drop soup was egg paste but I don't like that crap anyways"}
{"text":"The wonton soup had no flavor. The noodles were soggy and the orange chicken was soggy as well. I paid way too much money for my meal. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Was really good. We had the make your own noodles and the chicken teriyaki rice bowl and both were solid. I had Shanghai Noodles, Steak, and Mongolian Sauce which I will definitely do again. Coworker said the teriyaki bowl was one of the best she has had.

We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Place was busy! Food was great! I was amazed how much shrimp I got in my noodle bowl! The veggies still had life to them and didn't get lost in the noodles. New items are being added so I snapped a pic."}
{"text":"Bento box was blah. Chicken was not right looked like parts unknown. Rice wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"Got some take-out from Wok Fire today. This was my \"I Didn't Win The Powerball\" consolation lunch. Sadly, I was not impressed at all. The meal was as bad as my lottery number selections. I can't rate the atmosphere because my coworker picked up the order, but it was all the information I needed to know I will never Check In here.

I ordered the Create Your Own Noodle Bowl. I got Hong Kong noodles with chicken in Indian Curry sauce and my husband got Hong Kong noodles with chicken in Mongolian sauce. We both got egg rolls. The noodles were fine and the sauces were \"meh\", but the chicken was absolutely awful. Stringy, sinewy, dark pieces of third-world country \"meat\" sauteed in an oily bowl with some squishy veggies. I only ate half of it but it felt like I ate a brick for lunch! Then half an hour later I felt sick to my stomach. Not that the food was bad as in rotten. It was just bad as in yucky and the body wanted to reject it.

I really hate to write a review like this because I love dining out and I love trying new places, but this meal turned me against Chinese food for a while."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! We just moved here from NYC- we are pretty snobby about any Asian cuisine- THIS PLACE ROCKS. When we moved in a month ago; we got delivery and were happy. Did it again tonight- just as good. I had steak with ribbon noodles in  the Mongolian spicy and WOW. Hubby got shrimp and pork fried rice. This place knows how to cook and deliver. 20 mins amd we had our awesome food. Thanks guys- u have us hooked!"}
{"text":"Food always fast and fresh the chicken wings are addicting as hell. Hands down best Chinese food I've had."}
{"text":"It's my new favorite place ever. Everything is so good. Mongolian steak ,orange chicken. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, good prices, convenient location with a Spartan dining area, this restaurant is almost ideal.
The Wok Fire is located in the corner of an Albertsons strip mall with plenty of easy parking. The ample parking and the meager dining area make take outs preferable to eating in for me. They also deliver within a six mile radius for next to nothing. The trade-off is that this delivery can take up to 45 minutes from the time you place your order. 
The online (http://www.wokfirepeoria.com/) menu is a little awkward to use. An online .pdf version of their store menu would be useful for their web site. Call in orders can be ready within five minutes.
I have ordered the following items: 
Beef fried rice (called beef wok fire rice)  -  8/10  -  $6.99
New York egg role (pork) - 10/10 - $1.35
Shrimp egg role - 10/10 - $1.55
chicken chow mein - 9/10 - $8.25"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food in town,the young lady there was very nice and it was a family business.I ordered the orange chicken and it was SOOO good.I will definitely be back.the prices were really nice and affordable.You can get the lunch special which is before 3:00 and the order will come with a drink soup or egg roll,GREAT DEAl!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst, no, it IS the worst Chinese food we have ever had.  The young man at the counter was very nice, but other than that, this place is a disaster. The Hot and Sour soup was watered down and tasted of Orajel, the rice had absolutely no flavor to it, the Fire Puffs were filled with a gelatinous blob of what tasted of cream cheese, sugar, and carrots. The sweet and sour sauce tasted like pure bubble gum and the chicken for it was mashed chicken fried in batter. The orange chicken was not orange chicken at all and would have been better branded as the way too much garlic chicken. Out of 6 people at least 4 of us got sick within 20 minutes of eating there. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy. 
If you need to puke, this is a place to go! 
I would give it 0 stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"Normally good food but the last 2 times have been disappointing. But this time I ordered my food in person. Got all the way home only to have someone else's order. Went back to the store. Not a problem. Driving home again. Guess what they gave me the wrong order again! At least this time I didn't get all the way home. Third time order was right. However food was cold. After I specifically said I wanted them to remake the entire order. Gave two stars because I've experienced good times however the last 2 have been upsetting. I will just never come back. Despite it all the young man at the counter was nice."}
{"text":"We decided to try a to go order from this new place. It was okay but for the price probably won't order from here again. Prices are not bad just the food was not that great. Not terrible but just okay. We ordered a teriyaki chicken udon bowl, chicken fried rice, and hot and sour soup. Just not that flavorful."}
{"text":"Very good spicy pepper chicken ... will return .not often I can say that about a Chinese place !!! Love it"}
{"text":"Decent place to have Asian food. Order broccoli and shrimp lunch dish. Very nicely priced. Tasted pretty good, a little heavy on the sauce tho. I did however really enjoy the rice. It tasted very very fresh. I could tell it was fresh because they used the same rice that I buy myself and I could tell it was freshly cooked just like at home when I freshly cook it. The menu was very easy to look and decide what I wanted. Nice lunch menu and prices also."}
{"text":"This place was pretty underwhelming. Their food was pretty bland and nothing stood out with much flavor. Everything was just subpar. The people were nice and they had a lot of items on the menu but I can't really say the food was good. You can dine in or take your food to go. It doesn't take very long for them to make your food. Everything was nice and clean. I looks like they keep up with the cleaning which is really nice.

The place was easy to find and there was a lot of parking.  I liked the sign outside of the restaurant. The name really stood out from the other shops around.

I am not sure how this place as an average of 4 stars. Looking at the more resent reviews it looks like others didn't particularly like the food here either. Next time I will make sure to read some of the latest reviews first before deciding on a new place based off of the overall rating.

I would say everyone should skip this place and try something else."}
{"text":"Small and simple place. Very clean and proprietors are friendly.  Order at the counter and they bring everything over to you. I ordered the Orange Chicken. A good sized dish cooked very well with a spicy sweet sauce. What I loved about this dish is that the coating around the chicken was light. None of the three other Chinese restaurants can match that. All white meat chicken. I will go back again. It got 4 stars because the it is not a full sit down restaurant. 

I am from NY and they have a NY style egg roll. It is a larger egg roll and pretty good."}
{"text":"Very typical store front Chinese restaurant.  A few tables, but take out seemed to be key business.  I was there on a Wednesday evening at 5:30 PM and place was not too busy.

Food wise, it is a safe simple bet for americanized Chinese food.  No real tries at making items traditional or extra seasoned.

We will try again and encourage the chef to 'kick it up a notch' .  Note I did find out when we ordered a noodle dish that we could choose the noodle type, we picked Chow fun (wider noodles).

Nothing turned us off, but nothing wow'ed us.  We will give it a second try.

Seems family run and that is a plus for us."}
{"text":"Great little Chinese restaurant. Food is fresh and tasty. I would eat here a couple of times a week. Menu prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is great. I do not live in this area anymore but whenever I'm around I make sure I pick up food to go. My family really enjoy it. Its cooked to order and the prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews, I thought it would be worth a try. Called to make a pick up order and the person on the phone was incredibly rude.  

Her attitude alone made me change my mind and order from some place else. 

Tip for management or owner:  Wondering why you are not gaining new customers?  It's the lack of customer service your employees are providing."}
{"text":"The favors were bland and greasy. We ordered the \"fun\" noodle dish, chicken wings, and cheese wontons, fried rice with beef and fried rice with chicken, sesame chicken, general tso shrimp, and Mongolian beef. The beef in the mongo was tough and bland, the onions and bell peppers in it were descent. The sesame chicken was ok, nothing special about it. The delivery was about 40 minutes and it was pretty expensive it was about $80. This was our second time ordering and I definitely won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Love the food. And it reminds me of a place back home. Family owned friendly fast and ok so wonderful food."}
{"text":"In a word...bland. Boring, flavorless food. Was very disappointed since there were some positive reviews, but I tasted nothing. Was a chore to finish my meal."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for takeout since they opened about 2 years ago. The customer service is always amazing, they go above & beyond to take care of everyone. Our favorites are the Moo goo gai pan, sesame chicken, Moo shu & the General Tso's. Their prices are reasonable but lunch is even a better deal!"}
{"text":"I've Been Looking For a Good Rice Bowl, That's Not Too Pricey and Witb Fresh Veggies. This One Is Decent... My Only Wish Is There Was a Little More In The Bowl For $5.99."}
{"text":"Bae took me and got me his usual which is the curry noodle (or Singapore stir fry noodle). The flavor is Definitely there and spicy too! You can't find the perfect Singapore stir fry noodles anywhere but this place definitely nailed it."}
{"text":"More like a 4.3 the food had great flavor!!! The portion were made for two not just one... you can get a feast for 50$. Only thing I would say I didn't like was how warm it got inside. I will order take out next."}
{"text":"Good food for cheap, can make a custom bowl which id pretty nice. Small she looks family owned."}
{"text":"I go here once a week if you like Chinese 
You'll love it! Usually I get chop suey. There rice is perfect even if your using 
Chop sticks. Fast and delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I have been there once since it opened and definitely plan to be back soon. 

I have been back several times since my first visit and have been really happy each time. The food is excellent, service is top notch, and I really like how they offer substitutions for the lunch (drink, soup, or egg roll)."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out here a few times.  The food is authentic, flavorful and actually the best Chinese take out in the vicinity.  The House wonton soup is spot on, a lot of vegetables, Shrimp and wontons.  We also ordered the egg fu young both vegetable and pork version it is terrific!  The spring rolls are crisp and light. Asian family owned business, it can't get anymore authentic."}
{"text":"It was yummy! The service was amazing and there was plenty of food. There was 5 of us we spent 60$ and there was more then enough to feed one or two more... It was fresh..quick and filling!"}
{"text":"I note at the time of this review this is a NEWLY OPENED restaurant and they might still be tweaking things.

This is a small casual family friendly restaurant where you order at the counter, seat yourself and pick up your order when it's ready.

The Specialty of the house are the Noodle Bowls where you have FIVE choices, then you decide on your vegetables, meat, and FIVE sauces to pick from. They also offer other items like a few appetizers, salads, rice bowls, bento boxes and FIVE signature dishes.

Get ready to eat with either chop sticks or a small plastic SPORK.

I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken with Hong Kong Noodles. The chicken in my dish was very good. It was moist and tender. I also liked that it was a combination of white and dark meat. The very thin but tasty Hong Kong Noodles where prepared well and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. I am not entirely sure that they gave me my bowl with the Pad Thai sauce because it didn't taste like Pad Thai at all and tasted more like spicy very SWEET and sour. It also lacked the peanuts it had in the description. The choices of sauces are Pad Thai with peanuts, Mongolian, Indian Curry and House. If mine was Pad Thai I recommend any other flavor instead. Unless you like spicy that's sweet like pancake syrup.

My husband had the Steak Noodle Bowl with Chewy Shanghai Noodles and House Sauce that you can order Spicy. The house sauce was described as a kung pao kind of sauce. His meal WAS MUCH BETTER than mine because the sauce was much better. 

Wok Fire is located in the Shopping center that's surrounded by all the car dealers on Bell Road in Peoria.

It's a family friendly kind of place and offers a few Children's Meals. Prices are also low.

 Got some potential going on here."}
{"text":"I have been ordering take out from this restaurant since they opened. The employees are very pleasant and have never gotten my order wrong and are always on time. Only critique I have is sometimes the noodles can be a little too soft, making them mushy. But it's only happened a couple times and it hasn't stopped me from continuing to order from them!"}
{"text":"Really delicious become my 1 place to go everyday after I pick my child up from school.I definitely recommend this place .If you want a free drink you should come before 3 o'clock .The staffs are really nice too,they remembered my name."}
{"text":"Great first impression. Friendly and fast, generous portions, quality ingredients...definitely off to a good start. I tried the fire puffs and orange chicken. Puffs were good, I can't believe I'm saying this because it's usually the opposite but I think they could go a bit lighter on the filling. Filling is super flavorful and very creamy but almost too sweet and I think it was because of how much there was. I took some out and it was perfect! 
I can't honestly say it's the best Orange chicken I've ever had but it was good. Chicken itself was great with large pieces  of white meat and veggies were cooked perfectly and not drowning under sauce. The chicken pieces were almost too large - I had to cut one piece into 12 bites! The sauce was ok but along the same lines as puffs, it was too sweet. It has good flavor but it is just way sweeter than I prefer. 
I will definitely be back to try other items because you can tell the quality is there with their food. Funny enough, the rice was my favorite and that's a good thing because I am really picky about rice. Rice was cooked perfectly and helped level out the sweetness of the Orange chicken. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend Wok Fire. I've been looking for a place to get shrimp with steamed veggies and rice and after my trial run tonight I am definitely comfortable going back and trying the shrimp!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I go here all the time. Their orange chicken and spring rolls cannot be beat, staff is very friendly and they deliver! I hope they stay around a long long time!"}
{"text":"The wife and I both got the make your own noodle bowl, I got the pad Thai sauce she got the Teriyaki sauce. I asked for mine extra spicy and it was like a 3 out of ten for spice. Very few veggies and pretty boring flavors rounded out a pretty \"vanilla\" meal. 

It's a huge pet peave of mine when restaurants are afraid to make things too spicy or too anything for that matter. If I order something that's supposed to be spicy it needs to actually be spicy! 

It wasn't a bad meal, but definitely will not come back, very underwhelming."}
{"text":"my first visit had two black strands of hair in it. My second visit had one strand of black hair in my egg roll. There won't be a third visit. Also found the lobby to be dirty and the food bland. Many other better choices"}
{"text":"Came here unplanned to substitute my regular Chinese place. A typical fast food American Chinese place next to Albertsons. Quick and friendly service. Ordered chicken mixed vegetables in regular size. Pretty decent taste and portion. Will give this place another visit in the future."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting! The soup tastes like poison. The chow mein was so bland and you get the smallest bowl of it for $10. There was a sticker still on one of the cut up peppers. It was a huge waste of money. Sadly I can't believe they are still in business. I am used to eating abacus or ginger bistro and wok fire does not even compare in the least. It's like comparing a diamond to a fart!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Everything was right to order and they even gave me a couple extra spring rolls. Would give more stars if possible."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place going in, and we ordered to go. It was ready fast and we got the noodle bowls- one steak with house sauce and one chicken with teriyaki. My boyfriend's steak one was good he said; but mine was not as good because the teriyaki was greasy and the chicken tasted not real and like McDonald's quality. Then, I ordered Spring rolls and we ended up with a side of edamame instead... So that's why the 3 stars and not 2, because the steak one was good."}
{"text":"Wok Fire was a happy little surprise to find tucked away in a languishing strip mall overshadowed by the car dealerships on either side. When they first opened, they were really focused on the \"build your own noodle bowl\" side of the business, and that never really drew me in.

Some months later, they seemed to start advertising as a more traditional Asian restaurant and they also added online ordering and delivery, so one lazy night I just had to try it. 

Their NY style Chinese food is so good. Best egg rolls I've ever had in AZ, hands down. I really dig their fried rice as well, but in my family our favorite Wok Fire dishes are the egg fu yung and the moo shoo. 

The food here is really traditional, but with less grease and MSG than a lot of Chinese food restaurants. (I think the other reviewers complaining about bland food must prefer theirs with extra fat and salt.) You can actually taste the herbs, spices and meats (all white meat chicken!) here. The vegetables are always super fresh and never over-cooked. 

I've never had a bad dish from this place. Even the stuff that isn't my favorite was still ok. I didn't think the extremely crowded Asian food corridor on 91st Ave between Bell and Union Hills needed any more competition, but Wok Fire has officially taken my regular business away from one of their nearby competitors!"}
{"text":"Fast , Fresh and Good Flavor :)
We will definitely be calling for Delivery again.

Very happy with the communication to get the order. 
They called me back so no mix-ups."}
{"text":"D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!!!!!!!!!!! I got the Honey Chicken (not on the menu) & Icon Noodles w. Beef.... I will spend my money here everyday if I could......My pic won't post, but just so you know....It's an empty plate.....OMG"}
{"text":"Wanted take out so decided to try this place, I love how it is family owned and the food is DELICIOUS. Would definitely come back! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I ordered the vegetable chow fun (I'm vegetarian) and they gave me chicken chow fun :("}
{"text":"We ordered through Eat24. I love that I can track the delivery time.

Anyway, this was some mighty delicious food! It was flavorful and the packaging was so nice. We ordered the orange chicken and sesame chicken dinners. They both came with an egg roll and sweet &a sour sauce. We ordered some gyoza too since that's all our 4 year old eats and he devoured it. He then went on to eat the remaining of my sesame chicken. When my 4 yr old thinks it's delicious than it's delicious ! Great service, great food, definitely ordered through here again!"}
{"text":"wok fire has some good orange chicken had it from this location twice both time it was speedy fast and super bomb!"}
{"text":"Love their fast delivery!! Food is yummy and pretty good. :)  you gotta try their delivery service, I don't even have to get up to get my wallet!"}
{"text":"We finally found our \"go to\" place for Chinese food!! Food was incredible and portions generous."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is great, the staff is incredible and ALWAYS nice and accommodating. We carry out from here often and have NEVER had an off meal. I definitely recommend you check it out, I'm sure you'll come back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm from Jersey and I've struggled for the last two years to find authentic NJ Chinese food. So glad I found wok fire because the food is amazing! They've got duck sauce (so you know it's trustworthy)! I've had shrimp with broccoli, friend rice, wings, Kung pao beef, and egg rolls! I've yet to be disappointed eating here. I highly recommend it especially for east coast transplants!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new restaurant go in close to home. I tried it out after a late morning hike. Parched, I asked for a cup of water, they only had bottled water. I declined, however they insisted...on the house, saying they are getting a fountain machine soon. That was a very kind gesture! I got the Bento Box with Orange chicken, enough for 2 meals! However, I ended up eating it all in one sitting. Everyone in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery multiple times and take out once. Delivery takes a little while even being 1 mile from the restaurant, not a huge deal. Take out took forever calling 20 minutes ahead of time. Regardless the food is great for a fast Chinese restaurant, and definitely fresh."}
{"text":"Really good place for lunch great deal and perfect amount of food. I would recommend the general tsos chicken some spice tossed with vegetables."}
{"text":"Worst food ever, had delivered and got the wrong food, everything was cold and gross, never go there again!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean family restaurant. Food is fresh and hot.  Hot and sour soup and spring rolls great.  Nice place for lunch. Will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the hot and sour soup and was really disappointed, however, the other items we got were quite good. The egg rolls were excellent. I'm from NYC and particular about my Chinese Food."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week if not more.  The fried rice is about as good as you can get, and the coconut shrimp is the wife's fav.   I love the Gen Tso' Chicken.  (It is a Very nice representation.)  However, the food is on average good to better than average for the most part, (I cannot lie)  But it is the delivery that makes this worth the go for us.  If you are sick of delivery consisting only of pizza and pasta, it is nice to get a healthy choice on those days you just can't bring yourself to cook, or you are too lazy to get your ass out of the house.   ;-)"}
{"text":"I compare this restaurant to Chinese restaurant at the mall. We ordered the Sesame Chicken and Chicken Egg Foo Young. Both very bland. Sesame chicken was dry and tough with large chunks of under cooked broccoli and slices of carrots. Egg Foo Young was just as bland. Three large patties with large chunks of onion as filler. No vegetables just patties and near tasteless substance that passed off as gravy. 
Hot & Sour soup was somewhat better than normal but lacking in tofu. 

Save your money"}
{"text":"Really great little place. Like a generic Panda Express but taste better. It's cool to see the family all working in the back to make this place run. They are living the American dream. They sure do take a long time to push out your order tho, but I guess that just means they put extra love in the food."}
{"text":"Not so good.  Taste like fast food Chinese.  Hot n Sour soup worst I've ever had.  Not much flavor in the Kung pao chicken.  Friendly but not so good.  Can not recommend."}
{"text":"I was craving noodles really bad one day. I liked that this place had the option to create your own noodles. It all sounded so good to me at the moment! So I just had to come in and check it out. 

I ordered the Shanghai noodles with chicken & house sauce. I also ordered a side of egg drop soup. The prices are great here. Especially since the portion sizes are pretty big. But these noodles were soooooo bland. I was so disappointed. I tried to save the noodles by adding a little bit of soy sauce but nothing seemed to help. It literally tasted like a teaspoon of soy sauce, water, corn starch & jarred minced garlic. The garlic was a little overwhelming since that's basically the only thing I could really taste. & To top it off, the egg drop soup was even very bland. 

Overall, the portion sizes & prices are great here. Service is quick but the lady at the register was really pushy and didn't give me much time to look at the menu without suggesting what I should order. As far as tastes goes, it's disappointing & bland. I would consider trying this place again with a different sauce next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim & i regret not just going to Panda. Sure, it's cheap for the portion, but the fried rice was mush & had no taste. The egg roll was ok but kind of like rubber. Ordered online and showed up a lil early than the given time & my food was actually a lil cold. Gave it a try & hey, its right next to Goodcents, go there instead"}
{"text":"I give them FIVE stars for FRESHNESS! The ingredients are good quality and extremely fresh!! I LOVE that they include WHITE meat in their dishes at no extra charge!! You can tell they take pride in their food because of the level of freshness and how PERFECTLY prepared the food is!!! They also pack their food to go with major care that I have not seen by other restaurants. 

I will admit that some dishes could use a little more flavor, but that is because I like super bold flavors. Not everyone else does, so it might just be a select few who feel it could use more flavor. This place does a good business, so people obviously enjoy their food!!

I actually order my dishes spicy, no matter what I order, and the flavor is BIG and BOLD, but NOT crazy spicy. If you like a bit of spice, you will certainly enjoy!!

I LOVE their house wonton soup!!! Seriously, you just can't get fresher ingredients!! I am passing up THREE Chinese restaurants all located on 91st Avenue and Union Hills to get my \"war\" (they call it \"house\") wonton soup fix!! That is all I am ordering today because I am eating light today to make up for being bad lately. I'll be back for a bigger order soon!! With that said, I have to admit I think their egg drop soup is boring, so don't judge them by the egg drop soup!"}
{"text":"I order through the eat 24 app through Yelp and I must say since being in Arizona originally from New York it's the closest thing to NY Chinese food. It's delicious in everyway, not only that but they're also fast with deliveries so that's a plus!!"}
{"text":"Updating to 5 stars since Wok Fire always delivers and exceeds expectations! Also, best shrimp fried rice I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Service great. Food out quickly. Restrooms clean. 9 tables. Orangeish theme walls upholstery and lamps. One problem - chicken tasted leftover. Kyu not eating her chicken. She says it tastes boiled. Cost the restaurant 2 stars."}
{"text":"Don't pass by this unassuming mom and pop  lil cafe, soups are ok had egg drop as well as wonton, the real star is the wok fired rice, the veggie is good but the chicken version is epic.  Very good shrimp with black bean sauce, and nice version of mushrooms with snow peas."}
{"text":"good Chinese food. I have order them for delivery and take out and have not been disappointed. Good portions and noodle bowl are awesome"}
{"text":"The food was ok, not great. When i asked about the veggie chow me in they described it very different than it arrived."}
{"text":"Glad to have a found a good rated Asian cuisine in the Peoria area. The prices were very competitive and were priced on the cheaper end. 

But the food was definitely not up to par. Every dish we ordered was probably a 1 or 2 / 5. 

Very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this place is new and I'm sure will do fantastic. Staff was very friendly and accommodating food was hot and fresh. I would give five stars if they improved their salad dressing the texture was very grainy and chunky which was the only draw back the flavor was great! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Moved to the area recently and am looking for a decent Chinese take out. Unfortunately this isn't it. Most of a variety of dishes we tried were pretty tasteless and bland. The sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken had absolutely no taste. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is really good, I usually get the create your own noodle bowl, egg rolls and some sort of chicken like orange or the coconut chicken. I try something new every time and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Food was above average and at a very decent price. We have tried several Asian restaurants around the area and so far it is one of the best that we have found for the speed, price and quality of the food."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!! Great service! Their soups are always fresh and delicious! And their veggie spring rolls are amazing!! I am glad they're in Peoria"}
{"text":"Always fresh, delicious food. We usually order for the whole family and I don't have to fight my kids to eat this food.the sesame shrimp is out of this world. My only slight complaint is the vegetables are basically still raw when you get them, and with braces, I cannot eat them until they're soft. Still, I'm never dissatisfied. 
We also love the crab puffs, egg drop soup, sweet and sour pork and sesame chicken. 5/5 would eat again."}
{"text":"Good meal, great prices. Lobby gets a little warm from outside sun and possibly the kitchen. Be a good idea to add bamboo shades or tint of some sort to the lobby windows to help keep lobby shaded and cool. Or open door to allow for air flow. Otherwise, great place. Amazing friendly service!!! Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, they have all the items you would ever want from a neighborhood spot. Everything we have tried has been super fresh and tasted great. They deliver too which is great! Try the jumbo shrimp with Veggies"}
{"text":"FRESH food, huge portions!  We used to live within walking distance so don't get it as often, but this place is a GEM!  I always leave a tip because it's a family-owned business, the only one in Arizona, and they have their children working; waiting tables and taking orders so that alone deserves Kudos for great parenting."}
