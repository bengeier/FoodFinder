{"text":"this place makes me feel like home.  BIG PORTIONS! just look at my order with my girlfriend. I had to Polish off the rest of her 75% that she didn't eat. I'm full, satisfied, and stuffed to the point where my food spews out of my nose! sorry TMI but worth it, good food, great quality and people!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Ajax area by far. Portions are huge, food is good and the price is right. It's small and there's almost always a wait, but its usually not too long. Service is quick and friendly. This restaurant doesn't show up in a Yelp search for \"breakfast\"??"}
{"text":"Very good and fast service.  The servings are soooo big that you need a doggy bag.  If you ask, they will cater to vegetarians and vegans."}
{"text":"Ive been to angeliques a couple times, it was great both times. The first time i had to wait to get a table but it didnt take too long, we were third in line. That was really the only downside. The coffee is better than most breakfast places, and the portions are huge. Two orders of bacon and eggs and one cup of coffee will run you $16 before 11."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and felt the need to tack on to the plethora of positive reviews.  Most recently had the steak benedict which was fantastic. The portions in general are large and the service is speedy and pleasant.  Lines are long on weekends but worth waiting for as no other spot in the area is quite as good."}
{"text":"Great little place   went in the other day and  look great  didnt try  the food yet  but gonna try soon...."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for breakfast on weekends.  My husband always orders the eggs benny. He claims that they are the best around. The atmosphere is lively as its a small place and its always packed. the decor is eclectic and cozy.  We love restaurants where you can bring your kids and not worry about the noise level and them disturbing other patrons.  I usually get the steak sandwich.  Its always prepared fresh and the steak done to my specifications.  Portions are huge.  Even my kids can split a kids meal and still leave full.  Great wait staff make this place a keeper.  The secret is out however.  This place is always packed especially on a weekend for breakfast and lunch.  If you do go on a weekend,  prepare to wait in a line up out the door.  That says a lot about how much people like this place."}
{"text":"Generous portions accompanied by amazing taste. Ordered the combination breakfast ($10.95) and extra large combination breakfast ($13.95) with plenty of leftovers to take home. Definitely by far our favourite breakfast restaurant - coming from a breakfast kind of family.  Service is also quite friendly.  Limited seating and always packed - be sure to arrive at a decent time!"}
{"text":"We arrived 12pm on a Sunday and waited about 15mins for a table. Food came 5mins after ordering. The 3eggs breakfast with peameal bacon is a steal at $8.25 in my mind. The portion are very generous. The reg bacon looks good too, there are good size strip of meat on it and not just fat, very crispy too. Overall a very good place for breakfast / family lunch. Highly recommended if ur in the Ajax area."}
{"text":"Service is efficient and food is hot and delicious!  It's a quaint little joint with mismatched utensils and plates, that just adds to the hominess.  Have been here multiple times and have not been disappointed, the Angelique's breakfast sandwich is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Comfort food. My favorite breakfast spot. Friendly, attentive wait staff. Bottomless coffee and simple eggs and bacon are the best. Very generous portions too. Really good pancakes. This place is a hotspot, so expect a lineup on the weekends."}
{"text":"Really really disappointed with my experience. I was charged $1.50 extra to add mayo to a bacon egg and cheese sandwich. The waitress said she had to charge extra as mayo didnt go with that sandwich. I had  been many times before and raved about the place. The pettiness and surcharge really turned me off. I doubt I'll go back. All over a dollar fifty. As a customer I expect better ."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions (ordered Western omelette). Great price. Great service. Great menu options. Homey atmosphere. Also loved the fact that  even though the place was crowded it didn't take long to be seated.  Definitely going  back!"}
{"text":"Great location for home style food.  The quality of the food is amazing. Not only are u there to get good service but the social atmosphere is great too."}
{"text":"My first time there after reading some great reviews and they are true. Fast, friendly service and the variety on the menu was very impressive. I ordered 3 eggs with sausages and home fries and they gave me 4 eggs and everything was perfect. Boy I know I will be back again and will recommend this place for breakfast to anyone. BTW I couldn't finish everything so took the leftovers home."}
{"text":"This is the place to come when you're starving. Breakfast is always perfect and truly home made. Lunch options are huge. Burgers are 6\" in diameter and weigh around a pound. They are greasy and impossible to finish but truly wonderful. Wraps are fresh and sides are huge."}
{"text":"What a great surprise going to Angelique's. My family and I went there for breakfast and I was blown away. The food was insanely delicious. The portions were huge! Overall, a great place to go."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal there yet amazing portions closest thing to home made food in a restaurant wonderful family run business great staff can't say enough good things about this place I miss it very much since I moved to the Belleville area"}
{"text":"Despite all of the great reviews of this place, I unfortunately cannot give them a good review for one simple reason:  eggs...barely...cooked.  Both my Wife and I had the breakfast special and asked for the eggs over MEDIUM.  I even stressed \"not too runny\"  Well, not only were the yolks uncooked, but most of the egg white was runny and gluey - GROSS.  In my opinion, if you cannot follow orders on how the customer wants their eggs cooked, you are not worthy of a return visit.  Too bad, having to line up had my hopes up.   Never again."}
{"text":"Real hidden neighborhood GEM Great spot for Breakfast. Excellent dishes with large serving sizes. Great and efficient serving staff. If you go on the weekends, go early and expect a line-up.  -Callahan-"}
{"text":"Although this is my second time here, I've come to believe that this place cannot disappoint.  I'm a huge eggs benny fan so usually, I'll try out their traditional before I \"venture out\", if I dare.  I'm glad I did because the it was unbelievable.  Philly Cheesesteak Eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious.  Although the portion was very generous, I finished the entire thing.  It came with very tender strips of beef with delicious onions, green peppers and mushrooms.  This was then topped with perfectly poached eggs and their delicious hollandaise sauce. The dish looked absolutely amazing that a woman in line came up to our table and asked what I was eating.  After my brief review, she was sold. No doubt she enjoyed it as much as I did. 5/5.  Fries - My favourite kind of fries are fresh handout fries.  Just looking at their fries (and eventually trying them), only makes me dream of what their poutine would be like.  5/5.  Clubhouse Sandwich - Very generous with their meats that also had a lot of flavour.  Sometimes the deli meats are pretty bland and are lacking but theirs is quite good. 5/5."}
{"text":"Went to Angeliques on Sunday and ordered eggs Florentine. I forgot to tell the waitress that I was allergic to hollandaise sauce.  Silly me. So when the dish came I explained this to the waitress and she was so great she took it away with no hesitation and had it remade for me.  Talk about fantastic service!  And it was also yummy. But this waitress who ironically was called Angela was super fast nice and efficient . I will definetly be back soon."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the GTA!  This place is always bustling because of the fast, friendly service and mammoth portions (for a great price)."}
{"text":"The food portion are huge, the food tastes good, the prices are good, and the staff is great. HOWEVER the fat content is over the top and extremely high in calories."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the area, hands down! The portions are massive! Shredded potatoes are always excellent, the peameal/cheddar/egg sandwich is always my go to."}
{"text":"Highly rated breakfast place in Durham and it lives up to its rating! The atmosphere is authentic to any old-school breakfast diner with many seats inside. It is always packed because of how well it is known in ajax.  I ordered the big breakfast which comes with sausage, bacon, peameal eggs, pancakes and hash browns. The shredded hashbrowns are great but you should try half and half, where it comes with shredded hash and home fries. The food came out fast considering how busy it was at the restaurant. The plates are large portions for a reasonable price The service is friendly and I liked our server. The tips go straight to the server."}
{"text":"I've been here many times since moving to the area 2 years ago.  Easily the best breakfast place in Durham.  There is a lineup on the weekend, but nothing longer then 15 mins and it's definately worth it.  Despite it being packed everytime I've been there, service has always been excellent and the food always quick & delish.  American quantities!!!"}
{"text":"I frankly don't understand why I ever go anywhere else for breakfast when it's open. Everything is home-cook style, delicious, huge portions, and inexpensive. Breakfast or lunch, it's definitely one of my favourite places in Durham."}
{"text":"If your looking for good food and at a reasonable price Angelique's is it. Their soups are great and so are their sandwiches. A lot of stuff to look at while waiting for your food. Quick Service with a smile."}
{"text":"Best breakfast diner in Ajax. There's always a line up without fail but the service is quick. Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing price   I went with my boyfriend in a weekday morning and I ordered the special which was 3 eggs, hash browns,bread and baked beans.  huge serving and got 4 eggs !   It was decisions and served to us very fast. The server was amazing and knew many of the people in there by name. Our coffee cups were never empty, the server was really on her A game!   Great place to go, much better then any over priced chain restaurant !"}
{"text":"- this place is no joke for a good family style breakfast. - turnover is fast. lines go fairly fast. - hashbrowns are super super good.  almost perfect with a really nice golden crust."}
{"text":"First time here, great breakfast, great service. I ordered Eggs Benedict Florentine, (comes with peameal bacon too). Food comes very fast and tastes great!"}
{"text":"So the culinary experience that has been all the rage is Angeliques in Ajax for Breakfast... Family owned operation which has seemed to become very popular with the locals.  Let's be honest, the food does smell delicious, and the portion sizes seem massive.  But all of this is from a spectators point of view as I was waiting in line outside in the cold for 20 minuets infront of 2 very annoying teenagers who were complaining about doing chores (God forbid).  I did notice that the place was completely full which is a great sign.  Then I noticed some of the smaller things, such as a long line out the door however multiple tables in which ladies are using chairs that are meant for guest to hold thier ever important hand bag.  One table, sure, 2 tables... OK... 3 tables... are you serious.... Suggestion for the staff and thier pocket books, tell these people that unless they are paying for an extra table worth of food for 2 more guest, get your bags off the chairs.... it will mean you can serve more tables and thereby getting a larger potential tip... anyways... on the the food... holy crap... portion sizes are good... if your Andre the Giant.... Shrek, or that asian dude who keeps winning the Nathan's Famous hot dog eating contest every 4th of July.  I would estimate no fewer then 7 eggs were harmed in the making of my Western Omlet which was still mildly bland but still good.  The Roasted Potatoes were very tasty (they were on  my wife's plate) but my Hash browns were a tad soggy...  the Pancake was the size of oh I would say a Frisbee  or a UFO...  and roughly the same thickness yet still fluffy.  Overall good meal considering the portion sizing and cost (you can feed a sizeable football team for the cost of a mcdonalds combo...).  This place I think could really be something great with a potential expansion into an adjoining unit and making the portion sizes just a tad bit smaller..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu!  Awesome soups!  A gem in Pickering indeed!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"AWESOME EGGS BENEDICT HERE! Gotta be some of the best I ever had.  They give you hefty portions no matter what you order and there is always a line up in the mornings so make sure you come at a good time before the rush sets in. It is a small place so be prepared to wait in a lineup that often goes out the front door. But it is worth the wait :)  The staff is very friendly and helpful and always will give you a heads up on what's good for the day.  Also make sure you try the homemade baked beans it is superb!"}
{"text":"Bust out the stretchy pants; we're heading to Angelique's! I've heard that the portions here are crazy from more than one person, not to mention the many rave reviews. It was time to see what the hype is all about.   It was midmorning on a Sunday and it was packed. It's a small space, but they use it efficiently. It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Luckily, there was no line, but one started immediately behind us. After about 10min, we were seated. The servers are cheerful, quick and efficient, small talk was minimal. They know how to get right down to business.   Drinks came and our food orders were taken. It wasn't long before the food arrived, even though it was still packed and the lineup was growing.    When the food arrived, I started laughing. All of the rumours were TRUE! I ordered a 2 egg breakfast and got 3 eggs. My man ordered eggs benedict; menu says it has 3 eggs, but it came with 5. FIVE FREAKING EGGS! We both loved our giant breakfasts. The eggs benny was great; piled with peameal bacon and smothered in hollandaise sauce that wasn't too salty, but very creamy. I made quick work of my eggs and sausage, but there was so many homefries! The homefries were alright, but I've had better.   We both couldn't finish. We tapped out and asked for a takeout container.    The service and prices were amazing. It is a very busy place, so there may be a wait to get seated. This place is busy for a reason!   Weekend breakfast? Get to Angelique's!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast here this morning on a recommendation from a friend, without question the best value in town and no doubt we will be back , that said the food made fresh is fantastic but it's pretty cLear what comes out of a box and I found them to be disappointing, I hope that they move away from the store bought stuff overall good place"}
{"text":"The portions are HUGE and the food is really good. I ordered the eggs benedict and got an extra egg! My husband ordered the corned beef breakfast sandwich, he said it was the best breakfast sandwich he has ever had. The service was great and the food was fast. We highly recommend this place, we will definitely be back, we found a new breakfast place."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled on this place in Ajax, and based on Yelp reviews decided to go.  We were not disappointed...this place has a great small town feel.  I ordered the all day breakfast and my friend ordered the Chicken Parmesan and a side greek salad.    Both meals were served quickly and were nice and hot.  The portion sizes were huge!  My eggs were cooked to perfection and the bacon was nice and crispy too.     We both really loved this place a lot and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and friendly service.  Would definitely be back if I ever come back to Ajax."}
{"text":"First time here - we came because of the restaurant's rep as being THE breakfast place in the area.  We lined up for about 20 minutes - and this is where any restaurant needs to set up an area for customers to line up without bugging people already seated.  We were lined up out the door and other people in line were holding up the door letting cold air in. Then other customers had a tough time getting out the door.  The restaurant itself is a country kitchen decor set in an industrial strip mall, so the ceiling are high which gave the place a schizophrenic, unreal vibe as if we were on the set of a TV show.  I ordered eggs over medium with peameal bacon and hash brown. Huge portions - I think I had 4 eggs!  The peameal bacon was tasty if underseasoned. Hash browns were cold.  Service was attentive if rough around the edges. Think \"Kiss My Grits Flo.\"  Overall an interesting experience - I'd probably come back after trying another breakfast place."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for a takeout order on Friday. The place was packed.  No wonder. The food was great.  I had the souvlaki on a bun and it was tender and well seasoned. Good fries too.  All 4 of us were happy with our meal. Can't wait to return and try something new at this little neighbourhood eatery"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best bacon I've ever had. They definitely don't leave you hungry.  It gets very busy on Saturdays but if you come on a Friday morning it's pretty quiet."}
{"text":"I love a place that poaches an extra egg in case they break one.. then give you that extra egg.  Can't go wrong here it's all tasty.  Further more, they serve coffee in proper big mugs, none of that 3 sip mug crap."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are giant. I had the peameal sandwich and could barely finish it all. So delicious!  This place does get busy weekend mornings, but the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"Great food. Quick service. Family style diner. No frills here but staff are friendly. Portions are big. Priced right. Our favourite breakfast spot. 3 eggs are our go to."}
{"text":"A small space, fun decor, cozy but bustling.  An absolutely full house when we walked in (always a good sign). Seated right away even though it was so crowded, great service, good food, decent prices.   Looking forward to our next opportunity to come back."}
{"text":"So great! Quirky decor and busy constantly. VERY generous portions and amazing service that makes the place feel like a small town restaurant. I'm pretty sure the whole town of Ajax is here on the weekend but, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great spot... Loved it.  Very much a \" home\" feel where the staff treats you like family.   The service was so great I was seated and eating with 15mins. The fastest service I have ever received in a sit-down restaurant. The food was great, just what I needed. Egg Country Omelette with home fires and bread. Just what a brunch meal should be. My Wife and I REALLY enjoyed our time here.   The only problem is location. Having said that I would probably return even though we live in Pickering 15-20min drive... GREAT SPOT. A MUST TRY, so check it out."}
{"text":"Angelique's is great!  I've only had the breakfast here but it's top notch compared to the big chains.  The service is friendly and fast and the portions are very generous and the price is very reasonable.   I'm a big fan of the sausages with breakfast and the home fries.   The only downside is that parking can be tight as it's in a strip mall and it's sometimes hard to get a table.  But that just means it's busy because of the great food.  (Always a good sign)"}
{"text":"Good Greasy spoon. Large portions cooked how they like it. It is a busy small restraunt. Lineup wasn't long. I was informed that it could be. Services was good & fast."}
{"text":"I definitely agree, this place is a hidden treasure.  In my opinion, the best restaurant for a casual breakfast & brunch in the Ajax area. It is well worth the drive in from Pickering.  You won't be disappointed with the atmosphere, quality dishes and food portions."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for a table during the weekends if you plan to eat here - its not a huge place and seating is limited - but indeed worth the wait, as it is one of the better Ajax establishments for breakfast - probably the best actually."}
{"text":"Big-league portions for a great price. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Had breakfast for lunch. Ordered the combination breakfast. Good eggs, good hashbrowns. The best bit was that they didnt make me choose what meat i wanted. I was giving all the meat; peameal, bacon, sausage, and ham."}
{"text":"A nice all day breakfast place. I personally used to like it more a few years ago but it is still a nice place to visit. The atmosphere is a lot calmer than most breakfast places."}
{"text":"Hefty portions are only one reason to enjoy a meal here. Trust me and the other reviewers that you will feel that you get value for your money.   The servers are all friendly and attentive. When it's really busy they staff accordingly so you never feel that they are overburdened. Busier than a one-armed paper hanger in a one legged butt kicking contest maybe... However they are always smiling.   The chefs actually think and aren't just mindless line cooks. The breakfast specials include toast and baked beans of which I don't eat either. Without asking my meal always arrives with extra food on it to compensate for the missing stuff and makes the plate still look full. When I order the same way in other restaurants I get the plate with a big hole where the food would have gone yet I get charged the same.   Parking is at a premium here but it's only a short walk from the street or across the road.   When I have a day off this is my go to place to start my day off right."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. We read the reviews and came with our appetites. Huge portions served up by some of the friendliest waitresses we've ever met. Helped us with trip planning as well. As advertised, the food is wonderful and plentiful. We arrived late on a weekday and had no wait and didn't need food until a late dinner hours later. A little hard to find from the highway, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon. Place was busy but we got a table immediately. Got the combination breakfast and they give you a ton of food. We had to pack some away. Service was nice, slightly on the slow side because they were so busy but nothing unbearable. Overall, I am bringing stretchy pants next time."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, really good prices. 3 of us had a large breakfast with coffees and came to $30 after tax."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, you're never going to go wrong with a breakfast place in an industrial neighbourhood - but Angelique's was better than expected - it's bright and cheery, well staffed with really friendly folks, and the food is great. Not greasy. Not oversalted. Not the usual greasy spoon dreck. It was really quite a great experience. I do business around here and I think it'll be a great place to grab a bite with folks working in the area."}
{"text":"Even though the location is in a middle of an industrial park, doesn't seem to stop people from lining up for this place.  I fell in love with this place instantly as the second I stepped in. The decor is beautiful, they hang old furniture off the ceiling and the whole place looked really interesting.   The service was great. We immediately offered a seat and water. They were really busy yet she still remembered to check in with us once a while and topped our water.   The food is amazing. The portion is crazy massive and their home fries is one of the kind delicious. We didn't get to finish our meal because we were both so stuffed, had to pack the rest to go.   Overall it was really pleasant dining here and we would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Big plates, tasty & fresh!!  Great breakfast place ..   But!!! No one told us about the \"Sharing fee\"... apparently you have to be a big guy to full enjoy this portions..  I have to say that 4 $ was big disappointment"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch to celebrate my birthday, and it was such a good decision.   The place was busy for a workday (Friday), but there were still a few open tables so we were seated immediately.   The service was incredibly fast also. We ordered and received our food probably within 10 minutes. And everything on the plate was absolutely phenomenal. I ordered the Combination Breakfast with sausage, bacon, peamal bacon, ham, baked beans, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and cranberry pancakes.  The portion of food for only $12 was massive! And everything was cooked to perfection. If you ever go, definitely try the cranberry pancakes as they were probably my favourite part of the meal. The waitress also commented that the cranberry pancakes were her favourite out of all the pancakes on the menu. I'd definitely go back just to have them again."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  All day breakfast at real great value. We ordered eggs benny with hasbrowns, cheese, broccoli and potato soup and a ham and Swiss on a croissant all for about $22 before tip.  We left stuffed!  I scoped out everyone else's meal in the dinner and it ALL looked great.  I'm new to area and I know that this will become a staple establishment for us!"}
{"text":"This family american style breakfast restaurant. Hubby ordered country style and i ordered tuna sandwich. Quite good and huge portion. My portion is include soup of the day."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the portion of food is Americanized.  Friendly servers, the décors could use a little help but the quality of food trumps all other \"flaws'.  Check it out and go there with a big appetite!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for breakfast for the past 3 years. Service is friendly, place it kept very clean, food portions are good, turn over is fast... all of the above has been consistent everytime I've gone so I would give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"On numerous occasions we've visited here (pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy and accompanied by a toddler), we've always had a fantastic experience here.    We've egregiously dine on steak eggs benny, chili with garlic bread, regular breakfasts,  mountain of pancakes and other unspeakable things we'd eat for a brunch, they've all been damningly delicious here.    Their portions are as hefty as their server's genuine care for the patrons and that's what will always bring me back to Angelique's.  Can't wait to bring the extended family over to this fantastic spot for a fantastically gorgeful weekend."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for breakfast. The food is fantastic and so is the service. The eggs Benedict are to die for."}
{"text":"Portions are big for the price! The BLT is under $7 and barely finished it. Eggs Benedict was huge, but the Hollandaise sauce is from a package and bland. Cut back 1 egg and make sauce from scratch and I'll order them every time! Just missing that great Hollandaise zip!  Can be a squeeze at the front doors on weekends as it's a popular breakfast place. Usually no longer than 15 minute wait for brunch."}
{"text":"Holy portion size.  Love how much you get.  The food is good and the servers are attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place really feeds you.  Everything we ordered, although on the menu looking perfectly harmless actually was beyond monstrous in size.  The eggs florentine was extremely large and will probably will be mentioned at every brunch session from now on: muffins topped with 3 huge pieces of Peameal bacon, topped with a ton of spinach, topped with 4 poached eggs, topped with a generous pouring of Hollandaise sauce, with at least 1 pound of hash browns on the side, with a cup of baked beans.  I attest that all of the above is very delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for a Christmas gathering with family friends. Considering it's breakfast, the food here is actually NOT greasy. Hefty portions. Regulars include constructions workers in the area.  Eggs florentine here aren't actually vegetarian, so make sure you ask for the peameal bacon to be excluded. As Stacy reviewed, you actually get FOUR eggs. Spinach was a bit old and brown. Hash browns were bland. Baked beans are vegetarian and not cooked with bacon.  Great service, quick and cheap.  3.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"I heard à lot about this place before i went this morning. The portion sizes were good. I love baked beans with my breakfast, so I was happy with that.  The food was good and came really fast. Like the food I felt rushed to order. So my first experience was ok, but I will be going back for seconds."}
{"text":"Was searching for new breakfast/brunch places in the local area and came across this gem thanks to Yelp. Because of the many positive reviews (and pictures) I was adamant on trying this place. Let me just say, I was not disappointed. The atmosphere was cute, a little old (with vintage interior and decor) but definitely warm, comforting and family friendly. Upon arrival, we were greeted with huge smiles and given the option to sit anywhere we liked. Our server was very kind, helpful and continued to have a positive attitude all throughout our time being there (she was always on her feet and left positive remarks about everything). She had also mentioned Angeliques was owned by a family and the husband himself was one of the cooks in the kitchen (which I loved since it's a family owned business).   Onto the food, I ordered the Philly cheesesteak eggs benedict (with no peppers/$15.95) and since then it has been my go-to everytime I'm there. The steak was juicy, the eggs made perfect and the hollandaise sauce was unlike any other (personally, I find it hard to come across good hollandaise sauce which is why I say this). This breakfast came with home fries and baked beans which was more than enough for my appetite. While my partner ordered the steak eggs benedict ($15.95) and had nothing to complain about except for that he was happily full. All in all, the service provided is exceptional, the food even better and my favourite part, their portions are huge making it worth the money (and trip).   Any downsides? Parking is fairly limited and the restaurant gets very busy, especially during peak hours. However, takeout is available so if you don't get a table you can enjoy the comfort food of Angelique's at home!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot, food, service,  speed, and price....... in a homey setting.  Can't all for more!"}
{"text":"Super cute diner in Ajax, feels like you're having breakfast at Grandma's house.  They serve baked beans with everything lol.  Always packed because it's so good, definitely need to go there if you live in Ajax/Pickering"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after reading the yelp reviews.  It was very good, and worth the trip to Ajax.  This restaurant gets super busy on a weekend. The parking lot was packed but there is lots of street parking available.  We went for 10am and had to stand in line outside to get in. But, the line moved quickly.  We had a table within 10minutes.   As you'll see from the pics on their yelp page the servings are huge.  I got the combo breakfast with hash browns, bacon and sausage, and blueberry pancakes. It had four eggs when it came.    About the food, I liked most of it. I found the hash browns flavourless. There was no seasoning. It tasted watered down. I didn't enjoy them.  I did like the home fries my friend got, so if I go back, I'll get those instead. The pancakes were ok. They were dense and heavy.  So I wasn't able to eat much of them.  My friend had steak and eggs and she enjoyed her meal.   The coffee was pretty good. They give you a nice big mug!    The service was excellent. The wait staff were really good, quick and friendly.    The ambiance was very nice. Cute little family place that was uniquely decorated.  I'd definitely come back.  I'd love to try their omelettes and eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"The other Yelp reviewers were not kidding when they said the portions here are huge.  I got a corned beef omelet with a side of peameal bacon.  That was a stupid choice.  Not because it wasn't delicious, but because it was a stupidly large amount of food.  I finished about half the omelet and gave up.  The menu features a selection of traditional breakfast foods, English favorites, and delicious omelets.  I would come back.  But if I do come back, you'll bet I will order a smaller breakfast!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, incredibly friendly and fast service. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're up for breakfast or brunch, be prepared to line up at door because this place gets packed almost everyday it is open but, fear not they move quick and never have to wait for too long to grab a seat. Help yourself and sit anywhere you like if you see an open table. Friendly staff who always seem to remember your face and your usual orders. Portions are fantastic so you better come hungry! Hot sandwiches here are amazing too, where else can you find comforting home food like this? Atmosphere is kitchy and collectic, reminds me of nostalgic backyard tea garden meets grandma's kitchen. Do not bother with other fancy breakfast franchise restaurants, it's not worth the price or service for what you are getting compared to Angelique's. This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast! Friendly staff and the food is great, from the breakfast special to the eggs Benedict and even a great Gyro for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came for sunday brunch with my husband  - waited in line for about 15 min, tables rotate fairly quickly. We ordered the philly steak breakfast platter, the breakfast poutine & the Philly cheesesteak accompanied by the broccoli potato cheddar soup - everything was much larger than anticipated and tasted fabulous! The staff were impeccable - so friendly and fast! I can't believe I've lived in ajax for 12 years and haven't come here sooner! Will def return!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Durham! The portions are huge and delicious. So much food on every plate! This place is always busy, but the line goes fast. They even have great lunch options like wraps and sandwiches. Try their Caesar wrap!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the Pickering Flea Market last Saturday and decided to Yelp search the area. Came across Angelique's and decided we simply needed to find the place!  There is a line that forms out the door, so wear your warm clothes just in case you have to wait. Once we made it inside, I was incredibly impressed by the warmth of service coming from the staff. It is a small restaurant with maybe 15 tables but it had at least 7 women serving with a smile.  The menu was extensive and i wanted to try it all. But I went with the Corned Beef Hash breakfast. My only disappointment was with the hash itself. While it was delicious, i felt like there could have been more. All the plates coming out were heaped, but I guess because I got the hash i had a little less. I mean, not that I need more to eat, but I found I finished quickly and sat staring longingly at my boyfriend's plate. Thankfully, he had leftovers that I confiscated from his plate.   Overall, very delicious food, friendly staff and good prices!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here after reading the reviews and we're glad that we did! We were immediately seated after checking in. Daughter and I shared a small poutine and cranberry pancakes. Let me tell you. It wasn't small. We had to bring the rest back home. Daughter and I loved it and thought it was delicious! Cranberry pancakes were great as well. It was nice and fluffy unlike the dense ones we had elsewhere a day earlier. Hubs had the Eggs Florentine with peameal bacon on the side.  He liked the eggs florentine and thought it was ok. Peameal bacon was a bit overdone and hard to chew. Coffee was great and strong. Daughter ordered hot tea and it came in a teapot already steeped. She wasn't used to that because she's usually just given hot water with a teabag on the side. Steeped tea was a nice touch.  Place looked kitschy and we liked it a lot. Service was quick and very friendly. Will definitely return when in the area!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot, like a couple times a month. Service is excellent, quick and attentive with a little bit of that tongue in cheek hostility you expect at a great breakfast joint.   The coffee is pretty good here, better than most breakfast places I've been to. I keep meaning to try everything on the menu, but I keep coming back to the Eggs Benny. can't go wrong there - they do it right, tons of food for a good price.   The combo breakfast, club sandwich, breakfast poutine (for a very hungover morning), and egg wraps are all spot-on too. Highly recommend coming here on a Saturday/Sunday morning. Sometimes gets packed though, so make sure to be early or late, depending on the amount of alcohol still in your system."}
{"text":"Amazing value. Big portions. Great service. Kind of hard to find without a GPS. I would have breakfast here 3 days a week if I lived in Ajax."}
{"text":"Their eggs benedict and brocolli soup are divine. The servings were hefty too so make sure you're really hungry before coming here. It gets pretty busy especially on weekend mornings so try to come early. For us we didn't really wait for a long time, the staff were pretty good with the seating arrangement and they were friendly too. I love going here after church on sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Very casual, standard fare diner food.  You get a lot, and there is a nice variety on the menu.  The waitress was very nice, and the food came fast!  It's located in an industrial strip mall, really easy to miss.  Gets pretty packed, so don't expect privacy."}
{"text":"Amazing, large portioned food for so little. Been here twice and both times the food and service has been great. The waitresses are so amazing and the lineup moves very fast. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cute little all day breakfast spot in ajax.  I was feeling under the weather so I just had their split pea soup.  It wasn't bad but it could have been hotter.  My niece enjoyed their eggs Benedict and for the price they charge you get a hefty serving of it.  Great place if u love breakfast food."}
{"text":"Awesome family restaurant. There were 6 of us including two toddlers. All of the servers were extremely friendly and on top of everything! Great food, clean restaurant. Our server came over multiple times to offer fresh coffee and our delicious breaky came out within 7-8 minutes of ordering on Saturday morning! We will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"The place is small but already very busy early friday morning. Ordered the breakfast special with sausage which comes with 3 eggs, 4 sausages, hash brown/or home fries, baked beans and 2 slices of toast for 6.95! What a surprise to find 4 eggs on my plate! Turns out they always give an extra egg!! Food was plentiful, delicious and came out fast. Service was attentive and efficient. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had the New York steak eggs Benedict and the peameal bacon eggs Benedict, with a small breakfast poutine to share. We quickly learned that the portions are big and maybe should not have gotten the breakfast poutine!  The steak that I asked for medium-rare was perfect. The peameal bacon were thick slices, not your usual thin sliced ones that you see at most breakfast places! All eggs benedicts  come with 4 eggs, and all of the eggs were poached perfectly (medium and soft for me) as requested.  Definitely recommend this place! There are tons of items to try! I've lived in Durham region for a while and I can't believe I'm only try this place now.  Also, customer service was is excellent. All of the ladies (who took the orders) were very nice and friendly like a family-type restaurant should be."}
{"text":"For brunch, this is a great choice if you are out in the east end of the city.  It is in an industrial area that is a bit of a challenge to find if you don't know Ajax, but it is worth persevering.  It makes up for its surroundings with a warm, small town interior that is bright and comfortable.   The servings are very generous and well prepared.  I enjoy the quiche but I've not gone wrong with anything I've tried.  Be prepared to take food home or come very hungry; most dishes have twice the portion size of another restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here once by fluke (was lost in the area) and im thankful I did because this breakfast spot is a hidden gem. On weekends the wait is about 10/15 min for a table. They have huge portions, everything is made fresh and the service is awesome. I've tried their eggs Benedict (they have the best in the city), their omelettes are stuffed with veggies and flavor, and their breakfast poutine is heaven on a plate (home fries, cheese curds and gravy yum). I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is a gem. Located by the industrial area of Ajax, the restaurant offers all day breakfast that hits home. Portions are HUGE. Best bang for your buck. Coffee is also great tasting, not the cheap stuff you get at other breakfast spots. Make sure you go early on the weekends for brunch, as it does get quite busy."}
{"text":"By far my favourite breakfast place! Always a line up out the door so try to get here early, but even if there is a line up it's worth the wait. Service is always friendly, quick and just lovely. HUGE portions but also very delicious and not greasy."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get breakfast in town, especially with their early morning special (7-11 am). The service is incredible, they're so friendly and I've never had a bad experience here after all the times I've been. 10/10 would recommend!"}
