{"text":"Nice service but no Alcohol or wines served was disappointing Lighting was to bright for dinner made the atmosphere a little more on the cafeteria feel. Food was good"}
{"text":"Party of 3 for lunch. First time there. Two had a chef salad that was good but nothing special. I had a hamburger that tasted unlike most burgers. It didn't sicken me so not sure what it was. Fries were ordinary. Service was ok. We're the only ones there. Doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall. It's been here since September and I've never seen it. We came here cause we wanted some pupusas after soccer practice. Inside has a very intimate setting. The dim lighting and white upholstery gives it a modern look but with some casino vibe. The menu has alot of options. Lots of seafood,pasta and steak options. 
We walked in and ordered 5 pupusas revueltas (tortilla stuffed with beans,cheese,pork) at $2.25 each to go. And that took 20 minutes to make fml. So definitely order ahead of time to avoid wait time. Once we got home they were soo good! At most places you go to they will cheap out on you and put more beans and cheese and barely any pork. But these had alot of pork. The size was about my palm and it was very thick.  Came with curtido and tomato sauce. Maybe I'll come back and try the rest of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"An excellent dinner! They are mostly Mexican but have steaks, pasta, and seafood. Our table had some of each and it was all good. The server was absolutely awesome. Very affordable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great place, if you want to join a family restaurant this is the place to go,  Their menu looks delicious,  We only tried a few items and they were delicious,"}
{"text":"Best Food In Vegas Since I Been In Vegas And I Been Here For Almost 4 Years Now... The Pastas ... The Steaks... The STUFFED BAKED POTATO ... WOW... I'm Very Picky And I Can Almost Eat Everything On The Menu ?"}
{"text":"Excelente servicio. La comida deliciosa. Un lugar para disfrutar en familia. Altamente recomendado. Pulpo al ajillo no pueden dejar de probarlo!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend on the night before my birthday. The staff was very friendly and patient as well as took the time to explain to us what items on the menu was and give their opinion. The food was excellent. We ordered the seafood soup and the crab with stuffed potato. I don't recall the names from the menu. We will be returning soon with friends."}
{"text":"Visted this restaurant on 3/31/18. Great service and great food. Nice, chill atmosphere. Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Great little find. Their image is very upscale. It's good to see restaurants make an effort to look nice. I went in for a quick lunch, I saw they had awesome steak and lobster options! The staff was great and very attentive. Solid little place."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices.  Large portions.  Service is excellent. Had the Coquilles de Mariscos for appetizer.  We each had the shrimp for dinner.  I had the tempura shrimp and my hubby had the other type of shrimp.  Both were very good.  Lots of food.  Go there with a big appetite. The chips and salsa were great.  Because I had read the review that there was a 20 minute wait for the pupusas, I ordered them ahead of time \"to go\" so I would have a snack for later.....however, I was still full from dinner.  Very clean restaurant.  The decor is quite beautiful.  Will go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is delicious! Best restaurant in the neighborhood. The soup was perfect for the cool night and the sizes of the plates are very generous. Delicious desserts."}
{"text":"El Congo is a brand new restaurant on Rainbow & Smoke Ranch.
Everything inside this place is new and very clean!  Don't be thrown off by it's name.  They serve a wide variety of International dishes.  This place is a Must-Try; Must-Go!

Been to this place twice and each time, we were very pleased and delighted with the food, service and the prices!  Very affordable & delicious food!

The first time, we ordered the \"Mix\".  A platter filled with delicious seafood ~ meaty lobster & crab, large shrimps cooked in different styles.  The second time, we all each had their very tasty ribeye.  We also had some pupusas.  I love that their chips come with salsa that is not spicy.  I'm sure if you want it spicy, they'll make it that way for you.

We can hardly wait to go back and try more dishes from El Congo.  By the way, El Congo is a place in El Salvador."}
{"text":"Great outdoor or indoor area with a sweet menu of lunch and dinner items. 

Chips and salsa were very fresh! 

Baked potato with filet was amazing with cooked vegetables. Next time I will try the steak! Everything on the menu looks great"}
{"text":"Sad.  Sad.  Sad.  Not even one positive thing to say about this restaurant.  Food tasteless, inadequate in every way.  It will close in Q12018."}
{"text":"the best food, food prices, great service I recommend it I went from LA just to go eat there it was worth it tho"}
{"text":"Good Mexican and Central American food reasonably priced,  Seafood dishes are my favorites.  Good desserts and appetizers.  Since they cook from scratch service is slow but worth the wait.  Place is spacious and ambiance is delightful.   Try the big dish which has everything.  Gr8 tortillas and soups."}
{"text":"Delicious food, decent prices and clean place. Their portion is super generous too. We really like our meals, will come back!"}
