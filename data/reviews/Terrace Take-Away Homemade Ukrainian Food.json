{"text":"If you're in the area of Dundas/Trafalgar, on a Thursday/Saturday/Sunday, this is definitely a unique experience!  It's a food sale inside a Ukrainian Catholic church.  All religious organisations should follow suit!  Anyway, just follow the signs that lead into a room that has a counter with chafing dishes and some industrial sized fridges.  Someone actually approached me, asked if it was my first time, and helped me to order!  P.S.  He also tried to upsell me, so that guy was doing his job.  In comparison to dining out, prices are quite reasonable.  A dozen pierogies were ~$8, a tall plastic container of soup was $6, $10 for 8 smallish, but adequate sized cabbage rolls, etc.  Menu is also online, so you can call ahead!    With the exception of the baked goods, everything else is made on-site.  Soup was really tasty and garlicky!  It only had goosha of beets.  Rice/pork cabbage rolls were REALLY good.  There were other kinds available as well.  They also stamp a loyalty card with each purchase and when it's full, you get some bonus pierogies.  I'd definitely go back to try some other EE specialties!  Btw, it's takeout only.  So no place to sit.  Service was nice, but more \"relaxed\".  Lady in front of me was ordering a feast!"}
