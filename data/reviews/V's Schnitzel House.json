{"text":"If you like slow service and screaming kids running around, this place might be for you!
The staff were slightly friendly and the menus are very nice; filling me with anticipation!  Unfortunately this would fade along with the hope of a good meal when the appetizer finally made an appearance after a good long wait.  The fried cheese is huge which would appear to be a good thing until you realize it is quite bland and boring!  After a while of surveying the screaming kids run around, and watching take-out people come-and-go, the main course was served, it appears take-out steals precedence over peeps that are sticking around.  The schnitzel feast, like the cheese was huge and boring.  Finally a bit more waiting to get the bill and our 1 hour extravaganza was over.  In fairness they were a bit busy (there was one other large table), and I don't mind waiting for good food.  Sadly this was not good food..."}
{"text":"I ate here and found the place to be QUITE DIRTY - here's a hint to the owner: how about washing the curtains on the windows once every couple of years???  Just for starters...  Also, I had seen this place driving past and stopped by SEVERAL times and they were closed at the strangest times, like on a Saturday at lunch time, on a Thursday at dinner time...  I don't get the erratic executive hours...  Not a pleasant experience.  I think the reviews are probably written by the owner and her family and friends. This is the kind of place you just drive past - never mind bringing a date or your family here..."}
{"text":"This spot used to be Liba's. The name has changed but the food is still great. My fianc√© and I ordered a schnitzel meal and a German schnitzel sandwich.  Everything was fresh and very tasty. I definitely recommend the sandwich."}
{"text":"Great choice! My husband is very particular, and it is hard to get him to try new places. He is ying to my yang in that my life is not complete unless I am seeking out little \"hole in the wall\" destinations. 
We had driven past V's Schnitzel House a few times before I caught him at a weak moment - hungry! - and finally pulled in. He was in no mood to fight me, however did say that if we walked in & there was no other patrons, we would have to turn around and leave ;)
Good thing for both of us that there were two other couples lingering after finishing their lunches. 
Krombacher on tap was the place to start... then onto the Schnitzel!
I fell in love with this dish on our trip to Vienna and I would say that V is as close as I have found. The only thing missing was the sweet counterpart to the salty (lingonberry jam or some sort of berry sauce). They did offer a Dill sauce that was yummy... but not the same. 
I was very impressed. Clean establishment and good tasting food. 
Let's be clear - this is not a place to impress a date or to go for a special occasion... it is warm, homey, casual & you would be welcome with jeans and a T-shirt (even if there was a stain). 
We will be back when that longing for Europe erupts!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm scared of having this place so close to me. I tried the chicken schnitzel which was a very solid size for a big guy and came with potatoes / salad. I've never been to a Schnitzel house, but if I closed my eyes and pictured one it would look exactly like this place. 

It's an Alderwood gem!"}
{"text":"This is the best schnitzel in Toronto. The owners are so wonderful and care about their customers. We have been coming here for several years. The goulash is spectacular as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing friend cheese and the schnitzel is excellent!! Their home fries are marvellous!  V's truly have authentic Slovak cooking!! Awesome comfort food, great value and friendly staff. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is slow (mom and daughter doing everything) and their hours are inconsistent. It's like they just open when they feel like it. As a result, we don't go often because we never know when they're going to be open. Literally, you have to be driving by while hungry and if they're open, you swing in."}
{"text":"13 years.  This is how long this business has been here.  I had no clue, none.  I had noticed this place passing by a number of times only recently when heading down to Lakeshore from the 427.  I had to ask how long this place has been open because I had no idea.  13 years... wow.  

What makes this restaurant less conspicuous now is their new sign.  It's easier to see and it stands out a lot more.  That's how I found this place - by seeing it for myself.  On the west side of Brown's Line along with that Cuban place, OBQ Burger and a bunch of other businesses this south Etobicoke neighborhood is sort of a mix of small businesses on the main street and homes.  It's not hard to miss some of these places on your way up and down Brown's Line between the QEW/427 and Lakeshore.  

While there's no parking on Brown's Line V's does have parking behind their restaurant.  There's not too many spaces but there was one left by the time I got there.  The entrance is on the north side through a glass door and then a big thick door the kind you would probably have as a door to a house.  The inside sort of feels that way, like a house because the decor has a very homey feel to it.  Wooden tables and chairs, eastern European artwork and knick knacks are around and while the layout is simple and spacious you can see into the open counter to the kitchen where \"V\" is working the magic.  

It's obviously a family business as there's a young girl taking our orders, and a young boy at the table nearest to the kitchen doing his homework.  There were several other patrons inside enjoying drinks and dinner as well.  The feeling I get that this place is a locals kind of place and being around for well over a decade is a good indication that the business is doing something right to be able to keep things going for that period.

My friend and I go out to eat every once in a while and I had chosen this place knowing that I've wanted to try it for some time.  I had looked up the menu online and their prices seemed quite reasonable.  While the namesake of the establishment does have schnitzel in their name they do have some other dishes such as souvlaki and other varieties of pork, chicken and goulash.  This place for me definitely falls under the comfort food section for me.  

We both started with a nice heavy glass stein of Krombacher and placed our orders.  My friend went with the wiener schnitzel dinner which includes a small side salad, a veal schnitzel and what is referred to as V's potatoes.  V's potatoes as from the menu, \"V's potatoes are boiled cubed and lightly pan roasted with house blend of spices\".  I had ordered the combo plate which is the same thing but it also adds breaded cheese and mushrooms on the side.  Either of those are available as appetizers but are included in the combo (one generous piece of breaded cheese and 4 breaded mushrooms all made with the same type of breading as the schnitzel.  

The wiener schnitzel dinner is 14 dollars.  The addition of the appetizers that make up the combo plate is basically another 6 bucks on top of that because the combo is 20 dollars.  This is a great deal.  We ended up sharing the appetizers and we both had enough to bring home as neither of us finished the meal.  It's a lot of food for 2 men that can eat!  

The entire meal is as the place itself feels... like home or at least eating dinner in somebody's home.  I didn't feel like a customer here - I felt like a guest.  The food is really good by the way if what I had to say didn't come across that way I have a way of going on a tangent forgetting to complete my thought.  

Besides the food tasting great you also get a pretty generous quantity of it as well.  As I said I couldn't finish it AND I shared part of my meal as well.  If you know me that's pretty impressive as I it's not a common occurrence that I don't finish a meal.  

My bottom line, good food, good value, nice feel and not far from home... win, win, win, win."}
{"text":"Staff was very helpful and polite (first visit). 
The lunch crowd decent, wait wasn't too long. 
The sandwiches are very big, good deal. I had the plate with potatoes and mini salad. Schnitzel might not be your first choice for a 'healthy' meal, it it's however very tasty. The chicken (also have pork) schnitzel (huge portion) with potato, salad $16.95.
Will return."}
{"text":"Good schnitzel - not too thin with a good amount of meatiness and done crispy!  Good prices and portions - staff is super.  Fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Argentinian schnitzel is the best but everything I've had here is great.  Mother and daughter run, we hadn't been here in a little while and they still remembered what we almost always order.  Highly recommend for schnitzel.  Best in the city."}
{"text":"Best schnitzel I have found in Toronto! From the photos in the reviews I expected it to be heavy and greasy, but it was amazingly light and crispy. 

There is a place around Yonge and Eg that claims Toronto's best schnitzel...they are not even close. When you order there, they take a previously made schnitzel out of a cooler and nuke it. Gross. 

Everything here is made fresh to order, and you can taste the difference. I enjoyed the dill sauce, but would also prefer a lingonberry sauce or even an applesauce, as another poster suggests. 

The dining area is nothing special. Not a date night...or even a place to linger with friends, but fine for a quick everyday meal. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5* then a 3 but good nonetheless. 

I think we were served by the owner/chef. It was earlier then a normal lunch time. I ordered the chicken fingers with a side salad. The salad dressing was very delicious. Nice & dilly & garlicky. They should sell this stuff. The chicken fingers were good & made of real chicken. The only issue is there wasn't much chicken after frying. I also asked for \"well-done fries\" but they came out only regularly done, a bit disappointed with that. All-in-all this was a decent little place with just slightly above average but I would do it again however."}
