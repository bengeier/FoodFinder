{"text":"Great drinks, friendly staff. Very affordable and tasty menu options! Get the Cajun dry rub wings - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is the best date spot in my opinion. Its cozy and the food is great. We always get great service and i love the secluded seating. Definitely in my top 3."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here recently and it was really good. But then i noticed a 50 cent surcharge fee on my reciept for carry out orders. Ive encountered some absurd practices in my life but this was beyond ridiculous. I wont be back"}
{"text":"Bar tenders are first class. Food is top notch for a tavern. Atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting."}
{"text":"Ok so I wanted 37 half boneless soy wings and 23 turkey wings smoked for 7 hours and deep fried but the waitress there told me it would take a full day to meet my request. I asked why and she said there were only 2 fryers. I felt hurt and disrespected by this because I had assumed the customer was always right. That assumption made an ass out of me. And now I cry myself to sleep. Thank you rush inn. Shakuille O'Neal you broke my heart."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in on a Thursday night. I was surprised by how busy it was, but there was live music so that might've been why. He had the gouda burger and I had the honey bbq chicken sandwhich. Both were good, and there were about a dozen other things on the menu that I probably would've been happy with. The prices were good for the sandwiches and the burgers, but the entrees got too pricey for me. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"The Rush Inn is easily my top go to in Lakewood. From the outstanding food, in a great menu selection I might add...anything you pick is a good choice. To the atmosphere, to the attentive and friendly service. We all like Brandon, he's very knowledgeable and will ansewer any questions you have with a smile, he is also willing to chit chat if you're down with that. To expand, I have never seen an unhappy face in the place. We all know you can throw a rock in Lakewood and hit a place to eat...but this place is by far the best!"}
{"text":"I came on a Monday evening to have what we had hoped would be a delicious dinner. We had heard the food was good so we decided to try it out. Bar wasn't crowded, one server, and looked as though there were two bartenders. Ordered 2 orders of spinach pasta with chicken and broccoli. Ten minutes into our wait, we were told they only had one order of pasta. So, we subbed our one order for regular noodles. 10 more minutes, and the pasta came out, but with  no garlic bread. The waitress asked if we wanted it? We were puzzled, because it came with it, so of course we did? Pasta was a decent size portion, but the broccoli was limp, and soggy. Chicken was decent, blush sauce was okay, but the olive oil and garlic sauce was AWFUL. No seasoning to anything, we had to salt and cheese the heck out of both of our plates. 10 more minutes and 2 pieces of white barely toasted garlic bread came out, which we also had to add more salt and cheese. The server explained that it wasn't plugged in? She tried to say she didn't forget about the garlic bread, but it was clear, the kitchen equipment wasn't checked for 20 minutes, nor was the stock checked before cooking began. Our bill was 40 dollars...and the worst 40 we have ever spent. Sorry, will not return."}
{"text":"The Rush has the best bartenders especially Jeanie!"}
{"text":"I used to love the Rush inn.. was our go to place;  went to last night - seated awkwardly in the back under bright light. Served sub par food my friend got his wings when I was done eating!  9 50 a beer $8 for a small platter of frozen style french fries $11 for a flave less chicken gyro. SO disappointing Rush!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Kim D. ROCKS she is the best waitress ever! Great wings! Great food! Amazing Service! Don't forget to try the mussels!"}
{"text":"Second time at Rush Inn and we had great food and service both times! The atmoshere is what you would expect, nothing fancy but clean and comfortable. The fish sandwich was one of the best I've ever had! So well cooked with a unique tartar sauce and super fresh bun. The food came out really fast too and our waitress checked on us often but not in the annoying way :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I popped in on a Friday night for a couple beers. We liked the feel of it (felt more old school, local, and way less crowded than the other Lakewood bars) and after taking a look at the food menu, my boyfriend and I decided we just had to come back the next day for lunch. The menu was seriously extensive, and all the burgers, sandwiches, and ethnic foods (paprikash, yum!) sounded delicious.  When we got there for lunch, the Indians game was on, sound and all. For some people that might not be a positive, but I was so happy I could watch and listen to the game over lunch. Our server was very friendly and prompt. I got a philly style brisket wrap. I didn't LOVE it, which is the only reason Rush Inn gets four stars instead of five. The meat was kind of bland and the only flavor came from the horseradish sauce (which was delicious). The cole slaw was pretty good, if a little bland as well. My boyfriend got a gouda burger and fries, and both were totally awesome. The burger was cooked just right and the flavor was perfect. The fries reminded me of what you'd get in a cup on a boardwalk by the beach, which is my favorite kind! We will definitely be back soon; I will just have to get a burger and fries next time!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Pirogies are delicious!!  I took my kids there and was worried because I don't like a bar atmosphere, but it was very kid friendly. They get very busy!"}
{"text":"My wife and i wanted some dinner last night and decided that we always enjoyed Rush Inn. Big mistake! The california chicken club I ordered was horrid. It was a good thing I cut my sandwitch in half because upon close inspection I found that the chicken was raw in the middle. And so was the chicken on my wife's chicken on my wifes salad. They appologetically remade it . It didnt get to eat for over a hour after my wife recieved her dinner. Then they charged her 10.00 for her salad plus $4 dollars for a piece of partially raw chicken and $1 for fetta cheese that was actually blue cheese. For a grand total of  $15.00 for the absolute worst salad I have ever seen. $15.00 for a chicken salad, you have got to be kidding me??? After raw food, the wait, and being over charged I would never go to or recommend Rush Inn to anyone!!! Some One was Rush'in and it wasn't me eating my dinner. The cook should loose the fancy shirt and pay attention to what he's doing in the kitchen! Your not a chef! You cook at a bar! And just barely! Very unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"A favorite stand by!!   This is always a great place to go for hot tasty bar food served with a smile...reminds you of cheers where everybody knows your name!  The cocktails are always consistent .  you have to try the chicken wings!   Wow! Is all I can say!  The garlic was tasty  cooked to crispy perfection!  And my rib dinner was cooked and served piping hot with BBQ honey Brussels sprouts! Who would have thought?    I was welcomed by all the staff  upon entry, and again upon leaving!  Jeanie our waitress is amazing! If you can ask for her,   she is beyond accommodating!  Always try to stop when I'm in the are, always consistent, always good!"}
{"text":"Great local place to take in a game with great service run of the mill drinks and standard but done right pub food.  Keepin it simple and tasty - ribeye's, wings and burgers."}
{"text":"Another one of my go-to spots in Lakewood. The servers are friendly, and make it a point to get to know their regulars. The food is ALWAYS delicious, and they are always updating their specials and seasonal menus. Another great thing about this place is the crowd... Young and old, everybody is super chill. I've never witnessed or heard of any fights or rowdiness. The only downside about The Rush Inn is the prices... they can run very high, especially if you're a craft beer drinker ($8+ for a tall Dortmunder). Fortunately for Lakewood folk, there are often coupons in the local circular, and they have great food specials (wing nights, burger nights, etc)."}
{"text":"Fast service, very decent food, nice environment. Nothing crazy unique or exciting but overall I had a very positive experience here. The portions are big!"}
{"text":"The Rush Inn is one of the better restaurants/bars in Lakewood. The booths are large and cozy and perfect for a date night. The crowd is a great mix of welcoming people. The service is also well above average.  The food is the show stopper here. The fish fry is absolutely fantastic and the sides (fries, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes especially) are well above your typical bar fare. The chicken fettuccine Alfredo also had great taste!   Overall the Rush Inn is a great spot for any night of the week."}
{"text":"Service was great. I ordered the Gouda burger, it was delicious. My friend ordered the chicken paprikash and Pierogis, it tasted like flower and paprika. It wasn't edible at all."}
{"text":"Love the rush. Been going there for years. Good drinks and sprits. Have a ton of friends who stop on in and say hi. The staff is amazing and I only wish they would lower some of their drink prices."}
{"text":"One of the best bars in Cleveland. Eric and Genie are excellent bar keeps and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I heart The Rush.   This place is always great to get a beer or nosh on some food.  For a \"dive-esque\" bar this place has some decent eats.  I almost always end up getting my usual....Nachos extra cheesy, extra spicy, and with a side of Chili.  t They have some nice vegetarian options here too.  The Hummus is always a good thing to get for some lighter-fare.    The bar tenders are great, treat them nicely and tip them well. If you stick around late enough on a Friday or Saturday night you'll get the After-Show crowd from the Beck across the street, and well...let's just say that can be either annoying or VERY entertaining.  I usually find it entertaining."}
{"text":"Great menu and not just bar food."}
{"text":"So, we stopped here on our way to the Side Quest, which is just up the street.   We did not know what to expect, but came on a 3$ taco night...  I'm so glad we did:)  Mostly, the Rush Inn is a bar-ish place, but there's plenty of back and side seating at booths all through. The place has a dark, rich wood tone, and the patrons were decent folks.  The tacos were EXCEPTIONAL, and their selection is quite good, with all sorts of stuff I intend to try as soon as possible. I think this place would make a nice casual dinner/lunch stop, and if you need to get beverage, the barkeep and wait staff will keep em coming!   So, for a quick tasty bite, don't walk slow, RUSH IN TO THE RUSH INN!"}
{"text":"Rush Inn definitely has the dive bar look, however it does not function as a dive bar, much nicer than one! Food was good. Average portion but the burger I had tasted great. There's an okay beer selection, not much for draft but a bit more in can/bottle. I got turned on to the Old Chub beer recently (I RECOMMEND) so I had to get in on that action.  Above all else, the service was 5 star! The hostess was very nice and addressed myself and my friend the second we came in. Our waiter was equally if not even nicer. Gave recommendations, had no miscommunication, he was just a positive person and a great waiter.   Overall: I'll go again, in a heartbeat. If I could give a 4.5 I would."}
{"text":"Best wings ever. And we're serious about wings. Gone are the days of dime wings. And for the most part, it's also difficult to even find good wings anywhere. At Rush they have wings like I remember from back in the day. Their big and cooked well, ask for extra crispy, the best! My fav is medium buffalo flavor. Actually nothing on the menu disappoints, great appetizers!  Genie is a great bartender, remembers everyone who comes back for a second time."}
{"text":"Our go to bar for a bite and a drink (or 2) before or after a performance at Beck Center across the street. And many times we have seen the cast stop after the show. We dined on Jumbo Wings (on wing night) and Teriyaki Chicken Appetizer. Excellent. Eric, the barkeep, is always eager to keep you and your glass full."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!! The bartenders are awesome and we will continue to keep going here! The food is great, love the daily specials like wing night and their tacos are great! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is a Cute little local dive bar! I said to my date, \"I feel like I could be in ANY Midwest city right now.\" This is your typical dive. A number of tvs on the walls playing sports, wood paneling, long bar.  Bartenders killed it. They were hilarious.   PBR on tap is $2; my style for real.   My friends aren't kidding. Get the Gouda burger with a pretzel bun; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Lakewood. Meals, Brews, and Service are always excellent! You can pick any dish on the menu and you will tell yourself,  \"I rock! For I made the best choice!\"  Brandon is an outstanding server...friendly, knowledgeable, a good conversationalist, and one cool cat!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten a meal at home in a little over a month.  Thankfully, \"The Rush\" is a capable fill-in.   Located just across from the Beck Center, it's a great place for burgers, wings and conversations with actors and neighborhood folk.  I've been there about 10 times now, and had the following:  Steak Sandwich-Not the best. Steak was GREAT, but in true Ohio fashion, it was again a slab of steak on a bun rather than sliced up. Some may like them this way, it can be a nice change...I don't.  Wings-Awesome  Burgs-Awesome   Murray mentioned the chili-Simple? Yep. Great? Yep.  Even their little salad is good, with a bunch of cheese and a couple different types of croutons.   The chili can also come on their nachos. Chili on nachos? Awesome.  They've got good beer specials, and you can find some wine here.  And one of my castmates lives on their chocolate martinis. Hey...me either, but she's beautiful and she can drink whatever the F#c% she wants. So suck on that.  A decent jukebox, tons of booths (some big enough to accommodate 10, with space to move and open enough to not have to shift everyone for bathroom breaks) and a great location on Detroit are some of the other features of this gem.  So yeah...you might run into some actors...perhaps even The Mayor of Detroit Avenue...but if that pisses you off, why did you come?   That said, a great spot. Will return a ton of times. Probably even tonight."}
{"text":"Listen. Rush Inn is the classier version of Cronies.   Jeanni, the bartender, is amazing. We love to play the game, I want... with her  It usually goes like this.  I want: something strong, tasting of cherries, and the color blue. She will do it. AND it will taste good!   Not to mention the amazing food. Cajon fries, wings and some of the best Chicken sandwiches around. Yum.  Visit here. And tip well. Jeanni will know your name by the end of the night."}
{"text":"i've been here once and that was the last time i'll stop in.  the food was typical average bar food, but what annoyed me was the service.  the bartender was some middle-aged lady who was nice/borderline annoying, who kept badgering us to try things on the menu which we didn't want.    but what was terrible about the entire time there was that there was another patron sitting at the other end of the bar who clearly didn't like the fact i was there; since he started ranting about racial issues...i can go to a town hall meeting if i need to talk about that, but if i'm at a bar, let me watch my game in peace, please!  i tell the bartender about it and she talked to him but it was a weak rebuke at best.  the guy kept his antics up...and she came over to apologize to us, to which i told her...\"it's your responsibility to make sure guests are comfortable...im not...and you didn't do enough.  ill take my check and you'll never see me back here again.\"  i've stay true to that promise."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Lakewood. The bartenders are all spectacular. I have never had bad service here ever. My favorite is Kim. Anything you expect in an amazing bartender she has.   The wings are probably top in Lakewood. I always come for wings but the Potato skins are outstanding. Very homey and they all remember you. If you're looking for a \"dive\" bar to remember this is the place to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars love the wings always great service drinks are good its very clean everything I've had is good ."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local bars of Lakewood, they have nightly specials I encourage you to take part in! Went last week for wing night had amazing service even though the bar was packed and only two bartenders. Plenty of sauce options and I believe only $.55 cent wings."}
{"text":"Although I've come to the bar here several times, I've only ever ordered their food once. It's a standard bar food menu. Burgers, fries, sandwiches, wings etc.  Drinks are kind of expensive for a Lakewood bar. $5 or $6 for a draft is a lot when you have so many other places nearby that are cheaper.  And the wings are definitely not the best in Lakewood. I haven't tried all the popular wing spots, but I definitely have other favorites.  Sorry to say it because I had high hopes.  I will say the service was great and everyone in the place was friendly."}
{"text":"When I walk into the Rush Inn I want to belt our \"Where Everybody knows your naaaammmeeee!\" Maybe it's just me, but I love that I have been coming to the Rush Inn for several years and the same great people work there. They know our names and we know theirs. They ask how we are and tell us they're glad we are back. It's just nice.   On first appearance, walking into the Rush Inn with is weathered door and prominent bar, you would think this is a towny dive bar. I assure you, it's so much more. Beyond the full bar and the keno the Rush Inn serves really excellent food & the menu is pretty extensive. My husband thinks they have the best wings in Lakewood. But they haven't participated in the wing crawl so there is no scientific data to back up this claim. I'm not the biggest chicken wing fan, but the garlic Buffalo Parmesan wings are [insert flying money emoji times three]. The meat comes off the bone cleanly and the skin is super crisp. I have enjoyed many items from their menu, including steak, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers... everything has always been satisfactory. I have to give a special shoutout to their French fries though. I have to get them every time.   Honestly, the Rush Inn just feels like community to me. If you happen to go in while the Cavs or Indians are playing, chances are they are going to be slammed. But they will find you a seat and they will take a few minutes to chat with you, even when they are running around. You will leave with a full tummy and a happy heart."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a couple colleagues on the way to a Yelp Elite Event (next door at The Sweet Spot). This small bar had a nice, charming feel to it with tall wooden benches and booths running parallel to the bar. Our bartender was extremely friendly and accommodating (mixed me a couple black and tans the way I like them, with Guinness and Smithwicks). Monday nights are \"taco\" nights, so I had a \"jumbo\" beef taco for $2.95 that was served on a puffy, flour shell. It was good. I also shared a pita and humus appetizer which had cucumber and tomatoes in it, making it refreshingly good. If the opportunity presented itself, I'd definitely like to return for a full dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite bar in Lakewood.  The food is very good compared to half the bars in town.  The menu selections remind you more of a restaurant instead your typical fried bar foods. From corned beef nachos to stuffed chicken you will find something appetizing.  The wings are a staple food here!  Best wings in Cleveland!   Opposite the bar you have several tables and booths to sit down and enjoy a conversation if it gets too loud around the bar.  Always a great place to hit up when your in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Whoever said this is your typical bar food is nuts...what bar has a stir fried veggie dish, home made mashed potatoes, home made soups, flat bread pizzas, peroghes and fresh veggies??   The place is outstanding.  The menu is huge and varied, something for everyone for sure.  6.00 burger night on Wednesdays!  Not to mention, the staff is very accommodating and friendly. Plus the music they play is great.  A great local bar that will serve you really good food....not just bar food, but REALLY good food!"}
{"text":"Continuous consistency, party of 12 adults/kids. Best wings in Lakewood, this visit tasty bbq and zesty teriyaki. Also generous sides of potato skins and mozzarella sticks. Others in party raved about the burgers, potato pancakes and \"really good\" fries. Timely service for a busy Friday night. Good noise level so kids are never an issue whether with you or at another booth. Friendly staff this night and always. Seafood and steak dishes always satisfying from previous visits, not what you'd expect from a \"bar food\" spot. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite bar in Lakewood. The staff here is second to none, always attentive and very friendly. They also have awesome food and a solid beer selection! To last 35 years in Lakewood they are obviously doing something right!"}
{"text":"Sports bar type of place. It was a quiet evening for them, the day after St. Patrick's day. Nice selection and fast, friendly service. Food was good, but not outstanding as some other reviews seem to say. I had the Yuengling Cod Sandwich. Crispy fried, tasty. I added malt vinegar. Mmm! My wife had the Beef Brisket Roll-Up (Philly Style), like a Philly Cheese Steak. Also quite good. Good prices for the quality so it's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Best bar in lakewood. Has the \"hole in the wall\" vibe while not being totally hole in the wall. Great food, great beer, great prices."}
{"text":"Great food.   Really great bartenders but Jesus Christ the liquor is more expensive than doing blow off a hookers ass on a Vegas weekend bender!!  I recomend just eating whats on special, drink one beer and then mosey on down the road to the other 100 bars in Lakewood that are cheaper."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, im surprised. Cuz I've been here a couple of times in the past and i wasn't impressed.  We order a couple of burgers and some wings, very good.  The bad thing was that the service and the drinks sucked big time.  The lady with the curly hair was very rude with us when we complained that the beers were warmed .  She totally gave me an attitude.  Otherwise i would give em 4 or even 5 stars.  I probably be back another time when she is not working!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard about this little place near Rush Inn that offered board games and poutine on Friday. When we arrived, they didn't have food because the chef didn't show up (?) so we ventured to this place a block down. Great vibe inside. A typical bar scene, but had great booze selections and a decently large menu to choose from. I ordered the grilled chicken wrap (smothered in buffalo) and my boyfriend ordered the soft crab sandwich.  BOTH WERE DELICIOUS!  We are both huge foodies, and consider ourselves pretty in tune with all the good eats in or around Cleveland, and this was a treasure of a find.   We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We've been here quite a bit in the last few years. We usually meet my parents up there for a burger and some beers. The most recent time we had our 20 month old daughter with us and we all enjoyed our burgers.  I love this place because it reminds me of growing up in Lakewood and when my dad would take me in to the bar to pay for his dart league. It's old wood and nothing fancy. I love it and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Classic lakewood bar decor with a homey restaurant feel. I love the tall wooden booth tables and the small bar on the other side in the midst of the booths. It's just a unique set-up. The staff is friendly and makes you feel like a regular. The food is good and they have great daily specials (i.e., TU/TH 0.55 jumbo wing night (they are jumbo), Friday fish fry and pierogies). It's just a great place to go for a cozy relaxed dinner on a fall or winter evening."}
{"text":"This place always seemed a bit divey for me when I walked by. It just looked \"old\" but I'm a little upset that I hadn't checked it out sooner.  Stopped in here on a Thursday night because a friend that lived nearby recommended it.  My group is all in their 20s. The clientele were mostly on the middle-aged side, but that didn't detract from our experience at all.   The service was phenomenal. Our bartender was very friendly and attentive. There was live music going on. The guy was doing a blend of Blues and Soul. We were originally right next to the performer but it was a little too loud so we had to move. It was a great vibe though and something you don't typically hear out at bars.   Wing night was going on and they were on special for 55 cents a piece. Delicious. Beers seemed a tad pricey. 3.25 for a Bud Light bottle and a friend was drinking tall Stone IPAs at 8.75 a piece. That bill racked up quick without him realizing! Chill atmosphere, great service, and decent food, but be prepared to pay for it."}
{"text":"Faux-wood paneling is usually not a good first impression for me [for almost any place]. More importantly, neither is playing Nickelback. On 7pm on a Wednesday night, it was only me and a regular at the bar. As the night wore on, the Rush Inn made me a believer.   A decent tap selection [2 great lakes, magic hat, PBR, harp, molson and maybe one other] and decent prices $4.50 for a pint of magic hat, $1.75 for a pint of PBR and what appeared to be a solid liquor selection [they even had Ouzo !] .   My bartender (think his name was brandon, i overheard) was a stud. Very quick, conversable, and attentive.   They had a few Wednesday specials:  mussels - meaty, only came with plain butter, but they were only $3.25 for a dozen and I expected nothing more.  Large cheeseburger (1/4lb, I guess) and fries for $5. I dislike fries, but these fries were they not limp, crisp but not too crunchy, and light on oil.  Both came out of the kitchen within a few minutes.   Even as the bar grew to nearly packed (aged 20-50, middle-class - no theater people when I was there), Brandon was still attentive to me and my compatriots who showed up later. Best service that I've had in some time. One of my friends just moved out to Lakewood, Rush Inn is a place I'll definitely keep in mind if I want a low-key bar looking to have a few beers with some good bar food."}
{"text":"My manfriend and I came here every Friday this past Lent for their fish fry.  Their LAKE perch is so good, it literally falls apart as soon as your fork touches it.  We sat in the same general area each time we came, and after just a couple weeks, the bartender remembered us and make us feel like real regulars. That was pretty nice.   I have never had anything other than the perch here, but their menu looks awesome and I am determine to.  It does get pretty crowed by 6:30, so we would always make sure to go right after work. Love it here."}
{"text":"What a great spot that has a homey feeling with great food and drinks!  There is not an attached parking lot (come on, no where is in Lakewood) but there is a metered lot not even a block away and other metered spots/side streets all around.  They place is kind of hidden and tucked away maybe because their signage is not great.  I have only been here for wing night which is a great deal.  Jumbo wings are $0.55 each and there are many flavors to chose from.  I got the hot garlic parm and they were great and super saucy.  I really enjoyed them.  The beer was a bit expensive for bar like this in Lakewood but I will have to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This bar has quickly become my favorite neighborhood bar. The service is always friendly and the food is superb. My favorite part is that it's not too loud and has the best of both worlds: a bar when you want to sit there with friends or tons of private booths when you want to have quieter conversations. This place is great for us late 20s/early 30s or later types who just want a cold brew after work without the loud atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh, Rush Inn.  How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways:  1. Wings. 2. Wings. 3. Lots of Killians. 4. Wings. 5. Tacos. 6. Random guy playing guitar on Thursday night who played a Talking Heads song for me once. 7. My favorite kilt-wearing bartender, Eric. 8. More Killians, maybe a Corona or seven. 9. Big booths, small booths, or bar seating. 10. The hilarity of trying to walk up and down the narrow flight of stairs to the bathroom while tipsy. 11. Close to the Beck Center for the Arts if you've just seen a show, and close to Cronies if you're looking to bar hop. 12. Really.  Good.  Pasta.  And burgers.  Need I go on?  Love me some Rush Inn."}
{"text":"I have to admit - I wasn't impressed as I stepped into Rush's dark bar. I thought, \"what in the world are people thinking, bringing kids here?!\" First impressions can be really inaccurate - didn't take long for me to realize that Rush Inn was a lot more than a dark bar.   A greeter asked if we were here to eat and then guided us through the bar and into the eating area. Our table looked out on Detroit - the perfect view for a Saturday afternoon. A couple of booths away, a family with three small children enjoyed an early dinner. It was a really nice atmosphere - a surprisingly family-friendly atmosphere.  I knew that Rush Inn had a reputation for great burgers. My wife had already decided to go that route, but I'm not a beef eater. No matter, I found at least half a dozen things if not more that I would like to try. I settled on the Turkey Ruben rollup and homemade kettle chips. She got the 'oh-my-gouda' burger on a pretzel bun and sweet potato fries.   I have to admit that when her burger arrived, I had a few moments of wishing that beef were on my menu. Rarely do restaurants serve thick slices of expensive cheese, yet this burger was definitely big on gouda. It also had several avocado slices - probably at least half of an avocado - in addition to everything else. She announced that \"lady-like\" was not happening and dug in, proclaiming her love for this burger between bites.   Oh, the sweet potato fries were phenomenal. They didn't need any kind of sauce - they were just crispy enough, yet soft and tender without being soggy or limp.  My kettle chips were equally delicious - covered in some kind of ranch seasoning and crispy but not over-done. They provided dill dip but honestly that wasn't necessary.  My turkey Reuben rollup was also excellent. I appreciated the delivery mechanism - rolled up in a piece of aluminum foil - because it meant that I could eat without wearing half of it. Every bite had a good mixture of the ingredients.  Rush Inn earns a 5-star rating for its surprisingly-nice ambiance, diverse menu with seriously delicious food, quick service, and staff that was friendly and responsive.  Note to Physically Challenged Diners:  Rush Inn is in an old building that is not fully accessible. You could probably get a walker and possibly a wheelchair through the bar and to the booths - I'm not positive about the width of the aisles - but the bathroom is down a flight of stairs. As someone who is physically disabled, I recognize how limiting this can be.   Call ahead to make sure you will be able to get to a booth and plan ahead in terms of the bathroom. I'm not taking points off their review because I feel like that is unfair for small businesses that are located in really old buildings. Still, I'd like to see more done about this issue."}
{"text":"Previously I only used to go to Rush Inn for their wings.. and I am just not a wing person. I actually never looked at their menu and when I went there for dinner with one of my girlfriends, I was pleasantly surprised how big it is. Walking into the restaurant in general you think its small but there is actually lots of seating and booths.  Taking a look at the menu there was SO many things that were standing out to me for the perfect bar food. Pierogi sandwiches, Pierogi Paprikash, Burgers and Sandwiches.. oh my. It was hard to decide on an entree so I saw it was taco night and decided to have 1 taco while I think.  The taco's on their taco night is AMAZING!!! Soft but crunchy melt in your mouth shell with flavored chicken or beef and topped with lettuce, cheese and salsa. My girlfriend and I can't stop talking about how good they were. We finally decided on entrees and I chose a burger adding carmelized onions on it. My burger was prepared perfectly and it had great flavor. I ate half of the burger and my fries, which were like matchstick fries.. they were very good.  Our server was great and attentive as well. Will be back to try more of the menu items!"}

{"text":"This is where the actors in plays hang out after shows at the Beck Center. Unfortunately, they forget the play is over. They bring their crazy stage persona to the restaurant and \"act a fool\". The hamburgers, chicken and steak are all good. The fried potato pancake app is a nice change up. This is more of a restaurant than a bar, a good place to grab some food and drink."}
{"text":"I feel like giving my old review one star. What an amateur I was when I started yelping.  Anyhow, I took some out of town friends here on St. Paddy's Day(including a yelper!) to grab a corned beef sammich. My fellow diners had a burger and the pierogi chicken paprikash. The pierogi was a huge hit. My sandwich, however, was somewhat lacking.  It boasted a \"Jameson mustard sauce\" which did not appear on my entree. I let it go since there was commercial mustard at the table. I don't think they always make this dish and it was probably just for the holiday. The bread was store bought rye(Schwebel's maybe? I detected a hint of Akron flour). The beef was pretty bland.   Again, I don't think it's fair to bash a special versus a staple the establishment is known for. Service was decent on a busy day, though the place was only half full. The people watching at about five pm on Detroit was priceless. We were seated right in the window. Many drunken revelers showing off for us like so many exhibitionist zoo gorillas. The booths are very cozy and tall, giving your dining party great privacy. I did order some mozz sticks and onion rings to go for my wife and they were excellent. Overall, a sane alternative to the madness of Irish bars on this drunkiest of days."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! Mostly for the great service! Taylor our server is a pure delight. My husband and I take my elderly father here and she treats him so wonderfully and with respect! We usually come in for a few beers and appetizers. Great food and good craft beer choices. Kim our bartender is also awesome. I appreciate how nice they are to us . I will continue to bring my dad here . Only bad part is bathroom is down a flight of stairs and not easy for some people I'm sure . Thank you Taylor and Kim you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"my go to spot to have a beer. staff is awesome here, always up for a great convo if their not busy. $2.50 pints $1.50 during games. you can't really beat that! always the food here is truly very good.
