{"text":"Before there were several restaurants at the same location but no one did better business than DHABA EXPRESS because of simple reason 'GOOD & FRESH FOOD' at a very REASONABLE PRICE -- i guess thats what we all want. Perfect place for catering and take-outs. Try their - Butter Chicken, Fish Pakora and Tandoori chicken -- Just love it !!! Kheer is also delicious to complement your food but only prepared certain days.  What we need is little more smile and one good fresh air fan to throw the curry smell out."}
{"text":"I went to their location on Bovaird Drive. I went there after seeing the great reviews. The food was horrible! I am not the greatest cook but I could cook better than their food. The tandoori roti was so hard I thought I was going to break a tooth. The mango lassi which was suppose to be sweet so was so salty. I would never go here again or recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible and rude customer service. never steady prices always fluctuating based on mood of the staff.  Never going back!!"}
{"text":"The catering from D-Express was good, the staff was cordial, prompt and well-organized. The selection of malai kofta and saag was finger-licking good. The desert option appeared scrumptious."}
{"text":"Tasty Punjabi food ,delicious...wow! try out their non-veg dishes......"}
{"text":"This place  is not good as what it used to be.  Yesterday got food catered for a party and it was horrible tasting. everything watered down.  Hardly any meat in the dishes. I will avoid this place."}
{"text":"My office is not too far by from this spot so we decided to check out the buffet for lunch. The food is fresh and the price is right at $7.99 for all you can eat buffet.  The fare is Punjabi as you would expect from many restaurants in Brampton, however the food is piping hot and fresh and to be honest, Punjabi food in its self is very heavy so there is only so many helpings you can eat before exploding.  SAVE ROOM FOR THE GAJAR HALWA!"}
