{"text":"This place has changed it's name. The owner makes it seem like it's now an Irish pub but they didn't take the time to change anything else.....the banners are still reading Memphis BBQ style food. 

The place was plain but clean. The beer was cold and a fairly good selection on tap. The ribs were terrible, inedible and very hard and chewy, and they were listed as being the best....far from it, I spit the one I had in a napkin and didn't touch the rest. The perogies were not bad and the sliders were ok too....nothing special, but ok. 

The service was slow and when they asked how the food was, I told them the ribs were not easy to eat and too hard, they told me it's because of the cut....didn't offer to comp since I only touched one, or apologize either.    

This wasn't the worst place I've been to but I would never go back ,and I'm just glad I didn't come without friends."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time.  I had the pulled pork and was happy with it.  The beef brisket was on the dry side.  The portions are a good size, and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Halsey loves it! NASH loves it!
The smoked meat, Tenessee flavour of The Memphis Smokehouse is a winner. Salt fish, pineapple, sliced beef patties with sluce bish, 12 hour brisket and ham, raisins, apricots, nuts. It's not just tropical, it's crucial!"}
{"text":"I love this place but it seems to have changed hands because I'm sitting here overhearing someone who seems to be the new manager entertaining the boys bellied up to the bar and the notion of turning it into yet another Irish pub. So long, best burger I've ever had in Toronto along with food that actually has real flavour! :("}
{"text":"Nothing at all like down home Southern BBQ!

Went to Memphis the other day and had some of the worst BBQ ever! Having lived in the South for the better part of my life, I've come to know what good Mexican, Tex-Mex and BBQ should really taste like.

First, the brisket tasted exactly like a roast, not some 12 hour slow-cooked meal like it was supposed to be. The roasted chicken was also not good and the chicken bucket had batter that tasted like onion ring batter.

Secondly, for the price, you'd expect a higher quality and quantity of food.

My friends were not impressed with this place and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"A friend had a Groupon that he had to use so we went here for dinner tonight. It's located within walking distance from both Sheppard and North York subway stations; it's roughly in the middle of those on Yonge. It was around 7:30 and the place was about half full. We ordered their $44.99 sampler platter so we could try a variety of their meats.

Good:
- Our server was attentive and pleasant, great job
- Salad was reasonably fresh
- Fries were pretty good

Okay:
- Wings were passable, certainly not \"best in the city\" as stated on the menu

Bad:
- Ribs ... like other reviews noted I'm pretty sure they're boiled, not smoked ... perhaps thrown into some sort of smoker briefly after they're cooked but certainly not smoked over a long period of time, which is disappointing for a place with \"smoke house\" in its name
- The chicken was dry and had very little taste, also not at all \"smoked\" like it says on the menu
- The \"pulled pork\" was just ... wrong. It looked more like a small hunk of pork, coated in sauce, that someone had stabbed with a fork a few times ... also, it wasn't hot, it was room temperature

Overall we got decent quantity but not fantastic quality. If you have a coupon it might be worth it, but there are much tastier options in Toronto."}
{"text":"this was ok

--- SUMMARY ---

Plus's : good place to hang out, decent food, 

Minus's: sitting on the patio means breathing all the car exhaust from the cars on Yonge street

--- MORE DETAILS --- 

we choose a platter for two... it consisted of:

very tender chicken (i picked it up and a piece of meat fell off - SO TENDER) 

first time i had cornbread - it looked burnt on the bottom, so i just ate the top part not bad (it wouldn't' be my first choice) 

pulled pork was ok 

chicken wings were fairly good

beef brisket was pretty good.. 

ribs were kinda dry... in the end everything kinda tasted the same.

fries were good - not too salty"}
{"text":"stepping in, the restaurant itself is nice, there are booths or table seating indoors. the main window is a garage front that opens into the patio area facing yonge st. 

interior has exposed beam ceilings and there's many nostalgic memorabilia decorated throughout. 


we ordered a couple of things from the menu

1. spaghetti with beef brisket - yeah i know an experimental dish but i was feeling like spaghetti and if the brisket was good--  you know that would been amazing. unfortunately the brisket was covered in tomato sauce so I couldn't taste it in it's full glory or not..  

2. pulled pork sandwich - what was odd though we requested the pulled pork sandwich not have any sauce on it, it tasted boiled not smoked?  anyways the sauce on the side was quite tasty and tangy. I liked the sauce and never had anything like it. But the pork was not smoked.

this place didn't deliver the goods unfortunately."}
{"text":"YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AVOID!
Where to begin.... First off, this is not a real smoked meat joint! 
It takes very little experience and few taste buds to understand the difference between real smoked meat and smoke flavor added.

Take a cut into the meat, a quick glance will tell you everything,you are looking  to see if you can see a \"pinkish ring\" around the outer circumference of your meat known as the SMOKE RING and in the case of  Memphis Style.. it doesnt exist!
We had a platter known as \"around the world\" which gives you a sampling of all the meats on the menu. What a disappointment!!!
Boiled tips were just gross, the brisket was a dry tasteless piece of leather, the chicken was from a steamer type cooker the skin was soft and rubbery, the pulled pork was hands down the worst pulled pork I have ever had!

I think that this place has been sold to people that have zero knowledge of what they are doing and it shows

I am sorry I went (and brought a group with me) and no one that went will ever go back either!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! Been here before but  nothing like the last time. Grilled Chicken salad was horrible, cold chicken, more like deli-style chicken. Pulled pork was also cold saugy and fatty. Salad was more yellow than green. Coleslaw was just aweful. The only half decent item was the smoked wings. They were good but looked like they use low quality wings because the inside were slightly brown."}
{"text":"Don't get the hate. It's a decent place. Especially much more fun on the patio in summer. A tad much for lunch specials. 
Love their cornbread"}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than 1 star... this place owes me a few stars, in fact!
Outrageous prices for THE worst BBQ fare I've ever had. I DO love good BBQ but I am not being snobby, this place is really, really bad! Like Swiss Chalet and Baton Rouge are even better for ribs, etc.
I spent a fortune here, and even gave them a 2nd try, but it's just bad! 
Dry, tasteless, just really awful!
Run for your life - don't go!"}
{"text":"This ain't BBQ, let alone Memphis BBQ.

I've been to Memphis and I ate disgusting portions of BBQ while I was there and even the crappiest of them was infinitely better than this place. At the very least they were all genuine smoke joints.

Like Greg B and James K before me have stated, this is not real BBQ and certainly not anything resembling meat that's been smoked low and slow.

The pulled pork sammy was bland and simply tasted like BBQ sauce. Same thing with my side of beans. They could very well have been Heinz, straight out of the can. And, similarly, I'm sure my iced tea was a Liptons product. So sad.

There's really nothing redeeming about this place whatsoever and it was a long haul to get there from my place in East York, so a big screw you to Memphis Smoke House."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place but I really..don't
We sat on the patio and it boasted \"authentic\" memphis style bbq.  
...but then again, what place doesn't try to boast authenticity nowadays?

Anyways, we ordered a platter between the two of us and it was a MASSIVE amount of food.  But none of the food was especially good.  The platter was about 35$ and came with wings, ribs, shortribs, pulled pork, fries, cornbread, baked beans and coleslaw.
Sounds like a dream platter, no?  But everything was so... like I could have made it myself better.
All the meat was dry and the best meat was the wings, but that was even fairly average.

they do have free refills on drinks and the server was rather attentive and nice.  but the food and the atmosphere doesn't cut it for me to want to come back."}
{"text":"I would never go out of my way to purposely come here for dinner. I don't even know why I would come here unless someone had a groupon, oh right - that's why we were there.

I ordered the ribs and wings combo. Ribs were stringy and dry. The wings were cold and overly sauce. The baked beans were also cold with oil floating on top and the coleslaw was drenched in white vinegar. The small piece of corn bread tasted like it was microwaved in old butter and it crumbled like sand when ate some. But the fries were good. The bill came to $70 for the two of us - way over priced for the sub par food. I don't even know where the smoked part was in the food and should not be called a smoke house.

The service was less than average and the wait staff seemed like they didn't like their jobs. I couldn't finish my food and they asked me if I wanted to take the rest home. I said \"hell no\". The only saving grace was alcohol. Beer makes me happy."}
{"text":"The staff was very courteous and I like the atmosphere, but the food left something to be desired. I'm not a huge \"smoked meat\" guy, but my understanding was the meat should be especially tender. I found the chicken and ribs both too be surprisingly and undeliciously dry. 

It's a shame because I had high hopes going in"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on southern style food or smoked meats. So I'm reviewing this place in comparison to other chicken/ribs places. I've ben here a few times about 2 years ago with groupons and again now with groupons. 

To start, this is a great location. Just a short walk from subway. That's always a plus for me, and unfortunately just about the only positive thing I have to say. My experience was't very positive about 2 years ago. But it wasn't terrible either. 

First of all, for a smoke house, I can't distinguish any difference when compared to other chicken and ribs place. Of the 3-4 times I've been here, I ordered ALL their meat items at least once. The chicken tastes more or less like what you'd expect grilled chicken to taste. The ribs tastes like any other place. The wings are small and again, tastes like any other place. Pulled pork tastes lik...pulled pork. Don't get me wrong. It's delicious. I just don't feel the \"smoked\" part. 

Second of all, for the portions you get, it's a little pricey. Even with a groupon, I feel I barely got my money's worth. If you read my reviews, you'll know price is a deal breaker for me. When I walk into a so called \"Smoke House\" and pay a premium over other chicken/ribs place, I expect something out of the ordinary. I ordered a their 3 color mushroom fetticuini pasta and it barely had any ingredients aside from pasta. Perhaps it's because I'm using a groupon that they've decided to screw me in portions? The chicken is the only thing that seems like the right size. When I ordered ribs + wings combo, we got 6 small wings and 4 ribs pieces. That's not even half a rack. A half rack is usually 5-6 pieces. And I also noted that compared to other places, there's less meat on these pieces. The small bowl of beans, coleslaw and a piece of cornbread doesn't come close to compensating for the lack of meat. If you have a groupon and is afraid of shrinkage, get the CHICKEN. 1/4 or 1/2 chicken will generally be the same size.

For those who care about service (I don't), it's fine. Nothing really bad or good happened. 

Do I regret coming here? No becaue I had a groupon and I love trying new places. With the groupon, I feel the place is barely ok in terms of price. Without a groupon, I'd probably never come here. If you live in the area, I'd say you have better options."}
{"text":"To call them \"Incompetent\" would be a compliment. Here goes.

Décor was OK. The only negative we saw was, no BBQ sauce bottles on the tables. BBQ places ALWAYS have the bottles on the tables.

Most of the wait staff do not speak English. Tried to ask about a menu item (we TRIED to inquire about the 3 sauces), guy couldn't answer. Started on some explanation of \"it's the city it came from\"... what? Ordered soft drinks, which never came, instead Mr. Engrish-as-a-2nd-Language promptly brought us ice water with lemon wedges. The table next to us also had water, and were served their beer as they were almost finished their meals! We never got the drinks we ordered, ever. Didn't show up on the bill either so at least Mr. Engrish got that right.

The coleslaw was awful. It was totally inedible. Basically a tiny ball of shredded cabbage seasoned with vinegar. Ugh.

The pulled pork was NOT smoked. I didn't see any signs of smoke (no smoke ring, no bark), it was just a tasteless, uniform pinkish-grey pile of mush. If not for the sauce (which wasn't very good either), it would have no flavour at all.

The ribs were OK, they were actually smoked.. However, Mr. Engrish asked us if we wanted our ribs wet or dry. We ordered wet. We got dry. And a tiny ramekin of sauce that was not enough for the ribs.

Beans weren't very good either. Tasted like they went from can to ramekin to microwave to customer.

Fries were the only strong suit. Hard to screw those up, they were quite good. Lightly salted, crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. The fries should not be the highlight of the meal but at this place, they were.

And here's the best part -- as we were getting up to leave, the only English speaking waiter came over to ask us how was our meal was. Well, my wife is from the South and she told him it sucked and why. He apologized and had the nerve to say \"I've never heard any complaints before\"... so he's in denial about how bad the food is, or he's never read Yelp.... wow. If a customer complains you apologize and that's it. You don't brush it off like he did.

Long story short, any national BBQ chain in the U.S. (Smokey Bones, Famous Dave's, etc) whups these guys. Memphis Style's food sucks, and their service sucks. You can't deny the fact that
sometimes the chains beat the local independents... local doesn't always mean better. No BBQ chain in the U.S. would have such incompetent waitstaff serve such dreck. Epic fail."}
{"text":"Not surprisingly, this place is closed... Or is it? 

An Irish pub occupies the space and the switch was literally and figuratively done overnight. In fact, some of the signs like having \"the best smoked ribs\" are still hanging.

Turned off by the previous restaurant iteration, I'm not planning on checking out the \"Irish pub\".  I'll stick with The Firkin just a few a little bit south."}
{"text":"Contrary to the other reviews, I like this place. It's pretentious and it makes no sense in that the Memphis theme has no connection to the people running the place, but the food was good and the beer was cheap.

We had rib special--a full rack for $17--and two buckets of five Coors for $18. Can't go wrong. The ribs were good. No complaints.

The soundtrack was a problem, consisting of ten songs played over and over and over again.

This place no longer has any kind of authentic vibe--take the guitars off the wall and lose the soundtrack and stop pretending it's a southern bbq place--and it would be a plain ol' decent place to eat."}
{"text":"***AVOID*** This is NOT barbecue (The Stockyards is what you're looking for. Its on St. Clair just west of Bathurst, south side.) The rib tips were boiled and maybe grilled briefly over hickory but I say even that's a stretch of the imagination. The sauce (Stockyards!) was pretty bland. Pulled pork was bland, dry and smokeless. Ice tea wasn't even authentic homemade (Stockyards!) How far you've fallen Memphis Style."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch the other day, hoping to find a really good smoklehouse I didn't have to leave town for (hillbilly heaven). 
For me the sign of a good smokehouse is that I actually smell hickory or some sort of smoke. Didnt smell any here , so I was expecting average toronto quality bbq fare. 
Luckily the food I ordered was above average (its no beale street smokehouse though). On the bright side the service was really good and the one  server working the patio was really quick and very helpful. 
     I had the pulled pork sandwich and cornbread. The pulled pork was ok, but what stopped it from being great was too much bbq sauce and fried onions. This is a simple sandwich that shouldn't need too much garnish if the meat is done right. The cornbread was delicious, moist instead of crumbly and a little sweet.
I might go back here to try the other menu items or if I feel the need for some bbq while I am uptown."}
{"text":"Ate here recently and everything was just ok, nothing special, almost on the bland side. Something just wasn't quite right with the food, but I can't put my finger on it. Taste was just off. The portions were ok -  regular for a BBQ place with ribs and meats. 

The service was impeccable and fast. The decor and atmosphere is great. 
Too bad, the most important aspect is lacking: the food.
unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I went after the Smoke House Platter (small) with a friend which had a bit of everything (chicken wings, ribs, riblets, chicken legs, etc.) and suffice to say, it was super-filling!  After a while though, the food starts to taste the same... Beer on tap was good (I had a Stella)."}
{"text":"Although Memphis Smoke House is likely not for everyone, it is a perfect cozy and local venue for my husband and I. Personally, I am on a continual quest to find a close place with just the right vibe, smell, and delicious frozen drinks (in this case, 8-10 oz. strawberry margaritas). This place scores high on all those points.

Vibe - unpretentious, clean, friendly; relaxed (no worries about being shooed away); and great music (muddy waters meets blues brothers)

Smell - hickory, slow-roasted with hints of garlic (most overwhelming red meat smells drive me away)

Food - I ordered the light-weight ribs and my husband ordered a wings/ribs combo. We both found our meat fell right off the bone and something especially wonderful to me was that I was able to order dry ribs with BBQ sauce on the side. The beans and cornbread were amazing too.

We'll be back!"}
