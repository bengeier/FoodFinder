{"text":"This was my first time having Filipino food outside of family gatherings and parties and I must say, it tasted home-made and delicious.  The price is VERY reasonable and the restaurant has a diner-style feel, casual and relaxed.  We went there mid-afternoon, so between lunch and dinner and there was much variety.  They kept bringing out more fresh food and refilling the buffet.  

Drinks are not included in the buffet price but the per person price is pretty good to begin with so no complaints there.  

There is karaoke and live music at night.

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We opted for the two dishes with rice ($7.00). This place was just 1.2 miles away from our Marriott hotel in Brampton. We had the Kare Kare and pork asado. The Kare Kare needed a little thickness to the sauce so I would recommend that they add more peanut butter. The pork asado was fine and you can serve yourself so we got good sized servings. We noticed that everyone else got the buffet ($10.00) and that would just be way too much food. I enjoyed eating off of dinner plates, using silverware and drinking out of a wine glass - all nice touches. The restaurant has flat screens, a high ceiling and is spacious. The folks are friendly as well. Oh, they also have used Filipino DVDs for just one dollar."}

Stainless-steel basins keep an array of Filipino dishes warm at Yatco Filipino Restaurant's buffet. The mechado's tomato-based gravy infuses tender chunks of beef with flavor, and the bicol express's morsels of pork simmer in a spicy coconut sauce. The kitchen crew tosses the fresh noodles of pancit palabok in a prawn gravy and threads beef onto sticks before searing them for Filipino-style barbecue. 

Diners enjoy their self-loaded plates at casual tables beneath high ceilings, watching The Filipino Channel on the television or waiting for turns at karaoke during evening visits. Customers can also take advantage of the wireless Internet access to research how much time they saved by eating at Yatco rather than swimming to Manila for dinner
