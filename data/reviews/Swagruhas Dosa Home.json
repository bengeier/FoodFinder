{"text":"Weekday late lunch so the service was good, food portions were fair and best of all I could actually taste flavours!  Usually don't eat out because I can taste the baking soda and oil and have terrible heartburn even hours later.  Will come back soon"}
{"text":"I decided to write a review for this place the second I had the first bite of my chilli fritters. It's been a while since I've tasted food so close to authentic, so close to the taste back home! Good dosas and good vada sambar. My first visit here but definitely won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon after visiting a few friends. Service was quite slow as there was only one server. But the wait was worth it. The masala dosas were piping hot and the potato innards were mighty fresh. A side of masala chai went down well after the dosa. Check this place out when you have a craving for dosas."}
{"text":"We were feeling like having a Dosa and I have been seeing the sign on the road saying more than 40 types of dosa, so we went to check it out . After reading their menu I was very intrigued on the choices of Dosa they provided. 

The restaurant has a good number of seatings. The service was quick and the lady was very friendly. 

Choices...Choices...Foodwise, I choose Palak (Spinach) Paneer Masala Rava Dosa - This Dosa was huge and fully stuffed with cooked palak and paneer with special herbs and spices stuffed with curried potato masala. The Dosa were exceptionally good and fresh as well as crispy. The Chutneys (sauces) were good too.

Overall, the experience was quite good and satisfying."}
{"text":"First Star: This place is lightning quick! I went in, ordered a dosa (from their 153 choices - it's not really that exact number, but there are a lot of choices), paid, went to the washroom and by the time I got out Kris U was standing there holding my bag of dosa.

I had to get it to go as I was on my way out of the country and my flight was departing in 2 hours, which brings me to the Second Star: it's proximity to the airport was perfect for my needs.

Third Star: it's all about legit-ness. I walked in and was greeted by what I'm pretty sure is a family owned and operated business with lots of folks that appeared to be regulars.

Fourth Star: it was goooooooood. I chose a spicy masala dosa and really enjoyed it. Keep in mind though; Denver doesn't do dosa so I was happy to have it in any form. 

Bonus: Customs allowed me to take my dosa through and eat it while waiting for my plane. 
Not-so-bonus: the stink eye my fellow travelers waged upon me for my strong-smelling eats."}
{"text":"The price for the food you eat makes it the no.1 south indian restaurant in my list. Just love their sambar and white chitney and amazing staff"}
{"text":"This is my favourite dosa spot. The paper masala dosa and Rava onion masala dosa are phenomenal. I would recommend this place over guru Lakshmi or saravana bhavan any day. I always drive down from downtown to swagruhas to satisfy my dosa craving and every time I leave wishing there was a place closer. Completely worth the 30 min drive."}
{"text":"A great place for Dosa's. Been to Toronto twice in a month and this place did not disappoint in the taste of Dosa's. The chutney's were also good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a newer plaza but I wouldn't come here for the ambiance. There is plenty of seating here. There were quite a few people on a Wednesday night. They seemed to have only a couple of staff in the front but the service was very fast. We seated ourselves and the waitress came within a few mins to serve us water and take our orders. 

I was really hungry and I really liked the speed of their service. They were quick to bring out our appetizers - Idli and vada combo. You can add an extra idli or vada to it as well. I ordered the ghee paper dosa and my husband got the kara masala dosa. I really liked the taste and portion size. The dosa was crisp and light but a bit on the saltier side. I found myself drinking a lot of water. The chutneys were really good and tasted fresh. 

I would definitely come back here. The pricing is very reasonable and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect Dosa at a Punjab Business Centre but you'll be surprised. The Dosas and the Idlys are pretty good. There are better places out there (Grihalakshmi, Sarvanna Bhavan) in Toronto but this one will satisfy your craving for some good Dosa. The pricing is pretty good as compared to some of the other restaurants. The servers are friendly but they did forget my order for the dessert. Try out the Mango Lassi - it's pretty good. I love the fact they have a open Handwash area. Makes it much more cleaner. Ask for the special of the day. My wife loves Paper Dosa and she found it pretty good. Overall, a good place if you insist on having a Dosa for a bite!"}
{"text":"Somehow I end up staying at a Toronto airport hotel every few years and I always look forward to coming here when I do. They do great South Indian food and the dosa's are killer."}
{"text":"We drove 30 minutes to this place and found absolutely delicious south Indian food. 
Dahi wada was excellent balance between all ingredients 
Mango lassi was good. Onion rawa masala disa was the best. 
Onion uthapam not good. Very little onion and too thick. 

Overall good experience. 

Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Note:  This place is Vegetarian.  I didn't really know that until I got there.

Just North of the International Centre, this resto is in a non-shabby, relatively new plaza in Malton...that actually looks like Brampton!

Restaurant itself is much bigger than it looks, quite deep.  And it has a hand washing station.  Not sure if that was meant for both customers and workers.

Menu is pretty straight-forward with a one-line description.  No photos though, so either ask questions or just be open to experience new things!

I had half of the Paneer Onion Masala Dosa & the Chetinnad Masala Dosa, both were really good and came with 3 chutneys (orange-coloured, coconut, & coriander) + sambar.  I would say pretty comparable to Guru Lukshmi, slightly greasier, sambar was a bit too salty, & not as extensive of a menu.  Both Dosa were under $12.  Also had a really good Mango Lassi, under $4.

A Bollywood movie/music video was playing in the background, but not blasting.  Atmosphere was actually surprisingly quiet and calm!  A welcomed change to a busy day.  There were only a few tables of dine-in, as opposed to Guru which is always slammed!

Would definitely recommend if you're in the area and feeling like Dosa."}
{"text":"Decided to visit Swagruhas Dosa Home after seeing the roadside signs for a few weeks.
I was overwhelmed by the amount of choices on the menu as it is quite a large one.

I found their pooris to be quite greasy, but tasted just like the ones my grandfather used to make. So, a nice reminder of my youth.

The dosa was yummy, filled with a very good potato puree. Good spice level. However, the onions were fully raw and falling everywhere. They were unnecessary in my opinion and I will remember that the next time I order.

The restaurant itself, as others have stated, is not a show piece. But its plenty big, with 2 sinks available for hand washing."}
