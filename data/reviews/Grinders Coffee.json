{"text":"Love to walk up here and pickup some coffee on the weekends. Always friendly staff and nice to find a small roaster."}
{"text":"I found this location using Yelp, and was really excited to try it out as a new study spot. It's a lot closer to me, and easier to go here than travel to a downtown joint. However, the barista working didn't even acknowledge me until I reached the register and she finished the drink for a regular standing nearby. She then just asked for my order, and I informed her it was my first time, and was looking for a recommendation. She gave me one, but made no attempt to connect on a relational level, not even taking my name for the order. She directed me to the Viennese Mocha, which was incredible - if I came back it would definitely be for the coffee. I also ordered a breakfast sandwich, which was nothing memorable. I wouldn't get it again - if anything, I would try a pastry; they had a decent selection and they all looked incredible. Anyways, interesting atmosphere, and had the service been better, I would definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I had a dark roast over ice with light soy milk because I am on a no sugar or sweets fast and it was pretty good.  I really wanted to try their banana cream latte, but could not have the sugar. Oh well, I will try to go back when I can enjoy some sweets and try their flavored lattes and pastries. 

The customer service was stellar and the inside of the coffee shop was filled with unique trinkets, etc."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great coffee then you got to try Grinders! I and my husband brought mocha madness and marvelous mango. They were phenomenal. We will be back again to try other drinks on the vast menu. owner was as SWEET as the coffee he sells."}
{"text":"Grinder's is a great little coffee shop in the Sunnyslope district.  Each week I purchase my two pounds of coffee that has been roasted in their shop (the roaster is part of the decor).  The staff is always friendly and lets me know what is the best roast that week.  Since my tastes change, sometimes going for the super dark roast or perhaps a lighter flavor the next week, they help me pick out the best bean.
This little shop is full of locals and in the afternoon, be prepared for the Sunnyslope High School crowd.  The staff is sometimes a bit slow getting out orders, but they make up for it with friendly service and a great product. Another place where they get to know their customers by their names!"}
{"text":"Grest coffee and friendly service! I'm excited to make this spot one of my new regular places!"}
{"text":"First coffee shop I ever went to that \"ran out of coffee.\" After months frequenting this place since I moved into the neighborhood, I won't be back. You just made the case for Corporate America. #TeamStarbucks"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place ever since I drove past it on an exploratory drive through the Sunnyslope area.  Based on it's location, it seemed like it might be less pretentious than some of it's other centrally-located peers.  After several visits, I am glad to give it five stars for being one of my favorite coffee shops in the Phoenix area.

On my first visit here, I immediately noticed two things: 1) the roasting equipment and raw beans displayed prominently, indicating that they did indeed roast their own beans and 2) the prices, which are lower than the average coffee shop (I'm thinking Starbucks, which came to prominence with a reputation for high prices but has really fallen into the middle of the pack compared with the better local places that have cropped up) and far lower than most gourmet shops.  True, you're not getting a pour over for each cup, but you know that it was freshly roasted (and ground) and it's less than $2 a cup.  The beans are the real deal, though: $10.95/lb for freshly roasted, delicious coffee beans?  I know some good places for coffee but none of them can even touch that price, most hovering closer to $15/16 per lb.

Although I usually go for regular coffee when exploring a new place, I decided to get a latte on that first trip visit, which did not disappoint - good smooth espresso flavor and the right ratio of milk for me.  The next time that I stopped in, I asked a few questions about the beans and bought a cup of coffee.  After some debate, I went with their Bold roast, which I later found out is also their espresso roast.  While it makes for a good espresso, I found it fairly light for a \"bold\" cup of coffee, and after adding just a splash of cream it tasted somewhat watered down.  In the future I'd probably go with one of their other roasts, particularly the Double French.  This is a mix between their dark Sumatra roast and Tanzanian peaberry.  I was a little concerned when I purchased it, as the barista told me to \"wait for the oils to come out on the beans.\" Though I don't know a ton about coffee, one of the things I thought I knew was that oily beans = ruined beans, but after making it at home on a French press, it quickly entered my upper echelon of coffees.  I also picked up some single source Guatemalan while I was there, a brighter and somewhat less flavorful roast, but still excellent.

Compared to many of the other places in town, this place is perhaps a bit dumpy, but it's got good character and the baristas are super friendly and helpful.  They display art in the store and even have a special night for it each month (Second Saturdays?)  It's also very quiet and has outdoor tables, so I could imagine getting some work done there unlike more popular and louder shops.  I'll definitely be getting beans and drinks from this place in the future."}
{"text":"I walked {first time here} and they have local art on the wall AND a REAL COFFEE GRINDER in the seating area. It smells like warm coffee like a smooth warm blanket of ecstatic joy. This is my now go to place for liquid comfort food. Music is great old school rock ( led zeplin and the like \" clasic\" category) and the couch. 

Will highly recommend this place to all who live around here."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have never been disappointed with my coffees and lattes. All expertly made with quality beans, and not super caffeinated with a side of jitters like you get at Starbucks. Nice enough patio, but something about the layout of the inside is not feng shui, could be a little cozier. I wish that they had a drive through, because then I'd be there all the time!"}
{"text":"It's a sandwich. Bread. Meat. Condiments. Lettuce. Tomatoe, etc. I could have made it at home, but I'm glad I didn't!

As soon as I walked into the door, I was pleasantly greeted by the owners as well as the employees. The morning had been a particularly difficult one and walking into the clean, well adorned establishment was like walking into an oasis filled with happiness and joy as we acknowledged one another. I ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough with roasted red bell peppers, lettuce, mayo with a hint of horseradish, cucumbers and more. Then they carefully toasted this masterful creation releasing a pleasant smell reminiscent of a sandwich prepared at home.  When ready, it was presented on a real plate by a real person in a genuine manner. Memory of it's golden brown goodness still makes my mouth water some 24 hours later. The last bite was just as wonderful as the first. Soon, the woes of the morning quickly vanished and my chi was restored. Thank you Grinders for providing a nice respite for all these years, but especially on this day. Your sandwich was much more than just a sandwich, it was an experience I will not forget and will soon repeat!"}
{"text":"The crew at Grinders is very friendly. They learn your name, greet you by your name when you enter, and ask if you'd like your usual. I usually arrive as a morning stop on my way to work, and there's a group of regulars lounging there which adds to the friendly atmosphere. 

The coffee is great and it's awesome to see the collection of wares from the local artists."}
{"text":"Great place!  I have been coming here after morning runs for years.  Coffee is always fresh, and they usually have a wonderful assortment of baked goods if you need something sweet.  The crowd is always friendly, and the service is stellar."}
{"text":"I had never been here before and the barista helped me pick an Amazing iced caramel soy latte. It was delicious and he was super friendly. The atmosphere carries good tunes and a cool casual atmosphere. :)."}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses. Grinders has great coffee and amazing people working there. I always get an iced coconut latte."}
{"text":"Man, I'm loving this place. I've gone here almost everyday this week because it is in between my apartment and my school. I've loved every second I've been in there. The coffee is awesome, the staff is even better. The music is always playing (with good tunes, mind you) I even have had random conversations with people. I will be here every time I need to get out of the house and work. Grinder's wins in my book."}
{"text":"Smooth coffee and friendly service. I'll. take this over Starbucks any day of the week."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and they bring your drinks out to you.  The artwork and jewelry by local artists is usually quite good, and something I'd consider buying if I had the spare money.

Their coffee has a great taste, much better than Starbucks, and I like putting money into small businesses instead of the Wal-Marts of the coffee world.  They make my finicky customized orders with no issue and I always prefer to visit them rather than a Starbucks, but I have to hold a star back due to their pretty limited hours.  I'd like to visit them more often, but they're usually closed by the time I'm in the area (as in, mid-afternoon)."}
{"text":"Cute industrial coffee shop.... needed a break from Starbucks. Got the caramel creamer it was very good slightly on the sweet side... the woman who took my order was super sweet and service was excellent! Close to my work and my new spot!"}
{"text":"I only pay for things that I like a lot. If an experience is not much better than making food or drink at home, why pay the premium? Grinders is one of those places that has figured out a way to bring all of the elements together to create the perfect flavor storm in a cup. The crazy part is that they charge the same or less than many other coffee spots. I am glad that the best spot in town is near my home."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Not horrible.  Service was fine.  Had a latte but really it just tasted like milk."}
{"text":"a nice place. kind of amateur service, but i'm sure with experience they'll improve by leaps and bounds. mediocre espresso and milk, but a nice atmosphere. i wouldn't make the drive if you're not already in the neighborhood, but i'm sure it's an asset to the area nevertheless."}
{"text":"on aug 26,2015
i went to this coffee shop yesterday for the first time 
and ordered coffee, bagel and they only gave my coffee and i had to ask the girl 3 times to give my bagel i purchase and the whole time i was waiting for my coffee and bagel she kept touching her nose the whole time didnt was she hands or put gloves or anything,
so today i called and talked with the manager and told him what happen he said he will take care of it and knows the girl of who it is ,
i said i wanted to call you to not file a complaint"}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere. Nothing extravagant. Looks like the owners  grinder collection on display and fresh beans in boxes and bags. Barista was pretty fantastic, some of her own artwork hung on the walls and she had witty answers to our questions. I tried the vinese mocha latte, because if it has an odd name, I will probably try it (; the flavor is sold: cinnamon, mocha, almond and espresso. Very tasty. I am not usually a huge fan of mocha, but I could definitely drink this. (:"}
{"text":"The best fricken caramel macchiato! Love their service, always friendly."}
{"text":"I always see this place on my way to work, but it kindof looks like a Starbucks from the street. I needed my coffee fix this morning; however and the office foldgers was not going to cut it (best part of waking up my ass), so I stopped in.

This place is actually really cool. Flyers for local events posted, ratty comfortable looking furniture, completely unpretentious.

I ordered my cafe americano from a man behing the counter with Sammy Haggar curls and a rad scar on his cheek. I thought of him as a kind pirate. 

My drink was up in no time flat and I am sipping it right now at work and in heaven. I know a cafe americano doesn't have that many ingredients and is difficult to screw up...but most places I go have terrible burned espresso which they graciously water down hardcore so that I can't taste it as much. This stuff is flavorful yet smooth. I will be back tomorrow morning for a cup maybe give myself enough time to try a pastry and test those chairs."}
{"text":"Grinders is my new coffee find for the week - this time out in the Sunnyslope District. Unassumingly placed in a strip mall (I guess this phrase should just be a given in Phoenix), it's actually pretty comfortable inside. Not a large space, but there are couches and other living room furniture, free wi-fi, and in-house roasted beans for sale. 

Service was really friendly, and I wavered between getting a hot or iced soy latte. I ended up getting it iced, which probably wasn't the best idea, because it was only ok. Since I heard Grinders made great coffee, I'll give the barrista the benefit of the doubt and order a hot one next time, just so I can make a sound judgment.  

They also close up shop pretty early - 7 or 6 pm, given the day of the week, which is too bad. I'm sure there's a lot of folks in the neighborhood who would make it a local hangout if it stayed open longer.

3 stars for now, maybe more after hot latte time.

---------

Note: The map is way off. Grinders is at the corner of Central and Dunlap."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. The coffee is good but the scones are absolutely AMAZING. The owner told me they are made each morning, so the batches are small. Glad to support a locally owned business."}
{"text":"What a nice family owned and run shop. They have the big roasting machine where they roast all their beans weekly. Their Mocha Frappe is amazing! They also offer vegan bakery options for those who need them. Although they are vegan, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.

I'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...

The music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.

The coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.

There's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.

There's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.

A lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.

Early in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. 

Ordinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.

There's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. 

I can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.

Grinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there. LAME!"}
{"text":"They seemed to offer really good tasting espresso drinks here with not too much milk. They looked like they had a steady flow of regulars"}
{"text":"I ran over to this location because I needed to do some computer work before a local doctors appointment. It is truly a hidden gem! Reminds me of the local coffee shops in NJ. Dive bar and diner feel in a coffee shop.

The woman working the register was very sweet and knowledgable about the coffee beans. She answered all and any questions I had and also asked me how much almond milk I'd like in my coffee which is surprising because I've noticed a lot of coffee shops in the valley just add what they think is best. I chose the coffee of the day which was their Heavenly Roast and it is very smooth and fresh. 

I live about 15 minutes away from here but I doubt this will be my last stop in!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Grinders since it opened.  I remember when it was just the owner and one or two others.  They are absolutely friendly,  professional and make extremely tasty beverages.  I would honestly recommend anything on the menu!  There are certain times of the day when it gets a bit busy (morning and lunch rush), so plan accordingly.   Thank you for bringing a treat to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ordered a triple Americano. I was impressed by the fact that it only cost $3.05 for a triple. Especially when places like Lux or Lola are $3 for a single. But then I found out why. The triple Americano was served in a 12oz cup and was really weak for being a triple. And while it was hot, it didn't seem as hot as it should have been. I am concluding that either my Americano did not have a triple shot OR there was too much water. I'm leaning toward the former given that even a REAL 12oz triple shot would taste stronger despite the 12oz cup. 

On top of this, when I asked the woman at the counter if the drink was mine or not, she had to ask the barista but only after she put her hand all over the cup and even the lid. Who does that?

She was very talkative but casually mentioned that their old barista was fired, yes fired. I did not inquire about the old barista, and didn't even know there should be an old barista, let alone thought I needed to know why they were no longer there. Professional, much?

I'm hoping this was just a bad first experience so I will go back because it's the only local coffeehouse by my work that isn't Starbucks or fast food. But if my next trip is like this first one, it will be my last."}
{"text":"I needed a caffeine fix, and love to support and try out local/family-owned businesses.  Found this place not too far from where my hotel was and thought I'd give it a shot.  Overall it's a cute little cafe with friendly service.  I don't like my coffee too sweet (unless it's Vietnamese iced coffee...that's a category all on it's own!), so I talked to the barista for awhile to get the right drink.  He was super nice and ended up customizing a drink for me, which I really appreciated, but the drink still ended up way too sweet for my liking.

I would consider going back to give it another shot the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great White Chocolate Mocha.  Perfect balance of coffee and white chocolate.   White chocolate was not so overpowering where you could still get that coffee kick we need.  Great place....would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere, different from most coffee shops. They roast their beans every 3 days. This shop may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it has character."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. Looks a bit cramped. Prices are inexpensive, less then Starbucks and Dutch Bros. There are three sizes: short, tall, and serious. Got the caramel mocha over ice. Good taste, not too sweet, just right. Overall, the experience was good. The barista was nice. Probably will come back if I'm on that side of town. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Coffee and service is great. The location is good since there aren't a lot of other coffee shops near here. It would be nice if they were open late though. Not a big fan of the decor - feels more like a waiting room than a place you want to hang out."}
{"text":"The place is small but, I see it as cozy. There is also outside seating that is great to enjoy on a beautiful day or evening. 

The owner waited on me. And made me the best Viennese Mocha, I 
think is possible. Excellent to the last drop! I learned they roast and blend their own beans. Well someone here knows what they are doing because this was the smoothest coffee drink at a coffeehouse I think I have yet to have. And hey ... I lived in Seattle for almost twenty years I have been to some coffeehouses, let me tell ya! 

I went to their website www.GrindersCoffeeCo.com 
It's a great little website. It explains the place well  ,as well as their coffee and I also learned they have a rotating art showing on the walls that change the 1st Saturday of each month and jazz or  blues playing on the patio the 2nd Saturday of each month. 

I might just be there for this first Music night in 2010. Say Hi if you see me around there getting my caffeine buzz on anytime.
I'll try it again before I give them a five star rating."}
{"text":"I'm just giving them a 4 star review because the coffee is great. To the young barista with the hat on, you are in desperate need of a hug. Please remember that you work in the service industry. I know people have bad days but you sir have a bad attitude all the time. Be nice to your coworkers and be nice to the people you serve. Unless they're being jerks like you. Then be an ass. But then again, you already know how to be one."}
{"text":"I think I'm spoiled by the number of solid coffee shops in the Tempe area.  Grinders is the best coffee shop that is on my very direct path to work, but if any of my usual hotspots were equally as convenient, I'd head to them instead.

Pros - The coffee is pretty good, it's locally owned, there are recurrent characters every morning no matter what, and their support of other local business and artists is commendable.  

Cons - For some reason I never get a very friendly vibe when I'm there, the facility is kind of small and I feel like it lacks character, and...it just lacks that little extra.

We'll see, maybe I'm tarnished by the fact that I stop in here before work every morning and it's ME that isn't in a friendly mood.  Then I just thought about my review for D-Lish in Scottsdale...."}
{"text":"Outstanding coffee and incredibly sweet earth child barista (don't think I'm allowed to say \"hippy chick\").  And the first time I had their iced mocha (I think triple shot espresso) I exclaimed \"wow, that's damn fine coffee\".  Wish it wasn't 20 miles from my house!

They need to get a new couch or two in there.   But the coffee was so damn good I'd forgive them anything."}
{"text":"Good coffee, wonderful aroma..a lot of noise.

I went here a few times while my sister was in the hospital across the street. As mentioned previously everything was great (good seating, good people) until the operated the roaster. Since my main purpose frequenting coffee houses is to work (novelist) the noise of the roaster was just too much to ignore for me, Aside from the noise the place makes a great cup of coffee and is well worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I was hopeful...beans roasted on site - check.  Hipster baristas - check.  Drinkable espresso shots - ummm...barely...really meh espresso, and, seeing as they're Grinder's Coffee Company, it seems that this would be the most important thing.  Kind of seemed like they didn't tamp the grounds enough before pulling the shots, maybe?  

If I'm in the area again, I may give them another shot at shots, but...I wouldn't go out of my way to do so based on the first impression."}
{"text":"I really wasn't a huge fan of this coffee shop. I had to change my order a few times and I kind of felt like I was inconveniencing the person taking my order. And I got a cold brew which I guess they dilute (probably to save on cost), and honestly there's no need to dilute cold brew, that's the point of it, it should be strong and not diluted, but honestly it tasted like just ok iced coffee, and it didn't give me that same coffee buzz from regular cold brew. Their extremely serious iced vanilla latte my friend got was pretty good though.  I probably wouldn't need to come back here, but maybe if I'm in a real pinch."}
{"text":"Superb Coffee. Pathetic sandwiches and paninis. Hated the place after i ate the sandwich. i was told there were not veggies available at all. Then why sell a sandwich? They threw some chicken on the bread and gave it, after which i threw it in the trash."}
{"text":"Great Chai.. and they understood my pet peeve of not wanting ice in my drink. (Hate my drink getting water-y and tasteless in 5 mins!) Yum"}
{"text":"I had coffee there today with a good friend and just loved this neat little place. The barista was very sweet and our drinks were ready pretty quick. Not really anything exciting but a nice little quiet place to have coffee and conversation. There wasn't a whole lot of pastries but what we had was good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"excellent coffee, helpful & kind staff, smiles & local art all around! might even buy myself a bag of beans :)  couldn't decide on a coffee drink, and the sweet barista helped me find the perfect one. skip the boring Starbucks & Caribou, and try Grinders!"}
{"text":"It's the COFFEE knuckleheads!  Who cares if one staff person has a bad day, or if your overly sweet tiger milk drink is not right or the art is tacky... I go here for coffee.  The rest of you stay away from this place... I want my pick of their fresh roasted beans including the hard to find Peaberry.. that's right... these guys actually get green beans from around the world and roast them there on site... I know what day of the week they do it too... and I am not telling you.  Stay away!."}
{"text":"Recently discovered, good coffee, nice cashiers and baristas. The 3 times I've been, the owner has been there, and I have overheard her being short/rude to her customers. Today, it was my turn. I will take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great cup of coffee. Friendly Staff and the blueberry scone hot the spot.  When I'm back I'm back in Phoenix I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood coffee shop. It's really close to my future home! My husband and I had the chance to grab a cup of coffee and a muffin. We spoke to whom I might assume was an owner about the neighborhood. She was well informed and it seemed like she knew most people that walked through her door. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Grinders is a little cup of heaven nestled next to the mountains in Sunnyslope.  Run by Dennis Miller (NOT of SNL), he has been roasting and brewing his coffee ever since this shopping center opened almost 10 years ago.  He features the artwork of local artists each month as well as wi-fi while you are enjoying your beverage.  Be sure to come on the Second Saturday of each month to enjoy their ongoing series of Jazz & Blues.  You never know who's going to show up and perform!  But you can be assured you WILL have a foot stompin' good time!"}
{"text":"A big shoutout to Grinders Coffee for the amazing black ice tea. When looking for a great place to stop and enjoy some very flavorful tea, look no further. When my travels bring me back to Phoenix, I'll be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"GREAT latte. Best I have had in a while. Glad I discovered this place!"}
{"text":"Today was my third time coming here and I must say the coffee is pretty good. I won't lie I am pretty picky about my order but I always say it in a way the barista or cashier could understand it. Two of the three times I have been here there is one female employee that I have found to be rude. First off, she doesn't seem like she wants to be there, second she has given me attitude not once but twice. When I asked for more milk and flavor she sighed and made it sound like I was asking for too much. I have been a barista myself and always made sure to present great customer service."}
{"text":"Just got in from a great evening at Grinders! Who knew you could hear amazing blues music for free -- in Sunnyslope of all places -- on the 2nd Saturday of each month!? I did, actually. The real question is why don't I go every month!?

So, now I'm hopped up on a dirty chai latte and I must share the details about this neighborhood gem. Truly, the Valley's BEST neighborhood coffee shop! For a number of reasons...

1.) Grinders is a place where everyone feels welcome from high school kids to retirees taking advantage of the free wi-fi.

2.) They roast their OWN beans. That's right. They wheel a roaster out onto the same concrete slab that becomes the stage for Valley blues legends like Ronnie Whitehead on 2nd Saturdays and roast the beans for themselves!! I find their coffees to be pretty earthy and smooth. 

3.) The fudgy pecan brownies are rich and chocolaty. The scones are biscuit-like and just the right amount of barely sweet. (I haven't tried the danish, but they look deadly!)

4.) They are generous in sharing their own talents and promoting the talents of others, ensuring access to arts and culture. Each month, they allow a different local artist to show their work on the coffee shop walls. And while ordinarily they are not open past 6 p.m. on Saturday, an exception is made on the 2nd Saturday of each month when you can sit outside and listen to  live jazz and/or blues from 8 - 10 p.m.  And, by the way, Dennis, the owner, is a bad ass on the harmonica! 

We really are so lucky to have such a great business, doing great things, in the community!"}
{"text":"Very cool little coffee shop! Right next to my friends salon she works at (salon forma) so it makes it that much better ! Staff is awesome and the cinnamon buns are yummy ! I got a white chocolate mocha and it actually had a white chocolate taste unlike most chain coffee shops , double yay ! :)"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop for studying or just getting a quick cup of coffee or a smoothie. Owner is very sweet and takes care of her customers. Very clean with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I have to say it's a relief to not have to head south for some good espresso but this may be too far north...not sure. Their espresso is locally roasted and smooth so they automatically go into my top five. I also like the fact that the crowd is decidedly not the coffee snob crowd you'll find in venues further south. That being said, on my first visit the crowd was more the Sunnyslope crowd so I didn't know what to make of everything.

All that said, the coffee is good and I really liked the choices on their menu and they are all about local business. If I can come here and get a good Americano without having to wait in a long line I think I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Place is great. The batistas are always friendly and helpful. I ordered an ice vanilla latte, and unfortunately they ran out of vanilla but he still whipped up a great latte using vanilla and caramel mix. The prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping here for a latte and a baked treat.  The staff is really friendly and their service is great.  It's a nice place to kick back, enjoy your order, feel the breeze on the patio, and relax.  The hot, Hazelnut Latte and Chocolate Fudge Brownie are a great and refreshing combo.  Yum!  Give them a try, I'm sure you will return."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and pretty knowledgeable. Got a cold press iced coffee, which is how you separate the wheat from the chaff, for my coffee money.

Sat outside at shaded concrete topped tables. A very enjoyable experience.

If i lived in town, this would probably be my go-to java joint."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time because I wanted something besides the typical Starbucks. The coffee is great! I ordered a Carmel macchiato and it taste just as great as Starbucks. I was very impressed. I also ordered a bagel with cream cheese, which was not as great but oh well. I thought the bakery products were homemade cause there's very little to choose from, but it didn't taste that way. I definitely will be back for coffee, but probably not breakfast."}
{"text":"Coffee I can get the same at the canteen here at work.

The eyebrow raise at me when my drink was ready wasn't the \"customer service\" I expected from someone I didn't know. It would've been perfect if his pinkie was raised as he handed it to me.

Decor was interesting but not somewhere I would go back to unless I was desperate or forgot I had been here before."}
{"text":"I paid $5 for a cup of foam. I went in asking for a large/tall hot cup of coffee with half the caramel sugar and received an entire cup of foam for $5. Definitely not recommended. Atmosphere isn't too friendly. I rather go pay $8 at Starbucks than to come back here"}
{"text":"I've NEVER been happy to pay more than $4 for a 'grande'-sized latte... until I tried this place. It's on my way to the office, and I decided to give it a try. As already noted by other Yelpers, this place roasts its own beans, on site. I got a vanilla latte and wow... this is not Starbucks. This was a cuppa POW, right in the kisser. Loved it! You should check it out. =)"}
{"text":"I generally brew my own coffee at home, and if not, I usually end up at the St*rb*cks drive-thru, but when I have time to walk down the street for coffee, this is where I end up.  Excellent house roast, roasted on premises, good people behind the counter.  I enjoy the croissants, flaky and light (like me!), but haven't tried any of the other 'home-made' pastries they have available.

Better then your corporate coffee, made by real people."}
{"text":"I popped into Grinders yesterday afternoon (a bit after lunch time) for a pick-me-up.  I just love this neighborhood gem.  There's a nice comfy vibe and the staff is welcoming and accomodating.  They patiently fielded my questions about available sugar-free syrup options and happily indulged my request for a combination of syrups for my iced latte.  It was fantastic!

I've recently been informed that they host blues music on the 2nd Saturday evening of each month.  I can't wait to check it out next month."}
{"text":"For a place that roasts their own beans, I would expect a little better.

Also, for a place in the Sunnyslope area, I'd expect lower prices.

That being said, Grinders is a good place to go if you live in the area and really don't feel like driving down to Roosevelt for a cup of coffee. It's certainly better than McDonald's coffee, and at least better than Starbucks as well. 

But if you're really into the coffee scene, then no. I'd definitely not suggest Grinders as your first introduction to Phoenix coffee. If you really don't care very much and just want somewhere peaceful to go read a book, eat a pastry, drink some sweetened coffee, then have at it. Grinders is what you want."}
{"text":"I enjoy this gem of a coffee joint and discovered it shortly after moving into the neighborhood a few months ago with a friend. Something notable is the local art displayed and the vibrant setting the shop presents its customers. Excellent coffee and friendly service. Would definitely recommend to all who come across it!"}
{"text":"Brought a friend who's worked for Starbucks for years and she was impressed with the roasting equipment. She asked the barista to try the beans before and after roasting and the girl was very friendly and more than happy to oblige. We didn't realize it was time to close and the barista didn't rush us out or seem exasperated, which gets big kudos from me. Got a small mocha and a brownie, both were great. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better coffee shops in Phoenix, quiet  low key atmosphere and out of the way. The Mocha Madness frappe is phenomenal, probably the best mocha frappuccino I've had anywhere. Something like a plain latte is very good, if not quite to the quality of say Lux, but still on a different level to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This place knows coffee.... not that over roasted thin tasting stuff you get at that popular chain either.  They know the science of getting the best out of the bean.

The beans here are roasted on the premises, on Monday and Wednesday morning. In my opinion, the owner, is an artist in coffee roasting.  He keeps a delectable assortment of coffees at a very good price.... they also have pastries and light dining.

Plenty of parking.  Located on the southeast corner of Central and Dunlap.  The coffee is great, the seating is comfortable and the people are very nice.

They have added a website:

http://www.grinderscoffeeco.com/"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because the last three times I've been here it's taken me 20 mins to get a latte. Not to mention the barista hating life and complaining the entire time. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. Had some tea and sat outside with my boyfriend. Enjoyed the weather and played some cards. Very relaxing."}
{"text":"A solid independent coffee shop. They get 5 stars just for trying to serve good coffee in the Starbucks age. They roast their own beans, have two house blends and several single origins, and the typical coffee shop food menu of sandwiches and such. They may not serve what I consider to be \"connoisseur level\" coffee but the basic fundamentals are there (no V60 pour overs or milligram-perfect dosing rituals though, lol). The beans are roasted on site in small batches and are fresh. Don't get me wrong, the coffee is very good but if your standard is a Klatch or Intelligentsia then you may not leave completely impressed. It still falls well within my range of acceptability 
They've been here forever and are very active in supporting the local Sunnyslope arts scene and community. Not hipster - upscale, this isn't Cartel or Lux, just a nice local coffee joint where you will find a mix of old timers meeting for their daily coffee and high schoolers from across the street hanging out after school. 
They have a nice espresso blend and they do cold-pressed coffee as well. The Americano is my standard. And if you want a decaf you can order a Why Bother, lol."}
{"text":"I Love going here every morning to start my day!  Grinders has the Strongest, Best tasting coffee I've ever had.  The owners are extremely passionate about what they do, and will certainly take their time to explain to you their knowledge of coffee and the method of their coffee making process. Everyone that works their is extremely personable. Highly recommended by me."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It was kind of kooky, full of art and all sorts of odds and ends. The staff was great. Very friendly. They roast their own beans and have selections from different parts of the earth. My latte was just what I needed. Love quirky little places like this. They make me feel like I belong somewhere :)"}
{"text":"This is a very cool and offbeat coffee house. There is a large roaster inside and several different kinds of green coffee beans - I can only imagine how amazing it would be to be there when they are roasting. For the very fact that they roast in-house, you should definitely check them out.

I tried their iced coffee, which they told me was cold brewed, but it just wasn't great. Hoping that maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"The best coffee is freshly roasted and ground. This is the place to get it, have a cup there or to go. Try taking a pound of coffee home and you'll never go back to grocery store coffee roasted a year ago in another country."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing coffee! I love that they roast their own beans. I got an iced mocha and it was super smooth. Staff was decent I guess... not super friendly which was disappointing because the atmosphere seemed great. Loved the experience, would have given 5 stars for friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Coffee is ok. The sandwich is mediocre like you can make it at home for $7? I don't think so. I expected more. Their employees don't have uniforms but they are way too sloppy eve looks dirty. On a tank top all sloppy it doesn't look professional. I know it's a coffee shop but it says a lot. I like how they have the different coffee beans decor on the wall. That's pretty cool. Prolly won't come back"}
{"text":"it is a different coffee shop from the recent trendy places popping up around town.  they do roast their own coffee but not my favorite flavor.  the seating area was quite unkept, i felt like i had stepped into my grandmas kitchen with all the bobbles everywhere.  i liked that they had local artists on the walls but the way they were being shown looked disorganized and messy.  this place is not in my neighborhood  and probably will not venture here again"}
{"text":"The coffee is great and the refills ate free!!! And they have free wifi.....how does it get better than this? ?

Plenty of parking and friendly staff.

A good place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I think I'm in love. Truth is, I'm promiscuous with coffeehouses and tend to love the one I'm with. But Grinder's is an adorably soothing place for a Sunday morning coffee, being completely without hip conceptual DJs, big screen TVs, or deal-making hipsters. Sip your brew, watch the progress of the sun over the mountain, read an actual print newspaper.

The sweet roll is properly flaky, not squishy, and has either cream cheese or sour cream frosting. This is the best flaky pastry I've had in Phoenix.

Of course, you're now in Sunnyslope, with nothing to do but a small shopping center. Walk to the transit center and find a bus up to the antique shops on Cave Creek."}
{"text":"There are so many great things about Grinders!  Rotating Art from local artists (and not the ones trying their hardest to win the next hipster award), live music with great jazz bands, excellent coffee and tea reasonably priced. The fourth star is awarded for the pecan/cream cheese Danish thing the server recommended. It was so good I couldn't decide weather to scarf it down or savor each bite."}
{"text":"About time I wrote a review for this awesome coffeehouse. The irony is I am not much of a coffee drinker, I prefer tea. The baristas here know how to make good tea and from the amount of people that frequent this place for coffee, I am assuming they make good coffee too. They grind their own coffee and when that happens, it can get a little loud but it's for a short time.

So what do I love about this place? 
1) The staff is friendly, they make an effort to know your name and remember your orders. The second day I walked in, Drew, one of the baristas greeted me with a smile and remembered my order. It feels good to start your morning with happy faces. 
2) The tea is really good because they know how to brew it so it doesn't taste bitter. I also got their hot chocolate once and I happened to stop into Starbucks that evening for a hot chocolate and it tasted disgusting to me. I guess my taste buds were spoiled from the morning hot chocolate . 
3) They open early morning (6am) and  have plenty outlets and tables for studying. It's usually quiet except in the mornings around 7:30-8:30 and afternoons around 3:00-4:00 when the high school kids are out. 
4) Outdoor seating is available and the inside is well lit and gets plenty sunlight. (I don't like to study in dark places, not so great for the eyes)
5) Very affordable
6) FREE refills on the tea! 
7) Free wi-fi 


The lunch sandwiches are $7.50 and they're okay- nothing to rave about. However, the blueberry Danish is delicious, better than strawberry!"}
{"text":"This week the hubby and I have been trying to experience a different coffee shop every morning based on Yelp reviews and the area that we'll be in. This was my pick. 

I ordered a double con panna (my head was still spinning hours after). The baristas were awesome but what I found fascinating was at one point in our visit a man went behind the counter, helped himself to a pumpkin scone and told the barista that he was giving it to a homeless man. He also asked for an espresso drink saying that he'd make it himself but he was busy, carrying a baby. I'm assuming that he was the owner? If not, maybe I can go behind the counter too? Nah.

This is definitely a cool little coffee shop. They have a latte of the week; this week was the Valencia Mocha (no clue what that is though). They also roast their own beans.

They have a loyalty card, and dogs are welcome. Several regulars came in as the barista greeted them by name or asked if they wanted their usual.

There is a big area for outside seating and ample indoor, plus free wi-fi (ask for the password).

The mix of clientele made it a very comfortable place and the coffee was excellent."}
{"text":"I used to be a great fan 5*+ of this quaint, interesting and unusual place with the outstanding smells of coffee to die for.

Elizabeth, 
I value your opinion on the matter of pets at restaurants. Now we have a very delicate balance to uphold...legally service animals have to be with the owner inside or out...just pets though are strictly outside. But please don't write us off. We are also hosting music Saturday from 10-12pm if you're interested.

Shelina, I have attended some of the \"gigs\" outside and really enjoyed them.  I am cynophobic.  I do not believe that pet owners should put me in jeopardy anywhere not just from being mauled but also with all the germs, viruses, and new diseases being out of control I as a human should have as much rights as a dog.  I do not hate dogs or any animal for that matter I do fear them and the so called SERVICE animal routine is  a total crock.  REAL service animals have been trained and are leashed and listen to the masters.  The bogus SERVICE animals that are rowdy, out of control, are not on 6 FOOT LEASHES but the extended ones jeopardize me to being either mauled or infected.  Technically, this Buddy dog and bogus \"SERVICE\" dogs are the establishments responsibility as much as the neglect owners. I can not express to you the many times I have been in a check out line and out of nowhere a dog comes up from behind me and scares the sH*t out of me.  I went into a Century link store last week by Hobby Lobby in the mall and the dog did not even have a leash at all.  The owner told me  the dog is not going to hurt me and I freaked as it was on my leg.  What does it take for pet owners to understand that it is there pet not mine and I want no part of them.  I am not a hater of them I am AFRAID of them and as a human I feel I should  have the right to go out and RELAX with out someone's bogus \"SERVICE DOG'  unnerving me  I honestly hope that both the pet owner and the establishment gets ticketed.  The deficit would be paid in full.  Any animal around ANY PLACE THAT HAS FOOD in my opinion should be closed down by authorities.  So many mauling, so many uncomfortable situations and so many inconsiderate pet owners.  The only reason this is happening is because establishment makes no attempt to distinguish what is legally a SERVICE dog or some idiot pet owner that feels laws do  not apply to them..  If you take your dog to PET places I will not go there as that place is for them and the pet owners.  AS FOR CAFE's or grocery stores or public places where your dog is on my body or near my body or I am with in mauling distance, in my opinion you need to be ticketed or NOT ALLOWED INSIDE."}
{"text":"I am in love with there ice coffee. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. I always go out of my way to go buy my coffee here. And I been coming here since I can remember and they still haven't fail me. The prices are awesome and I have people always asking me where I get my coffee from. I definitely like to talk about this awesome place."}
{"text":"How lucky to have this place close to my house, I come here often and buy fresh roasted beans as gifts and also make the coffee at home for myself. I am telling you that this is some seriously good coffee! I recommend these guys to other coffee drinkers I know and will continue to do so. Great stuff! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This is not a four star coffee joint. First impression  was of an extremely dirty run down shop. I had second thoughts about ordering but against my better judgement I requested an iced coffee. They had none so they had to make it fresh. The coffee taste was lacking in all senses to the taste buds. My iced coffee had an old plastic tubing taste with a small small hint of coffee flavor....mostly water (yuk). I don't write reviews...just had to this time because I felt I was mislead from the 4 star rating given to this place. Extremely dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop. They have their own roaster, which is a big plus.

They have a nice large table, for setting up a laptop or whatnot.

They have ample outdoor seating, which is always a big bonus!

They tend to close on the early side; 7-8 PM, which, for a coffee shop is kinda weird.

They have delicious blended and iced drinks, as well as their hot drinks. They have a selection of bulk beans, but I have not tried any of them as of yet.

The Sunnyslope Art Walk happens in this shopping center, so that could be your opportunity to stop in and check them out."}
{"text":"Great shop! The cold brew coffee is smooth and delicious also the owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. 
I like the fact they roast raw beans in house. 
I wish I lived closer!

One more thing, I love that they have a (serious)  32oz size. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Refugees from the 60's. The owner from Grinders own band puts on a hell of a show. Rock 'n roll and blues cover, the guys are damn good. Eric Claption, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn just to name a few. The Sunnyslope Art Walk this evening was super fun sitting on their sofa.

I enjoyed the white chocolate cafe mocha and for the first time Grinders was offering sandwiches at $6.50. I ordered the club and it was excellent. The gals are always very pleasant. The couple of artist doing work in the store were very talented. I liked the Marilyn and Red Sun on canvas."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. Decaf fans look no further - really good. Also excellent pastries made on site - buttery, flaky croissants, fluffy scones, all yummy. Doggie friendly too, with water bowls for furry friends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop to relax and drink real coffee.  You could sit down and read a book and drink your favorite brew."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee I've ever had -- and I lived in Portland. Insanely good selection & product. Tanzanian peaberry off the charts. Owner gets beans from multiple sources to ensure that his selection is the best."}
{"text":"I was there today and the service was awesome.  The coffee was terrific. It was a great place to hang out and get some work done!"}
{"text":"Someone described this coffee shop as groovy. It is an apt adjective to use to describe this coffee shop.

Service was fast and both baristas were very efficient. In the space they work in they are able to make all the coffee drinks as well as toasted sandwiches.

The wall art is interesting and quite varied. For the Halloween season, there are couple of paintings of skeletons working hard. I am sure there is a political message hidden in them somewhere. 

I had a triple espresso con panna ($3.50) in a ceramic cup.  It packed a very smooth punch and was good to the last drop. If you enjoy a straight espresso, a con panna adds a little sweetness and doesn't overshadow the flavor. 

Their drink sizes are interesting--short, tall, serious or extremely serious. 

If you want a sandwich, grab a menu and mark what you want on it. Easy as pie!

This is definitely a great local alternative to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Fun place to hangout and have your favorite cup and a scone. I need to make this a little longer or it will be posted as a tip."}
{"text":"I was looking for a secluded coffee shop that wasn't teeming with hipsters and of course, offered quality coffee. Grinders was perfect. It has a large, diverse menu with different coffee flavors and specialties. I happily ordered the Viennese Mocha, which was delicious! 
The clientele looked older and local; it seemed like a genuine place to catch up and chat with friends, vs. a place to bring your laptop and work on your computer. I was the latter. I had trouble with the Wi-Fi, the service was pretty slow, but I definitely enjoyed the coffee!"}
{"text":"Great local, independent coffee shop. Coffee is great and most important, their customer service. Grinders has wifi, and it's cozy atmosphere makes it a great place to work/study. Not only do they roast their own coffee beans, but they sell them as well!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a little coffee place, besides your usual Starbucks.  I came across Grinders Coffee thanks to Yelp, we decided to give it a shot.  No doubt it was a great choice, far better than Starbucks!  My iced coffee didn't have a bitter taste to it as it often does at other coffee places.  It had bold rich flavor that wasn't overwhelming.   

We had no issues with service once so ever, the gentlemen was friendly and offered drink recommendations based upon our preferences."}
{"text":"The coffee and my sandwich were alright--it was the experience that really left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

I stopped in on a Sunday afteroon, wanting a bite to eat and an iced coffee. There was no sign of food on the main menu, and when I asked if they had any, the guy at the register pointed to a stack of papers. I looked and saw they were a circle-what-you-want type thing, so I did that. Then he proceeded to tell me they were out of turkey as well as pepperjack. Ok, sub ham for turkey and jack for pepperjack. Then he tells me they're out of iced coffee....now sure how, but fine...I picked something else. As my credit card was running he made an exasperated noise and told me they were out of pretzel buns too. Honestly, I was at my wits end at this point, but since my card already run and I was starving, I just rolled with it and told him to put it on sourdough. The other guy behind the counter was apologetic, saying they get their shipments on Mondays and that was why they were out of so many things. 

I had asked the guy who rang me up for the wifi password and I sat down and attempted to connect to the wifi. There was no network with their name, so I chose the strongest signal, but it wasn't theirs. When the guy who took my order brought out my sandwich I asked which network it was. He told me (and it was not anything obvious) with a tone like I was a total moron and I was putting him out for asking. Then, at 1:30 he walked up to me and said \"I just wanted to tell you that we close at 2:00 sharp.\" I could already tell because they were bringing in the outside furniture, plus I had checked with the nicer of the two employees not two minutes before that, but thank you for the rude reminder.

It's really a shame that I had such an awful experience, because I'm signing a lease at a place really close to here. I'd love to have a local coffee shop I feel comfortable stopping by or working in, but this one certainly isn't it."}
{"text":"Their coffee is so good its fresh and fast this is probably the best coffeeyou can watch them make it right in front of you,they are supper nice ,supper clean."}
{"text":"Over this place. This used to be our favorite coffee spot. Seems to have gone down hill a bit. Not the same friendly employees and quality is lacking. Also, shouldn't take 20 minutes to make an americano, especially when I'm the only customer waiting for a drink."}
{"text":"Very Cool coffee shop! Features local art, and is a very cozy place to go. Coffee  is completely delicious! Good bagels too!"}
{"text":"I was going for a long bike ride from Glendale, but did not quite make it to Lux before freaking out about how little homework I had accomplished. I spied Grinders on my phone, and went in this direction. Around 3p the place was swarming with teens, it seems like they graciously give the kids free water. Although many hard surfaces mean it can be a little loud with just a few people, I like the vibe. It also feels good to support  a place that gives much back to the community----from fresh roasted coffee beans to display space for local artists to music. Grinders is not about the hardware---but the software."}
{"text":"The new owners have really turned this place around!  It's like night and day.  The store is cleaner than I've ever seen it and much less cluttered.  The customer service has improved tenfold as well!  

Congrats Shelina and family"}
{"text":"I grew up in Sunnyslope.  Where this little mall is where the Dog N'Suds resided.  I am always amazed to see the development along Dunlap; the area which gave my parents (from New Hampshire) a small town feel in the depth of Phoenix.  That was the late 70's and early 70's.  Now there is no longer a Brookshires to get your coffee but this little java shack.  Tucked into a little strip mall it has a cute little patio which I am sure is nice when the weather us the same.  Inside there is a bank of hook ups for electronic devices, local artwork and a menu similar to other espresso bars.  The cookie I had was homemade and delish.  The hot mocha skinny was very good with their own roasted beans freshly ground.  Nice sweetness on the mocha and no whipped because I ordered it skinny.  I like this spot."}
{"text":"Horrible hours. Like everyone else most coffee shops are 5am- 9pm which accommodates busy people like myself so I rarely can make it here within their short hour days but the Coffee is tasty! Food is yummy and the live music they had Thursday evening was a treat! They have a roaster there which is great for buying beans by the pound fresh! Seating could improve and be more cozy, its a small typical coffee shop.  I would like to see the artwork with a theme and one featured artist at a time because the pieces were small and by different artists which was distracting. Stop in and try it out!"}
