{"text":"I believe this is a Chinese run Korean restaurant. Don't let the restaurant name throw you off - there are lots of non bbq dishes on their menu. In fact I don't even think bbq is their focus judging from the menu, so the restaurant name is confusing. Very mediocre food. There are many other Korean restaurants that have better tasting, bigger portioned dishes for the same price."}
{"text":"To be clear I didn't try the bbq and only ordered soups.   It was dead on a Tues night. The service is friendly, it is a new restaurant so it is clean along with the washrooms.  Most of the bbq offerings I noticed are only for 2 orders or more for a portable grill top. I didn't see the tables as actual stationary grill tables.  I ordered the tofu stew. It was very good. Very bland and flavourless. I was not impressed at all. My dad ordered the pork bone soup and that was marginally better. Lots of meat on those bones! The side dishes weren't very good or memorable."}
{"text":"First place I've seen the lettuce combo, it's a fresh add to the traditional Korean dishes. Basically two dishes for under $20, pretty good value!"}
{"text":"Having been to Doh Won a couple of times, I've always enjoyed their food as kind of a \"fast-food\" korean place. However, keep in mind that it can be a bit pricey for low budgets since nothing is under $10 other than the pork-bone soup ($8.99) and no appetizers offered, other than the free side dishes. Regardless, if you're looking for a hearty meal with big portions, Doh Won is the place for you!  My only big critique about the restaurant is that the service can be inconsistent. When Doh Won first opened, the main server was a woman who was extremely nice, generous with her side dish portions albeit a little slow. However, keep in mind that this was when the restaurant just opened so we understood completely. Unfortunately, over the past few visits, I have yet to see her and there are other servers covering the restaurant. They are much quicker (yay!) but one of the downsides is they suddenly started enforcing a 1-refill rule for the side dishes. Although their side dishes have grown in variety, I was disappointed in the fact that you can only get one refill since the portions are extremely small and at other restaurants, refilling is almost unlimited. Although this will not deter me from coming, it was a downside I wanted to mention bc I love side dishes in general :))"}
{"text":"New Korean Place had to give it a try dropped by for dinner and found out they had my favorite ja jern myun so had to get that portions and taste was good I like their  banchan dishes too"}
{"text":"So first off, this newly opened korean restaurant took over one of my favourite places for pho. It was truly heartbreaking to see yet another one of my favourite restaurants leave me, but regardless I still mustered up the courage to go here.   When I first entered into the restaurant, it right off the bat reminded me of Vic Hong. Why? Well...the restaurant essentially still looks ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME. The old tables, booths, wallpaper are still being used. It didn't really do any sort of renovation except maybe add some floral decorations here and there. As a result, I felt a little sad since all I could see is Vic Hong. LOOL  Anyways, I got the Samgyetang. It was $12.99 for the half chicken version and it wasn't bad. The soup was super tasty and I kinda liked not having to add the salt on my own (a lot of other restaurants do that). The chicken was a little more dry than I would like and not gonna lie, when the waitress first brought it over...it didn't look the least bit appetizing. It looked really oily and just gross. So presentation wise, they could've done a better job. Ban chan was kinda lame so yep.    Service was decent to say the very least. There was only one person working so it was actually a mission to get her to remember to bring my damn take out box LOOL. I legit had to ask her three times like okay. Also, she gave me extra change and I told her that and she still didn't get that she gave me extra. MORE ATTENTIVE PLS MY GIRL U BE LOSING MONEY IF U DONT NOTICE EVEN AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS TOLD YOU.   Regardless, would I come back?  Eh... it's a maybe for now. Although the soup was good, it just pains me to see remnants of Vic Hong still there."}
{"text":"I will give this place 2.5 stars. Doh Won replaced the Vietnamese restaurant in the plaza. They keep some of their staff, that's why the service is not as warm or friendly as other korean restaurants.  Food was decent and tasted authentic. They offer veggie wrap and black goat soup which are not offered in many restaurants.  However, the portion is on the small side and price on the high end compares to other korean restaurants in the neighborhood. For example, $19.99 for a bulgogi beef veggie wrap plate; the beef was very little and they only gave 6 lettuce leaves and not refillable?   I am a korean food lover and they are really not on par, so I won't go back even though it is in my hood."}
{"text":"Food: Pretty good! Every item we ordered tasted great and did not fail to impress.  Rating. 4 stars   Service:  The waiters are not rude, just really forgetful and careless. From the 3 times I've been here, the food we ordered took 50 minutes, 30 minutes, and 20 minutes. On one occasion, the server  never refilled our tea even after we asked her twice. A different server also completely forgot to take down our orders TWICE when we wanted to order another dish after we got our meal. We ended up telling her to forget about.     Overall, id recommend the Owl of Minerva right across the street for comparable Korean food with much better service."}
{"text":"3.75/5  Alas, another restaurant has appeared among the kingdom of food shops in the Bayview Plaza. And after a monopoly by Owl of Minerva for far too long, it's refreshing to see another Korean restaurant in the plaza! Here are a few pointers of the restaurant:  - First off, the portion sizes were pretty big - bigger than average. For those with small appetites like me, splitting one dish among two is enough to make you full.  - The service is pretty slow. This is probably because the restaurant is relatively new and still sorting out the kinks of its operations. Nonetheless, the staff were still really really nice  - My sister ordered the pork bone soup with additional ramen noodles. The meat portions were SUPER big, the broth was flavourful, and it didn't make her feel thirsty upon completing the meal - which is awesome since I feel most pork bone soups go way too intense with sodium content. PROTIP THO. Do not add additional ramen noodles all at once - or ask for it on the side because it takes a pretty long time to go through all the pork meat and by the time you finish, the leftover ramen noodles will get soggy and gross.  - The other members of my party ordered the bibimbap and were not very satisfied.   Again, I feel like the restaurant is still relatively inexperienced and still sorting out a few kinks here and there, but I can definitely see the potential :)"}
