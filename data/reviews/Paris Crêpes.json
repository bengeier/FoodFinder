{"text":"The place looks cute and the location is good. But for the food, I don't think I will go again."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible crepes. It's like they've never had good crepes. I got a banana nutella crepe and it came out rubbery, cold, and not enough nutella. Not only did I wait 15 minutes to order even though they saw me and I was the only customer but the it was super expensive. Stay away. It's a total tourist trap."}
{"text":"It's over priced for what you get, I agree with the other reviews for sure. I did like the second floor area to sit though"}
{"text":"Came here on 4/18/2015. The ground floor was very small as there were only a few tables and there is of course the counter and the place where they make the crepes. The staff is very friendly and there are a lot of crepes to choose from.   You order your crepe, choose buckwheat or regular crepe, pay, and find a seat taking your number with you. The staff will deliver the crepe to you calling out the number if they don't see it on your table.   This place is busy and they only have 2 crepe making stations. So the wait was a bit long for a crepe. There is more seating on the second floor however there is an indoor balcony type center where the second floor can see the first floor so that leaves less room for seating.   The views are good, with plenty of windows to see the outside. My date and I got the spinach, egg, and cheese crepe. The egg was mixed in the crepe batter and not in the filling of the crepe as we expected, and it was folded into a square, not the usual cake/pie slice shape. Very good tasting crepe!"}
{"text":"Friendly but clueless staff. They did not communicate properly with each other and had to redo one of our orders. The crepe itself is a very unpleasing chewy texture which you cannot cut with a knife and fork. The nutella filling crepes are better because the nutella softens them slightly. The cinnamon and sugar one is like cardboard with no actual flavor of cinnamon. Would have liked to have some powdered sugar on top for presentation as well. There are plenty of better crepe places in Montreal, go find one."}
{"text":"Pretty nice little place, nice view from upstairs. The populaire croissant with cheese and game and spinach is ok. Baileys crepe is really good!!"}
{"text":"The crepes were too chewy and hard to cut with a knife, the smoothies tasted like artificially sweetened tang and overall the price was way too much for what we ordered. The only reason why this place gets 2 stars was because of the nice staff."}
{"text":"We visited this place on 7/1/15. It is located only a block from our hotel, so we decided to try it.   The customer service was good and their crepes were OK. Small portions, but these crapes cost avarage of $8! Since I know Harajuku, Tokyo crapes, I think they are over priced."}
{"text":"Terrible! I went there to eat a nutella crepe and they gave me a very thin (what they call a crepe) with the smallest amount of nutella I've ever seen. When I put it to my mounth I didn't even feel I had something in it. So I asked them politely to add some nutella because they apparently didn't put any and they told me to pay 1 extra dollar. It's really a shame! With all the bottles of nutella that they have there they could at least add me some more. By the way the crepe was 9 dollars, but as we were 2 we had to pay $18 for absolutely nothing. At least now I know that next time I want to eat a nutella crepe I will go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"One of the worse crepes we ever had... it was our first visit in Montreal and what a big disapointement. Let me start by saying that it didn't taste good at all the crepes themselves were very chewy and almost tasteless if it wasn't for the toppings it would've been simply uneatable. The second worse thing was the pricing,  we had 3 crepes and 2 chocolate milks ....over $35 ...I mean come on the chocolate milk was for $5 ...its. insane... I don't recommend this place for anyone not if it was the only open spot. I usually don't write review but the disapointement did hit me hard this time."}
{"text":"Not bad, a little bit on the expensive side, though. Had the strawberry nutella crepe. I am new to the crepe scene, so far I am liking it.  Will come back to try breakfast or lunch crepe & will report back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in the mood for crepes so I yelped and we decide to try Paris Creps...we got the nutella-banana and nutella-strawberry crepes...WOW...with a cup of coffee and a milk we had a fantastic treat.  Absolutely check it out!"}
{"text":"Good service, new asian owner but still as good.  I love the decor. Has this vintage vibe... cute."}
{"text":"Crêpe décevante ! J'ai pris une crêpe au nutella avec a peine de quoi couvrir la crêpe, sans gout et la pâte était tres moyenne. En plus du prix que je trouve excessif."}
{"text":"We ordered a strawberry Nutella crepe and a cinnamon sugar with butter crepe. Both the crepes were very dry and tasted like a dry tortilla. The filling of the strawberry Nutella crepe was good, however the cinnamon sugar butter crepe barely had any filling... It was like eating a plain tortilla. I can get better crepes at the mall in Toronto than here. Definitely NOT worth the money... Approximately $8-10."}
{"text":"A quaint place in downtown Montreal that serves delicious crepes with a variety of options. The service can be slow since the place is usually crowded. They have seating upstairs. Good quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Had a strawberry Nutella crêpe.  Service was fast and crêpe was good. Pretty standard stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Polite staff. Great selection of crepes. Certainly a place to sit back and relax."}
{"text":"Best crepes I've ever had! So quaint and petite here. It's a place everyone should go to! Order your crepe then go upstairs and sit by the window and just watch outside. Pssst- the Irish coffee is to die for !"}
{"text":"Food - Crepes look delicious - We didn't eat here, but I watched them make the crepes and trust me, they look good and I'm sure they taste great - A lot time taken for presentation of crepe   Drinks - Slushee tastes great - Iced coffee, this is literally coffee poured over ice lol  Service - No issues, they were great"}
{"text":"We ambled over to this cute little joint to pick up dessert after having dinner at Sushi Nagoya (see review).  Staff was friendly and courteous and our order was ready within minutes, perfectly packaged.  I am a big fan of the nutella/banana combo and Cafe Paris does it just right: not skimpy on the nutella, but not so much that it kills the bananas.  The crepes here are also excellent: good texture, slightly sweet, and hot off the griddle.  All in all - an excellent place to stop for a sweet bite."}
{"text":"So I went to montreal on a family trip and was stuffed the whole time I was there and not able to try the crepe stand that stays open until 2 AM WOW!!!.... Looked yummylicious. I got all different kinds the nutella with strawberries with raspberries with spinach and egg and cheese yum yum and the apple tort caramel. All of them were okay nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered it and the cook who was making it ran downstairs I was going to head to the airport so I said let me pack my bags up in the car a block away and come back in ten minutes. I didn't come back till 20 mins later they only finished two crepes. It TAKES 30 seconds per side to cook and maybe a minute top for the toppings. WTF!!!!! All these new people had crepes and I was late to a flight sitting waiting for another twenty minutes. I had to go on a later flight. SLOW SLOW SLOW and not worth the troubles. When I came back the lady said we switched cooks and shifts... PLEEEEAAASE do not play me for stupid I know that asian was the same asian as earlier 3 minutes top per crepe... excuses excuses"}
{"text":"Maybe I am just not a crepe person...they always seem overpriced for what you get and I am never really blown away by the taste.  Maybe I just haven't gone to the right place.  My rating though isn't based on the crepe as it was on par with other crepes I have had.  Place needed a good dusting plus I saw the chef handling his phone while cooking a crepe. The crepe batter was also contained in large plastic containers with batter running down the sides.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Good coffee but the crepes were underwhelming. They were very overcooked and so tough that they were difficult to eat."}
{"text":"Had a savory crepe and wished I had gone for a sweet dessert crepe option. The crepe was underwhelming and dry, barely recognized it as a crepe.  However I also tried the dark chocolate mousse cake which was delicious."}
{"text":"I wandered in here with a friend, looking for a bite for lunch. I got a sweet nutella crepe while he got the cheese-apple. Portions were good for the price (crepes can run from $6-15) and drinks were reasonable. The staff was happy to speak to us in English, so that was a plus.  Not a lot of seating and it's a pretty small store, definitely nothing super fancy; we went at around 2pm and the place only had one other group there. Overall, we were happy with the experience!"}
{"text":"Breakfast crepe awful, cheese wouldn't even melt because it was so cold.  Left after one bite/mouthful.  $13+ wasted unfortunately."}
{"text":"Heard about it from some friend. Well, it was ok but not as good as I expected. But nice view from the window on the 2nd floor."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place.  They service was really fast and friendly.  The layout is very cramped, so if you are looking to sit with a group of...lets say 3, you may be out of luck.    The crepes themselves were good.  They had a good mix of savory as well as sweet.  They also made some unusual pairing, like Nutella and cheese.  This is actually very good.  All in al it was not a bad outing.  They keep good evening hours, so you can enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying, do not be fooled by their name. By no means, is this something you'd find in Paris or anywhere in France.  From the crepes, to the ambiance, and the staff. The place was just \"Ok\"  Would I go back? No. This is why!  This little place with two floors is situated in the heart of downtown. Indeed it's convenient and easy to find. Also easy to forget since their crepes are far from memorable. As for the staff, nothing to brag about or satisfied with.  On a Friday night at 8:00pm, my friend and I were the only ones about to sit down. To be the only customers on a Friday night, I'd say that is quite a bad sign!  The staff lack courtesy, enthusiasm, and willing to help you. Don't ask them to smile, they simply won't.   Now to the main focus. Their crepes. Prices range from $8.95-$12.95 per single crepe. Pricey? I'd say so!  My friend ordered the cheesecake crepe. With a overly fluffy mixture of some type of fluffy whipped topping and cream cheese \"taste\" with a few strawberry slices. Not fresh!  As for mine. I  ordered the dark chocolate and raspberry crepe. The dark chocolate was nicely melted, smooth and generous. As for the raspberries. They were far from being fresh, instead they were frozen and mashed into the crepe as part of the filling. Only 1/3 of the crepe had raspberries.  The texture of the crepes were rubbery, chewy, and not properly cooked. A slight taste of uncooked.  Yes, the portions are huge, but as a person who seeks quality over quantity. The size didn't impress me. Much less with such poor quality ingredients used as their fillings.  Do not be fool by the lovely scent of vanilla when walking by their store. The smell is stronger than the taste. Unfortunately!  With many wonderful dessert locations throughout the city, I would strongly suggest you to simply keep walking.  This is certainly a place I would say, been there. Done that. I do not need to go back."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food but the service is horrendous. Staff is unhelpful, slow, lacking in proper communication skills."}
{"text":"A little crape place in the heart of Montreal. Atmosphere and decor is not the greatest. Heck even their cutlery are horrible; Styrofoam cups and plates. Crowed seating and not the cleanest place. However it has a decent view of the street and the food is good. You definitely get more bang for your buck, but I have tasted better crepe. A good place to get out of the cold and sit for a cheap quick snack."}
{"text":"fantastic tourist spot for lovers of the late night sort.  hungry at midnight? paris crepes.  got the munchies? paris crepes. got a hottie to stare at? paris crepes.   two story and at the corner of the fashionable downtown, it's easy to see that this place is a hit with many people. everything from pastry items down to drinks and eats.  however, the crepes are what most come here for.  they serve 'em savory and sweet, thin, and without a huge eggy flavor.  generous portions with good fresh toppings.   my fav spot? the top floor on the corner. best view ... beautiful for people watching while munching on goodies. :)"}
{"text":"Ideally situated for tourists, those strolling around downtown, and of course, all the late night food seeking people out there, Paris Crepe seems to be a great little place to go into.  This place is really a hit and miss. Initially, the name threw me off...I really did think the  kitchen was Parisian. But I was extremely mistaken. These are just normal, nothing special crepes that are either good or terrible.  Any of the ones with chocolate are usually ok...But don't get anything with cheese in it! I made that mistake a couple years ago and ordered a cheese and apple crepe expecting an amazing molten cheese with crunchy apples.......What I got was a crepe filled with soggy and very watery apples, topped with burger sliced processed cheese. Last time I ordered a crepe from there!  Portions are quite large, and they also have some great soft served ice cream. Overall, a 3/5 for inconsistency!"}
{"text":"I usually get Nutella and banana crepe, it is delicious but it is pricy. The service is always pleasent. I like to sit on the 2nd floor because the scenery is looking our on St Catherine."}
{"text":"It's hard walking passed this place without smelling the crepes they're making! It's almost impossible to walk by and not want to eat there!   I ordered the nutella and banana crepe! Paid about 10$ and it was worth every bit of it! People usually have a hard time finishing their plate and I can't blame them!  I really enjoyed it  and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here when I was visiting Montreal since it was close to my hotel. The ambiance was acceptable but the ventilation in the cafe was poor. The latte I had was delicious and frothy. The crepes however could have been better. I got a egg and cheese crepe and my friend got a Nutella crepe. The batter was bland and the crepes slightly chewy. The egg and cheese was dry. The Nutella crepe was slightly better but then again maybe the Nutella was hiding the bland flavoring of the batter."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. Left after watching the two people in line in front of me do the same, also without being acknowledged."}
{"text":"mehhhhhhhh. Pretty plain, served lukewarm.  Upstairs level was covered in garbage, so almost no tables usable, because the server downstairs was busy eating a sandwich (not even putting it down while taking orders or anything).  Brought us our crepe --- with no fork or napkins or anything.  So unhelpful."}
{"text":"The crepes weren't anything special. But nobody is going to make a visit here based on some yelp reviews. It's not that type of place. It's the type of place where you grab a crepe, pay, and then eat it on the run.  The only good thing here is there's an upstairs seating section, so you can get get some quiet time while eating. So I take back what I said, you don't necessarily have to eat your crepe on the run. You can eat it upstairs."}
{"text":"(3.5 if being more precise) This place is great if you like big portions, but not as tasty as other spots I've ventured for crepes.  Location is great and the family stopped in here before the trek up to the top of Mont-Royal.  Ideally located it's a great place to start the day.  And literally I was not even thinking about food after stopping here until dinner.  Disappointed their horseradish sauce had no kick. Coffee was average and drink selection past that was canned stuff.  Small but nice upstairs overlooking St. Catherine's which was a big plus.  Prices are kinda low for the the location, but food quality matches the price.  All in all not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Nothing inventive. The crepes were decent but overall kind of plain. We got butter and brown sugar. The top layer had all of the flavor and the rest was just plain crepe.   The walnut and honey crepe was literally like 4 scoops of whole walnuts drenched in honey. Guess there wasn't anything too exciting in the description that I should've expected haha $8 though...   There were however some other interesting items like a bailey's creme and raspberry one I wish I tried. Perhaps those would be better. Maybe will try again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely Not the best place for completely overpriced crepes but it served me well when i needed one after a particularly heavy nite of drinking. It was pretty much the only restaurant opened that wasn't creepy or gross on Crescent  I like the savory (beef, mushroom, cheese) crepe better than the other 2 we had (strawberry ricotta and banana nutella)  The crepe itself is very mediocre. I'm not sure they know how to make a crepe...it was just a thin doughy thing that held the rest of the stuffing inside."}
{"text":"So good! Ham and cheese was delicious.  They serve mostly dessert crepes.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What does $20 by you these days: a cold sandwich (it was grilled, yet still cold), a decent crepe and a bottle of soft drink."}
{"text":"Overpriced with little filling.  We order two crepes. One with Nutella and one with caramel. It's as if they only had one spoon of caramel left and didn't want to use it. The Nutella was spread so thin you could hardly taste it.   We paid $30 for two crepes and two bottles of water.   You can find better crepes for less money."}
{"text":"Very subpar in every aspect.  I'd like to give it one-star but I'm strangely in a generous mood today.  Had the ham and cheese crepe.  The crepe is overly sweet; very stingy on the fillings; a paper-thin sheet of ham and some sort of runny, bland tasteless cheese.  The coffee tasted as if it had been sitting in the thermos since early morning-which it probably was.  Overall not good and expensive-$16.  Granted it is Montreal and it is on a prime location.  Still $16 is in no way justified for the lousy crepe."}
{"text":"I was half in the bag on an early Saturday afternoon so perhaps this rating speaks to that but I wanted something sweet and figured I'd go back here and give it another throw.    This time I opted for the nutella and banana crepe. The place is always stuffy and warm which is fine but on a warm afternoon or could take away from the place.   I ordered and sat upstairs to wait for my treat. The seating upstairs looks out over St. Catherine's so you can do some good people watching or in my case lady watching. The crepe comes quickly. Despite my low expectations this one was very good. Lots of nutella and I'd say probably 2 whole bananas on the thing. It is served warm and you could have it for a dessert or a breakfast if you wanted to. They also offer coffees and or teas and other things to wet your palate.   This place is worth a trip and I could see it increasing your chances getting lucky with a lady or fella if you are into that sort of thing if you take them here."}
{"text":"Yelp warned us but we didn't listen.  Overpriced crepes that were mediocre at best. No one in my group was impressed. I tried 3 different types and none of them were that great. This was the only disappointing meal during our visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Crêpes moyennes, les saveurs sont décevantes par rapport à mes attentes..  Paris crêpes n'a rien avoir avec les crêpes parisiennes.  Les prix sont excessivement cher par rapport à la qualité de la crêpe.."}
{"text":"At the very end of Crescent Street in busy downtown Montreal is this small but bustling cafe. Stop in from some shopping on the avenue Sainte-Catherine. You can get a decent crepe here with some hot or cold coffees, which you will be rushed into ordering at the counter, and you will get it delivered to you as you take a seat. Expect crowds and you may as well just go upstairs and grab a seat and wait a bit. The food is fine ---my Nutella and strawberry crepe, with the creme chantilly--was delicious and substantial. The iced mochas were great too, and just what we needed to get back on the street to shop at the Puma store and the Tristan store down the street."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a Francophile.  So when vacationing in Montreal we had to get crepes it was more then a want it was a need.   I had fallen off the crepe bandwagon many years ago, due to having soggy crepes served to me at outdoor carnivals like the Pittsburgh Arts Festival, but Paris Crepe has won me back.  I ordered the strawberry crepe and instead of being stuffed with strawberry flavored jelly it was actually loaded up with real fresh cut strawberries.   The crepe was expertly made and held it's shape well and the warmness of the crepe melted the nutella into the strawberry. It was Heaven on a plate.  My hubby ordered the caramel apple crepe. Wam bam thank you ma'am I'm talking flavor overload.   This was a meal where I actually savored and paused between each bite."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service, greeted with a menu and a smile when we entered. We had our food within 15 minutes and it was delicious! My husband had the roast beef, mushroom and ancho-chipotle which was DELICIOUS! Next time I'm getting that one! Not that my strawberry and Nutella one wasn't just as amazing, maybe next time I'll order both?!"}
{"text":"The Nutella and banana crepe is to die for! The crepe Suzette was just so-so. They have too many coffee options that are not listed on a menu."}
{"text":"We love crepes and were recommended to ths place, what a disappointment, Really disappointing, over priced, , dirty , dirty place, I guess the department of health never inspects. Take a pass....."}
{"text":"Expensive crepes but a fun treat once in a while. They aren't that special but it is convenient if you're feeling like a crepe.  The service is fine and the location is nice. When you eat from the top balcony in the summer, it's a nice place to relax."}
{"text":"Very bad experience at this cafe . I was waiting for 10min for a ketchup. Also it is very expensive."}
{"text":"Love their crepes and no nonsense sandwiches. Espresso drinks are great too.   Great place to bring a laptop,  enjoy brunch / late night cake and watch beautiful people passing by on St Catherine."}
{"text":"A pretty bad place altogether. Staff look like unpaid student with the minimal English/French requirements, although with a friendly attitude. The crepes are extremely pricey, quality is not there and ingredients look like they're coming right out of a box. I highly recommend going somewhere else whatever your budget!"}
{"text":"I went here while my friends and I were in Montreal for the weekend recently and all six of us had a great experience. The food was fantastic, the service was friendly and quick, there was a good deal of seating upstairs. It was so quaint and cozy, with a large window view of the main street from upstairs. I had the nutella and strawberry crepe one day, and then we had to go back for more, and so I had the nutella and ricotta cheesecake crepe (my birthday cake to myself) and they were both to-die-for! If you're in the area, this is a must!"}
{"text":"This place is great! So cute and cozy, i sat upstairs and got great service. You order your food and then the servers bring it up to wherever you are sitting. The coffee was also great. You are able to customize your crepes however you like with the ingredients listed on the menu. I took Belgian chocolate with strawberries and bananas; definitely a great combination. Would return to this great relax environment.   My only negative point was that the music was too loud."}
{"text":"Je suis allée deux fois avec mes amis. Les crêpes sont super bonne et elles ne sont pas aussi chère que ça. Par contre, l'endroit est quand même petit. Je vous conseille Nutella et fromage"}
{"text":"I did not have high but good expectation for their Crepes before I walked in. It was an easy process you line up to order and pay and then you find yourself some seats. Your food will be then brought up to your table upstairs.  We ordered one savory egg, cheese & spinach crepe and one sweet, sugar and cinnamon crepe. Also a plain butter croissant to taste.  Croissant was fresh and buttery  and we both really enjoyed that.  Now for crepes sweet one was overly dry and so much batter used for crepe that it tasted horrribleeee!! I had to chew for a while before I can swallow a piece. They should change the way make this particular dish by adding creme or custard or something so its not sooo chewy and dry. Now for the egg, cheese and spinach crepe, it was better than sweet one for sure. But i dont understand why they would use so much batter for their crepes and not use any kind of sauce it makes everything so dry. So our egg  yolk really helped with this one. I have had lot better crepes in express crepe shops in mall so this was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Not the best crepe place in Montreal but its okay if youre in the area and too lazy to find something else."}
{"text":"Ran in from the ran...wish I was wet rather than eating this.  The crepe is very dry and is brownish in color.  The person that I ordered from didn't know the name of the dish I wanted.  Its a very cute location, but that's the best about it."}
{"text":"While on vacation, i stopped in to try a crepe. I was one of the worst crepes I ever had. It is the fast food version of a crepe. Look for another spot folks."}
{"text":"Jonesing for an Americano and some sort of sweet breakfast pastry, I headed into Cafe Paris, and was immediately on cloud 9 thanks for their vast crepe selection. I was subsequently elated to pick the Nutella and Banana crepe - if you have lived in Europe you know that Nutella is health food anyway....  I ordered up and within a few minutes I was merrily sitting with my Americano (which was just okay), and a little taste of heaven in crepe form. My friend had the coconut and sugar crepe which was also fantastic. This place ranks very high on my breakfast list!"}
{"text":"Made my way to Paris Crepe with six other friends on our most recent trip to Montreal - A few of them had been there on the previous trip and had a good experience there and it seemed perfect for a quick breakfast before we split up and explored the city.  We proceeded to make our way down St. Catherine's street and walked into this bustling spot - Immediately to our right, as we walked in was a counter where we each took turns ordering our crepes. I settled for a simple yet always delicious banana and chocolate crêpe - a classic. I disposed of a few dollars and proceeded to walk upstairs to wait for my crêpe to be brought to me by the staff and to join a couple of tables together so that all seven of us could sit together.  The crêpes were pretty tasty, and quite filling - The chocolate was good and they carefully plated the thing and decorated it neatly - It looked good and tasted even better although it was a bit unevenly cooked and some bites were chewier than others...  The staff wasn't all that friendly but the prices were decent and the food hit the spot. The place was clean but lacked any kind of atmosphere - It was simple and very steril. Would I go back there? Maybe, for a quick pick me up but I doubt that I'd go out of my way for it as it simple wasn't all that worth it."}
{"text":"True parisian style, sloooooow service. And the menu board had sandwiches on it, but after waiting 20 minutes to order we find out they are only available during the week.... Big pile of ants on the floor to boot. One to skip..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. You would think that other than Paris - the place you can expect to have a good crepe would be Montreal. No such thing here.   The sugar/butter crepe was more sugar than any other ingredient. I ate half in the hopes that it would get better - but that didn't happen.   There were 4 people manning the shop. As 1 girl made the crepes, her friend stood next to her chomping on a sandwich right there in plain sight. Not the most appealing sight to watch her chomp, chew and chat.   After deciding that the crepe was a lost cause altogether, I went to throw it out and mentioned to the cashier that it had way too much sugar. She looked surprised and responded with \"oh really.\"  No offers for them to remake it. Not that I would've accepted it but still - that's the bare minimum they should've done.   If you are looking for a\"Paris Crepe\" this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"I've only ever had dessert crepes here but they were divine. Nutella, strawberries and ice cream for me please. mmmm. Their cappuccino was also quite tasty."}
{"text":"We visited Paris Crepes, but were very disappointed, we wished it was as beautiful inside as outside, the waiters barely spoke english, we gave the order on the main floor and went to sit on the second floor, our order was almost given to an other table .. Poor communication and organisation .. They should step their game up as they have allot of competition around ... We had crepes and hot drinks, the mugs were very dirty and the dark chocolate of poor quality, definately not worth the stop, i recommend you walk 2 extra blocks and stop by Cacao 70 or Juliette & Chocolat !"}
{"text":"We stumbled into Paris Crepes on our way back to our B&B and it was one of the best desserts I had in Montreal. I had the crepe with strawberries and bananas (possibly raspberries as well) in some sort of light caramel sauce and my hubby had a crepe with Nutella (boring!). My beautiful fruit crepe was amazing and we owe a debt to the girl at the cash register because DH was considering one of the manufactured looking brownies and cakes and she warned him away and directed us towards the crepes which were way better and fresh! If only you were a country away :'(  Definitely go there and get yourself an amazing crepe from some very pleasant people!"}
{"text":"i came here to grab a crepe since there was a line out the door.. it looked promising.. although my roast beef and mushroom crepe was good.. it wasn't 12 dollars good.. it definitely could have used more beef and shrooms.."}
{"text":"What a cute little place this was.  Spend a few days in montreal last week for work and had some time to myself, so decided to walk through the Cresent/St. Catherine area. On my flight I had read an article about how delicious a Montreal bagel was so I decided I needed to have one even though the crepes smelled amazing! I had a delicious latte and my sesame bagel (that is how a montreal bagel comes - sesame) with cream cheese. I have to say, it was delicious, not sure what it is that makes it so good, but they are good!  My latte was good too! I actually found all the coffee I had in Montreal to be quite good compared to Los Angeles....who knew? Anyway, this is a small but charming little cafe. Hope to be back in Montreal again sometime for the crepes!"}
{"text":"It hurts to even give this place 1 star. WORST SERVICE EVER! it takes 25 minutes for a ham and cheese crepe ti be ready and they forget the sauce.   I once stopped by to get three bottles of water. They gave me 2 warm ones and a cold one. It took them 6 mins to get me 2 glasses of ice.   This place shouldn't be open, it's a crime."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared 2 sweet crepes, one dark Belgian chocolate and raspberries and one nutella ricotta cheesecake.  Both of them were absolutely delicious! I personally preferred the Belgian chocolate one because it was a little lighter than the cheesecake one. For the Belgian chocolate and raspberries, don't expect the whole crepe to be filled with raspberries, only the edge has the raspberries... So you'll have to ration yourself if you want some with every bite. The cheesecake crepe is literally a crepe with a chunk of cheesecake thrown on top, so it was a little heavy, I also thought it could have used a bit more nutella, anything can use a bit more nutella/chocolate really, but otherwise it was perfect. The service was fine, a little slow since there was only 2 people working, one to make the crepes and the other to serve so it did take a while for us to get our food. I would definitely go back, at least for the Belgian chocolate crêpe!"}
{"text":"Simply for the size of the menu the lack of Gluten Free chocolate or crepe ( rice, buckwheat, almond flour) is just a huge shame. More lactose free and gluten free options wouldn't be that hard at all.  2016- about 65% are lactose intolerant to some degree, 15% of population has gluten antibodies suspecting sensitivity and inflammation after digestion, 6% are gluten allergic intolerant sensitive because of the symptoms and some of them are completely intolerant due to celiac disease.    City of Paris, New York, Toronto,  have gluten free options in nearly every restaurant, cafe, bakery. Crepes, cakes, pastry, chocolate, and always GF macaroons...  Montreal restaurants are sooo behind."}
{"text":"We had to have crepes while we were in Montreal, so on the last day we decided to stop off here. This place is goooood. I got the chicken salad, spinach, and cheese crepe. It was frikkin AMAZE! Like so good! my mouth was jumping with joy hahaha. It was filling and delicious and all the right things. I would for sure come back here again and again! WOuld like to try a dessert crepe one time. The odd thing though was that mine was folded up into a sqaure shape....never seen a crepe served that was before lol  My one complaint: There are 2 levels, but only the downstairs where you order has AC. When we got there the seat downstairs were full so we had to sit upstairs and it was HOT. Not cool- no pun"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the one- and two-star reviews are about. Sure, I wasn't blown away by their chicken salad crepe, but for a midnight snack it was plenty fine - plenty of chicken and cheese oozing from a lightly sweet, supple crepe. Definitely satisfied my craving for something warm and savory.  Staff are friendly, quick on filling orders, and have okay English. Facilities are clean despite not being fancy - rather like that of an old after-school hangout instead of a downtown restaurant. I wouldn't be averse to coming back, though there are better options for nighttime noms in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by Paris Crepes my first morning in Montreal for a late breakfast.  I walked in and there were two employees behind the counter - neither of whom could be bothered to greet me or offer any assistance.  I arrived at the cash register where the cashier just looked at me until I placed my order - a cafe au lait and a crepe with apples, cinnamon and caramel.  I placed my order, paid and sat at a table.  The cashier brought out my cafe au lait and it was terrible - completely undrinkable.  It tasted burnt.  While I waited for the crepe, I took note of the Starbucks across the street and thought about the vanilla latte I would be getting after I ate.  The crepe arrived a couple minutes later.  It looked beautiful.  Unfortunately, the filling was ice cold and the crepe was chewy and lukewarm at best.  Honestly, it tasted as if it had been reheated and given how quickly it arrived, this was probably the case.  Neither employee ever said another word to me and were nowhere to be found when I got done eating (I was hungry and had spent $17, so I powered through).  I'm sure the filling was not supposed to be cold, but I have no way to verify this.  I recommend avoiding Paris Crepes at all costs."}
{"text":"There is an upcoming wedding so I can't go to this place, but I can review and think about these crepes for sure!   Paris Crêpe is a Montreal gem, I have been there a bunch of times and tried most dishes on their menu.  My favorite would be the Bailey's crepe. It is creative and very different from the rest.  This place was recommended by a dear friend who was in this city and it has over-exceeded my expectations.  If you are in the city, make sure you visit this place (once at least). Take the seats upstairs and enjoy the view of all the street craziness.  Their nutella & strawberry crêpe is also exceptional.  Not the best place to go as a group, but definitely a date night dessert spot.   Highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I took the baileys and hazelnut crêpe and it was so good. The best is going in the summer I believe with the view on st-catherine and crescent, nice little breakfast that starts off the day well. As you'll see from my picture the latte and moka are also excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a nice simple place that gets packed really quickly. I'd recommend this place only because they are open late (about 2am) and their prices aren't absurd.  Other than that, the service is decent and relatively quick, but I don't think their behind the scenes process is very well refined. They had \"run out of dishes\" when their sink is just piled high with dishes. Their crepes are decent, though nothing to rave about. Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Yummy Crepe's! I got a banana and nutella. Delicious. My friend got a crepe with ham, egg, and cheese. Both were yummy. Will cost you around $8 USA but worth it.  The line was a bit long and there method was a not effiecient but they wraped it very well where nothing spilled or got wasted."}
{"text":"So,,,the service was great and the location is nice, sitting beside an open window looking out on the street, but the quality of the crepe was really poor. I ordered ham and cheese and the crepe was chewy and bland. Was it under cooked? After a few bites I left and had lunch elsewhere. Not close to the quality of a Montreal crepe."}
{"text":"If you are craving Nutella crepe without Nutella then this is the right place to go to. This is by far the worst crepe store, service is very slow, the charged $10 for a crepe with no Nutella! See the picture attached."}
{"text":"I love crepes so I've been here a few times. The savory crepes are a little shady. Once, when I was waiting for them to prepare my food, they had a loud discussion over whether or not they should use some old package of ham that had just expired. I had ordered a ham and cheese buckwheat crepe, so I felt a little apprehensive. Their sweet crepes are fine. Also, every time I've been here in warmer months the place is swarming with wasps who fly in through the windows and crawl on your sugary dessert."}
{"text":"frozen raspberries.   ordered the dark chocolate raspberry crepe. well, i wouldnt exactly call it a crepe as much as -- \"CRAPPPPP! \"   just a sad plate with a few token shriveled raspberries tossed  on it drisseled with hard to screwup-tasty-chocolate.  unremarkable in taste and presentation.  i've gotten better crepes here in santa cruz, ca.  oo-la....meh  \"oh Gark-on! Gark-on!\""}
{"text":"I ordered the Nutella and Strawberry crepe, my boyfriend ordered the lemon and sugar crepe. It came to 17.20$ worth the money. It was so good!"}
{"text":"Really awesome crepes with good prices. The location is very convenient as it is on Rue St Catherine and close to all of the major shopping centers. Service was very friendly and quick! I was able to utilize the free wifi too. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"I think this place must have gone down hill since the other reviews were written or the chef quit or something because this place was not good at all. Nothing really stood out as absolutely horrible, but there was just nothing good about it. Plus the prices were outrageous for what it was.  We got escargot for an appetizer and were very disappointed by the quality and quantity of the dish.  My wife got a beef filet and received a very overdone chunk of meat with some fries. When she asked for ketchup the waitress practically rolled her eyes.  I got boeuf bourguignon and it was just not good at all. I'm not very picky when it comes to boeuf bourguignon either. The meat was dry (difficult to accomplish in a stew) and the wine in the sauce tasted like it hadn't been properly reduced.  Our waitress was also not exactly a charmer. Her attitude was the only thing authentically French about the place aside from the price tag.   Go elsewhere, there are plenty of other French cafes in Montreal."}
{"text":"after reading the reviews of higher rated critics, maybe the sweet crepes are the winners here.  i wouldn't know though.  normally at a creperia i would order one savory and then one sweet for dessert but i was so disappointed in the ham n cheese crepe i couldn't even finish it.  the cheese tasted like Velveeta cheese (for those unfamiliar with Velveeta, it's the most processed and non-cheese tasting cheese of all American cheeses ever made). completely unappealing \"cheese\" product. I ordered a side of creme fraiche and what i was given was (to the best i could tell) a cross between vinaigrette dressing and thousand island. after sending it back and rerequesting the \"white sauce for crepes, creme fraiche\", i was given a processed version of ranch dressing. :( Sorely disappointed!  and it's not cheap either. for my crepe and an OJ, it ran me $18  -side note, no wi-fi either, so i don't know why you'd want to even bring your laptop in to do some work with a coffee either."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Crescent, this delectable gem offers a fantastic menu of made-to-order crepes. I had a heavenly one that had dark Belgian chocolate, Bailey's Irish Creme and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. One word mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Cost was about $11.50 CAN. Well worth it. Seating here is limited downstairs but there is more seating if you follow the back staircase to the loft above."}
{"text":"Pretty good crepes and chill personable atmosphere of you want to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice this month. Love the variety of crepes they have. The physical environment of this place is not ideal. On a hot day, they would open the windows on the upper floor to let some fresh air in, otherwise, the place would be boiling hot. Their washrooms (total of 2 unisex stalls) are located in the basement. It's a bit creepy and inconvenient."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the strawberry, banana, dark chocolate crepe!  Very good!"}
{"text":"The place is way overpriced for What i got. I understand that theyre located right in the middle of downtown but the food was really just average. I tried the Volcano, which just had brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on the side. Took me less than 5 minz to finish because the brownie had coconut and some other stuff in it (I hate coconut) and the ice cream serving was just small. I gave an extra star for the fast service and the really nice presentation, because first when you look at the plate first, mouth starts watering automatically. BUT, definitely was not worth 7-8$ that i paid excluding taxes.   Tip: only come here when you're in downtown with no where else to go..... and with big $$s to spare"}
{"text":"We just finish our dinner at Mirage Mediterranean food and went for a walk looking for a place to have a hot tea in this snowy weather . Paris crepe stood out from the name. We got hot green tea, chai tea and a strawberry and banana crepe. All taste good. The place has a cozy feeling and a great ambiance ."}
{"text":"I felt like I am in Paris. The crepes were delicious. We got Nutella strawberries and Nutella crepes and it was delicious. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised the low star reviews, my experience was pretty decent. I ordered an omelet and it was pretty yummy. Watching the crepes be prepared is cool and they tasted pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of crepes but someone from our table ordered the Nutella and banana, I'm not big on sweets for breakfast. Service was ok and aside from it sweltering upstairs, I thought this place was good."}
{"text":"This was my first stop into the heart of Montreal on my most recent trip. I honestly love this restaurant for its cozy atmosphere and the delicious kinds of crepes they had to offer. We ordered one savoury crepe (ham and cheese) and one sweet (nutella and strawberry) crepe. The cashier took our orders and told us to go upstairs to find a table where they would bring our crepes. This restaurant is two floored building located on a corner intersection.  When we walked upstairs, there were an assortment of wooden tables and chairs placed around the floor. We picked one near the window which gave us a good view of Sainte-Catherine. It less than 10 minutes, we had our crepes and were munching on them in delight. The ham and cheese crepe was crispy and the cheese was evenly melted on the ham. As for the sweet crepe, the fresh strawberries tasted absolutely amazing with the nutella. It was nice and warm too, so it was very heartwarming and comforting to have. I highly recommend this crepe restaurant if you get a chance to go!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a breakfast crepe. Went to Paris Crepes for something sweet and savory. I decided on the ham and cheese crepe. The ham was this and wasn't salty at all. The cheese was gooey and flavorful. Together with that good ole Canadian maple syrup, I really enjoyed each and every bite.  I couldn't get enough of the technique that it takes to make them. The lady did a great job. They have all kinds of crepes (breakfast, sweet and savory)."}
{"text":"So many tourist reviews on here! This place is sooo popular, it's in a prime location. The crepes themselves are good, but nothing special. Very overpriced. When you order a chocolate crepe with bananas and strawberries, it's basically just nutella and very thinly sliced fruits you barely get a full mouth feel. And that'll cost you around 12$.  There are other places in town that'll serve your similar crepes, like Yeh!, the frozen yogourt shop actually serves the exact same thing for a fraction of the price. Juliette and Chocolat, another hotspot for dessert lovers will use real chocolate, not that processed nutella spread.  I've tried their cheesecake as well at Paris Crepe which was very good, but everything is just too expensive for what you're getting. There's nothing authentic or french about it either. The place is run and owned by Asians, not french people."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here for a quick brunch on a Saturday. The place was very small as we entered but were greeted by friendly staff.  We ordered omelettes and coffee. The omelette was fine but was a bit dry and salty. I thought the coffee tasted fine but my girlfriend thought the flavor was a bit off.  The real issue with the place is that the seating upstairs was almost unbearably hot. There is an opening that looks down over the serving area downstairs and the heat rises up without any noticeable air conditioning. It's possible that this was a one-time event but it made our experience a bit difficult to enjoy."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that my breakfast croissant (which was served with egg, ham, spinach and cheese) was okay.   The fellow at the next table was happy to learn that they have free internet access.  Maybe I'd be a bigger fan if I had brough my computer along."}
{"text":"Hi. I agree with the many comments regarding improper service and price.   Here's my story about this place, which we will never visit again:  Cashier girl, horrible service. Couldn't care less, so little that she carelessly put my coffee on the dirty tray but placed it on the lip, having it almost spill all over my red coat. Our order wasn't big, and she absentmindedly forgot that we ordered water also. No coffee fixings were given to me when I initially ordered the coffee so I had to get up again to go back downstairs to get the milk / sugar, no sooner after I sat down on the second floor. When I first ordered, I noticed the top tray she was giving me was really dirty and sticky. I politely picked up the next few underneath hoping one of those would be cleaner, but no, all the ones I saw were sticky & dirty.  Customers who arrived AFTER us were receiving their orders before my husband and I. We waited about 45 minutes for two breakfast SANDWICHES. No, that is correct, we did not even order a Crepe because we found the prices to be too expensive.   Paris Crepe is a HUGE disappointment. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"There is NOTHING remotely resembling a crepe from France at \"Paris Crepes\" in Montréal.   In the mood for a crepe, I stopped in and asked for the most basic crepe: butter and sugar. This was $5. FIVE DOLLARS for basically 4 tablespoons of milk, flour and egg.   Oh, best part - if you want to eat it there and sit down? It's Six Dollars - for ONE crepe.  I asked the delightfully dim girl behind the register if the $5 crepe was particularly good, soaked in Brandy or had some other reason it was so pricey. Blank stare. No answer.  Silly me, I fell for it and shelled it out to satisfy my curiosity and hunger.  It was palid, undercooked, tasteless and very, very moist. Very little butter, a light sprinkling of sugar and that's it.  Best of all, the \"chef\" folded it in thirds and then wrapped it completely in newsprint - ensuring the delicate taste of newsprint had permeated into the crepe by the time he handed it to me, lo some 15 seconds later.   It tasted like paper. I wanted to spit it out.  You know, in Paris, they use a small newspaper cone so your hands don't get greasy - but because the crepe is cooked slightly crispy, with lots of butter and usually has a dash of some liquor. It works and soaks up the grease.  This does not. It works the other way and the paper flavor goes into the moist, undercooked crepe.  Anyway, this has all the makings of a tourist trap owned by some well-to-do family who bought it from the original owner and has NO CLUE on how to run a restaurant. My guess.  Avoid."}
{"text":"We had the nutella and the nutella with raspberry crepes and they were both amazing. It was crunchy and soft, both at the same time, which is the definition of a perfectly cooked crepe for me.   Furthermore, I have realized that they have used the nutella and the raspberry in generous amounts, much much more than the competitors' usage, and at a much more cheaper price point than them.   In addition to all above, the service was great. The lady at the cashier was super nice to us, and the 2 guys making the crepes near the window was so careful and had attention to detail, while they also greeted you and said goodbye when you left which made the place really cozy.   The only downside is that the place is small, I recommend that you just grab a seat in the first floor, and dont even bother going to the second as it is, in my opinion a bit cramped and doesn't have that much lighting.   But overall, it was the best crepe I ate in Montreal; it had generous amount of the ingredients, really cheap, great service, perfect location."}
{"text":"This is a cute little creperie on Ste. Catherine, which we stopped in at for a bite, while shopping.   The bottom floor is mostly dominated by the counter, with a couple of small tables. The second floor is all tables, with lots of windows giving a nice view of the street, and an open balcony concept, that allows you to look down on the bottom floor.   This place is mainly counter service, though if you're eating in, they'll bring your crepe to your table when it's ready (drinks are picked up at the counter when you order.)  They have a rather extensive menu with lots of options. Some of the crepes have a different price if you're doing take out vs eating in, though others are the same price for both.   I ordered the spinach egg & cheese crepe and a London Fog. The crepe was nice - good thickness and texture and the batter was fairly neutral - not salty, not sweet. It complimented the filling very nicely. The egg was scrambled and kind of cooked onto the crepe like a coating, which was a rather nice way of combining it, and the cheese was plentiful and melty. The spinach could have been cooked slightly more but overall it was really good and quite filling.  The London Fog was the best I've ever had. I don't know what they did differently from other places, but it was really amazingly good. Mmm, I want one right now.  I quite enjoyed eating here. I'd like to go back and try one of their sweet crepes. They also had some wrapped dessert squares by the till - I don't know what they were exactly but they looked to die for. I was wishing I wasn't quite so full when I saw them."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot. It is consistent. The flavour is pretty good and in a very convenient location for downtown tourists. Good for a quick reasonably priced snack or meal in the downtown area. Dessert crepes are better, try it with ice cream or cheesecake."}
{"text":"Paris Crêpes is located right in downtown Montréal on the corner of Sainte Catherine's and Rue Crescent.  Always my favorite place to go for a nice treat when I'm in Montréal. There are many different styles of crêpes to choose from and I believe they are open daily until midnight. After a certain time they only do take-out. There are two levels inside where you can sit against the windows and enjoy people watching.  My favorite crêpe is the Nutella and cheese. Seems like a weird combination, but it worked perfectly. They have many styles of crêpes such as dessert crêpes, breakfast crêpes, ham and cheese, etc. The menu has MANY combinations! The fruit is fresh and it seems like a lot of the toppings are made in house.  Pricing seems to be an issue for people and at $10+ a crêpe. I guess it's a bit much, however the quality is worth it in my opinion. I seemed to go at slower times (late night, mid afternoon) so maybe my crêpes were made with more consideration. Unlike other reviews, the texture was pleasant and the crêpe itself was not underdone nor overdone.  If you enjoy crêpes, want a little snack or a dessert, Paris Crêpes is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Cozy little bistro with ample seating with great views upstairs.  Crepes Saisson with roast beef, mushrooms and cheese were delicious.  Kids had Nutella everything and loved it. Cafe au Lait was worth the walk."}
{"text":"This place is a-ok!  They have seating upstairs but seems like you'd want to come here and get a crepe to do which is what we did.  They have sandwich and other dessert options (like cheesecake) but I didn't try those.  While in Montreal I came here a couple of times to pick up a crepe before heading back to the hotel.  They have all the delicious options both savory and sweet.  Late hours too."}
{"text":"we were strolling down the shopping area of montreal on rue st catherine on an early morning in the summer when we stopped in for some authentic french crepes! we ordered two and had left over as they are pretty large. i prefer my crepes on the crispier side but it was good nonetheless! i would definitely come back when i'm in montreal again!"}
{"text":"I have this every time I go to Montreal. It is literally a must. The layout is kinda weird, you place your order then go take a seat. The main seating area is upstairs, but I actually kind of like it like that. It's not a big place, and they usually have 4 people on staff; 1 as cashier & to take orders, 1 to cook, 1 to clean, & 1 to prepare small stuff & deliver the food to your table. It's a pretty efficient system, but the thing is that the cleaner usually cleans downstairs and so it's really up to the deliver-er to bus the tables upstairs. It would probably be easier if people threw out their garbage & put their plates in some sort of bin, but there isn't much room so I suppose things will stay how they are. I always get the nutella-banana crepe, I might be obsessed, but it's definitely worth the $8.50."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend! The woman making the crepes was touching the batter with her bare hands, as well as turning and folding the crepes with her hands... When my husband approached the manager and asked if she could wear gloves to make our crepes, her rude response was, \"why?\" Lol... WHY? Uhhhhmmmm... Enough said. We asked for a refund and were directed to stand back in line to get our money back from the cashier. After some insistence, we finally got her to give back our money and left."}
{"text":"Cute, small place. We went in just to share a crepe. We ordered a Nutella and Strawberry Crepe. It was good, but i felt they were lacking in the chocolate. They didn't have a ton of choices. Service was friendly. They were quick. We may be back if ever in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a late breakfast. Super cute place, and service was quick.  Ordered two egg and cheese Crêpes , as well as a Nutella and banana crêpe.  The egg and cheese ones were average at best. But at least the egg was well done. The Nutella and Banana was really good.   Not a bad place, if you're looking for somewhere new. However it appears there are lots of better places for Crêpes in Montreal."}
