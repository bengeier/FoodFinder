{"text":"Well priced but half the rice was undercooked and other half was cooked. Chicken Burrito was soggy and didn't even taste all that good.  I'll try tacos next time."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw the cheerful sign go up on Sheppard and even more happy when I tried the food! Delicious nachos and friendly friendly service! Mary-lou is a wonderful hostess. I crave this stuff!"}
{"text":"Run, don't walk to this place. Seriously. If you are ever in the area, go check out what Marilu has to offer. I used to live right in the area and now it is about an hour bus ride away from me and I still go visit her once every 2 weeks if not more!  Now on to the actual food. Wow, this stuff is super fresh. Everything except the tortillas is made by Marilu herself and it all tastes like homemade delciousness. For the amount of food you get (I have a picture posted of her large burrito with a soda can for scale) the prices are fantastic! Her large burrito is $9 ($7.97 + tax) and when you finish that thing you are very nice and full!!! Of course i have to say something about her guacamole...well there's a reason she chose the name, delicious! I have a friend who I introduced to the place whose wife LOVES guac and he went to buy a bowl of it for her and she has sent him back numerous times since (as well as going for herself) for the fresh guacamole and chips alone!  Please note that Marilu makes her hot sauce with real, fresh habanero and as such it is spicy! I enjoy it quite a bit but if you think Frank's Red Hot is spicy you're gonna wanna stick with the medium  The menu being so simple is great if you're going to take someone/people who can't ever decide what they want when presented with a menu which is pages long. She even has beer and many flavors of Jarritos available. I don't think there is wine but I clicked \"Beer & wine available\" on the Yelp survey question.  I bring friends here as often as I can and everyone I have brought has fallen in love with the tastiness of this place. If you're in the area going to Downsview Park for a concert or event, note that this place is a 13 minute walk from TTC Downsview Station. Perfect for dinner before heading over to the park!  ProTip: If you're getting a (large) meat burrito you can ask Marilu to do half of one and half of another.   Ya it's in a run down strip plaza but who cares when the food is this good? Writing this review is making me super hungry for some of her food. I'll likely be going again this week...wanna come?"}
{"text":"Great food! Restaurant is clean and parking in front is super convenient. Service was friendly and she even offered up the suggestion to add a burrito sauce which was excellent and added a little extra zing.  Food was fresh and yummy. I had a chicken burrito and it was flavourful. My friend had vegetarian tacos which were also good.  Food made in front of you to order.  Pricing is very good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A group of us from the office came here for lunch. We all had the meat tacos. The consensus was that we all really enjoyed the food. Fresh ingredients. The beef was our favorite meat. The service was fast. We were told that there is fish on Fridays. My colleague was really happy to discover they serve beer. Great to have a place like this in the neighborhood we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok here's the scoop. This place is in a bit of an odd spot, it looks to be closed even when it's open (needs more lights!). Waiting time is longer than necessary due to there only being 1 person there, but that one person is the Owner and she is lovely to talk to if its not busy. I've only ordered the burritos, but my boyfriends had the tacos l, and we both agree that she's got a good thing going there. The burritos are giant and full of flavours (could be a teeeeeeny tiny bit crispier on the exterior) but overall, a good local dinner experience. The place could be jazzed up a little more, and with an extra server or two, this place will be rockin."}
{"text":"Really great, fresh food.  Staff was very, honestly friendly.  We met a guy there who was coming back the second time today."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! From the nachos to the soft shell tacos everything is fresh and authentic. The owner, Marilu, is amazing and service is quick and friendly. This is so good that I am here 3 times a week. The only criticism I have is that it is not open Sundays and Mondays!"}
{"text":"Based on the Yelp reviews, I checked out this place with a few friends last night.  The first thing we were surprised about is this is a quick-service restaurant (no servers) - not that it's inherently a bad thing.  I ordered a burrito and guacamole.  The burrito was pretty good, not amazing, but I'd order it again.  The guacamole was another story.  It tasted like it was just mushed up avocado with no spicing at all.  Very bland.  The friends I was eating with also said the same thing.  For a place with Guacamole in their name, I expected better.  The biggest issue though is I felt nickel and dimed to death here.  Want cheese on the burrito?  Extra $.75.  Sour cream?  Another $.75.  Salsa?  $.75.  Even worse though was purchasing chips and salsa or guacamole as a side.  A side of salsa (a very small cup) was $2 - and it didn't even come with chips.  They were another $2.  For a burrito, chips & guacamole and a soda, my total was almost $15.  That's a bit more than I expect to spend at a quick-service restaurant - for $15 I could have had a meal at a more traditional sit-down Mexican restaurant.  Based on the number of 5-star reviews, combined with my experience, I have to wonder if some of the reviews are shill-reviews here.  The food wasn't bad - but it doesn't justify the many 5-star ratings here - especially when you take the price into account.  If it was nearby, I might go back (but would skip the side of chips and guac/salsa!), but it's kind of out of the way, so it's unlikely I will return."}
{"text":"A gem in the North York suburbs. Very fresh and tasty Mexican authentic flavours. Tacos, burritos and quesadilla are all filled with great looking quality veggies and the meat (shredded chicken, ground beef, steak) is all seasoned very nicely with authentic flavours.  Staff is very friendly and care about each meal. Great price and they serve beer now."}
{"text":"In one word: authentic. The food was delicious and the portions were gargantuan. Considering how affordable this place is, I can't believe this is the first review for it. The staff, whose names I unfortunately didn't get, were both tremendously gracious and kind. Don't let the minimalist interior design fool you, the proof is in the pudding."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Mexican food I have had in TO. Mary-Lou is a fantastic cook and provides large and delicious portions!"}
