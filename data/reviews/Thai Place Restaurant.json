{"text":"I just moved to Shadyside and have been looking for a good spot for asian take-out.  This will not be it.  After a long day running errands, I picked up some take-out at Thai place.  The pad thai was blah: consisting of noodles and chicken, with a meager sprinkling of peanuts, and the portion was small considering that it cost $13!  Given the poor performance on a staple dish, I won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"When I'm feeling so lazy that I don't want to leave Shadyside (i.e., the entire freaking winter) yet I want Thai food, Thai Place is the only option.  Their Pad Thai is merely so-so, but their curries (especially the panang) are delicately spiced and flavorful.  Unfortunately, the prices are high and the portions are not very generous.  There's better Thai in Pittsburgh, just not in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Thai Place has a big sign out on the sidewalk noting their \"best 10 in the US\" Thai restaurant rating.  Perhaps that was true in the early 2000's when the reviews were all written - see for yourself if you walk into the front door as they're posted on the wall.  Obviously the original chef left and the place likely changed hands as well since that time period, because this restaurant is a total waste of time and money.  I met my wife there for lunch on a recent Wednesday; the fact that we were the only patrons in the establishment should have set off alarm bells but our Thai food low lights were blazing brightly so we decided to give it a try.  The Pad Thai, our baseline dish for evaluating any Thai restaurant, was below average, and lacked any color such as some green onion or carrot to make the dish more presentable.  Overall flavor was absolutely boring, but they did get the spice level right; the 1- 10 scale they offered and the 6 they served were right on the money - can't fault them for that.  It's a has-been restaurant trying to get by on a reputation earned over a decade ago, with bored servers and uninspired food.  Shadyside has plenty of other places to eat; you can go try I Tea Cafe for similar style food for the same money (my plan for the coming week).  Life is just too short to eat crappy food in a dead restaurant; I might as well have lit a $20 bill on fire for the thrill it provided."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty.  The wait staff is okay.  I really like the Chicken Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Great taste. But too expensive for the very small serving sizes they give you. After paying $15 dollars I left very hungry. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Over priced, small portions, and musky old look. I will never go there again. If you like over priced decent enough food go here."}
{"text":"In short, horrible service, and the attitude is not one that supports the notion of \"the customer is always right\". I had been here before so I thought I could come here with a group of friends for dinner. I should say, it's not the same restaurant I had been to before. Firstly, it took a while for the waitress to take our orders. We told her we needed a moment to think about what we're getting but she took a while and, afterwards, ignored us for the rest of the night. The food took about an hour (after ordering) and one of my friends even got the wrong dish. The manager was defensive to our complaints, saying the restaurant was \"busy\". There were only 2 other small groups of people in the restaurant, and they had gotten their meals before we even ordered, so we did not know what he was talking about. I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst meals ever ... $65 for two people for crap. The issue was not the price but rather that the food was so bad I barely touched the pad Thai but got charged  for it nonetheless !!! The chicken smelled of raw/ boiled chicken...no flavor whatsoever .. No issues with the service except they did not have the presence of mind to comp the horrendous pad Thai !!!this is coming from a chef and a former restaurant owner .. I am being completely honest and objective ... One of the worst meals I have ever had !!"}
{"text":"I tend to prefer this location of Thai Place because it is always so quiet.  The menu seems to be identical to that of the Walnut Street location.    All of the curry dishes are good here, as are some of the simpler dishes.  I especially like the Penang curry, and the sauce for the chicken with garlic is excellent.  They also include a lot of really good, fresh vegetables in all of their dishes, which, to me, is a plus.  While I haven't tried many of them, the chef's specials seem to be very original to the restaurant.   The service is always prompt and excellent.  The only drawback to that I can think of is that the prices are a bit high, compared to other Thai restaurants.  However, I always leave Thai Place feeling pleased and satisfied."}
{"text":"The food is a little pricey and is decent Thai food. It's consistent, and the service has been very good every time I've been there. I don't go there when I want amazing Thai, but it's a great way to satisfy your Thai cravings in a convenient location. I've gotten the panang and pumpkin curries, as well as a few of the noodle dishes. It has always been decent but not great."}
{"text":"Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable."}
{"text":"given the close proximity to my house, i wish i could give this place a better review.  first of all, the entire menu is confusing... they don't serve many of the traditional thai dishes that you'd find in most thai restaurants.  i noticed a mix of chinese and other asian dishes, not thai.  the tom yum soup is the worst i've ever eaten... way too sweet.  they have hot and sour on the menu... again, i thought it was a thai restaurant, not chinese.    bummer."}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh, I grabbed take-out here on occasion only b/c it was right next to my apartment and very convenient if I needed to eat a late dinner coming home from school. I've tried a few noodle dishes and rice dishes and they're all very \"meh\". The larb was not even close to authentic larb - it was basically a green salad with ground meat. Additionally, this place is pricey for what you get.  Very uninspired and nowhere even close to \"Best 10 Thai restaurant in the US\" good as the sign they keep outside says. If you're looking for a Thai restaurant close by, Noodlehead is a half-mile walk away.  2 stars are for the service (the people there seem friendly enough, at least the waitresses up front) and location."}
{"text":"Great food, good value.  Thai spring rolls (veggie) were tasty.   Beef pad Thai (spice level 5) had a nice balanced flavor with just the right amount of heat.   Steamed chicken sweet and sour was loaded with fresh veggies.   Overall, very good food , highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming but surprisingly lovely restaurant in the Quality Inn hotel. The food is deliciously prepared and as authentic as it gets in \"the new West,\" as Calgary bills itself. The owner is a delightful woman named Juree, who owns a second Thai restaurant in town (I haven't been there) and a down-home bungalow retreat in the Thai countryside (I'd love to visit).  The food at Thai Place Restaurant is well prepared by Juree's young Thai cook, and she rightfully boasts of being \"picky\" about the food she serves, all her own recipes. My wife and I arrived late, at 9:30 PM, and we were very happy with our green curry and red pepper fish. Despite Juree's cautions, the fish was not at all too spicy -- in fact, it was relatively mild, and delectable. Ask Juree to tell you a little about her family: her parents were villagers who worked to send their six children to college. Juree worked for the Thai embassy in Jakarta for some years when she was younger, and among her harrowing experiences were efforts she made to rescue young prostitutes from brothel owners and pimps. Life in Calgary is decidedly more tame for her, although her food is not."}
{"text":"With a sign in front of the door saying they were one of the top 10 Thai restaurants in the country, I was expecting the earth and planets to move when I took my first bite. Nope. I would claim that they're not even in the top 10 in Pittsburgh. My pad thai was bland, small portions (for $9?!), and lonely without veggies, bean sprouts, or even really eggs. Someone else at the table had much better beef panang, but it also suffered from a lack of spice, even though he ordered it at an 8.   I also wasn't a fan of the service- we felt very rushed even though we got there an hour and a half before closing. We were given the check as I was still finishing my meal. :-p"}
{"text":"Like this Thai joint. The print tools are to DIE FOR. That's just the appetizer! I personally like kee mow. That's the Spicy Rice Noodle on the menu. They have a bar too."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with this place. Thought pad thai was pretty standard but it lacked flavor here. It was pretty spicy but not that enjoyable. However the spring rolls were pretty good and I enjoyed the Thai iced tea.   The service was alright and the environment was nice and friendly but I don't think I will make it my staple thai place."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time. So I thought I'd give it a try. Pop entering there were two people in the restaurant and it was 630 on a Friday night. I should've known better. So we all ordered the pad Thai. One person got the curry and liked it.  I ordered the pad Thai on a spice level number eight and it was not anything special. The only difference between spicy or not spicy with how much extra hot red pepper flakes they would sprinkle on top of the pad Thai.  The service was absolutely terrible. The waitress just was too young and inexperienced.  Would not go back anytime soon"}
{"text":"As a Shadyside resident, Thai Place is one of my go-to restaurants for both takeout and eat-in meals. I have always had wonderful, almost bordering on overly-attentive service, even when the restaurant is fairly full.  My absolute favorite dish is the Penang curry tofu. The tofu is served soft, but flavorful, with a sprinkling of vegetables, and an abundance of coconut milk-based Penang curry sauce. The sauce is consistently well-prepared, savory, and at my chosen spice level. My second favorite would be the Sizzling Tofu, a soft-fried tofu dish with a plethora of fresh crispy vegetables in a light brown sauce.  The only negative aspect of my review is that the prices are slightly higher for the volume of food received as compared to other similar local restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for both vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores. I'm vegan and the servers have always been willing to answer my questions, and work with me to ensure that my dish is made fresh and without the ingredients I choose not to consume."}
{"text":"Maybe we came at the wrong time but the service was very poor during lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. We had just completed a good yoga session and were very hungry. We decided to have Thai food and plugged in a Thai place close by. We arrived at Thai palace hoping to get good thai food. The Pad Thai dish was good but it took FOREVER to get in even a water order (which we most needed). Even after we got our food the wait staff was not attentive at all. I would like to say it was just me but other guests around me were having ordering issues too and it wasn't that crowded. They didn't have crushed red peppers either (how could you be a Thai restaurant without Thai peppers - OM Goodness). Good food, extremely poor service! Will not eat here ever again (it is sad to say). I recommend new or improved management -where ever you are."}
{"text":"I went to Thai Place for a quick dinner. I ordered the Penang Tofu, and they offer you a 1-10 spice scale. I picked an 8, because I normally do 4/5 or one step back from the comically spicy option. I was really disappointed with how it turned out. It was not even as spicy as the \"mild\" options are other Thai places I've been too.   So, the tofu was limp, the sauce was watery, the green peppers had been frozen (c'mon, we're entering pepper season right now) and the basil was wilting.  On the plus side, they had the cut carrots into fun star shapes with the centers bored out.  But alas, even the carrots were over-cooked.  I'll give it another shot and see if I can get an adequate spice level, and report back."}
{"text":"Thai fried rice was okay.  Nothing special with that dish.  Perhaps try the coconut curry instead."}
{"text":"I remember going here a long time ago and not really seeing anything that vaguely resembled Thai food on the menu.  Still, I remember the ruby quail being really good stuff.  A whole fried quail in this tasty red sauce and surrounded by vegetables."}
{"text":"The negative reviews surprised me--I go here fairly often and my only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep. They have great green curry, mango curry and their pad Thai is also quite good. Many people order food to pick up, so the place is never crowded. It's a relaxed atmosphere with attentive, friendly service."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I went with a couple friends who wanted to go shopping, and we all decided we were in the mood for Thai food. Of the two Thai restaurants on Walnut St., this was the first one we passed. I don't know what the other one's like, but I was really pleased with the service and the food at this place.  I had the Spicy Tofu dish (comes with rice) which was really tasty. I ordered the 5 (out of 10) spiciness, and it was just right. Not too spicy, but also not too mild. Our waiter was a pretty sweet dude from Thailand. How did I know that? I asked him where he got his sweet glasses, and he said, \"Back home in Thailand.\" I also noticed his rubber bracelet had Sanskrit on it.   The other people I was with also enjoyed their food, and at the end of the meal our waiter agreed to run all four meals on separate checks for us! That favor seems really rare in the U.S., so I've gotta give Thai Place an extra thumbs-up.  Go here and say hi to the dude with the sweet glasses!"}
{"text":"I thought it was very good. Met my Thai food expectations. Why isn't Thai iced tea in every restaurant?  That stuff is so good, why can you only get it at Thai restaurants??  Very, very friendly staff here.  I got the General Tso's (Thai style) chicken and it was great.   Got spring rolls for an appetizer and they were excellent. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Too expensive, small portions, taste was nothing special.    This was what bothered by the most:  we ordered 3 entrees, 3 appetizers, 2 deserts (total $75).  However, they had the nerve to charge us to chili sauce without telling us first there would be an extra charge.  They said they would only give us one serving (which was about 1 teaspoon worth) and when we asked for more, they charged us.  We told them, we ordered 3 meals, how can we only get 1 tiny spoon of chili sauce?  They said it was their owners policy.    There are so many other thai restaurants the the city with better tasting food (smiling banana leaf, nicky's thai). I will not go back here because they are overpriced and because of their greediness over chili sauce."}
{"text":"I don't get this place. Went here 3 times and ordered something different each time thinking I was missing something.  Nope. Food is bland and veggies seem like the were steamed in the microwave."}
{"text":"This little gem is delightful. The food is excellent and the Thai iced tea is amazing. The staff is very very friendly and helpful. I have celiac disease and they graciously accommodate my gluten free needs."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Thai Place for several years in Shadyside and Fox Chapel locations. The quality has been declining recently. Tonight I got a take-out order of Tofu Basil that was awful. It had no flavor, and no heat, in spite of me asking for an 8/10 spice level. The brown rice was dried out and tasted like it was made 8 hours ago. Some of the veggies were almost raw. There prices also were higher than the last time that I was there, which only added to the insult.  That was absolutely my last attempt at Thai Place. I went there today only because Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield was closed (Monday). It was by far the worst Thai food experience I have ever had, and I eat it often when I travel."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food.  Very friendly service and management.  Food is prepared promptly and is consistently good.  I wish that they DELIVERED!!  We eat their food often.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired, though."}
{"text":"Who uses soup egg noodles for phad see ew?   Wholly a disappointing experience.  Under spiced and over priced.  Sure the decor is pretty and the service is pretty good but that simply isn't enough to get three stars.  Probably not returning..."}
{"text":"Thai Place says they're one of the 10 best Thai Restaurants in the US, and the Pittsburgh City Paper and other magazines / newspapers have rated them as one of the best in town.  I have no idea who is voting, but that is ridiculous!    When I arrived to pick up my take out order, I noticed the place was vacant except for two couples at two tables.  The dish was overpriced and the portion was very small ($17.00 for a simple green curry w/beef and xtra serving of rice).  The sauce was bland and very watery. The beef was tough and the vegetables were way overcooked.     I've lived in the area for over 10 years and I've had their food a few times.  It's always disappointing.  After this meal, I decided to create a yelp account and post my thoughts..."}
{"text":"To be perfectly clear, I'm giving Thai Place's Pad Thai 5 stars. It's delicious. Huge portions, a little pricey, but the flavor is always consistent. I'd be hesitant to order anything else as other reviewers seem to have more negative things to say about Thai Place's other food options. Overall, it's my go-to takeout Pad Thai joint."}
{"text":"Let's see...the chicken in my curry was raw, the pad Thai was not edible, the pad see ewww had extra ewww.  I paid $53 for a meal none in my family could muster the strength to eat.  This is a poor excuse for Thai food and an even worse excuse for edible food.  Do not waste your time or money, there are much better Thai restaurants in squirrel hill and Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Expensive for the quality. They are very sparing on the amount of protein in their dishes. If you are looking for good quality Thai food go to Smiling Banana Leaf, Thai Me Up or Silk Elephant."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking: a good Thai food restaurant inside of a über generic Quality Inn? Don't let the awful location fool you. A friendly and chatty staff will make you feel at home and serve you a solid and tasty Thai experience.  The hotel ambiance maybe makes this a three-star establishment, but they get extra points for surprising you in the motel strip."}
{"text":"I live in shadyside where this restaurnat is located so it is very easy for me to go there.  I've been many times and the food is always good.  There are not a lot of thair restaurants in pgh for me to judge against, but I'd say that this is they best thai food I've tasted in pgh.  The service on the other hand can be a bit sketchy/disappointing.  On one visit I was extremely bothered by the fact that the waitress left one of her i pod earbuds in while taking out order.  If you can't be bothered to give your full attention to the customers then why are you doing this job.  Waitressing is in fact entirely customer service.  On another visit, I'm pretty sure they added on extra money to their tip after I signed the receipt which is pretty sketchy.  Though neither of these are deal breakers, they are diasppointing to find at a place with such good food."}
{"text":"I got some tasty tea... OK pad thai. My friend had a dish with veggies and shrimp... she liked it but wasn't raving about it.  On a really sour note, I almost choked on a piece of wire that was cooked into my food. That was really a disappointment considering all the little signs and posters inside the restaurant saying it's a \"TOP\" restaurant.   The service was pretty struggs... just a couple young kids busing the tables and working as the servers.   In case you couldn't gather... no I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"A few friends of mine and I tried to eat here in under an hour. The wait staff was helpful in getting us in and out quickly.   I realize that Pad Thai should not be the benchmark of every Thai restaurant, but it should be mentioned that this Pad Thai was fairly unremarkable. Lulu's is better and cheaper. They did, however, let us customize the spiciness of our meals from 1-10.  The gems of this meal were the appetizers: the chicken satay skewers and, more importantly, the curry puffs.  If you're looking for a light lunch, come for a glass of water and a couple of appetizers. That's affordable even for students."}
{"text":"The dishes taste fine. The rice is clumpy and very chewy toward the end of the day.   The portions are very small. I'm a 100lb weakling and still hungry after one entree. The rice bowls are doll-sized. The eggplant basil is about 50% eggplant and 50% mixed vegetables.   It gets really drafty during the winter if you sit in the booths across from the bar. But somehow there's a vent that's blowing hot air on one part of your face. Makes for an interesting temperature experience.  i think I'll give them another shot and re-assess afterward."}
{"text":"Just awful. We had a rather large party of 15 people for a couple of friends Birthdays. Even though reservations were made well in advance they only had two waitresses. It was a Saturday night and one of them was actually doubling as bartender. It took nearly an hour to start getting any food after it was ordered and everything came out out of order. An appetizer would come out then 10 minutes later a main course would come out. Nothing came out at the same time and some of us were completely done eating before others even got their food. Completely unacceptable. The food was mediocre at best. The chicken in all of the dishes was way overcooked, dry and chewy. The peanut sauce was good though. An 18% gratuity was automatically added to everyone's bill. I had mixed feelings about that. Our waitress certainly deserved it but it was a poor management decision to only have 2 waitresses on staff. A few days later one of my friends received $170 in charges on her card that she is currently disputing. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for lunch since I work up the road. They're quick, friendly and reasonably priced - which makes for a perfect workday lunch in my opinion.   They recently added some new items to their menu including their version of Pho. Different than most versions I've had but it was absolutely fantastic. Nice spicy broth, thick rice noodles and large chunks of chicken. No jalapeños but it was plenty spicy and had a large portion size.  They also have one of the better Thai iced teas that I've tried in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The reviews matched my experience. The pad Thai was ok. Nothing special. Can't say I would go back but I also would scare someone away. Don't have a lot to say other than it was just ok.  Maybe I'll give it a chance and try something else."}
{"text":"Recommended by my boyfriend.. we often drive past.  It's not a very big restaurant but cozy and clean.   The menu has a lot to offer - all of your thai favorite dishes can be found.  I enjoyed the corn fritters for an appetizer.  I got the chicken pad thai as my main dish. It wasn't spicy enough.. I ordered it as a 6 just to play it safe (1-10 spicy) but wished I went higher because I could have probably handled a 9.   The service was excellent.  The dish was good but definitely not my favorite.   Thank you"}
{"text":"This is my first Thai food restaurant I have eaten at in Pittsburgh and I love it! The Tom kha soup with vegetables is delicious and so is the butternut squash curry. The mango sticky rice is the best dessert!!"}
{"text":"I just moved back to Pittsburgh and decided to take my boyfriend to the Thai Place for a celebratory dinner.  The good news was that on a Wednesday evening around 7:30, it was nearly empty and our food came out very promptly; we weren't even finished with our spring rolls when the entrees came out.  The bad news is that prices have gone up, portion sizes have gone down, and the food was pretty bland.  My boyfriend rated his pad thai lower than some \"fast-food\" Asian places', and my curry with a spice level of 7 was so tame, it wouldn't have bothered an infant.  I'm not sure if this place was better 6 years ago, or if I just had lower standards because I hadn't tried Thai food anywhere else and I was a high school student without years of trying restaurants under my belt.  At any rate, I will be on the lookout for a better Thai restaurant and would only go here if desperate."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Nothing more to say about this place - some of the best Thai food I've had in the US."}
{"text":"Overpriced; poor ingredients; americanized thai food.  Food was worthy of two stars, but the owner/attendant's Seinfeld-esque rudeness lowers their rating to one star.  Not worth visiting despite its monopoly on Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"Ok seriously, was just on hold 2 separate times for 10 minutes, not acceptable. It still may be dinner rush, however, you get customers over the phone too. I'm very disappointed in this local fox chapel business. I've never experienced anything like this before.  12/26/14 never will support this local business."}
{"text":"Came here because my brother wanted some Thai food and we were visiting Pittsburgh. I won't say this ruined anything, but I guess I was expecting more.  The food itself wasn't bad, and the service wasn't bad either. I was just underwhelmed. I started with the Tom Yum, and that was somewhat of a disappointment, as it was literally half full of raw mushrooms. I like mushrooms, but I'm pretty sure at that point it became a mushroom dish that was sitting in a broth instead of a soup.   Also managed to try the Larb Gai (chicken salad), Panang curry, and Pad See Ew. The salad was pretty basic--it looked as though I could make it at home. Simple romaine mix you see at stores with processed chicken that looked like vomit. Tasted OK though, which was a relief. The curry was given in an odd plate, which meant the quantity was very thin. The noodles were also made with egg noodle instead of the flat rice noodles, which was quite disappointing. I've never been disappointed by Pad See Ew, except that time.  Overall, food was OK and edible, but I've had better Thai food (aka this might be on the bottom list of Thai places I've been to)."}
{"text":"This place advertised itself as a top 10 Thai restaurant in America. LOL. I doubt it would even be top 10 in Pittsburgh. The food was extremely bland, the prices were too high, the spiciness was sorely lacking, and the portions were too small. Will not be going back and will continue my search for good Thai food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Yikes this place is sooo overpriced!  Got takeout and spent over 60 for three dishes; didn't realize 6 shrimp cost an extra 3!  Quality is just OK, and nothing to get excited about with regards to  price, esp since they skimp on the meat.  Plus they have water chestnuts in everything (boo). Should've listened to the reviews and took the extra time to pick up from nearby Noodlehead, Spice Island, or Nicky's. It's too bad considering they are in the heart of Shadyside and could be really great if they would just adjust their price to reflect quality.  First and last time I will go here!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Portions are small, but mediocre pricing at lunch hour.  This restaurant definitely caters to the elders in Shadyside as opposed to the college crowd of CMU, Pitt and Chatham."}
{"text":"One visit for supper (five other customers on a Thursday night) = chicken with basil and \"vegetables\". Mass quantities of grease with grease flavored grease accompanied by old chicken and lots of bean sprouts, three carrot slices, and five basil leaves. Spice level eight was nearly undetectab"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but is rather overpriced for what you get.  The wines are similarly too high.  The service is friendly and the ambience pretty nice, but the food is slightly below average and the price point is much higher than it should be given the quality of food."}
{"text":"The waitstaff is super friendly, comfortable booths, and cheesy mirrored interior decorating. Sadly the Thai food is so/so, but the sushi... you have to try the firecracker roll. Once had three orders in one sitting with three friends! Amazing firecracker roll! Who knew."}
{"text":"Average chinese food... Yeah I said Chinese...there wasnt much flavor. The Tom kah soup wasn't bad. I would not go back."}
{"text":"(In English) I've tried the Mongolian Beef and the Chicken with Basil. These two dishes are just so-so: they taste like the dishes in a Chinese restaurant for non-Chinese customers; the sizes of the dishes are small, without much protein; the taste of the beef is OK. I may not come back to here anymore. It's a little expensive - the food does not deserve the price. The Thai food at CMU's truck is only 5-6 bucks!   (In Chinese) ???????????????????????????????????cmu truck???"}
{"text":"I used to eat here a bunch when I lived on Walnut, but since moving to Squirrel Hill I have never had the urge to go back. I mean, it is alright Thai food, but it is pretty expensive - and the squirrel hill choices (Silk Elephant, Bangkok Balcony) are just better."}
{"text":"One of the oddities in Canada is 2 & 3-star hotels will have good restaurants attached.  So if you drive by an Easy 8 Motel and see they are also offering all you can eat Sushi, don't assume its not a good place to try.  But skip it if its next to a veterinarian hospital.    Another thing for Americans to deal with in Canada is everything is just a little bit different.  From \"Aboot\" to parliamentary politics, ethnocentrism can negatively shade your experience.  I had to battle my USA bias with this Thai place.  I had chicken satay, red pork curry and pad thai.  And it was all a little weird.  The peanut sauce I think was made with some kind of jelly.  The curry was a soup that must of been 50% coconut milk and 50% Wesson oil.  The pad thai had a strange tang with mushy tofu.  My indigenous lunch mate said this place was great and everything tasted normal.  Hmmm...  I've had Thai in several countries.  And if this represents Canadian Thai, I'll go for the all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice and the staff was pretty friendly, but the food was just standard Thai food. Nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Over priced, bad food and worse service, in fact the food was indistinguishable from bad Chinese food."}
{"text":"Meh.  The food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  I'll agree that the curry puffs were pretty good, but they were more Indian than Thai.  We started with some spring rolls, which were fine, but not being a spring roll person, I let my friend eat most of them.    We then got the curry puffs, fried tofu, and the panang curry.  I was not particularly fond of their fried tofu - it was perfectly crispy, but somehow totally bland, even with the sauce that was provided.  The panang curry was fine too, but again, nothing spectacular.  Totally reasonable place.  The service is nice, but the prices seem kind of high for what it is.  I don't think I would go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for dinner here when I walked in; it's such a nice looking place with lots of extra seating in the back, and was fairly quiet on a Wednesday evening, meaning I could comfortably talk to my friends without having to shout. Always a plus!  But things overall went downhill quickly once I sat down and my group began ordering. The service was pretty bad, especially considering that our group was one of three or four tables total that even had people sitting at them. Examples of what I mean by \"Pretty bad\": no one ever checked on our water and only refilled our drinks if we waved them down and specifically asked for them to do so (and even grabbing a waitress to ASK for the refill was tough, because, again, they never came by the table to check on us), and a couple of us actually had to ask for green tea repeatedly from TWO waitresses before one of them brought that out. The tea itself tasted really weak and did not impress me.  As for the food: a friend reported that their food was not as spicy as he thought it would be, and he asked for it at level 10. So I guess \"spicy\" means \"mild\" at this place. I personally ordered the Mongolian beef, which I thought was fairly good (the pineapple in it was a nice touch); while it wasn't an outstanding dish it was still very enjoyable. But while my main course tasted lovely the spring roll I ordered, or rather, the sauce that came with it, was horrendous. I forget what kind of sauce it was but it tasted nasty and made the roll unbearable. I used my main dish's sauce for dipping instead.  I didn't even bother with dessert; in Shadyside, there's plenty of other options, and I'd had enough disappointment for one meal. Really, that's the best word to describe this place: not terrible but disappointing overall. And from what I could see during my meal here, Thai Place Restaurant is about unique and flavorful as its name."}
{"text":"One star for the worst service in Pittsburgh. The food is decent, but you have to wait a long time for the incompetent staff to get you anything, from food to drinks."}
{"text":"I am not really a Thai food eater but we were with a group of people and this is where they wanted to go.  We were seated right away and our server was right there.  Food was a bit slow coming from the kitchen but it seemed to be worth the wait.  Hubby said that his Won Ton soup was the best ever.  Curry puffs, crispy duck, pad Thai noodles all were great.  Yes, the white rice was a little old tasting but overall it was a solid 3.5/4 stars"}
{"text":"When I lived in the area, I used to come here a lot both to eat in and take out. The quality has gone down a bit over the last year - the last few times we went, the service wasn't great, the portions are getting smaller, plus they are giving too many vegetables and not enough meat. However, they do make a great Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Couldn't eat here because no one whom I asked could figure out if their tofu was organic and GMO free. I called 2 locations and either location they didn't know what they're serving.   Restaurants should know what they're serving ESPECIALLY when there is a public uproar surrounding a particular ingredient / process."}
{"text":"About the same as the others said. It's edible, its alright, its by far not the best Thai food I've had. If you're on Walnut street and undecided and on foot, try something else. If you're in a car and set on Thai, there's another better place in town."}
{"text":"I love trying new Thai places. The server was pleasant but the food was not impressive or exciting. It was pretty expensive for food that I could've prepared or even store bought. Got the sweet and sour tofu. No exciting flavor. Just bland. Corn fritters were good but that's about all.  $43 for an appetizer and two plates. I'll pass."}
{"text":"I have only been here once because I quickly found many other Thai restaurants in the East End with better service and much better (and better priced) food. My husband and I stopped by one Sunday after a little shopping when we were relatively new to Pittsburgh. It took a while for us to be seated, and there were maybe three or four tables filled with people in the entire restaurant.  Because it was our first time at this restaurant, and because we hadn't asked for advice from friends before coming, we went with the basics: pad kee mao with chicken. I hesitate to order my favorite Thai dish, red curry, anywhere before reading reviews about it first. I absolutely hate eating mediocre red curry. It just shouldn't happen. Anyway, the pad kee mao was fine. It was on the lukewarm side, and I tasted more grease than spice. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either. I took half of it home and never got around to eating the leftovers.  Because there are so many delicious Thai restaurants in the East End, I don't know how Thai Place is still open and doing decent business. The only reason it is still open has to be that it's located right smack in the middle of all the Walnut Street retail madness. They probably cater to a lot of shoppers who need a quick bite to eat while shopping.  Again, this place isn't terrible, it's just not the best."}
{"text":"Service was good, nice and friendly. Iced coffee was delicious and good price. I got pad see ew but the sauce was not anywhere as good as most places I go to. Good portion though, large amount."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place! The Pad Thai is amazing, the soups are all very good. The wait staff are very friendly and pleasant. Food is out quick and delicious. I love going here."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for 5 years and today was the last time. I ordered one of their duck dishes and it came with 4 FOUR little pieces of duck coated with something -- very small pieces, $18.00. I complained and was told essentially tough luck. I commented that it will the last time I come and the manager smiled.  Stay away. There is a LOT better even in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"OMG, am I so ready to go back to San Francisco that I just can't wait any longer for Asian food.  And now I've found the 6th thing that is more expensive in Pittsburgh than San Francisco.  The Thai food here in Shadyside.  Sure, it's decent tasting, nothing out of this world.  Portions are rather small by Pittsburgh standards.  But curry for $12.95?  I mean you can get the same dish for almost half the price in SF.  I know it's Walnut Street, but why are the prices so high?  Next time, I'll hold out a little longer."}
{"text":"Always super friendly. Food is fresh and delicious. We had chicken satay,  chicken fried rice and Pad Se Ew. Delicious. That was my first time having Pad Se Ew and I loved it. Had a similar dish out of town so I was trying to find their very. I successfully found it. The place is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner or lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few times when I was visiting my friend who lives out this way. Most recently, we both ordered the lunch special with pad thai - one with chicken and one with tofu. The lunch deal came with a small portion of soup and a small veggie egg roll as well, which was awesome! I tried their wonton soup, which was super tasty and my friend loved her hot & sour soup. The egg roll was quite tasty as well! The pad thai was also really tasty and we were both given generous portions. I should also mention that pick up was a breeze- the staff was very friendly and it came out right on time AND they are open on Mondays, which is unlikely for a thai place, but also super convenient! Overall, I really enjoy this place & will most likely return again the next time I am out this way!"}
{"text":"Came here for a light dinner. Great Pad Thai noodles!  Just the right amount of spice.  Chicken satay and spring rolls were good too.  Service was terrific.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is ok...it's actually the only thing that was worth having (in my limited experience). I couldn't believe how much salt they had put in my red curry. Calamari fries...Any restaurant would do better fries. The batter kept on coming off the calamari. Would not return."}
{"text":"I love everything I ever get here.  When I worked in the area I'd go here for lunch 3-5 times a month.  The lunch special is a decent sized portion with a tiny spring roll and your choice of Wonton or Hot & Sour soup.  All for around $6-8.  Sometimes the egg roll or soup is cold, but the food is so good that it won't change my 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner this weekend. No wait for a table, group of 6. Atmosphere is casual and soft.  Service at Thai Place is mehh at best. We had a relatively long wait for food despite being the only group. Then, they neglected to put in one of our orders for fried calimari. It also took a couple times asking before we got ice for the water.   The food was good though nothing especial. I had the panang chicken, which came out pretty well. Others in my group had the fried rice, which was eagerly devoured, as well as the fried calimari. However, many of the calimari pieces were batter only, no calimari inside! How on earth does that happen?! Lastly though, the tom yum soup drew rave reviews.   Although the atmosphere was nice and the staff courteous, the long wait time combined with just 'ok' food makes me believe that there are easily better options for thai/asian food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Bumping up my stars because I have recently found out that they use a soy sauce in their sauces that is gluten free! Feast away, my fellow gluten intolerants and celiacs!"}
{"text":"I live in Fox Chapel, but was in Shadyside to meet up with friends. The Fox Chapel location is leaps and bounds over this one. Our soups, appetizers and entree all came out at the same time. By the time we ate our soup, everything else was cold. The service was fine, but the flavor of the dishes wasn't up to the standard of the Fox Chapel location. I know it is the same owner, but this location is lacking!  I hope it improves. If not, go to the one in Fox Chapel!"}
{"text":"Thai Place... there is nothing wrong with this place.  I order it from a local delivery service when I have no desire to leave my place in the Southside and nothing else that I love delivers there.    Pad thai, good.  Corn fritters, good.  Spring rolls, good.  We cannot complain about the food but when we compare it to that of Nicky's or the Smiling Banana Leaf it does not compare (although I love that they have the corn fritters all of the time and not just as a special item).    If you want great Thai, look elsewhere... but if you want a basic good Thai meal, Thai Place can indeed meet your needs."}
{"text":"Unremarkable Thai food. It's not bad, it's nothing to phone home about either. Prices are decent, the location is convenient, and the service is friendly.  If you're looking for really good Thai food, though, try Nicky's, Smiling Banana Leaf, or either of the Thai spots in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"I love it here and I try and introduce it to as many people as possible.  They have great lunch specials (meal, egg roll and soup) and they aren't typically crowded so you can get in and out pretty quickly.  Both my  parents aren't big fans of Chinese food and I think most people associate Thai food with Chinese.  Not the case.  There are some similarities but I love the flavors and sauces used in Thai and the vegetables always seem so much more fresh.  Needless to say, my parents love it here now.  I always order the spicy chicken and opt for spicing of #5 (scale of 1 to 10).  I've gone up on the scale to #7 and my eyes and nose were watering.  I love how flavorful the food is and you get an ample food for the price.  I've ordered the spring rolls or the corn fritters as an appetizer and they are very tasty and the sauce that accompanies them is perfect although it is a sweet sauce.  The Pad Thai also gets goods reviews from friends I've taken.    The place is clean and the service is attentive.  Stop by and give it a try if you're in the Shadyside area.  And on the bonus side, it's right across the street from Mercurio's so you can swing by for some gelatto afterwards."}
{"text":"We ducked into Thai place while hungrily walking the streets of Shadyside...unfortunately we left the place nearly as hungry as before, only to go home and make our own yummy curry.  We were there pre-dinner rush, thus it was not busy, yet we waited an abnormally long time to order. Good trick, because in the meantime we decided to need an appetizer. Once our server acknowledged us, he seemed rushed and hastily answered our questions; yes, the annoying vegan oriented questions.   Our spring rolls were airy and flavorless :(.  The main dish, a mango veggie curry was so-so. We ordered it with tofu, but did not get any. The sauce was watery, though did have a nice flavor. The mangoes--ripe and delicious. The portion was tiny! And at $15, I find that to be inexcusable. There was not even enough rice to fill up on. Granted, we were two people sharing one dish, but we usually have no problems, due to the American sized portions we have come to expect. Bottom line is that the value did not match the price. For $7, this would be a three star review.  Our server resolved to be friendly around check time. We were accidentally charged for another table's bill, but we noticed and the problem was fixed, as far as we know."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Thai Place, at all.  I ordered take out of fresh tofu spring rolls, tofu pad thai, and red curry with tofu. I love fresh spring rolls, but these were pathetic. The tiniest rolls ever, and the rice paper was hard instead of soft and gummy (probably a sign that these fresh rolls were in fact...not fresh at all). I bit into it, and got...a mouthful of chicken?! If I hadn't gotten takeout I would have sent them back. I'm not a vegetarian, but if I was I would've been pretty pissed. I mean, I was still pissed, but whatever.  Anyway, aside from the nasty spring rolls, the pad thai was pretty good, but the red curry was just okay. I didn't feel it had much heat to it, and I ordered it 8/10 spiciness. It's not like it was terrible but...come on...how hard is it to make red curry taste decent? I don't know, I guess it's not that bad. There is just much better, even in Pittsburgh. I'd much rather go to Thai Cuisine or Bangkok Balcony."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a while. It's been okay, but it really doesn't deserve any higher than this.  I usually order the pad thai and it's a fine dish. It's slightly overpriced but it's fine if you just come once in a while.  The food is usually nice, but today I ordered the dish \"bird nest\" and it was a major disappointment. The menu said \"shrimps, chicken, and scallops\". In reality there was ONE scallop and THREE shrimps total in the entire dish. There was an overload of chicken and almost no shrimps and scallops as described. I'm not being picky, but this is literally false advertisement. Scallops shouldn't have been plural.   Service is usually okay, but I remember walking into the place at a bit past 9 and the waiters refused to serve me. They said the kitchen closes at 9:30. I said but it's not 9:30 and they said they close early that day. So I just walked out.  Today I walked in at around 12 and they only gave me the regular menu. So I asked for the lunch menu (it's cheaper and i wasn't super hungry anyway). And they just rudely told me that the lunch menu wasn't available today. Okay, whatever, but when I was waiting I noticed that all the tables close to mine was getting soup. I'm really not sure if everybody just decided to order soup or if the waiters game them the lunch menu but not me.  So I'm pretty disappointed. If we grade purely on the taste of the food, this place could get a 4, despite being a little overpriced. But at time the attitude really sucks.  Oh by the way, if you've been there more than twice, they'll start greeting you with \"Nice to see you again\" or \"We were talking about you. We wondered why you didn't come back for such a while\". As far as I've been there, they tell me this every time and I've heard them saying this to other customers a lot too. Alright I know I sound bitchy for complaining about this, but after a while it sounds really sarcastic."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is such a great description for the food here. I got several items as take-out, some more traditionally Thai and some not. Nothing was terrible but nothing was particularly good either. I'd likely return given the convenient location for me, but the prices are too high to justify returning for \"meh\" food.   Otherwise, the staff was friendly. And, the decor is seriously outdated and dark."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from out of town. After walking around, this looked like one of the better restaurants in Shadyside. The food was good, not exceptional but not bad. I had the pad thai and my friend had fried rice. Both were delicious. I liked that the pad thai had a good amount of chicken. Sometimes when you order chicken pad thai you only get like three pieces of chicken at other restaurants, but not here! You get a pretty large serving. The staff was very friendly and checked on us frequently, granted it was not super busy when we were there for dinner. They let us sit and chat after the meal and did not rush us. The ambiance was nice and quiet. The tables were fancy and it was very clean with Thai decorations. I would go back if I was in Shadyside looking for some decent Asian food. That being said, it is no where near the standards of Thai food I can get in California."}
{"text":"Dude what happened to this place? It's like it fell off a cliff within the past year or so. The services and management still seems to be friendly enough, but the quality of the food has declined precipitously. Order a curry and you'll get something akin to watery chinese food. The funniest part is that they have a sign out on the sidewalk saying that they were ranked as one of the best places for Thai food in the country. That's gotta be some sort of joke."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend.  The appetizer dumplings are really (really!) good!  I also had the sweet and sour tofu, also very good.  Tom kha soup, which is my go-to favorite that I test out every new thai restaurant with ... also two thumbs up!  The waitstaff are super nice and friendly too!  Unfortunately I live nowhere close to Shadyside anymore, so I won't be coming often, but I would definitely reccommend this place to anyone living nearby."}
{"text":"This place is open on Monday on a regular basis... Yelp has it wrong. Lunches are priced in around $9 and the food is excellent. Probably the best hot and sour soup I've ever had and the Gang dong red curry that I ordered with tofu was very delicious the portions are adequate so that you feel satisfied and not overly stuffed which is perfect for lunch since I need to get back to work. I would recommend this place absolutely and will stop back again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at Thai Place! The atmposhere, decor and service is average but the food is amazing. For someone who generally does not eat many vegetarian dishes, the General Tso's Tofu is one of the best, most addictive dishes I have ever had at a thai restaurant. Sweet and sour chicken and pad thai are also favorites."}
{"text":"Ate spring rolls with chicken, the wonton soup, and the pad Thai chicken at a 7.  The spring rolls were fresh although I recommend the no chicken option. The wonton soup was great with a tasty broth. Definitely recommend.   The pad Thai chicken smelled funny and wasn't good nor was it a 7 hotness. Not spicy at all, in fact. I won't be back because the pad Thai chicken was not good.   Service very nice but very slow. Not many people were in the restaurant at the time and it was snowy outside."}
{"text":"I simply ordered fried rice to go and the restaurant was practically empty but they made me wait 30 minutes. The food is good but the service could be much better. My advice: order far ahead and save your time"}
{"text":"Got some good memories at this place :) good place,good food and nice people.     But i really wonder why they did not get more creative for naming the place and just called it the thai place.    This review of mine is going to end now. Short and sweet :) hmmm..sweet...hmm..Panang curry sounds good ,and so does that tofu with peanut butter sauce or the pad thai...ok!! i am stopping :)  -Smriti :)"}
{"text":"This place is always kinda empty, which always freaks me out, but the food is great. Service is friendly enough, they are quiet but very attentive. I hate how the bathroom is one of those \"Oh crap, I guess we need a bathroom in this place, huh? kind of bathrooms, but what can ya do? The decor is all pretty 80s/90s...this is definitely more of a takeout kind of place."}
{"text":"The Shadyside Thai Place is perfect for a weeknight meal out with friends. The place is almost always empty, so service is very prompt. The servers are always very friendly, too. The curries and fried rice are delicious! My only complaint is that the prices are on the high side -- but the portions are big enough that it's almost always two meals anyway."}
{"text":"I whish I could rate this place no stars..... $45 for 2 dishes and satay - carry out! You got to be kidding me!   Small portions and the food was below average at best.  Long story short - I know thai.... and this aint it! I think the location and the lack of anything like it in around keeps this place open (cause I know the food cant be doing the trick for them.)  Moved here from chicago and this falls way short of the worst thai place back home."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  It has a standard menu and nothing's bad, but quite frankly, it's nothing to write home about either.  In plenty of cities, this restaurant would get rave reviews, but Thai food in Pittsburgh is just too good to go out of your way to eat here.  If you're in the neighborhood and hungry for Thai, it's a perfectly serviceable choice.  But it's not worth a detour."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I always get their pad see ew dish because it's really superb, but pretty much everything i've had here is tasty.  My friends always went to Bangkok Balcony in Squirrel Hill over this place probably because I went to CMU and this place is slightly more difficult to get to.  Also, I'm a big fan of booth seating, which is lacking at the other place."}
{"text":"It was so good!! It was Noon on Sunday when the first opened. The staff was great and nice. The food was the best.   I will have to go back. iPhone owners should check in with Gowalla."}
{"text":"This was my first pho experience and I wasn't sure what to expect. The staff (family owned) was super nice and accommodating. I loved what I ordered - although I could have went spicier probably for my tastes. The bowl was so huge that I had leftovers to take home! Recommended for sure. I will be back."}
{"text":"All around good restaurant.  If you are in the area and looking for Thai, this is a good choice.  If you are coming from outside the general area, I'm not sure I would make the trip (I also do not know what the rest of the Thai joints are like in the Burgh... so maybe this is 5 star worthy?). Here is my 2 cents: For the app we rocked the dumplings.  They were fine.  Pricey for 4 and nothing special... but decent enough. I did rock the Wonton soup which was decent.  It had a few nice touches to it including a couple pieces of chicken and a shrimp.  Another welcome addition has some cilantro.  Added something nice to it. The entrees were good all around.  The sizzling beef was tasty (yet lacked the sizzle).  I ordered it 8 out of 10 on the spicy scale and to me it was a 2.  Maybe better off I don't have to sit in a bowl of ice tomorrow morning... but sometimes the pleasure is worth the pain. My friend had the spicy chicken.  Nice flavor to it.  Nothing out of the ordinary but was a very good dish. Overall, I feel the sign outside saying it is rated one of the 10 best in the country was WAY misleading.  Hell... I'm not sure it would make my top 10 even.  I did want to  go outside and hide a letter to say \"county\" which would be more truth in advertising! Overall... give it a shot if you are local and want some Thai."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat at before you go to a play at the Benedum. It's ideal for a small group as the place is small and very busy before plays. If you can, I reccomend making reservations beforehand."}
{"text":"They have signs outside claiming to be one of the top-10 Thai restaurants in the nation.  With that kind of ego trip, I had to give them a try.  Well, they have a point.  Their curry chicken puffs have to be the best I've ever had.  Subtle curry sauce combines with chicken and a yummy pastery to create a true five-star experience.  So far, I haven't found a main dish that's satisfied me as much as the appetizer.  Portions are a little small, like P F Chang's (see review).  I'm actually thinking that next time I go I might have a couple of orders of curry puffs and leave it at that.  It's not that they don't try - the quality of ingredients is very high - but I prefer the tastes associated with Chinese food.  Except those curry puffs.  Yum.  Service is outstanding - friendly and attentive, and my waiter was very helpful in trying to guide me to my next stop for the day.  (If you've lived in this area, you know that this is not easy; Pittsburgh is one of the world's most confusing cities.)  Note that this is a chain and there is another one on Craig Street near CMU."}
{"text":"Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Tai with shrimp anywhere in Pittsburgh. The wonton soup is light and not too salty with the lightest wonton wrappers that melt in your mouth. Delicious! The steamed dumplings are also a favorite!"}
{"text":"Good Lord, this food was awful. Yes, people cook with sugar in Thailand. But this entire meal was so incredibly sweet, it gave me a sugar headache. Many Thai herbs and spices are also absent, making this meal flavorless except for heat and sugar.  Then, what should've been sweet, a mango dessert, was made with old, flavorless mangoes. If you love Thai food, search for a more authentic place."}
{"text":"Went here with another friend. Atmosphere was nice overall, not that many people (maybe it was weekday evening). The waiters were very nice and respectful.  She ordered Pad Thai (spicy level 2) and I ordered the Gang Dang (spicy level 4). If you enjoy spicy thai food, make sure to order spicy level 7 or above because it's not that spicy! The pad thai was quite good, but was too sweet (because not that spicy). My chicken red curry was more soupy. I liked the vegetables and the meat was well-cooked. Taste, ok. The meals were of smaller portion size. I thought it was nothing special, though. Just good thai food.  Overall, if you really crave thai food, happened to be around and don't want to travel elsewhere, go here! But I would suggest Smiling Banana Leaf for the price/portion/taste."}
{"text":"They have some really neat dishes on the menu. Fried potato bowl is really good. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We always get take out from here when we're craving Thai.  I usually opt for the Pad Thai, which is delightful.  The spring rolls are just okay.   If you randomly crave Thai, like this girl does, this will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"If you want traditional Thai food-choose somewhere else. I was disappointed they did not serve traditional Thai food but more the combination of Chinese with Thai - American Version. They didn't even carry Jasmine Rice."}
{"text":"We recently had lunch at Thai place and were very disappointed. They've cut back on quality and quantity and unfortunately it was very dirty. My husband got food poisoning. The entire menu and restaurant needs redone. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Thai Place for lunch on several different occasions. The food is very good, and the lunch menu is a bargain. For less tan $10, you get soup, spring rolls, and a generous lunch portion. The only thing to keep in mind is that (like most of the other reviewers have noted) the food is not very spicy."}
{"text":"Their General Tso's Tofu is slammin.  And they have a \"raw spring roll,\" which is rice paper around... tofu and greens and something else?  It's a unique flavor with the sweet, peanut sauce.  Totally awesome, and totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"I've been going here every once in awhile for years. I am not a big fan of incredibly spicy food, so I'm sure I'm missing out on something that others really enjoy about Thai food, but I still really love this place. I usually go here when I feel like splurging on myself because it's not very cheap. Actually, at lunch they have nice lunch specials, I believe.  I've had various dishes here. Usually I get the Pad Thai with chicken. I think it is absolutely delicious and the best pad thai I've ever had. Last night, I tried the Emerald Chicken for the first time. The spinach was perfectly cooked--not too wilted, not undercooked--and the chicken was tender and not dried out. The peanut sauce that came with the dish was plentiful and absolutely delicious. It was very sweet and thick. It was likely so sweet because I told the waitress I only wanted a 1 on the spice level. I actually think the dish would have been better with a little bit of spice, so I think most people would enjoy the dish even more than I did if they aren't a spice wuss like me.  I have also tried their version of General Tso's chicken. That was my probably my least favorite thing of all the things I have tried there. One of my favorite things (when in season) is the mango slices with coconut sticky rice. If you have not tried this traditional thai dessert, I highly suggest you give it a try. It very well may be my favorite dessert of all time. Soup here is tasty, spring rolls fresh and crispy. No complaints about any of the food here.  Lastly, I am glad that the Thai Place has a liquor license. I have never tried any of their cocktails, but I always order a glass of wine. I am happy they have variety in their wine choices, even if not a ton of variety.  The service is always incredibly friendly here, though there always seems to be far too many staff on duty than is necessary. Oh well! Better safe than sorry, I suppose!"}
{"text":"There is (used to be? It's been a few years since I lived in the PGH) a sign out front of this place saying it has the best Thai food in America. They ain't lyin. Eight bucks for some delicious pad thai, AMAZING spring rolls, and the best hot and sour soup I've ever had in my life! Seriously, I've spent the last 5 years trying to find a soup that compares. It'll never happen. That, and the service is fantastic. Really sweet, not overbearing, and not lazy - spending eight bucks on lunch leaves you with enough to give them a very nice tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just ok, but you can do better for Thai in Pittsburgh.  Fairly large selection of menu items, but prices are about 20% above what they should be and portions are a bit small.  Food is generally ok, but by no means memorable.  Building is clean and staff is friendly, but I would suggest going to Nicky's, the Smiling Banana, or the Thai Restaurant in Bloomfield over this place."}
{"text":"I am in Pittsburgh for family and work, so I headed over to Shadyside for some dinner.  Walnut St was a mess, construction all over the place.  It is a good thing that it did not deter me from stopping in Thai Place.  Atmosphere - Inside was nice.  Just like the photos above.    Service - Good, but the waitress was a little confused when I asked what kind of white rice they had with their dishes.  Other than that, service was prompt, polite and frequent.  Food - Pretty good.  The Thai Spicy Beef salad (Yum Neue) was the 2ND best that I have had in the US.  My main dish, spicy chicken cashew, which I told them to make super hot was just warm.  Oh well, I am sure I appreciated it in the morning...ha.  Sticky Rice & Mango was perfect.  After my disappointment at Exotic Thai in Simi Valley, CA this presentation reminded me why I love this desert sooo much.  Thank you Thai Place.  Likes - * Spicy Beef Salad...bring on the spicy * Sticky Rice & Mango - done right * Service - quick  Dislikes - * Do I look like a wimp, when I say spicy, give me spicey...haha. * Walnut St construction.  Overall, Pittsburgh has a great place for Thai food and based on their wall photos with the owner, Bono thinks so too."}
{"text":"i really liked this place. it was slightly more expensive than i thought it would be... the food was delicious, but for the amount, it was a little pricey. i ordered the iced thai coffee which was delicious... didn't really taste very thai-style, more like a mocha, but still very addicting. we also got siamese samosas, which are basically crab rangoon but better, i was quite pleased. i finally also ordered the mussaman curry bowl which was served with rice. the curry was delicious, although not nearly as spicy as i would have liked, and was expecting it to be. i also would have liked more rice on the side, but it was still delicious, so i really can't complain. my friend that i was with got the coffee as well and another curry bowl and our bill was about $45."}
{"text":"horrible experience in here.....  we've been waiting 30 mins for our food and then informed that they were running out of sth that we need to change a new dish. and  this is not the worst..there's sth like a steel ball piece in my friends dish. They just took it away and then brought it back without even saying sorry.....also the lady treated us so rudely...anyway..nothing was right in here"}
{"text":"We have been to their other locations and Shadyside proves that they know what they are doing.  We were made to feel welcomed from the moment we walked in greeted by our server with a large caring smile. I ordered A beer imported from Thailand  (Singha) a smooth great full bodied beer. We got the dumplings and Calamari for our appetizers they came out very quickly and were delicious. Then I got the best soup my favorite (Tom Kah) the flavor is to die for basically a coconut soup spicy of course.Then I got the bird nest its a fried potato they artistically turn into what  looks like nest inside the nest is chicken shrimp and veggies piled high unique and yummy.I had every on having desert but was to full."}
{"text":"We were in the area and found this Thai restaurant near the Waterworks.  It was a Friday night around 830pm.  It wasn't busy at all.  We walked in and were greeted by the hostess which turned out to be our waiter.  He said we could choose any table that we liked and we did.  We both ordered water and looked over the menu.  We have been in a wide noodle type of mood so that's what we looked for.  I got the Pad Se Ew and my wife got the Spicy Rice Noodles.  We also ordered their Fresh Spring Rolls for an appetizer.       The restaurant is nothing fancy just average decorations and furniture.  Our waiter was nice.  The menu wasn't too big either but it had what we were looking for.  It says they have a full bar and they do have a couple shelves of liquor but again nothing to fancy. Our Rolls came within 5 minutes and I liked them.  My wife thought they needed to have more mint and green things in the rolls (LOL) but it's actually just how I like it.  Their peanut sauce was a little sweet and we heard another customer complain about it.  The hot Thai sauce that we asked for was really good and went well with our rolls.         Our food came out and there was a lot of food on the plate.  I asked for chicken and it was good.  The flavor was tasty and I asked for a spice level of 7 and I thought it was spicy.  My wife and I usually agree on spice levels and she didn't think it was spicy.  My dish had a lot of vegetables in it which was good but they put water chestnuts in there and I'm not a big fan of that.  There were a lot too which made me not enjoy my food as much.  Also the noodles were skinny and not as good as some other Thai places we have been too.  I think it was average not bad but not great.  For the price of the food and the amount that we got I was still happy."}
{"text":"The soup and roll were really good. I ordered spicy thai fired rice on lunch, with level 5 spice, and it wasn't that good. Most of my colleagues ordered curry fried rice and pineapple fired rice, so I think those must be the popular dishes.  The place is definitely a good option for the price."}
{"text":"I've been going to Thai Place off and on for several years. Started off well and went regularly. Over the last two years, both the food and service has been terrible. Several months ago, my chicken must've sat in the deep fryer for an hour because it was like eating a dog bone. First of all, it should have never bee brought out that way, but there was no compensation for the extra time I had to wait for it to be remade. Today was the last straw. We waited an hour after we ordered to get our food. No one offered an explanation and when flagged down, was basically ignored. They did not offer to even discount our meal. I won't ever go back. Spend the extra dollar or two and go to Tai Pei, Ichiban, or Jimmy Wan's if your in the O'Hara area."}
{"text":"Their curries are tasty, but it is extremely overpriced in my opinion.  It's hard to justify picking this place when better and much less expensive options abound quite nearby (Thai Restaurant in Bloomfield, Smiling Banana Leaf, and Noodlehead).  I wish it were a lot less pricey, especially for lunch.  All their lunch menu prices are still in the $14-15 range (if I recall correctly), and why don't they have better lunch specials?  if I'm going to spend more on Thai food, I'm going to drive to Nicky's and enjoy the artful presentation and gorgeous garden, which are things the Thai Place can't claim.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"On my first visit to Pittsburgh, I asked a lot of people for food recommendations. Thai Place came up a few times, so when we were walking around on Walnut St one weekend, we went here for lunch.  The portions are smaller than I expected, and the prices higher, especially for lunch. But that being said, the food was absolutely excellent.  We shared the tod mun (fishcakes) for appetizer, which were among the best I've ever had. Very good flavor, and not chewy.  I got tofu pad thai (8/10 spiciness), and he got mango chicken curry (1/10 spiciness), and they were both very much to our liking. I usually order an 8 on my first visit, and this was a respectable 8 with spice definitely present but not overwhelming or burning. Next time I would go up to a 9 or 10, though, because I I do like a bit more of a sinus-clearing kick.  Service was good and bathrooms were clean. I'd definitely come back, but maybe for dinner--I don't really like spending $20+ on lunch."}
{"text":"Their signature dish is excellent!  I am always treated in a friendly manner and always made to feel welcome. Very attentive service I would definitely recommend! I have to admit I haven't tried a lot of items on their menu, but from what I hear everything is very tasty."}
{"text":"I travel during the week for work and get home late Thursday evenings, and I always get takeout somewhere on the way home. This is my go-to stop for takeout because the food is good, it is quick and convenient, and the prices are fair. While the food doesn't blow you away, the quality and spiciness are both consistent (with spiciness based on a 1-to-10 scale), which is hard to find here in Pittsburgh at many Thai restaurants. Also, in my experiences dining in here, the waitstaff has always been very friendly and attentive. My favorite thing to order is the Kiew Wan with chicken and the Mangoes with Sticky Rice for dessert!"}
{"text":"First and far most people , I never write a bad review.  So imagine what an average experience I had. Actually, this isn't even a bad review. OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/"}
{"text":"I got Pad Thai take out when I was in Pittsburgh on business and it was pretty good.  The portion was decent, however I finished it all in one sitting.  It was $17, which had I not been on an expense account would've been way more than it was worth."}
{"text":"Ya,  never know what you will get at the Thai Place. I have had some great lunches with good service and horrible service with the wrong meal served before. It's a crap shoot at best. Their service will go to hell if more than 5 couples come in, which makes it tough to frequent. I do like the Pad, so it gets some reps. Take your chances."}
{"text":"Though I've never eaten inside I've had delivery (when they do it) from them numerous times.  The food is always quick to get here (sometimes so fast I wonder how long it was sitting out) and decent.  It isn't the best Thai in the area but it gets the job done cheap and they deliver (sometimes)."}
{"text":"Great place for weekday lunch.  Best Pad Thai around."}
