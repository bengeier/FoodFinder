{"text":"Passing through Monroe and stopped at the Hilltop for lunch.  They had a decent buffet.  Pass on ice tea.  There are water issues in Monroe and it tastes bad."}
{"text":"So first off, we were seated without menus and silverware. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted by a server. Salads took about 30 minutes, and still had to wait for the waitress to come back to give us silverware. Walked in at 7:15 for our reservation, food did not arrive until 8:30. Once the food arrived, it was cold and nasty. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and added grilled chicken. The Alfredo sauce was very watery, and the pasta was way over cooked. The chicken was also dry. By the time the checks came it was 9:30. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Usually when we eat at Hilltop, it's on a Sunday. My son loves the carved roast beef station on the Sunday buffet. And country style steak, fried chicken too...you know, like grandma's home-cooked food. The food that will make you go home and curl up in your recliner and take a nap. Always good. But that's Sunday. 

We decided to try Hilltop on a Friday night, for the first time. My gray-bearded husband tried to order the senior citizen flounder, because he wasn't very hungry, but they refused since he isn't 62.  So we both ordered the $13 seafood buffet. I tried the flounder filet (had some bones), the cajun whitefish, fried baby shrimp and large boiled shrimp, all of which were good. They also have catfish, scallops, stuffed crab, whole flounder, salmon patties, and crayfish. Hushpuppies were good. 

Buffet salad bar was very small and limited -- lettuce already mixed with tomatoes, onions. No bacon bits or cheese to add, and only ranch or thousand island dressing. The desserts were industrial -- big pans of below-average peach cobbler,  apple cobbler, and banana pudding.

My son ordered kids' chicken tenders with fries, and a side caesar salad. The salad was huge and he said it was good. The chicken tenders were hard and over-cooked, though. My dog thought they were great. 

We'll stick with the home-style Sunday buffet, since we didn't really love the seafood night buffet. But we do love the fact that Hilltop is on the south end of Monroe, which is convenient, and almost everyone who eats there is a local.  If  you've never been, you definitely need to go....it's definitely a Monroe tradition."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the service I received. If you are Black, please do not waste your time going here. I was treated very differently and asked three times if I paid for my food. I teach for my profession and I have my company. A lot of my other friends have had similar experiences and I don't see a black waitress in sight."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Was nervous because of some of the reviews but I think they were just disgruntled. We had 3 adults and 3 teens. We are from Colorado visiting my daughter at Wingate. None of us have a bad thing to say about our food. Portions were large (too large for my belly). One ordered the buffet and the rest from the menu. 
Fish tacos, clams (large ones not cherry stone small), chicken Spiro, 2 T-bones, catfish. 
All good!  Will for sure be back. Can not get over how large the place is!  The staff was all SO nice as well"}
{"text":"Not a very good buffet but if you're in a hurry, it's eatabe. Can't go wrong with the salad bar but few items on it (lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, and onions.
Price was good though. Just traveling thru but wouldn't stop again. Lots of meat on buffet but wasn't tastee.
Waitress was very nice and kept tea refilled."}
{"text":"Hilltop Bistro and Bar is just like Mama's home cooking.  I started with a Madras Martini, perfect in every way.  The buffet was my choice and I'm not a normal buffet participant.  The buffet station is raised which I like because I'm a tall lady, but I believe the buffet is raised to keep little hands from playing with the food. 

I enjoyed a bite of several meats.  I thought the shrimp was quite tasty, as well as the baked chicken with lemon pepper, the chicken livers were perfectly prepared, and the country style steak with gravy was delicious.  There was a large container of pulled pork, fried chicken, and fried fish.  

My favorite veggie was the broccoli casserole, and I tried the fried squash, homemade mashed potatoes and lima beans.  

The restaurant is very clean and the staff super friendly.  The noise level is moderate making for easy conversation.  

Our waitress Christina was attentive and friendly.  She was very knowledgable of the menu and kept our table neat and clean between visits to the buffet.

I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The oysters are not fresh, they were pre shucked. I was afraid to eat them I did not want to ingest bacteria. The buffet is overpriced. The food on the buffet tasted like institutional food or food from a budget cafeteria. My husband ordered an Italian dish. The pasta was overcooked (probably reheated in a microwave oven) there was nothing Italian about it! The tomato sauce  was pasty and bitter."}
{"text":"Host, which might be the owner or operator seemed very irritable with me and my family trying to find a table. He also seemed to be rude to his employees which made for an uncomfortable experience. Granted I went here on a Sunday, and it was busy, most people there were participating in the super long buffet line,....but do I really need to wait over 30 minutes to get a basic hamburger with fries plate?!....yes, I guess should have crossed the slam packed parking lot and gone to the Jack in the box...                     On a positive note, this was a very clean restaurant! And the burger was good!"}
{"text":"Went to hilltop with very high expectations. After being seated and our drink order being taken, we did not see a waiter/waitress for 10 mins. When the manager noticed my friends and I sitting there looking bored he approached us and informed us that someone would be right with us. This was not the case. After sitting for another 15 mins I had enough. They were not busy and this was ridiculous. I offered to pay for my drinks as my friends and I walked out. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast...it's a cool diner setting with country folk and spirit. The food is awful. My eggs had to be sent back twice, they charged an extra $2 when I wanted to exchange two cheeses for one different one, and my eggs were burned all three times. The server didn't tell us to pay up front and left us sitting at the table for 20 minutes. It's not worth it, find somewhere else to go! 

(It was so bad I actually created a yelp account to write a review)"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with the family. Three of us got the seafood buffet (about $16 pp). Not a large selection at the buffet. They tell you it comes with soup, salad bar, dessert bar... These are all at the same \"bar\". The salad bar portion consists of lettuce and two choices of dressing. Prime rib (an add-on for $7) came out cold and the au jus was rather salty. 
Homemade chips which came with my sons Reuben were very good. 
Wait staff was very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant which I am a frequent visitor I ordered the Prime Rib asked for medium and came out rear and asked for a fresh new piece and what do I get the same piece cut in the middle over cooked. The owners son \"Angelo\" was lecturing me about how beef is cut versus just apologizing and making excuses for his staff instead of just being courteous instead my anger and frustration I was told \" I was being ridiculous\"Enough to see where I can tell that I was being talked about and his staff looking at me but of course this is a family business not about keeping a customer happy and I could not eat dinner with my wife, by that time I did not want to eat or wait who wants to go to dinner and eat alone. Trust me I won't be back. Also, my wife went to the restroom and the staff were using the restroom with the door open and they did not wash there hands. \"Beware\" your food might  be contaminated from dirty hands. 
On that note you lost another customer and I am sure my review won't help either. I use Yelp all the time after being a long time customer I am know a lost customer. Awful customer service..."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at the hilltop. When they are on, the food is great and service is top-notch but when they are not on, you can wait a long time for your meal and the food can be marginal.

I like the Hilltop's menu however, because it is very diverse and there is something for everyone. They have a nice selection of seafood, chicken, and other meat that appeals to everyone, and they do have a good selection of pasta dishes and salads as well.

At their breakfast buffet, and I would not have it again, but I am not a big fan of breakfast buffets, and there's nothing on this one that makes it stand out. Having said that I've ordered their standalone breakfasts and they are good.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant and plan to eat there again."}
{"text":"You could drive to Charlotte  and waste 45 minutes on Highway 74? But why this is one of the best restaurants in the area. Complete menu with many favorites. I just had a Delmonico Rib Eye that rivals anyone's, my wife had stuffed Flounder that was excellent. Do yourself a favor and request Elena as your server!"}
{"text":"My father lives out in eastern Union County and I sometimes get to meet him out at restaurants out in Monroe. If you could only hear the sarcasm that is going through my mind right now.... Well for some reason he loves all the buffets in the area. I could care less about buffets personally but he put up with me growing up so I go where ever he wants. He promised me for my birthday this year we would not go to a buffet. Well, he lied. We went to Hill Top. I am not sure if there menu food is better but I will tell you the buffet was practically not edible. My stomach agreed with that statement because about an hour after leaving there it certainly was not very happy with me. I am not a southerner but I do like good old down home southern cooking but for some reason people down in Monroe like some crap food. You call it home cooking but it certainly is not. No offense to anyone in Union County you live in a beautiful area but your restaurants are horrible. Dad is coming to Charlotte for my birthday dinner from now on."}
{"text":"Delicioso!! The waitress was very polite!! The food was delicious! Nothing to complain about this place. Definitely very phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Hilltop and I have to say that while I'm quite impressed with the oyster bar the restaurant has much work to do in regards to customer service. 

We met some family here for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was not very busy but it took 18 minutes for someone to come take our drink order. They close at 5:00 on Sunday and we realized it was 5:01 and made our way to the door where 5 employees stood. Not one of them said goodbye or thank you. The main door was locked so we turned around to find the other exit and someone finally spoke to us to let us know they locked that door because they close at 5:00. 

Very poor management.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of our favorites in Monroe!!  The grilled blackened prime rib is to die for!  I'd much rather order than eat off of the buffet. We love the atmosphere and the variety of Greek inspired dishes. Definitely a place to have a great dinner in Monroe."}
{"text":"Ms. Mary Jean (I believe is her name) at the front counter is an absolute delight. She always ensures that customers are taken care of and checked out in a timely fashion. Today, my 89 year old friend and I were checking out, and she was SO patient with my friend.

I always enjoy my food, service, and the great place to meet my customers."}
{"text":"Marginal at best. Stopped for dinner on the way thru Monroe. Service was good. Food only so so. Probably pass next time thru."}
{"text":"Wanted to try Hilltop for some time now and am glad I did. Had the soup and sandwich for lunch. Turkey grilled cheese and clam chowder were both tasty. Want to go back for dinner sometime. I would caution those who take the \"bistro and bar\" literally but for a nice family eatery, you can't do much better in Monroe."}
{"text":"Sorry to have to come in as less than OK, but such was our experience for Thursday lunch.  Our convertible car club took a nice back road trip to have lunch here.  It had been highly recommended and lauded, so we were excited to be there.

Southern buffet and yes they had fried chicken, fried fish, fried squash and the boiled cabbage and carrots, along with other items to round it all out.  But is just was not very good.  My wife called it a \"miserable lunch.\"

Lots of tables as they tend to a lot of traffic, lunch and dinner.  Parking lot full and a line to go through the buffet so popular they are.  So let's look at why 2-stars.

Buffet itself tucked into a small area so was difficult to move around.  Salad bar was lettuce and lots of dressings, quantity and type, but rather limited in salad add-ons.  Rolls and hush puppies were at the end of the buffet horseshoe.  There were small fried shrimp, like those you would find accenting a side salad.  You needed a lot of scoops to get a portion on your plate and they were flavorless.

The \"raved about\" fried chicken was no big deal, more comparable to supermarket deli fried chicken that anything special.  There were small flat pieces of fried fish which were fine.  The fried squash was very good.

Dessert were a soon-to-be-gone tray of peach cobbler and then a tray of cherry cobbler which were both very pedestrian.  Truly canned fruit and a simple crust.  Runny and over sweet.

Service was excellent.  Those wait people hustle and have to cover drinks, busing and billing for a large number of people.  DeeDee was a champ and a bright spot amid a blight.

Buffet was $8.95 and beverages about $2 each.  It was $22.20 for the two of us which was buffet and iced tea.

I cannot imagine the steakhouse service.  

The locals like it...we did not."}
{"text":"Just came back from brunch.  Food was served hot and fast. Servers were quick to refill waters and coffee.  I had the reuben which was really good and they were not skimpy with the meat either and served on thick cut rye....they made it like I would have at home.  My girl had the shrimp and grits off the breakfast menu and she enjoyed it.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight it was delicious!!! We had The Appetizer Sampler; mozz sticks, spinach and artichoke dip and buffalo wings. Everything was great I'm a huge fan of spinach artichoke dip but its hard to find a place that does it right here it was flavorful cheesy and yummy. For Entrees I got the broiled Greek seafood combination plate with Zucchini fries & garlic mashed my Hubby got bacon wrapped steak medallions with grilled veggies. Mine was so good though the garlic mashed potatoes were just ok, the steak was tender moist & flavorful. For dessert we split a homemade Baklava it was sooooo good it just melted in my mouth. The staff was friendly and patient. The menu is big and kind of all over the place so it made choosing a heck of a lot more difficult. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Heard this place was good so I decide to take my family. It was the total opposite! I waited 10min for someone to get my drink order. When they finally came out my milkshakes were watery and nasty. The waitress didn't come to take my order and after a longer while I went to ask her to get my order. 1hr later and The food never arrived so I left and ask to pay for my drinks and they refused to let me pay for them. They wanted me to pay for my whole meal which I was not gonna do. After asking to speak with the manager 2 times they agreed to let me pay for the drinks. They were so rude and told me next time make sure you come with plenty of time on your hands. There won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Our first time having dinner at Hilltop.  Pleasant surprise! My husband and I had the seafood buffet. The buffet was $16.95 each, an amazing price. They have 99 cent oysters on the half shell downstairs.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"First time here. Everything was wonderful from the front desk, atmosphere, wait staff and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Monroe a few months ago, we have officially settled in and found our favorite restaurant!!!!  I love the atmosphere you can show up dressed to the nines or in jeans and a tee shirt and feel totally comfortable.  This place is beautiful, clean and huge! The parking lot was completely full we had to park next door but it only took a few minutes to be sat.  Then that's when our dinning experience really began, our server Christina was super friendly and knowledgable she had no problem guiding us through the expansive menu. My husband had the stuffed flounder which was delicious and I had the Spiro chicken that was topped with goat cheese. It was fantastic!!!! We walked (more like waddled we were so full) through the restaurant checking it out, we were impressed! We ventured downstairs to The Oyster Bar that is more laid back we decided to try that next! I hope you do yourself a favor and check this place out! If you get Christina you're in for a real treat but to be honest all the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for  27 years. Spiro offers the best food available in this area. His food is consistently great. Prices are fare and competitive. He offers a breakfast buffet with all your favorites. He also has a very tasty country lunch buffet. At night the fare changes to a seafood smorgasbord. His menu food selections are enormous. Eat here and if you go away hungry, it's your fault.  
This the place to go to meet old friends and make new ones. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"In all honesty, Hilltop's a diamond-in-the-rough, gem-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, oasis-in-the-restaurant-desert-that-is-the-Monroe/Wingate-border sort of restaurant. Not only are its exterior façade, interior décor, and waitstaff surprisingly pleasing [and dare I say random for a place so far removed from Indian Trail and Matthews], Hilltop substantiates itself with quality Southern cuisine, a bustling-yet-kicked-back atmosphere, and overall service that exemplifies Southern hospitality. Monroe/Wingate residents ought be grateful for this eatery nestled right in their backyard.

A pharmacy school student at Wingate University myself, I've now frequented Hilltop for all of breakfast, lunch and dinner, well as any alcohol wants/needs. Ordering from their menu (and a hefty one at that!) is always available, but it's worth noting that an EXCELLENT spread is offered with their breakfast buffet and then later with their lunch/dinner one. And as if Hilltop's prices weren't already a steal, daily specials are highlighted both as you walk in and atop your menu. Whatever you decide, it's rare to leave disappointed -- food taste and quality are excellent and portion sizes more than enough.

Accommodations include 5 different main dining areas -- 1 of which can be partitioned off accordingly, another which is an upstairs balcony, and yet another that includes stools at their open-faced kitchen -- a large bar, and even a side patio. Moreover, a private meeting room is available upon reservation. Past the bar and down a staircase is situated yet another hangout area, nicely separated from the bulk of the restaurant.

FYI... (1) there's free WiFi -- it's just extremely unreliable especially during peak rushes; (2) inform the host/hostess if TV seating is preferred; (3) despite opposing reviews, the level of care and attentiveness shown to my party by Hilltop's staff/management has ALWAYS exceeded expectations; (4) take advantage of their VERY wallet-friendly deals for breakfast/lunch -- feel free to ask your server what the kitchen can whip up for you; (5) give the weekend seafood buffet a go; (6) abundant private parking; (7) ideal for students -- discounts with ID, free + unlimited coffee refills, large bar w/ continuous sports coverage, catering services, etc.

Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)...
- Overall recommendation = 4.75
- Food taste and quality = 4.75
- Portion size = 5
- Price = 4.5
- Atmosphere = 5+
- General service = 4.25

{"text":"Great food great times! Always nice to stop in here when I am in Monroe nc! I thank you for all the great years of food and the smiles I thank you all!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim this morning and wish we would have kept driving. Maybe our big mistake was getting the buffet.  The fried chicken was old, the calabash shrimp were tiny, over-breaded and had too much grease and the sides on the buffet were bland.  My husband said the carved roast beef was really tough. On top of all that, just getting from the tiny buffet area back to our table was an adventure in nightmare logistics. The front door splits the restaurant in two, so you have to maneuver through crowds waiting for a table with plates in your hands.

Perhaps ordering  off the menu would have been a better choice, but I don't see us going back to give it the chance."}
{"text":"Hilltop is one of the more popular local restaurants in Union County and it's pretty easy to see why. They offer a lunch buffet, which is personally not my type of thing, but to my understanding it is usually packed. The staff here were quite friendly and took the time to explain the specials. It seems to be a popular meeting place for local politicians and business leaders.

I have not had the fish from here and cannot comment much on the food as I have only been here twice. I had the spring salad this time and it was full of fresh fruit, tomatoes, pecans, and paired with strawberry vinaigrette dressing. 

The restaurant separates with two different areas, to the right is the buffet side and the left is the regular menu. The general layout is comfortable with booth and table seating available. The place is very clean.

Plus is that the menu is pretty diverse and you should have no problem finding something you like here."}
{"text":"Good, reliable comfort food. Best Fried Squash around! Fresh food, clean, lots of variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Large portions for a great price. It's a step up from your typical diner. Looks like they had a very nice breakfast buffet. Great grits!"}
{"text":"First visit to Hilltop since my grandparents took me there...oh... about 50 years ago! Of course, it certainly has changed since then - namely there's a bar which was not there 50 years ago (that would have been SO inappropriate in Monroe!)
I was on my way to the coast and drove through Monroe at lunchtime. We decided to stop at Hilltop. They offer a very nice buffet in addition to their menu. We went the buffet route and enjoyed soup, salads, fried chicken (yea!), tender braised pork loin and vegetables. Vegetables could have been better but everything else was fine."}
{"text":"8am and not many locals in here. Not a good sign. 
The breakfast buffet was weak. The bacon was crispy and plentiful but then the eggs were scrambled and tasteless. Seemed to be powered eggs or something other than fresh eggs. 

I ask for a large orange juice and received a small 10 ounce bottle of OJ I could have gotten at the gas station. I was never ask if I wanted another or any water. 
I tried the pancakes also and they were ok. It's pretty hard to ruin batter from a box and a griddle. 


I have eaten here several times before in the evening and things were better. 
Maybe this is not a breakfast spot. 


I'll go back to Bojangles for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Diner-style eating with a wide menu ranging from burgers to sandwiches to salads and several different entrees. Fried clams and oysters appear to be a specialty of the house. Walking in to the vestibule is a cooler displaying some of their specials - the chef salad plate must be a foot wide and appears to contain more \"stuff\" than lettuce.

As delicious as that looked, I wasn't in a salad mood today. I went with a corned beef sandwich, which claimed to have a half pound of meat in it on grilled rye bread. It turned out to be less than that and had unadvertised (swiss?) cheese, but was still very tasty. I skipped the fries and had their potato salad, which was creamy and spicy and had some nice large chunks of potato. Unfortunately, they were out of spicy brown mustard and I had to settle for dijon.

My coworker went with the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. Three thick slices of ham and cheese on top of a chicken breast that was larger than the bun. He had the fries and I was glad I skipped them because they were just the standard plain crinkle cut fries and weren't worth the calories.

Both sandwiches also came with a small bowl of cole slaw (didn't taste home-made) and a slim pickle spear. The service was good and our server refilled our drinks a couple of times. The restaurant was a little on the chilly side - possibly overcompensating for the 80 degree heat wave outside.

While we were waiting for the waitress to take our check, we spotted another server bringing out a club sandwich that was a tall stack of meat and cheese and veggies on toast, of course cut into quarters. It looked excellent and if I am back in the neighborhood and visit Hill Top, I'll have that.

Excellent food and one of the few restaurants in the area that is neither Mexican (had that for lunch yesterday) or a chain like Jack-in-the-Box or Bojangles. I'd recommend skipping the standard fare and enjoy Hill Top."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  It has consistently over the years, had great food offerings from the menu, and we love the breakfast and dinner buffets.  They never disappoint.  It's clean, reasonable, and delicious food.  My Dad and I eat there a lot traveling between Marshville and his home.  This is one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good. The buffet is usually hot and a nice variety of food but the staff isn't very friendly.  The update that they did a few years ago really seems to help the overall look of the place.  It really needed the updating.  If you are looking for a decent buffet for the going rate this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I heard good things about this restaurant from the locals and while it maybe one of the best in town my meal was basically not edible. The seafood buffet (mostly fried) looked ok but I didn't do the buffet. Instead I had the grilled Covina and it was disgusting! The fish was soggy, over cooked, fishy and tasted like it was going bad. I could not eat it for the taste and fear of being sick. Don't believe I have ever and I mean ever had a piece of fish that bad in a restaurant. I have grilled corvina many times at home and it was nothing like this. In fact it is one of my favs. If I cooked this it would have gone right in the trash. The risotto was creamy but it was like over cooked rice with heavy cream added. No seasoning and no flavor. The house salad tasted like bagged or lettuce that had been shredded hours ago: couldn't eat anything but the tomatoes and cukes. Service was good and helpful. Nice restaurant inside. Too bad they can't compliment the service and surroundings with good food."}
{"text":"We don't actually head down this way too often, but oddly enough we've eaten at Spiro's a few times. I don't know why that is exactly. Seems like most times it has been for breakfast, usually as we're headed to the beach, or at the very least, places east, and that's probably why - there just aren't too many options that aren't fast food.

The service is reasonable, mostly because they are a buffet, so all they really need to do is provide you with a seat, and point you to the food, and in that matter it's a reasonable option. Is it better than the fast food? Perhaps. You get to sit in a nice enough place and the food is decent, but it's not a huge selection, so it's probably worth a stop if you would like something different - but if you're in a rush, there are options (the Jack in the Box is right next door after all)."}
{"text":"I think my mistake might have been to get pasta at a seafood place but I've gotten seafood pasta at other seafood places before and it was pretty good. I am not too picky about my pasta but wow. I was so hungry I ate at least half my food but if I had the choice I would not get it again. It was very watery (looked like soup) the pasta was over cooked, and I even tasted something hard while eating it (assuming it was an egg shell or something). Another thing to note is our server...she was a nice lady but not a very good server. She not only  gave me the wrong dressing but brought out my pasta and salad at the same time. Since I used to be a server that is a big pet peeve of mines lol. On top of that my boyfriend never received a napkin with his silverware, we had to share my napkin. I was debating on eating the buffet but after seeing the hygiene of the staff with it I would not. We were seated near the kitchen so I saw how food was handled and prepared. Overall I would not come back. I gave two stars because the decoration was nice and my boyfriend liked his fish but on my experience I couldn't give it more."}
{"text":"I love Hilltop. I go at least once a week. They have a very extensive menu and also a very good lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I used to come to Hilltop frequently for lunch.  Their chili (which comes with cornbread) is my favorite.  It's spicy and sweet at the same time.  I really love getting this and haven't been nearby lately, so miss it!  They have a huge variety of items to choose for lunch as well as a buffet.

The service is always decent.  They get you out pretty fast if you are in a hurry.  I would like to come back sometime to try their oysters for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good. They are just a little pricey on some items. I brought my parents here for breakfast when they came to visit, everyone really enjoyed it. If you want fruit, like the strawberry pie filling the advertised with waffles & pancakes, expect them to come out cold. I was disappointed when I realized they came directly from the fridge, but I'm sure they would have warmed them at request. 
I really enjoyed the $.50 wings they have Sun-Thurs downstairs in the oyster bar. I have certain expectations when it comes to buffalo wings & they definitely met them."}
{"text":"Hilltop is a great restaurant. The food is great, the wait staff is friendly, and the decor is also nice. Two types of environment available upstairs for a nice restaurant experience or downstairs for a bar experience. Absolutely love to go when they have the all you can eat seafood buffet. My favorite thing off the menu is the lobster ravioli, to die for!"}
{"text":"WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!

This is our 2nd visit. And it was absolutely AWFUL!! We will never go here again. We ordered chicken fingers dinner and fish dinner. It was taking too long for the food to come out and I asked the waiter (Robert) what is going on? He said there was grease on the plate and when he grabbed it, the plate fell over. I told him to make sure my wife food is cooked over and is fresh as well since she had to wait for my food. He said it will be cooked over again fresh also. I observed a plate of food just sitting there. GUESS WHAT? It was my wife's plate. He \"tried\" to bring the food out as if it was fresh and I told him this is not fresh b/c it is the same plate I saw sitting up there. He said I can get you a manager. And when the manager (George) came out, I told him that we would just pay for our drinks and we were going to leave because of the lies, food and service. He said to me, \"You can't just leave without paying. You act like the food was sitting up there for 2 days\" My wife said we will pay for her food but not mine and we are leaving. I was appalled by his comments. WE WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN!!!! 

It is really sad when a restaurant doesn't realize that your BEST advertisement is word of mouth. I am going to make sure I let as many review websites know about this service and the unacceptable work ethics the waiter and manager displayed!"}
{"text":"Ooph. This place was a hot mess when I came in. I had heard it was pretty good by other friends, so it must be a hit-or-miss kind of restaurant.

I came in with a friend for lunch, and we both got water. The water tasted like dirty tapwater that someone stuck their finger in.

I ordered a veggie wrap for lunch with their homemade chips as my side. The waitress came over and asked if we needed anything else. I asked her for a side of ranch.

Now let's talk about the wrap. They apparently feel that a veggie wrap means that they throw in whatever vegetables they might happen to have left over. I'm talking about uncooked squash, tiny chopped carrots, tiny pieces of cucumber, random pieces of onion, etc. 

I could have possibly stomached the wrap, if I had some ranch. She literally came back with our checks and brought ranch with her. She asked if I would still like it, and I said no that's all right thank you. Then I saw her walk with the ranch back into the kitchen, probably to give to someone else. Gross.

On the plus side, the homemade chips were delicious!"}
