{"text":"Great food and great service when I decide to stay at the restaurant itself. It is a great place to take your time and have a great conversation. The waiters never rush you as they slowly serve each course in a timely manner. Price is a little expensive for only the individual orders but lunch menu is flexible."}
{"text":"Best fried noodles in Montreal, maybe even on the continent.  I brought my family from California here for dinner when they visited Quebec and several years later, they still say that this is the best Chinese food they have ever had."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Laval. You cannot go wrong with the food here, large portions and very flavourful unlike what you would get in an all you can eat type setting. We go at least once a month!"}
{"text":"amazing general tao chicken!!! the best in town!!! noodles too!!! great deals for lunch specials but the best for evening to go in groups cuz of the big round tables!!! perfect for families :D definitely recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Tres ordinaire un  resto  chinois bien typique  cher  ,et  a  la  qualitee  douteuse.ambience mousade  parfait  pour  gens non epicurien.je  ny  retourne  pas  cest  garantie"}
{"text":"Overall pretty pretty good.  I enjoyed beef broccoli and general Tao chicken.  Egg roles not bad.  Overall, good enough to go back."}
{"text":"A nice Chinese place to have a nice quick bite. The food portions were very good, and the food was tasty. We had Chow Mein, General Tao's Chicken, Seafood Mix, Fried Rice with Chicken. The price is very reasonable compared to the quality and quantity. 
The downside is the \"ok\" service where we were not really assisted. The atmosphere is very boring, all quiet and no music whatsoever which made us not feel comfortable eating or even chatting. 
We had one incident, my wife found a hair in her soup. We did inform the waiter and he apologized, took the soup, threw it out then got us a new one. It was a quick replacement. 
If it wasn't for the downsides I would have rated the pace 4 stars. I might \"if in the area\" pass by again."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant m'a été conseillé par un collègue de travail, je suis allé voir les commentaires sur yelp. En voyant le 4 étoiles je me suis dit, qu'on allait  l'essayer en famille. 
Je mange de la cuisine asiatique depuis que j'ai l'age de 8 ans. J'ai essayer beaucoup de restaurant a montreal et ses environs. Ce resto est dans les moins bons que j'ai essayé. 

On a pris la soupe wonton au crevettes, les wontons étaient correct sans plus mais le bouillons, fade, sans vraiment de gout. 

Le boeuf aux sésames sauce était vinaigré a souhait et le boeuf goutait le vieux et était raid comme de la semelle. 

Le tofu frit goutait le fromage ce qui est bizarre pour du tofu. 

Les crevettes sel poivre, sont petites et tres ordinaire. 

Le riz maison, on dirait du riz préparé et congelé. 

Je me suis plaint pour le boeuf et il m'a été remboursés, le serveur était aimable mais la salle a manger était sale et les assiettes usées. Le prix est raisonnable et les portions généreuses. L'arrière gout de MSG fait en sorte qu'on goute l'ail toute la journée dans notre bouche. Tout ça fait que je n'y retournerais pas, il y'a trop d'autres restos qui en vaille la peine pour que je retourne la. Je comprends vraiment pas ceux qui donnent 4 étoiles. Allez essayer le wing phat sur jarry et après on verra comment vous notez ce resto."}
{"text":"I have come to the conclusion that i do not like Chinese food outside of the US. I've now had Chinese in Guatemala and the US and it's something about that Americanized version that I love. the food here was kind of bland for me, heavy on the garlic. I would not go out of my way to go back but it was edible. service was great as we went with people who know the owners but I just didn't like the food"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting good service. They will barely look at you when you walk in and you seat yourself. Don't let this discourage you though, it's probably the best Chinese food in Laval and they step up to the plate when they need to. Once there was a hair in one of the dishes we had ordered and they were quick to give us a new dish and take it off of our bill.

The food is either hit or miss so you have to know what to order. It's family style, so big plates meant to be shared. My personal favourites are the salt and pepper chicken and the wonton soup. The wontons are perfect, not too much wrapper and filled with shrimp like they should be. It's also pretty good value for your money, you could get away with spending 40$ for two people and still have leftovers tomorrow."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hoopla. It's average. The food was fine, although some of the plates looked like replicas of others with mild differences. Parking is terrible. And you might stand in line for 45 minutes. but the place was packed... So maybe all those people know more than I do. Try it!"}
{"text":"I was staying in downtown Montreal and not impressed with the Chinese food restaurant options . I went to a place on st Catherine and was mediocre . After searching for a new place , I opted
To drive to Laval 40 minutes for a Chinese and was not let down . The portions are huge and reasonable pricing . I am from New York and a tough critic on Chinese food . We ordered for two people organdy beef ( crispy and tasty ) , general tao chicken , chicken fried rice and Chinese broccoli . Way too much food but worth it !!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent value for money oriental cuisine situated in the heart of Laval for those individuals who like to eat like a king at the price of a regular citizen."}
{"text":"So good! So good! Hurray! We were driving back from the Laurentians when a fierce Chinese food craving hit. Undeniable. Popped open the Yelp app and found this Kam-Shing glowing like a beacon up ahead, open for action at 4pm on a holiday Monday like some sort of gift from the gods. 

We were the only ones there. Service was professional, calm and friendly and seamlessly bilingual. We ordered way too much food and we were not judged.

The food came quick, fresh and hot. Tofu General Tao that was light, crispy and flavourful. Crispy vegetable noodles that didn't taste heavy and thick. Orange beef thin, light, crispy and tart and spicy. 

Delicious tea. A calm early evening in the rain. Warm tasteful red decor, big windows, everything immaculately clean. Just a lovely experience overall.

We did wish for some more vegetable dish options than what were available- a spicy eggplant or garlic greens would have been great. And it would be so awesome to get other dishes done veg - like a tofu black bean for example.

Just dreams but definitely a sweet spot tucked in a mini strip mall in Laval!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant asiatique. Des plats à partager autour d'une grande table ronde. La soupe au won ton est très bonne. Un gros bol à paratger avec une vingtaine de won ton aux crevettes. Les meilleurs dumplins aux crevettes sauce aux arachides que j'ai goûté jusqu'à maintenant. Apparemment le général Tao est excellent... À essayer la prochaine fois."}
{"text":"Excellent food, a wide variety of choises. The food is ALWAYS hot and fresh. Cleanliness could be improved. Great prices. All in all the service is quick although grumpy. A great Chinese Joint!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chinese/schezuan. THis place was good. THe general Tao and the beef broccoli were AMAZING. EVerything else, though, tasted exactly like the previous dish. The peking duck tasted like the sweet & sour chicken which tasted like the stir fried vegetables. I wasn't a big fan of the \"special rice\" which is pretty much a mix of previous dishes that weren't eaten (or so i was told). Parking was a disaster. A tiny little parking lot in a strip mall. It was horrendous. I would go back just for the general tao & beef broccoli! This place deserves the 4 * just for those 2 dishes!  Anything else though, I wasn't really impressed"}
{"text":"Been here enough to tell you the food is consistently decent, nothing amazing though. I like their orange beef and broccoli beef the most but I've been here often enough to say it's a reliable place to eat some comfort Asian food."}
{"text":"La nourriture est toujours de très bonne qualité. Les assiettes sont généreusement garnies. Mon met préféré est la soupe Won-Ton aux crevettes."}
{"text":"Kam Shing is my personal favorite Chinese restaurant, and I have tried many. The service might discourage you at first; grumpy Chinese servers, hard to understand both in French and English, but that's something I personally expect walking in a non-expensive Chinese restaurant. The food however is fresh and delicious. Everything is so cheap and comes with generous portions. My favorite meal is the fried noodles with beef and broccoli. It is the best chow neon I've had in my life. Their General Tao is also amazing."}
{"text":"Took a chance and followed Yelp reviews to chose this restaurant and very glad I did. Service was very good with friendly waiter plus the chef even came by to greet me. I had the best paid Thai I have ever had. I will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Some good dishes, good service, many tables, parking availble, i will recomend the shrimps and vegetables."}
{"text":"petite découverte asiatique grâce à un ami yelp. l'intérieur fait penser à un restaurant rapide mais il n'en est pas. côté service,  la nourriture arrive rapidement,  Mais pour le reste il faut demander parce qu'il ne viennent pas te voir. 

Pour la nourriture,  wow.  les prix sont 6 à 15$ environ,  Sauf que se sont de grosses assiettes à partager (voir photo).  Pour la taille et le goût,  le prix est très bien. 

J'ai essayer le poulet général tao et le porc mushu. les boucher du poulet était très grosse et bien cuite.  malheureusement parfois il y avait de petit morceau sec que j'ai eu de la difficulté à couper et mâcher avec mes dents en plastique (broches). Il y à beaucoup de sauce dans le plats,  ce qui est très intéressant pour moi puisque j'adore les sauces.  Par contre,  elle à un goût subtile,  pas aussi prononcer que d'autre. 

Pour le porc mushu, c'était notre première fois.  c'était très bon,  malgré que je n'ai pas aimé le goût de la sauce mais ma copine à adoré,  C'est une question de goût je n'aime pas ce genre de sauce.  heureusement elle est dans un plat séparer,  J'ai donc pu utiliser la sauce du poulet à la place et c'était très bon. 

le menu est très énormes.  On dépasse les 120 choix facilement,  porc,  boeuf,  poulet,  végétarien,  tofu,  riz, nouille, soupes et j'en passe. 

Pour la quantité de choix,  les prix et la quantités,  5 étoiles. 

Mais j'enlève une étoile à cause du service bizarre et la sauce un peu fade ainsi que les morceaux de poulets sèches.  Mais je vais y retourner ses sur essayer plein d'autre chose."}
