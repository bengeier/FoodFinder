{"text":"Another work-in-progress vendor at the front of Gordo's, Ko'ox Haná is a Mayan takeaway kiosk with dishes by Lucy Novelo. I tried their signature dish and it is pulled pork with a tomato sauce with some onions sprinkled on top, along with a black refried bean side to spread on the taco shells they provide. If anyone is a fan of Mexican food, go to Ko'ox Haná and try their hot sauce!  Very nice with a sweet afterburner effect. Check it out for something a little different. I'll try something else next time but their signature dish is decent and enough to share between two people for $12."}

The food made me feel like I was in Mexico. The woman running it was really nice too. Try it out!!  Cochinita Pibil and Poc Chuc we're both great!"}
{"text":"Ko'ox Hana is a great place to get some cheap, filling, tasty eats. They have an option where you can choose 3 items for $9.99. Some of these items include tamales, panuchos, salbutes, tacos (cochinita pibil), or some undefined vegetarian dishes.   I got two salbutes and a taco. According to the menu, those are slightly sauteed tortillas covered in shredded chicken or achiote grilled pork, along with the \"perfect garnish\". Slightly sauteed actually seemed more fried than sauteed, but I actually preferred it fried to slightly sauteed. I actually wasn't asked whether I wanted the chicken or the pork and I didn't realize until they put the chicken option down. I actually wanted the pork. I should have asked. For those of you who were wondering, the perfect garnish included was lettuce, pickled onions, avocado slices, and queso. My avocado was had some brown spots, but other than that and the chicken thing, these were very tasty, and at $10, very good.  No tamales this time, but I'm excited to try a lot more next time."}
