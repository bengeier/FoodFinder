{"text":"Went 2 this place for the first time my food was cold I ordered breakfast the bacon was hard and old tasting the eggs were cold the hash browns look like they were frozen and greasy tasting even my toast was cold the waitress seem like she was always running for nothing she seem like she didn't know what she was doing never ask how food was set the check down with r/food will never be back too many other places to have a good breakfast and good service"}
{"text":"Today was the fifth visit to Kosta and Vic's and, again, no surprise, a great experience. We have been three times for breakfast and today was the second lunch visit. In all honesty, wish they were open for dinners because I would think the place would be jam packed. The food, service, prices, location, and everything is just perfect! The menu choices are abundant, to say the least. There is no question we will return for a sixth visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for our second time for lunch and was just as great if not better than the first time. Food was served hot and quick. Service was great everyone was friendly. Prices couldnt be any better.Great food large portions priced way to cheap. Definitely will be back. Atmosphere was delightful staff was smiling and being very tentative to the customers needs. Everything was  very clean. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Nice people food above average but not great. Will go back for another time.
Biscuits and gravy, gravy was different taste but not bad.
I felt the food taste may be due to what kinds of oil they use.
Worth a try, K&V welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here.  Came on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  Was suprised at how small it is inside, and how closely sat everyone is. Definitely a small diner atmosphere. I ordered their potato pancakes and a side of bacon.  The potato pancakes were a bit dry and could have used more egg to bind them together.   The bacon was likely made 4 hrs earlier and just piled on the side of the grill, it was hard and could easily tell it wasn't recently made.  I will probably give this place one more shot."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast.  Haven't been there since they opened.  Waited quite some time for eggs.  But what I noticed was that everything on the table was greasy.  The bowl that creamers were in was sort of disgusting really.  Needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"Apparently the other jacka** of the restaurant needs to chime in too. Neither can read. I had the biscuit and gravy combo, so yes everything else was fine. I'll just call and talk to you since you don't understand the point of my opinion.
Update: The owner is a jacka** who can't handle a bad review. How about instead of bashing me in your comments, you fix the issues I expressed. If no one acknowledges me and my issue at the restaurant how can I fix it before writing my review. Suggesting that I warm my food in the microwave is just shows you don't really care. This is my opinion and I'm entitled to it. You just lost the chance that I would ever come back, and I'll spread the word.

Not sure if I just went to breakfast or the circus. There was way to much going on in a small space. Balloon creations are for a slow Wednesday night to get families in, not a busy Saturday morning. The food is cheap and kind of reflected that. I got the biscuit and gravy combo. Everything was fine, except my biscuits and gravy that were cold. Nothing about the experience makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"have gone there for breakfast plenty of times, as i live within walking distance. took my mom for the first time tuesday for quick lunch and after a few bites of sandwich, we realized her rye bread was moldy. told the server who shrugged it off with a quick 'im sorry' -she did offer to make her a new one but we were on a time crunch. 

when i paid, the owner asked how our service was and i again mentioned the moldy bread. another quick apology and blaming the company that delivers the bread. I understand it wasn't the restaurants fault but not once did they offer to take the sandwich off the bill. he slipped in a 20% off coupon with my receipt and said 'come back soon' but really, i dont understand how you don't take that meal off the bill, as she was not able to eat it after the mold was discovered. mom is big on customer service and has already told like 5 people in my neighborhood not to go there."}
{"text":"We absolutely love eating there, food is great and everyone is so very friendly, my coffee cup was never empty."}
{"text":"Breakfast in NE Ohio is a real decision. So many places, so many options. Near the corner of York and Sprague Roads in the DMZ between Parma, Parma Heights and North Royalton is a noisy, bustling family restaurant called Kosta and Vic's. Although there are many family eateries in the area, with similar menus, prices and qualitiy of food, K&V stands out in a couple of ways. The restaurant is bright and cheery, bustlingly busy every time I've been here, but I've never had to wait for a table. And although they are in no danger of receiving a Michelin star, the fare is always hot, good and pretty fast. The restaurant is clean, the prices are very good as is the service. This is a nice step up from standard \"family restaurants\" in terms of atmosphere and service, while still keeping the quality and price point competitive. I don't come here looking for culinary innovation or the cache' of saying \"I had breakfast at (restaurant X)\"...I come here looking for quality, value, and service and they deliver every time."}
{"text":"Well, George K decided he wasn't happy with my review and decided to write a condescending, smartass reply to my initial comments - instead of privately messaging me and saying \"hey, sorry your canned corned beef hash wasn't any better than he canned slop you can buy at Walmart.\" Instead, I'm supposed to give only glowing reviews for canned slop or at least tell the server/manager that it's canned slop - as if they don't know. Well, i'm not interested in getting my money back. Instead I move on, note my experience and don't go back. It's not my job to manage your restaurant or your staff.
He'd also like to have Costa and Vic's removed from Yelp so that others can't read negative reviews like mine and choose a better, fresher option for their meal. Somehow pointing out that my meal sucked on Yelp is some form of extortion - as if I've asked him to pay me in order to remove my review - maybe he should get a dictionary.
I don't normally use this kind of language in my reviews, but FUCK businesses like this. I DEFINITELY WON'T GIVE THIS ASSHOLE ANOTHER CENT OF MY MONEY. 
By the way, it's not far from the Southside Diner which was also cramped when we went, but WAY FUCKING BETTER.

WHAT A DICK."}
{"text":"Food tasted great. Service was good. Nice portions at low prices. The gyro is absolutely delicious. The owner comes out and talks to his patrons...which is how it should be. Enjoyed our late lunch. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not a 5 is because I can't rank it as the ultimate best family restaurant I 've ever been to in my life. I will tell you, the food was good, the place was clean and my server (sorry I can't remember his name) was awesome! The other staff was attentive and friendly. 
I've read the other reviews and see that at one time there appears to have a staff attitude problem. Well, not now! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well Mike Z...you have certainly changed my mind after that long winded condescending response to mine and others reviews. I can't wait to rush back and have another crack at the fine precooked Hormel bacon offered in your establishment. If I spoke up I would've received a new order of the same precooked crappy bacon and as you said to someone else \"ain't nobody got time for that\". Another interesting observation Mike Z...there's a 5 star review from a month ago calling for an end to the negative reviews for Kosta and Vic's from Andrew Z...any relation? The guy only has 3 reviews, that looks pretty suspicious. Are you now using Yelp in the same way that you are accusing others of using it? It also calls for the Kosta and Vic's challenge to let them earn your business back. Judging by the way you treat former customers that ship has sailed my friend. There are too many other good options around for anyone to spend another dime in your establishment. Judging by your negative responses it seems you are going under and very frustrated and want to place blame on everyone but your restaurant and product. Well, man up and own it and look in the mirror the next time you point that condescending finger. Have a nice day and best of luck in turning Kosta and Vic's into a real restaurant."}
{"text":"First time visit to this restaurant, was recommended by a co worker. Good breakfast, large portion and a sweet waitress, Tammy C. I will return, however it will have to be on a Tuesday!  :-)"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for my dad's birthday breakfast a few days ago due to a recommendation from friends.  From the outside, it looks very much like the Donatos that it once was and  a little bit cheesy with the flags and bright colors, but once you go in through the entrance, it feels like a homey restaurant.  We were welcomed by a cheery hostess and a big board full of breakfast specials (including all you can eat pancakes and/or french toast for $5.99... what a deal!).  We sat down and ordered our breakfasts; I got the ham and cheese omelet with hashbrowns and toast.  The omelette came out huge and steaming on the plate with perfectly cooked potatoes (I HATE when they come out white and droopy).  Everyone enjoyed their food, and the waitress was friendly without being up in our business the whole time.  The only weird thing about her was that when I got a refill, she brought back half a glass \"since many people don't finish the second one.\" 

Looking at the menu, I'd like to come back and try lunch too!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Kosta & Vic's a higher rating. We have been here quite a bit over the last year. However, this is my first review of the place. We visited the diner on a Wednesday morning, around 11:00am. This visit is just like every other one we've had at Kosta & Vic's. 
It's truly a family diner with the owner walking around every time we've been there, checking on the guests. Our visits are always the same - great food but awful service. The \"hostess\" this morning stood up from her bench behind the counter when we walked in and asked us how many (no \"hello\", no \"welcome\", no \"follow me\"...nothing), she grabbed the menus and started walking. She got to the table about 5 seconds before we did, placed the menus on the table and kept walking. The worst hostess ever - made us feel completely unwelcomed and as if we interrupted her sit down time! 
The waitress was pretty friendly and the amount of time it took to place our order and receive our food was quick. I really enjoyed my veggie omelet! I always order my hash browns well done and this time the waitress actually asked me if they were to my satisfaction (which they were). I feel as if they water down the apple juice? Maybe? My husbands \"Crazy 8 Breakfast\" was perfect. He went through his eggs, bacon, sausage and French Toast like a champ! So, we wrapped up our breakfast and went to the counter to get our bill and pay. Unfortunately, it was with the unfriendly hostess. Again, no \"thanks\", no \"how was everything\", nothing. The first and last impression this lady is leaving with the guests is not a good one. I will definitely be back but I won't expect to be welcomed with words or a smile if the same lady is present."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now with a couple of different people. We have all liked it very much. There does seem to be a bit of a wait for your order to come out but it may be because they usually have a almost full restaurant. The waitresses do get your coffee order right away and also do their best to keep them filled up. The first time I had tried the traditional eggs, hash browns, rye toast and sausage patties. It was made to order and very good. Next time I had tried the vegetable omelet but asked to have ham and cheese added to it. It also comes with hash browns and toast. It may be my new favorite!"}
{"text":"The food sucks, the staff sucks, the owner sucks, the price sucks. It's small, it's dirty, it's loud, it's poorly lit. They write fake reviews as well. I'm sure most of these positive reviews on here are BS. The owner is just some obnoxious man child that get's angry when someone doesn't agree with him. The only reason they even exist still is because they have a huge influx of senior citizens who must have dementia. I say this because nobody in their right state of mind would ever step foot in this filthy rats nest that allows employees to sit around and curse while you wait 20 minutes for below average food in a restaurant that is caked with dust and grime. Just the thought of giving this place any more money is totally absurd. They don't even know how to cook eggs. I mean even a 5 year old can cook an egg if you teach them. Just take your money and go buy some McMuffins at the nearby McDonalds. It will not only save you money, but it will taste better, and believe it or not it will probably be more healthy than choking down the swill they serve here. I despise the fact that I have to leave one star. They deserve none. Only come here if you hate yourself and want zero satisfaction in life. That is the only time it will ever make sense to even step foot in this poor excuse of a restaurant. Just thinking about the piece of earth this junk heap is built upon depresses me. The earth does not deserve to be sullied by this scourge that has been placed upon it. A bulldozer and wrecking ball need to cleanse this place and rid it from our lands. Then all of the wreckage and remains of this waste of materials must never be recycled, but rather taken by helicopter and then dropped in a volcano, thus obliterating it from the face of the earth. Then all the people who have ever ate here should all be taken to a facility where they use that thing from Men in Black and wipe our memories clean of this wretched place, thus freeing us of any lingering regret we may have had for giving this place money. Then and only then would we truly be free from the cancer known as Kosta and Vic's."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to the restaurant.  We weren't excited with the first one but it was the grand opening week and they were overwhelmed.  This visit disappointed as well.  We ordered chicken salad on a croissant,  odd that it was served with Cole slaw, pickle and a side salad.  Fresh fruit would have been a best choice.  Tasted like it was scooped out of a costco deli pack.  Not impressive at all.  Second meal was the stall salad, ordered to be cooked medium.  Large portion, steak had an odd taste and was over cooked. Table next to us had the same salad and sent it back.  

Service was great,  food not so great. 

Would not recommend a visit."}
{"text":"OMG the food is out  of this world!  I had the home homemade Lentil soup and it was delicious.  Quaint interior and piano player on certain days.  Service was excellent.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because it was near work. First I arrived 10 mins after they said my food would be ready and had to wait 15 mins for my food because the counter girl couldn't understand what I was saying. Asked for hot sauce and she said they didn't have any to go. She took my card to ring me out and than she walked away to get a table drinks. The food was cold, and tasted terrible. It smelled funny. Never again!"}
{"text":"Soooo.... Diners... There's just so many of them and they all serve the same food so it's ridiculously hard to be different. Unfortunately Kostas didn't stand out. That being said though, the food a good. Not mind blowing but good. They have some good specials for breakfast and lunch too."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The staff is friendly and the owner is always there with a smile on his face and a greeting as you enter. Plus, you will feast on generous portions with real flavor. In addition, if you have coffee with your meal you get a coffee to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great atmosphere.  The daily specials are always delicious! The servers are so friendly and accommodating. Will definitely be making this a go to for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Good for you Mike! Best wishes! If you would put half of the effort of your thoughts into the quality of your food and service you guys might just be alright! Keep up the good work bud I'm sure you'll go far!"}
{"text":"Great burger! The inside of the restaurant has cute decor and its immaculate. The only reason that it lost a star was because the service wasn't very good. Our server was missing much of the time. I would definitely go back though, they had a really good $3 breakfast special so I look forward to trying that."}
{"text":"If you like rude fast crap talking waitresses you can have this place. They push ya out your just a number.
Ordered veal cutlet it was pork not cool lucky I wasn't Muslim or jewish.....that's just wrong
Owner seemed like a skeemer...
See thru his fake Ness don't fall for it..he,knows how to play you....talks rude and down to his staff....low ball food pricing and you took the bait

Not impressed"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now so I'm ready to review Kosta and Vics. They're only open for breakfast and lunch which is a shame as I'd love to come more often. They have a very large menu and everything I've had thus far has been prepared perfectly and was very good. The service has been hit or miss depending on the server but the place is quite small so flagging them down is super easy. The tables are extremely close together so if you want to make new friends while enjoying a delicious breakfast this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast black Friday. Food was very good, served hot and fast by a friendly waitress. We all had the 1.99 special... 2 eggs 2toast and hashbrowns. Will be back!!"}

{"text":"Had Breakfast there twice. Two different \"Skillets.\" Everything fresh and tastes great. Real Corned Beef, not deli meat garbage. Good portions. Will definitely have to stop in for lunch one time. Way better than the place on York and 82."}
{"text":"Ordered potatoe pancakes & sent them back - terrible - looked like frozen hash browns loosely formed into a patty & tasteless!  No toilet tissue or paper towels in the ladies loo on this busy Valentine's Day morning.  Sidewalks snow covered & floor wet.  Service slow."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. I had a basic breakfast with 2 scrambled eggs, home fries and bacon. My husband had the Greek gyro skillet. Home fries on both of our meals were well undercooked, eggs cooked fine, bacon was crispy, but seemed precooked. 

The experience overall was interesting. Our waitress was polite. However the table of men presumably one was an owner were loudly discussing people's faces being smashed while we were trying to eat does not make for a pleasant dining experience. 

I don't believe we'll return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast spots in the area. The food is great, the service is wonderful, the place is clean. Family friendly and have a kids menu. You can get breakfast and lunch at the same time. They also offer carry out which is convenient. If you go on the weekends you may have a wait since this place is always packed but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast special with the purchase of a beverage. Looking forward to having lunch there soon."}
{"text":"I've been to Kosta and Vic's three times and I've been content each time.  I've had the same waitress every visit and she remembers my order and is very attentive, despite how busy the restaurant typically is.  Get the Irish Skillet."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out this morning for the first time, I ordered a side of potato pancakes and my boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash with home fries. I am a huge fan of potato pancakes and when I saw them I had high hopes because they were large and thick, however they were overly meaty for a potato pancake with no real added flavors like onions or garlic which I would expect. His dish wasn't bad, the corned beef hash was tasty but it did have a weird bite to it, almost like cumin or something, not spicy just different so I couldn't eat much. He enjoyed it, the cubed potatoes that came with were cooked okay again though nothing was added for flavor. I don't think I would return, however I have been told their sweet potato tater tots are good and I wish I would have tried them today because I doubt I'll go back just to try them."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and had a bad experience.  I ordered the potato pancake meal-Two eggs, sausage and substituted home fries with fruit (as the menu stated).  
-Eggs were overdone and dripping oil(butter would have been better, at least it has flavor)
-sausage, also greasy and no flavor.
-Potato pancakes, soggy and tasteless.
-Fruit, comical to say the least, they gave me a banana!!
I am always looking for new places to eat and happened to drive by and see the signs posted all over.  I'm not sure how the lunch is, but needless to say I will never know how the lunch is!"}
{"text":"Food was not as fresh as some.  But the price is really low (special with beverage)... So can't really complain."}
{"text":"A Total Rip-off

I took my 2 younng sons for lunch today.  They got chicken fingers and a side of mozzarella sticks.  The food was greasy, soggy, and luke warm.  The server could not have been anymore annoyed to be there than she was.  She was absolutely rude from start to finish.  The straw that broke the camel's back on this one was the kids' beverages.  We ordered white milk.  2 small, 3/4 glasses arrived.  They ordered a refill.  Each small glass of milk was $2.97 each!  I didn't catch this on the kids' menu nor did our pitiful excuse for a server point it out.  The food is microwave GFS at best.  The service is poor. Don't waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"Fast service, great food, fun environment. Exceptional time there. Always consistent, and tasting good."}
{"text":"If y'all like breakfast foods then you guys will love this place! They have a lot of variety so you are bound to find something you will love. The owner is super nice and is always walking around making sure that you are having a good time and have the best food and experience there."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say thank you for your kindness and great food.  Stopped by accident and had an amazing breakfast that was reasonably priced.  You made a bunch of jaded New Yorkers feel welcome."}
