{"text":"I heard about this place from a local TV show.   Understand that they operated in another location over 20 years ago before relocating to their current location.    They are a basic Hong Kong style cafe operation and have above average milk tea as a feature.   What makes this place extra special for me is the high % of  comfortable booth seating that give a sense of a bit more privacy.    The menu is relatively extensive for this kind of operation."}
{"text":"Food is alright,  tables are sticky and the whole hygienic of the place is downright ugly. Needs a refresh of makeover for sure."}
{"text":"Kam Fai is another Hong Kong Style Cafe in the Scarborough area where one can be stuffed full with food without paying a fortune.  Of course, they have breakfast/lunch/afternoon tea and all day specials.   Their breakfast sets are served from 8 AM - 2pm so basically you can have a brunch everyday :).  Lunch specials starts at $4.49 which includes a soup (I was served the Chinese soup without asking), entrees and drink. The Stired Fried Rice Noodle with Beef ($5.49) is huge! I just ate half of it and pack the other half to go. It is a little oily but I kind of expected it when I order this dish. It is a little blend tasting but not too bad.  The selections of items here are really good but mainly Cantonese dishes. Services is really fast so good place to come if you are in a rush!  They accepts Cash only!"}
