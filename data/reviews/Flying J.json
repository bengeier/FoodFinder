{"text":"I work in the area and avoid doing business here that requires me to go inside. Getting gas at the gas bar where I can pay at the pump is fine and sometimes they have good prices on gas. However Service inside I find chaotic, confusing and very slow, even when it appears to be not busy. Today I bought smokes I wanted to tell the clerk, \" What's with the attitude?\" I mean if you don't like your job please quit or Flying J, pay them better. I really felt he was bothered helping me. Many but not all associates I have delt with have little or no service skills and could try harder on being more friendly and intuitive to customers. I've had to many ugly experiences to give them my business any longer.."}
{"text":"There is a saying when one travels, when you need a place to eat then look for where the locals congregate.  For example in Mexico; the place to eat was always the busiest taco stand.  Here in Calgary go to where the truckers go, and so that is exactly what my friends and I did.

The Flying J Truck stop, and its restaurant \"The Country Market\" caters to the hard working distant driving trucker who wants a piece of sanity and delicious home cooking while on the road.  Here everything is made from scratch and is made in large trucker man portions to fill the appetite.  

The buffet is always a popular item, for  $15.99 you can get your pickings of  pizza, wings, fried chicken, chips etc.  I decided on the fish and chips platter, with one of the best side of coleslaws this Saskatchewan girl has ever tasted, my friend was enjoying her roast dip and the other two were getting down with their bottomless plate buffets.   

Coffee and pop is bottomless as well here but the piece de resistance is the home made banana cream pie, I will drive to this out of the city limits location just for the pie and you should too.

Fly down to the Flying J, for good food, atmosphere, always interesting conversation and if not for anything else but the affordable gas."}
{"text":"I was first acquainted with the Flying J as it is right next to my Fiance's office, and he bought us both a pair of aviator sunglasses here for our road trip.

Me: Where did you get these fantastic sun glasses? *cool pose in mirror*
Him: The Flying J
Me: Whaaaaaaaa? *look of confusion*
Him: it's a truck stop, they were only 15 bucks!
Me: *look of confusion continues*

So after finally visiting the Flying J, I discovered they have pretty much everything you could need to fuel up your semi, give birth in the backseat of a Prius, sugar coat your stomach lining or get a pretty decent lunch.

Their pizza is surprisingly good! You can also buy \"tech\" gear here, so if you are about to beat your husband cause he forgot to pack your bluetooth headset. HAVE NO FEAR. They sell them here.
But then you'll remember you look stupid with a bluetooth on people think you are schizophrenic when you talk to Cindy in the middle of an HMV, but that's another issue.

Gas up! Fuel up! Stock up!
