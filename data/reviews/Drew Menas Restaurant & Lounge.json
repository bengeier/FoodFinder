{"text":"Just a lil place that has great  Long islands. We have been here several times since our first visit at different times of day and have not been disappointed!!  Great food and wonderful waitresses!!! So I give it a great rating!!  Will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"It's a decent hangout. Outdated \"lounge\" but relaxed and a good place to grab a cheap beer."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves is smelling cigarette smoke while I'm eating and this was the main problem for me here. There are \"separate\" smoking and non-smoking areas but the place is so poorly ventilated that the smoke smell chokes you, even on the non-smoking side. Food was decent, I got an Italian hoagie and my husband got the chicken parm. Portions were huge, which was a plus, especially for the prices. With an added side of fries, our total bill was only $25. I would like to try other items on the menu but gagging on cigarette smoke will likely keep me away."}
{"text":"First time there and the last. Ordered the chicken cordon blu. Terrible. Looked like a baseball on my plate stuffed with some lunch meat and no swiss. Very dry. The waitress was rude. I told her that the chicken was dry and there was no swiss and got a dirty look and she walked away. Oh well so much for food that I heard was great. Definitely not"}
{"text":"They have a very good chicken parm, and their pasta is not bad at all.  I would get them both again.  Portion was excellent.

My Grandfather got their fish, and said it was very good.

We also had their French Onion Soup.  After reading the reviews, I still wanted to try it.  It was VERY good.  Does it need more broth, like others have said?  Yes.  But it is VERY GOOD, and I would get it again.  

As for the sirloin we tried, we probably would not get this again.  It was unseasoned, and just wasn't anything special.  

Fries?...eh.

Our garlic bread and breadsticks were hard and cold...I bet they would have been better if they were hot!

They had a great Pecan Ball for dessert, one of the better ones I have had.  Lots of good, generous toppings on it.  Pies were good, too.

Overall, i'd go back again and try something else."}
{"text":"Our previous 6 dinners there were great. Yesterdays sucked. I ordered a \"hot\" sausage sandwich and it was plain old sausage. My wifes' stuffed pork chop and mashed potatoes sucked."}
{"text":"I have seen a couple of bad reviews, I have gone here for lunch and really never had been disappointed. It's not a 4 star restaurant, however, if you want a good lunch I recommend it. I have had the chili, the fish sandwich, the bacon cheeseburger before and i have never been disappointed . I wouldn't say it's overwhelmingly great but I have not had a bad experience.

If they ask about the fresh cut fries or frozen, do the frozen. They do not know how to correctly cook the fresh cut. Once they were to greasy, the other time they were cook ok.
Service is a little slow, lunch service isn't to bad. Why the hell are their glasses so small?"}
{"text":"All dinner specials sold out by 6pm. 45 min wait until order was brought out. 
Food portions ok and tastes great."}
{"text":"Best prices and wings in town! My husband and I do not smoke. They have a separate side of the restaurant with no smoking. We love this place and probably go there at least 3 times a month. Pizza is great too!"}
{"text":"Plenty of unhealthy items and large portions on this menu.  We had some.

The huge chicken wings were pretty good actually.
The Turkey sandwich with cheese was just plain gross, it was basically a sandwich with a quart of Queso poured over it and microwaved.  

My large Gyro sandwich had a thin layer of soggy meat pushed against the pita, and A LOT of Lettuce

This is bar food, not restaurant quality at all."}
{"text":"This was one of my least favorite meals of all time. We ordered three appetizers: homemade chips, onion rings and potato skins. The only salvageable dish was the onion rings...the five we were given were pretty standard and at least edible. The potato skins were laughably awful; smothered by a large pile of tomatoes, and closer to mashed potatoes covered in nacho cheese than real potato skins. In Drew's defense, it did say cheese sauce (or something equally questionable) on the menu. Woof.

I had the french onion soup, which I believe is a daily soup. For this concoction, I want you to imagine three dozen croutons stuffed in a bowl and doused in a teaspoon of broth. It wasn't a bad tasting broth, but two separate people at my table thought it was lobster bisque because of its thickness.

My burger made a McDonald's single patty look like a 2lb burger. It was rail thin, overpowered by bun, and bland. The veggies seemed fresh enough, so maybe you can just eat those instead of the actual burger.

In case this horse hasn't been beaten enough, I will also point out that the service was trash. A member of my party tried to order a beer, and I guess the waitress had other plans. She said they didn't have a beer menu and then walked away, never to return. We were one of two tables, it wasn't like listing off the few beers on tap would have required a major effort.

Overall, terrible meal, not worth a second glance."}
{"text":"If I could I would give it a ZERO...two people in my party...not many people in the dining area...waited 5 mins to be told to sit where I want and when we went to sit at a table was told to go to a booth instead??? How is that sitting where I want...sat for 15 mins without even having our drink order taken...2 people came in 15 mins into our wait and was sat next to us and was asked immediately what they wanted to drink...but when the waitress came over with their drinks and started asking what they wanted to eat...I got up and walked out...passed two employees on the way out and nothing was said...20 mins and menus still open on the table...sorry not expectable and it makes me NEVER want to go back EVER"}
{"text":"Came for the \"homemade\" food. Ordered the stuffed cabbage and it was ok. The mashed potatoes are very obviously instant. Had the stuffed cabbage actually came to the table hot instead of refrigerator-cold inside then maybe I would have given them two stars. The 10-15 mins I had to wait for the waitress to come back so that I could ask to have my food warmed was not ok. Maybe the other restaurants I have been in set the bar too high? The waitress who waited on us only had one other table. I've seen better service from waitress who handle 5-7 at a time. I'm all about supporting a local business... But sorry I won't be back."}
