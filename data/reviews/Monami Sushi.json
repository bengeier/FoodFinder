{"text":"The tables are a little uncomfortable, but the food, service, and prices are great. They were also playing the Rick Mercer report, and gave us complimentary edamame because they were busy and we had to wait a little while. The second time I ordered from them was delivery, and someone actually called us about a half hour after it arrived to make sure everything was okay."}
{"text":"Can't say they've kept up the good work.  Prices went up, quality went down.  It's sad really."}
{"text":"Never have I been more disappointed in this place. If there was an option for zero stars, I would have selected it because this place is a waste of time. I believe they should teach these owners some customer service because clearly they lack that.

I have been a customer here for awhile and ordered plenty of times, in fact they even mentioned how much they remembered me. Well, you would think from people who remember your face, they would have a little bit of courtesy, no? Not these guys.

For one, I hate the hours. This place still refuses to put up a sign of their hours. Why? Not? I swear they are always changing them! They are never open, how on earth can this little shack run without hours? Is there something going on under the table?

I came later in the afternoon which it should have been open by now. Lights were on, TV was on and yet the door was locked. So I decided to give em a call, after no answer I decided to walk off when the chef opens the door and lets me in. I walk in and he tries to give me a menu when I simply tell him my order because it's always the same order. He mentions something I never heard of before, another combo or option. I said, \"No, the usual. What I always have. The pieces\" He nods in agreement and goes off to cook. I wait about 10-15 min or so and finally the order is done and I see all these containers. I was confused and asked what is that? He starts talking about salads and soups and shows me something I didn't even order!

I kindly explain that this order is incorrect and that this is not what I normally eat here. He claims he remembers me in which I reply, \"Is that so? Than you would know that I only ever order the same thing every time. This is not what I asked for.\" He threw a fit of sighs making a big deal out of it and than suddenly the other owner comes along. The lady and starts just yelling at me like crazy. Not only was I startled by how she approached me so threateningly but yelling at me claiming the chef is right? How would she know? The door was shut and she wasn't even present when I know very well what order I made. It is not my fault he wasn't listening. 

She continued to yell at me in which I was upset and fed up of hearing her and cut her off completely. The chef would not budge and so I had to pay for something I obviously didn't like nor wanted to eat. He claimed he made a big discount for me. From 12 dollars to 11. WOW. BIG DISCOUNT. How about making it free because YOU messed up. Or even better, make me what I actually asked for!?

These people need to learn proper customer service. No matter what business you are in, the customer is always right and you as a good business owner have to fix the problem in order to keep your customers. Apparently these guys didn't take enough classes.

Well you lost a very loyal customer because as soon as I stepped out that door I knew I was never coming back. Not spending a single penny in that worthless joint. 

You said your miso soup was the best? I fed it to my flowers. It had no taste what so ever. Also, what the heck was that salad all about? The salad was ROTTEN. The leaves looked absolutely  expired. I lost my appetite and threw everything in the garbage.

I wouldn't recommend this place guys, the food just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"We live in the area so were thrilled to finally have a sushi joint within walking distance. The first year or so, the quality was decent for take-out/delivery sushi (we never dined in as we prefer to eat in the comfort of our own home). Portions were good prices reasonable & quality was consistent. The owner was always courteous, friendly; got to know us so service was great. I'd have given them four stars. We'd order from them every week.
Then it appears they changed ownership which was evidenced by the different staff, inconsistent execution from one week to the next, sloppy presentation, rolls that don't remain intact for long, skimping on portions & lower quality ingredients. Things continued to go downhill with no signs of improvement. We made a tough decision to no longer patronize this business in Spring 2013. We couldn't justify spending any more money on them even though we try to support our neighbourhood businesses as frequently as we can.
If their quality improves I might give them one more chance."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  the food id so good, and at a great price!!  The customer service is phenomenal, every time.  The delivery is polite and friendly, and they even call to follow up and ensure your meal is as you like.  Can't say enough good things about this place!  I highly recommend giving it a try - you won't be disappointed.  Try the spicy makimono set!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great clean bright and quiet gem and hopefully will be the first of a new wave of yummy and cool spots where local residents who are eager to spend their local dollars can go for great food and service."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place and I find it incredibly difficult to get food from here because this shop is rarely open. I moved in 2 months ago and I'm shocked to see how frequently this place is not open. I was lucky enough to get an order in once in the past 2 months because of this. Right now as I'm posting this I was waiting until 1600 when they would open to place an order as we were all craving sushi and when it rolled around to 1630 they were still not open (however their open sign was lit up and still is). We had made an attempt to call or use the justeat website in case they were just doing deliveries and that too said it was closed which is contradicting their website's hours! I have already made a quick decision not to go back there as it is such a gamble on their hours of operation. 

Since I'm reviewing their shop I will have to say the spicy makimono was pretty decent but could have had more flavor (was smooth and crunchy where it needed to be). 

Their website advertises

{"text":"Delighted by this cosy and unpretentious neighborhood sushi joint! The vegetarian options were plump, tasty and satisfying, with generous helpings of gari and wasabi.  Crisp and succulent dumplings, too."}
{"text":"This place is such a disappointment, they're NEVER open! I just moved to the area and I've gone here a few times during their advertised hours of operation and they've never been open...ever! They're supposed to be open right now, open sign is on and everything...door is locked.
The owner shouldn't be commenting on peoples bad reviews saying that he disagrees with their bad reviews and they have great customer service when they're not even open during their own hours of operation to have any customer service skills to show. No wonder there are never any customers in there, who would travel to come here for food when they don't know if they're ever open or not."}
{"text":"Found this place on JustEat.ca, but their site was malfunctioning so we called the store to order directly.

The sushi is good, but what really stood out was the customer service. About 20 minutes after we'd received our food, they called to check up on us and ask how it was. Who does that these days?! Also the guy that delivered our food was the nicest delivery person I've ever encountered, he said we were neighbours (the restaurant is very close to us) and encouraged us to drop by anytime.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this spot. I suppose I had really high hopes. They were really great for some things, and mediocre in others. 

The fish was good, but the rice was undercooked. I really enjoyed the spicy salmon handroll, but everything else was just okay. We ate in, and there was a TON of takeout orders and it seems that most people were repeat customers. The atmosphere is very very casual. 

Service was very friendly. But one of our dishes came out quite a bit after the others did.

I might drop by again for a takeout order if I'm craving sushi and don't want to go very far."}
{"text":"Every bite of their food is filled with yum and passion! I loved stumbling onto this place, and I love being a frequent flyer! Justin and Fiona are just as loyal to their customers as they are to their food! What are you waiting for, run and try their Double Salmon Roll! Oh and they have a new menu too!"}
{"text":"This place is over priced compared to what else is available close by like on Eglinton West. I finally saw a special posted that was priced to be justifiable. It was a spicy california roll, vegetable roll, soup, and salad. Soup and salad were normal. The rolls were very small. Not acceptable. The soy sauce is diluted. Apparently some people like to dip their sushi in water. I don't get it. This is a really small place so it's hard to have any sort of atmosphere. Finally, when I went to pay I advised the cashier that I would pay by debit. She was quick to inform me that cash is better. Personally I'm of the opinion that if you don't want to accept debit you shouldn't make the option available. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I order takeout from here all the time and their veggie options are delicious! I'm always impressed by the presentation on the takeout orders and they are always polite when I go in to pickup. As a takeout place, 5 stars, but because they are also set up for eat-in it gets lowered to four because the eat-in space has a lot of room for improvement (tables, chairs, decor, etc.)."}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's above average in the sushi realm but not by much. It's a great addition to the neighbourhood and I have done some take out after a long day at work but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. If you're in the area though it's great to finally have some sushi to take home that's only a short walk. I think they have room to up their game both in quality of food and customer service. All in all if you need to satisfy your sushi craving and it's convenient for you go for Monami."}
{"text":"All these 5-star reviews for a neighbourhood that rarely gets any action on Yelp, hm.

Well, these reviews finally forced me to go here. I ordered the Roll Combo for lunch, which included tempura and a small bowl of miso

The rolls looked wonderful and had a strong presence inside, with a very thin layer of rice, point! The tempura was a nice mixture of yams, avacado and even a large piece of shrimp, hooray! The miso was miso, which is the same everywhere, but always delightful.

For just over $10, it was a pleasant lunch and I'll have to come back to try a few more of their options. Regardless, this little spot is a welcome addition to a 'hood that struggles with closed-up windows and uninviting bars."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service. I waited over an hour (well past the estimated delivery time) and when I called to check on the status they said that its not made it yet and it would be at least another half hour. They didn't offer a discount on this order or a future order. They told me to just cancel my order..DONE!! Wont order here again."}
