{"text":"Great spot, with a limited but good menu.  Very hidden, but somehow I have found this place 2 times by accident...so maybe the placement is genius...  Anyhow good beer selection, and great staff."}
{"text":"Excellent! A must visit if I'm downtown Cleveland, wonderful atmosphere, phenomenal food, great beer and hand crafted cocktails.  Service was great, favorite new Cleveland bar."}
{"text":"Can't get enough!  My husband and I have dined at the a Bar and Kitchen 4 times, and will definitely be back again!  The salmon is outstanding.  Expertly cooked and full of flavor!  You can't go wrong with the burger, A Bar steak, or chicken either!  Gotta have dessert too!  The lemon meringue pie served during restaurant week was delightfully light and fluffy with a pastry crust!  Authentic original and praline cheese cakes are yummy too and the warm chocolate molten cake and bread pudding are also a great endings!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for the weekend and was looking for a good place to get dinner close to my hotel. It was a convenient location and we didn't wait at all; in fact, it was pretty dead for a Saturday night. I feel like they definitely deserve more people going there! My food was excellent. The tots were some of the most amazing bar food I have ever had and my burger (the CLE burger) was great. My companion had the chili, which was also very good, and the chicken skewers, which were a big misfire. They had a strange texture and taste and the sauce was strangely tasteless. I would have given 5 stars if it hadn't been for the skewers. The ambiance could also be improved. It was a little too brightly lit for a night spot/dinner. It is definitely worth checking this place out; it seems like they need some more customers."}
{"text":"On Sunday 11/13 my husband & I drove downtown from Berea to eat here. The windows were boarded up with paper and an tiny little sign that said, closed for cleaning. You can imagine our anger.  Pretty sure I'm not going to attempt this again."}
{"text":"Best burgers & food for a reasonable price near Quicken Loans Arena. If you need to grub before you watch King James ball out then come here. The food is so dank & it's EXTREMELY pricy. Their stuffed burger is GOAT."}
{"text":"The good... Clean layout,  friendly staff. A few arcade games for the kids. Wife and I had the 8th Street Chicken sandwich which was pretty ok. The strawberry salad was very tasty. 

The bad... Kids each had the pulled pork. Usually a go-to for them. Neither of them ate much of it. I sampled it and agreed, it tasted burnt. Got a side of house BBQ sauce which tasted even more burnt. Also,  the men's room was dirty and had a ceiling tile in the trash. 

Next time in Cleveland, this will not be a \"redo\"."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon A Bar while visiting Cleveland. Even though it was tough to find, the food and atmosphere was great. The charcuterie board was incredible with the mustard aolie. The cured salmon was delicious as well. This is a big place that was beautiful on the inside."}
{"text":"Can you say Cleveland's best kept secret??? What a great find for a very late night snack! Fresh, made to order food. No frozen and fried crappy bar food here. Just de-lish sandwiches, fries and more. Walk on past everything else and walk in to this great atmosphere and welcoming staff!  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Slightly difficult to find -- look for the signs on the alley off Euclid Ave -- but worth the extra effort.  This was a very nice surprise and worth the extra effort.

Food was very good, much better than typical bar food, with upscale ingredients and nice presentation.  Prices were very fair for the portions & quality received.  Had the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese & apricot, with saffron risotto and swiss chard on the side.  M had the portobello burger with house made chips.  Chicken was very tasty, served in three smaller pieces breaded & deep fried.  Probably not the healthiest meal I had that week, but combining it with the swiss chard at least took some of the guilt away!  For some reason, I had expected it grilled, but no matter, it was quite rich and very filling.

Drink selection was what you would expect from a bar.  We enjoyed a nice tropical concoction in an appropriate shade of electric blue.  All in all, very fun and enjoyable.  We wished we were in town longer to explore more of the menu on future visits."}
{"text":"Worst experience I had with a restaurant. We arrived at 10pm and we were handed menus by the waiter and the bartender came over stating that our menus were wrong and handed us menus that were 11pm-close mean while we were there before 11. It just seemed as if they were to lazy to make food that wasn't on the bar menu. I asked for a salad and the salad was so sorry. I've had salad from the grocery store bag better then what they gave me. 

I will never return here. This is only half of what my party and I experienced"}
{"text":"We stopped here for  lunch.  Food is well prepared, creative and delicious. Beer list is excellent. Did not get a chance to try the house made cocktails but would love to next time we are in Cleveland. We liked this place so much we had our team dinner here. The staff was so hospitable and made us feel quite welcome.   Food was delicious. Service was excellent. Beer is very good. Very good value for the price too.  Thanks to Carl and his server partner for a great time."}
{"text":"Great place to go, especially if you can't afford to wait over an hour that some of the more popular places in the neighborhood now require on weekends or Cavs/Indians nights.  As it is a newer place, it's still a small crowd, and you have the luxury of picking your table, whether you want to be by the bar/TVs, etc.  I came back 2 times later in addition to my first time coming in March.  Cheap prices for pretty good bar/americana type food!  The fried chicken sandwich was AMAZING, and I haven't ventured to try another entree since.  Give these guys a shot- great food for cheap price, and like I said, if you're in a rush to catch Kyrie/Lebron or the Tribe, you can't beat the location for a quick snack and a few drinks"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service I've EVER witnessed in my entire life! Incompetent servers... Incompetent management! Waited over 90 minutes for dinner. Food was good but service was HORRIFIC! Never going back."}
{"text":"Don't let the back alley location deter you.  Great burgers and craft beer selection!"}
{"text":"For only being open a few months they're killing it. The bar staff and owner are super knowledgeable about their beer and very friendly. 
Its clean, has a great vibe and good music playing at a level you can enjoy while still holding conversation.
Had the Scotch Eggs and their homemade Tats with Chipotle Catchup, both were fantastic. 
Not many restaurants or bars I'll hang out at for 3-4 hours but it was easy to do here."}
{"text":"50 minutes is how long it took to get my very first drink. And that was after getting up to grab my own glass of water 10 minutes prior.  My food took one hour and 25 minutes before it arrived. When my food arrived, the accompanying side dish wasn't even the one I ordered.

There seemed to be a complete absence of any managers or owners who were overseeing the place. Shame on the owner or manager because you would have noticed there was a problem if you were doing your job.  This is YOUR fault!  No one else's.  If you are the owner, sell the business to someone who cares. If you are the manager, I hope the owner tells you to seek employment elsewhere.

The few good things were that the food was excellent (and hot in spite of the delay).  Carl, whom I don't even think was our waiter, was very attentive when he realized on his own that there was a problem at our table. (We never complained, however). And our waitress was very sweet and very apologetic (although not very attentive during the course of the evening)."}
{"text":"Went here before a cavs game. Wait staff is super friendly and great personalities but they seem to be understaffed on waiters, leading to slow service. I only received my bottle beer towards the end of my meal. The menu itself looks really amazing, but food was mediocre. Burger was overly greasy. I also watched Kitchen Nightmares before we went out so I may have just channeled my inner Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"Had hangover fries, a pulled pork sandwich, and jerk pasta with my sister. They were all AMAZING!!! My only complaint is that the waiter tries to get you to add or change sides to your order that they charge for.... I was also charged for a side of bbq sauce. Strange."}
{"text":"Great place, had the jerked  pasta was very good,  also the chicken skewers were also good."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out because it was close to our hotel. As many reviews have stated, the zucchini appetizer was delicious. My husband also ordered the wings and said the bourbon bbq sauce was good. I ordered the mac and cheese. It was tasty, but definitely saltier than I would prefer. We were there through a couple of different happy hours. The best deal is 8-9PM when tap beer (including Oberon--a fave of ours) was $2. The evening we were there (a Tuesday) it was dead, but it seemed like a nice place and we would go back again if we were in town."}
{"text":"Very nice place!!! Delicious food and a good selection. Not what you would expect walking in. Good price too. Service is a bit shakey."}
{"text":"I ate at A Bar and Kitchen during a lull before the Cavaliers game and went away happy. We were served by one of the bartenders and he had a good grasp of the menu. I had the Pan Seared Salmon and it was done just right! The cannelli ragu made the dish and the salmon tasted fresh. I will return to this restaurant during my next visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my family while in town and was very impressed! Great food with a great selection.. Good range of beers n drinks.. and really nice people running the place. This is a new joint in town that deserves to last a long time.  So give it a try.. We are glad we did."}
{"text":"Tough to happen across this place being that its located in an alleyway, but you should seek it out.  Great food, huge place, billiards/bar bowling/pinball, looks clean and classy.  I'm hoping it does well enough to stick around since previous owners seemed to come and go ever few years (I'm guessing it mostly had to do with location)."}
{"text":"Good overall experience. Nice decor & unique food. Fun place for out-of-towners!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great new place in downtown Cleveland.  Here on a Sunday afternoon and - giving them an A+ on service, food quality and their awesome Bloody Mary Bar!!!  
Excellent value as well!!   Very reasonable.   Unique menu too!!!

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service!!!! Read great reviews online so my cousin and I decided to stop by and give it a try. We walked into an empty restaurant, so we walked near the back and what appeared to be the only staff member was not very pleasant. I asked her if they were open and after she balled up her face she said \"Yea, sit where you want\". I went to the ladies room and my cousin went to the bar where she asked what was good to try. She was told the restaurant \"was not famous for anything, but she could review the menu\"....not really A 1 service as expected. Maybe this isn't even the type of service that is the norm, but luckily for the owner we are not secret shoppers. Hopefully management takes note....would have loved to have a better experience :("}
{"text":"Good quality price ratio. Bar man was nice. Homemade and local ingredients all over the menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but it failed me. First of all, the food isn't seasoned well. Sure there's many deep fried options that would please people who just look for typical bar foods, but nothing stood out to me except for the tots with stuffed cheese. The waffle and chicken is a dry and bland dish, the syrup helped a bit but not impressive. The drinks are lackluster and the bartender talked back to a customer who didn't like his drink, in a rude and arrogant manner that is. If your food and drinks aren't exceptional, you need to have the SERVICE to make up for it. But this isn't the case."}
{"text":"Appetizers: potato crisps were excellent, zucchini fries are meh. Good, stiff mixed drinks, beer is good. Calamari, stuffed burger (with three different types of cheeses) and stuffed chicken were great. The Brussels sprouts were a little overdone. The hangover fries is enough to feed a small army. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The 8th Street Chicken sandwich was amazing!! Definitely want to go back and try the Chicken Paprikash soup and the Portabello Sandwich which other people in my party got and looked equally as good! Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Not sure why more people don't come here, but don't be put off when you don't see the place packed.  I come here somewhat often since I live close, so felt the need to drum up some support for this underrated spot.  The people who work here are great, the food is a MAJOR notch above other places I think it competes with (Clevelander, Paninis, Winking Lizard, etc), and they run awesome drink specials.  If you are headed to one of those old stand-bys, at least give A Bar a try. It'll be worth your time."}
{"text":"Food was good but going through obvious growing pains as a new place. Service was terrible.  Well give it another try in a couple months cuz the place has potential."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food! Came in late and the bartender was friendly and did not rush us.  Food was hot and really great tasting...and tasted homemade...great place."}
{"text":"Had dinner at around 9pm not many people just around 4 tables and yet food arrived 45 minutes! I ordered a stuffed burger but ended up being served a bar burger.  I was just so hungry that I didn't bother to change my order. Food was ordinary.  Beers were better."}
{"text":"Another Fabulous Restaurant: Cue the Crowds

I found the restaurant easily and with no troubles with my gps and once I entered the first thought that hit me is this restaurant is gigantic....It comes as a surprise, because from the outside you would think it's much smaller than it actually is, but it's an extremely pleasant place to dine and for it to be a bar, it is definitely possible for a group to have a conversation as if their in a private home.

The owners and their staff are cooking and serving excellent food at that's bold and honest. This is definitely a place you need to visit. The A Bar and Kitchen is quickly making a name for itself and is a happy balance between party time at dinner time, and high quality EATS. 

My fellow yelper and I didn't expect this place to be so good and yet so unassuming. But this place is nothing more than excellence. I really hope the prices don't change and the service doesn't become lack luster as the attention grows with this place, because I knew after the first bite that I was hooked and will definitely be a regular. 

I ordered the jerk chicken pasta with a side caesar salad and it honestly was hands and paws down nothing short of perfect. The Chef/Owner brought my plate halfway to the bar and decided to take it back to make some fresh croutons and I couldn't have been happier. It showed me the care for great customer service and attention to small details, because honestly it was some of the best croutons i've had. The owner told me they take leftover bread, which could be any kind to make the croutons, and mine were rye which was to die for and some plain,and pumpernickel. It was seasoned so nicely. The cesar dressing....oMg!!! It had a hint of spice to it really made me want to run my finger across the plate for the remaining sauce. 

The jerk chicken pasta blew my mind, the bartender told me it was the Chef's families private recipe and boy do they have a hit. I paid 12 bucks for an amazing salad and pasta and the portion size was nice and their was a good amount of chicken, which made it perfect. I took home extra and couldn't even wait to eat it the next day.  1 day later and i'm headed to go back to get me some dinner to go, so yeah that sums up my experience:)"}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon. Ordered grilled bbq wings which were great. Spinach salad which was good and pulled pork. Also good. Decent atmosphere. Nice service."}
{"text":"Average at best. They did ok at the food you can't easily mess up - pasta smothered in creamy sauce, chicken fingers, tater tots. Ordered vegetables on the side and they were terrible and bland. The beer and bourbon selections were also disappointing."}
{"text":"Fast service and mellow atmosphere. I stuck to the right hand side of the menu. Items were about $9. We did have some undercooked burgers...raw..that they were willing to re-cook for us."}
{"text":"Reuben is the bomb. Had Niki as a server she was attentive and nice. Since it was my first time here all the staff was friendly and helpful. Great place to have meetings downtown over lunch! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a night when the Indians were in town. Nice out of the way place. I had the lamb burger which was great. Also try the chicharonnes they are great. Fiancé had the stuffed burger which was equally tasty. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. Surprised to see it was so empty on a Saturday night, but it's hard to see from the road (it's on the side of the CVS). Definitely worth going back to."}
{"text":"WOW! What an improvement! 

I've been here a few times, two of which were only for a quick drink. Definitely a good place for just stopping by the bar and having a beer. The bar staff was a little awkward and stared a lot the second time, but other than that, no problems. At least I got served (cough, Black Dog, cough). 

The food is also pretty tasty. A friend and I split some bites including the chicken skewers and mussels. Both were good, nothing wrong.

The only reason I'm at a 3 is because there's nothing spectacular about this place. Maybe if I try a full meal here or just go more I'll find reason for another star or two, but overall, it's just average."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious and our waiter was really nice but it took forever to get drinks from the bar. Sitting in the area of the bar you could see them just standing around talking and texting in their phones. When you go out to eat and want have a couple of beers it's hard when you wait 15 minutes for one after you order. Wouldn't go back again for that reason."}
{"text":"Save the trip. Horrible servers. One is currently dressed like she's the head madame at a brothel and one looks like she runs a cycling class and just rolled out of bed. We sent back 2 entrees! I purchased a Groupon and I will be calling them back for a FULL REFUND FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. Oh yeah...the owner is one rude dude."}
{"text":"Hard to find (in the alley between Euclid and Prospect) but the food was delicious. Portobello burger was excellent and the French fries are fresh cut and very good. 

Good post baseball or basketball game spot. Was not that crowded on Saturday night."}
{"text":"We had the calamari which was a little floury and spicy for me but the tater tots we ordered were so yummy! Not to mention they have a good happy hour and are right down the street from the Indians and Cavs! Overall a solid place to checkout before the game"}
{"text":"In town for Home & Remodeling show & picked this restaurant based on great Yelp reviews. We visited early evening the day of NCAA basketball game & they were well-staffed and ready for business. We ordered the charcuterie board for an appetizer, bar burger & fries, and steak salad plus 2 PBR and 2 glasses of wine. Our choice of the charcuterie board was partially based on photos on Yelp; unfortunately our board looked nothing like the pictures - it didn't have robust shavings of cheese, rather its cheese selection consisted of micro kernels. My friend's burger was not medium as ordered, but completely bloody rare and my steak salad had no cheese and a fatty piece of steak. Unfortunately, our server never returned to our table to check on our meals, or take an additional drink order. She appeared to only have 2 other tables and she wasn't overly busy. The other restaurant patrons appeared to be from out-of-town for the basketball tourney. We left disappointed, still hungry and feeling as if we had paid money for nothing. I think if the server had done a meal check, my friend could have least reordered a non-rare burger."}
{"text":"I found it strange that I couldn't find one burger centric restaurant in downtown Cleveland. Granted, I live in Cincinnati, which had only obtained two burger restaurants in the past month. Yes, I checked the Yelp app. The closest place that had burgers was Flipside on Front Street. While Sammi and I enjoy walking (gotta get those steps in!), we had already walked from our hotel, over to Playhouse Square, and up to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Lake Erie. We did NOT want to walk another mile out of our way, and instead decided to walk back to the Gateway District. We walked back and looked at Hodges, which was the first place that popped up on the app, but for some reason only offered one burger? We decided on A Bar and Kitchen, which is located in a little alleyway by our hotel. It was quite a find.

We walked in apprehensively but were greeted by a homey little restaurant and bar that had a makeshift arcade in the back. The music was diverse and calming and the seating was well set up. Carl sat us down, and he was the real star of the show. Half host half waiter, he was attentive, upbeat and charismatic. He apologized for taking a little longer with getting our orders taken because he likes to ensure that each table is taken care of completely. No complaints here on that! He took our drink and food orders. Sammi got a Bud Lite and I decided on the 2XMAS from Southern Tier. I was excited that they still had it, but my conscious voice knew that it would be flat because it's February. Alas it was, but Carl was so gracious about getting me a different beer - the Great Lakes Conway's Irish Ale, which was surprisingly delicious.

Our food came shortly after our drinks; Sammi had the stuffed burger while I opted for the the salmon BLT. Sammi enjoyed her burger immensely; I mean, it's a burger stuffed with cheese, how could it not be good? I'm sure native Minneapolians would agree. My salmon BLT was different than what I was expecting - I don't know if it was the pecan flavored bacon, or the dijon aioli, but the flavors didn't mesh as well as I expected them to. It was all good though, because I enjoy the flavors separately so I could eat it. The fries that I ordered with them were fantastic; perfectly salted, hot and fresh.

All in all, a very enjoyable experience. Carl was fantastic from start to end and my complaints about the food was minuscule. I would recommend a visit the next time you're in CLE."}
{"text":"Okay Yelpers, WTF?  Do all of you really think this place is all that? Shame.
I went because of your reviews, the proximity to my hotel, and the happy hour.  
I luckily happened to look over my shoulder to find the sign of this place.  It is on a side street.  There was a baseball game tonight so I thought there would be people in this establishment.  When I arrived at 620, there were 8 people in the joint.  
Overall, the environment is unpretentious; tables and chairs with a few slightly smaller then average TVs. Nothing special.
I sat at the bar and was welcomed by a soft spoken tender.  She explained the happy hour and menu.  I ordered a specialty cocktail since they are on happy hour prices.  Took a sip through the straw and noticed that there was lipstick on my glass.  They graciously remade my drink.  The cocktails were good. I was not charged for the first drink.
I had the Tator tots app;  freshly shredded potatoes, cheeses and bacon with chipotle ketchup.  When served, it was 9tots;enough to share.  But there was no distinct taste of any ingredient except potato.  The ketchup was Heinz with chipotle sauce added. And there was this yellowish-green crumble sprinkled on the plate(really never figured out what the hell it was).
A couple more people came in; staff was attentive.
The menu has a diverse selection but nothing says \"I want that\".  I ordered the Duroc pork chop entree.  The bartender asked how I wanted it cooked and told him 145F. Which he said well?  I told him just cooked medium as all pork is accepted.
He asked me which salad I would like; which surprised me because it is not stated on the menu that you get a salad with your entree.  He offered a house or Caesar; asked what the house salad was and told me that it is Iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots and tomatoes.  Sort of stunned me.  Noting else?  A house salad represents the kitchen; a unique touch to a salad.  I figured he forgot the ingredients and Ordered the house salad.  Nope!  It really was chopped iceberg with 2 slices of cucumbers and 2 wedges of tomatoes.  Really?
My entree took over 15 minutes to arrive after my salad.  I substituted brussels  sprouts for the green beans on the entree.  When served, I was told since I subbed, they did not want the brussels'  sauce and pork sauce to combine.  Nice thought.
My medium temp ordered pork was well done; no sign of pink, all gray; nice way of killing a Duroc chop.  The sauce was no sauce or glaze but a watery consistency of maple syrup.  The quinoa was hot but had the consistency of coarse ground grits.  The brussels sprouts were perfectly prepared but needed  a small amount of salt.

All the time while sitting at the bar, both tenders were inattentive unless spoken to.  The one women tender only spoke to her friend and I think it was her first day.  She did not even had a bottle opener on her.  The gent behind the bar was slightly pretentious, made a good cocktail, but did his own thing.
This place won't make it.  Customers expect a performance when dining;  this place misses big time.  No management was even seen.  I walked out and was not even acknowledged or thanked."}
{"text":"Where to start.......

There were some good things, but there were more bad things about my visit to A Bar and Kitchen.

First the good.  The zucchini fries were delish!  They had a great breading and were fried perfectly.  The zucchini itself was still nice and crunchy, too.  These are definitely the reason I'm not giving a lone single star.  We also had the mac and cheese.  These were also good, but were a little on the greasy/oily side.  The pasta was cooked well, and the flavor was good though.

Now for the not-so-good.  For my entree I had the jerk pasta.  This had all kinds of no written on it.  The flavor and consistency was reminiscent of the pre-portioned & microwaved food one would expect from a place like TGIFriday's & the like.  The chicken was clearly a pre-sliced & from frozen package from GFS (I buy it for use at home) and aside from the rather bland sauce the only other thing in it was julienned peppers which I also suspect were from a bag kept in a freezer.  

My girlfriend had their veggie patties.  Mushy, flavorless, and sad.  That is what we thought of this dish.  Aside from the taste of garlic there wasn't much else to say about this except to avoid it.

As were were walking around downtown we saw how busy many of the other restaurants were, and should have probably taken lack of customers as a sign of we were about to get ourselves into. We walked out knowing that we would never go back again."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our dinner here Friday night!

The place: very clean, sharp looking, well taken care of. Cool Ohio stamped into the floor in the bar area. It was pretty dead there. The place has a decent beer selection with a range of micro brews available, and more in bottles. Menu looked like a good selection. We used a groupon - free $8, why not!?

Pros: The waiter was super friendly, in fact, I've never gotten to know a waiter so well in my life! He did a great job attending to the table. 
I had a cheeseburger and fries, which was very flavorful and actually cooked correctly! Juicy and delicious. Friends were fantastic hand cut fries. He had the mac and cheese with chicken. Now, I'm a M&C snob, and I make a fantastic dish, but this one - was the best mac and cheese I've had at a restaurant. Ever. (I still like mine better).   $40, for 4 beers and two meals, is super cheap!  Next time we will make sure to get there during happy hour - $2 beers. 

The cons: it took forever to get our food, as dead as the place was. But, we weren't in any hurry, so we didn't care whatsoever. But if we needed to be in and out, it was pretty slow. 

So, it was a great little find, definitely will be returning. There's two pool tables, a bowling game, and a couple arcade games. They need dart boards - idk why Ohio doesn't have darts!!?!"}
{"text":"Updating this review and sadly docking them a star. I hate to do it, but I came hungry and left disappointed. The happy hour was still great- one of the best downtown. But the food, so lackluster. We were looking for a few quick snacks so we ordered the wings, the green beans, and a side of brussel sprouts. This was the second time we had the wings and they were still delicious. The green beans were lacking any type of flavor, I could make better at home. And the brussel sprouts, ohhh those poor brussel sprouts. To preface, if you think brussel sprouts are gross, please buy fresh ones and roast them because they are perfection. But if your menu says roasted sprouts with caramelized onions and bacon, my expectations are high. Instead we received these poor wilted boiled sprouts, in a sea of butter, no bacon to be seen. We didn't even eat them, it was sad. 
I will come back, partly because they have a great happy hour and partly because it is so conveniently located to my work/apartment, but I'm not confident in trying the food again. I might stick with drinks, and I might recommend you to do the same."}
{"text":"Great service and great drinks. Anthony was out waiter/bartender. He was great with explaining the menu and telling us the history behind the restaurant. Food was amazing everything is made in house and the fries are marinated in beer, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Met Steve the owner on our trip from Florida. GREAT GUY...Great food, the wings and the Ruben where some of the best I have had. Great atmosphere and old time Cleveland oils on the wall. GREAT place to go before or after a ball game!!"}
{"text":"It's decent food for a decent price. Nothing spectacular. I was a little disappointed when I ordered the Hangover Fries and they came smothered in beans. I wish they had pointed that out on the menu because I definitely wouldn't have ordered it if that was the case. I usually go for the 8th street chicken sandwich which is typically very good."}
{"text":"We took 3 teenagers here and all had very good meals. My daughter wanted a plain burger and they made it no problem and was delicious. The cheese planks were a great appetizer, I had steak salad and it was light on the steak but otherwise very good. Our party also got the wings, stuffed burger, Ruben and skewers and all were excellent."}
{"text":"After being bookmarked for a couple of months, I finally made it out to A Bar and Kitchen, located downtown, which I approve of and love how Cleveland continues to expand.


Our waitress (cannot remember her name unfortunately) was such a nice girl, full of energy and enthusiastic. We're off to a good start! My friend and I decide on the lamb burger with zucchini fries, and the macaroni and cheese. Ordering lamb was risky, but a great test, because if you can cook lamb right, that says a lot. Well I'll tell you this was some of the best tasting lamb I've had in a long time. I was very impressed and satisfied. It was perfectly cooked and it was just so simple, but it works that way. My friend also loved it. The zucchini fries for me were a miss. They were too oily and quite nauseating, so I only had one. The macaroni and cheese was deeeeelicious! Cheesy, yummy, and filling. 

For dessert we had the chocolate molten cake which had a good center but the cake itself had to have been sitting around for a few days if not more. It was stale and had that old taste to it. Yuckhhhhh! 

Recommendations: LAMB BURGER, LAMB, LAMB, LAMBBBBBB!"}
{"text":"my husband and i came to cleveland for the nba finals and found a bar and kitchen on yelp. we sat at the bar and taylor was AWESOME. he came up with some gin cocktails using an all-natural strawberry purée that he just made... delicious!! he also told us some other places to check out in the city, really helpful, nice dude. 

had the calamari and tots to start. both were tasty and came with really good marinara, mustard aioli, and chipotle which were all made in-house. we also shared the stuffed burger, and added onion straws,
SO GOOD! fries were great too. chef even came out to say hi. 

dope place with great food! wish we were in town longer so we could
go back!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on a Wednesday night after the Rock and Roll HOF, with my wife and 2 yr old. We were one of the few tables in the place by 8:30PM. I ordered the stuffed chicken, stuffed with goat cheese and apricot, served with cheesy risotto, and a Caesar salad; and I couldn't resist ordering the mac'n'cheese w/ chorizo. My wife ordered the burger stuffed with corned beef and some zucchini fries. Unfortunately, even though it was dead in there, and our waiter was super attentive and friendly, the food all came out of the kitchen at the same time. 
The first thing I noticed was the portion sizes were huge. I knew immediately we'd be boxing up half our food and taking it back to the hotel. 
The salad was nothing special, good and huge, but nothing unique about it. The chicken was delicious, I couldn't tell if was hand made or frozen, but it was so good it didn't matter. Risotto was a little chewy, but I had so much food in front of me I just ignored it. 
The mac'n'cheese was better than I'd expected and I would highly recommend it all by itself."}
{"text":"I am really rooting for these guys. We went for dinner. And we were the only ones there for dinner. But it was a Tuesday and the weather has been less than desirable this winter. 

The menu looks great - I found it in the lobby of my building. Ordered the Veggie Cakes and they were seriously delicious. The whole plate was. I would get it again but I would explore the menu a bit more first. My other half got a burger and up-charged to fries vs the house chips it normally comes with. They were served with a malt vinegar aioli that he could have chugged out of the bottle (aka amazing).

Growing pains to point out. I think the up-charge for fries - $3 - may be high. The menu says it's for the hangover fries. Misprint. That up-charge would be $7. Or server was nice an told us of the faux pas. Miller Lite is spelled wrong both on the menu and on the website. And their dipping sauces should be portioned with the container. We both got half or what should be in the given container. Just my personal condiment opinion.

Their happy hour looks great and so do the variety of other food choices. I'll be back and wishing them the best of luck!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem - great food and great service! Recommend pulled pork sandwich and veggie cakes. Large selection of craft beers and drinks"}
{"text":"What a great place! It's a little difficult to find, but it's such a cute and trendy place. Our waitress, Silver, was fantastic! Our cocktails were delicious and the food exceeded our expectations. My friend's steak was huge, two friends got the pork chops and loved it, and my Bar Burger with Zucchini fries was delicious! There was plenty of variety and healthy options on the menu. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Decided to start here for Cleveland restaurant week. I'll admit I had high hopes for this place as soon as I walked in bc I've been searching for like a place like this for a while as a resident downtown. So happy that the food was AWESOME. I hope they add the bbq shrimp (shrimp wrapped in bacon with bbq sauce) if aren't on the menu already. Probably could have eaten that as a meal bc they were so good. For my main course I got the braised short ribs with Mac and cheese. Gravy or whatever the sauce was on the ribs was delicious and the Mac and cheese was one of the best I've had and I don't say that lightly. Donuts were a great way to finish the meal. Joe was our server and he was great. Super friendly, but not overbearing like some restaurants downtown. I'll definitely be back to try their burgers which looked really good and I'm also happy to see they're open late for when I need some munchies after a night on the town."}
{"text":"I got the double decker. It's the best breakfast invention since eggs. If I come back to Cleveland, this is the first place il visit."}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere inside is cool, the tacky window paint gave us a bad vibe. Pretty good food but adequate service at best."}
{"text":"It's easier to find an Asian guy in the NBA than it is to find this place.
It's easier to find a Mensa member at an Adam Sandler movie screening than it is to find this place.
It's easier to find a craft beer at a NASCAR race than it is to find this place.

I think you get the picture. I just had to get this out right up front because it's like trying to find the door to Narnia (sorry, had one more). Your GPS will tell you that it's just right there on the corner, but A Bar and Kitchen is tucked away down an alley next to the Cleveland City Club building. Actually, you can get to the restaurant by entering the City Club Building and walking all the way back. However you choose, it's not an easy place to find. Maybe that's why so many places have come and gone here.

Anyway, back to the review. Our visit was a late lunch on a Saturday. The place was pretty empty. Speaking of the place, it's damn big. with seating for what seems like a hundred people. We sat in the front bar area after being enthusiastically greeted by the hostess. Overall, the atmosphere is somewhere between downtown Cleveland bar and upscale gastropub. I think it must have been the cheesy Miller Light St. Patrick's Day decals all over the windows that brought down the class factor just a bit. There's also a big space where it looks like a fireplace should/used to be. That would be an awesome addition.

As far as libations, there are several signature house cocktails listed on the menu along with a selection of bottles beers and a handful of taps (kudos for the local love for Great Lakes, Fat Head's, Thirsty Dog and Brew Kettle). Limited, sure, but I didn't have any trouble settling on a tasty mocha java porter from Atwater Brewing. The drink my wife had, the Raspberry Sunshine was very sweet but the addition of Hoegaarden made for an interesting touch.

Our server was very friendly and accomodating throughout our meal so there were no issues on this front.

The menu is definitely well-done with a large and varied selection of both small and large plates. It's definitely on the upscale side of things so expect more than your typical bar fare when dining here. Here's how our meal went:

Pub Crisps - a huge and very shareable portion of house-made potato chips served with a side of chipotle cheddar bacon dip. The chips were well done but the dip was the star of this show. Creamy, smoky, just a hint of heat. I wanted some to take home. NOTE: Their burgers/sandwiches come with chips, too. 

Skewers - marinated skewers of chicken and pork served atop a bed of cold Asian slaw and with a side of Thai chili sauce. Not bad. The meat was a bit overdone, but still tasty, and the slaw with its sesame oil was crispy and refreshing.

Strawberry Salad - The combination of fresh spinach, strawberries, red onions, goat cheese and pecans has got to be my favorite salad and the white balsamic vinaigrette was just the right amount of acid. A great salad.

Chicken Paprikash Soup - I'd call this more of a cheese soup with it's curly noodles and thick cheese sauce. There wasn't all that much chicken or paprika, so I didn't get as much of the paprikash thing as I expected, but it was still good.

Lamb Burger - Delicious. The lamb was cooked a perfect medium (as requested) and seasoned perfectly and the buttery, toasted brioche bun slathered with cool cucumber and spinach aioli was the perfect topping. The fact that they hit the temp spot on was enough to win me over on this one.

Aside from needing a sherpa to find the place, we had a really nice lunch at A Bar and Kitchen. Our service was good, the food was tasty and a welcome respite from traditional greasy bar food and the atmosphere was classy without being pretentious and comfortable without being worn-in. I do think they'll have a challenge if from nothing else but the very location of the restaurant, but for a place that's only been open a few months they seem to already be winning over some fairly hard-to-please critics."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Found the recommendations on YELP! Though a little hard to find, the service and food was excellent. The entrance is actually in the alley between the restaurant and the parking structure next door. Nice business district in the city. AJ wax our server.  He was very attentive and courteous. I had the stuffed chicken with rice and sautéed chard -- it was fantastic! My husband had the stuffed burger and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Definitely try this place when you're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We stopped at the A Bar and Kitchen while staying at the Holiday Inn Express right across the street. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and clean. We went on a Tuesday evening so the bar area was pretty full but we were able to sit in the dining area right away. They had kid menus for our two kids aged 4 and 1. We ordered a bar snack of Zucchini Fries with Ranch with a bonus of being $1 off for Happy Hour. I ordered a Bloody Mary (extremely well priced), my husband a soda and they had milk for the little ones. For our meals, I ordered the Stuffed Burger with A Bar fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted awesome. I also really liked the malt vinegar Aioli that came with the fries so much, I put some on the burger too. My husband ordered the A Bar steak smothered with cooked mushrooms and onions. The steak was cooked perfectly medium how he likes. The steak came with a salad and a TON of A Bar fries. My teenager ordered the Mac + Cheese with Chicken and absolutely loved his meal, and for only $2 extra to add chicken there was a lot of chicken added. For the little ones, at first, I thought the kids meals were a bit pricy but when I realized it included the meal (they got Mac and Cheese, plus a side of apples with peanut butter or veggies and dip plus a drink and an ice cream sundae or brownie sundae it was WELL worth the cost. 

Overall the entire dinner was great. We left stuffed, enjoyed the atmosphere (my kids especially loved putting money in the really cool jukebox and dancing) and reasonable prices, we will definitely be coming back next time we are in town. We would really love to come back some Sunday morning for brunch. If you haven't tried this restaurant yet, you are truly missing out!"}
{"text":"Food was so good! We came in based off Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. We will definitely be back. Too many things we wanted to try. Sunday has a special brunch menu and Bloody Mary bar set-up. Service was friendly and quick. Go try it out!!"}
{"text":"22 close friends gathered for brunch!  Delighted to encounter a wonderful meal, fantastic service.  Large portions!!!"}
{"text":"I should have known I could trust local Yelpers on this one--what a great addition to the downtown food/bev scene! 

As most of you reading this already know, their location isn't ideal. Many a' business before them have tried this space and failed, but I'm holding onto hope that A Kitchen + Bar will make it work, and here's why: 

The food is awesome. I'm not one to go out and order \"healthy\" things. I can make those things at home, usually better than most restaurants (not to toot my own horn, but it's true), so I went all out. My friend and I tried the mac n' cheese, the charcuterie board, the reuben and the calamari. I can't comment on the calamari, since I don't eat it, but let me tell you about the rest: 

- Mac 'n cheese my face off. Seriously. Check out my photo. This ooey-gooey, spiral-noodle goodness was prepped \"stovetop-style\" which is my favorite. Take your baked  macaroni and cheese and hit the road. Ain't noboby got time for that. There wasn't an over-whelming cheese punch, just the melty, creamy taste of a classic dish you'll want in your life on a daily basis. Again, I can't compliment this dish enough--the flavors melded perfectly and the pasta itself was perfectly cooked--not too al dente, not mushy.

- Charcuterie board wins my love if for no other reason than their kick-ass decision to include one of my favorite cheeses of all time, Red Dragon mustard cheese. Ermahgerd. The photo I took didn't include the plate of crackers--but I will say an addition of some warm baguette would just set this board off. It's simple: three cheeses, three meats and some sliced fruit. I also loved that there was nothing on this board that threw me face-first outside of my comfort zone. I don't like goat cheese or blue cheese. I don't want headcheese or any other weird meats you've made up with leftover animal parts. I'll take my traditional salamis, cured meats, thank you. This board didn't disappoint, but also didn't slap me in the face with awesome-sauce either. It was just a solid, safe and tasty take on charcuterie.

- That reuben though. It was damn good. I was disappointed in my over-ordering skills since by the time I got to this delicious, freshly grilled sammie--I was way too full. But even in my over-indulged state, I managed to gobble down two big bites of a great sandwich. It wasn't the best reuben I've ever had, but it was up there! 

And that's it for the food. I was lucky enough to have some time to chat with the owner, who happens to be one heck of a nice fellow. In the short time I spoke with him, I could tell the passion and hard work he has put into this place--which you'll see too, just by tasting the food. 

There were only two things that threw me off a bit on my first visit: 
1) Our server took some coaxing to warm up to us. But once he did, he was very nice. I attribute this \"warm-up\" stage to a couple of things... one being that we came in at about 10/11PM and the other being we were dressed as Sonic the Hedgehog, etc. since we came from the CLE Comic Con. He was probably a little skeptical about whether we were going to be those drunk, annoying chicks at the bar--which I can understand. 
2) Clientele. Now, I know this isn't their fault, which is why I didn't dock stars for this, but as I mentioned, we walked in to this place in costume. We weren't obnoxious or loud. Our costumes weren't overly showy or sexy--but if you could have felt the stink eyes we were getting it would have made you turn right around and walk right out. Luckily for me, I give zero craps about what a table of 20-30 something basics think of my attire, but Comic Con (and other large events hosted at the new Convention Center) can bring a lot of tourists into the area--which is great for businesses like this! And to have locals giving each guest an ocular pat-down with stank face when they walk in the door could be a detriment to this business. It shouldn't matter if I came in dressed in a three piece suit after work or whatever. Just be on the alert for these types of folks here--hopefully my incident wasn't their typical crowd (I don't think it really is.)"}
{"text":"I have been to A Bar and Kitchen 2 times now within the last month and both experiences were very positive! I have only been there for drinks and snacks, but both experiences would keep me coming back. The pub chips are great and a perfect snack. Their drink selection is solid and what you would expect in a casual upscale bar in Cleveland. I hope this place continues to catch on and can succeed in a location others could not. I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to drop by A Bar and Kitchen today and I'm really glad I did. Food was fantastic, the bartenders knew how to make quality drinks, atmosphere was inviting and very comfortable and the service was great. It's no wonder there are so many good reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere the staff is very friendly. I ordered the jerk pasta which was amazing and had a nice kick to it which i was not expecting at. The ceaser salad that i ordered could have used a little bit more dressing bit other than that it was a great restaurant. I would come back next time in in downtown."}
{"text":"OMG SO GOOD! I saw this place pop up in my Yelp feed and immediately bookmarked it as a place to check out ASAP and so glad I did! Other reviews say this place is hard to find, but a quick look at the map and you can see it is in the middle of East 8th street (a side street between Prospect and Euclid), and if you're going East on Euclid you can see a big banner on the side of the building. I was lucky and got a spot right on Euclid and with a few quick steps I was inside and quickly seated at the bar with my friend. 

First off, very nice modern and classy decor, and very spacious. The kind of style that doesn't need to try and still comes off as an inviting and perfect setting for a business meeting, happy hour with friends, or date night with your lover. The music played overhead is neither loud nor annoying; my friend was actually doing a little shoulder shake in her chair to one of the songs. 

Now for the food. During happy hour their bar snacks are a dollar off, they have $6 fancy drink specials, and a discount on their craft beers on tap as well. I skipped the drinks tonight and aimed my focus on the food. I started with the homemade bacon and cheese tots and instead of their ketchup, I asked for a side of their cajun aioli to dip my tots in. I'll be honest here, I usually don't like tots because they are too small and fried for my tastes, but I hadn't had carbs in 5 days and I was about to stab someone so I went with the tots. SMART CHOICE! They come in a serving size of 8 and are maybe double the size of a regular pre-made frozen tot. Ohh and that canjun aioli? Just the perfect amount of kick that went really well with the tots. 

Next up was a reuben sans bun with green beans instead of the house chips. The corned beef had a delightful. unique, slightly sweet taste to it that really made it stand apart from the stuff you'd get at Slyman's or Danny's Deli. I was told this is because they make their own brine for the corned beef and use various spices like nutmeg in it. I also really enjoyed the side of green beans; they had a light seasoning of salt and pepper on them and were cooked perfectly in my opinion (not so soft and limp like canned beans, but also not so stiff and gross like the frozen ones). I did steal two noodles from my friend's jerk pasta and lordy lordy, I must say I don't know how people can remain composed and not lick the sauce off the bowl that stuff was so good! 

One of the owners stopped by to see how we were enjoying our experience; I ALWAYS appreciate a business taking the time to make sure their customers are enjoying themselves. We all got to talking and the owner showed us the private banquet room in the back that can fit about 45 people and has it's own bar. I would definitely suggest this place for a Yelp event, a supper club, or even a professionals networking event. 

My bill was $21 including tax and 20% tip. Not bad in my opinion especially when the food is homemade and has real flavor. If you check in with the Yelp app you get 10% off your bill, and hold on to that receipt because it is good for 10% off their Sunday brunch! I will definitely be coming back and telling everyone about this great new addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon to try this establishment out today. It is out of business, we lost money on Groupon and had to pay parking as well."}
{"text":"Service is AMAZING and so kind. Honestly never been to a restaurant that is so sincere with really great food. The perfect place for a group of friends. All of the food is made in house (homegrown!) and Taylor the server is so sincere!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town to go to a Browns game!  Zach was our server and took great care of us!  The food there is excellent!  We ordered tater tots to start and then got the A Bar Burger and Pulled Pork.  Both are great!  This is a great little place, and if we find ourselves back in Cleveland we will DEFINITELY be back!!!  Oh and did I say, Zach was a GREAT server!!"}
{"text":"Tried to get into various restaurants before game two against Toronto to no avail.  Finally came across A Bar and Kitchen... with no wait.  Vibe in the restaurant was good and also extremely loud thanks to a nearby table of drunken twenty-somethings.  My wife and daughter tried the grilled chicken salad which they thought was good, but the chicken was dry.    My son tried the wings and said they were really good.  I had the 8th street chicken which was pretty good, but the tater tots were cold - ever had cold tater tots?  Not pleasant.  Service was about average.  

Overall this was just an average experience.  I would probably go back, but am not in a hurry to do so.  Lots of other restaurants in the area that are a notch above A Bar and Kitchen."}
{"text":"they don't even deserve a star, the service was awful, we arrived on game night ( which i know gets pretty busy) we sat and we order a couple of beers and something for dinner, we waited for an hour and a half for our food to come, i ordered a cesar salad, my friend ordered a burger and my husband ordered a chicken sandwich, when finally the food arrived the hamburger was cold, my salad was poorly served and when my husband  bit his chicken sandwich the chicken was raw, we talked to the waiter and he didn't seem upset about anithing, he got mad and ask us if we wanted something else, we didn't wanted anything just the check and to never come back to that awful place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here right before the baseball game ended, so there was literally one two other people in the whole place. I liked the window painting that advertised a discount with a baseball ticket. The entrance to this place is a little odd and off the road.

My boyfriend got the bar burger, which came with chips. Overall, he said the burger was decent but that the homemade chips were better. I ordered the mac n cheese with bacon, and it was scrumptious. It has been awhile since I've been to a place that will give you a big portion of mac n cheese and have it be super saucy. Not any of that slightly gooey business. It was all over the place so much so that I got to scoop some of it with the chips. Now that's worth 4 stars for sure. It was spiral noodles, with a creamy cheesy sauce, with bacon and crunchy bread crumbs on top (I'm a sucker for bread crumbs!). 

I think it was a worthy stop!"}
{"text":"great space and atmosphere. good spot to go with friends or family before a cavs game. service is quick and friendly. menue is a little small i got the chicken parm grilled wings they were a little under flavor for my liking."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so loved.  Came in for some drinks and snacks.  Our server forgot about us at one point.  The tater tots, while dense, were only 9 in number and lacked flavor.  The ketchup that came with the tots was just Heinz mixed with canned chipotle sauce added.  The pork rinds came in a massive portion that dwarfed the tots, which seemed silly.  The mustard sauce that came with the rinds was way too overpowering.  The rinds themselves barely tasted seasoned.    My friend got the pulled pork sandwhich, which was huge. The size to cost ratio of the pulled pork was so much better than the stupid tots app that I wished I just got a pile of pulled pork.  The pulled pork tasted ok but it wasn't anything special or worth bragging about.  Had our server not forgotten about us I would give this place 3 stars.  The food is ok but it's not worth going out of your way.  But the service dropped this down to two stars.  There's way better spots to hit up in this town."}
{"text":"decent food, solid beer list, not much personality, tho, and the space is huge. thus, 3 stars."}
{"text":"Giving them five stars for a few reasons:
1.) Best Reuben I've Ever Had. 
2.) I went on a Tuesday with my hubby and we liked it so much that we dragged our friends back that Friday. We are followers, not leaders. We hardly ever suggest a place outside of our friend groups comfort zone. But we just wanted to share it that bad!
3.) Happy hour goes from 4-8! 4-8! Then there is an additional time for drink specials from 8-9!! Anyone who routinely gets out of work after 6pm will understand why this gives me a lady boner
4.) They have only been open a short time and are already creating a buzz, they seem passionate about what they do, and I really hope the location in an Alley doesn't stop this place from becoming a success.

Back to that Reuben. Holy cow. Melt in your mouth homemade corned beef, perfect amount of sauerkraut, buttered marble bread, and house made thousand island (on the side, thank god, so I could slather on an embarrassing amount). 

Other items tried:
- 8th Street Chicken Sandwich. Yes, just yes. A perfect example of how separately delicious ingredients come together to make a masterpiece. Fried chicken cutlet, 3 chile pepper Gouda, Cajun mayo, slaw, marinated tomatoes, all on pumpernickel. I love pumpernickel but can never figure out what the hell kind of sandwich to make it on - the answer is fried chicken. Lightly fried and thin enough that you can actually bite into the sandwich. The mayo and chile Gouda added a great spicy component that was pleasant and not overwhelming. The slaw was the perfect crispy component and I would've probably even liked it as a side. I don't usually like tomato on my sandwich but whatever they marinated them in made it a welcome addition. Definitely recommend this sandwich!
- Peperonata calamari - lightly coated in batter, perfectly cooked and delicate, loved the spicy addition of the peppers. Mustard aioli was a good balance to the spice. (There was also marinara but I would eat mustard from a spoon if I could so that tomato sauce was neglected)
- Mussels In a saffron cream sauce - one or two were overcooked but I think I just let them sit on my plate for too long because I couldn't put down the Reuben I was sharing with my husband. I enjoyed the cream sauce and would order them again
- Pub crisps with chipotle cheddar bacon dip - the chips are also what comes with the sandwiches. Fried to perfection and pure potato goodness, I always like a good homemade chip. I would've liked more salt, but usually when something is salty enough for my palate others find it overly salty. The dip was tasty but I wish there was more of it. Nice smoky flavor and creamy, a good compliment to the chips. There were no chunks of bacon, which I was actually happy about because I liked the texture of the dip.
- Hangover fries - $6 is a little steep for an add on of the hangover fries, which are good but not $6 good. 

Overall, great new downtown spot that I know I'll continue to enjoy. Good atmosphere, not too loud, friendly waitstaff. Looking forward to trying the Mac n cheese and the tots, though it's going to be really hard to order something other than the Reuben or 8th St chicken!!"}
{"text":"I hope this place becomes a Cleveland staple. 

The \"A\" Bar and Kitchen is in an Alley (get it?), so finding it might be the only downfall for this place. Luckily, it's name is painted on a giant wall so if you are going east down Euclid avenue, you will not miss it!

The inside of this place is huge--once you think you've seen it all, there's more room in the back! Great venue for large groups for sure. And plenty of TVs so you don't miss any of your favorite sporting events.

The ambiance is not like your typical, divey sports bar. The restrooms are clean, you can actually carry on a conversation with someone without screaming, and if my memory serves me right, I am pretty sure there is a fireplace in the middle. But don't worry - dress is still casual! 

We came here for dinner this week...twice. Yep, it was that good. First go around, we tried a little bit of everything. The calamari was good, especially if you like yours more on the spicy side. I got the A Bar Burger which was unlike any burger I've had in town. My fav part of it was the pastrami and marinated tomato. My mouth is watering just thinking of it. I opted to pay the few extra bucks and upgraded the potato chips to a side of hangover fries. You can see by my picture that those fries were intense! A little too intense for me, but the fiance was eating them right up.

We also got a side of the risotto cakes (yum) and a Reuben sandwich. Chris said it was one of the best Reubens he's ever had. We found out later that week, that they do the pastrami in-house. I hope it never leaves home because it was thebomb.com. Chris had to take half of it home because it was so big and we overindulged on all of the delicious food. 

Our second trip here this week, I got the 8th Street Chicken Sandwich which has become my new favorite chicken sandwich in the area. I ate the entire sandwich. So so so good. And prices for food are not that bad. No, it's not dirt cheap like the divey bars, but you are also getting much higher quality food and service for the few extra bucks you may spend. 

As far as drinks go, they had about 10 beers on tap and a wide selection of bottles. We also happened to come on a weekday, between 8-9pm (Mighty Fine 8 to 9), so anything on tap was $2 and bottles were $4. We did a lot of drinking in one hour.

Lastly, I don't want to forget to mention the service. Both visits, we had really friendly and really attentive servers and bartenders. They made sure we were taken care of the whole night. Both of them suggested we come back for Sunday brunch, which I plan on doing very soon. I hear an out-of-this world, monstrous breakfast sandwich calling my name..."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited this place earlier this month. It is a nice atmosphere and the workers were really nice, which is always a plus. I got a Caesar salad, which was pretty good. My fiancé got some great tots. Overall, good place, we will probably come back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Especially around the field/arena. The manager is a real cool guy. He'll sit there and joke with you if you are friendly like that"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant on a Monday night to celebrate my anniversary and I was definitely impressed. Like other reviewers noted, it was pretty empty but it seems more people are coming to this restaurant even with the cold and snow, which is great! This place really is huge and really is hard to find unless you know exactly where it is. The great thing is that there there is a parking lot literally across the alley way which is $6 bucks in the evening. Make sure you take the ticket then pay for it in the kiosk before you leave.

Back to the restaurant...

Our waiter was very attentive to use the entire evening and very personable. He had good recommendations and always made sure he checked in on us, but not too much to be obnoxious. For our meal, my wife ordered the steak and I ordered the stuffed burger with tots as an appetizer. As we were enjoying our delicious tots, our waiter comes over and lets us know that the chef accidentally made a steak burger, not the steak itself so he apologized and offered to buy us a round of drinks. Since my wife doesn't drink, he took care of both drinks I ordered. Talk about service! And it really didn't take that long to get our food. 

The food itself was very good. Not huge portions but not small either. And I felt I didn't overpay for the food I ordered so that was nice since I am quite cheap. The burger, though advertised as cooked medium-well because of the cheese inside, had some nice pink to it which I appreciated. Very flavorful.

Overall, we really enjoyed it and it made for a great anniversary dinner. Like other people have said, we are really rooting for this restaurant. It's one of my favorite in the city. Just don't get too crowded please."}
{"text":"I brought my father here for our pre-game meal and we were not disappointed! First win, Bourbon Barrel Ale, thank you.  Second - I chose this restaurant over another because they had scotch eggs and I had always wanted to try them - unbelievably delicious!  I decided to go healthy after our scrumptious appetizer and have a side of the quinoa and a side salad.  Perfect! I was grateful they had both guilty and healthy pleasures on their menu!
My father had a burger that was perfectly cooked.  So to summarize, our meal and service were of the highest quality.  I will be back again! If you haven't tried this place, make it your next Cleveland dining spot!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking this place out based on all the positive reviews I read on Yelp. However, I have to admit I was quite dissappointed. The service was fine but the actual food and environment wasn't anything special. Our group ordered the following:
Downtown Donkey Cocktail (good! with a little kick to it)
Hummus trio
Shrimp primavera
Mac and Cheese
Fish Tacos

Again, none of it was terrible but none of it was amazing either. Additionally, I think the bar area is the only area in the restaurant that has a nicer scene / environment. Once you pass that section of the restaurant, it's pretty bare and uninspiring."}
{"text":"\"A Bar and Kitchen\" in downtown Cleveland was a hidden surprise. My husband ordered the \"Cleveland Burger\", new on the menu. A burger with high-quality beef stuffed with corned beef and topped with a fried egg all on a fresh brioche roll. I ordered veggie cakes with red pepper humus, made fresh to order; with the best grilled asparagus I have ever had. I could not say one bad thing about the food, our server said everything is made from scratch except the rolls. 

We were visiting the city for the weekend, and after not being able to find the restaurant somebody recommended we took a peek in \"A Bar and Kitchen\". I have to say I was a little unsure; it only had one other group in there and it looked like a nightclub/bar trying to be a restaurant during the day. At that point we were too hungry to keep going, so we tried it.
 
Our server/bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the city. Gave us a lot of great ideas for our weekend. The food was amazing and fresh, especially the veggie cakes, I expected some type of a pre-made frozen ones. As we were eating a man walked out and asked how everything was. After he walked away our server said he was the chef and he takes a lot of pride in everything he makes. You certainly could tell by the food. 

They said they have only been open about a year. There is construction on the main road (Euclid I think) you would use to get to the restaurant. It is down a little side street and because of the construction the sidewalk is closed, we just happened upon it. I didn't look like much from the outside either, like a bar. 

This dining experience can appeal to all types of diners. As you can tell by our choices we have burger lover and a vegetarian. Lunch with a beer each came out to about $40. Honestly rarely are we both happy with our food when we pick a restaurant. I don't think we will ever come back to Cleveland, but I want to always share great dining experiences. We were in Cleveland four nights and this was by far one of the best dining experiences we had. The only reason I gave this a four-star instead of five-star is the over-all ambience. The food and service was definitely a five-star."}
{"text":"I went in the early afternoon and got the wings. They were absolutely excellent. The only reason I can't rate them higher is that I got the impression I was an inconvenience to the bar tender."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Ron, was AWESOME!!!! So fun!!! The food was great and the drinks were very tasty!!! If you go --- get the chicharrons and chips!! Also, the sangria with some cherries is to die for!! Don't miss out on this cute place!"}
{"text":"Find The City Club and go behind it and you'll find A Kitchen and A Bar - great place to go to watch the games or get something to eat before the game. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and there weren't many people there. But Gabbi was great and the food was really good. Burger rocked."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place isn't always packed. It's a hidden jewel. The food is always amazing. The staff are great! The owners are fantastic and sincere! Drinks are good. If you find yourself in downtown you should swing by. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service. The chocolate drinks are good, not a gimmick. The food tasted great. It took a while but was worth it."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre...came out COLD. Server was very friendly, but the timing of when meals were delivered to us was horrible. Received all of our meals and dinner salads at the same time and people's steaks and meals were COLD. Better mgmt and more staff needed and this place has potential to be successful"}
{"text":"Nice spot located on east 8th street between Prospect and Euclid avenue.  I went in on a snowy Sunday which happened to be the last day of downtown restaurant week.      The spinach and artichoke dip was exceptional (served with warm pita triangles).  The red velvet waffle (which was green in honor of St.Patrick's day) was tasty but not heavy.  The chicken was good but had a bit too much breading.  The bartender Taylor was super informative and helpful (he let me use his charger to charge my phone).  They offer a Sunday brunch and a happy hour that I will be trying out soon. 

Happy Hour (4pm to 8pm)
-6$ double long island
-6$ downtown monkey/old fashioned
-1$ off beer
-1$ off bar snacks
-3.50$ wells
Mighty Fine from 8 to 9
-2$ drafts
-2$ well liquors

Great place to stop before a CAVS game."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try A Bar before a cavs game and I really enjoyed my experience. Since we didn't have a whole lot of time before the game, we sat at the bar for drinks and some appetizers.  Their happy hour was pretty great and went until 8 pm, which is later then most places do happy till.  I got a double long island iced tea and went with the zucchini fries for a snack.  Those are under the bar snacks area of the menu and during happy hour they are $1 dollar off all bar snacks.  They came out very hot and crispy, seasoned well and with a side of zesty ranch.  That is all we really had time to get, but I am definitely planning to come back for dinner.
Part of the reason I had never been here before is because it is so hidden, but once you get inside, the restaurant is very clean, modern and just has a really great atmosphere with plenty of places to sit and a large bar.  The wall behind the bar is all exposed brick and really adds to why I loved being in here."}
{"text":"Lamb burger was delicious! Stopped in on a Saturday for a quick lunch... almost did brunch but the burgers looked too good to pass up."}
{"text":"A group of seven of us went here the other night. 

The service was quick, but our server literally knew nothing about the menu. 

We all had questions about the soup, sauces and salad sizes and she was clueless. 

She described the soup as \"lumpy and thick\" and she said, \"the chicken is so big I thought it was potatoes.\" Delicious............can't wait..................

When we asked which sauce was spicer on the chicken skewers she had no idea and verbally debated with herself right in front of us. 

When we asked her about salad sizes she only said \"the large isn't big. I wouldn't share it,\" okay.............sounds promising. 

I'm just confused how someone with no knowledge about the menu works here?

No wonder this place was completely dead on a Saturday night. 

The only reason I'm giving two stars is because my salad had AMAZING Caesar dressing and 6/7 of us enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Went here before a play a few months ago for dinner with another couple. We both purchased groupons. My boyfriend got the stuffed chicken... he had to send it back 3 times. It was well under-cooked. The manager apologized and took it off the bill and gave us some apps and such for free which was nice but then when we went to pay I couldn't even use the groupon because we had no food on our check just the drinks. I will not be returning to use the goupon.. don't want to get food poisoning."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday party. We were in a private room in the back. I'd highly recommend it for smaller get together a where you want privacy. They ordered some appetizers primarily a dip trio with chips and all of the food was really good. Hey also let my friends bring in a DJ and their own dessert which was nice."}
{"text":"I decided to go here with a friend after reading all of the stellar reviews. And I'm always looking for a go to spot downtown. This is most likely not going to become that for me. The food was just okay. One of those places that the menu sounds better than the food actually tastes. Could have been that I just had high expectations after reading the reviews. We got the calamari- def not the best I've had, and the sauces that go with them didn't really add much flavor- the marinara was just boring.  I got the A bar burger that looked really delicious, but turned out to be just a soggy mess by the time it got to me. We also went on a slow night, so I feel like our waitress should have been around, but multiple times we had to walk up to the bartender to ask for things. Not what you'd expect when you're one of two seated tables. On the plus side, the drinks are very well priced- I was most excited by that :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I visisted A Bar last week when we were in town celebrating our anniversary, we found A Bar thru the great reviews on Yelp after a great comedy show on friday we had dinner which was awesome, the 8th st chicken was amazing and my wife had the reuben which she said was awesome.  
After deciding what to eat saturday night us and friends chose A Bar again it was awesome yet again we got the fried planks the mix of pepper jack, cheddar and mozz was awesome.  We will definently come back every time we come to cleveland thank you for two GREAT meals!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute. Unpretentious. Solid bar food. Cute bartenders (of the male variety). I wouldn't go in expecting culinary vision and a chef obsessing over ingredient sourcing and plating. I would expect a place that has burgers and some closer in foods at a local bar that's a tucked away (read not easy to find)."}
{"text":"Just went in for take out we were staying at hotel across the street.  I swear this may be best kept secret ... Reuben, fried chicken sandwich and burger better than I've had anywhere.  Only issue is there was no thousand island dressing or any dressing on reuben.  Wonder if they forgot it.  They also indulged my request for real silver ware for a to go order... Super nice owners seriously good food.  Burger is just crazy good.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"When we were in Cleveland for a conference earlier this fall, my colleague and I enjoyed trying out the local restaurant scene. 

One of our favorite places was A Bar and Kitchen, a true dive that we visited our last night in town. It met every definition of a dive - a sign that you could only see if you wandered down a pothole-filled alley and, because we had a wheelchair in tow, a hidden entrance that the staff directed us to instead of the main stair-laden entrance. By the way, the overabundance of stairs and no accommodation really for handicapped patrons is why I'm knocking a star off the review. We had to go into an office building and have a staff member meet us at a not-an-entrance door to let us us. Not ideal.

This, by the way, is a complaint I have about most of Cleveland. How that city is skirting ADA so blatantly, I'll never understand.

However, we were rewarded for our crazy find-your-way-in experience with some really great bar food. The menu had a whole section devoted to tots. TOTS!!!! How could I resist the Reuben tots? Not even possible.

My colleague had the burger, which looked so good I wish I had it, too. But I ordered the bacon mac-and-cheese and was not disappointed. Not at all. So creamy. So delicious. So wanting it right now.

I also tried out one of the local brews and learned that the Dortmunder Gold was not my favorite. I guess our Texas craft beers have spoiled my taste buds.

If I go back to Cleveland, A Bar and Kitchen will definitely be on my list of places to eat at!"}
{"text":"This was a very nice find in Cleveland. The bar huge with many options for seating or standing. It has a mini arcade and billiards. And the service and waitstaff was phenomenal. I felt like we were all old friends by the time my meal was over.

I ordered a mimosa, and it was excellent. They serve brunch, so I ordered a spinach, pepper and onion omelette. It was fantastic! Super cheesy and extra fluffy. The hash browns were great too.

Above all, the service is what will bring me back to this place. I was completely taken care of and made to feel like my experience here mattered. Will definitely be going back any time I am in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Went here when visiting Playhouse Square for a Saturday night show. Everywhere we went you needed a reservation or a hour long wait.  We not only got seated right away but the service was excellent and the food was very good. We had Caesar salads and wings ( two favors )  and the pulled pork sandwich and the mac and cheese so for everyone to love their food should tell you a lot. I saw a lot of different foods go by our table and it all looked so good. I will definitely be going back to this place again to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Just came for a few drinks before dinner.

A Bar and Kitchen is located in an Alley, but there is plenty of signage to announce it's location (and a parking structure and lot near by).

The atmosphere is really nice.  It's casual without being sloppy, but also a little on the upscale side.

The menu consisted of a few sandwiches, burgers, salads, pasta, chicken, seafood and steak.  There appears to be something for everyone...  They also have a nice appetizer selection and their happy hour specials included certain amounts off of beer, cocktails and \"bar snacks\".

I ended up getting their \"Downtown Donkey\" which is basically a Moscow Mule.  I liked the Ginger Beer they used and asked the bartender about it (I like to make them at home).  He mentioned it was Goya brand.  I had never had it before, but it was a little spicier than other ginger beers (which I like).  I would recommend.

I also ended up getting \"An Apple of My Eye\" which is cider reduction, muddled fruit and rye.  It was a little tarter than I like in my drinks (but it's not exactly cider season), but if you like bourbon, I would say give it a shot.

The bartenders were pretty nice and attentive.

I would say it's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Ask for Zack, he knows the menu front and back and will tell you what you need to know. Great service. Have the wings (best I've ever had). Great ambience, food, and service. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Interesting to say the least. Went there for dinner around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday. Plenty of places to sit, there was literally one guy sitting at the bar. I know this place does better for lunch than dinner but was very surprised ONE person was patronizing them. 
A few things I noticed. 1. Miller Lite is spelled wrong on the menu. How hard is it? Not Light. 
2. I ordered a stuffed burger w/ Hang Over fries (A $3  upgrade) Nope. The bartender said there was an error and the Hang Over fries were $7 extra. White Out anyone? 
I ordered the Stuffed Burger w/ Fries. The bartender was very attentive... Well we were the only two in the joint. Burger came out hot and tasted great. My favorite part may have been the fries and the dipping sauce. Not sure what the dipping sauce was but it was great. 
Overall a nice experience. We will be back for more. Nice amount of Craft beers for the Snobs but they don't discriminate against Domestic drinkers.
I hope this place becomes more noticeable. The location is tough but hopefully word of mouth will give them the business they deserve."}
{"text":"Great service, really enjoyed talking to the bartender and server. Bacon and chicken Mac n cheese"}
{"text":"I'm a little delayed on writing this review, but I've had it on my \"to-do\" list because I needed to share my awesome experience at this restaurant!

It was a Wednesday night, I believe.  I'm a teacher by trade, and the brutal cold resulted in several days off for me.  Boredom was quickly setting in so I ventured out to find a good meal.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5pm and were the only ones there.  Later on in the evening it started to fill up a bit.

We like sitting at the bar.  It gives us a chance to talk with the bartenders about the restaurant and get the inside scoop on the scene.  We ended up having terrific conversations with the bartender and the manager.  They have several craft beers on tap that are reasonably priced.  They also have a happy hour menu which is unusual for a downtown restaurant.  

The food is wonderful.  We started with the cheese planks and calamari.  Both were elevated to a new level.  The cheese planks are made with several different varieties of cheese, one of them being pepperjack.  Yum, Yum, Yum.  For our meals, I ordered A Bar Burger and my dining companion ordered the 8th street chicken sandwich.  I know, sounds boring, right?  No, no, no, my friend.  Both sandwiches  have made their way to my top 3 list.  The burger had so many components such as being served on a pretzel bun and topped with tender pastrami.  The chicken sandwich is buttermilk fried and topped with 3 chili pepper gouda, Cajun mayo, and Dijon slaw.  We had so much food that lunch the next day rocked!

I can't wait to frequent this restaurant before we go to Indians games or any other time we head downtown.  This is my new \"go-to\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food if your looking for something outside the norm. Great service! I will def go back next time I'm in Cleveland ."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and read some reviews on where to go so STOP reading reviews and come here!!! Food,drinks and staff amazing - Taylor our server was amazing and passionate about his job here:)"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away and kind of hidden from the main drag but it's totally worth checking out! We came here before seeing a show at playhouse and could not have been not more delighted with my choice. 
We arrived during happy hour which lasts till 8pm on Fridays (nice!) So we were able to take advantage of some drink specials and bar snack specials. I started with an old fashioned.. I'm not gonna lie, not the best I've ever had, but I wasn't expecting the best ever. It was decent. For food we started with the zucchini fries and the cheese sticks. Both were fried deliciousness. I liked that the cheese sticks had different kinds of cheese. Made it fun. 
For our entrées I went with the 8th street chicken sandwich. I loved the sweet coleslaw with the fried chicken. Great pairing. My husband had the Mac and cheese with chicken. Woah. Huge portion for something SO rich. Next time, we'll share that and just get apps. Although it was rich, it was definitely better than the average bar Mac and cheese. 
To top off the great bar food, they offered a 10%off coupon if you check in on Yelp! Can't beat that! Next time I'm downtown and need a bite, this place will absolutely be on the list!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to eat during a work trip and was very pleased. Great service and great food for a decent price. Nice atmosphere - looks like it can hold quite a bit but I was there on a Monday so it wasn't too busy. I would definitely go back. We sat at the bar and I ordered the stuffed chicken, it was great!"}
{"text":"Today I visited this establishment for lunch with three other people.  The interior is modern and very new looking.  The restaurant is surprisingly large inside but was fairly empty when I was there.  They also have a private party room with full bar service that you can rent.  I had a pulled pork sandwich and house fries.  The food and service were definitely above average but not amazing.   There were times we were left wondering where are beverages were that we ordered several minutes ago even though there were very few customers at the time.   Eventually the owner came by and introduced himself when we wanted to use our yelp 10% off deal.  Only half of us had the coupon but he just gave everyone at our table the discout.  The food was a bit pricey however the portion is a good size.  Take note that the entrance to this place is down a alley like street. If you like a modern resturant with a secret-ish entrance, come check this place out. I know I'll be back."}
