{"text":"Awesome diner food! Simple meals for a decent price!!"}
{"text":"Sunrise is my favorite breakfast spot. They also serve a decent lunch and dinner, but seeing that breakfast is the most important meal of the day Sunrise has my business. Now if they only served Mimosas...."}
{"text":"This is your traditional breakfast diner. Sometimes I am in the mood for that kind of fare. But the Sunrise just doesn't do it for me. I typically get hash browns with breakfast. Their potatoes are usually under cooked, greasy, hard in spots, lack flavor other than carbonized/burnt outside. The few time I have eaten there, my food didn't agree with me. There are better breakfast spots"}
{"text":"Their biscuits. The end. I have been here for breakfast and dinner. On the weekends in the morning it can get pretty crowded, but it's worth it. Grab some coffee and a country ham biscuit..  You can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab breakfast. They've got a full menu, full of the typical diner fare, but I never seem to get by any time but in the morning.  That's ok though, because the breakfast is priced right, tastes great, and the portions are big enough to satisfy any appetite. Here's the stuff I've sampled over the years.  - Bacon - Sausage - Turkey Sausage - Scrambled Eggs - Hashbrowns - Pancakes - French Toast - Western Omelette (Ham, Onions, Peppers) - White/Wheat Toast - Biscuits  And I've got no complaints about anything I've ever had. Awesome coffee, too. Had the Western Omelette this morning and intended to take pictures, but I was so hungry that I totally forgot, lol. Oh well, I'm sure I'll  be back, I'll grab pics next time."}
{"text":"It's rare that one finds a nice clean Caribbean fast food place. I love the dark jerk chicken here 2 pcs of jerk chicken, roti on the side, a small cup of oxtail soup and some coleslaw for under $10 - GREAT! I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars but the taste of the coleslaw and inattentive rep who was organizing our food took the charm away! Still better than the 10 other Caribbean fast food places I had food in!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Sunrise on Albemarle Road for more than twenty years.  It is one of the most consistent restaurants in regards to the taste and quality of the food in Charlotte.  If you order something you like, it will always be good.  If you order something that doesn't taste right to you, it will be the same next time.  For me, a ham and egg breakfast with toast and tomatoes is as good as it gets.  All of this for less than $8 makes for a fine morning.  You should be aware of some of the patrons.  They are not your normal uptown crowd, they're more like country comes to the city type folks.  You are not likely to see any ties or fancy dresses here, just good ole Americana."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love the service here! The Fries are my favorite item on the menu. This restaurant is very old but the food is great. I went for lunch ended coming for diner in the same day. I love how they serve the tea :)!! This is the place Dine-In place to eat at."}
{"text":"The prices are on the reasonable side. The food is ok..nothing fancy...you get what you pay for I guess. They seem to be doing something right because there always seems to be people there."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. Good biscuits and link sausages. Also I have not been disappointment with fish dishes, chicken."}
{"text":"I got some takeout from this place the other day. The other reviews are correct that the counter staff do make you feel like you're inconveniencing them. So do not expect friendly service.   The food was okay, but nothing special. This is like the McDonald's of Caribbean food. The food is sitting in warming trays (cafeteria style) and it gets slopped into paper boxes for takeout.   They give you a huge portion of rice. Too much rice. Enough rice to feed a family of 6 for dinner. And then top it with what appears to be a somewhat skimpy portion of meat compared to the rice. When I think back to my takeout order from Gem's House of Jerk where the rice to meat ratio was pretty much 1:1, the ratio here at Sunrise is more like 8:1. The rice, as abundant as it is, isn't particularly good. It's overcooked and it has that too soft texture that's just a bit offputting. Gem's rice, on the other hand, was perfection.   The jerk chicken was moderately spicy and a tad too salty. It was fine, but nothing I'd go out of my way to get again."}
{"text":"Older place, grade was decent. Server was nice, didn't mind the small talk and jokes. Food came out hot and fresh. So hungry pics didn't get taken! I had the steak and eggs with hash browns. Wheat toast was burnt around the edges. No big deal, just didn't eat the crust."}
{"text":"A great local staple. The breakfast menu is my favorite. I love the hours during the week. Note they close early on Sunday, around 3pm. Sundays, after church is their busiest time, but the food is too delicious. The sweet tea isn't the best or what true southerners prefer but gets the job done. My favorite dish is the BBQ plate. The sauce is tasty!! Sometimes the wait staff can be a bit rude but don't let that cloud your judgement of the taste of the food. Parking on Sundays can be a limited depending on the time you show up."}
{"text":"This is one of those all-american places that serves just about anything but none of it is truly outstanding.  But it is a good place to go to hang out, have some coffee, and do some people watching.  I enjoyed myself when I was there, and will probably go again.  It's good if you're in the mood for it but you're not going to seek it out."}
{"text":"This place is a mom and pop type of place. I come here in between work shifts. The staff is awesome the service is quick and the food is good. Prices aren't bad either. You definitely get what you pay for. I think the breakfast specials are the best prices in the area so if you are looking for all of the above, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"If Sunrise is open then it is usually busy. During lunch it is very busy, expect to wait a few minutes to be seated. There is a good reason for this....very good food at very good prices. This place has been around for many years and is a staple for many people in this area. Breakfast is very good and very cheap, you will leave full and satisfied. Lunch and dinner are really good and reasonably priced. The portions are generous and the wait staff is as good as it gets. They recently redid the interior ( it was getting pretty shabby ). My bottom line for Sunrise is this....if you are in the area and want a really good home style meal at at good price turn into their lot and try to find a space to park....it will be busy."}
{"text":"So good! A lot of older people frequent this establishment, which just confirms the wholesome goodness this restaurant offers.  It's affordable. They have a variety of healthy options and large portions. I had the stir fry which I was able to take home leftovers for lunch the next day.  can't believe I passed by this place so many times before giving it a try. Oh did I mentioned they serve breakfast all day. Yeahhhh"}
{"text":"Near my work. I eat here 2 X / month. I've only had the goat curry. Nice that it's boneless. Staff can be friendly but you have to catch them on a good day.  Hits the spot, nothing special but authentic enough for my Canadian tastes. $12 with a drink. Try it out. Great part is there's a Starbucks right next door so you can grab a coffee right after."}
{"text":"I can't believe people haven't tried this place yet, especially after janelle's great review!  So let me do a refresher of this place.    When approaching it one should be very cautious to not let first impressions fool you.  The sign is very colorful but in one of the most dreary areas, let alone strip malls.  I'll be honest I would probably not even stop at the nearest light anytime after 5 pm ( yes that sketchy) but again first impressions are deceiving!!!!  But don't let second impressions fool you either, because on entering you will literally think \" what happened to harvey's!!!\". The seating and layout are a perfect emulation of any local harvey's!  And if you are hoping the staff will impress you..... They won't.  They aren't the most happy people but they are quick and efficient about getting you your food.  So after all these impressions its really the final but most important impression that should blow you away... the food!   I had the jerk chicken combo and at first i wasn't impressed with my rice and chicken until I put it in my mouth and WOW! The spices are just amazing and the chicken is so soft!  I ve tried jerk chicken before and haven't been a fan, but this dish definitely made me want to try more jerk.    I dont know about the roti or the other dishes, but if janelle is right and this is the real jamacian food....I think I know where my next vacation is going to be!  And to top it off everything is around 7$ so it's not a bad deal to taste a little caribbean, west of the 410."}
{"text":"Sunrise is officially back. I am so happy to see them open again to serve the community around the area. If you been to the old location you know what to expect. It has about the same menu as the old location, however the price has increased about a dollar for each items.  They are busy the week that I went, it was a Wednesday. The service is only ok, they have table open but not enough servers, since they just opened they are working things out. I had the chicken and dumplings, it tasted just like the old times, it has flavor just simple and tasted good. The new addition to the menu will be the cold side items, they now have dessert like side dishes and it has my favorite banana pudding.   Lastly, the environment, it is a great new building, all the furniture are new. It is nice, but I have noticed there are a lot of debris on the floor. I hope that they can keep the environment clean and maintain this place a long time.  Environment: 7 out of 10 Services: 6 out of 10 Food Quality: 8 out of 10  So happy that SUNRISE is back."}
{"text":"Good for what it is. Family style place with a large menu. Nothing fancy, plain diner fare."}
{"text":"I love it here. Amazing service, great food,& very nice interior. I had the chicken Alfredo and very good. Love the creamy alfredo sauce & the pasta was/had an amazing texture."}
{"text":"An absolute gem in the city.  I've been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner and take out. I've never had anything I didn't love. The food is always hot and fresh, the staff are all friendly and AMAZING. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Best country ham biscuit I've had in a long, long time! So much delicious food and it's so dirt cheap! I've only had the breakfast but I get it very frequently. We ordered at work once with ten separate orders and they were super nice about it too and didn't complain, repeated the order back to make sure we they had everything right and they did!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service especially if you don't come from the islands.They become very stingy with the food! Have a look at my chicken. This was bullshit!$12 for what!?   They need to hire maybe some friendlier people! Let people get what they pay for.This is ridiculous! And oxtail $16 yeah ok... Rap when I can't even bless my food.   Don't recommend! Racist/rude/need better customer service!!!!  I would love to hear more about this horrible place.I will only return in your hire better people!i guarantee more people would come to , and u would have a regular!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot for breakfast and have never had any problems. Great food and service keeps my family and I coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Charlotte to have breakfast, The breakfast special Monday through Friday is a great deal"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here on a Tuesday and it was packed! The lunch specials are great--you get so much food and for a good price. I ordered the calabash shrimp and was overwhelmed with how many you got (a whole plate filled!!).   I'm eager to come back and try breakfast as there seemed to be a breakfast special for $5 or so before 1130."}
{"text":"Very clean yet older establishment. My order was this month's special, vegetable lasagna.  It was a little on the runny side and lacked flavor but I still killed it cause I hadn't eaten all day. Came with side salad which was nice and crisp but wasn't too fond of the thousand island dressing.  I feel like they have good food but being my first time, I didn't get the right thing. I would not rule them out though and visit again."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in town this is a must stop for breakfast.  Priced incredibly reasonable and quite tasty.  I love the fact that they have a turkey sausage option.  They have the biggest, tastiest biscuits in town.  The staff and service are great.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my my favorite go tos in Charlotte for a delicious breakfast!! The menu is delicious. Glad this is a new location that came back to Charlotte. The staff was awesome! Totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Been eating here 30 years. Can't beat it. The prices are fair and food fresh. They are going to a new location farther down the road across from lowes. Opening early March 2018."}
{"text":"Hit this location for dinner last night - it was clean, staff was nice.  Food was good as was price - I had the fried chicken livers - couldn't resist!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad meal here and Miss Jaime the waitress is AWESOME!!! All the staff work very hard to bring you a good home style meal.   Large portions for small prices. I've had the shrimp with soup and salad and peach cobbler, all to delish for words.  The pork chops were tender and flavorful and breakfast is super filling.  It can get VERY crowded so be prepared to wait.  Not a bad meal yet.  My go to for reasonable prices and satisfying food."}
{"text":"Quaint breakfast place in East Charlotte. I don't think you should make an exclusive trip to visit here but if you're already on this side of town it's worth a look. Just prepare yourself for wait, place is always packed yet under staffed."}
{"text":"Admittedly I don't know menu items. But the Lady working talked me through, gave me samples to taste so I'd be completely satisfied. Comfort food from another culture. Lots of fun. Diner feel without the counter. Came in for breakfast. Lots of foot traffic to go. Had the dumplin and porridge. Nice."}
{"text":"This place is chocked full of locals!! Very busy all the time. The prices are pretty good and the food is tasty but be prepared to wait. There are usually not enough staff for the amount of guests able to fill the restaurant. No matter what ive gotten from the breakfast menu, it's been good."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was told to order the Cheeseburger. Good. I must say it wasn't extremely spectacular, and it didn't wow me as in I want another one but it satisfied my cravings for a burger. And well, it filled me up. It also comes with steak fries which is okay, but I opted for a salad (gotta have some good with the bad right?!)   Service wasn't half too bad. I came late so there wasn't a water, but the good thing was that they had a huge pint of it on the table. So, I got to pour my own water and refill it whenever I wanted! (sure sounds like a waitress task, but it's okay I enjoyed it)  Overall, it's not too bad not amazing though. Sad, that this place isn't open for late night or else I would come here more often."}
{"text":"First visit and it's not my last. Great service, some of the nicest waitresses I've seen. The carafe of Ice-T was a great touch. Food came out fast and hot. Nice selection of breakfast foods to choose from. But I forget to ask if the corn beef hash was house made. Sure hope it is for my next visit. Lots of regulars which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"My new quaint, inexpensive restaurant! Plus, I love to run into people I know when here and the staff always remember me! Great desserts!!"}
{"text":"I usually check out sunrise for breakfast but decided to try them out for dinner and I was not disappointed. First and foremost I love the old school diner vibe. The customer service is friendly and it's nice to eat at a place where the regulars eat daily that really says something about a place. I ordered the salmon cakes with a side of mustard greens and pinto beans!!! The salmon cakes were awesome fresh and crispy the pinto beans were to die for along with the greens that were seasoned to perfection. The cheese cake for dessert was awesome sweet and creamy and the best part the prices are reasonable!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood spot. Their breakfast is always on point! Great prices and the service is also awesome!"}
{"text":"I had the breakfast special. It was cooked to perfection! Our waitress was really good. A real old school authentic diner! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Looked up places to go have breakfast and Sunrise came up. Seemed like a good place to try said they were open until ten and had good reviews.  We get to the address listed and there is no sign or markings on the building.  Looks like a dump when we tried to go inside the place was closed at at 11:30am.  No signs that said they were closed just locked doors, and people finishing up their breakfast waving the three cars that pulled up with us off.    I think if you own a business and change your hours you should list that....especially if you want people to review your restaurant in a. Good light.  I guess that's what you get for trying something new."}
{"text":"Great food for the typical diner style fare. My husband has bacon and eggs and the eggs were perfectly cooked! Very hard to do. Also, they have the shredded hash browns, which I think are much better than home fries. I had the club with fries. The portion sizes are big and the prices are good.   The service seemed to be the best part. All the servers were attentive and Britanny, our server, was present enough without hovering. It's a busy place, but the food came out quickly and was fresh, no heat lamp eggs!!"}
{"text":"How is it possible? What you may ask? To close a place and then reopen this many months and be better than what was already great. They did it and Rose (my server Rose was wonderful ) and they Have a lot of the servers back again. Well done and look forward to being a regular for years to come!"}
{"text":"Average at best. This place is good for Canadian style jerk chicken. I like mine more spice. The price is reasonable and the food seems to always be fresh. I love their king fish pieces but always go in to pick the pieces you want. I will return because my daughter loves this place but am always on the hunt for the best jerk in town. Since Gary's closed I have been lost for the true flavor of spicy jerk."}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! Food is great, staff know us by name. #1 in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time. Bought a take out dinner. Got the jerk chicken dinner w/ rice & peas & a little Cole slaw. They forgot the peas. LOL  The jerk chicken was EXCELLENT! Tasty & filling. Cole slaw tasted great & was fresh. A little 'watery' @ the end. Rice cooked perfectly. Had some Ox tail sauce put on. Tasty too! Definitely going back. Store could be a little more tidy if I really had to complain. Maybe next time I'll get to try the peas. ;)  Still a 4 of 5 is pretty good."}
{"text":"I passed this place for over a decade on my way home from school and work seeing it's right near my house so I decided to finally try it. Sadly, I was disappointed. I think another person on here review said \"if you're back here for a second visit, you should get your tastebuds checked\". I would have to agree with him.                                                              THE REVIEW  Ok so this place has a nice southern small restaurant vibe to it, which I like. I did notice probably all the servers were nearing the elderly side. Nothing important, just an observation. I ordered the French toast and bacon with hashbrowns for myself and the pancakes and bacon for my sister. EVERYTHING HAD A BLAND TASTE. Not flavorful AT ALL. The pancakes were the worst part, almost tasting like warmable pancakes. The French toast was good though, nothing major. Hashbrowns were just OK, again not flavorful. Bacon of course is bacon so that was good. Grape juice taste like the box 0.99 grape juice at wal mart (I'm confident that it is). The syrup my God, was extremely watery. If you're into that you'll like it but I like mine thicker and simply not a water consistency.   Waiters were very nice, she seemed to forget a lot though. Even bringing me utensils when my food came and I had to wait 3 min until I flagged her down. Again, still was nice though. The money value is nice also, very cheap. But that old saying \"you get what you pay for, is true in this instance\"."}
{"text":"I will always love their rice and peas & coleslaw but their cheapness with their meat is just getting downright annoying. I ordered a large fried chicken meal and got two little pieces of chicken with hardly no meat on on them. It's quite confusing why they started doing this when they never use to do that 12 years ago?. The whole meal was basically rice. Their chicken roti was pitiful as well. If you want good roti go to The Roti Shop on Kennedy Road in Brampton. They know what their doing. I would love this place and give it a full five stars if they could just give out the meat that should be on par with the size of order."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Food is very consistent always seems a little better than the other similar places around here. The one thing I like is that they know how to fry an egg over medium. I know it is a simple task, but 75% of the time at other placed you end up with runny whites or over cooked yolks, not here, eggs are right every time. Haven't tried lunch or dinner in many years, but it used to be good. I think I will try it soon."}
{"text":"We've been twice now for breakfast and really love this restaurant. The breakfasts are traditional and very good. We haven't tried lunch or dinner yet but this will definitely be our new go to breakfast spot. Prices are amazing."}
{"text":"Ive been here three times now. Everything was delicious all three times. Servers are top notch. Attentive and fast."}
{"text":"Places like this are a dying breed which is a shame because I absolutely love it here. I've been going to Charlotte 2 to 4 times a year for about 6 years to visit one of my best friends and there hasn't been a visit where I haven't gone to Sunrise. I love all the booths and I've never had to wait for a table. Among my favorites are grits, biscuits, baked spaghetti, peach cobbler and real sweet tea! I don't drink coffee but my friends really seem to like that too. The servers are friendly, the food is good, the menu is large, you can eat breakfast ANY TIME and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been to Sunrise (according to the original review, it was a whopping nine years ago that I reviewed them). This new location is certainly a lot, well, newer. The downside is that everyone, their brother, their mother, and their neighbor is now visiting.  Where the old location was a bit dark and made you wonder a bit about the place, this new one is certainly bright and airy if nothing else. It has plenty of seating. Despite being what appears to be rather small, it has plenty of seating, yet is constantly packed. They have been open for a couple of weeks in this spot and yet the lot is regularly full - breakfast, brunch, lunch, even at odd times where you would think they wouldn't be busy.  It could be that the lot just isn't that large, or it could be that they really are that busy. I don't recall the old location having that many people in it at any time.  Regardless, it's great to see that they are so busy, but it's a bit of a bad thing if you're wanting a fast meal, because it's going to take you a while to get in simply due to the wait.  The good news is that once you're in, the service is fairly quick, and despite all the traffic, they don't seem to have a problem either fulfilling orders (they aren't running out of anything) and they don't have a problem getting it to you either (plenty of places have an issue delivering if they are busy).  Now there isn't anything fancy here - it's essentially a diner - but if you can get in, and you're craving a diner, it's a nice new location and perhaps worth a visit."}
{"text":"These days it seems like there are fewer and fewer of the old-style restaurants around, and more and more of your typical fast-food joint, which on one hand makes it less likely that we'll visit a place like the Sunrise Restaurant.  On the other hand, there's probably a reason for that.  The staff at the Sunrise has to be caught in a good mood, and later in the day is not a particular good time, at least from what I've seen of them.  They can be nice, but that's probably a rarity.  The menu is not an exercise in simplicity.  It's one of those things where you have a choice of just about anything and everything you might possibly want, and that could be bad.  The food itself isn't bad, it's just that you have to figure out what it is you want.  It's served quickly enough, and fresh enough, it just isn't anything outstanding."}
{"text":"Our first time dining at this restaurant yesterday.  Was surprised it was not busy for a Saturday night but was informed that most of their business is busiest at breakfast time.   Got seated immediately and promptly had a nice waitress take our drink orders. There is an abundance of menu choices!  We all ordered something different and each of us enjoyed our meals..nothing fancy but good food. Wine servings are very generous too. I had the flounder which was done perfectly.  Manager checked on us to see if everything was to our satisfaction and our server was readily available and attentive.  I would definitely return to try another dinner item."}
{"text":"I eat here often. At first look the restaurant may seem or look a little unappetizing to some but that is so untrue. Sunrise reminds me of Mel's diner from the show Alice, if your old enough to remember that show. The staff is very pleasant an the restaurant has a nice welcoming atmosphere. I usually get the double cheeseburger with fries or the turkey club with fries. Both are excellent IMO and always right. They have a decently priced grab and go breakfast deal I get sometimes. It's best you call on the way so it's ready when you arrive so you can just pay and be on your way."}
{"text":"If you're back for a second visit, please get your tastebuds checked. I was so disappointed in this place. You'd think a hole in-a wall \"southern style\" breakfast place would be amazing, right? Great prices... that's about it. Eh."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Charlotte hands down!!! I usually get the bacon omelette with cheese...side of hash browns with biscuits...can't to wrong with that...the place is always busy (indicator the food is good) so either call ahead or be prepared to wait a few minutes before you eat BUT it's worth the wait!!! ALSO CAN CALL TO ORDER AND PICK UP!!!"}
{"text":"Such good food the biscuits hash browns grits and sausage links are so good. Service was amazing too would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Nice homey place.  Good breakfast and coffee.  Wonderful waitress.  Bathrooms are clean, but could use some updating.    Came in again looking for a nice thick juicy cheeseburger and fries.  Unfortunately I didn't find it.  Flat burger could not have been more than 4 ounces, fries were tasteless.  I like the place, butI'll stick to breakfast. Nice waitress"}
{"text":"I'm an UP & AT EM kinda early (6am -7am) kinda guy. I took my son with me a while ago (see pictures........ NEED I SAY MORE???    GOOD PLACE... family owned, operated.  I have nothing bad to say about the place....  TIP... ask for Fish (I think flounder or perch) for breakfast if you're into that kinda thing. I don't believe its on the Breakfast menu!!  Cheer's"}
{"text":"The new restaurant is beautiful! It's huge, clean, fresh, and busy! The place is decorated nicely and everyone seems happy to be in the their new building. There seems to always be a line when you come, so be prepared to wait. The staff is friendly, but can get pretty backed up with the huge crowds, so maybe not as attentive as they would hope to be.  The food is the same for me, it's not my favorite. And not to say there's anything particularly wrong with it, it is just average for me. I ordered poached eggs with my breakfast, which were for sure not poached. They looked poached, but were completely done inside. I didn't really mention it because they were so busy at the time.   I would maybe come back, because my mother loves the place, but probably not on my own, and definitely not somewhere I crave."}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable.  The service is always good.  However, I never like my food! It is always greasy and flavorless. I tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just \"ok\" diner food.  I wasn't sure what the hype was all about so we went to check it out this weekend.  The hot cakes were nothing special, they were a little hard (IHOP might have better pancakes, and I'm not a big fan of them either).  The omelet was ok, I tried the gyro omelet.  My husband got egg whites with cheese and that was probably the best looking and tasting thing that we got at our table.  Hash browns were a little cold, and biscuits were cold and hard...I didn't bother to finish mine.  So nothing special, just another diner spot with \"ok\" food.  But there are some other breakfast spots in the Charlotte area we would consider before coming again and waiting 30 minutes on this one.  At least we tried it out."}
{"text":"After passing by this place almost everyday I decided to stop by. I ordered the fried pork chops, black eyed pees, and collard greens to go. The corn bread (comes with every order I believe)excellent as well. Everything was delicious and affordable. Very large portions enough for left overs if needed. The manger was very helpful and extremely nice. I will definitely be making my way back here!!"}
{"text":"They're back & better than ever. The food's as good or better and the service is 1st rate with much of the staff from the previous location returning. The facility is clean, bright and spacious with an open feel to the dining area.  It's like having an old friend return after a long absence. Welcome back!"}
{"text":"Even after closing and reopening the food is just as delicious as ever! We liked everything we ordered with no complaints. Portion sizes and prices were amazing. I'm glad they are back open and closer to us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when sunrise moved into the plaza by my work. I could have real home cooked food instead of tim hortons or Starbucks when I don't bring a lunch. The food at sunrise is good I can't deny that. I usually go for breakfast (Ackee and salt fish) and it always hits the spot. Then I wash it down with their peppermint tea. Perfect breakfast on a winter day. HOWEVER, the customer service here sometimes is laughable. I don't know who the manager is but you really need to send it some secret shoppers because I've had a few unpleasant encounters with the cashiers that look like they hate their life. There is just a level of professionalism that is not there. I love supporting black business but I don't go to sunrise half as much as as like to because of the service.   Example, this morning I came in and ordered Ackee and salt fish and specifically said no banana just dumplin. I saw her taking a banana out the pot and reminded her (as nicely as possible) that i didn't want banana. She then whispered to her co worker \"didn't she say no banana\". Like really your going to talk about me right in front of me? And I heard her kiss we teeth at someone. Like get it together. And it would hurt anyone's face to smile. I'm not saying everyone there is like that but I'm not the first to complain about the service and I'm definitely not the last. Most of the people at my work feel the same."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Sunrise Restaurant. I came here with my co-workers who were in the mood for some breakfast. I was not very hungry so I ordered a bowl of grits. My co-workers ordered omelets, pancakes, sausage, bacon, etc. Everything looked good. It definitely made me wish I was hungrier lol.  The restaurant was crowded, but there was plenty of room to maneuver around. It was good to not feel like we were sardines in a can.   My bowl of grits tasted AWESOME! I know most places can make decent grits, but I really liked those a lot. My co-workers enjoyed their meals, as well. They all said they'd come back again.   The price... omg. For all 4 of us it was a little over $20. This place was very affordable. You don't find that too often, especially of this quality.   If you have the opportunity to go here, do it. I think you'll enjoy it."}

{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here today and my wife loved the chicken. She also had the vegetable soup, which she does not normally like and she ate all of it. I had the roast beef sub and it was really good. It was extremely busy and they appeared a bit understaffed, but all things considered all turned out well."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and huge portions.  Loved the place.  We had the spaghetti, breakfast and hot turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Quick and Friendly service. Breakfast was very good- grits were exceptional. Reasonably priced and large variety on menu."}
{"text":"Shopping local and therefore eating local, I hit up the Sunrise while I was a few doors down waiting on my car to be tinted. A nice family-run restaurant with all the comforts of short-order cooking and unusual specials. I opted to go with the month's special, a baked spaghetti dinner that came with garlic bread and a salad. The salad was typical mass produced, but the lettuce wasn't damaged with freezer burn and the thousand island dressing seemed to be freshly made. The spaghetti was piping hot and had a good amount of sauce that I chased around with the last of the garlic bread.  Good service and a very filling meal. It kept me going for several hours!"}
