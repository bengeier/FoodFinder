{"text":"We had a phenomenal night at Nico's. The only only only reason it's not 5 stars is that my lasagna was a little salty for my preference and the meatballs didn't seem as good as they were priced. The ambiance was fantastic, the service was excellent shout out to Penny, and above all we made a great memory here with some close family. The calamari was perfect, the Brussels sprouts were unreal and their well gin is superb. Thanks Penny, and thanks Nico's"}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch here with my wife and the food was fantastic, the service was exceptional and everything exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back to try out their dinner menu. So glad that this restaurant is in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Starting to wonder if there are any choices at this place that aren't superb.  Last night we had the octopus appetizer - wonderful.  Shared the lasagna and scampi and both were over the top.  Did I mention excellent service??"}
{"text":"We showed up around 9:40pm, not realizing that their closing time was at 10pm. You would never have guessed it from the behaviour of the staff - they treated us as if they had all night to wait on us. Our server, Aaron, was exactly the right balance of friendly, engaged, and efficient without being overly enthusiastic or annoyingly intrusive. Octopus, and grilled wedge salad were very good. Calamari was extremely good!  Shrimp scampi was bland, almost as if they forgot to season it. Overall, the experience was very positive and I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with our 3 boys for brunch. Not very impressed with any of the meals we tried: steak and eggs, lemon pancakes, French toast and the traditional breakfast. You can get a much better tasting food at one of the many other local breakfast restaurants for less. We won't be back for breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"Nico is locating in a charming area in downtown Gilbert. I met my parents here for lunch on a weekday. I had the octopus which was incredibly tender and flavorful - probably the best octopus I've ever had. Our server was not very attentive and kept forgetting things my dad had requested, but a gentleman who I assume is the owner was extraordinarily apologetic and very proactive in correcting the server's errors. The food and ambiance were fantastic and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sorry, not impressed with the overall experience. Food was OK, but portions are really small. I felt we needed to order something else after we finished our entree. The canolli was good though. Not the experience I expect from a nice Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Dear Nico's, the first 2-3 weeks you were open, the service, food, attitude of wait staff was amazing. The menu prices are not easy on the wallet. But ever since I have been routinely disappointed. We came today and order from the brunch menu, steak and eggs. Menu stated with garlic fries, only problem is there was no garlic on the fries. Should I mention the wait staff, despite having empty drink glasses, did not ask if I wanted anything else. In addition, I asked the wait staff advice on a drink, and was told that if I did not like it, she would switch it out for free. Despite this offer, when I expressed my displeasure in my drink, no replacement was offered. In addition, at one time the bar tender came for my opinion, i offered a not so positive review. Response was essentially, so sad too bad. I will never come to your place of business ever again. SO much potential, yet no avail."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly, but the service was extremely slow. I would let that slide, but it was not at all busy. It was 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. The food portions were small considering the price. Overall, nice atmosphere, but mediocre food and poor service."}
{"text":"The evening began with a selection from the list of craft beers while we perused the menu.  Our server, Nathan, was knowledgeable and provided enough information to make an informed decision without making us feel rushed. He made great suggestions describing the dishes in full detail.  We started with the burrata and tuna crudo.  The burrata was amazing and bettered any we have had in our travels.  The tuna crudo was tasty with the tuna of the highest quality.  There were no salt or pepper shakers on the table nor need for them; the food was seasoned to perfection.  We shared the 2 starters between 3 of us. The burrata was easily shared by 3, the tuna crudo best suited for 1.  My daughter and I selected the pasta; she the campernelle pasta with porcini & sausage ; I with the paperdelle with short rib ragu. Both were amazing with my only slight criticism that the pasta was slightly overcooked.  The draw for the evening's selection of Nico's was the wood fired octopus.  The wood fired octopus was my wife's easy choice and one of the best dishes she has eaten in years.  Poached in white wine and grilled over wood, the sear and slight char made the dish amazing.  She was equally pleased by the accompanying salad.  Having been open only 4 days, we were pleased to have busboys ask how we enjoyed our food and were able to discuss the menu and ingredients.  The number of restaurants in downtown Gilbert is increasing monthly, to the benefit of locals! We are truly thankful to have such a gem in Nico Heirloom Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight. No need for a long review. Extremely overpriced and service is very pushy to up sell to uncomfortable levels. If one time customers is all you are looking for then by all means keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place...Gilbert has a cool vibe and this was on the strip....service was decent (Waitress was kind and tried to help) and the decor welcoming BUT the drinks my friend ordered were out of stock and then come to find out mine was out as well. Not cool! AND...no bread is served with the meal...really? It's an Italian restaurant is it not? That was disappointing...the food itself, wow total disappointment. The noodles were almost too el'dante and the sauce was tasteless and bland. It was suppose to have basil and garlic in it and I never saw or tasted anything besides tomatoes. Chef Boy Ardee does a better job and I dislike that stuff. Based on this visit, I wouldn't go back for the food, and happy hour was seriously lacking anything interesting also...so overall, I guess I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian!  We've had two meals here and both have been very good.  The Octopus is a great starter, the salads are tasty and I craved the dressing the next day.  The steak options are OK, but go for the Italian dishes and you won't be disappointed.  Great food and outstanding service, even after closing."}
{"text":"Awful addition to Gilbert and won't ever return. Went here for a moms group that I just joined in on last minute, and boy should I have stayed home. Perhaps I'm weird or don't care for a menu that is far too small in options and offers dishes you can barely understand, but this restaurant is far too over done for what they have to offer. The portions are unbelievably small for the price! Side salads are the price of a regular salad and offer NO meat. I ordered Spaghetti (only because it seemed like the most safe option). It was the size of a child's meal, and I wouldn't call it spaghetti, It was rather disgusting. I sent it back. This is after I waited an entire hour and a half for a half order of Spaghetti. Manager or owner came over and tried to offer me something else, but I couldn't help but think after everyone else wasn't pleased with their meal, what else I could possibly want? And also, what wouldn't take another hour to get. Then they tried to make it better by putting deserts on the table. I could have picked up better deserts from Bashas bakery. Servers took offense to everything, and were very rude and uneducated for their job. I've been in the service industry for over 10 years, and this is my very first Yelp or bad review I have ever left. Barrio Queen and Nico, I hope you make it, but you gotta step up your game, your food is not worth the money and more importantly, NOT worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this new restaurant in downtown Gilbert but we were extremely disappointed. We had called the night before and spoke with a manager inquiring about food choices (if it's possible) for my son who has many food allergies (which if they told us it will be difficult, we would have gladly just cancel our reservations - we would completely understand).  But we were told the chef can prepare some sort of grilled chicken, etc. and so we dined...Father's day brunch.  We were all seated at 10:55 a.m.  We immediately told our server about my son's allergies, she talked to the chef and told us what he recommended - chicken, veggies and potatoes.  We placed his order first at around 11:05.  She came back and we placed the rest of our order (probably around 11:10).  Long story short, we did not get our food until about 12:05 (after several times of asking) And...my son's (3 yr old) food came last!...when we ordered his ahead of all of us because for those of us who have toddlers, know they can not wait an hour for food to arrive.  When my son's food finally arrived, it was a huge white plate with a small piece of baked chicken (half of a breast with the wing) and a cup of fruits.  I asked what happened to his veggies and potatoes and our server just kept saying (as she had said for the past one hour) is it's coming.  I asked to speak to the manager (to give them an honest feedback since they are pretty new).  I told him what had happened and he really didn't seem to want to apologize at all but rather made me feel \"guilty\" as he said it took them a while to get my son's food ready because his is off the menu and told me that they had to prepare everything for him...the chicken, veggies and potatoes.    I told him I understand that but they could have told us that before we ordered and in fact, I also told him that we had spoken to the manager the night before and was never told that it will be difficult.  Again, we would have just gone to a different restaurant if we were told that.  Then our server told us because of the inconvenience, they took out the kale salad of the bill and my son's veggies and potatoes - which by the way, we never received the potatoes and the veggies they gave my 3 yr old son was a bowl of steamed red and yellow bell peppers! Now my son loves veggies but steamed bell peppers for a 3 yr old?!?!?  When I received the bill, the did take out the kale salad but charged us $12.00 for my son's small piece of chicken!  I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! Incredible Drinks, food and service. Gilbert finally has its first upscale dining. Try it for Brunch or Dinner you will not be disappointed. And the patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"We have been here three times and the food is great and the service is good. I felt like it was a little overpriced for what it was.  I like a restaurant that you can go to and enjoy yourself and not break the bank, but this is a little over priced.  If you have a special night out and you're OK with paying a little extra, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Loved everything about our visit. Reservations are recommended, but they were able to seat us right away. Host and hostess were very friendly. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu items. We started with the octopus with arugula salad,my husband had the flat iron steak and I had a pasta dish. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. The manager, Chuck was exceptional as well. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We went last week and as soon as we walked in from the back entrance door, the kitchen is on the right side and the walls have lots of windows so you literally see the full kitchen in action. One of the highlights was seeing the \"hatch-tag\" chef from The Next Food Network Star, Chef Matthew Grunwald, he appeared to be the head chef in the kitchen, which was very impressive. They had an off the menu Filet mignon special that day- phenomenal, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare!! I wish I would've taken pictures of our meals, it was simply delicious! We will go again, make sure you make reservations it gets busy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  It's my new favorite spot in downtown Gilbert. The food is different and delicious and the entire staff is so chill and accommodating.  You can tell they really care about the service and go above and beyond every time you're there. The menu has lots of variation so there's something for everyone and the presentation is always beautiful.  If you go for dinner don't skip the dessert!"}
{"text":"This place makes me wish I lived in Gilbert, just so I could order the butterscotch pudding every day.  I'm not sure what the actual name is, \"pudding\" just doesn't seem to do it justice.  Dinner was also amazing.  Our waitress was funny and helped us each picked something we'd like."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and wonderful food!! We had lots of courses and delicious Bistecca  The service was fast and friendly. The only downside was they ran out of the wine we were drinking."}
{"text":"This may be a little long, so I figured I'd add some highlights first:  * Great place to have an event * Lauren, their event planner, is one of the most professional, responsive person I have ever worked with * amazing food and great cocktails.    We wanted to have have our rehearsal dinner in downtown Scottsdale so we reached out to Lauren Ortez at Virtu (Nico's sister restaurant) to ask about their patio space.   After many very pleasant email exchanges we booked their patio space for 40 people. Lauren made sure all our needs were addressed from seating arrangements to kid's meals and came up with multiple options for our budget.   Fast forward to wedding weekend and the weather called for heavy rain the night of the dinner. After coordinating with Lauren on a plan B as their lower patio is uncovered, we decided to move the dinner to Nico.   The space at Nico was really warm and inviting. We live in San Francisco, so the space really reminded us of trendy restaurants we see there.   We had a 3 course prix fixe meal- I had the kale Caesar salad, flat iron steak and a dessert selection plate for the table. Everything is great and came out at the right temperature, which can be a challenge with large groups.   A few guests had dietary restrictions and they were able to accommodate the requests on the fly with no issues.   The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I was impressed.   Another great thing was that while the restaurant was packed, it was still easy to carry a conversation with guests. There was a steady buzz but the acoustics were great as it never got too loud.   Only drawback to Nico would be their lack of adequate restrooms. They only had 2 single-stall restrooms for the whole restaurant, which resulted in a consistent queue for dinner.   Overall, it was a fantastic meal and event. A big thank you to Lauren and the rest of the team for their great service and professionalism.   I would definitely recommend having your event here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful. Toby was are server/bartender twice I've been there, he is fantastic ! My husband from Brooklyn absolutely loved everything!"}
{"text":"The only reason they get two stars is because the service was superb. Our waitress, Kiana, was attentive, extremely personable and funny. She received a very good tip considering how awful the dinner was. The lasagna, supposedly beat Bobby Flay in his Food Network show. I can't believe this could be possible. Three of us ordered it and all three of us hated it. My husband eats anything and he only ate half. The Brussels sprouts were also hard and lacked flavor. The meatball appetizer was actually very good. Do yourself a favor - find another restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state and had a great meal.  The grilled octopus was fantastic.  The brown butter French toast was addicting.  The endless mimosas and Bellinis were a nice touch.  Service was on point.  Split the butterscotch budino with the table.  Perfect finish.  Ate outside, what more could a visitor want!"}
{"text":"Thank you very much to the crew at Nico for taking great care of me and my party of 15. We enjoyed an amazing brunch and bottomless momosa's.  Even tho we were a rowdy bunch with out a reservation, our wonderful server Michelle took great care of us. She had no issues splitting our checks even thought we kept switching seats. My friends and I were quite impressed. We will be back for sure!  Thanks again Nico!"}
{"text":"OMG...what a find!  Sophisticated menu, fantastic food, cool look...what could be better, and right here in Gilbert.  It was fun and tasty, as it turned out, to find some different and new choices on their menu. We went for brunch and the eggs were cooked to perfection. The staff as very friendly, prices were reasonable. It is worth it to pass by the regular downtown Gilbert restaurants [no that they are bad but they are not this level] to find this place.  We plan to return often!"}
{"text":"Went to propose to my beautiful fiancé  of two years and thank you chuck for a horrible evening.  After removing all water pitchers requesting us to buy bottled water for $4 for 16oz bottle and the bank provides them for free.  Having the staff fill individual glasses is ridiculous.  Constantly yelling at staff in front of guests is not acceptable.  I feel bad for the staff and surprised unprofessional behavior from management.  Thank goodness she said yes and will not be back,  I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Nico for brunch and dinner and wish we could eat every meal here. They have fantastic service and the food is so good we didn't want to stop eating. Their Cannelloni is the best I've ever eaten and the french toast is fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The chefs summer menu was awesome. The service was second to none. Well done"}
{"text":"We had brunch here yesterday. What an experience! The ambience is excellent, service impeccable, but the food. . .oh my God. I don't even want to share it, in that way that you don't want to jinx something special. We sat at the bar and our server/bartender was so congenial, really nice and playful. He made the experience even better. I'm embarrassed to say I never asked his name. It was obvious he loves the place and his job. He recommended the lunch home-made Rigatoni dish with slow roasted pork and the breakfast polenta with mascarpone and slow roasted pork. The portion sizes were perfect and the flavors and textures of each dish were tantalizing. It was not like when a place uses the same ingredient in something and it all tastes the same. The ingredients of each dish we had were skillfully balanced. We had a spinach salad to start. It was perfectly dressed (no dripping)with a home-made balsamic grape reduction and the exact amount of Italian gorgonzola, candied walnuts (not the overkill piles of stuff you frequently receive). The amount of sauce on the rigatoni was just right to let you enjoy each flavor. Back to our server; his knowledge of the establishment and the food was that of someone who really appreciates what he is a part of. Pretty refreshing all the way around!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! So happy that upscale dining has made its way to Gilbert! The octopus appetizer was amazing! I had the fish and my boyfriend had the duck, incredible! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best place in Gilbert. Every time we have been here every part of the experience has been perfect. Service always awesome. Food is amazing. Rarely do you find a spot that every aspect and detail of your dish is cooked perfect. Here it is. Favorite weekend breakfast spot now. Not packed and bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"This resturants food is so good! Service could be improved but overall just a great place!  The food is so fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work Christmas party and was not disappointed - every single dish that I tasted (appetizers, entrees and desserts) were all amazing. The staff was very professional and made it for a very memorable get together."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE dining experience. Uneducated servers, incredibly slow service (took an hour to get a salad), and purely self-indulgent food. The chefs clearly have a high opinion of themselves. Unfortunately, that opinion does not translate to the plate. When my companion with food allergies inquired what dishes would be safe for him, the server actually rolled her eyes as if we were inconviencing her by spending our money there. She then told him that dishes could not be altered because \"the chef is always right\" and if we asked for modifications to accomodate him \"perhaps we would be happier dining at a different restaurant\". What a joke. Shame on them. We will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"This is the best thing that has happened to Gilbert's dining scene. Everything about this place is exceptional - the food, the drinks, the service, the atmosphere, all of it. Whether you are going for drinks and apps, a sit down dinner, or brunch on the weekend, Nico's hits it out of the park! Favorites are the octopus starter, the simple salad, the bucatini pasta, the rigatoni, the cioppino and the steak (again, everything is incredible). The flavors are full bodied and the pairings are well intentioned. Each ingredient has meaning in the dish. Dining here is a must!"}
{"text":"We ate here Saturday night and the food was amazing! We had the octopus appetizer, chicken, sea bass, side of spinach, and side of potatoes. Finished it off with the cannoli! We will be coming back as soon as we can!! Defiantly a favorite"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and hang out with friends! We went on Sunday & had brunch. Delicious! And they have bottomless Mimosas and Bellinis! Also delicious! Good atmosphere. Server was awesome! All the waitstaff was great really. They made sure our drinks were not empty."}
{"text":"I recently went to Nico Heirloom Kitchen for brunch/lunch.  I've been to Virtu, a related Gio Osso restaurant, several times and loved it.  Virtu truly is exceptional.  With some exceptions, the same cannot be said about Nico.  First, the good.  The service was great, as were the cocktails.  We ordered the Virtu octopus, which is the signature dish at Virtu, and it was just as good as the octopus at Osso's flagship restaurant.  The octopus is a must have if you go to either.  Now the bad.  One person in our party ordered the lunch burger with fries.  The burger was overcooked, but that was understandable because the restaurant was noisy and the server simply didn't hear the order correctly.  That's an honest mistake.  The problem, though, is that I can't imagine that burger being anything more than mediocre even if cooked properly.  It simply was underwhelming.  Worse, yet, were the fries.  I've had better fries at fast food restaurants.  These fries were dull, colorless, and flaccid.  The plating was clumsy, too.  A large, shallow ramekin full of ketchup took up a third of the plate.  Ketchup is ketchup.  No need to try to class it up.   The other person in our party had the Nico benedict, which was good but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the BBL&T, which, like the burger, was underwhelming.  The bacon was too chewy and the sandwich was dry.    In sum, I'm sure Nico is a fine place to go to for some drinks and some good octopus.  Also, they serve the same brown butter french toast that is served at Virtu, which I've had and can say is incredible.  I've seen great reviews for Nico's version of the dish, so I assume it is worth getting here as well.  Overall, however, the food is disappointing.  Considering the wonderful experiences I've had at Virtu, I expected much more from Nico."}
{"text":"It is rare for me to review a restaurant, but I liked Nico so much, it was warranted! Everything was fresh and delicious! We had the burrata, lasagna and cannelloni. All were amazing! One of my new favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! From the warmed olives to the sticky toffee cake, every dish was delicious! Husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and started by sharing the small dish of warm olives (happy hour every day meant they were only $4!) and panzanella salad. I had a Nico Spritzer - also on the happy hour menu and just $6.   Then we moved on to the best grilled octopus I've ever had. Simply incredible and cooked to perfection!   Then it was the special of the night, fresh tuna served over garlic spinach and topped with a dried tomato pesto for the husband for dinner. The tuna was lightly smoked in the wood fired oven then finished in a skillet. So yummy!! I made a dinner out of two appetizers - the wood oven veggies and beef carpaccio. If everyone made vegetables like this, I would eat A LOT more veggies! A mix of eggplant, zucchini, tomato and other fresh veggies, this dish was roasted in olive oil with a splash of balsamic vinegar. It was like candy!! The carpaccio was incredible, served with arugula, capers and Parmesan cheese, and then drizzled with truffle oil. I savored every bite!   For dessert we shared the sticky toffee cake, which I would recommend. It's a dense chocolate cake, covered with a toffee sauce, brûléed bananas and an incredible whipped cream. So rich it was perfect to split.  And don't forget to try a caramel on your way out the door. They melt in your mouth and are a perfect way to end a perfect meal.  Although the restaurant was noisy, we had no trouble having a conversation. The service was outstanding, with our waiter being very attentive, but not stalker-ish, and highly knowledgeable about the menu. The tables in the back corner of the restaurant are in there pretty tight, so if you're at a table for two, you may have trouble leaving your table after a large party is sitting at the space in the middle of the aisle.  A great experience that I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First visit here. We came for late lunch date on Friday. Pretty much empty. Very nice ambient and rustic decor. We ordered burger and grilled cheese. Good, but not great. A bit on high-end price point. Service was very slow. Same complaint from couple sitting next to us. When I mentioned it took too long for food to arrive, server replied because they made everything from scratch - bad excuse. There was only 1 cook. We will not be back, other choices in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The service, excellent! The food, omg! The atmosphere, awesome!!! I love that they change their menu often. We've had the octopus, several pasta dishes, baked clams, burrata, flat iron steak, and many more items and every single one of them was so delicious. I'm so glad they're here in Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"Oh dear, where to begin? One of the most unsatisfying dining experiences ever. But hey, they just opened, and surely must be given a bit of slack, and time, to work out the kinks. Although my understanding is that this is not the owner's first rodeo. The noise level is oppressive. The service ridiculously over solicitous, especially since the wait time to receive our meal was extraordinarily long. Mains and over-salted salads were all delivered at the same time. The server needed to advise us when seated which items were no longer available before letting us review the menu. The bread was cold and greasy despite taking about 30 minutes to arrive (we thought they might have been baking it). The server needs to be either educated about the wine list or willing to say, I can't answer your question, let me send over someone who can. The pork chop, described as melt-in-your-mouth, was overcooked and dry and had to be sent back (we ordered a second octopus to replace it...that was tender as advertised). The crispy kale salad was just plain weird. The Branzino, which was served in place of Sea Bream, was nicely done. Please, when coffee is served, ask if one would care for cream and/or sugar, and a spoon would be nice. And please don't ask me how my food is looking. Yes, I know I am sounding a bit grumpy, but I did wait till morning to share my thoughts; had I written this last night I might have been even more critical! Good luck, Nico's, working things out. Maybe we just caught you on an off night."}
{"text":"So happy to have Nico in downtown Gilbert!! We were not disappointed in anything we tried.  Would pick the chocolate toffee cake over the ricotta tart. Sea bass was a home run. Hope you enjoy this as much as we did."}
{"text":"GREAT service. Most personal, professional service you will find in DT Gilbert. Food was very good and served beautifully.   The restaurant is very cool inside with huge mirrors and a nice size bar. Typically not as long of a wait as some of the other spots DT Gilbert but don't let that scare you off. This is one of our favorite spots downtown."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese with fig jam was awesome! Coffee was delicious and thoughtfully prepared. Chistorra and eggs were sublime.  This is a lovely little foodie hang in the most unlikely of places. Take the time to check this out!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  5 Stars for both of our entrees (rigatoni & lasagna) and 5+ stars for our appetizers (roasted asparagus & wedge salad) but only 3 stars for the creamed corn & potatoes w/onions...so a solid 4 stars overall.  My wife raved that the roasted asparagus appetizer was one of the best dishes she's ever had."}
{"text":"We came back for dinner as promised. Two of us split the grilled Caesar wedge salad and it was still plenty as a salad course. I wasn't terribly hungry so I decided to try the Spaghetti Pomodoro because it looked light.  Even though it's vegetarian and deceptively simple it's one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had - a deeply earthy and flavorful smooth tomato sauce with slightly larger-than-average perfectly cooked spaghetti. I don't know if the pasta was handmade but it certainly tasted as if it was. The tomato sauce was made with Chris Bianco's imported Italian tomatoes.  I couldn't quite tell if the earthiness came from the use of beef base or mushroom base in the sauce, but it was perfect.   My husband had the espresso-rubbed flat iron steak with dried cherry Demi and really enjoyed it as well. But oh, that Pomodoro. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had amazing food. Ambiance is nice and the bartender was super helpful for me to navigate the menu. I had the meatballs and stracciatella do bufala - Zabaglione for dessert  Gaja Promis red blend mixed well with everything I had... Loved everything. :) I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"These folks make really, really good grub. Excellent service from Kealyanna. Thanks  Apparently you have to write a long review to get posted; so, we'll list the items we recommend: flat iron steak, sea bass, chocolate toffee cake, olive oil cake, stuffed clams, and prosciutto & bread sticks. Enjoy"}
{"text":"The restaurant is so loud it's hard to have a conversation.  The sea bass is a very small serving, almost embarrassingly so. The pasta, tomato salad, and burrata were good. The tiramisu was served in a jar which is not conducive to sharing."}
{"text":"Wow! We recently tried this place for the first time - What an awesome experience. Everything was cooked to perfection. We had the  asparagus and octopus for appetizers, and sea bass for dinner. All excellent!! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tonight for the first time in my life I left no tip and regretted paying a bill at all. Despite an Open Table reservation we sat unattended for several minutes until the waiter told us he'd get water after the long, dirty table next to us was cleared as \"all the water glasses are there\". Some time later he came and asked what we wanted off the menu. I asked if he was taking drink orders or food and he said \"I'll do it all\". We ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees, then waited another 10 minutes to be told the bar was out of the bottom three drinks on the Craft menu. A reorder was placed by one of us and we got drinks...eventually and never so much as an offer to refill again.  When our salads came without the appetizer for my son, we waited until we could flag down the hostess who said she would check. No return. We flagged down our waiter...now with empty glasses all around and dirty plates who said he too would check. At 8pm...an hour after our reservation, my husband asked the hostess to check again what was going on and that we'd been asking to no avail. She said it was coming then walked away as he tried to explain that we kept hearing the same thing and were getting no service.  My husband left the restaurant and gave me his card to pay for the drinks as we knew it was going, shocking, even further downhill and that nobody cared.  I waited a few minutes at the table and when the waiter finally appeared with the shrimp scampi I asked for the check, which I got with a litany of excuses about how it was very busy and they weren't staffed. I sat in a half full restaurant with a hostess, bartender and at least 4 waiters reading a check for NINETY FOUR dollars. 4 drinks, 2 salads and an app that took an hour to get and I paid one hundred dollars...full price for every single thing.  Not one offer every to make anything right...just avoidance and excuses.   What a shame this place has gone so downhill. I know many people who used to go here weekly. I suppose the business will take care of itself if people continue to be charged these prices and leave hungry and neglected. There are just too many choices and a nice area in Chandler to go... not to mention Pomo next door where waiters are much more conscientious.   I'm posting this to help warn others, especially about using Open Table not to repeat the mistake. We surely will not as all my discussions with the waiter and concerns as I left were met with \"I know, I know, I'm sorry\" and nothing else. As former waiters we've never, ever stiffed a server...but I did so tonight and felt no remorse because we never got service. What I did do was overpay at a place that's more hype than service, which is a shame because the food was good. I hope something nice comes up in it's place or that the owner gets back to managing things. Perhaps he expanded too quickly."}
{"text":"Very uninspired service and food. We waited approximately 35 minutes for kids mac & cheese, and then another 10 minutes for cold food & incorrect order. I get it... things happen.... but the bigger issue is the fact a manager didn't come to at least offer an apology. They offered free dessert but... eh. Some places can get away with less than ideal service, but typically those places have phenomenal food.  In this instance, the food isn't good enough to make up the lost ground.  The look and feel of restaurant is great, but we won't be looking to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. This is a restaurant with an amazing chef and a beautiful menu.  It is all about the food.  It is not particularly big and all of the tables are pretty close together.  We have come here for date night, for family dinner with the kids, and for Sunday brunch.  They are able to accommodate a group of 8 quite nicely, but reservations are important.  When the weather is nice they have a patio which is great. The main part of this restaurant is the freshness of the ingredients.  It is really a stand out for the area in that respect.  We have a hard time not going back again and again for the brunch.  Everything is so delicious and an unlimited mimosa pour makes it all that much better! They will happily make my kids a traditional style breakfast of their choice even though it is not listed specifically on the menu.  Come to think of it, they do the same for the kids at dinner with pasta and butter and cheese. If you are looking for fancy service, this might not be the place.  I have never had an issue but want to stress that if you are looking for a wonderful, fresh, inventive menu, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Delish! Fresh and fine cooking! Octopus and calamari were to die for! Can't wait to come back with my husband. Great customer service as we had a large birthday party and the accommodated well to our crazy party! Thank you Nico employees!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing, leisurely lunch at Nico's Heirloom Kitchen. Service was so friendly, and our server made excellent recommendations. I cannot emphasize enough how badly you need the Brown Butter French Toast. We ordered one to share at the table (4 of us). It wad the perfect dessert. Also, the Virtu Octopus was amazing, perfect for lunch. Literally, the most tender octopus I've ever eaten.  My friends ordered and enjoyed the grilled cheese and the classic Benedict. So glad we decided to check this place out. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Who knew flank steak could taste SO Amazing? Tender steak with a cherry reduction is  Desserts are FANTASTIC! Service is always friendly and on top of every need.  Nice decor & atmosphere in the heart of downtown Gilbert. This is definitely one of our favorite date night spots!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The octopus is out of this world and the roasted chicken is the best chicken I have ever had... I brought my friends from Italy there this past weekend and they were in love I knew they would be! The atmosphere, the wine and most of all the food! You know a lot of love is put into these beautiful thought out dishes, def are fav restaurant and we will be back soon! If you are a foodie then u need to go!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails.  Great atmosphere.  Very pleasant waitress.  All the drinks we ordered were fantastic, very well crafted cocktails.  I ordered the lasagna which was a bit on the salty side, but had good flavor.  Great service throughout our meal and cocktail hour.  I would recommend this establishment to anyone I know, but would warn away from the salty lasagna."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough amazing things about this place. Gilbert's best hidden gem. The food, the service, the decor, the selection, everything is top notch here.   I have tried several things on the menu and nothing has disappointed yet. The pasta bolognese, the soups, the salad, brunch twice, the desserts are out of this world...the presentation is first class all the way. HH from 3-5 daily. Do yourself a favor and come see Michelle at the bar. Sweetest person in the world, and describes everything to you so you understand exactly what it will taste like.   Bottomless mimosas for brunch, absolutely amazing. One of my favorite places in all of Gilbert."}
{"text":"Decided to take my friend here for some happy hour, but we were bummed out to see that they changed their happy hour time..... still stayed and decided to give their regular menu a try and wow!! What a treat. Me and my friend decided to share three plates, their virtu octopus, grilled Caesar wedge and grilled salmon plate. Each dish gave us a satisfaction that we haven't experienced for a while. I especially enjoyed the urn wedge lettuce Caesar salad."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, for brunch on Sunday morning. The ambiance reminded me of having breakfast on the island of Hydra,Greece. The clean feel of the blues and whites and very modern yet cozy feel made for a pleasant dining experience. So much attention to detail went in to the setup l, from the perfectly placed stemware to the little sprigs of rosemary tucked into the linens. I brought along my 2 girls, ages 6 and 1. While I wouldn't say it's good for kids, (more for romantic/relaxing date nights) they had everything we needed: high chair, kids cups, etc. I ordered the steak and eggs, overeasy/med rare and my girls shared the Nutella crepes . Disclaimer: I am complete and total food snob, so when I say something is good, it's pretty friggin phenomenal. My steak and eggs were perfectly seasoned and cooked, I'm salivating now still thinking about it. And the fries underneath it all, soaking up the juices were so savory yet still crispy. A beautiful fruit bowl accompanied it, and not the lame fruit usually served as a side, it consisted of strawberries, blueberries, Granny Smith apples and Pears. Our server was Kealyanna and she was attentive and gracious. She even offered a linen to put under my purse so it wouldn't get dirty.  I will definitely be back to try the dinner service with the Mr. Thank you for such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, staff were all spot on. The food is worth coming back for and when you add on a friendly staff and a great environment to spend an afternoon or evening eating and drinking you got yourself a winner. \"I'll be back\" said in my best Schwarzenegger voice."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when in downtown Gilbert trying to decide on a place to eat. We tried 3 different entrees and all were delicious. We went there for lunch. The french toast was delicious. We also tried their caramelized onion burger with amazing garlic fries and house salad. All were so yummy. Service was great and atmosphere was classy and eye catching. We will be back."}
{"text":"I second many of the comments on here. The drinks and the service were great but the food left much to be desired. We went here for Restaurant Week and it was a good deal, $44 per person for a 3 course meal that included a glass of wine. There were two of us so we were able to try each appetizer and dessert offered and 2 out of 3 of the entrees. My Salmon cakes tasted fishy and were really salty. I don't even know what my husbands was supposed to be but it was weird. I had the cod entree, the vegetables were very good but the fish had absolutely no taste and was mushy. I only ate a few bites of each dish which is a rare act on my part. I don't usually like to waste food. My husband had the short ribs entree and it was dry and over cooked. There was a little redemption with the desserts. I had the beet panna cotta (yes I said beet) and despite being incredibly bizarre I enjoyed it. My husband's dessert was a peanut butter and chocolate ice cream concoction big enough for two people. I wouldn't go back especially since there are so many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"This experience was very disappointing. My husband and I wanted to try someplace new and I had been dying to try this restaurant for awhile now. Well let's just say we were disappointed.  First of all, we waited over 5 minutes for our server to come over to greet us and we watched him go three times to the table next to us before even giving us a thought. We could tell he was instantly disappointed that we didn't order drinks and his service never improved from there.  We ordered and our food was ok. Mine had good flavor but my husband's was just ok. The portion size is small and my husband was still hungry afterwards. The pasta was under cooked and very chewy. Not done al dente at all. Very chewy and kind of hard. The bread we were given was a weird consistency and not appetizing at all. When I received my meal it looked like there might be a meat sauce over it (I don't eat meat), so I asked the lady who brought our food over. She was irritated that I had asked and said No!, it is cheese :/.  The server only came back once to even check on us. And seeming he wasn't the one to bring out our food. I would say he had it pretty easy, we still gave 20% tip but he definitely didn't have to work for it.  The one thing I loved was the decor and ambience! Other then that.... we won't go back or even recommend this place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything ...breakfast was delish.We were served cold coffee but our waitress made it right! If your looking for some unique choices, give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Stumbled upon this place when planning to go to Pomo next door. Gorgeous space, food by acclaimed chef owner of Virtu, trattoria style food. Was everything I was expecting. Burrata was perfection! Service perfection! Dessert of nocciola flourless cake with house-made mascarpone gelato, perfection! I had parpadelle salciccia, and it was good, but not perfection like everything else. Flavors in sauce were there but pasta itself seemed too thick (and not melt in your mouth texture of house-made pasta!). Other than that a fantastic experience all around! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am by no means a foodie. I wanted to be adventurous and try something new, and this place was a much talked about restaurant by friends. At first glance the menu is intimidating, but Blair (one of the best servers I've had the pleasure of having in a long time) was very knowledgeable and was able to help me make a delicious choice.  I had the flat iron steak- the meat was cooked perfectly, the potatoes and onions were delicious, and the glaze was magnificent.   The only problem I had was seeing all of the other great looking dishes come out of the kitchen and not be able to try them all! If you're looking for something a little more upscale in downtown Gilbert I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for drinks after dinner down the street.  Even though it was almost closing time, the bar staff was very friendly and engaging.  They offered several different specialty drinks and didn't both making strawberry margs at all.  I would like to check it out for dinner one night.  The atmosphere was nice, dark and friendly.  Patio appeared friendly as well."}
{"text":"Very noisy. Metal chairs difficult to sit in for a complete dinner. Food & service very good, but not going back."}
{"text":"Oooo  maybe they were just having a bad day, but NEVER again. I went with a group of about 8 people, and it unanimous, none in our group would ever return.  Let me start with the facts. An appetizer and simple entree and it took us over 2 hours from start to finish. Service was SO SLOW. They didn't even take our dinner order until we were there over an hour.  They were maybe 1/3 full and I believe they wanted to keep us there so it looked like it was busier than it really was.   So for appetizers on the happy hour menu  we had the french fries ($5) for some greasy fries smothered in olive oil. It had some sauce which helped. I had the olives ($5) which was a small bowl of maybe 10 olives which I kept for my salad.  Wife had mushroom bruschetta ($6) for three small triangles of bread topped with mushrooms. Others has the sausage and peppers ($5) which was a small roll containing, yes wait for it, sausage and peppers. People seemed to like that.   We ordered our entrees when we finished our appetizers.  While we waited the 35 minutes for them I should mention the chairs. Half the group was on a nice padded bench, but I on the other side of the table got these blue metal chairs that were about as uncomfortable as I have ever experienced.    So we received the entrees. A Simple Salad ($9) for some lettuce leaves and dressing. Certainly it WAS a Simple Salad. The kale lover in our group ordered the kale salad. She thought it was horrible and returned it. We got the stuffed ravioli ($21) which at best had 6 ravioli just soaking in olive oil and it doesn't come with so much as a slice of bread. They serve it in a giant bowl and they certainly could stagger the ravioli so it looks like you are not getting ripped-off as much as you are.    After the meal maybe another 15 minute wait for the check. SLOW SLOW SLOW.  And I think for a place with this cost could at least provide bread or something for the table but nothing.    The one great thing about this place is there are other restaurants nearby which you will need, because unless you spend $100+ a couple at this place, you'll need to go elsewhere to actually get a real dinner.  This place is a joke. When my wife got the 5 raviolis for $21, we thought it was a joke, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Got the octopus appetizer and wasn't disappointed. Pieces of octopus were really tender and it had great flavor. Oddly enough, the texture reminded me of well cooked chicken.   I heard Nico's had great pasta but I didn't want something as simple as pasta pomodoro. I was intrigued by the Timballo, a pasta stuffed crepe. The outside was crisp and the inside was filled with pasta and ragu. I wish the pasta was more al dente. It was novel and good but not mind blowing.   My husband got the rigatoni, that had great al dente pasta with an earthy pork sugo sauce. Not very saucy but all the pasta was evenly coated.   Dessert was decadent and delicious, I'm glad we saved room. Sticky toffee with moist chocolate cake, topped with a refreshing marscapone gelato. Yum   We went on a Tuesday evening, not many people, great date location."}
{"text":"You had me at bottomless bellinis. Nico is by far the best brunch spot in the East Valley. Their brunch menu is nothing short of amazing, and it's served EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. And that includes the bottomless mimosas and bellinis for $10. I'm absolutely in love with the decor here, and the service is always on point. Justin was our server today, and despite being busy with other tables, he definitely kept those refills coming!   I've sampled most of the items on their menu, but the one thing I have to order each time is the Virtu octopus. I'll travel anywhere for food, and have made the trek up to Old Town for this dish on numerous occasions; but luckily it's available all day at Nico, and only 10 minutes from my house! The octopus is always perfectly prepared; it's smoky, flavorful, and super tender. They do not skimp on the serving size, either. I love the arugula and fennel salad that accompanies this dish too; it helps to cut the richness of the octopus and the chickpeas. If you're a fan of polenta, I highly recommend the pork ragu. The mascarpone polenta is decadent, rich and creamy; it's served with two fried eggs and grilled noble toast - not a light brunch dish by any means. My friend CP ordered the classic crepe and raved about it; he said it was the best crepe he's ever had. Oh, and do yourself and favor and order a side of bacon - it's thick cut and perfect. If you're more of a sweets brunch person, do not miss out on the brown butter french toast! I don't know what kind of magic goes into preparing this dish, but it's exactly that - magic :)   I've lived in Gilbert for 15 years now, and I love how downtown Gilbert has evolved over the past few years. Though there is quite a bit of competition out there, Nico is definitely the cream of the crop."}
{"text":"Pros: Great location. Beautiful and cosy interior. Not too loud. Friendly waiters. Great service. Loved the appetizers: asparagus, calamari, and especially the octopus (amazing). Cons: not impressed with my entree (sea bass) but maybe it was not a good choice. Entrees did not have a substantial side dish (mine was served with arugula and a piece of prosciutto), my friend's salmon was accompanied by a handful of greens. For the price of the dishes I would expect more. Lastly, it is expensive. We paid 350 dollars for a party of 7, that is before tip. We ate well, had wine and dessert."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Awesome happy hour, great service from the bartender, Ryan, & a great all around meal for a really decent price (4 drinks, 2 apps and 2 meals for $80) due to us being there at happy hour.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This has to be a \"must do\" in the Gilbert area for brunch.  Not sure what's better the food or the service.  This restaurant has and effortless execution that you can't get just any where.  So far have tried the  Mimosa Bellini French toast eggs Benedict (spicy) Meatballs  All were on point!"}
{"text":"Nico has a lot going for it and when it first opened I was concerned they might be in the wrong place to pull off a higher end dining experience.  I waited a while I come here admittedly because the menu just didn't call to me.   The menu has been changing and evolving and so we finally decided to give it a try.  We decided to do a bunch of smaller dishes because there were so many that really appealed to us.  We zeroed in on three dishes:  - Grilled asparagus with bacon candy, duck egg, and foie gras hollandaise - Burrata with prosciutto and balsamic grape jam  - Octopus with arugula   Everything was exceptionally prepared, flavored and presented.  High end ingredients and careful preparation really stands out at Nico.  It's true you do pay for it but when I put that burrara in my mouth my care for the price went out the window.  Oh my Lord that dish is sooooo good.  The duck egg on the asparagus was perfectly prepared and oozed golden richness that blended perfectly with the Hollandaise that made the dish so decadent.  The Octopus was as tender as I've ever had and later learned they use the old Italian trick of soaking in wine corks prior to preparation.  If you've ever home cooked Octopus and tried to make it tender you will really appreciate their skills here.    The service is exceptional and the bartender is right on the money.  He was fun to talk to, stayed close but never too far and always had our glasses filled.  He knew a lot about the food and drink and educated us on the menu and preparation.    What kicked my review from a tempting 4 star to a 5 star was while sitting at the bar we were admiring the prosciutto that was on the hand cranked slicer.  Every once and a while the chef would crank out an order and I am such a sucker for cured swine.  The chef or bartender must have overheard us and just dropped off a pile on a plate for us to enjoy while we finished our drinks.  On the house prosciutto ?!?!?!  Whoo Hooo  Last up are their prices which are a little high but they are worth it.  This is a nice \"treat yourself\" place for sure and we got out of there with dinner and a bottle of wine and several beers for less that $100.  Considering the quality, service, and beautiful restaurant, i'd say that is not bad.  At many places just the bottle of wine would cost you half of that.  hey do have some great wine prices on select bottles and even bottle prices and don't be afraid to go there - we tried two (Malbec and a Cab) and they are both solid.  They also have Fresh Squeezed IPA which is one of my favorite beers on the planet so nice job there.    Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. Truly a fantastic staff. It was packed full on a Friday evening so we sat outside on the patio. It began to rain a bit and the manager immediately rushed outside to open an umbrella. Our server refilled our drinks constantly. I was told the rigatoni is amazing so that's what I ordered. It was delicious but my only complaint is that it seemed overcooked and the veil chops were a bit too thick for my liking. I'll have to come back and try another dish. The service is what truly stands apart."}
{"text":"I went to Nico Heirloom Kitchen for Restaurant Week with a group of about 12. Our table was setup & ready to go for us as soon as we arrived. I had initially thought of just ordering something from their regular menu but was informed by our waitress that the Restaurant Week menu had specials which are not featured on the regular menu. I figured I couldn't pass that up so went ahead with the $44 deal.  The Restaurant Week menu included a glass of wine in addition to an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. I ended up getting a glass of white wine, the Gnocco Fritto appetizer, the Sogliola main dish, and the Bomba for dessert!  The Gnocco Frito was interesting in that it was listed as a dish made with fried pasta chips, crispy prosciutto, and lemon mascarpone drizzle. Most of us at the table got this option and thought it tasted like a a cream cheese rangoon. Kind of weird but it was crunchy & tasted ok.  I wasn't a fan of the Sogliola dish. The summer squash was good, I ate all of that but the fish was not pleasant. It was set on top of the agrodolce, and even though the menu said it was pan seared, it seemed like it was fried so the sauce made it soggy. The fish didn't have much of a flavor so I didn't have more than a couple of bites.  Fortunately, the Bomba was a good way to end the meal! I'm a huge fan of peanut butter gelato anyway so I was excited to see a dessert with this. The caramel center was thick & gooey and the whole thing was covered in chocolate! I wasn't able to eat the whole thing of course as it was a heavy dessert but I enjoyed it.  For this experience, I'd rate the restaurant 3-stars. I've heard fabulous things about their brunch menu though, so I've been meaning to go to that. I'll return here and hopefully have a 4 or 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Great place. They have really good Mediterranean/Italian fare. Very fresh ingredients. We did have a bit of an issue with a pasta we ordered (it was not al dente) and the food did take a little long to come out, but the staff immediately fixed it and Chuck went above and beyond to make things right. Octopus dish is their specialty and on a hot summer day it's actually really good, comes with a light refreshing side greens. Overall the staff was very friendly. The desserts here are to die for and their cocktails are really good. I recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I consider my self a big foodie. When this place opened I wanted to try it but never got the chance. So last night was my first time there.   I had reservations at 7:30pm. Upon arriving we were told it would be a short wait. At 7:45pm they still didn't have a table ready. Finally the manager came and said they are getting one ready and didn't want us to wait much longer.   About 10 till we were seated. Drinks were ordered. At about 8:15pm we got our drinks and ordered food. Food did not come out until about 8:45pm. So here it is almost 9pm when we are finally eating.   I gave this a 3 star review solely based on the service and would have likely given it 2 stars had the food not been amazing. So they redeemed themselves there.   Would I go back? Yea likely in the hopes that the service will be better next time around."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this restaurant.  I do, but the dishes we had were varied in execution. Let me detail.  Starters were a burrata with a tomato/onion \"jam\" with balsamic drizzle.  Tasty but could have used a sprinkle of coarse sea salt to provide a bit of pop to the dish.  Eggplant rolatini was tasty but could have used another minute or two in the oven. Filling was a bit cool inside and the eggplant could have bee a tad bit softer...so a bit underdone.   Wife had the octopus for a main...outstanding dish.  Tender and good counterpoint with the romesco sauce. Brussels Sprouts were OK, a but a bit underdone and under seasoned.   My main issue was the lasagne - I guess somewhat of a signature dish as it mentions on the menu a connection to Bobby Flay (?). So, in brief, WAY to long in the oven.  The topping was burned black, all around the edge of the dish, at least 1/3 the way to the middle, resulting in a scorched taste with just about every bite. I was somewhat disappointed to hear that the topping was white American/cheddar but couldn't taste to be sure as it was burnt.  Perhaps fontina since it's supposed to work Italian?  The pasta itself inside was tender but the ragu and layers also tasted scorched...so hard to judge. I ate it, but should have sent it back.   So, we have two under done dishes and one way overdone dish. The oven chef perhaps needs some oversight from the Exec.   Meatballs as a side we're OK but also suffered from being somewhat over fried, also somewhat scorched. They could have used a long slow simmer in the sauce, but not sure that would have dealt with the overdone crust.   Dessert was excellent.  A butterscotch budino. Yum.   As I said, I really wanted to like this place and will give it another try.  Perhaps it was an off night. If you're voted a Best New Restaurant, one would expect something better."}
{"text":"Oh, well. While quick to respond to my review and comment that Nico's  charged my credit card with a  $12 tip AND took my $15 cash tip with a promise to reverse the charge to my Visa - here it is, a week later and Nico's has NOT reversed the $12 they added to my UNSIGNED credit card bill. A $27 tip on a $60 bill was definitely not worth the food but it's worth the life lesson. I won't be going back! Walk down the street to Postino's instead! Save yourself the trouble"}
{"text":"We ate brunch here today and was once again really impressed by the food!  We've ordered different meals each time (we've eaten here 4 times over the past couple of months) to get familiar with the menu and each time have LOVED what we've had.  The steak and eggs and French toast were seriously delicious.  We arrived to a packed place (Sunday around 10:30am) which strained the staff a bit, but they handled it well overall.  Sitting by the large open doors with perfect weather was just wonderful and no doubt one of the reasons it was so crowded.    Brandon was our server, he was friendly and helpful, and gave good feedback on the menu items.  My only (minor) complaint was that I would have loved the Mimosa's refilled more often! But considering how potent they seemed to be, that was probably not such a bad thing anyway :) Highly recommended, we plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I LOVE, so much that this is a beautiful patio, brunch, bottomless mimosas, made me feel home again (home being 40th St/Camelback brunch, only I couldn't bring my boy there - so this is better!). Now for food & service...the staff was as nice to my boy as they were to me  and the food...was AMAZING! tho, at that point you could almost do NO WRONG!  You have my heart & palette Sean-pup's first brunch after losing his liter-mate, his twin brother, thank you!"}
{"text":"Spectacular.  Came here the second night they were open... couldn't tell from the service. Ran very efficiently. Upscale restaurant, but not in a snobby way.  We were able to bring our (well-behaved) baby and still have a great time without feeling out of place.  A bit more pricey than the surrounding restaurants, but you definitely get what you pay for. I had the BEST cooked scallops I have ever had. Ever. Anywhere.  And the staff was amazing."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and amazing food. Gio Osso is one of the best chefs in Phoenix. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Nico Heirloom Kitchen is extraordinary!!  It was our first time and wow!!  Started off with the octopus, clams, and meatballs - everyone in our little group enjoyed every bite...especially the octopus. So very tender and nicely complimented by the chickpeas and spicy arugula salad. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, but we ordered the rigatoni and lasagna.  The homemade pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauces spectacular. For dessert, the sticky toffee cake was heavenly and topped with their mascarpone gelato - worth every calorie!  The restaurant itself was so pretty and festive for Christmas. The staff was super nice and we can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Has some family and friends in town and decided to give this place a try... party of 8 for dinner on Friday night.  Ambiance - good! we ended up eating outside... and while the noise with the traffic and the music and the foot traffic was a bit much it worked with the weather and being outside  Service - good! It felt like there was a team of people tending to us and they were very engaging, knowledgeable, and responsive\  Food - this is where it was a bit of a let down... while the food was good (we had various dishes - Octopus appetizer, Burrata appetizer, Lasagna, Shrimp Scampi, grilled caesar salad, grilled salmon, kids meal... ) and we were told that this was a James Beard award winning restaurant and that the lasagna won is a Food Network Bobby Flay competition... it wasn't particularly notable. Let me put it this way... they had award winning prices... but not award winning food, per se. While it was certainly serviceable and wouldn't have sent anything back... it wasn't quite worth the prices - and would probably prevent me from coming back as it just feels as if you can... pretty easily... get better bang for the buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just hosted a girlfriend's bridal shower at Nico over the weekend and we had a fantastic experience from start to finish! The customer service is top-notch and the food was so yummy (they made an omelette for me even though there wasn't one on the menu and it was delish). I called around to a dozen places to host the bridal shower and I dealt with many places not returned my calls, poor customer service and/or outrageous minimums for hosting a shower. My first call to Michelle was wonderful and she assured me we could do separate checks, have a table for gifts, I could go in early to decorate and bring my own cake. She made me feel like I would be in excellent hands, which I was. I called a few days prior to the event to confirm and spoke with Chris, who is such  a gem. The day of the shower, Chris was so helpful and accommodating. Our server, Allison was also great and seemed totally unfazed by our large party and was overall such a pleasure. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time at Nicos. Went with friends for lunch to celebrate our birthdays. Very nice adult atmosphere, not noisy. Service was excellent. I had the octopus because I had heard so much about it. Our waiter said he had the octopus and immediately started working there. After I tasted it, I asked him for a job application. Our friends had the crepes and the Benedict. I tasted the Benedict and thought it was terrific... My wife enjoyed her crepes. They have a bottomless Mimosa/Bellini on weekends that is a terrific deal. I'm going back for more octopus. We are so lucky to have this restaurant in Gilbert!  Beware... went back again and my octopus looked like they were trying to fill up a plate with scraps. Disappointed with the octopus this time. The real problem was my wife had a hamburger and wound up sick in about 5 hours. Still sick 2 days later (recovering though) with what appears to be something from the burger. We won't be returning. Strange turn of events."}
{"text":"Don't know what else to say besides: wow. Chocolate toffee cake was the best thing I've eaten in my whole state of being."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing. Party at of 12 with reservations at 6:30.  The service was quite possibly the worst I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing.  Clearly the kitchen was understaffed and poorly trained. Each stage of the ordering process; drinks, appetizers, main course took much too long to orchestrate.  Nothing came out of the kitchen simultaneously so we had people finishing their meal while others were just being served.  Dinner began arriving at about 7:45. The table next to us became so disgusted they got up and left.  I wish we had done the same."}
{"text":"Gilbert, meet your best bet for special occasion dining. Although it's a bit more casual than its sister restaurant, Nico's polished style and menu set the tone for an elevated dining experience.  I love the interior because the brick walls make you think you're in an older building with lots of character rather than something that was erected a year ago. The crisp blue and white color scheme really pops too. I just wish they would add padding to the cool looking but very uncomfortable cobalt metal chairs.  Our group of four hit most of the menu sections. We had the snacks for a starter which consisted of thin breadsticks, light, crispy chickpeas and almonds that were sorely missing the rosemary mentioned on the menu. The signature dish, the woodfired octopus, was a hit at the table. My dad said he never imagined he would be eating fork tender octopus. My husband loved the chiles on the dish too. My mom and I got two of the fresh pasta dishes, the penne and spaghetti. The spaghetti was a knockout. Roasted tomatoes, just enough garlic, and parmesean that melted into the dish (I should mention all the food was served very hot which is awesome). My dad polished off his brazino as did my husband with his steak. We were about to throw in the towel, but my dad decided we should try the sticky toffee cake. It was pretty good, especially with the bruleed bananas, but we were dying for a second scoop of coconut gelato since the cake was dry.  One area that could use improvement is service. Our initial server, Penny, was good, but she attended to other tables as the night went out. The other servers were very slow to get out dessert and present the check. I was also annoyed that they kept asking if we wanted our water to be refilled. It's summer in Arizona, and the glass is empty. What do you think? Hopefully that will work itself out in the next few months."}
{"text":"Got seated, then ignored. Reviewed the menu and decided what we would order. No contact for drinks. We expect to order drinks while we review the menu but no contact. So, I set my timer for 4 minutes. I think we reviewed the menu for 4 or 5 minutes conservatively. So after the timer that's 8-9 minutes of no contact. Set my timer again. After 4 more minutes we walked over to the Barrio Queen and had a great brisket burrito.  Menu looks good. I'm not sure what 'sagu' is but then again I never had the chance to ask. The prices are a bit high but the items read like they could be worth the price.  Table had a nice string tied napkin with a sprig of rosemary.  Good luck Nico!!"}
{"text":"We love this place especially since it's closer to us than Virtù! The food is amazing, we always get the octopus because you can't go wrong with that. The chicken is done to perfection and don't get me started on the lasagna, it was beyond heavenly. Don't forget to save room for dessert we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was delicious...I am dairy and egg free and the chef made a special dairy free pasta on the whim with fire roasted veggies and sausage that was absolutely amazing. We had the octopus for a starter and I had the roasted duck done dairy free and it was so good. We have lived in a few major cities around the U.S. And it was one of the best dinners we have experienced. We had Nathan as a server and he was so good... Grace is there too and she is also wonderful! Can't wait to try their brunch and we will be back for dinner soon!!"}
{"text":"Words cannot express the magnificence of each and every entree the boyfriend and I had. We started with carpaccio & arugula as well as asparagus with candied bacon and duck egg sprinkled with some kind of wonderful I have never known.   I had the pappardelle pasta with pork sugo... This was the freshest pasta I have ever had. How am I supposed to go back to the rest of my life having boxed pasta after this experience?   Boyfriend had flat ironed steak with fingerling potatoes, miniature white magic onions and a balsamic glaze that made our eyes roll to the back of our head.   But wait there is more.... We went all the way, I mean alllll the way. We finished off the night with chocolate toffee cake. I love chocolate, ice cream and toffee... This dessert had it all.   The ambiance of this place is inviting you can hear the excitement of people sitting at nearby tables. There isn't loud obnoxious music playing overhead. Just the joyful chatter of patrons and the occasional bang of a pan in the kitchen. The staff is professional from start to finish, this place has my vote.   This isn't a taco or pizza joint the menu is upscale the portions respectful. If you want to have an experience or impress date, client or out of town guests this is the place to go.   Penny our server made this a memorable experience. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We brought my MIL here for our first visit on Saturday. This is a nice upscale addition to Gilbert Road's restaurant area! We took our time with our meal and all of it was delicious - from the bread to the octopus to the entrees. The music was a little loud for conversations, but not so bad that it was an annoyance. I do feel like they went a little overboard on the size of the furniture and the middle support area in the restaurant as it's hard to get around tables that are full. Because we took our time (we were there over 2 hours), I felt the chair I was in was a little uncomfortable at the end, but only after being in it for over an hour and a half did I feel that way. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Before I begin, I did not want to come to this place, I was in the mood for Mexican, but the wife had other plans. Let me tell you, this place did NOT disappoint.  Not only was the food amazing, but the service was on point. We sat at the bar because the wait for a table was far too loooong. The bartenders were very attentive and answered all our questions. Shoutout and kudos to Michelle.   I recommend the Lasagna and the Ceasar Salad. Lastly, I was told they have an amazing brunch. The wife and I will definitely come back for that. Standby for a review on that.   This place is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"Dined there last night and was dissatisfied with the food and service. In the beginning the server was very attentive, but as the meal progressed she was not visible. We had missing utensils, empty glasses and questions. I ordered the Famous Octopus. Everything on the plate was soft, no textures, bland flavor and needed some acid to heighten any flavor besides pepper. My clam dish came with pasta, grilled bread and beans . Way too starchy and dry. Who serves pasta with 2 more starches??? Anyway I had to ask for a side bowl to put my shells in. I could go on with my dining partners meals but I had enough, just like my meal. I was really excited to try this place. Should've went to Pomo next door."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. My mother and I just walked out of this place.  The host seated us and we waited for a good ten minutes. I see a server with pink hair point towards us to the manager then I see the manager point in our direction to the host and to other employees. Meanwhile, I'm confused because we were told we can sit there. Eventually the manager walks towards us to bring us water and I asked if everything is okay. He says he just wanted to make sure someone will be able to serve us. Not sure why it's a problem when pink hair server is serving people to our right and left. Waited another ten minutes and no one comes to take an order so we eventually walked out and got some delicious food at Evens Stevens. Not sure what all of the treatment at this place was about, but definitely an uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"The first thing I can say about this place is the customer service was awesome. Everyone pays attention to the details. We ordered two appetizers and once we were done a staff member was there to take the dishes right off the table. Everyone there worked as a team. If the staff walked by and saw you were finished somebody grabbed the plates and cleaned up the table.  Those little things go a long way. You could tell that the staff was trained right to notice and pay attention to the details.    The food was excellent. We ordered a pasta dish and the filet for the main course which we shared. Server said the chef recommended medium rare And steak was cooked perfect. The ambience was nice. Reminded me of restaurants back east in Boston with the redbrick on the walls, way the bar was open up to the whole place."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in the area! The lasagna from the Bobby Flay challenge was incredible, I crave it every day! The cacio e pepe too. Amazing! And such a fun atmosphere too. I love trying new restaurants, but part of me wants to just come here for every meal."}
{"text":"all the food was peppered up something fierce (Me being a polish scum bag, I don't know if this is traditional Italian food or not) Either way, it was good as hell. Our waitress seemed like she had never served grub and drinks a day in her life, but she was nice so it was all good. It was a little more dressy than I expected, so I am sure my oversized \"Worlds Greatest Grandma\" tank top stained with mustard and beer wasn't the hit of the night. I saw the owner look over every plate that came out. So that's cool.  All in all, hell yeah."}
{"text":"Had the Sea Bass, which was buried under a bunch of arugula. Fish was good, presentation wasn't.  Rest of the family wasn't very impressed.  Chefs seem to just invent their own dishes and give patrons very little choices. Won't be back again, was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Our visit here was not expected today but I'm glad it happened. Our original meeting place to catch up with our wedding planner was so packed that we decided to give this place a try.   Ummm $10 unlimited mimosas/Bellinis! Correction - almost unlimited. I think that's what the menu says because there's a limit of 10.   My fiancé went with the Nico Benedict and it looked so pretty. I wish I got a better picture of it quite honestly but he was sitting diagonally from me at the table. He said it was really good and would get it again. I went with the Pork Ragu with a over medium egg (there are 2 eggs). I was a little sad because one of my eggs was well done, not runny at all, like completely solid... but hey, I got one runny egg! My dish was very aggressive for brunch. I think it would be better for lunch.   Our wedding planner went with the French toast and that dish was amaze-balls. She shared a slice with me and it was pretty yummy. I'm getting that the next time we are there!   Wish we had more time to enjoy ourselves there (and possibly try dessert because of my sweet tooth) but we were running a bit late to another appointment.   We'll be back the next time we're in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Wow! I've now been to Nico Heirloom Kitchen twice. I keep looking for an excuse to go back again. We loved all of the festive and tasteful décor, with Christmas music playing in the background. It really felt cozy and made it feel like Christmas was coming.  Every time I go, I am always extremely impressed with the knowledge that the wait staff has. whether you're asking about cocktails, wine, or the food, they are vastly aware of every last nuance. They make the experience truly enjoyable with the information they provide you with on every dish. Sometimes your waiter is the one making your cocktail too, which is cool! We started with the octopus. You will NOT believe it's octopus. The preparation is incredible from the texture to the taste. It's unlike anything I've ever had and I have to order it every time I go.  Our entrees included the Spaghetti pomodoro (with an added meatball), the lasagna, and the rigatoni. The freshly made pastas really make each dish shine. Lasagna has notoriously been one of my more disliked foods, but THIS lasagna is just...so beyond lasagna! I crave this lasagna! The Spaghetti noodles are thick and cooked perfectly al dente. The rigatoni with pork sugo and house made ricotta was rich and decadent. All 3 of us licked our plates clean.  I can't wait for a good reason to go back. I love taking out of town guests here. My new favorite restaurant in Gilbert, and the Phoenix Metro Area! Sorry I didn't take pictures...everything was gone before I even thought of it..."}
{"text":"I went here with the hubby for a special night out. We went on a Monday night and the restaurant was very empty. The atmosphere is sophisticated and beautiful. We sat inside but the garage style doors were open so the fresh air was perfect.  Our server was attentive and very helpful.   We didn't try the cocktails but we definitely will next time, they look great. The wine list was good and we enjoyed the pinot noir. To eat we started with the octopus which was amazing. I don't usually eat octopus but this was delicious and full of flavor. Next came the lasagna which was good but extremely rich.  We could have split that and been done but finally came the dinner. My husband had the veal and I had the steak. Both were very good and perfectly cooked. We had to take a lot of it to go because we were stuffed!    This is a great choice for a special occasion. It is way too pricey for the average night out but worth a splurge.  Overall we really enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"We went to dinner with two other couples and this place came highly recommended by someone within the party.    The ambiance is nice.  It's got a lively feel with upscale decor and a big bar. The food is designed to be shared and brought out in several courses. We obliged and took part in the process.   The food was pretty good. We each had a cocktail, then ordered a salad, lasagna, flank steak, then a dessert. Definitely was full after the 2.5 hour meal, and also ready to get moving.   It's a good restaurant, but nothing mind blowing. Their portions are decent, however the process is quite long. Definitely recommended for a nice dinner with friends, however it is on the expensive side and with several other good options in the area, I can't say it's the best.  Overall I would go back, but not as frequently as other places around there."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Fresh and unique flavors.  Beautiful atmosphere and top notch service.   Best kept secret in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"What a little treasure in the dessert! Great ambience, clean, and you can see into the kitchen! Greeted as soon as I entered the restaurant and seated, I was waiting for a few friends. They showed soon after and we were offered bottled water that is sitting on the table. We opted for cocktails instead! I had the sprinter, very refreshing! Our waiter was a mature gentleman and was very kind and took our order and answered our questions. I got the papelle with pork, it was delish and very filling. We split a dessert that was Awesome!! Some molten chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream on top. We sat there a half hour after they closed and they never once gave us the evil eye, or tried to rush us off, I'm sure they were glad when we did leave!"}
{"text":"For taste good but I got sick. I was sick after eating here for the second time. I have been sick for three days now.  First time I didn't get sick but time it was bad"}
{"text":"We are so excited there is a nice place like this to enjoy in our hometown! The entire evening was great - from the service, the food, the patio, the wine....we forgot all about our kids (date night) and really enjoyed our dinner! For me, that's 5 stars!  We started with the octopus appetizer. Wow. What a great start to the night!! It was cooked so perfectly and went nicely with the lemony arugula and the sauce on the plate. Then we shared the braised short rib and the sea bass. Both were great. The plating on the short rib surprised me - it really didn't look that great - the mushroom polenta looked so unappetizing piled under the rib....but it did not disappoint. Seasoning was a bit off, but when you got the bite all together it was pure bliss on the tongue. The sea bass was so yummy, crispy skin, cooked so simply - respecting the soft, delicate fish that it is. All of this was enjoyed with a nice bottle of wine. They have a decent wine list. Then dessert...Butterscotch pudding, done so nicely along with a cup of coffee. I do wish the coffee was done in a french press - it was lacking a bit.   The service was great! She was so friendly and attentive, was able to give good recommendations and knew about the ingredients in each item (we had to worry about food allergies).   Sitting out on the patio was great. I love their fun blue chairs, and the simple, sweet style of this place!! We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight, the food was amazing! Especially liked the grilled octopus and the grilled Caesar salad. The branzino was simple light and delicious. Grace was our server and she is just awesome. I highly recommend Nico if you are in Gilbert. We will be back."}
{"text":"Okayyyy, so I was visiting a friend who lives down the street from the cute little Downtown Gilbert area and I was so impressed with all of the delicious restaurant options that they have to offer. It is a lovely spot to spend an afternoon. They've done such a great job with this area!   My friend told me that Nico was owned by the creators of Virtu {one of my Top 5 Valley favs!} so I was immediately sold! I went all-in and ordered their rigatoni {homemade pasta} with slow roasted pork sugo, house made ricotta, and red wine. IT WAS TO DIE FOR. Like, i'm still dreaming about it a day later. Yup, I basically licked my plate and the portion was not small. My girlfriend ordered their grilled Caesar wedge and that was also incredible and a great portion size. It had a tasty char to it and the dressing was SO yummy. I would 100% get that again to start if I came back.   All in all, Nico was fresh, affordable, our food was phenomenal, and service was friendly. You better believe i'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Virtu so I was so pleased when my sweetie made reservations for Nico Heirloom. We went with two friends who are adventurous eaters and together we ordered seven dishes to try. We enjoyed them all, with just the clams being one we all agreed we would not order again. Loved the asparagus, the tomatoes, the kale, and the burrata. Great design in the restaurant. Some of the staff seem new and timid but they were certainly attentive."}
{"text":"OMG I just had a complete food orgasim this place will make your mouth drool for more.  The plates are so sexy and devine.  The service is right on point you won't be waiting for any attention ask for Penny.  Oh wait stop don't go, the new East Valley secret just came out the bag. All others will need protection if this keeps up.  First time in a long time no to go boxes needed.  Keep it up Gino's & Mike beautiful love."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast, lunch, or ANYTIME! Ask for Toby (very informative) the best employee who makes one hell of a Bellini."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place more but overall it was just average. The food was expensive for what it was, we got their restaurant week deal $44 per person and I got their sea bass which was a paper thin piece of fish served on top of cooked onions (disguising) and maybe a dozen olives. That's it. And I think it's about $26 off the reg menu. Not impressed. The deal also came with a glass of house wine which we liked, so we ordered a second glass. Turned out that second glass was $13 each! So $26 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?!  My husband's short ribs were average as well. The atmosphere is nice, the service was a bit slow. To sum things up, I had much higher expectations than what the place turned out to be."}
{"text":"We love coming here at all times of the day, month and year!  Every dish. Every detail when it comes to the service and food is amazing.  Brunch is a must if you have never been"}
{"text":"The food was cold, not seasoned well and wasn't  cooked to order. The waitress and staff was amazing though and the restaurant is pretty cool. I would not go back though."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert is continuing to add to its long row of restaurants that face Gilbert Rd. We had a large party that came to Nico's for a buddy's bday. Nico Heirloom brings a modern twist on Italian fare for Gilbert's casual crowd. Their sister restaurant Virtù has made all types of headlines here in the Valley. Nico has an open patio and beautiful decor that hangs on its brick walls. They roll their own pasta daily and have a nice selection of signature drinks to choose from. My one buddy ordered the Virtù Octopus and allowed me to sample it. I've only tried octopus once and it was very chewy. I was surprised how flavorful and not-so-chewy Nico's was. I was feeling pasta and ordered the Rigatoni. It had a delicious bold red wine sauce that was nicely balanced. I really enjoyed it. This was overall a great experience for myself and my friends."}
{"text":"A place serving up $10 bottomless mimosas that don't taste like death, I'm all for it and this is the spot to go now! What a hidden gem in Downtown Gilbert, my friends and I came in here for my buddies bday to do some day drinking and it was absolutely worth it!  As expected the food was a bit on the pricier side, but for the price I can't complain about the taste, nor did anyone else in the group. I got just a basic traditional breakfast but was good nonetheless and actually better than many breakfast plates of the same sort.   The bottomless mimosas were delicious! Some places offering up bottomless mimosas for around the same price tend to be lacking to say the least. However these were delicious here.  Service was above average, it took the server a little bit to catch on with how fast we would need refills, but after a while he was cranking those refills out. He even had a bit of a spill of one and the manager and the server were both very apologetic (even though spills happen so no biggie). This showed good management and service on their part though.  10/10 would come back here for the mimosas, and if I feel like splurging a little try more food from here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing! The waitress is amazing and very attentive. The food is very affordable and delicious! The town here is GREAT. Awesome location, awesome service, awesome food!! I definitely recommend this place and I'll probably even bring a few friends and family here. I love it! If I owned my own restaurant this is exactly how I'd imagine it!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Everyone seemed to be bothered if asked questions, especially the bartenders as we waited to get our table. The only nice person there was the hostess.   We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was very greasy and not very flavorful. We tried to order a tomahawk steak and they said in order for it to be cooked medium well we would have to wait an hour. So we got the flat iron steak and although we asked for medium well it was pretty bloody. The creamy corn tasted like canned corn with cream nothing special."}
{"text":"So delicious and authentic! My daughter and I shared the Grilled Asparagus antipasti, which was spectacular. We both ordered the Rigatoni with short rib for our entree, which was out of this world. My daughter and I couldn't believe we were eating authentic Italian food in downtown Gilbert! Definitely going back, and we are interested to try his restaurant in Scottsdale called Virtu!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a Tuesday night in the Arizona heat. What an absolute delight! The service was top notch. Grace was very informative, friendly and just all around a pro at her trade. The food was fantastic. I personally am vegan and they were very accommodating. The chef even made the most beautiful fruit plate for my desert! If you are in downtown Gilbert make sure you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with a great inside out atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and had a relaxed confident sense to them. Would recommend to anyone who wants excellent food."}
{"text":"We had salmon, asparagus, and penne vodka were outstanding! The atmosphere was cozy. We will return again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing no doubt. The staff did not live up to the food. Very impatient staff and none of the tables were full. Our waitress seemed as though we were an inconvenience instead of treating us with enthusiasm. Hope we don't get her again."}
{"text":"The first time I tried to eat at Nico's the electricity went out and they had to close the restaurant. The second time I made reservations I got the flu and had to cancel. When they say three is a charm they must not have had this restaurant in mind. I ordered the Pesce Olio (poached butterfish) puttanesca with charred tomatoes, olives, capers and butter bean ragu. First of all, when I think of butterfish it comes to mind a light buttery fish with mild flavor that wants to melt in your mouth. This however, was a thick meaty fish without a speck of flavor. The olives were overpowering and the bean ragu tasted like mush. None of the flavors meshed with one another and were not complimentary. My friend had the sea bass which was crispy on the outside but again, slightly overcooked to not be light and flaky on the inside. My husband had their much-touted Lasagna al forno Bolognese; which apparently beat Bobby Flay's. However, once again...cooked too long. On a positive note my other friend had the Veal Marsala and he liked it. The service was outstanding and the location is great but there are too many fabulous restaurants in the area to ever go back here. All around it was  a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Beautiful, classy spot outside and in, in downtown Gilbert.  Heard great things and after our experience for the most part this is indeed a place you'll want visit.  Some very good dishes here.    * Octopus appetizer was very good, * meatballs appetizer was excellent, * Big eye tuna excellent, * smoked duck breast was also delicious * rigatoni with sausage ragu was just ok * pappardelle pasta with pork also good not wow  Only complaint... Might have been the loudest restaurant I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"Love the decor. Tim was an awesome server!  The octopus is the best I've had. Meatballs were amazing!  The cannelloni and short ribs were perfect. We went for my husbands birthday and were treated to an amazing dessert.   One complaint - it's a bit loud. The guy next to us was obnoxious but that is not the fault of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"We just came here for our anniversary and it was the best meal we've had in a long time! The food was outstanding. We got the short rib, this smashed potatoes, the lasagna, and the sticky toffee cake. The lasagna was probably the best lasagna we've ever had... The béchamel sauce in it was creamy and delicious. The short rib has more meat on it than you would expect and the wine sauce over it is so good. Don't skip the cake for your dessert- the sauce over the warm cake was the perfect way to end our meal. This will definitely be our go to special occasion dinner joint!  It's nice that you get such quality food without breaking the bank. Plus the service is the best in town. Definitely a five star! Can't wait to bring people back."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful the decor is done very well.  But the food misses the mark. It's ok and done well but just isn't really worth the value.  We have tried it three times and never gets better. Maybe we will try again. Maybe ..."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was excellent! The atmosphere was pleasant and part of the downtown Gilbert, AZ district."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a late morning breakfast so we decided to try Nico's.  We were seated quickly and our waiter was Gavin with the deep voice!  He was friendly and helpful throughout our whole dining experience.  I ordered the pork ragu with polenta and it was quite delicious!  The polenta was creamy and was perfect with the pork and the sunny side up egg!  I wish I had taken a picture.  Now here is where it gets complicated.  My husband ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak was cooked well but there was a wine based sauce with it and he can't have alcohol.  The eggs were sunny side up and he doesn't do runny eggs.  The menu didn't give a choice.  Gavin our waiter came to the rescue and brought out the manager who then gave my husband a whole new custom ordered breakfast of steak, potatoes and scrambled eggs.  He bent over backwards to make us happy!   We were stunned to see it removed from our bill when presented with the check!  We didn't expect that at all nor was it our intent to get a free meal.  The manager was very kind and understanding and did everything to make our meal pleasant and apologized to us which wasn't at all necessary.  We will definitely be back to try something different and we'd like to try the dinner menu.  I would like to thank both the manager and Gavin for making our experience there special."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my husband's and mine favorite place to go for date night and special occasions. The lasagna is to die for and we've never had a meal we didn't extremely enjoy. Go for the octopus appetizer and the Brussels sprouts as a side. Wonderful cocktails, as well. The staff are also extremely nice and make our visit extra worthwhile."}
{"text":"The place is cute and trendy. I came for lunch on a Monday. I was really disappointed with the speed of the service. The restaurant was fairly busy, but we waited a very long time even for water and drinks. I got the nico benedict and it was pretty good! The hollandaise was spicy and added a great flavor to the dish. We were pleasantly surprised that the two meals that didn't come out at the same time as the rest were taken off our bill. We weren't really impressed overall, but I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Hands down, best cocktail is town, if not the state. Ask for Ryan. The key to a good cocktail, or Manhattan in my case, is consistency and he is the best around. He never fails. Oh and the octopus is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...saw the review in Phoenix Home and Garden...and went.  Love it that is in Downtown Gilbert.  Lasagna is fantastic!"}
{"text":"What we ordered was precisely how we asked it to be coming out. Medium, how we like the meat, and well done, how we like the pasta. And they were amazing!  The filet Mignon and spaghetti al pesto was the bomb! Great service and better food. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! It was pretty quiet when we went in because it was a Monday and 10:30am but I'm sure this place is poppin' on the weekends. It's in a beautiful spot and it was lovely sitting outside. The hostess/waitress was super friendly and nice and gave great recommendations. The food came out soon after and OMG the food is to die for. My boyfriend and I split the \"Chistorra and Eggs\" and the \"Pork Ragu\" for brunch. It was priced nicely and the serving sizes were perfect!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here for date night and it was off the charts! Everything we have tried has been off the charts! First time we had the virtu octopus app, salad which we had both times because it is the best salad ever but can't remember the name (it starts with a P and has an avocado aioli), the branzino fish that was light and fresh, pork rib sugo pasta which was hearty and flavorful. This time we had the grilled asparagus which was to die for, salad, smoked duck (must like bleu cheese) and the flat iron steak which was mind blowingly juicy and full of flavor! BUT Do not leave without having the sticky toffee cake!! It was the most amazing dish with brûlée bananas, chocolate cake and marscapone cream  the happy hour is also a great deal with $25 bottles of wine and the piedmonts are something that must be experienced!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try out this new restaurant, as we frequently go to downtown Gilbert, and it did not not let us down. It was delicious!! We started with a beer and a glass of wine. The wine list looks great, some spendy ones on there that maybe I'll splurge for sometime. I picked the \"If you see Kay\" cab blend, perfect glass of wine!! The server was knowledgeable and offered a suggestion for each segment of the menu. We started with the wood fired octopus, although the portion of the octopus was small, it was so flavorful!! Then I had the penne which was a great and a good sized portion... I only had half and I was completely stuffed! My boyfriend had the parpadelle which we both really enjoyed! Loved the decor, we had fabulous service, and impressive food! This is a great more upscale addition to Gilbert that these foodies will definitely return to!! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Love it. Sunday FUNDAY starts here. Bottomless Mimosa's? I'm in!!  We found the bottom, it's at 2pm, they cut it off. Probably a good idea, I could of sat there all day. It's a beautiful restaurant and the food was great too. I had the french onion burger and it was the bomb! What really made the experience great was the bartenders, Michelle was great. I never had to ask her to fill up my glass, she was sarcastic and funny, and she had a great banter with Ryan.  We were giving her the business and she was giving it right back.  I'm writing this Monday morning and I'm looking forward to this Sunday already. This time Im going in earlier!  Nico is my new favorite place in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great atmosphere, friendly wait staff, food is excellent and flavorful, and great pricing. Outdoor seating and happy hour prices makes for enjoyable happy hour or date night"}
{"text":"Nice way to start off in Gilbert.  Interesting menu and very tasty, tho definitely on the pricier side.  I hope they'll copy the brunch menu from Virtu very soon.  Biggest downside: music too loud.  No, it doesn't have to be eardrum popping, even tho they think so at Postino down the street.  A nice restaurant can have ambience without a racket coming from the speakers!  Low level background, if you must.  Even better - none!  A great restaurant shouldn't have to distract its customers!"}
{"text":"YIKES. Reservation for 8pm on Saturday, we got sat at 8:45.  Took a bit for the server to show up. Local beers on tap were great, although it would have been nice if they actually filled my glass. Appetizer, polento, was mediocre.  Most of the items on the menu were pork based, disappointing for us non-pork eaters. I ordered the servers suggestion, miscut pasta, a complete disappointment and not something I would ever serve someone. No options to add meat? Tasted like this pasta packets my roommate in college made me try, but without the seasoning. Straight butter & black pepper. Tomatoes? Parsley? Basil? Something?  I sent it back & got the spinach salad. Spinach, candied walnuts, and cheese. Nothing more, nothing less. The dressing was a straight balsamic reduction, what??  Boyfriend said his lasagna was excellent.  Still in shock in how awful the food was, maybe they just messed up my order? This can't possibly be the same food people are raving about. Raise your standards, Gilbert"}
{"text":"Fav new restaurant. Service is excellent and food is amazing. Came in for dinner and back the following morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"Arizona hospitality.  On my last visit to AZ, I was finally able to drive out to three different cities to meet Yelp buds at three different restaurants. I was so happy I finally got around to doing this because Arizonians, native and transplanted ones, are special people.  Especially my friend, the lovely Miss Joyce W., who invited me to crash a weekday brunch with her awesome friends here that was hosted by  Yelper Aileen B., who was so very sweet in allowing me to join in on their meal.  I joked that it was also a time for Asian solidarity for me as I was sitting at a table with 7 other Asians, and I had not been with that many Asians in my travels in Arizona to date ;)  Nico Heirloom Kitchen has a beautiful interior to their restaurant here in Gilbert, but we congregated on the outdoor patio as it was a beautiful day and some of my dining companions had brought their adorable furry dog babies along. Perusing the brunch menu, I was torn as I was considering the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, but I finally decided on the Brown Butter French Toast. This was made with buttery, carmelized Noble Bread and was accompanied by  candied figs and an amazingly delicious Mascarpone. It was delectable and plated with a side of fruit.  My fellow diners had ordered some other great-looking brunch dishes which they seemed to enjoy as well.  Staff was friendly and attentive and brought out bowls of water for our doggie companions as well.  Nico's was a great place to meet up with new friends and have a tasty brunch. I look forward to coming back to this restaurant in the future to explore more of the \"West Coast-inspired Italian cuisine\" from Chef Gio Osso here."}
{"text":"First inclination of this restaurant is that would be a dumbed-down version of Virtu in attempt to appease the less sophisticated, more frugal residents of the southeast valley.  Much to my delight, Chef Gio didn't skip a beat when putting together the menu.  While no doubt the menu's construction was considerate of the wallets and palates of the local diners, the food was a home run.  The whole meal we had was exquisite.  On our first visit, we opted for the now famous Lasagna, thanks to Beat Bobby Flay, as well as the Chicken which many others have mentioned here on Yelp.  Our bookends were the warm olives with homemade Focaccia (outrageously good) and the sticky toffee cake which left us speechless.    Definitely the new star of Downtown Gilbert"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Service is always fantastic and the food is fresh and tasty.  The Pork Suko is to die for.  My husband and I have been looking for a good Italian restaurant in Gilbert because we are tired of driving to Scottsdale or Phoenix.  Nicos is as good if not better than most places in Scottsdale or Phoenix.  We have been here 4 times since it opened.  Yay for not having to drive 30 minutes to get great Italian food and ambiance.  Love all the new restaurants coming to Gilbert.  Keep em coming!!"}
{"text":"Nico's is amazing. I was beyond excited when I heard Chef Gio was opening a restaurant in Gilbert because I'm such a huge fan of Virtu, and Gilbert is seriously lacking in the fine dining department. It's been a great addition to downtown Gilbert and has become a regular go-to for us. #nicolove"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the outside seating.  My gf and I were here Sunday, early evening. Service was slow given the lack of people there.  I ordered the filet mignon medium rare. It came out with no pink whatsoever. I did like the portion sizes since I'm not a fan of restaurants that serve gigantic portions.  The chocolate toffee cake was amazing though."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last Friday night. The service was wonderful, ambiance was perfect and most of the food was good.   For apps we ordered the olives and the caprese. The bread that comes with this. OMG. It may have been some of the best bread I've ever had. Clearly made from scratch.   I ordered the Flat Iron Steak cooked Medium rare for dinner and it was perfect. My fiancé ordered the chicken and unfortunately is was overdone.   We'll definitely come back with the hope of other entrees being just as good as my steak."}
{"text":"Let me tell ya....Shiloh (hope I spelt that correctly) was our bartender and that man was AMAZING! He was so accommodating and willing to make us the cocktail of our choosing even if it wasn't on the menu. I went out on a limb and asked for a chocolate martini...and this dude killed it! It was so yummy!! This guy is really an artist! I hate to be that person who asks for off menu items, but man, I'm still dreaming of that martini! Needless to say, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cute Decor, classy, clean, I ordered the lasagna it was dry and overbaked. I was surprised they served it to me with   all the edges being black. No bread, no salad. One gingerale One lasagna 25$"}
{"text":"Me and my husband tried this place it was amazingly, indescribably awesome!! You have to try the Octopus. We never knew it could taste so wonderful. We always thought it had to be breaded and dipped in a sauce, or included in a seafood stew to make it edible. Not so in this case, you just have to try it to believe it, reminded me of a cross between grilled shrimp and mahi-mahi. The chili butter that came with it was a great compliment, didn't overpower the taste of the octopus. I got the Sea Bass, which was cooked perfectly. They cooked it in their wood fired oven so the skin was crispy and delicious! Don't avoid it as you usually would, eat it, it will surprise you! My husband got the house made spaghetti and asked for the meatballs on top and absolutely loved it. We topped it off with the house made Chocolate Toffee Cake. If we could have licked the bowl it came in without embarrassing ourselves we would have! This chef has mad skills! Don't miss out, try this place! We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful addition to the hot new location in Gilbert. Ordered spaghetti al pesto and chicken scallopini to share. Both entrees were good. It is a bit on the expensive side. Would have liked bread on the table...I never think I've eaten without a bit of bread.  Service was friendly but server was occupied chatting with another table frequently."}
{"text":"Food was good (I had the penne alla vodka). My friends had the lasagna and shrimp scampi which they said was average but not the best they've had. Portion sizes are fairly small for the price in my opinion but the main downfall was how long it took to get our food. We sat down around 730pm and didn't get our food until about 845pm! So prepare to order an appetizer or just not be super hungry when you go here :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. My go to brunch spots, 10$ bottomless mimosas is unbeatable. The guy bartender is so friendly, we love this place. The vibe is so hipster chic unlike any where else!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time tonight (hubby, 7 year old and 4 year old). The atmosphere evoked a casual elegance that was warm and inviting. The service was good and we really enjoyed our meals. The standouts for tonight were my grilled octopus served with arugula and fennel. I had it as an entree and I was quite satisfied even after sharing bites with my family. The taste was quite good and the kids even asked for more!  My hubby had a drink with bourbon and berries in it that was also refreshingly tasty and I don't usually care for hard liquor. The butterscotch pudding was also amazing. We'll definitely be back for a date night soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We were able to ring in the New Year with a table reservation and they never hurried us out to leave. They closed up allowing us to comfortably enjoy the occasion with friends. Drinks and food were great!! Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Be prepared for poor acoustics.....now, on to the food.....charred octopus - yum!  Heirloom tomatoes - you have our attention!    My husband ordered their version of \"spaghetti and meatballs\" There is a reason they don't have this on the menu - we are not on The Hill in St Louis or in the North End in Boston. The meatballs were a C.  The pasta was a C.  The bread served with the meatballs was undercooked and smothered with olive oil.  Thinking it was safe to send bread back to be toasted up (they have a wood fired oven for Petes sake)....mmmm, not so much.  However, I ordered the Bronzino and it was perfectly cooked and delish.  Our waitress was delightful and very knowledgable.  They have a few kinks to work out (out of this, out of that - Grey Goose- really?!?!) We will try it again in 6 months to see how they're doing.  There is promise here......"}
{"text":"It was restaurant week and thought I would give this place a try . I was delightfully happy with my choice. I stared with the calamari salad ... Thick pieces with an amazing sauce . Then for the main course I tried the short rib. Let me just tell you I was five seconds away from swallowing the bone the flavor was so rich and amazing . The meat just fell Off , and of course the desert .... Creme brûlée . I'm typically not a desert eater but I couldn't stop after one bite . Great ambiance otherwise they could use some different mood Music"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening with good company and good food. Everything was made fresh and tasted great. We'll be coming back. Ask for Tim. He knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Great fine dining addition to Downtown Gilbert.  Grilled octopus appetizer was excellent!  Our server shared the brunch menu with us, which was more extensive than their website.  Menu offerings are more enticing... Keeping it bookmarked for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"We came out from Chicago to get away for the weekend, and found this place after being told downtown Gilbert is a fun part of the city. The campenelle may have been the best pasta I've had in a very long time. The pasta itself was delicious, but when paired with the filet, or better yet the whole roasted garlic cloves, purely delicious. As if that wasn't enough I went all in and had the chocolate toffee sticky cake for desert. I dare you to find a better desert!  It's simply not possible."}
{"text":"Take some solid picks from the Virtu menu, steal the interior design from Sam Fox, and drop it right in the heart of the East Valley suburban mecca that is oldtown Gilbert.  The place doesn't lend itself to intimacy, very loud, but dishes are superbly crafted and it is a safe place from which Suburbia can move beyond spaghetti and explore further into Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Was in on a Monday evening, so it was pretty quiet.  The food was good - I had the shrimp scampi and it was delicious.  Service was good and consistent.  Definitely recommend you give them a try.  I'll be going back for another round soon."}
{"text":"Service was great when we first got there (early) but degraded to a disagreeable wait as the evening went on.  Couldn't catch a server to save our lives. We were a party of four and other than the meatball starter, we would not order anything we had again. The Sazerac cocktail was abysmal. Do not order it.   I had the octopus. I love octopus! But this was so heavily seasoned I couldn't taste it. Very disappointed. Maybe people like it because they can't actually taste the octopus?  My partner had the lasagna. Boring. I tasted it and I can safely say I can do better. At these price points I should be wowed but I was left with an empty wallet and a sneaking suspicion that I'd been conned."}
{"text":"Have now dined here twice and both times were incredible. The first time we ate here we came for brunch, everything was perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. Last evening we stopped in for happy hour before going to the Hale Theater. Ryan was our bartender and server, he was incredible, both mixing our cocktails and interacting with us. We had the stuffed little neck clams and meatballs, both delicious. For dessert we shared the tiramisu for two, get it! We shall return again & again and spread the word of how wonderful this place is."}
{"text":"Andrew is probably one of the best servers I have ever encountered. He is very knowledgeable and informative. Andrew is also super kind, we appreciated his attitude on a busy day, Mother's Day! Because of him, we will be back! Thanks for making Sunday brunch very special!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Our go- to restaurant for fine dining in Gilbert.  Lasagne is the best.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Do not do take out from here. I cannot imagine having to wait as long as we did for food. My first visit to this place. Wanted to try it out before making a trip to have eat in dinner. We love supporting our downtown Gilbert restaurants. However if I had known a roasted chicken for $21 is an anemic chicken quarter I may have chosen something else. The branzino, $22, was tasty but again small and buried under a mountain of wilted kale.  Asparagus starter,$12, amounted to about 9 pieces, small, looked like tiny green beans and under seasoned.  Have to wonder if this place is trying to hard to be an upscale place in the heart of Gilbert. I think a little tough with so many casual places close by that seem to fit the area better.   Needless to say most likely won't go back. Small portions, meh taste, slow service, low value for cost and almost no interaction other than \"what would you like? , ok\" 30 min later \"here you go\"."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything from their crafted cocktails to delicious appetizers and amazing homemade pasta.  We have been here numerous times and yet to be disappointed. Don't miss the octopus, it's out of this world and a must."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to start a girls day out! We started with brunch and bottomless mimosas.  The service was great and the food was even better. Me and a friend both ordered the steak and eggs and we were both very pleased with it. My mom ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were good but a little too thick for her liking (and mine). The restaurant is very nice and I'm glad it wasn't as busy as i thought it would be since it was downtown gilbert during breakfast/brunch time. We walked right in and were seated. We're all looking forward to going back for more brunch, mimosas and bellinis!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My brother recommended to go here for mothers day, so we went! Our server was so nice (I wish I remembered is name). They had bottomless mimosas and peach Bellini's, that were under ten dollars! I will definitely be coming here again. The food was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, and the price was great too!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with the wifey for date night. We went during restaurant week so we were able to taste a few different dishes. We started out with their famous grilled octopus and I got a calamari that was pan seared and tossed in a flavorful sauce. We both agreed that the octopus was good but was slightly underwhelming for all the hype it gets. For entrees I got the braised shirt rib over Parmesan polenta....can you say rich? Very flavorful but would like the polenta to be a touch smoother. My wife got their lasagna and she did not care for it but I thought it was good. Their cocktails were phenomenal though, very unique but really tasty!   Finished the meal with the profiteroles which were just okay. I really loved the decor of the restaurant they really did well on that part. After seeing their brunch menu, that is really what I want to return for!"}
{"text":"Nico's is absolutely amazing. I have never had a dining experience quite like I had this evening. The staff is fantastic. Brad the owner, Chuck the GM, and Fernando one of the bartenders made us feel so at home. This will become one of our weekly spots for just a relaxing happy hour with delicious small plates, as well as a top spot for a night out with family and friends and some amazing main course meals."}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to Downtown Gilbert. The pasta is house made and very good. The filet is a great steak. The burrata appetizer is great, great combination of flavored and textures. Love the happy hour items available before 6pm, the garlic fries with a spicy sauce are nice. The service has been very good each time, clearing empty plates quickly, topping off drinks early, switching out utensils between courses, etc.  Don't miss the caramels in the bowl by the front door on the way out!"}
{"text":"I had eaten at this restaurant during restaurant a year ago but did not try their signature dishes. The octopus was dry, tough, black and definitely not worth the cost. The craft cocktails are good. I was terribly disappointed as a signature dish should not matter whether you order on a Sunday versus a Friday. It was not busy, so business is no excuse. Cute place. Service was good."}
{"text":"We had brunch and it was amazing. My husbands steak and eggs was to die for. Super friendly service too. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here.  Both had a cocktail, an entree and a dessert.  All were tasty.   My only problem was choosing what I wanted.  SO many great options on the menu.  Try a dish that comes with their polenta.  It's really good.  Also had great, attentive service.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Not a breakfast place for me...I knew that but thought of giving it a chance. The menu lists entrees that even an above average person can not figure out. Extra crispy bacon only mean one thing but that wasn't even right. The bottomless Bellini was bottomless definitely and it was worth $10 for all that I had. It makes sense that the place was pretty empty on a Sunday when all other places had a wait."}
{"text":"It depends on the night but last time we came here they were busy and since we didn't have reservations , we couldn't be seated for a few hours . To avoid this from happening again, my husband made reservations. I've been wanting to come here for some time and I'm glad we were able to have our date night here. We started with some drinks and the virtu octopus appetizer. This appetizer was so good. It had a nice charred taste and the octopus was super tender. I would go back just to have this again. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi and I ordered the over baked lasagna because  it was on the Bobby Flay challenge. The portions were smaller but very filling. Loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant and our server was great. We will definitely be back to try some other dishes on the menu"}
{"text":"The cook explained the dish and made it sound very good. Great staff that is knowledgable. Smiles all around. Great interior and great chefs. The wood fire grill is amazing and the cook on it knew his stuff. Special thanks to Jeremy for the recommendation of the porchetta. It was amazing."}
{"text":"YUM.....    First time here just had some wine and appetizers and they were delish. (Recommend the polenta dish!)  Last night a few friends split some entrees.  Wow... so well prepared and tasty.  The flank steak was everything I thought it would be and the chicken ? cacciatore was perfection!   The spinach is garlicy lovefest!      Red Sangrias rounded out the meal perfectly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - The Outfield - I Don't Want To Lose Your Love Tonight)  Nico's in a location far away Come around to Gilbert downtown So many things that I want to try You know I like my songs a little bit older I just wanna try your food tonight I just wanna try your drinks tonight  I got so many yelpers left to talk to No one's around when you're in trouble You know I'll be giving 5 stars for food Start with Apps and end with housemade pasta I just wanna try your food tonight I just wanna try your drinks tonight   So I learned when I came that this was the sister restaurant to Virtu and got excited!  I came with a group of the foodie friends.  The place has a nice open layout and a contemporary rustic posh feel and look.   We sat and I shot for a quick cocktail since I as remember Virtu has some fun cocktails; needless to say, Nico's didn't disappoint.  For my appetizer I shot for their famous Octopus starter; Octopus, lemon chickpeas, and chili butter with a side of arugula salad.  If you haven't had this dish yet you have to try it even if octopus is not your thing.  The octopus was meaty and a hint of saltiness with the chili butter providing a kick of spice.  The chickpeas gave it a nice and welcoming texture along with the bitterness of the arugula salad.  For my entree I ordered their housemade pasta the Pappardelle Salsiccia; sausage ragu, garlic, and peppers.  The pasta was thick and doughy to the bite; almost a tad bit underdone, but I actually like it that way!    Overall, Nico has great atmosphere and the service here was ready to rock and roll when you are.  I had great experience with my friends and along with great drinks and food here so definitely a recommendation and coming back soon! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tonite was our second visit and unfortunately probably our last.   We started with Nonna's Meatballs. They arrived and were cool to lukewarm at best. Waitress offered to replace them, we accepted and the replacements were just a bit warmer than the first. We decided to eat them and not make a fuss. They were marginal, and actually had some very chewy areas, which seemed odd for meatballs, but maybe that was intended with the blend of beef and pork.  My wife had the Filet Mignon, which was a good size, but had numerous areas of grizzle, which were inedible. I ordered the Branzino (Sea Bass) and that was fairly dry, not particularly flavorful and small. It only comes with a clump of Arugula on top, no sides, other than some prosciutto.  For dessert, we ordered the lemon pound cake. Presentation was good, except for the charred edges on the pound cake overpowering the delicate flavors of the mouse, unburnt areas of the cake and edible flowers.  Overall, another disappointing visit!   Great idea for something different in downtown Gilbert, but the execution is not up to par.   They'll attract crowds on Fridays and Saturdays for the first year, loading up with first timers and people not wanting to wait for an hour and a half at Postinos, etc. but I can't imagine they'll get a lot of repeat diners, unless they improve dramatically."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to give this review for a while! One of my best gfs recently got engaged, so we wanted to throw her a cute engagement brunch. We had called various restaurants but places charged extra fees and were not very nice. However, when I called Nico, the gentleman I spoke to was so friendly and wanted to help with the process! Therefore we decided to go with this restaurant for our celebration.   When we got there, the waitress, Kiana, greeted us and offered to help us bring in gifts and get us settled. She provided excellent service and checked on us just the right amount. As for the food, we were all so happy with our meals! I ordered the pasta, and it tasted homemade - it was delicious!   Overall, the brunch couldn't have gone better, and we have Nico to thank for that. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is deeeelicious but service can be improved.  The dishes are unique and I especially love their breakfast menu.  The servers are not welcoming, warm or friendly."}
{"text":"Summary - if you like Virtu, you will like this place.  Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Made a 6pm reservation, but it wasn't really necessary as restaurant was only half full. I have been to Virtu a half dozen times, so I was expecting a similar level of quality and was not disappointed.   Food:  Virtu octopus : I can report that it's just as flawless as at Virtu. Bitter arugula, flavorful chickpeas, perfectly charred octopus, and some good spice. This is a must-order, whether you like octopus or not. A+  Grilled mixed vegetables: Admittedly, this was more of my wife's choice than mine. That said, all the vegetables were prepared and seasoned perfectly. I believe there was eggplant, zucchini, squash, and a few others. There was a weird pickled something in there that we didn't care for, but other than that it was very solid. A  Pesto Spaghetti with Chicken: I added chicken to this dish, which was a solid choice. Basil pesto was fresh and light. Homemade spaghetti had great texture. Chicken was shredded and was easy to eat. A  I ordered a bourbon drink that was pretty good as well, but wasn't anything insanely stellar. Overall, service was pretty good and food was great. This is a very solid addition to downtown Gilbert. I will surely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner. I had the duck and he had pasta. The food was delicious. The manager checked in twice with our various courses to be sure the food was on point and our waitress was amazing. They comp'd a dessert for our anniversary which was unexpected and wonderful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Great service, EXCELLENT FOOD!!! We love to brunch here, their take on eggs Benedict is perfection. Lunch is also very good and we haven't been for dinner yet but plan to very soon! Beautiful atmosphere, doesn't feel like just another Gilbert restaurant."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. We came later in the evening and we're seated immediately. Waiter and service were excellent. The item we wanted to try the most was out. We tried the spaghetti pomodoro, flat iron steak, veggies, and mushrooms. The mushrooms were really good mixed in with the spaghetti but I wouldn't get the veggies again. The waiter recommended a butterscotch pudding dessert which would've normally sounded boring to me but it was actually really good. Overall, the flat iron steak and spaghetti are better down the road at Liberty Market for a fraction of the cost. This is a nice spot for a special date night."}
{"text":"To me, brunch was the meal lazy people ate. People ranted and raved about the mystic and curative powers of brunching, but i had my doubts. I was a non-believer, but this joint converted me faster than the refills on my bottomless mimosas and bellinis.  I came in with a group of four fellas and we were eager to get our squad game on. Their menu is quite extensive, and they have quite a good selection of different food items and tastes to choose from. The breakfast potatoes starter was on point. The star of the show was their octopus, which is the most tender and delicious i have ever had. Who ever thought your best octopus culinary experience could take place in a desert (apparently the secret is to throw a cork in the pot when you're boiling it down).  The mimosas and bellini were on point, and they helped make a lively group and delicious food taste that much better.   Through this experience i have come to learn that brunching is less of an experience than a state of mind. The flesh is willing but the wallet is weak: brunch we will meet again soon."}
{"text":"Love this place and the staff! They were so accommodating, my wife is vegan and they did everything to accommodate her. We were there till late and not once did they make us feel like we had to leave or it was getting late. We will be coming back and bringing lots and lots of friends with us! Highly recommend this place. Food was amazing, I would say the fish we had was superb! And I have to give it up to waitress grace she was amazing!"}
{"text":"The French toast was Amazing! I had great customer service ! Truly enjoyed our waitress. I went in on a Sunday and enjoyed bottomless mimosas for $10. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Best dinning in Gilbert!  You simply can't get the quality or uniqueness Nico's offers at another gilbert restaurant.  Toby took it from a meal to an experience we will not soon forget."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is great for a Sunday brunch. The food is delicious and you can't go wrong with bottomless mamosas for 10$"}
{"text":"We've been for dinner and brunch (bottomless mimosas, homemade Nutella crepes, amazing egg dishes), both times the food was delicious! It is a great addition to downtown Gilbert. Service was a little slow but I'm sure with time that will improve."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Nice tables, bar, outside seating area and decor. Clean bathrooms. The food was pretty good but the menu seemed limited. Could have gotten 5 stars if not for the poor service. Super slow service with hardly any patrons in the entire place (maybe 4 tables/2 servers). We waited close to 15 minutes just to get waters and a menu. Never ordered a second drink because no one even came to ask. Plates piled up on the table as we finished appetizers and were not cleared.  Overall food and atmosphere would make us go back if not for the service."}
{"text":"Being a frequent diner at Virtu, Gio's newest store Nico's does not stray one bit from his core belief and practice that a high quality restaurant must deliver a hi quality product AND courteous service. He nails it once again. His menu is spot on perfect. His wine selection thoughtful on price and packed with quality. Service here is only surpassed by the awesome cocktails his bar serves up. The Tuscan Treat cocktail is unreal. His appetizers and entrees are created from the best of ingredients, all made from scratch, and the flavors perfected by his top notch kitchen staff. TOP NOTCH STORE !!!!   BEST IN GILBERT!!!!  Im bringing my family, friends and clients here ALL the time."}
{"text":"I have almost gone in to Nico a few times over the past couple of years now. Something from the outside has always intimidated me. This is unusual for me considering I'll go in anywhere that I feel invited. Don't get me wrong, it isn't that this place isn't inviting because it is only, you have to actually make your way through the doors.   Maybe it was the menu out front that always made it feel too fancy? Maybe it was that the reflection on the windows and low seating inside make it appear empty from the outside? I'm not sure whatever prevented me from going in initially, but I am glad we decided upon it finally.   The atmosphere is a bit intimate, I really like the feel. I wouldn't call it hipster but more elegant. Don't let the elegance dissuade you either. I visited in rather casual attire and most of the patrons who were there were also dressed however they wanted to be.   Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant wasn't busy at the time since we were between lunch and dinner so my experience may differ from a more busy time.   We started with their octopus which the Man loved! I wasn't as much a fan but only because I was curious as to whether the octopus had a name or if it felt anything while it was being slayed for a meal. I did give it a try and upon immediate taste I felt that it tasted like chicken. I know, but even the consistency was like a breast cooked to perfection. Of course, it didn't really taste like chicken but that is what it reminded me of as far as consistency goes. This was like a real octopus, not strips or any of that calamari, legit large pieces of octopus that was braised for hours. For my main course I decided upon the shrimp scampi, he decided on the sea bass and we got the cheesy potatoes as a side. Though I did enjoy my dish, the flame roasted tomatoes added a burnt flavor that I didn't find palatable. This was an error on my part as the menu did specific they were roasted. The shrimp were large and delicious. He enjoyed his sea bass and had difficulty deciding whether he wanted to eat it all there or take some home. I didn't have a taste of his because I wasn't really willing to share mine. The potatoes? Absolutely delicious! I would go there for a side of potatoes alone! The prices are a bit steep however; it seems the quality of food was up to par therefore the pricing was understandable. I would like to go back and give brunch a try at some point. All of these wonderful places to check out, leave little time to frequent them all more often but I'm sure we'll make it back."}
{"text":"Decent place with great innovative drinks and modern Italian cuisine. Caprese was top notch with lightly grilled bread. Branzino was light and flavorful and the rigatoni with pork was rich and filling with the house made pasta the star of the dish.   Butterscotch pudding with salted carmel was a tasty finish to the meal.   Love the outdoor seating - until the fire engines come blaring by."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day thinking the menu sounded amazing but the food was premade which was a huge disappointment. They have large window open to the kitchen and you see all the food waiting for just a quick warm. The food over all was bland and service ok never really got check on after our food came to the table. The ambience is trendy  but don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time here we came on a Thursday night. It wasn't a long wait to be seated, so that was nice. We sat outside, great weather, a little noisy, but not a big deal. We ordered drinks before dinner, which took a while to get to us for some reason.  We moved on to order dinner, this took a little too long and when our food finally got to us it was cold., and over cooked.  I know this place is is a local favorite, so we probably just caught them on a bad night, but with the cost of our dinner I was disappointed..... We are in central Phoenix so it was quite a drive for us and it wasn't worth the drive.  We won't be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to downtown Gilbert. Had the vertu octopus as an appetizer as suggested by others and it was delicious. Happy Hour prices were very reasonable for our beer and cocktail. The spaghetti al pesto was great and the other dish which I forgot the name was exceptional as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Took my husband for his Birthday Dinner. Chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. Unfortunately our visit did not compare to the rave reviews I read. Ordered the roasted farm vegetables for our starter. All we got were roasted beets, expected more of a variety.  Ordered the sea bass for my dinner. The outside of the fish was delicious. But most of it was under cooked to raw. When the waitress finally came to check and explained my raw fish issue she did offer to bring me a another dish however it had taken sibling to get our meal I declined. The management did comp my meal. Also My husband's pork chop was very overlooked. My low rating is based on quality and expectation of our meal. We most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"Definitely do not come here hungry. The food tasted good the service was good but the food portions were so small that I am on my way to Pomo to get more food. Spend $100 on an appetizer and two entres."}
{"text":"We chose Nico as a place to take my friend and her husband out to celebrate her birthday. I'd never been, but thought the decor and ambience were very nice. Our server did a great job of checking in often without hovering.   My husband and I split the Spinach Salad. The greens were fresh, and I enjoyed the goat cheese and bacon in it. I was a little disappointed by the lasagna though. It was cooked perfectly fine. I think I expected more because it was marked as a dish seen on the Food Network. All in all, I just didn't like the flavors and texture of it, which boils down to a simple case of personal preference. I didn't want to knock a star off since the restaurant did nothing wrong.  Last of all, they asked me when I called in the reservation if we were celebrating a special occasion. (My friend's birthday.) I thought it was a really nice touch to have the waiter bring out a complimentary birthday dessert with a lit candle. I'd like to come back and see if I could find a different entree I liked better and try Nico's again."}
{"text":"Delicious pasta!! Small portions but so rich I couldn't finish it. Took it home for leftovers and I can't wait to go back to try something new!!"}
{"text":"Went out with family. Four of us total. Had a reservation that they lost. No issue however we were seated right away despite them being on a wait. Great ambience to the place. Chairs quite uncomfortable however. I looked around and quite a few people were moving their chairs to get comfortable due to the narrowness of the sides to the seat. Our server was GREAT. Highly knowledgeable of the menu and made great recommendations for us.   We ordered 4 appetizers. All of which were very good. However between the 4 appetizers we all only had a few bites of each before they were gone.   We also ordered 5 entrees. Again GREAT FOOD but between the four of us we ate all of them. It is not a lot of food they serve here but the quality is very good.   Then we got our bill. With what we ordered we also had  a bottle of wine and a 3 beers. Our bill total was $220. The whole dinner took the better part of two hours from sit down to leaving. For the pricing I would have liked to see faster food times and more portions due to the cost. A slight cost revision or portion revision and I would have given it 4 stars. Those seat were quite uncomfortable after 2 hours.   All in all I would recommend the place to try out and see for yourself. Everyone has a different opinion."}
{"text":"We had a baby shower brunch here and the service was AMAZING. Everyone was so helpful they let us bring in our own decorations and cake. The food was so good everyone loved everything we ordered and the $10 bottomless mimosas were so good!"}
{"text":"You guys.... RUN don't walk to eat here. All I can say is WOW. Probably the best meal of my life, and I have had a lot of meals. I love the decor and feel of the restaurant, it's cozy and modern all at the same time. Our server was Matthew, and he was fantastic. He mentioned that tonight was his first night at Nico as he had previously worked at Virtu. You would have never known it was his first night. Okay.. Now onto the food. We decided to start with the Burrata and Porchetta - - OMG!!! I was skeptical about the Porchetta as I just think of chewy bacon fat in my mouth. This wasn't like that at all, it was melt in your mouth rich pork goodness. The Burrata was topped with tart cherries (I think) and oh so perfect. After appetizers we decided to split the Penne Sugo and if I had to eat one meal for the rest of my life I would be so okay with it being Penne Sugo. It was perfect, homemade pasta, salty, rich, everything I love in life. Who can skip dessert? Certainly not me... Mascarpone Panna Cotta? Sign me up! Topped with strawberries, pistachios, edible flowers, a jelly made out of wine... WHAT?!?!? AMAZING! I can't wait to go back. Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"We decided to try a different restaurant in downtown Gilbert, so went here.  New Favorite!!  Wife had Classic Crepes and was very pleased with the flavors, amount of food and the freshness was evident.  I had the BBL& T.  Amazing.  Bread was particularly wonderful, and the flavors were great.  The chili aioli left a light warmth on my mouth when I was done, which I really liked.  The bacon was incredible!  I don't care for extra crispy bacon, and this was cooked just right.  Service was a little slow, but didn't mind 'cause we weren't in a hurry.  I could go on, but I will just say we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went to Nico after being somewhat of a regular at virtu. It did not disappoint. The lasagne was excellent and the salmon, sea bass and deserts too.   The service was friendly but it did take a long time to get our food and we were passed \"peak\" hours. After the food arrived our server apologized and comped a round of drinks, which was really nice of her. Then the chef also apologized and sent us home with a lasagne on the house.   I feel this was a one off with the delay and will definitely be going back. I think I actually prefer this to virtu."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem- I'm shocked this place wasn't packed on a Sunday! The food is absolutely delicious-try the Rigatoni or the Pork Ragu on the brunch menu. Bottomless mimosas are only $10 with a meal! Diane took great care of us in the dining room and I moved to the bar shortly after and had great conversation with Carlos. Will definitely be back and spreading the word!"}
{"text":"I believe and think in good customer service as well as the total overview of a good ambiance place. This restaurant has overcome in all the standards. The place is just a relaxing environment to enjoy a meal during the whole time is open. Food taste and presentation is extraordinary. The location is perfect. Talking about curtained service, they have exceeded it!, I am really happy and please to recommend it to all my friends and family for their future visit to Arizona. Be prepare for a surprising desert menu and enjoy the great taste of it!"}
{"text":"So Nico was underwhelming... The wait staff was a little pushy and took longer than I would have liked to get out some of our food. I loved everything I ate -- and they brought me a really yummy dessert because it was my birthday -- but I will say it was too pricey for what the food was. Probably won't be returning but was a good one time experience"}
{"text":"Best spot in Gilbert. Service, food, atmosphere, it's the cream of the crop! I will be back, AGAIN"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I ever had in America.  Delicious sauces, pasta ao dente, flavours exploding in your mouth. Gorgeous decoration and very welcoming atmosphere.  We felt home - and will surely go back!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times.  The Octopus appetizer is absolutely fantastic!  Their rigatoni dish and quartered chicken is great as well! Fun atmosphere, and modern environment.  Would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I am so happy that Nico's has come to Gilbert.  The food is so creative and fresh.  We had the salsicce appetizer and flat iron steaks.  The meats were perfectly cooked and incredibly flavorful.  The fennel sausage was tasty; just the right amount of burned ends, as is appropriate.  The dessert I chose was the chocolate toffee cake.  Excellent.  Combined with a really relaxing and nicely appointed interior, Nico's was a hit for us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often - on date night. Definitely not a place for kids.   Service is high quality, personalized and friendly.   Food is decadent. Beautifully presented. Amazingly flavorful.   Drinks are gorgeous.   Love the freshness all around. Super romantic place at night. So excited it's now in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Yo, just get some of that delicious Brown Butter French Toast because you cannot go wrong with that at all. You get 5 slices of thick sliced french toast topped with a a delicious syrup and equally delicious mascarpone and candied figs! A bowl of fruit adds to this dish that breaks the sweetness, then you add a couple of good friends and you're in for a good time!"}
{"text":"Brunch on Saturday is on point! Bottomless mimosas, awesome prices and even better food! I got the pork Ragu and it will not disappoint. I highly highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really rough experience indicative of a brand new restaurant: We had a 6:30 reservation and were not seated until 7.  Food took 1 hour to arrive and one of the meals was not what was ordered. We were offered a free dessert (big whoop) and then the server just brought one without us picking it.  Under-cooked pasta was the nail in the coffin. Don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"New place we tried during restaurant week: good food, service, & atmosphere. The house white wine, the salmon cakes, & short rib were all good. However the Sogliola (sole) was supposed to be pan seared but it had no sear & it tasted like it had been poached, great flavor but needed that crisp texture. The biggest surprise was the Beet Pannacotta dessert with the shaved beet roots added a crisp texture and surprisingly when we added the goat cheese in it all worked together very well."}
{"text":"Every course was amazing. Chef-driven food with an outstanding wine list and ingredients that should make Gilbert residents explore outside their comfort zone. Great addition to Gilbert."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this place and the service was good too! My boyfriend got the scampi pasta and I decided on the lasagna because the tables on both sides of me had ordered it so I thought it must be good! Every table got fresh baked bread so we finally decided to ask for some. It was good but they only have us two small pieces with no butter or olive oil and vinegar which all the tables had but we just ate it anyway. The food came out and my boyfriends pasta dish was SO small although it came in a huge bowl. He was disappointed and he finished it in maybe 5 bites. It came with 5 pieces of jumbo shrimp which tasted great. My lasagna was good. It wasn't a traditional lasagna and it was a tad rich for me. It kind of hurt my stomach. Overall the service was good, the food was alright and once again the atmosphere was great. I could see why people like this place but I probably wouldn't make an effort to come back. I wish there was more descriptions of the items on the menu because I had no idea what a majority of them were."}
{"text":"We've been to Virtu and loved it! Nicos is even better! We  that menu had changed since the opening of the restaurant: many new dishes and gluten free signage next to each dish! So now it doesn't feel like we go to Virtu:) great service, excellent food, and an amazing ambiance."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Nicos!! Keely was our server and she was VERY enthusiastic! She had great suggestions! I had the italian sausage pasta and ordered the Piedmont! My friend and I shared the sticky toffee chocolate cake (OMFG) and had an espresso! I would recommend this to anyone that wants  decadence and deliciousness. If your gonna bat an eye at the prices, you don't deserve to indulge in the wonder!"}
{"text":"Interesting dining concept....we had the lasagne and the basic spaghetti. Both portions were small and reasonably priced at 13 &14.00 but definitely packed heavy flavor. Definitely tasted like an old recipe your gramma made.  Our bill was 32.00 before tip for the lasagne, basic spaghetti and a coke, so i can imagine appetizer and drinks running you into the 55-60 range before tip. Definitely something to think about.  Great taste and service overall but out of my price range and portion size to be a repeat cutomer. Perfect for the old town gilbert hipster experience though. Come october....i steer clear of the area until the following summer."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Service was spot on as well. The restaurant is loud inside during busy times.  if you have difficulty in noisy environments Ask for an outside table.  We tried the lasagna and rigatoni- both yummy.  Coffee is very good too!"}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere in this place. Waitress was friendly. I've eaten here before for restaurant week and I enjoyed it . This time I came for breakfast. I like how they have the breakfast menu available till 1500. I got the ricotta lemon pancakes. It was good! Just really heavy. I could only finish one pancake. Sides are ordered a la carte at 5 bucks each however the serving are huge so it's worth. The coffee here is really good too the waitress was prompt in refilling our cups."}
{"text":"Happened on this restaurant in downtown Gilbert on a busy Friday night.  While we didn't have reservations, the staff was more than accommodating and was able to seat us in a matter of minutes.    The food was fresh, made from scratch and absolutely delicious.  The chef's take on some traditional Italian dishes was creative and the food most definitely exceeded our expectations.    Our party of 5 enjoyed the salads, lasagne, rigatoni and Brussel sprouts.  Our server, Toby, was friendly, professional and attentive without being intrusive.  We are most definitely returning."}
{"text":"Simply the best, nothing more, nothing less! Food is unbelievable, this should have 5 stars across the board. Sunday brunch, $10 bottomless Mimosas. Do not pass on trying their food!"}
{"text":"We shared their Grilled Cheese sandwich for lunch today.  It was awesome, best I have ever eaten.  Michelle was our server, she was quite helpful and made some great suggestions.  We also had the Butterscotch pudding, very decadent.  We plan on returning soon, it was quite a treat."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Nico Heirloom Kitchen almost by accident, and I'm glad I did. It should be noted, however, that I have only been for brunch. First, $10 bottomless mimosas and bellinis -- seriously, and they're really good too! While these drinks are a serious deal, the food is a bit pricey. However, it is really delicious and so fresh. The atmosphere and decor are also great! I will be back to Nico very soon."}
{"text":"Visited Nico for the first time last night.  Friends came to visit from out of town and since I wanted to try Nico and they are Italian... Our server was EXCELLENT!I didn't quite get her name because this restaurant is SO VERY LOUD!!!!  No, really.  We could not talk at all. We were SHOUTING.  So, when this happens the food rules, right?  We ordered two of the signature appetizers, Octopus and Asparagus.  Our server talked them up big time. She was so very good.  The asparagus was ok.  Candied bacon, over easy egg, goat cheese but just ok.  However, my usual absolute favorite, octopus, was a huge disappointment.  Almost burnt, in fact, the little bits were burned.  OK, on to the Bobby Flay challenge of the wood fired pizza.  I see why he lost.  The meat was so soft without any texture.  It was extremely salty.  Our server described a fantastic dish but it was not served.  Did I mention the noise level?  Will not return.  There are too, too many great restaurants in Gilbert for a repeat at this establishment."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with Nico heirloom kitchen. I ordered the Prosecco my companion ordered the Lambrusco. The glasses were tall and full which makes for a great start. For an appetizer we had the buratta. It was just OK. The weird Parmesan cracker they gave to us with it had a strange flavor. We ordered two entrées, the Seabass and the veal. Seabass was amazing and the veal was just OK. I always forget that I like veal Paired with buttery and lemon type sauces than with a rich marsala sauce. Just my personal preference. It was cooked fine though. Service was spectacular and the ambience was great. Just note, not a very kid friendly atmosphere. I received a lot of dirty looks from other patrons because I brought my child there. Also, it was a little pricey not too bad for great food but it was over $100 for two adults and a child and a few drinks. Will be back and order something different. Lots of interesting stuff on the menu"}
{"text":"We dined here last evening for our anniversary. The atmosphere and service were great. We had the Grilled Caesar Salad, which was wonderful. Our wine was great, too. However, the entrees were mediocre at best. I had the salmon, which was dry and overlooked as were the veggies that came with it.  My husband had the sea bass, which was dry and tasteless. We ordered 2 sides, the smashed potatoes and the spinach. The spinach was very good, but the potatoes looked and tasted like left over mashed potatoes heated in burnt butter. We did get a complementary dessert, peanut butter bomb, that was great. I had high expectations from family that had been there and the Yelp reviews. Maybe we were there on a night the Chef was off."}
{"text":"Great service and great atmosphere. Their food is delicious as well. Great octopus dish and a great burger"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Came here for birthday brunch with family. French onion burgers were extremely over cooked and flavorless, had a drop of aioli and minimal onions. Pork ragu was better, polenta was creamy. Ambiance was lovely but expected much more from an establishment that claims to created by a culinary legend. You will find better burgers next door.  Was hoping for a fantastic local spot but cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with my experience from the service to the food. Perhaps I had too high of expectations after reading the reviews.   SERVICE - We had a party of four and made our reservation online through Open Table. Our table was available when I arrived, which was up against the closed garage door. The table was situated in such a way that servers were constantly bumping into my chair as they navigated through the the area. Drinks weren't refilled without asking and plates were not cleared until after we made payment on the check (even then, only two of the four plates were left)  FOOD - We started with the octopus appetizer based on reviews and the fact that we are lovers of octopus! :) With four of us sharing a single appetizer, we found that we had \"leftovers\" that nobody was eager to gobble up.  I ordered the Lasagna al forno bolognese, as it was highlighted that it was seen on Food Network's \"Beat Bobby Flay\". It arrived piping hot, so much so that I couldn't eat it for quite some time. Once I was able to dig in, I was disappointed. The only flavor that was prominent to me was the garlic and it lacked the layers of flavor that one would hope lasagna to have. Others at the table had salmon, roasted chicken and sea bass and all felt that while good, it was average for the price point.   All in all, it is a decent spot for dinner, however I find in Downtown Gilbert, there are better food places that cost much less."}
{"text":"The food was out of this world (had the octopus appetizer and the chicken for dinner). Plus, the place is really nice (maybe a tad crowded) inside, and the wait staff was excellent! Try the pink sangria if you like slightly sweet - it's rose, fin, and st Germaine, and it's delicious. We brought parents for my mom's birthday and the restaurant lets you take your pick of the dessert menu for a free birthday treat. My parents' only complaint was that the chairs aren't the most comfortable. Other than that, they loved it too!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some previous coworkers to catch up.  We had a reservation as we heard it can get busy on Friday nights.  It really wasn't too busy, which I guess should have been our first sign.  We were seated at a great table on the patio which is the only thing that made the dinner even bearable.  We were there for at least 15 mins before we finally flagged down a bus boy and asked for out waiter to at least get waters.  Waiter came in about 5 minutes, and seemed nice enough.  But we would soon learn he was absolutely terrible.  We got waters and our first round of drinks about 10 mins later.  We ordered apps right away, worried already at the timeline.  We got the 'famed' octopus, which was BURNT and really just kind of awful.  Took another 10 mins to get silverware to even eat the apps.  Ordered food, I got the 'famed' Lasange and one person got the risotto special (he was the only person that ate/enjoyed his food).  The other 2 got the pappardelle that was supposed to have steak tips and mushrooms in it.  They both received with almost no mushrooms and only one got a steak tip.  And I mean A steak tip.  They also said the pasta tasted like paste?  The waiter at least comped their meals.  I TRULY wished I had complained about mine, it was gross and I did not eat more than a couple bites.  It was all what seemed like ground meat and bread crumbs.  I really couldn't find anything else in the dish but some cheese.  Will NEVER go back again, damn, $35 for one meal I threw away and one drink.  Drink was ok at least.  :'(  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Well served and delicious.  The veg was way over-salted which they replaced.  The wait was not too bad on a Friday night early.  Many of the places on Gilbert rd are overrated -  this one is worth every cent."}
{"text":"Wednesday night, 5 PM reservation. Service was slow and it took about an hour to get our food (only 3 people in the restaurant at the time). Food was underwhelming. Had the lasagna that went against Bobby Fly apparently. Not what I expected and very bland tasting. Per the server, chef said they were out of chicken and cannelloni at the time. For a limited menu they have, not sure how happy one can be with limited choices. They did provide free desert, which was underwhelming as well. We didn't finish them, paid and left. By the way, my food didn't look anything like the pictures being posted. Presentation was a bowl on a plate with lasagna inside--no garnish, no nothing. Hmmm."}
{"text":"Went to Happy Hour here a couple days ago with my girlfriends and can't wait to go back!! The ambiance of this place is really posh and trendy - I loved all the décor inside. The service was also outstanding. Ivan was our server and he was great!  The food, for the most part, was great but there were a couple misses. I've listed below what we tried:  Garlic Fries with Calabrese Chile Aioli - These were so good. The dipping sauce was an A+  Gorgonzola Bruschettone - This was okay but had a lot going on... Gorgonzola, apples, figs, balsamic... There were just a lot of flavors fighting each other in my mouth. Still pretty good though!  Meatball Sliders- I didn't care for these. They were a bit dry and I like meatballs when they are super soft/juicy etc. I didn't taste much flavor either.  Penne Sugo - This pasta was to die for. Love. I could have this every night for dinner, that's how good it was.  Prosciutto & Grissini - The prosciutto was great but we didn't care for the pretzel type breadsticks that came with it... Would rather just have a normal cracker or fresh bread instead!  My friend also got a drink called the Conquistador and she loved it. Definitely come check this out if you're looking for a fun happy hour in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We have heard about this restaurant opening up last week so my husband and I decided to try it on our date night. We are so glad we did! This beautiful restaurant is located between the ice cream shop and Chicken & Waffle, seriously, who would have thought that a restaurant like Nico Heirloom Kitchen would be located between two basic places.  You can tell that they must have spend quite a budget on the decor, the building is beautiful. I love the colors they used and the mirrors on the right wall are just breathtaking. We started by ordering a bottle of Rose from Spain, it was very good, more on the dry side, the way the hubby likes it! We talked, talked, talked and talked. We were sitting on the patio, the weather was just perfect that night.  We then decided to try an appetizer, the Wood Fired Octopus. It was delicious and the portion was quite nice! The octopus was so tender, it was almost melting in your mouth. It came with a little chipotle butter, just perfect!  We weren't too hungry so we decided to skip the main courses and go straight for the desert. We took the pistachio dessert with the honey mousse and fresh peaches. Once again, it was amazingly good. Next time we come, we need to try some main courses. But other than that, we are glad that a nice restaurant opened up on Gilbert road, what a change !"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Bomb-bay brown buttered French toast!!! It melts in your mouth! They use a baguette bread for the French toast. The brown butter comps it so well! This time the the slices were a little bigger, so I just picked it up & ate it#No knife & fork required! I tried to use the knife and fork, but it wasn't cutting the pieces right. Just pick it up to eat it! Check out the pictures to see what I'm talking about.   The bacon was cooked to perfection! It was crispy and very flavorful! The lemonade was pretty good. For that $4 glass, you don't get free refills. I remember from the first time I went. The sticky toffee cake was good, but I remember it being more dense and flavorful the first time. My server was awesome! This is a nice brunch hot spot!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in downtown Gilbert. I met an associate here for lunch and had a very enjoyable experience. The food was delicious and the atmosphere is fun and open. They have a very unique menu. Dessert was great too. Both of the meals served to our table were delicious. Nico adds some extra touches you don't find at most restaurants. Our server was very friendly, and the manager greeted us as well. Don't fret about parking, drive around back and there's plenty of parking. Great value too."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this morning and we will for sure be going back! Bottomless mimosas for $10, what more can I say. I had the French toast and it was amazing. Service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Great food but why the TV's?  This is what I would consider more upscale and the TV's are just off."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful & the service is great.  The food, sadly, is not as awesome.  The calamari is some of the best I've had in the valley.  Truly delicious.   The pasta chips are decent, but nothing to rave about.  The lasagna/rigatoni/baked pasta thing was overlooked & bland.  The sauce lacked flavor & depth.  The veal chop was too thick, over cooked & bland as well.  It lacked any sort of sauce to pull the dish together.  The apples with the veal were an odd choice as well.   The spumoni was good, but the other dessert was a complete throw away after thought.  A rocks glass full of whipped cream with sliced peaches & MORE apples.   I had such high hopes for this place, but was disappointed.  I would go back for the calamari though.  It was really delicious."}
{"text":"Gio Osso: this dude is the truth. Food is another level. Great atmosphere. Cocktails list is short, but selections are well-designed. Wine list has nice Old World with some great Cali selections that many industry people and true wine enjoyers will recognize and appreciate. Remember, this is Italian the right way. Most wines will go with most food here for me.   Gio's food has delicate layers of flavor and texture, but make no mistake, a lot of it is heavy duty.  Timballa. Lasagna.  These dishes are over-the-top in all the right ways. The ways the make going out for dinner worth every penny. Polenta board. Octopus here is the best you'll find. Ton of desserts made in house. Sabayon is simple but decadent. Cannoli might as well be the best I've had. Everything that can't be raised or grown, is made in house.  Price point is amazingly affordable for the quality.  Pastas $10-$15, $20-$25 on entrees (minus the tomahawk steak for 2). There is so many ways to go about enjoying this food. Desserts and espresso or drinks. Full on celebration. Bounce around tasting.   Gio is a person that will give more of himself in a busy weekend, than most people will in a year at their jobs. Every plate. Every drink. Every guest. Every table. World class chef that is humble as they get. But passionate as they get when it comes to quality. Nothing gets by him. Heidi was an awesome server. His staff is the kind that will evolve to learn what he has learned. Appreciate the detail that he appreciates. But most of all, they will be people, like him, that appreciate the spirit of Italian: great eating and drinking graciously served as if you're guests in their home. Let them guide you. Gilbert has no idea what's landed at their doorstep. Yet!"}
{"text":"I just moved back to Gilbert and we decided to give Nico Heirloom Kitchen a go based on the amazing reviews. We walked in and grabbed a patio spot. Our server Diane was great! She offered great recommendations and took the time to chat with us. We ended up ordering the Sangria, Tuna Appetizer and Short Ribs. All perfect recommendations. Thank you Diane for your amazing customer service! I will be telling all of my friends and family to check this place out because of our fantastic first impression. Also a major plus that you are dog friendly I will be bringing my pup with me next time!"}
{"text":"We finally got to Nico's and glad we did.  Their were 4 of us so we did a lot of sharing.  The Octopus appetizer was excellent.  Great flavor profile and the Octopus was super tender.  We also had the polenta with the pulled pork which was perfect.  The pork had a great flavor and the polenta was just right with a delicious cheese undertone.  For the main course, we had Rigatoni with the same fantastic pork as on the appetizer along with Al Dente pasta.  I had the Branzino also served with the polenta from the appetizer.  Everything was great.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 was the noise level which is quite loud but not loud enough to keep us from a return trip."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, incredible staff. The food was very yummy but very rich. This is the kind of food you eat and then go Netflix and chill, not that you eat and then go dancing at whiskey row. The lasagna is amazing- must try."}
{"text":"Great night here with my sisters and Aunt. Walked over to Nico after seeing the matinee at the Hale theatre. It was such a great experience Shiloh was our server and everything he suggested was delicious! The Brussel Sprouts were easily the tables favorite dish! But everything was good till the last bite. Thanks for ending our girls night on a high note!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Thursday night. The spinach papardelle was amazing. It's a pasta dish that is Fresh and delicious from the house made pasta to the freshly sliced parmesan cheese. The drinks were fantastic.  I had the Soda Pascal. I liked it so much I had a second. Amazing. My wife had the same dish as me, but she was drinking the Nico Spritz. WOW is that good! The service was excellent. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition the the Gilbert food scene.  I got there as the happy hour was about to end so we ordered a few craft cocktails I can't recall the names of, however they were really good.  We also had the bruschetta and the meatball sliders.....both delicious. After a few more drinks, beers and an excellent negroni, I had the filet mignon and my buddy had a pasta dish ( I tried it, excellent).  We both agreed it was superb.  The filet had a crust, which I usually don't enjoy but I always try to let the chef do his thing and it was a big win.  At $25 the filet was a steal and I will be coming back for more.  It might make it hard to try other option on my return visit. Overall, I couldn't recommend this place more. Our waiter Doug was great.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"09/01/16  It was Mom & my first venture to Nico Heirloom Kitchen, & it definitely will not be our last!  Took our coworker Lisa with us for brunch, & all but Mom enjoyed our chosen entree .  I didn't get to sample the other two selections, because I wanted to devote my tastebuds to the magnificence that was called Browned butter French toast! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=5YvRn800KH1XfPHDzBnyVA  Aside from the half of one toast I gave to friend Lisa, I ate the rest of the pieces-- OMGoodness, indeed better than you-know-what.  The slices, made with Noble bread, were topped with cinnamon peaches, toffee, & mascarpone.  A bowl of fruit came with all the entrees, but they went untouched-- the pieces I tried weren't ripe enough.  I will try the lemon-ricotta pancakes next, with a side order of the French toast, I kid you not!  Mom couldn't decide on the Steak & Eggs https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=cpazPAk5HscxFas7nXO5RA & Nico benedict (bene being one of her favorite breakfast selections when we dine out), so Lisa decided to switch from her original choice of French toast to the benedict, https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=wgndTPO79JOdw-VpFDwO5A while Mom chose the Steak & Eggs, & I chose a favorite breakfast item of mine.  A few minutes after we'd placed our orders, Lisa wanted a side of breakfast potatoes, too. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=6XLCPIY8iu3eyAHh0tIOIA  For beverages, I chose a cappuccino, while Mom had drip coffee and Lisa went with just water.  (She & Mom love flavored creamer, but Nico does not offer anything but whole and 2% milk, as well as heavy whipping cream, so Lisa declined, while Mom tried both whole milk & the cream.  In the end, she enjoyed the last third of my cappuccino, to which she added Splenda, since I don't add sugar to my coffee selections.)  This cappuccino was one of the best caps I've experienced! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=KXot-UPB1SIWYsTMycGzHA  When I saw it presented on a Miscela d'Oro latte & saucer, I knew I was in for a great treat!  I mean, look at it!  How can something that gorgeous NOT be exquisite in taste?? https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=WijA4_hGt5I5NJlxqTBEwQ  Paired with the French toast, not even the rumbling of a possible storm brewing between Mom & our server* could bring me down from my happy clouds!  Mom did not enjoy her Steak & Eggs, as she'd expected breakfast potatoes, not fries- a photo posted last month did not have fries in it.  Also, the steak was sliced, & Mom likes her steaks presented whole.  I know Lisa enjoyed the Nico benedict, even though both she & Mom thought the Calabrese hollandaise sauce was VERY spicy.  To our server's credit, we were given fair warning of the spiciness, but they both thought it was hotter than described.  Mom enjoyed the texture and consistency of the poached eggs, & the combo of mortadella, house-made focaccia, & especially the spinach.  The restaurant & restrooms were beautiful!  Since Mom & I have been looking at homes for three weeks now (with a week in between spent vacationing in Seattle), I thought it uncanny that NHK is just as beautifully-designed as the homes & hotel we've visited.  From the hardwood tables, brown leather booths, & gorgeously-hued dark blue metal chairs (although these looked uncomfortable to sit on), floor-to-ceiling glass & metal windows (do these open up like garage doors to let the outside in?), blue walls, splashes of cream & brown, gigantic tilted mirrors, & other interior design details, to even the rosemary sprigs tucked into the blue- & white-striped table napkins, Nico is a feast for the eyes!  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=LLHdkMx_nvD5UiZwIvMb4g  Its restrooms are equally-appointed, with lots of wood, glass, & even thick-slabbed granite/marble-looking sink counters!  (Were these real??  Oh, my!) https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nico-heirloom-kitchen-gilbert?select=N9t7WKgKidel_7v3RL1rWA  *We all felt that our server may have thought we were a handful due to my food allergy questions, our order switches, & inquiries into the dairy options for coffee.  Even if we were troubling her, it wasn't as if she had her hands full with other customers.  In fact, we were her only customers until we'd paid for our meals.  When Mom requested ketchup & out came this ramekin almost filled to the brim with said sauce, Mom said with an impish smile,\"that's too much!,\" I thought I saw our server gave her the evil eye before she backed off & pirouetted away.  I probably shouldn't have tipped more than 20%, but I was very happy with my breakfast and I was willing to forgive, but I don't know if Mom will want to return to NHK with me again in the near future.  Looking forward to returning again for more of that French toast!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 out of 5 I would. We got sat immediately but a waitress didn't come for about five minutes. Which is fine it's a Saturday night and it's busy. We put an appetizer in (the meatballs) after about fifteen minutes she came back to take our order (still hadn't gotten the appetizer) this was the last time we seen our waitress ... well till it was check time. We finally got our appetizer 30 minutes later and they were cold. They waitress in the next section was kind enough to refill our waters check on or food and clear our table (only good thing about tonight was her) almost an hour later our food was brought to the table, I got the rigatoni. It was cold and as I started eating taking a piece of the ricotta cheese from the center to put on a noodle I found a sold chunk of pork fat that was so tough I couldn't even pick it up with my fork to take it off my plate. The whole experience was frustrating and not worth the wait. The manager was kind enough to come speak with us which I truly appreciate him coming to speak to us to correct the wrong (that the waitress from the next section brought to his attention since we still had not seen or waitress) but I will not go back to this establishment nor will I recommend it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Alyssa R gave Teakwoods a four star review and complained there isn't a multi million dollar San Diego based brewery in Phoenix like every business is a franchise so please disregard her scathing, limp review. Nico kills it. Probably the only restaurant on Gilbert road where an actual culinary artist is employed. If you want pasta bowls as big as your head and free refills I highly recommend Oreganos. I'm going back and you're damn straight I'm going to try the octopus."}
{"text":"Great brunch experience.  Good food, friendly staff, both engaging and knowledgable.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The crepes...fantastic (and I am a French snob). The octopus...made perfectly. Can't beat the bottomless mimosas for $10 at brunch either. I will definitely be coming back. We are very new to the area and excited to find such a great place."}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown Gilbert, awesome vibe, and excellent service.  Food was excellent and got to watch the prosciutto being shaved in front of us!   My only drawback would be the wine prices.  With Postino's down the road it would be nice to not have to order a glass of wine that is the same price as the entrees.  Not lower prices, but maybe a larger selection."}
{"text":"Well we all know that downtown Gilbert has exploded over the last couple of years. There are a ton of great restaurants here and the competition is fierce. Nico's is probably a little pricier than most others nearby but they are still a great choice because they have truly fantastic food. I have only been here a couple of times but I was not disappointed. It has become my sister's choice for a \"special occasion\" place so I am sure I will be back again in the future."}
{"text":"Was looking for an authentic Italian restaurant with all the components of a good eatery, and via all my research I chose Nico's to meet a girlfriend that I hadn't seen in years, for light bites.   Nico is trendy and very creative with decor detail, our server was sweet and hospitable as they should be as we were the only guest.   The light bites were outstanding & definitely makes me think about how good of a return would be to indulge in their main dishes with my Don Dolce in the future as AZ is our home away from home.  Two things wrong you don't serve 5 hrs old coffee and assume the Queen won't know......dahling I'm not an amateur, when it comes to perfection, silly.  Last the owner himself was there, dahling you look charming & you make lovely succulent cuisine but it wouldn't have hurt for him to come & introduce himself or even ask if we enjoyed it, you are a Chef but in Gilbert AZ.  Ciao"}
{"text":"Yes and Yes.  A great addition to downtown Gilbert.  Walked in shortly after opening to beautiful decor and ambiance.  Although not a traditional breakfast place, the overall dining experience and quality of food & flavor was great.  Everything we had was a solid 4. - Coffee - Donuts with sweet milk - Nico Benedict - Steak & Eggs. - Virtu Octopus  Service was friendly and prompt and prices were fair.  We will be back and looking forward to their dinner service."}
{"text":"Heirloom kitchen- does this mean the recipes here are cherished family relics passed on from generation to generation? If so, I want to go to Nico's family reunion where they serve up mascarpone polenta and grilled octopus!  We came here for brunch around 9 on a Saturday and it was fairly empty, but when we left around 10:30-11 the restaurant was nearing capacity. The menu is pretty much the same brunch/lunch menu as the sibling restaurant Virtu in Scottsdale, with an assortment of delicious sounding items. We started with the Virtu octopus. It was a beautiful presentation (Just like at Virtu) with amazingly tender octopus, arugula and chickpeas. Unfortunately I did get a bit of grit when I chewed on some of the octopus pieces. For my main course I had the pork ragu and tried some other dishes at our table. The pork was a potent flavorful mixture combined with the rich, creamy polenta. It was a hefty meal and I could only finish about half of it. Other dishes that I tried were the eggs Benedict and the chistorra sausage which were both pleasing to the palate.  Service was good and we were checked up on as needed.   The interior is elegant, modern, with a more casual feel than at Virtu. Overall it was a good experience and a place I'd recommend to people that want a good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Loved my brunch date with hubby on the patio. Shared Nico Benedict, Spinach Salad and Pork Ragu because there were so many things we wanted to try. I'm just blown away at our Heritage District in Gilbert! The restaurants are worth a drive from anywhere in the valley!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The food was good but the service completely lacked. Clearly they have it together in the back of the house but the front of the house was an embarrassment for them. We went in for dinner to try it for our first time. That is the last time. Our waitress completely forgot about our cocktail order, then she never came back to ask us if we wanted another drink or refill our water."}
{"text":"While the place looks good, I can not recommend this place. I do, however, like the classical crossover music that played overhead. I was ignored at first, but eventually seated. I just had water and the penne sugo. The food was average in taste and just felt wrong and not worth the price. Everyone there really seemed cold and snooty. I was really wanting this place to be good."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! We have been looking forward to this place opening and it didn't disappoint! The service was impeccable and warm. We had the beef tartar to start....holy smokes it was buttery and wonderful. Our entrees were rich and delicious and then ended with the pistachio desert. Everything was clearly thought through and made with love. It's fine dining quality in a comfortable atmosphere. And the cocktails....oh the cocktails! Perfectly balanced and wonderful! We will be back and thank you for opening in Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"Come and try the grilled octopus appetizer. Any pasta you order will be delicious because it's fresh and al dente.   Shrimp Scampi is not your typical greasy oily sauce...the flavor is authentic and exquisite.   Lasagna ... yummy!"}
{"text":"I think it was quite coincidence how we found this place but I'm glad we did. From the moment we walked to into all the way to our leave , it was such an elegant and unique experience.   First off, the hospitality is one of the best within all components. Unique napkin design with that rosemary addition is quite genius. Simplicity but that elegance approach can be witnessed almost everywhere. Attention to details , utmost care about your experience in that restaurant is very much pleasing and rare when you compare to many other restaurants you can find in AZ.   Secondly, the restrooms. Now you might think why in the world would u share sth about their restrooms while I'm there food great food ? Simply cuz those candies :)   Last but not the least , is the food . I can write on and on but long story short : the food was simply amazing for a first time visit when you just try their pasta and salad and desert and coffee :) you will realize how righteous I'm when u visit .   Overall they are one of top 3 restaurants in AZ as of  today and I'm very happy with this coincidence :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Nico Heirloom kitchen twice this week and are so excited to see how the kitchen continues to turn out innovative and delightful cuisine. There are always new options as well as the tried and true favorites. Gilbert is truly blessed to have an establishment of this caliber,if you are ready to raise your bar try Nico soon. By the way ask for Nathan, a seasoned, knowledgeable server!"}
{"text":"Great date place!  I've been here twice now and it is a nice swanky style place. It's too bad people in AZ don't like to dress up because this is a place to dress up! The staff was great and the food was served hot and in a timely manner. The fire roasted veggies and smashed potatoes were delicious. The cocktails were also quite lovely."}
{"text":"Great food and well made drinks! Good deals on happy hour prices. Beautiful restaurant with great decor and open kitchen. Been here for both lunch and dinner and was never disappointed. Octopus is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is the place to splurge in the East Valley! Foodie heaven - the wood fired porchetta and charred lemon butter beans -  it's tender, balanced, succulent!!! Note - Porchetta is not for those watching fat. The burrata - melt in your mouth,  scoop the burrata. We loved the candy bacon, duck egg over grilled asparagus - excellent execution!!  Anything pork and wood fired grilled is DIVINE!! Great place and our server Grace was knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 for the drinks and a 2 for the food. Unimaginative food although the descriptions sound creative and amazing, The taste doesn't deliver. Bartenders were both great and really the cocktails were top notch. I would revisit as a drink stop not a dinner outing. Had the \"famous\" lasagna it was marginal, short ribs were overcooked and the polenta was bland. (Think cream of wheat) .... not worth the cost"}
{"text":"Great new spot! It has a trendy atmosphere, I loved the granite marble bar, blue bar stools and the classy purse hooks underneath the bar. It was rather slow upon my visit but that's to be expected on a summer Sunday evening. Once season hits, this place will surely be a hot weekend spot. Their caprese is unique in that they use fire roasted heirloom tomatoes (such a treat!) and serve it with arugula dusted with lemon juice and salt. The mozzarella wasn't my favorite, I typically prefer hand-pulled however, their burratta was incredible! It is served with house sliced prosciutto and fire roasted heirloom tomatoes. I had the pasta pomodoro and added two meatballs. Their pasta is house made and delicious! The meatballs were perfectly seasoned and perfectly tender. I couldn't have been more satisfied. They have a great cocktail and wine list to pair with your meal. I look forward to dining here again!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for a birthday dinner. The food was very good but I feel for the amount of food you get, it is overpriced.  I had the rigatoni ala vodka, $21.00.  No meat in it.   It did have great flavor but the portion was about a cup.  I mean a cup. That was disappointing. I dion't expect to get a ton of food but when you pay $21.00 for a pasta dish, you should at least get a good size portion.  I asked the waitress if there were any specials and she said, no, just the soup.  When we left, we see a board out front with specials. The bruschetta was fair.  We really love the Gilbert downtown area but probably would not return to Nico's."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is LITERALLY the best food in Gilbert. Thank you so much for opening!!! I would recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite in downtown Gilbert.  We are big fans of Virtu in Scottsdale and are thrilled to have many of our favorite dishes without the 40 minute drive.  The Virtu grilled octopus is spectacular.  The porchetta is so good it should be illegal.  I had the wood fired branzino.  I highly recommend it and if you do order it, do yourself a favor and do not discard the skin, it is the best part.  One of the best things about Nico's is they allow guests to make reservations.  It doesn't sound like a big deal, but in downtown Gilbert, restaurants that take reservations are virtually unheard of.  So nice to be treated like a civilized human being rather than be thrown into a makeshift corral (real or virtual) to wait hours on end for the dinner bell to ring.  By the way, the kids loved it as well.  They were treated as valued guests rather than a nuisance to be tolerated.  Did I mention I love this place?"}
{"text":"Love this place! First time here for brunch today and it was marvelous. I had the crepe with Parma ham, gruyere, eggs and mornay - superb with bottomless mimosas. Great service and ambience, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So I stumbled on this place after we were told it would be an hour to hour and a half wait at another breakfast spot on Gilbert Rd. And I must say I'm so glad we decided to skip the line and try something new! The food and service at Nico's were great! We tried a few items on the brunch menu and everything was delicious. My favorite was definitely the steak and eggs. The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, along with the garlic fries, SO good. The eggs Benedict was really good as well, and paired with the lemon ricotta pancakes OMG! The bottomless mimosas were great too. I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Great overall meal. Enjoyed their cocktails and pasta. Great atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and very attentive staff. The food was delicious and the drinks are creative and made with care. Great place to go with friends!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great restaurant to go to in Gilbert for seafood and to hang out with friends. I was introduced to it a few years ago and having been going back ever since. I have never been disappointed with whatever plate I have ordered. One of my favorites is the grilled octopus. So yummy. Great for sharing or just hogging it all for yourself. I have not yet been there for there brunch but some friends have gone and rave about the bottomless mimosas. Can't wait to partake."}
{"text":"Good and unique food, I like the brunch as well. Cute interior- fun for night out with friends or date night"}
{"text":"Very good food. Good staff. Comfortable restaurant. We enjoyed sitting outside. Will come back. My only issue is that at these fine dining entree prices, bread really should be served when seated. But was not. So on that note, I'd come back but not go for the expensive entrees (over $20)."}
{"text":"I love the addition of this place to the downtown area. The food was very good and there were a lot of tasty options to chose from. I had a pasta dish and the pasta was perfectly hand made and tasted delicate and delicious. The drinks were crafty and very smooth. I will certainly be back and wouldn't decline an offer to eat here! It is a little noisy, but that is to be expected at most popular restaurants."}
{"text":"I went with a friend of mine and her mom on Tues. of this week. The service was probably one of the worst experiences I have had in a while at a restaurant. The waitress forgot to bring out our drinks and we waited probably a good 20-30 min. just to get menus. It did not stop there, it took forever to get our food and she did not even bring us out bread or care to let us know that they were running behind it is like she completely disappeared. We ordered a salad which was good, the octopus appetizer which was amazing and the lasagna and rigatoni pork dish which was quite amazing.  I enjoyed the food but for the price you are paying (we spent around $30 each or more with 1 drink, the total bill was around $90 for three people),  I would expect better service. It is too bad because I was really looking for to going here since I had heard so many people rave about it."}
{"text":"Good food, well prepared and well served. Great to find real Italian-style food in Arizona. It's always on the list of where to go..."}
{"text":"Inspired and simple.  Gilbert needs a place like this.  I wish that they had some more homemade pasta dishes.  But the service is fantastic and the food is fresh.  I have been there twice in 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends here last night.  Pretty much same scene/vibe as every other restaurant in Gilbert.  Not sure I liked the seating, I'm a tiny girl and felt like the seats were small and pretty uncomfortable.  The service was good,  our server was very informative and knew the menu very well.  The octopus app was even better than what I ever could've expected.  I ordered the sea bass- amazing! My friend ordered the filet which she normally doesn't get but since it came highly recommended,  she tried it and loved it. The other two ordered pasta,  neither was impressed,  both said it was average at best.  For gilbert the food is good but I'd still drive to Scottdale or phoenix given a choice for more options."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food was outstanding, atmosphere is beautiful, and the wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. We started off the night with the octopus appetizer, which was cooked to perfection. I can honestly say it was one of the best appetizers I've ever had. For entrees, my partner and I shared the flat iron steak, and a pasta dish with pork sugo. Both were fantastic.  I've been to most of the restaurants in downtown Gilbert, and the experience I had here definitely tops the list. I'm excited to try other dishes on their menu!"}
{"text":"Just got finished with one of the best meals I've ever had. We ordered the octopus for an appetizer and it was phenomenal. I had the filet mignon and the server brought a side of polenta to dip the filet in at no extra cost (highly recommend that) and couldn't have been more satisfied. I've been to double eagle steakhouses all across the US and gourmet restaurants in France and Switzerland and I'd put that filet I had up against any of them. Wifey had the sea bass and loved it. She had a Pinot Grigio and I a Syrah and both were excellent. We finished the meal with the flourless chocolate friggin masterpiece dessert and left not a scrap. Those that had a poor experience I'd highly recommend you try again as it was an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. All of the food is fresh and the pasta is hand made. So yummy! I love their mixed drinks and they have a good wine selection. Their food is worth the price. The atmosphere is awesome. Great staff and service every time."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on our way to Maggiano's in Scottsdale when we suddenly changed our minds and decided to try something new.   We ordered: App - Octopus, Entrees - Sea Bass and Scampi Pasta, Drinks - Rosé.  The Octopus was $20 and was literally just one tentacle and a lump of arugula, which to be fair, was very well cooked but the portion was minute. I've eaten octopus in many different destination such as Cyprus, Miami, London, Malibu, Mazatlan, Rocky Point and none of them were served in such a minuscule manner.   The Sea Bass looked like two tiny Tilapia fillets served with, again, arugula. It tasted fine but at $24 I expected a larger portion.   The Scampi pasta was literally 5 pieces of shrimp in spaghetti - the spaghetti was actually home made and very tasty but again $24 for 5 pieces of strip is a joke.   The Rosé was poured in-front of us and the lady didn't fill our glasses.   Am I being fussy of does this place have some serious portion control? lol"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The service was great, attentive and on the spot. The food was marginal at best. My rigatoni was overcooked and dry, another member of our group had ordered the chicken and it was served dry and overcooked and was sent back. The meatball appetizer was great and enjoyed by all, unfortunately, the entree's left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We love Nico! Been twice for dinner and had great experiences. Their coffee drinks are also delicious. I finished my meal with an Irish coffee and it was definitely the best I've had.  This weekend we decided to try brunch for the first time. I would highly recommend the classic crepe, it was wonderful.  The brown butter french toast was delicious, but just too sweet for me.  One piece was plenty (comes with 4 pieces). Also, the bread they used was too hard, we couldn't even cut through it.  My main complaint about brunch (hopefully an isolated incident)...There was a guest who brought his dog with him. He was letting his dog sit on the patio sofa cushions, you know...where humans belong. I am a \"dog-person\" and have a dog on my own, but out of respect for others in an EATING establishment, I would keep my pupper on the ground. To make it worse, the waitress went over and was petting it...and then came straight to our table to take our orders. Wash your hands!!! When I served tables, we had to wash our hands even if we touched our own hair. It grossed us out and put a damper on our meal."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful but the food is a little lacking.   I came in with a larger group of friends for brunch and was happy to find no wait.  I ordered the Chistorra & Egg, which was roasted potatoes with portuguese sausage with a sunnyside egg on top. The food was very meh. The sausage was very thin and so when it came in the hot skillet, half were burnt. The rest were cooked fine but wasn't really seasoned well. Overall, I was very unimpressed with the food and it tasted very generic.   Despite the average food, the service was pretty nice, they were extremely accommodating when we switched from inside to the patio and were pretty attentive during our visit.   I've heard that their dinner items are better, so I would like to come back but for brunch, it will be a no for me."}
{"text":"Just had the worst meal between 4 people. I've been here before and mine and my husband's entrees were spectacular. Tonight's couldn't have been more opposite. I'm giving 2 stars for the decent bruschetta. First part was the server grabbed my water glass as I was drinking, to give me a refill. Thanks, but couldn't it have waited until after? Then, as I was halfway through my bruschetta piece, he took my plate away...thankfully my friend who didn't eat one just gave me hers.  Our entree came after every single other table received theirs, who were sat after us. The lasagna was missing pasta with over cooked cheese on top. The pasta alla vodka was cold, but tasty. My pork belly was all fat, absolutely inedible, and my other friend's salmon was so peppery she was coughing throughout the meal.  I am not one to post negative reviews but since we each paid $40 each, it should've been a better meal. Consider me very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Our waiter Nathan was very attentive and made good suggestions. I recommend the charred octopus, it was incredible. I had the carpaccio appetizer and was impressed. I will be back! I hope it stays open, but I also hope it doesn't get so busy that we can't get a table."}
{"text":"Nico is our favorite restaurant, and I have been dying to try the octopus from Virtú for so long now, and we finally tried it-AMAZING! Our server, Jessica was very sweet and helped us with the menu choices, and gave great recommendations.   We miss the steak with cherries! That was a favorite but still love the other things we try also! Sticky toffee chocolate cake has changed since we used to go, seems a bit more dry-also still a favorite dessert though!"}
{"text":"Must order the rigatoni and the lasagna. They were the 2 best Italian dishes I had in my life! The brushchetta is on a soft cornbread like bread that I wasn't crazy about. Love that they take reservations too!"}
{"text":"The Brussels sprouts is awesome, it's a consider a side dish with your meal, which everything is a la carte. It's cook with bacon  Other then the that the spaghetti was ok the a la carte meatballs, was well meatballs. We had 2 people that ordered the popular lasagna here and that was flavorful and really good, probably be the better choice if you come to this spot."}
{"text":"We chose Nico Heirloom Kitchen as the venue to celebrate my 50th birthday and couldn't be happier with the entire experience. The atmosphere was near perfect... sports on TV by the bar but the ambience in the dining room wasn't compromised. The wait staff was attentive and professional and knew the menu very well. Now, the food... it was obvious this wasn't a \"heat and server\" place. The presentation was outstanding and it tasted spectacular. I can't recommend it more, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Superb. From the service to the food. Everything was absolutely perfect. I am so impressed by the level of professionalism and the delicacy applied to each dish and the beverages. It was a truly a magical experience."}
{"text":"For the price of the menu we were expecting something amazing with great service. Walking in, we were barely acknowledged. They sat us and we got our drinks and waited 20 minutes for the waiter to come back to take our food order. We got the olive appetizer which was super salty for me, and we wished it was a softer bread. My husband got the lasagna, and it was extremely rich. I got a salad, which was good, but over-priced for what it was and how small it was.  When it came time for dessert we ran out of time because the service was so awful. We asked to get it to-go. They said it would be a $2 charge to get it to-go (seriously!!!) so we paid that. We got the date cake, which was this TINY little cake! Super good but not worth the $13 we paid for it. And to top it off, this place has no plasticware for the to go food. So we weren't sure why we paid $2 for!   3 stars only because they used pretty quality ingredients that tasted homemade. But price and service were horrible for what you got."}
{"text":"Man, this one was disappointing. We arrived for brunch, surprised there were so many tables available on a crowded downtown Sunday morning. The service was slow, but we were enjoying a lazy morning on the patio and went with it. The menu had changed from previous posts on here, but still looked interesting. We inquired about a kid-friendly version of anything for our 5 year old, and we were offered buttered noodles.  so that was a let down. We ordered the French toast and a traditional breakfast (and ya know, kids buttered noddles, for breakfast) and a few small things to share. Everything was mediocre, as someone mentioned previously fancy names for ordinary things, but the one worth writing about is the French toast. The French toast is two slices SWIMMING in sticky sweet sauce, drenched all over it. The side of fruit was covered in honey. It was all so sweet and sticky I couldn't eat it. I wish the descriptions had been clearer, just listing \"toffee\" and \"noble bread\" with no explanation of what's really going on sets people up for an unpleasant surprise. Oh, and the bottomless mimosas are super skinny tall glasses (think big enough for a single rose), and combined with the slow service, it would be tough to get your moneys worth there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is at a level well above anything in Gilbert and I would go as far to say the east valley as a whole.  If you have not been here yet, go make a reservation now.  It is a little more expensive then the other options in downtown gilbert, but well worth it.   Service was excellent.  Not only very friendly but knowledgable.  Nathan knew the menu completely, he knew how each dish was prepared what was in it, and what to recommend. Not only on the food menu but beverage as well.  He also knew the history of the restaurant and the chef and anything we might ask.  He anticipated our needs and really took exceptional care of us.  So thank you Nathan and all of the Nico staff for making our night special.   Downtown Gilbert has a lot of really good food, in many different varieties and types.  So when I say Nico's food was exceptionally good, it is not to discredit the many other wonderful restaurants near by.  But the food at Nico is at a different level by far.  You can tell the care that goes into each dish, not only in how its made and cooked but the presentation as well.   Nico is a five star restaurant, one of the caliber you would expect in Scottsdale, but with a semi-casual atmosphere.  Allowing you to be well taken care of, eat exceptionally well but also feel relaxed and enjoy yourself and your company.   We will be back for sure, and are already planing our next date night here.   Thank you Chef Osso for opening this restaurant in Gilbert, and thank you to Nathan and the staff for taking such good care of us."}
{"text":"I'm here all the time.hate the new menu .. it's only a matter of time before you can keep a restaurant open on octopus and foie gras asparagus I'm sorry I like the specials I like to seasonal changes but I haven't seen it in a very long time and all the good stuff that used to happen where is it nothing's come back around seasonally.. I'm bored. No good ipa.."}
{"text":"Very cute place, great decor.... Food inedible... Eggs were slimmy, potatoes were greasy, sausage was burnt. Mimosas are weak- 95%oj. Great service our girl was attentive and sweet. Everything was good except the food."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST dinner. The service was great. Atmosphere was beautiful. The food was perfect."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day and was blown away! Not only was the inside modern and comfortable, the service was friendly and fast. At first the menu scared me, consisting of a wide variety of dishes belonging to no particular genre or style. But after further evaluation Nico has simply put a twist on classic modern American dishes, and I especially enjoyed the Duck dish and homemade pasta. This is a must-try!"}
{"text":"The 4 of us went for my brother's birthday, I was the only one that tried Restaurant Week while the others ordered off the menu...  PROS The decor was simple and chic without trying to be overly trendy, music was just loud enough to have good energy Service was great, she was attentive and had great recommendations Octopus - same as Virtu just at way better prices, chickpeas and the sauce are a great touch for texture and flavor My fiancee and brother shared the Prime Rib for 2, it was so much protein that came with a tasty aioli and salad Loved the salted caramel profiteroles, generous with 3 of those bites  CONS My pasta which was more like a lasagna was good it just wasn't great  Will have to try HH next time"}
{"text":"I have been touring Gilbert Old Town every weekend for the vibrant restaurant scene. Nicos is one of my last stops. Before I go on my rant the positives are $10 bottomless Bellini and Mimosas. Totally worth it during brunch. However the brunch menu is limited. I'd like more options but enough to satisfy me. I had the Ragu with Polenta and it was good, after a dash of salt.  My rant is this, I dine with my 5 year old, picky as heck but she loves lettuce with ranch and good bread so that is my go to when we dine at places with limited kid options.  I said all she wants is lettuce, no toppings. They served her a classic Cesar with cheese and breadcrumbs. Now I have to pick it apart. They also brought her 1 slice of bread. She was satisfied with the meal, I mean how hard is bread and lettuce. My complaint is that they charged me $11.50 for the salad and $4 for a single slice of bread. Are you kidding me? Had I known I would've given her my bread that came with my meal. $15.50 for a kids meal is insane. Waiter  could've done better than that. Now I'm mad and not coming back. Don't go with kids!  Totally dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible experience. I joined my party and the waiter asked what I wanted to drink so I replied water. He looked at me and pointed at the table and walked away. When I was ordering I asked if there was any meat or dairy in the dish and I could tell he wasn't paying attention. The dish came out with cheese all over it and I kindly asked that I wanted it with no cheese. He defensively replied that I never said that. So he grabbed the plate and walked away and was extremely rude about it. He came back and said he would have to have them make something different because the sauce had dairy. The dish that came out was inedible. The sauce tasted like someone dumped a ton of pepper and a ton of salt and threw it onto undercooked noodles."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with 2 other adults. Called on the way at 6:15 pm and was told that they could seat us on patio. When we arrived, patio was full so they sat us inside after a 5-minute wait. The bar and restaurant were full and nicely decorated as a modern eatery or lounge. Server Jessica was attentive and we started with a bottle of Pinot Noir and tapenade brushetta. The olives were delicious but the bread, housemade focaccia, was unexpectedly soft. We decided on three entrees with promises to share. My crispy roasted chicken was moist but underseasoned and the accompanying parmesan potatoes were a variety of doneness. My friend's sea bass was overcooked and my husband's pork belly was undercooked. Neither salt nor pepper was on any of the tables. We declined dessert and the bill was $150. With all of the eating choices in downtown Gilbert, and all the new ones opening, Nico's will have to improve their game to stay competitive."}
{"text":"5 star food, service and ambience. Really great tasting fresh from scratch Italian cuisine. We had Salmon, Chicken, Pasta, and beef, and we all raved about the taste and tenderness. My pasta for example was freshly made and the accompanying sauces etc were amazing. We also had the grilled Caesar and Brussel sprouts to share. Just perfect. You'd pay double the prices in Scottsdale although Nico's isn't cheap. My only complaint is the chairs are horrible and our backs we aching.  Nice patio and beautiful inside."}
{"text":"Service was spectacular and food was awesome.  Octopus, tartar, pasta all beyond expectations.  This place lives up to the hype.  Will be heading back next week to try more."}
{"text":"If you're going for dinner, be sure to book a reservation.  We didn't have one and were told it was a 45 min wait.  About an hour and ten minutes later, we asked how much longer and we could tell by their reaction that they had forgotten about us.  Once they realized this, we were seated in about 5 minutes.  I had the flat iron steak, which was prepared well and tasty.  My wife had the seared tuna fish on special which was just okay.  Finished our meal with their s'mores tiramisu, which looked much better than it actually tasted.  Prices are a bit steep for what you get."}
{"text":"Grace is awesome and we seriously have never had service at this level.  My wife and I rarely get out but anytime we can we go to see Grace at Nicos we do.  She's the reason we eat and drink at Nicos."}
{"text":"I will start with the pros: We need a nice place in Gilbert We still need a nice place in Gilbert  The cons: The outside tables and chairs were soaked with water from the misters, had to reposition seating for us. The burrata cheese appetizer came with no bread or crackers, awkward. They only vegetarian dish they had on the menu was not available, it was only 6pm :( They offered 2 choices in its place: heirloom tomatoes with evoo and oregano (not even mozzarella with them) or the veggie plate which I ordered which consisted of roasted beets and that was all.  JIC you are not a vegetarian it is a disappointment when all you can eat is a appetizer for dinner. The guys had the branzino and the tuna which were very small portions.  Still hungry after dinner so on to the ice cream store which was right next to us,  they each had a chocolate shake to fill them up. May be alright place if you just want snack and a drink and you do not mind paying high dollar for it. Suggestions are bread with the meal, (cheap filler) and more sides with your main dishes. We are in Gilbert where people like to eat:)"}
{"text":"They gave me cold corn for my 22$ dish and it took 15 minutes to fix it... MY GRANDMA CAN MAKE HOT CORN....also... what kind of places charges for a birthday dessert?? Never going back."}
{"text":"Very good \"trendy\" food that will please a variety of people. I took a chance on the octopus and LOVED it. Service is wonderful and the decor is clean."}
{"text":"This is probably the most food forward establishment in Downtown Gilbert. All of the other places were \"Just ok\" or decent....they didn't suck. But it wasn't anything to write home about. But Nico Heirloom Kitchen looks like they take time and put effort into planning their menu. We had the grilled octopus fir an appetizer, and that was unique. The texture of the geilled octopi was unlike any I've had before. But being that it was grilled, the amount of smokiness detectable in the octopus while paired with the pepperiness of arugula.... it was a bit overwhelming for my tastebuds. For my entree I had the chicken that was a 1/4 chicken with sauce on it, laying on a bed of creamy polenta. It was so savory and rich, and it reminded me of comfort food meets haute couture dining. Very yummy. Generous portions (I had to box the rest up), and excellent service. We spent $90 between the octopus, my dish, an Old Fashioned, my hubby's dish which was the lasagna, which he thoroughly enjoyed, and a sprite...and a mochamisiu dessert which was excellent. It's pricey, but a nice choice for a special night out.  Nico Heirloom Kitchen definitely stands out in the sea of restaurants on Gilbert Rd."}
{"text":"I am super happy I was able to celebrate my birthday din din here with family and friends. Old Town Gilbert has definitely added a foodie gem to their list of restaurants in this neighborhood.  You wonder why Nico has such a high rating, well then do not wonder any longer and go! We started with the shrimp scampi and warm olives for appetizers. Extremely delicious and had a fun time sharing with my dinner party. A few of my guests ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken and it was the best chicken I have ever tasted!!! My mouth is still watering.  My sister was craving the lasagna and ate the entire plate. Could have licked it clean if she could :) I ordered the bone marrow and port belly. Every plate that came out of that kitchen was done right. I will definitely be coming back here more often now that we live close by. Thank you NICO! You have become one of my favorite restaurants in the east valley."}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert strikes again! This is my fifth visit to Nico's Heirloom Kitchen and every time has been a great one! I have not been disappointed during any visit for any reason. Instead NHK has exceeded my expectations. Whether you're going for brunch, lunch or dinner, you won't be unsatisfied.   The inside is clean with a mix of modern and vintage (how thats possible, just go see). You can sit inside or outside and the staff is very friendly. The dishes are all creative and delicious; however, can get pretty pricey with additional alcoholic beverages that get tagged on.   I wish I had a favorite dish that I could share about but every single one is fantastic! From sharing the \"Virtu Octopus\" to the \"Bistecca Tagliata (tomahawk steak),\" enjoying dishes like the \"Rigatoni\" or \"Short Ribs,\" you really can't go wrong!   If possible, order different dishes for your table just so you can try a little bit of everything! Also, if you want to save a some dinero, try their brunch options, all winners as well!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Monday and let me tell you what. Amazing the service was great and the foood was even better the pork rigatoni was out of this world"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Gilbert and there are some really good ones!  You can't go wrong with anything on their menu and Tim is a phenomenal waiter!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Decided to visit tonight based on reviews from fellow Yelpers. First, just FYI, the online menu is outdated and only an \"example\" of current offerings. We went wanting to try the steak tartar and duck, but neither is currently available.  We did try an asparagus appetizer that was incredible and their signature octopus dish was incredible. Not anything like what you would expect. If you go, give it a shot, it will blow your mind, and your taste buds. Service was fantastic! Grace was our server, she was knowledgeable, friendly, patient, gave great advice and was a pleasure. She rocked it.  They had a tasty looking cocktail menu too, but we stuck to wines this time around.  They also have a Sunday brunch that Grace told us is worth a try too, plus $10 bottomless mimosas isn't a bad deal either.  Worth a visit next time you hit downtown Gilbert"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Nico given how delicious Virtu is..... Nico delivered! This place was impressive. The only bad part? It's all the way in Gilbert! The husband and I came for happy hour. The cocktails here were legit...very tasty and fresh. The price was also fantastic (6$...can't beat that!). We each tried two cocktails and all 4 were winners. We also had a variety of their affordable happy hour food items- meatball sliders, regular sliders, fries, and tomato bruschetta....we also had to get the octopus. The octopus is just the same as the one at virtu....so good....tender, salty (in a good way), nice charr, and a good amount of freshness from the chickpeas and salad. The rest of the apps were also tasty, nothing to write home about, but worth trying especially for the price. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gilbert just has the best restaurants, I've been here twice now and I still haven't really been blown away by their menu.   They have a lot of fancy names for some of the items on their menu so I had no idea what some of the items are. What is gruyere? What is mascarpone polenta? I ordered the Pork Ragu. I think the polenta is basically like grits. The entree was good but not one of my favorites. And on another note they do have bottomless mimosas so that's a plus!   They have a cute outdoor patio and the customer service was good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to do brunch with the girls!  It is seriously good!  I get the chistorra with eggs and it is amazing!  If you like spicy ask for extra peppers on top!  The peppers are something very special, our waiter said the owner has them flown in from Italy.   The bottomless mimosas and Bellini's can't be beat!     They even change it up with different fruit purees like pear. Yum!"}
{"text":"What a gem this place is! I'll start off by saying that I love the decor of this place. It has such a warm modern Italian restaurant feel to it...reminds me of a place you'd find in like Boston or something. Whoever designed it did a really good job.   The food...A+! One of the things that sold me on this place was the fine print at the bottom of their menu: \"vegan options available.\"  When we asked what options there were, the servers were super polite and went and talked to the chef. I ordered pasta pomodoro topped with veggies. Super delicious!!   I like their food because it's not the typical heavy Italian food that makes you want to go and purge after...it's a perfectly-sized portion and it's on the lighter side. My pasta was cooked to perfection...al dente; sauce not too salty with super flavorful notes of tomato; and the veggies weren't over cooked...so fresh and flavorful.   No need for this restaurant to put salt and pepper on the table because their food doesn't need it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant for date night or a night out with friends.  Their food is fresh and elegant. Everything we have tried has been great.  Service is great and the atmosphere is really nice.  Super great location in downtown Gilbert and one of the few that takes reservations.  If you are looking forward to a nice Italian meal that doesn't feel like Olive Garden check this beautiful place out.  Absolutely wonderful!  Be brave order the octopus (so good!)"}
{"text":"We had planned to have brunch at Snooze which is right down the street. After finding a one hour wait at Snooze, we decide to find another place. We are so happy we stepped into NiCo. They have an amazing brunch menu that in my opinion, is far better than the menu at Snooze. It was also not crowded and we had no wait. Everyone in our party of four had a delicious brunch."}
{"text":"Best east valley restaurant hands down. This is Chef Gio Osso's new restaurant in Gilberts Heritage district and Gilbert is doing a fantastic job with securing top restaurants. This is a sister property to the one in Scottsdale, Virtu, which is an absolutely amazing place for foodies. A big difference though is the Gilbert eaterie has more seating and a much larger bar area, and the Gilbert location has a bigger emphasis on Italian food. Tried every appetizer and the octopus, burrata and meatballs were tops for us. All large portions. We went in for happy hour and 3 appetizers were like a dinner. Excellent Italian based wine list, friendly servers and top notch food will make you want to return soon!"}
{"text":"Great great great! Perfect meal and service on a special birthday night. We couldn't have asked for a better meal and experience. It was restaurant week so we took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu option and decided to share our plates so we each got some thing different. Every course was amazing and worth every bite. The regular menu looked amazing too and we look forward to trying the rest of the menu out the next time we go. Have a look at my pics for the menu options we tried.   Definitely worth a visit to savor the flavor of each and every bite."}
{"text":"So wonderful..had to wait due to popularity but this place was amazing ..loved it. Great food good service"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Though a bit discombobulated in the beginning, they made up for lost ground quickly. The meatballs were exceptional. Rich, handmade and flavorful. The octopus is a MUST. The pappardelle was also unbelievable. Great to have fine dining in our little town. Service was also good and our food arrived very quickly. Atmosphere is great although it was rather warm and stagnant in there... A few fans and keeping the AC moving would be ideal. Really looking forward to coming back.  Prices were reasonable as well considering the quality of the food.    To add to this - brunch is unreal. The classic crepe. Wow. Make sure you swap the cheese it comes with for goat cheese."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered the spaghetti, lasagne,and I had the timballo- the lasagne and timballo were both burnt on top I had to peel off the burnt cheese to get to anything edible! I was so hungry I ate it anyway! The spaghetti was sent back-no red pomodore sauce in sight and the lasagne was partially ate due to being hangry and at 8pm since it took awhile to get our food. The manager was great he apologized and brought us shrimp scampi and the\"homemade\" meatballs that went almost untouched except for the one bite we tried but it was also terrible! Thanks but no thanks won't be back there again!! Guess we should have ordered the flat iron steak?"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good...waitress was not attentive. The veal had was one piece tough...the other good. Ordered a cosmo, unusual wine glass, rather than  martini glass.  :( The sea bass had was very nicely prepared. Pasta was very light & v good! Eggplant dish plentiful!  Reluctant to bring us bread while waiting for food to arrive..really!! Prices moderately high."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. We came on a Sunday for bottemless mimosas and they are delicious!! I ordered the Nico Benedict and my husband ordered the skillet and holy cow.. delicious.. do yourself a favor and come here. If the food and drinks aren't enough to persuede you, the service will do it.. Andrew has the biggest smile while serving and makes you feel like family."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience the waitstaff was very attentive and the food was fantastic. The decor of the place is very nice. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"#500  My 500th review, my 100th review for the year, and 3,000th check-in overall, shall be on a wonderful brunch I had with some Yelpers! Thanks for the invite!  :D  When I first strolled into the restaurant with Ann R., we were welcomed by Karen W. and her cutest lil doggies! Like seriously, my heart hurts from all the fluffy cuteness.  We were joined by Kelley U. from California [Glad you came out, girly!], Adam A., his lovely wife Kat, their adorable puppers Kegogi, Aileen B., Janet, and Derrick.  Since being invited by Aileen a week ago, I had pretty much decided what to order a few days prior.  I want what she had!  Brown Butter French Toast [$12 - noble bread, toffee, cinnamon figs, and mascarpone] was ordered and devoured.  When it first got to the table, it was lightly crisp on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside.  And those figs... so delicious!  I know most people think of pumpkins for fall but figs are my favorite during autumn.  I wish there were more figs on that plate.  And let's not forget about that chunk of mascarpone... I'm such a fattie.  :x It also came with fruit.  It was a sunny and lovely brunch out on the patio.  Service was decent, the food was delicious, and I'd love to come back to try their lemon ricotta pancakes [I mean, lemon ricotta AND pistachios?  How can you not?]."}
{"text":"Brilliant. The experience was laid back but fun. The idea of a late brunch on Sunday afternoon that incorporated rich wonderful Pasta dishes was great. I need to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing atmosphere along with phenomenal food. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The Octopus which is a specialty dish was outstanding along with everything else we had. The waitor was just as great."}
{"text":"Awesome place. We went for brunch. Had the pork ragu which I would highly recommend. We asked if they could make a Nutella crepe even though it was no longer on the menu, and glad we did. Turned out perfect. Will eat here again. Great service. Couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"It's wonderful to go to a restaurant that has different food combinations and tastes then the usual run of the mill restaurants. They seem to use better and more diverse ingredients. I enjoyed the crepes very much. My granddaughter was happy with the cinnamon fig French toast. We had the delicious toffee cake for dessert. My husband tried the meatball sandwich and neither of us liked the taste of the Meatballs. But we appreciate it the good ingredients and the fact that they were doing different things. This restaurant is particularly good 4 more sophisticated tastes."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy a breakfast on a July 4th weekend. Since this place was broadcasted on Ch.10 news and it is relatively close to me, I wanted to give it a try on a Sunday morning.   The restaurant is beautifully decorated. I love the brick walls with huge mirrors hanging against the walls. The windows were so tall from the top of the ceiling that goes all the way to the bottom. It allows lots of lighting to come in as though you were enjoying breakfast outdoor. I also love the open kitchen and the glass wall allowing me to see what goes on in there on my way to the restroom. Speaking of restroom, it is extremely clean and well decorated with beautiful mirror frame, fancy soup to wash your hand with and huge basket for you to toss your papers in. It also has a small table for you to leave your purse on. how thoughtful of them.   For brunch, we ordered their famous cinnamon roll, classic crepes as well as Nico benedict. Their cinnamon roll was super fresh and absolutely tasty. My classic crepes came with parma ham, gruyere, sunny side up eggs, mornay and snipped chives. Portion was generous. I could barely finished half of it. It was mighty tasty. I also took a bite of the Nico Benedict. The ham portion was thick with generous portion as well. I love the flavor ice-tea that they served here.  Service was great. We were greeted by a handsome bartender and our waitress was super nice. Overall, I enjoy my breakfast here. I will definitely come back here again to try their octopus. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
