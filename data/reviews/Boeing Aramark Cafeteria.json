{"text":"If there were negative Stars, I would give them out instead of one star. This place is a disgrace to anyone that likes even mediocre food. Breakfast used to be decent, but they hire, I assume, parolees or people on work release that worked in the prison chow hall. The \"omelet\" I ordered was a mess of veggies and some ham and cheese on the bottom of my plate. Why is there cheese on the bottom of my plate? Because the \"cook\", and I use that term VERY loosely, did not know how to make an omelet so he put the cheese on top of the eggs, and flipped the whole thing onto my plate. There used to be a good cook, but like most things around that kitchen, if they are good at their job, they get rid of them, you know, because people might like their food and come back. Boeing needs to really reassess their food service vendor and like someone else previously mentioned, do what Intel did, and hire a company that takes pride in their job. Boeing employees deserve better than this."}
{"text":"When I started working here, I was pretty lazy about bringing lunch, and the cafeteria food was decent enough to keep eating. Nothing really sucks, tastewise; I'll get a philly or Rueben as a guilty pleasure. However since bringing my lunch more consistently to save money, I've noticed something any time I eat the cafe food. I'll feel super bloated and lethargic and gross, almost guaranteed. Morning: feels great, After lunch: shirt doesn't fit. It seems pretty 20th century not to have a variety of healthy lunch options (not just a chicken sandwich or salad or 8$ fish). I'm thankful for this realization; as I'll think twice before getting the fried option now."}
{"text":"Total garbage. Its irritating that they have absolutely no problem taking advantage of the hard working Boeing employees. Mostly fried bar food, and anything that isn't unhealthy shit is ridiculously expensive. I made the mistake of getting 3 sausages (plain with mustard), a banana, and a diet coke. Any guesses on cost? About $19. Wow. Same with breakfast. 3 eggs? About $2.10. Not too bad. Throw some tomatoes and onions on? Now it's a $4 veggie omelette. Seriously, fuck this place. Boeing needs to fire Aramark. We're a Fortune 500 company. We can afford to take care of our employees. If Intel can do it, so can we."}
