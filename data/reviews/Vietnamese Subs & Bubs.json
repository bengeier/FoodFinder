{"text":"Delicious and a really great value!!! Counter service with a couple of window chairs. Take out and delivery available."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see a familiar face when I entered - a former server at another Vietnamese restaurant, one that treated me very well and always greets me with \"friend\". His service and general cheery disposition hasn't changed, and their food is definitely better than your average Vietnamese sub store offerings.  Though the selection may seem slim, it's all you'll really look for anyway and they make sure they do these few dishes well. They have a good selection of subs however, some even that you won't find in most other places.  You can't beat the price as well, especially with the size of the serving! On top of that, they offer a few other convenience store items such as gum, etc. making this shop a must-stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This business doesn't exist anymore. It's now a tiny convenience store with bags of chips and cigarettes."}
