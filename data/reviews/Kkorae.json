{"text":"A nice place to out and have a drink.  a very friendly and cozy  place. you can have Korean or Japanese style side order(called Anjoo in Korean) with beer, Sojoo or Sojoo cocktail, and rice wine. Chicken Garaage is a 'to die for' and Kkochi is also an excelleant choice. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Nope. No. Never. To a gazillion times- nope. 

I always pass this place on the way to my usual hot spots in Yonge and finch/sheppard, but I've never bothered to stop by here due to the abundance of smokers that block the door. Today was different, and I decided to stop by for a bite after work. 

As soon as I walked in, the vibe was .... I don't know, but it wasn't friendly. The server was nice though and seated us. Kkorae is dark, cozy and you can definitely tell who the outsiders are. Aka us, because we didn't just hop off the boat from Seoul. The girls here are loud, and I could barely hear my date over the obnoxious screaming in Korean and loud claps whenever they laugh. WHY! If you're a guy and you're turned on by this, my condolences. But I wouldn't chase your lead due to the heavy and obvious plastic surgery from the motherland. The guys are not better, always walking around the small restaurant and chatting with everyone they know (which seems to be everyone here) while blocking up the hallways. I'm not about it. Oh, did I mention the place is EXTREMELY small?! There's probably 6-7 tables SUPER CLOSE to each other. 

The prices are not great and certainly they're jacked up because they know mainland Koreans can afford it. One skewer of rice cake or other stuff is $3-5, although I must admit that the bacon wrapped dubboki is delish. We also got a plate of spicy chicken with cheese for $16, which is.. Meh. The spice was good, the cheese was melted but it didn't blow me away. The entire time after I ordered, I just wanted the food to come so I can leave and not get a billion dollar headache from these two flat face sisters that didn't know how to use their indoor voices if their life depended on it. 

That's the crowd here and that actually explains a lot about the crowd that gathers outside. Hell nah, don't think I would return ever."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and was told i was their first ever lunch customer! The waiter was extremely helpful with suggestions and even gave me a free mango milkshake and sushi rolls to try before i placed my order. This really helped make my decision. I had the cream cheese sushi rolls which were delish! They came with seaweed soup and house made spicy kimchi which was fantastic! I loved how fresh and tasty the food was, and how warm and invited the staff and atmosphere were! Definitely wld go back :)"}
