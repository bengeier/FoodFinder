{"text":"Great staff. The manager there is really nice and the DJ was awesome! Great place to have a family get together or a birthday party. The game room is really nice."}
{"text":"Very good food. Table service is handled by bar staff could be a little more attentive and  treat more as a restaurant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bowled in a league here a few years ago.  Always accommodating and great customer service every week.  The people working at the bar area always take care of you.  Lanes seem to be in good shape and oiled consistently.

Also a good place for kids birthday parties.  Kids love the bumper bowling, arcade and laser room.  They have pizza there and accommodate larger parties.  Bring in your own cake and they take care of the rest."}
{"text":"The company I work for had arranged for a team building bowling night, and we had chosen this location for our event. The day of the event, they waited till less than 2 hours beforehand to cancel our reservation, stating that their bowling league wanted to move the time up and there weren't enough lanes. We had 18 attendees ready to head out when they decided to give us a late heads up. There was also no offer of compensation for the inconvenience, just \" well we can reschedule for you\". Don't plan your parties here, they're all sorts of unprofessional."}
{"text":"Very family friendly.  Manager there does a great job and truly cares about true customer satisfaction!!! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am disgusted with the owner.  After scheduling a large (over 150 guest), milestone event for my son, the party planner quit. I was not notified about it, and when I happened to hear,I got in contact with the owner. 

We had already done lots of planning with the party planner and even signed a contract. The owner tried to convince us we didn't need to rent out as much space as planned and that she could \"save us money.\"

With 6 months left until the event, we had to reinvent the planning wheel with her and basically start over, since she had no accurate records of former plans. Then after several weeks, the owner finally got back to us with a new proposal that was for half the space of the original one at a cost of $3000 more!!! That's saving us money? When confronted, she blamed the former planner (her employee) and told us, \"I'm trying to work with you.\"  This of course is all coming from the owner. 

Needless to say it was very stressful and disappointing but was a blessing in disguise that we chose to find a new venue. I would never work with someone who runs her business this way and caution anyone considering it."}
{"text":"I give the bar 4 stars for great mixology. But the lanes themselves were in disrepair. I 1st lane the floors were so sticky that we were afraid we were going to sustain injury trying to bowl .When we mentioned this to management they did clean the lane and offer to wire brush our shoes to remedy the situation. When this did not help we were move to another lane . The location is undergoing a bit of construction and just opened a new game Room I believe their attention to this expansion has caused the wood floor area of the bowling alley to go unnoticed for a while. There was no shine and definitely a build-up of wax. On a positive note the bartender was amazing, the service was friendly and accommodating. Cosmic bowling was supposed to start at 5pm however, the DJ was full hour late. Was not a fan of the Disney movie soundtrack that played during that hour."}
{"text":"We went Bowling yesterday here.. The Bowling Alley is Beautiful and well maintained.. They offer a great experience and are expanding. 
My Family had a great time"}
{"text":"Between bowling, beer, pool, laser tag, and ninja warrior course. Hands down best place to go to for food and a good time in all of Solon or surrounding areas. Go there!"}
{"text":"Always super busy.  Food needs some work.  Needs a few more people to pick up tables after others leave.  Lots of video games weren't working.   They just need to hire some more people.

Do like that they have bumper guards for the kids and the video screens."}
{"text":"what can you say? it's a bowling alley. as bowling alley's go, it's pretty standard - and i'm not  fan of bowling. i went there today as part of what my employers call \"Engineering Day\", which is staff meetings, lunch and what is supposed to be a fun activity for the rest of the day (team building).
that said, the staff was excellent. we ordered pizzas and drinks (beers and sodas). they kept us stocked with drinks and pizza all afternoon - often checking on us to see if we needed refills. i'm not a fan of sausage pizzas, but i liked theirs and had 2 slices. 
i still don't understand why we drove all the way out to Solon for bowling when there are like 2 dozen within 15 miles of our office in Bath, but whatever. it was a good enough time and the staff made it an above average experience."}
{"text":"This review only refers to hosting a party, as I've never been there just to bowl on our own. I found the venue very clean and newly renovated. It took a few days and a few calls for me to finally get someone to help me book my party, but after that it was pretty easy. We ended up in the private area for our party, which was fun. The computerized scoring system was really easy to use, and the automatic bumpers were really cool. It was nice being able to program them for some kids, and not for the older ones. While our assigned helper for the day was really nice, he could not keep up. I did feel like we were waiting on food, drinks and more drinks all the time. I had to micromanage him and I really just wanted to relax and have fun. The kids who assist with these events really need to be trained better and there needs to be a more realistic timeline for serving events. Over all, though, it really was a great event."}
{"text":"So, are you looking for a place for;
1. Bowling?
2. Laser Tag?
3. Video Games (that give tickets, no less, for prizes!)
4. A laser MAZE?
5. Good Food?
6. Darts?
7. A good stiff drink with friends? 

Well...HOW ABOUT A PLACE WITH ALL THAT!? 
Oh, and they also have pool tables, lottery...AND A MINI-\"NINJA WARRIOR\" COURSE FOR THE BOLD! 

Yes, we were invited here after some friends got a groupon. We didn't know what to expect, but the place was really FANTASTIC! 
The games, laser tag, maze and all the prized are tied into a card system, that lets you not only use the cards to pay, but they keep track of your ticket winnings on cards so that, at the end of the night, you just take the card to the back table, and get your giant stuffed marshmallow with a face or whatever you'd like. No muss, no fuss, and no piles of wasted paper. 

In addition, we snacked at the restaurant within this great place, and the food was really great. Salads, sandwiches and all sorts of treats. They have a VERY full bar, along with drinks and snacks for the younger folks, and the bill was very reasonable. 

The laser tag area? HUGE. Two stories high, with lots of hidey holes and spots to blast your friends into good-natured oblivion!  (There's little traps too, shhhhh!) 

The bowling takes up about 15 lanes and is modern and fun, and if you want to have a party, they have a large party room along with some private lanes towards the back for your party to PARTY! 

Over all, add in the nice people running it, and I've gotta say, this place really is an all around party house for all ages! 

Lots of parking on adjacent lots, lots of space, and I have say, I'll the take the freeway to Freeway anytime!!"}
{"text":"Bowling with my friends is fun it's the 100th day of school I was 2nd place in bowling  I was with four friends. In the second game i won my friend said you gotta start it over. one of my friends is maybe making up that we are going to the arcade."}
{"text":"Eh. I wasn't too impressed with the Roll House. For starters there parking lot is small and confusing so I was already annoyed upon entering. I went on a Saturday night, I knew it would be busy but that was fine because it was family night out. We waited TWO hours for a bowling lane to open, only to get to the booth and find out it was $20 a person. That was almost $400 for the family we had and it wasn't about to happen, I would have appreciated if they told us well before we waited 2 hours. The girl at the counter was rude and was like \"you should have known this\" ummm no y'all should have signs for that no? Secondly, ordering food was a struggle. There was a counter to order from but when you go up to the counter they tell you to wait at a table for a waitress. We didn't get our drinks, the food was cold, the staff was annoyed and I get it cause they were busy but nah. They should have had way more staff. After getting cold food and soggy wings, crying kids because they couldn't now I had enough and went back to Cleveland and right to the bowling alleys I know so well. I won't be back until they separate themselves and figure out just what kind of establishment they are running. I felt like it was just a cluster of entertainment with no plan really thought out. They tried to be D&B, but tried to be a bowling alley mixed with a bar and pool hall. It didn't work."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place I feel like I've stepped into a time warp that's just transported me back to junior high.  And I love it.  I didn't grow up here but it always feels like this is a place I would go if I was thirteen, had no driver's license and no game.  Bowling is inexpensive and the game room is pretty sweet.  Also, four-sided air hockey?  Yes, please!"}
{"text":"\"Back in my day\", the bowling alleys I went to featured high levels of cigarette smoke, mostly stale beer, \"that guy\" you always thought was a little off, no music and someone who manually set-up your bowling pins and rolled the ball back to you on his own.  How times have changed! 

This place is extremely clean, vibrant, with neon lights, music and a ton of families.  They offer a full service bar and dining experience whether you are just strolling in to bowl or you have reserved lanes for a party.  They also offer an arcade area.  Plenty of activities for bowlers and non-bowlers.  The bar offers plenty of craft and macro beers on tap or in bottles.  I was impressed with the beer selection, plenty of IPA's, Christmas beers, stouts, Pale Ales...etc.  Very befitting of the season.  

The staff here is really good too.  With the amount of kids running around, it can be easy for a staff member to not handle things well, but whenever there was an issue, they were able to cal my and professionally handle it.  Kudos!!  

We were here for a private party and had several appetizers and a Taco Bar for dinner.  The food was pretty good, standard bar room fare, but that was fine with me!  As the food trays kept emptying, the staff was there refiling it with the next round.  No waiting around for more food.  

The bowling lanes themselves are extremely clean and in great shape.  Big screen TV's are above the pins so that you don't miss out on your favorite game while bowling.  

I have not been to a bowling alley in such a long time, but I really enjoyed my time here and would absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"I had a very good experience here, all the staff was very helpful and cheerful! Can get busy at times but the staff handles it very well."}
{"text":"I am not a bowler, well not a good one anyway.  My business though loves to throw bowling nights and we frequent this place a few times a year.  
They have two party lanes at the end and serve pretty decent food..I like the chicken skewers and mini burgers!
I definitely use this place if I was ever to plan a bowling party!  Great customer service."}
{"text":"I walked in with friends on a Friday night, which could only mean it was also... cosmic bowling night: the ultimate dance-club and bowling mash-up with matching DJ, disco balls, multicolored lane dividers and of course, bowling.

Freeway lanes is spacious, clean, and on non-cosmic nights: well-lit. Staff are friendly and useful. There is something for everyone, and I mean non-bowling activities like: the arcade section, billiards, bar area, pizza, wings and a laser-maze. They have a very family-oriented crowd and following. They also offer birthday or party packages.

We were \"bowled-over\" by this place. It has my recommendation."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we were able to find this place. This place has so much to offer we will definitely be back. There were games,tokens and tickets for the kids!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to this bowling alley and they have done a great job with upgrades and adding more ways to have fun - ninja warrior challenge (yes please!) and even more arcade style games.  The perfect spot to hang out with friends for a beer and watch Cleveland sports or get a crew together to go bowling on the weekends.  Attentive bar staff and good music for all ages."}
{"text":"we went for cosmic bowling Saturday night - $15 per person incl. shoes for 2 hours. 7-9, 9-11 or 11-1. the earlier hours tend to be for kids/families, and mid hours 9-11 they played loud pop/hip-hop/club music and at 11 were starting to play 80s hits.

need to get there a little early to put your name on the list. overall pretty fun and the right amount of time to bowl before your elbows give out. people here are pretty friendly. food is gdecent too - handcut french fries, a huge portion for just $3. also has a game room and pool tables.

there is an outdoot patio and a bar - sometimes they are very strict about carding/id's and sometimes not - for instance if you have an out of state id you may need to wait for the cops to make their rounds (to check your id) before you can purchase alcohol.

a fun time, and a short walk from mitchell's ice cream make this a place we'll definitely come back to. check out their sunday and mid week price specials as well."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot about my last experience here and repeated the visit. I think she's the manager, maybe an owner, but the woman who runs the front counter is not friendly whatsoever. I took some kids here today because the alleys we like going to were all closed and the prices were outrageous. Other places have early specials, making it affordable for families. Not this place. I spent $36 for shoes and just one game for 5 kids. That may seem like a deal to you but when you can spend $25 or less for the same number of kids somewhere else, this just won't cut it."}
{"text":"We love Roll House. Its conveniently located close to work and has everything anyone needs to have a good time. Food, alcohol, games, bowling and more. The managing staff frequently walks around to make sure everyone is having a good time. Pricing on food and drinks is very reasonable. This is a hidden gem in Solon that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"It's a typical bowling alley except they've got all weights of bowling balls (big PLUS!)! 

I've been to 3 bowling alley in Cleveland (Corner Alley, Wickliffe Lanes, and Freeway Lanes). In terms of classiness, Freeway Lanes is on the same level as Wickliffe Lanes, meaning it's not a very high end bowling alley (like Corner Alley). But, it's a decent size bowling and best of all, they have bowling balls that are only 4lbs! For someone we usually think a 7lb ball is too heavy but have a hard time finding lighter balls, I'm definitely psyched that Freeway Lanes had them!"}
{"text":"The people that work here have bad attitudes and aren't very friendly. I went with my girlfriend and they recommended a large pizza ($15.10) which we purchased and it came with 10 pieces! No way we could finish it we ate 4 total. Complete scam. However the arcade earned it the second AND third star because it was clean unlike most and had a plethora of fun, functioning games and prizes that you'll lose/break after a day (although there are some cool ones like drones and headphones) we didn't get a chance to do lazer tag or ninja warrior but it looked fun. Overall a mediocre experience. Would've been better with kinder employees"}
{"text":"Love the bumpers being automated, and configurable to specific players . Makes bowling with kids that much more enjoyable.clean environment that seems recently renovated.Small game room to distract children as well. Was $30 for the 4 of us including shoes. Will look for a coupon next time."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half to get a lane. They kept telling us they were full even though there were six lanes obviously open. Also apparently they have a no outside food and beverage policy because they took my Mitchell's Ice Cream away. They claimed there's a sign out front, but I never saw any and again we had an hour to find it. The manager was rude about the beverages, my ice cream was 3/4th full, didn't even ask me if I wanted to finish it outside and threw it away, like what the heck? Also we came as a group of 7 and made each of us pay $17 (three root beer floats at Mitchell's). Freaking overpriced. Here's my advice, just take that money and go next door to Burger Fresh and Mitchell's for some burger and ice cream."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years.  Showed up at 6 pm for cosmic bowling. They Wanted to charge a cover charge for our family members not bowling even though the website says no cover until 8 pm.   Was supposed to get 3 hours of bowling.  They gave us two hoping we wouldn't notice.  Freeway Lanes Took a pleasant family evening and turned it into a bad experience.  Will take my business elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Now called rollhouse.  Massive upgrades.  Lots of different things to do including a ninja warrior course.   Big negative is the ticket counter.   Like most places games are almost all ticket games.  Been standing for 20 minutes waiting because one person is trying to serve more than 20 kids."}
{"text":"This place deserves negative stars. 
RACISM AT SOLON BOWLING ALLEY
Earlier this evening, my mom and nieces were bowling at Solon Bowling Alley(Rollhouse Entertainment). The white gentlemen next to them posted the word Nigger as a player name. When my mom asked them to change it, they rewrote Cunt. My young nieces were humiliated as the only black family in the establishment. I am utterly disgusted that this type of racism and sexism is still alive."}
{"text":"Got to the lanes right before the crowd came in Thanksgiving Friday at 12:30 pm. The room is large, very nice, fun. The sounds of the hitting pins get you in a bowling mood.  Tables behind the lanes allow you to eat and drink. (The pizza is good.)  For the non-bowlers there is a lot to do. An arcade and a sit-down restaurant is in the back, away from the noise. A private room is available, too. Call or go online to check out cosmic and other fun nights."}
{"text":"This is a not so hidden gem in Solon. It is always crowded not only with bowlers but for people who want to go out and hang out and get good wings and great street tacos. Laser Tag is always fun too."}
{"text":"Bored on a Friday night? How about some bowling and beer? That is what we did the other day and had a blast at Freeway Lanes. I remember going to Freeway Lanes when I was younger, and it was as fin then as it is now. Standard bowling alley but really nice. The lanes are plentiful, clean, and well maintained.  I always conjure up images of seedy bowling alleys when anyone mentions the sport--but not here. It is always nice and the staff is helpful and attentive. When we went, we had a very large party and needed three lanes. Luckily, and in spite of it being so crowded, we got them all together. We had some great pizza and fries -not the best dietary choices--and some cold beer. It was so fun! By the time we left the place had filled up and it was similar to a big bowling party with every lane occupied and people hanging out together. Definitely my definition of a great time."}
{"text":"I had an excellent time at Rollhouse Solon!!! My kids had a great time in the arcade and bowling. The girl at the rewards counter was an absolute sweetheart and helped us out, I believe her name was Abigail?  It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
