{"text":"Carrefour drastically changed their food court a few years ago and most of favorite spots are now long gone. I've been trying for the last while to find decent options in what is now at best a mediocre food court and I believe I found it in the form of Rock'n'Deli. Which for starters has a pretty cool sounding name.  I ordered their smoke meat platter and fries... and as far as food court goes, it's a solid choice. I opted for the Swiss cheese and smoked meat was lean and tasty. The sandwich can certainly be bigger for the price, which isn't exactly cheap but it's what you get in Laval's... if not the entire region of Montreal BEST shopping center. The fries were equally as good as well.  All in all, a solid place to grab grub while you rest between shopping spurts or satisfy your hunger."}
