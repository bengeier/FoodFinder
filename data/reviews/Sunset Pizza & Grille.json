{"text":"Just stopped on our way through Pittsburgh for a pizza to go.   Ordered an extra large and within 10 minutes, were out the door with our pizza!  Very efficient.  Warm, and friendly environment, small clean dining area.  Friendly employees.  Excellent pizza!!"}
{"text":"Love love love their Bbq chicken pizza! Was so disappointed when I went last week and they were closed for vacation. Now I know to double check in the summer time! Was just there a few weeks ago, not sure if I missed the sign or if it wasn't up. I'll be there this week now that they're back! Went to a place down the street and the wait was much longer for pick up and the pizza was only meh. Haven't tried anything but Bbq chicken, but I imagine all of their gourmet pizzas are delicious! Owner is very nice. Not air conditioned, but they have fans and have a few seats outside. Small eating area, don't think I would eat in, especially in the summer."}
{"text":"If Sunset Pizza only offered THE \"Sunset Pizza\" I could die a happy camper! Store owned and operated by a Turkish family that offer pizza, sub's, calzones, hoagies, gyros, wings, pasta, salads, and soups. As well as many different Turkish Specialties. Like Ka-bob dinners, Ciz-biz kofte, cigarette borek (my fave), humus, stuffed grape leaves, and a pizza boat called Pide. Have always used their delivery service (with an $8 min), however they do offer pickup and have a small eat in area (byob). Thank you Sunset Pizza for being in Carnegie!! (Not 5 stars, only because very small eat in area)"}
{"text":"Seems to be a little pricy for a small place, yet they do have delicious pizzas, gyro, shish kabob, and buffalo fries. Never tried their sandwiches but would like to one day."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza (and breadsticks) I have had in the longest time. The homemade dough is fabulous! It really does not get better and the prices are great. The family/people who run it are so sweet and friendly! Hope they are here for many years to come."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is amazing here.  Place doesn't look the best, but the food is great. Some of the best food is from places that look like a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"When I order pizza I'm always going to order from sunset. Great pizza and great family owned business. Always prompt and polite. I never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I have lived in Carnegie for over 10 years. Sunset is my choice for pizza, gyros, calzones, etc.  The service is always friendly, courteous and super fast. Who else delivers pizza from a stylish MoPed in the Summer."}
{"text":"Gotta try the kabobs they are fantastic. Pizza is great as well. People are great. Friendly. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Really great specials, especially the kabobs and Turkish meatballs. The cacik is also delicious every time and goes great on top of everything, in my opinion. The service is fantastic. Delivery always arrives faster than expected and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a really delicious Italian calzone from Sunset this weekend.  It had a generous portion of meats and cheeses with just the right amount of sauce.  The dough was very tasty, not soggy.  I cut it into thirds and was able to (carefully) eat the outer thirds by hand.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Carnegie hands dahn. Friendly Turkish people. They treat you like family. Order is always fresh and fast."}
{"text":"I mainly order the kebabs when I come here.  A little pricey but they are quite good.  If they had an option for more meat and less pita/rice I'd make this place my full time controlled carb eatery in Carnegie."}
{"text":"The pizza and desserts are amazing here! My friend gets the beef kabobs every time and loves them! The service is very friendly and inviting. I highly recommend this place for lunch:)"}
{"text":"We live nearby and are always ordering from here. We've ordered pizza, hoagies, chicken fettuccine, and the crispy chicken wrap and we're never disappointed. The delivery guys are great!"}
{"text":"My family has been long time customers of Sunset Pizza.  There are a few choices of pizza in the Carnegie area and I've had them all truly my favorite is Sunset.  Delivery & pick up is quick and service is always friendly.  They have a big menu but I stick mainly to the pizza & hoagies.  I recommend Mediterranean, we ALWAYS get that one and now I'm biased because every where I go I compare the greek pizzas to this.  Subs are also good!  Give them a try."}
{"text":"This pizza place might have the best crust ever. Light and crispy and oh so flavorful. The Buffalo wing sauce was amazing and the owners couldn't be nicer. Was a little too hot inside but for a summer day and no air conditioning easily expected. Would DEFINITELY eat here again"}
{"text":"We are moving soon, so we wanted to try out some places that would deliver to where we lived. We came across this gem, and it changed our outlook on pizza. Try this place, you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a coworker, some great lunch specials. Make sure to check out the Turkish menu, there are some gems that you don't usually see. My coworker had the Italian sub and fries, which was a lot of food for $6.99. I splurged and had the Spicy Turkish Meatballs with Rice at $8.99. Food was good and fresh, the place was clean, and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"OK, your mailer ad has a picture of a Brick Oven.  Where is it?  Called for pick up to try some brick oven pizza due to the ad...did not see a brick oven only regular pizza ovens.  Well, the pizza is thin crust and good and better then many of the local pizza shops but not brick oven.  Also, had some wings and they were average at best."}
{"text":"If you just go by looks not the best place. But this is my favorite pizza. Also, not your run of the mill buffalo wings. Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We got the garlic wings and the brocolli calzone and it was one of the best calzones I've ever had. Huge selection great food."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken kabob for take out. They give a generous amount of good quality tasty food for the price. I think they gave four chicken skewers served over flavored rice with grilled tomatoes and green pepper along with 4 pieces of naan.   The chicken is juicy, full of flavor which is not exactly spicy but it is distinct. Rice is well cooked and not bland. I will go back to this place again and I am sure I will go for the kabob again along with trying a few other items on the menu!   One more tip, I guess they make everything fresh and hence they took around 15-20 minutes to get our food. It is a good idea to order 20 minutes ahead if you are going for a take out."}
