{"text":"Great place.  It's fast, tasty, cheap, and healthy enough.

I recommend their mango salad.  Fresh, unique, and is considered a regular vegetable item for purposes of ordering."}
{"text":"Even fast food restaraunts deserve to be reviewed! 

Standard Chinese take out prices BUT for MUCH MUCH better quality! Manchu Wok is an embarrassment comparatively - I would describe the food at Wikki Hut as restaurant quality. 

Everything is ALWAYS fresh and well-seasoned, NEVER heavy, greasy or salty like the typical take out joints. 

Their veggies are cooked al dente, which I love! My favourite dish is the crispy fish - it has the perfect, light, deep fried coating and you get like 6 filets in a combo. 

Regular here and just wanted to recognize good quality food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Quick Chinese food from their steam trays. Simple options (choose x items for x$).  Tastes good and is filling."}
{"text":"I work in the financial district and I often frequent places in the PATH for lunch.

I do not like most places I eat but it is all that is there. Then I found Wikki Hut!

Wikki hut has a long line up at lunch sometimes, but it is so worth it.

I get the Ecuadorian Rice, which is rice and beans and it tastes amazing. It is like crack, I could just order the rice if possible. Carbicide :(

The Mango Salad is amazing. I get the Asado chicken but I swear it has to be pork.

Everything is very tasty here. I wont say I believe it is absolutely healthy, it borderlines soul food/comfort food. 

They pile on the food high, portions are really big - they dont skimp out.

I love Wikki Hut :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can give this anything better than 3 stars (which is A-OK, afterall) because it is food court fare.  That said, it is pretty decent.  I had a meat, veggie, starch combo - I picked Wikki Chicken, mixed vegetables, and rice with beans.  The chicken was tasty, the veggies were fresh (although mostly stir-fried broccoli), and the beans in the rice was a nice touch (they have plain rice as well for those not interested in the beans).  Combo was $6.39 + tax.

In response to Will E's comments about healthiness, yes as far as food court stuff goes, it is probably reasonably healthy if you make the right choices.  However don't be surprised if it is loaded with sodium and oil."}
{"text":"A solid choice for food court food.

I like their mango salad - a welcome change from the usual lettuce with a few strands of carrots side salad that comes with meals.

I was pretty satisfied with the spicy chicken breast (mis-leading because it's not very spicy at all) and mango salad lunch - in line with other lunch prices at $6.99. You can also get a meal of meat, rice and one vegetable for $6.99, which is probably more filling but much less healthy."}
{"text":"I love Wikki Hut at 40 King St W. It's in the food court underground, and you'll easily spot it thanks to its clean, fresh white and green branding and bright lights. 

I always avoided it because I thought it was bad food masquerading as something fresh - but I think I'm wrong. They offer the usual meat/ vege/ carb option - so I pick some rice, some unbreaded/non fried chicken (asado chicken) and broccoli and green beans. 

It's delicious. It's really really good. I can't quite figure out the nutritional value of the meat because it's marinated, and the veges are coated in oil - but they are fresh and not over cooked.

It's well worth checking out Wikki Hut because it's so quick, so tasty, and I'm going to believe, for now, it's one of the healthier options in the food court."}
