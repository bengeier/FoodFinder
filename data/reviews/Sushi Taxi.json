{"text":"After spending a few days in Saint Sauveur and the surrounding region, my wife and I wanted to look for something a bit different. We didn't have to go far. 

Right across the street from where we staying (Manoir Saint Sauveur) was this gem called Sushi Taxi. We tried for walk up seating on a Saturday night but soon found out that reservations are a must if you want to get in at a good hour. Not to be deterred, we made reservations for Sunday night and found the restaurant equally as busy with lines of people streaming out of the restaurant waiting for take out while the inside bustled with patrons and staff.

The restaurant was quite cozy and well decorated with few tables seating around a total of 32 people.  The staff were incredible friendly and service fast.  The menu was diverse with very creative and non-traditional pairings of flavours going into their sushi concoctions. We opted for the Yin-Yang chef's plate for two which provided enough of a meal for both my wife and I.

A very satisfying experience and we would return in the future!"}
{"text":"Tout restaurant qui se respecte devrait fermer le jour de la st-valentin. Vous n'avez que confirmer mon opinion : ce qui est d'habitude un bon resto, ne vaut rien à la st-valentin. 

Payer 70$ pour le menu shogun à emporter pour 2 personnes... le riz était sec, les ingrédients manquaient de fraîcheur.... Le poisson sur les nigiris était sec, juste à l'il on pouvait le constater... 

J'ai commandé le mardi pour ne pas rater ma chance, mais ça ne voulait pas dire que je voulais que vous l'a prépariez 5 jours à l'avance!!! 

Vous êtes les experts et vous m'avez quand même vendu des sushis qui n'étaient pas frais du jour??  

J'avais hâte de goûter vos sushis vu les bonnes critiques sur Internet... C'était la 1re et la dernière fois."}
{"text":"Checked out this place while on travel for work. I'm by myself and this seemed to have a very nice outside patio. I could see there were several small two person tables available as I walked in, so was looking forward to some great sushi and nice ambiance. Was directed to a small table inside, handed a lunch menu (it was 7pm) and then ignored for 30 minutes. While I was sitting, alone, and waiting with my lunch menu, I noticed various of the waitresses walk by and bring people water refills, food, and walk right by my table. I felt like the invisible man, finally had to go and ask the hostess if I could move outside so I could at least enjoy the outside air. Was told no (even though I could see one 2 person table outside). At this point, I was ready to leave so just walked out, went to IGA and bought grocery store sushi. Grocery store sushi, yes, that's how angry I was at this place for wasting 40 minutes of my life when I had been looking forward to going to this place all day."}
{"text":"Very busy place!  Tried two days in a row and got in the second day.  Lots of people trying to get take out also makes it look busier. So don't  be put off if you see a lineup.  

Food was more fusion sushi.  We ordered the salmon tartare on a avocado galette to start.  It was amazing and good to share.  We followed it with the Yin and Yang sushi plate to share.  No wasabi here.   Fusion was a curry sauce and a creamy soy sauce mix.   Sounds weird but it was really tasty.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"Good and unique sushi. Reasonable prices. I went on a Sunday and they had a deal, 15 pieces for 11.99$. Chefs choice of pieces. Good quality for what you pay. If you want to go on the terasse on the weekend, its good to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant.  J'ai goûté à des tartares de saumons dans pratiquement 100 restaurants différents et c'est le meilleur que j'ai goûté à vie....  

Sinon, y'a les sushis : le Bubba Gump est excellent entre autre."}
