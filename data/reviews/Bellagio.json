{"text":"Located outside of the Hotel du Lac.  The meat rolls were outstanding and the seafood risotto with local fish was also very flavorful.  Also tried chianti, tiramisu and almond cake.  Everything was so good that we ate here twice during our stay.  The lake view was so pretty to look at while having dinner.  Great location, nice staff and good food.  Definitely a winner."}
{"text":"As soon as we got off the boat, we couldn't help but be hypnotized by the delicious looking pasta at Bellagio ristorante. The restaurant is part of Hotel du Lac and we made note of it. We returned after an hour to have some lunch.

This restaurant is so good that even the pigeons want in on the action. You will most likely spend your lunch shooing away pigeons from your table. You get used to it quick. Despite the pigeons, the ambiance is still very nice and Bellagio ristorante is one of those upper class restaurants. Lunch by the lake and the service is good and pretty quick.

We got the Tagliatelle with bolognese sauce and the special fish of the day (White Como lake fish fillet in butter and sage with grilled vegetables. We also got large skinny coca colas. The food was absolutely delicious, rich, and hearty. If there is one thing Italians do well other than pasta, it's seafood."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good pasta and service. Yes, it's right at the dock but was an enjoyable meal. The signage is not great but it is the bar-restaurant attached to the hotel. Inside and outside seating. Really good bread. Doesn't take AMEX but cash, Visa and MC."}
{"text":"Amazing food to go with amazing view. Had the tempura fried zucchini flower, seafood linguine and mango sticky rice (in Italy?!?!? Are you kidding me in a good way). The clams were uber fresh and the pasta had a great kick to it while the mango sticky rice was amazing. The ristorante is different from your every Italian ristorante in all of Italy as they have a fusion flavor to it as evidenced by the tempura and mango sticky rice.  The must in Bellagio!"}
{"text":"This is where it all began when Steve Wynn visited the lake town of Bellagio on Lake Como. It had inspired him to build and create a small Italian lake town with a creative touch. 

I honestly thought the Bellagio was just right beside the town on Lake Como but we really had to take a 2 hour ride from the main port to get to Bellagio. It was worth it viewing the small towns and looking at all the millionaire homes on the hills. I know George Clooney and other celebrities have a house along the lake. If only I had that type of money but I'd rather just visit than live here. 

Just like the rest of Italy, you'll find lots of small shops and restaurants around the hilly town. The locals are very friendly and welcoming to tourists like myself."}
{"text":"The view in Bellagio Lake Como is to die for! My friends and I drove from outside Milan to Lake Como for a day trip. The roadway leading up to Lake Comp is pretty tight, but Europeans seem to be good drivers. We stopped along the way to take in all that beauty!! Photos do it no justice. Simply magnificent is all I have to say! Once there, the gelato, food, wine, EVERYTHING was delightful. I couldn't get enough of it all. Remember to bring a sweater or light jacket. Once the sun goes down, it tends to be cool by the water!"}
