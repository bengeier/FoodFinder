{"text":"I would like to give them a 0. There is essentially no services. After sitting down, there is no waiter for 10 min. It takes them more than half hour to bring us water. The waitress is also very rude.   The food is average."}
{"text":"Best Burger I had in long time. I had the black bean and my date had the korean burger.  Fries are interesting too, great decor and clean inside.  I ate at the Palazzo/Venetian location in Vegas."}
{"text":"A decent burger place. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this place, but we were at the Venetian and we were starving. My burger was pretty good. Tater tots were OK. Waitress seemed bored to death. Go to Le Burger Brassierre between Paris & Bally's instead."}
{"text":"I work in Town Square.  I Love Burgers is an attractive option for my co-workers and I because of a hefty 40% discount.  That being said, I can understand some of the negative opinions of this place because it would be too expensive to eat here with any kind of regularity.  What I like about this place is the variety of burgers and you get a generous sized patty.  Unlike most fast food burger places, I feel full eating a burger without having to get fries.  My favorite burger at this place is the BBQ Burger - bacon, onion straws, american cheese, and bbq sauce.  On the downside, I don't like the butter-brushed bun, but it's a minor quibble.  The milkshakes they offer are excellent.  The blueberry panshake is my current favorite.  Overall, the food is good, but unless you work in Town Square, you're probably better off just going to Five Guys or In-N-Out."}
{"text":"The I love Bacon burger is one of the best bugers I've ever had and not only do I love burgers, but I am picky. I liked this place so much I kept thinking about it every time I ate a burger in Vegas. I actually ended up going back a second time before I left."}
{"text":"So I showed up at 7:45pm tonight. Place looked closed from the outside but they are open until 10pm. Must say my food was great and have no complaints. However they seemed to be closing the place up by 8:15pm. They closed up the soda machine so you couldn't get refills. Then when I went up to grab a shake I was told that they had cleaned up the machine already. Wow!  Confused they are open for another hour and 40 minutes. Not very buisness friendly no wonder they were empty. Probably won't go back due to service."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times in 3 days the Wagyu burger is incredible, the Loco Moco is amazing, and I am eating breakfast here as I write this right now, I Love Burgers, the Wagyu breakfast is by far my favorite dish from here. The dressing, the eggs, the hash browns, and all of its ingredients add texture, flavor and mixture of oh wow and Oliver Twist style \"I want some more.\" Trust me though it's not from lack of portion size, just the need to continue into the next dish so you can find the next dish place in your rankings. Servers are great, Angie, my breakfast waitress is awesome, and the managers are friendly. When you walk in say Hi to mark, Nick, Dawn or Ed and they'll smile and wave before you lose reality to the beef."}
{"text":"i've been here a few times and my family and I absolutely love it! the staff is really funny and nice! and the food is great!! whenever we're in vegas, this is our go-to place! i definitely recommend it! :)"}
{"text":"Best kept breakfast secret in Vegas. Hard to find on the 2nd floor of Palazzo in the retail shopping area. Very friendly. Food was great and not expensive for this area."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting , I haven't eaten anywhere so terrible in a long time.  Sadly the burger was the worst part of the meal.  It not only looked disgusting but tasted that way too."}
{"text":"This place is nothing more than a ripoff.   2 burgers 2 32 dos equis 1 french fry  =$90?????????  Crappy overly bright ambience,mediocre food....wow. Just wow. I guess only in Vegas can a restaurant get away with this."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but place is disorganized. 2 of 5 orders were wrong and sides never arrived."}
{"text":"Not a fan! food was overpriced and mediocre at best! IMO go to HOLSTEIN's if you want a good burger! this was eeeehhh , even if they give you a free mac n cheese fried balls for checking in, still wouldnt go back!"}
{"text":"This place stomps on bachi. Don't know how the heck that place has such good reviews... I Love Burgers is consistent. No, the service is not amazing (bachi is downright traumatizing), but the burgers come out as-ordered, every time. The truffle fries actually taste like they have truffle oil on them and don't cost you an arm and a leg. Very kid friendly environment with a whole room's worth of a chalkboard. Kind of gross and messy, but my boys really do love it. Also- outdoor seating. Always a plus. Not to mention they're on the side of Town Square that actually has parking available, another plus. The Heart & Seoul is frickin delicious. As is the Oregon Trail (being from Oregon, I can professionally judge that one). The menu is simple and to the point, no need for all the bullhonkey. Good food, great prices, pretty convenient (especially for being so close to the strip), and consistency. This location, I should say, is far superior to the one in Palazzo. I don't care for that one..."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good but the food quality in both the burgers and fries are now disappointing. I don't know what they changed but nothing tastes the way it did before."}
{"text":"Terrible. Small tasteless overcooked burgers. I can't believe they are still in business."}
{"text":"Give it 2 star for the service and looks of the inside. Ordered burger & chicken finger. Find the burger to taste below average couldn't even eat the chicken finger. Recommend this place when drunk. You will enjoy in and out burger more. Wast of money. Dissatisfied"}
{"text":"The worse burgers I have ever had. I ordered a hamburger with everything on it except I asked for no onions because I am allergic to them. They brought it with the onions. Then I waited for 10 minutes for the waitress to come to my table...but she never did. Finally asked another waitress to help. She took the 1st order back and brought me another one without the onions. No flavor what so ever. Well, the original waitress never came back. I did not take another bite of the hamburger. They never apologized and they still charged my husband and I an arm and a leg. Waitress are very rude. Will never eat there again, thats for sure. I rather eat a burger at in and out or burger king....much better flavor and less expensive."}
{"text":"WARNING! KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS AND CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS. I got charged 86 dollars when I only signed for 17. I called and the manager was able to fix it for me. But something like this should not have happened in the first place."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from friends. It was time we try it out. I got the I heart bacon burger and truffle fries. It's so good! They also give %50 off one meal everyday for Military. My daughter loves to draw on the chalk board walls. This is going to be a regular for us."}
{"text":"The overall design of the place is good and the food was not terrible. That's about all the good things I could say. The burger was super greasy and overcooked. There was no option for how how I wanted it cooked, so I guess that's how everyone's burger must be. My boyfriend and I both got an I love bacon burger and the burger was lacking in bacon. We shared truffle fries... Which should not be a dollar extra because you can barely taste the truffle in the fries.   Overall, it's overpriced for what you really get... They seem to spend more money decorating the place in cool chairs, paint, and televisions than they did on developing a good burger."}
{"text":"I've been before and the food is okay. Today however I'm reviewing the service. After seating at the bar patiently waiting for service I decided to leave after the bartender did not acknowledge my presence and went on to serve guest that arrived after me. The host at the door were no better and very unpleasant."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I had the black bean burger and it was spotted on. Staff was very friendly and menu had just the right amount of items."}
{"text":"Finally made it in here after thinking about it for a long time.  I first noticed that most of the burgers are priced about the same.  This makes it a lot easier to order a burger with more \"stuff\" on it without having to worry about paying more for it.    I had the BBQ Bacon burger.  It was okay, didn't seem to taste like much.  More BBQ sauce would have done it for me.  Fries were good, although the tots were better.  We came on a Tuesday so to the Buy One Get One Free burger deal was a nice surprise.  I'll come in again if I'm at Town Square and hungry but probably won't make a destination out of it."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to a restaurant and remembered having a great experience, only to return and find yourself very disappointed? Such is the case with my most recent visit to I Love Burgers. I first went about a year ago before I had started the blog and have been meaning to go back and give a proper review based on that impression. Sadly now I wish I hadn't returned because my view has been tainted.  I Love Burgers is located in the shops inside the Palazzo in the heart of tourist territory. While the space is a bit too open and sparse, it's kind of a fun, bubbly attempt at something modern and different. The one major complaint I would have is that the lighting is totally inconsistent and awful. But I'm sure 99% of the people that go in there don't even give this a thought so we can move on.  Their menu has everything from appetizers, to shakes, salads, and of course burgers. In addition to some Angus offerings, they also have ground buffalo, turkey and chicken burgers. I had the fried mac and cheese bites on my first visit and wasn't that happy with them, so chose to skip any apps this time. My lunch partner ordered the fried pickles and I guess they were ok although I probably wouldn't order them again. I usually don't mess around with any strange offerings on my initial review visits as I'm trying to focus solely on the burger.  As for the burger, this second visit was very disappointing. There was one word I wanted to repeat over and over again: DRY. I'm sad to say that this was the first time I've ever taken apart a burger for one of my reviews and actually add a decent helping of ketchup. The meat was dry, the bun was dry, and it needed help. The meat had ok flavor, but it was just too dry and overcooked to be good. The lettuce was a bit weak, the tomato didn't help, and my cheese was melted but not really present. I don't really remember many of the specifics of my first visit, but I do remember being happy enough to make a mental note for a full return and official review. I'm not sure if I just caught them on a bad day or if things have changed and are not as good as before.  One thing I'm sure that changed were the fries. On my first visit I had shoestring fries which I remember being far too thin and not quite substantial enough to hold any good flavor throughout my meal. On this visit I was given normal fries, but found them to be very soggy and had a bad oily taste. Maybe a place that is called I Love Burgers isn't as concerned with their fries, if I wanted amazing fries I should go to I Love Fries?  I do want to make a special note in this review and mention the representatives of this restaurant chain. While I was there for lunch I tweeted my location and got a response from them the next day asking how my meal was. After a small conversation back and forth explaining my disappointment, they were very apologetic and mentioned that after supposedly selling over 150,000 burgers this year they're bound to mess up occasionally. I can definitely accept this explanation, and wouldn't write them off for good, but still have to take points off for inconsistency between my two visits, and also take into consideration that my friend was equally as disappointed with his meal. Maybe I'll try their Town Square location next time for something a little different.  Based on all that, what can I say? A $10 dry burger, combined with $5 of disappointing fries makes this for a pricey meal that I wasn't happy with. I guess you can take the strip location into account for the price, but I have a hard time paying $5 for fries almost anywhere. At this point I'm really not sure if I can recommend going here, sorry to say. Maybe next time I'm down at Town Square I'll venture into that location and hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My boyfriend and I were astonished by the flat out rude waitress we had here. We were seated right away, but we waited about ten minutes before anyone even came to our table. It was amazing to us because the restaurant wasn't crowded at all and there were many waiters/waitresses just standing around. When the waitress finally came to our table to take our order, she interrupted my boyfriend mid sentence when he was ordering  to have a conversation with another waitress who was walking by. Naturally, my boyfriend and I were a bit annoyed that she thought her conversation with this other waitress was more important than hearing the rest of our order. when she  finished her conversation she looked at us annoyed and said \"uhh is there something you'd like to say to me? \" as if she was bothered by us wanting her to pay attention long enough to take our order! I couldn't believe her rude attitude toward us, and we were not about to pay money to be treated so poorly so we walked out and told the hostess to cancel our order. Hands down worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Good eats and good service! Big, juicy burgers and tasty fries."}
{"text":"I went to Vegas for the first time in my life and after a night of drinking I wanted a delicious breakfast. By chance I walked by this place and the manager mark saw me and told me to give it a try and I wouldn't be sorry.... And boy was he right. The bartender was awesome, gave great advice and I got the delicious breakfast sliders. The meal hit the spot, the staff was great and it was nice to give my $$$ to the little guy at the hotel. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Palazzo has lots of very expensive restaurants promoted by brand-name chefs (Wolfgang Puck, Emeril Lagasse, Mario Battali) but sometimes you want a less expensive, more casual, and easier alternative. My colleagues think the hamburgers here are great. I never tried them, but I tried the Kale Salad and the Mediterranean Salad and both were great. Also, the parmesan fries were delicious but share the order, it's large!"}
{"text":"I had the I 'heart' bacon burger. SO GOOD!!! My husband tried it and said it felt like he had gone blind and regained his sight, it was so good. The meat on my burger was smoked to perfection.   He ordered the caprese burger. Although he liked my burger better, he said they were both great.   I got regular fries, he got truffle. I wish the truffle fries had a garnish on top of some sort. The taste was great, though.   We also shared a strawberry milkshake. It was good, but I think I'll try something else next time.   The service was amazing. The employees were nice, helpful (with our baby), and informative when we asked about the menu. This place is a 'must-try' of you 'heart' burgers."}
{"text":"Great friendly service... But the burger was horrible!! I had one bite and had to spit it out!!! Wow... Disgusting!!! At least... The waitress was nice!! I wish there was a way I could choose zero stars!!"}
{"text":"ZERO stars.  Here's my story..... 4 nights in Vegas for the Rugby Seven's Tourney.  Decided to ease up on the nightly $200 dinner bill and go for a burger with the wife, daughter, sis/bro-in-law and their infant daughter.  We get seated after waiting 15 minutes (restaurant was not even half full).  Sit down and waitress ask for our drink orders.  I order an orange shake and a water.  water comes out in a few minutes. She takes our order.  We wait ten, twenty, thirty minutes. not one thing comes.  We would have made a huff, but our kids were there and Redfoo from LMFAO was sitting next to us, so we let it slide for the moment.  Now we watch Redfoo get his food, eat it and leave, and three tables around us get drinks and appetizers going.  Finally, flag the waitress (who clearly didn't give a rats ass about customer service) and ask what gives?  She says, \"Oh yeah, i think the ticket got stuck in the machine.  it will be out in a few minutes\".  30 minutes later, the bro-in-law leaves and our food comes out.  The guy who brings out the food yells across the room to the hostess up front.  \"IS THIS 21.  IS THIS FOR TABLE 21?\"  as he starts giving our food to another table.  We say its our food and tell him we've been waiting over an hour for our food.  He says, \"no you haven't\"  the ticket says 26 minutes.\"  Idiot.  So we get our food, they forget half of the order and my daugther's meal was left out.  We wait another 10 minutes for my daughter's food to come.  Still haven't gotten my shake.  For the first time since she took our order, server comes buy and we tell her, we've waited over an hour for our food, our order was wrong and items were forgotten.  She responds, \"I guess the teamwork isn't working today.\" whatt????  Then she says, \"well you still want the shake?\"  Never an apology, or acknowledgement of our waiting so long.   After all the waiting, our food was not good at all.  Just average fair.  Would have been better to go to McD's.  Oh and I finally got that shake. After my meal was finished.    I will be sharing this with the corporate folks and the Palazzo.  It was shameful and those who run this business should know that their staff is going to ruin their business."}
{"text":"Met with some friends after a great night, had the caprese burger, which was superb. My buddy had the Dante, which he thought was great too. Service was excellent, everyone is really friendly here. Would definitely plan on coming back the next time we hit the strip."}
{"text":"Pros: not terribly expensive, coupons WIDELY available (not a great sign, frankly), never a line, nice enough service.  Cons: they go a little to hard toward comfort food, so it's all belly-bomb style.  Best thing I had was the kale salad."}
{"text":"The burgers were alright as far as flavor goes. However, they are about $15 a piece, smaller than I expected, and do not even come with fries.  Our waitress was very slow. Water glasses went empty for long periods of time and I can't believe how long it took them to prepare 2 burgers and one salad.  Also, if you are in the Venetian during Passaporto di Carnivale season, don't try to use the coupon deals for this place. There are quite a few hidden restrictions as far as what you are allowed to get discounts on."}
{"text":"Employees were friendly and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. Nice atmosphere and interesting menu.   Only complaint is that nobody knows how to clean a table. As a matter of fact, nobody even tried to wipe anything down. Every table was dirty and some even had dried condiments so stuck on that we couldn't even wipe it off on our own. We watched everybody follow in our footsteps and go table to table trying to find a cleaner one (without luck of course)."}
{"text":"I like their daring, different types of specialty meats and cheeses...THIS IS NO STEAK N SHAKE!  That being said their pricing could use a little work.  The fare did not justify a $30/burger bill, however, location, location location!  It may have something to do with the fact that it's located in the heart of the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Service good, food not so much. Fried Mac n cheese not cheesy, garbage fries not good and burgers were eh. We thought the Caramel Corn shake was weird. It had pieces of mashed up corn, caramel syrup topped with caramel dipped popcorn."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by I love burgers, at first I thought the menu was a little pricey for a burger until I saw the daily specials and happy hour. I went on the Thursday for lunch and the special of the day was a free combo upgrade so basically I just paid for my burger and got the fries and drink free, major points already!  When my burger came I thought, that's it?! But looks are deceiving because it was a big burger and it tastes pretty awesome. The fries were pretty standard showstrings but decent nonetheless. The service was friendly and I love the indoor/outdoor seating. I will definitely be back for lunch or happy hour!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, so when we saw a meet up group was scheduled to try this place out, we decided to sign up. I haven't found my perfect burger joint in Las Vegas yet, and I was hoping this would be it.   Not so much.   The restaurant itself has a good atmosphere.  Chalk boards on the wall that you can leave messages on give it a nice cozy touch.  There is a bar area that you can get alcohol at if you wish, however, the rest of the restaurant is a very family oriented environment.  A walk up counter where you place your order gives the restaurant an additional casual feel.   Unfortunately, the hamburgers themselves are just not that good.  To begin with, the menu only offers about 6 different burger options.  The woman across the table from me had ordered the \"caprese\" burger, which was supposed to be a twist on a caprese salad.  Which is actually a cool idea.  A generous slice of mozzarella was atop her burger, but the one tomato slice looked sad and carelessly plopped on there, and the few limp slices of basil looked limp.  My boyfriend ordered the barbecue burger, which caramelized onions in place of straw onions.  In a weird twist, the \"homemade\" barbecue sauce is actually a cross between ketchup and barbecue, and the restaurant has neither, plain ketchup, or plain barbecue.  A conservative dollop was on top of his burger, along with soggy onions that appeared to have been swimming in grease, and sitting on a fryer for an extended period of time. (Note that the menu does have options besides classic hamburgers such as veggie burgers and a salmon burger- which I didn't try and can't comment on. However, if you are a burger place and can't make a good hamburger, I just don't trust you to make experimental substitutes).   I will say that the \"I love bacon\" burger I ordered- a combination of ground bacon, and brisket, topped with bacon and \"bacon mayo\" was pretty good, and the most impressive of the burgers I saw.  It was maybe a bit dry, but then again, that is what happens when you make a hamburger out of brisket.  Finally, our order of sweet potato fries were somewhat bland, a little overdone, and nothing to really get excited over.  The Parmesan garlic fries that our dining companions ordered were alright to munch on while we waited for our food, but again, nothing I would miss if I never had again.   Overall, it was an OK experience, but given the many restaurants in the area, I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a huge feast when we came here. We weren't even hungry at all, but it was the only time we were able to eat dinner. The entire table of 6 ordered  the dante, I heart bacon, standard, and bbq burger. The waitress messed up on our order for the bbq burger, it was suppose to be the wagyu kobe burger. I didn't realize it until I took the bite out of the bbq burger. I guess wagyu and bbq does sound similar. We let that pass though. We ordered tons of fries too... parmesan garlic, sweet potato, garbage, and poutine. I don't know what we were thinking.  I tried all of the different burgers and fries and here are my recommendations. The I heart bacon burger and poutine fries. The bacon burger was the juiciest and tastiest burger out of all ones we ordered. It was just how I would prepare the burger myself. I don't really like blue cheese, so that is why I did not really like the dante burger. Why poutine fries? It got mushrooms in it. That's all.  This restaurant has an interesting menu. Different from other burger places I have been to. They have spiked milkshakes too! No one in our table were very adventurous at the time and did not want to try it. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food was cold and not  good at all . I will not return nor recommend it."}
{"text":"Service took forever, food took forever, even though the place was empty. Found a hair in my burger that didn't belong to me and the girl working at the counter didn't care."}
{"text":"this is a good burger joint, it did the job.  I feel that fries should be included in the price of the burger as it's just potatoes and that isn't that expensive to make and at a cost of $7 is just not justified in my books.   I had the Dante burger (blue cheese and onions).  it was flavorful and tender but the cost was $14 and fries would have been an additional $7.00 so didnt' get them.    I Love Burgers - its time to cough up fries with your burgers at no additional charge.  I also had the strawberry milkshake it was very very good, however again it was a bit high for the amount you get.  (a small slender glass with a 1/4 leftover in the milkshake shaker).   So if you got the burger, fries and milkshake it would be over $30.00 too high......"}
{"text":"Three letters - Wow! My girl and I came to Town Square to go another patio restaurant on Sunday and decided to give \"I Love Burgers\" a try even though we are vegans!  We both had salads and drinks.  The service was out of site and the food was very filling and the ingredients were fresh.  It is a great value for your money. We were greeted at the front door, had a great fun experience at the bar with Marie and the staff was extremely responsive.  The separate full bar with ESPN sealed the deal.  We met Don the manager and he spent time with us explaining all of the specials and the \"Rave Theatre Dinner & Movie\" deal available on Sundays.  We even heard that kids eat free on Sundays and have their own \"chalk room\"!  As long time Las Vegas residents we have a new favorite year round patio restaurant spot.  This is \"Johnny Rockets\" meets \"Yard House\" and \"Brio\" and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive, with lack of flavor. I tried the bacon burger and the bison as well and was disappointed with the size of portion as well as the overall blandness of my meal. The truffle fries are a plus tho. I would not go back"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. Barely any communication, horrendous people skills. Overall a bad experience that was not worth the money. Leave your table messy so they can spend more time cleaning it. They deserve it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Wasn't that busy. It took forever to order out food, and it took even longer to get it. The service was so bad. Waitress forgot to bring some items and we had to keep reminding here and have us a crappy apology. Good was okay but very expensive. Overall i would not recommend this restaurant to anybody. The service was that bad!!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was good but it wasn't the best burger I've ever had.  It's a good option at Town Square, and I hope that it will stick around since it seems like it's particular location has a hard time.  (It was previously a pizza joint.)  It was pricey for what seemed like an average burger, i.e., the normal toppings/condiments.  I'm not a fan of super fried stuff (other than french fries) so the menu seemed a bit limited to me.  (My husband, on the other hand, had trouble choosing between the different burgers.)  I like that they offer beer, and I believe they have happy hour.  They also have free wi-fi  and were showing various sports games on tv's.  I'll probably go back but it's not a must try or die type of place."}
{"text":"There is a reason why the overall review is 3 stars. My burger was well done when the menu says medium. My friend's burgers were also over cooked. For the price, there are better choices around."}
{"text":"Tons of great food here for sure. They have wonderful staff, nice and friendly, while being fast and accurate. The food was really good as my burger was cooked exactly how I like it. I had a pretty good experience overall and a good meal."}
{"text":"Food was great.  The service was excellent. Very courteous when they brought our items to our table. Great for kids, have chalk walls for them to write on.  Have a kids meal."}
{"text":"I went by this hamburger place a few times and never saw a big crowd. One night, I did not feel like to wait and decided to check out this restaurant. I had a hamburger, salad and fries to go. Was I wrong to have a take-out. My hamburger was burnt, therefore, I could not get it replaced. But both fries and salad were good though. No wonder this place was never busy."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their \"Hooray Hour, All Day Everyday\" specials.  We went for lunch and sat in the bar as required for the $1 Draft Beer special only to find out when the check came that the special only covers their \"I love beer\" brand not all draft beer.  The information posted on their Facebook page as well as one the wall in the restaurant itself just says draft beer.  The only disclaimer is \"*available at the bar only\". Server also did not mention anything about which draft beer was covered under the special pricing. $4.50 was the regular price for other draft beer which seems high to me. The BBQ burger itself was flavorful but definitely on the small side compared to Five Guys or Fatburger which are the closest comparisons. The skinny fries were normal, nothing special. The weather was sunny and warm so we sat on the patio which was nice. I definitely feel ripped off and will not go back."}
{"text":"For a \"fast\" burger joint in a large Las Vegas hotel, I have to admit this was a nice surprise. Burger was perfectly pink and the brioche roll was really delicious. And the price was decent - $11 for a regular burger.  Also enjoyed a raw kale salad with crasins and pine nuts as a side. It wouldn't be for everyone but I thought it was a perfect compliment to a juicy, high-calorie burger :)  Oh, and a pretty broad selection of draft beers which is also nice for an inexpensive burger joint.  A lovely surprise."}
{"text":"Wow, shocked that this place doesn't have amazing reviews!!!! Crazy because it is really good and perfect for kids! Wednesdays kids eat free! They have a huge room with chalkboard walls so the kids can play bc eating with toddlers anywhere is hard! My favorite part is that they have GLUTEN FREE buns that are actually really good and soft! I was thrilled! I normally wouldn't eat and entire burger myself but yesterday I couldn't help it! Love this place every time we go!"}
{"text":"Burger was too rare for \"medium\". Very mediocre food. The bartender argued about it being rare. She was slow in taking my drink order"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Just go to Grand Lux for a cheaper, tastier, larger burger. Enough said.  I would equate the burgers at I heart burgers to the quality of five guys or smashburger, except I heart burgers cost like 3-4X the amount."}
{"text":"I'm sad to see that this place has such mixed, low reviews.  Firstly, the service was amazing. We had Ryan for our server, and from beginning to end she was attentive, sweet and so helpful in recommending items to us.  We stumbled on this place because we spent the afternoon shopping and really didn't want another \"upscale\" experience after the seafood and steakhouse dinner and lunch we had at the Encore. A burger was exactly what we wanted and this place hit the spot.  What we ordered:  Fried Mac & Cheese for appetizer: YUM!! It had a slight kick of spice that wasn't over bearing and paired so well with the cheesiness of Mac and cheese.  The Steak Burger: their C.A.B. is just that- genuine Angus meat. It was juicy and flavorful. I'm not a fan of cheese in my sandwiches, and quite honestly I'm glad. The bacon and carmelized onions with their Worcester aioli was so delicious. And the brioche bun was nice and soft- just a little filling.  The love & Seoul: the onions were a little overwhelming but the wasabi mayo and fried egg added a good flavor touch to this one.   Onion rings: your basic battered fare. Good, but nothing crazy to sing about.  Do yourself a favor and get a spiked shake!!! Ohmygosh... I would come back just for this shake. We got the Buzz- ice cream, bailey's vodka and kahlua... It was serious ice cream grown up heaven.   The prices are really reasonable considering its on the Vegas strip. Everything came out in a very timely manner and quite frankly we will come again."}
{"text":"My husband and i are really big fans of burgers, and we wanted to give a try to this place for lunch time. The place is really cool, well decorated and spacious. The service was below average, after our waitress got our orders we didn`t see her face again until she brought the check. She even didn`t ask if we needed anything or doing allright. I ordered Dante burger and my husband built a custom burger for himself with some Parmesan Garlic Fries on the side . My burger was okay, but it wasn`t worth that much money. My husband`s order was completely disappointing, because even though he asked for 3 toppings for his burger, they forgot to put one of those. The fries was  allright, but they were pre-cooked, cold and not so fresh. We paid $46 for a mediocre lunch, i would rather go to any other fast food restaurant for a better experience."}
{"text":"So I have lived in vegas my whole life and really think the waiters have become bland...Well Not at I LOVE BURGERS!!!!!!!!!  I had a server named krys and she was amazing! Very friendly and had such a caring attitude, she was patient with me because I'm so indecisive and was very knowledgeable! She helped me enjoy the service you should get when out dinning in vegas! Will be back because of her!"}
{"text":"I do love burgers, but not the ones here. I gave this place 1 star, because you cant't give 0 on Yelp. For $17, my friend and I shared a \"I love bacon\" burger - not a lot of bacon, burger was dry (we ordered medium cooked), didn't taste the bacon mayo (if there was any on the burger), and the burger was small (Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger is bigger and Wendy's single Baconater beats this burger hands down). And as the other reviewers have mentioned, an In-n-Out burger for $2 tops this burger. We also ordered the restaurant's housemade chips, as suggested by the waitress. They tasted as though they had been sitting out for awhile. Since this is Vegas, I'll \"bet\" this place doesn't last longer than 2 years, if that long. With all the food choices available, I would never go back here again. I would gladly pay $17 for a burger at Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay - that place never disappoints and the burgers are juicy, flavorful and cooked to order. I'm surprised that the Venetian/Palazzo would have a place like I Love Burgers that doesn't meet the culinary standards of their other casual dining establishments. I don't like writing negative reviews, but if I can save another person from wasting $17 on a burger here, the review would have done itself justice. And yes, I should have read the other reviews on this place before eating here."}
{"text":"I have visited I love Burgers twice since it has opened and it does seem to be improving.  The first time I went with a friend of mine our burgers took over 45 minutes and they both came out wrong- wrong toppings, wrong meat temperature, etc. We were so hungry by the time the food arrived that we decided not to send the burger that was way overdone back and they literally brought out a slice of cheese for my friend to add to hers. The fries were ok, not as spectacular as the menu made them seem, but not bad. The service was not good and not bad....   I came in tonight as I was craving a good burger and had a better experience but only an ok burger. The service was great, Jason was attentive, friendly and helpful. The triple truffle fries were great! My Dante burger was literally soaking in caramelized onions and gooey blue cheese... Not bad but the consistency was soggy. The wine was surprisingly good and the deep-fried twinkles and Oreos were pretty good.  I really do love a good burger so I will be back, but I do think everything is rather overpriced since it's a-la-carte and I easily spent $30 on a burger and fries each time..."}
{"text":"If you like burgers and I do...  This place is a solid choice.  It is your standard burger joint, with burgers, fries and milkshakes.  The burger had a nice soft bun and was well cooked.  The fries were ok, and the chocolate shake was good.  However it was extremely rich.  Speaking of rich, you should consider winning the lottery before going to this place.  I realize that rent is higher for the Town Square businesses, but I ordered a burger, not steak and lobster!!!  When I go to get a burger I don't expect to fill out a loan application.  You get my point.  Honestly, there are much better places for much better prices."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and our server, Tracee was so kind and enthusiastic about the food! Our Mac and cheese nom noms were really tasty. Salmon burger and Caprese burgers were great!"}
{"text":"We were desperate for food...near closing for the mall..the Town Square App failed us. Yelp saved the day and I called to direct us. Pleasantly surprised, as they had a vegan burger. Not just a frozen \"meh\" Gardenburger, no, an honest-to-God homemade style black bean burger, with excellent homemade red pepper sauce and fried onions. Nice for a burger joint, definitely VG friendly. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent burgers and fries. I think it really depends on what you order though. We got the garbage fries which are supposedly a favorite, but I thought the poutini fries were much better. The chicken tenders were pretty good, again nothing too special. My friend got the standard burger and she thought there wasn't anything special, it really was just a standard burger. Good place to go if you're looking for a convenient place to go that isn't too pricy and tastes decent. Definitely get the poutini fries though."}
{"text":"We would have walked right by this place if the manager, mark, hadn't been standing in the doorway waving to invite us in.  Not only does he have an awesome personalty, but the food is phenomenal. He works just as hard as his staff.  It's nice to see such a strong work ethic in motion.  Thanks, mark and Angie"}
{"text":"place had great food, order the burger the way u like add or subtract what you dont want.  service could be a bit better"}
{"text":"Ate here last night on our way to see the Panda! show.  The burger was excellent.  We split the LOVE & Seoul burger... it was great.  Actually super yummy!  My problem and the reason for the missing star was the PRICE... $17 and you do not get a side... well, unless you consider a quarter of a pickle a side.  We also ordered the garbage fries to accompany the burger... they were okay... I just don't think I liked the chili on them.  I am sure a chili lover would love them.  The kids meals seem to provide enough food and were priced around $7 which included a side and drink so that was pretty reasonable.  I am not sure I would spend that much for a burger again but I did enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Ordered Oregon Trail Buffalo burger & fries to go.  Requested it be cooked 'medium'.  Burger was very rare and cold.  Couldn't eat half the $18 burger.  Fries were great."}
{"text":"We had never tried this place, but passed it many times. We don't eat red meat, so we aren't that likely to go to a place mainly focused on BURGERS. However, we wanted to try something new and it looked cute from the outside view of the patio. We walked in, were greeted in a friendly way. We asked a few questions, the gal at the front desk was helpful. So, we proceeded to sit at the bar, where she said we could order food from the bar-YEAH!  Our bar server Aaron was awesome, he informed us of the cold beverage happy hour drink specials, paid close attention to the questions we asked about the alcohol content and price of certain beers. He also helped with questions about the Veggie Patty Burger and how it was cooked and what it was made with. When the food arrived, it was spot on. ThE BLACK BEAN VEGGIE BURGER WAS AWESOME-COOKED THOROUGHLY! DELISH! The toppings were fresh and tasty to! The sweet potato fries had a bit too much salt on them, but that's an easy fix. We just order no salt next time-they were delish to. The drinks were cold and the glasses were clean! I was highly impressed by this place. I will definitely go back. Great HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS 7 days a week, fun atmosphere at Town Square and GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE!  Reasonably priced to!  THanks  the address listed above is wrong be careful-It's to the left of GuitarCenter in Town Square. If you are looking at Guitar Center Front Doors, walk to the left of GC and it's got a cute awning, you can't miss it!  GREAT PLACE! !!"}
{"text":"The food was good (not for the price but it is Vegas). The service was horrible. Took literally 2 hours. We did have a large group of 14, however 3 other tables who came in well after ours was able to order eat and pay far quicker. Constantly had to wave down our waiter for basic things like refills. Waited for over 20 mins to get our bill and pay and of course with the size of our group the waiter automatically gets 18% so he was not the least bit worried about the service and it was evident.  Food was maybe 3.5 stars and service was 1 star at best."}
{"text":"This place did not impress.  We were looking for something casual and tasty and settled on this spot.  I had the Bacon/Brisket burger and my wife had another burger but both were pretty average.  They advertise 55 beers but I think that at least 50 of them are generic macro brews with a couple craft selections like Lagunitas and Stone.  We also had an order of fried pickles which came with an extra hair on them.  Interesting thing is that the pickles were sliced lengthwise and fried.  My wife had a frozen daquiri that was tasty.  The servers were helpful but there seemed to be way to many of them standing around.  Overall: Fries: Regular Pickles: Good (if not hairy) Burger: Regular"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! Burgers are very under cooked ! Not only that they don't taste that good. Fries and drink cost extra. They won't let you make and substitutions. If you pay the extra $2 for bacon you only get 1 piece! Shakes are bit that good either. After talking with the sone staff and manager, they seem untrained and just running the place with little instruction. If your the owner of the place and your reading this - listen to your customers and staff because your ideas are not working!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, a little pricy but hey it's to be expected in Vegas. Beef was high quality, the bacon was perfect and of course the bun was awesome... They even print their name on it."}
{"text":"Wish I would've checked Yelp before we went in :/  After seeing a movie with the fam we decided to try this place out. We walked in and it reminded me a bit of five guys so I was looking forward to what they had to offer. They have more of a variety than five guys, but charge you $1 ea for the toppings and let's not forget if you want a double patty they charge you the cost of another burger :/ pretty lame if you ask me.  After looking over the menu we order our food. My mom and I asked for medium rare burgers while the rest of the fam got your standard well done. After ordering our food we sat down and I noticed they were using frozen patties (strike 1), we waited about 25-30 mins for our food when it wasn't busy (strike 2), they brought mine and my moms burgers to us first, we took a bite only to find out it was over cooked and dry (strike 3). How hard us it to cook a burger medium rare people??? I do not like dry burgers :( Had I not been starving, and knew it wouldn't take ANOTHER 25mins, I would've made them cook another one, but I didn't want to chance the LOOOOONG wait...almost forgot to mention how tiny the burgers were (strike 4). Could've gone to mcdonalds, payed less for the food, fries and drinks included, and would've enjoyed that better! For the outrageous price you're paying you should get your food exactly the way you ask for it!!   The only thing nice I have to say is the service was ok, the buns were tasty, and the seasoning on the frozen not fresh burger was ok....overall, horrible experience! We should've just gone to Carls Jr or In n Out  :("}
{"text":"Portions are small for the price and burgers are not that great. Service was not good. they shouldnt leave open kitchen to see them messing around while you wait for your food and the place is empty. Many better options if your craving a good burger."}
{"text":"Over priced dry burger.   I ordered the standard with with pepper jack cheese jalapenos and an order of onion rings and a regular drink. The total came out to around 16 dollars. I thought to myself this burger better be worth it. We sat at one of the tables over looking the kitchen. I like the open kitchen feel you can see how your food is being cooked. To my surprise the onion rings came out pretty quick, hoping my burger would come out shortly. 15 min later my burger finally came out and by that time my onion rings were cold. I would have been ok if both came out at about the same time. The presentation of the burger was good and was pleased to see fresh jalapenos instead of your typical pickled peppers. Upon taking the first bite I found the burger to be very bland and very dry. I asked for a few cups of ranch to make up for the dryness of the burger. Ironically the only thing that I enjoyed was the ranch. Nice and thick and not watered down.   Overall like I said over priced dry burger. Their beer selection looked promising so I may come back for a few beers and maybe their appetizers but definitely not for their burgers.   I \"Love\" their Ranch but not their Burgers!"}
{"text":"Was just ok...for the price you pay it really wasn't worth it. The buffalo burger was over cooked, dry, and a bit flavorless. The Parmesan fries were good but the portion was really small for the price."}
{"text":"So went to this spot and I ordered Turkey Burger and Truffle fries. The fries absolutely were not truffle fries nothing about them tasted truffle, the burger was so overcooked and black. My nephew had classic burger and regular fries and gave it a 5. Oh we also had a soda, $27 for this? Are you kidding me? Seriously I'd  rather eat In and Out Burger any day. Less chatting people and focus on your food that comes out. Not even worth complaining to these children working there."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly unimpressed by this place. It is not hard to mess up a burger, but they managed to do it. The server lacked any education about the menu,and it took forever to get drinks. We never even got the orange juice we asked multiple people for to go with the bottles of champagne. When asked if medium rare was a true medium rare, the server (with arrogance) said that the chef was a professional so of course it was a true medium rare. Everyone in my group ordered a burger medium or medium rare. Needless to say, every burger came out well done. All of us were so hungry that we are them. One of my friends refused and sent it back. The server and manager came back with her new burger and watched while she cut it in half. To our surprise, it was still cooked well done. We ended up getting a lot of our meal comped, but I wouldn't go back. You can find a better burger and service in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a hard day at work. came in staff was friendly. garlic fries on point. shakes were good . only problem was the price but hey its the strip prices so expect it !!!"}
{"text":"I love burgers, so I really wanted to love I Love Burgers.  I loved the friendly hostesses.  I loved the friendly woman working at the counter.  I didn't love the over cooked, dry burger.  I didn't love the under cooked fatty bacon they slapped on my over cooked dry burger.  So five stars for the employees, but only 2 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Worst burgers in Vegas. Poor quality meat. No Gluten free buns.  False advertising on pricing. No \"real\" beer. Would never recommend."}
{"text":"We came across this place while wandering around the Palazzo shopping center.  It should have been a sign seeing this place was almost empty during Memorial Day weekend.  Although our server was extremely attentive and friendly, the food just didn't match the prices ($10-$20).    I ordered a Standard burger with a side of fried pickles.  My burger was a little dry with little flavor. The fried pickles were over-battered on some pieces and under-battered on others.  They were also very greasy!  I LOVE fried pickles, so when I was served these sub-par spears, I was disappointed.  Would I return again?  Probably if I were starving."}
{"text":"Best. Chicken. Fingers. Ever. The table had a combination of chicken fingers, hamburgers, fries and tater tots. The chicken fingers and tater tots were some of the best we've ever had. Ever!  The four star rating is because the hamburgers and fries were good but not superb. Overall...highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here today with my husband and agree with the other posts proclaiming that they definitely don't love these burgers.  If you name a restaurant \"I Love Burgers\" you've set some lofty expectations to meet!   1st:  The burger patty itself tasted as if it had been frozen.  It was indeed shaped like a hockey puck and was dense like the meat had been overworked.  Watch a cooking show for god's sake! This is patty 101.  And how about some seasoning?!  2nd:  $28.00 for 2 people and we didn't even have beers.  Kind of pricey for sub-par food.  We can get a tasty burger at In-n-Out for half the price - no frozen patty, either.  Has any one told the owners Las Vegas is a foodie town?  3rd:  My husband ordered the chicken fingers (3 cooked from frozen) for $6.00?  No fries with that?  REALLY!!!  He also ordered the nom noms.  They were crispy but not very flavorful and the accompanying \"cheese\" sauce was bland and seemed to lack cheese.  Start with tasty food before opening a restaurant!  The cute signage and locations aren't enough.  The atmosphere was just okay and the service was just okay but not memorable in any way.  This was a very disappointing meal and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! My boyfriend and I recieved a couple of $5 off coupons from the coffee bean which says that it's valid one per customer and each of us recieved one. So when we tried using them they only allowed us to use one of the coupons for our order and I showed him on the coupon it said one per customer and made the point that we were each a customer. Then the server became really rude and made a smart comment basically making us feel cheap. We're not cheap people but we weren't really planning on spending $20 on a burger! The service is absolutely terrible! It takes 20 mins just for the server just to acknowledge your existance. And when you order your food, they don't even care how you liked it cooked. I asked to get my burger with cheese but sure enough, when the food actually came 45 mins later, it didn't have cheese that I asked for or very much of anything. I didn't even want to complain at that point. I just wanted to leave and not spend another second in that place. Take my advice, there's a lot of better and even cheaper restaurants even on the strip, don't waste your time and money at this hell hole!  Oh ya, and they bring you the check way before they actually bring you your food, which I find to be very tacky! And plus how would u kno how much to tip before you're even serviced? Durrrrr!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to go try this place yesterday. We are not picky people at all because we both have worked in the food industry and know how it is. Well this place was probably the worst place I've eaten a burger at. We got seated right away, I ordered a bbq burger well done , my husband ordered the double all American burger medium well and we shared garbage fries. We told the waiter if they can bring the garbage fries with the burgers. Well they brought the fries first as the appitizer, which was not what we wanted but it was.no big deal we understand things happen. Well after our \"appitizer\" we waited for over an hour for our burgers, we had really thought they had forgotten our burgers.so this is about 1 1/2 just for two burgers and fries that we have waited for. After they brought the burgers I bite into mine, blood came running out , the burger was medium rare and I could not eat it because I am pregnant which is why I ordered mine well done. So after waiting for an 1 1/2 I had to wait an additional 20 min just to get my order. Now the second time they brought my burger it was.cooked correctly but had no bbq. I didn't send it back, just ate it bc that wasn't a big deal to me even thou I ordered a bbq burger. So it's not almost 2 hours just for burgers . They brought out check and my husband saw they had charged us a for a \"refire\" which was the burger they had to redo since THEY did it wrong in the first place. We were really pissed off at this time so we asked to speak to the manager who told us he had forgotten to take off the charge. He kindly took it off, but it was ridiculous to even see they charge us for a mistake they made.   So service sucks! It's the widest I've ever seen. The taste of the burgers are ok if you get passed the grease very grease  burger part. Burger king burger has less grease then a burger from this joint The only.good thing was the garbage fries were really good.  Overall this place sucks!! I rather had spend my money on burger king then this place.  So many people were just looking around wondering how long it is to get their burger. It took us well over 2 hours just to get served two burgers and fries. Worest experience ever. I reccommend paying a little more and eating great burgers and fries at the gorden Ramsey burger restaurant in las Vegas."}
{"text":"Located in the Palazzo (Venetian) on the second floor. Not only are their burgers great, but they serve fantastic breakfasts! We wound up going there every day for breakfast, and you get 25% off your next breakfast. A nice variety of dishes to choose from including a big breakfast burrito, omelettes, and the loco moco. The service was excellent, especially Ryan our waitress and Mark the Manager. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars would be more accurate.  Upon entering this establishment I immediately noticed the cool atmosphere, chalk board walls and not overly crowded.  The menu was simple and very inviting.  The cashier was very friendly and helpful answering questions we had about the menu.  We were not there for happy hour, but we did get our sons kids meal free (Sunday promo I think). Even after our little kiddo discount, our bill was OVER 30.00! Keep in mind this was two adults and one toddler. We paid, and found a table.  We were pretty excited, expecting a phenomenal burger.  We waited...and waited...about 25 minutes! Our food was delivered by an expediter with about as much personality as my napkin.  Clearly she was not fond of her job. Anyway, the fries were very good! the vanilla milk shake was ok, but nothing special.  Our burgers were not very big for the price paid.  They were dry and there was nothing special about them at all.  We were pretty disappointed.  my burger (spicy jalapeno burger) lacked flavor, condiments and jalapenos! I went to the counter and asked Ms. Personality for a side and she handed them over without expression.  We finished our meal and walked out with that feeling of over paying for something that was not worth it.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I will preface this with I ordered the Longhorn (chicken sandwich), which is not a burger at this burger restaurant, but it was pretty bad.  For $11, I was expected a decent chicken sandwich.  What I got was a paper thin, dry piece of chicken on a bun.  Maybe I'm just used to Chic-fil-a, but I was underwhelmed.  Also, I didn't realize it didn't come with fries, chips, or a pickle...not a big deal, but the bartender could have made sure I...who orders just a sandwich?"}
{"text":"The tater tots are the bomb and the employees are great. I'm a vegetarian, so I don't eat burgers. Everyone I eat with says they're delicious. Veggie burger is pretty good!"}
{"text":"The hotess greated us and sat us took a while for the waitress to come take our order she was to busy talking with the staff. Once she took our order we watched her again took about 5 minutes for her to enter the order into the computer another 5 for our drinks and then our order was screwed up. The waitress never checked on us and gave us the bill with the item we did not get. When we told her she seemed shocked and had the manager take it off. Service is horrible would never go back even for a free meal better burger places in vegas then this"}
{"text":"We had a great meal!!! Leon was the best!! We would definitely come back. I had the chicken parm sliders and salmon burger."}
{"text":"Did not care for this place. Limited selection of burgers without a crate your own option. Adding toppings costs $1.00 per topping. Actual burger very dry. Good shakes and fry selection, but definitely not worth the money for the value."}
{"text":"Wow this place is unbelivable bad. WORST service I have recieved at a restaurant hands down. Took over an hour to get some burgers after having to ask the waitress and manager several times about our order. Place was not even crowded.   Finally after the food arrived the burgers were messed up, Ate it anyways and after all that wait it wasnt even that good!!!!   Unreal"}
{"text":"I am very surprised that this place got three star rate. I do not like to write bad review but I simply want to warn people. If you see your burger send it back to cook more.   I stayed at Palazzo during new year, and decided to try this burger place for quick lunch. Great service, and we thought we found a good spot. My husband ordered his burger medium, but came out, it was rare. He usually never eat rare meat, but for the price that they charge we expected good quality meat, so he didn't send the dish back. Next day, he got bad diarrhea for several hours, by 2pm he was suffering with high fever and pain in stomach. I had to take him to urgent care.  Later that day, I went to talk to the restaurant manager but he didn't really helped me and just handed me corporate manager's number and email. He actually said something like, it's in Vegas during the New Years, and my husband was possibly hungover!  He was so ill, so we had to extend one more day and I drove us back 2days later. As soon as we got back, then I got sick. I had been contacting with the manager but since I paid my bill with cash and didn't keep my receipt they basically said I have no proof, and eventually they stop replying me. I didn't want to waste anymore time, so I stop contacting them.   I was not expecting anything for return.Simply I wanted them know that I was very disappointed how we were treated."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Great! Fun and retro and family oriented, yet could go dressed up.  Food: was delicious. More than enough portions.  Highlights: Fries! Sweet potato fries were awesome. With their special sauce."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before dining here.. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.. So utterly disappointing.   We shared the garbage fries. A slushy tasteless mess. And the fries over cooked and dry. And quite a small size.   Then we had the spicy burger and the Kobe beef burger which I expected to be amazing for $25. It was bland and oily and the bread was dry. Even with the truffle cheese (and I love truffle!) nope, terrible. I can't believe I spent $25 on this burger. Eat at one of the better meat restaurants."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Palazzo and needed a quick dinner before a show so we dropped by I Love Burgers. I mean, how expensive can it be? It's just burgers, right?!! OMG, I almost doubled over when I saw the bill was $65.13!!! All we got were 2 burgers, sweet potato fries, Caesar salad and 2 sodas. Really?!! The food was ok, but i just didn't think it was worth the money. I mean, I'm the kind of person that likes to enjoy a vacation. I accept that things will be overpriced, especially at the Palazzo. I never really have a budget or am stingy about stuff, I'm willing to indulge on vacation. In fact, our average dinner bill was about $80/night.........but this one really bothered me. I guess because mentally I kept thinking \"It's just burgers!!\". Well, after this dinner, my mantra was \"I hate burgers!!\" haha!  Visited July 2011"}
{"text":"Great prices and great burgers! All employees are friendly and always smiling. The general manager is always walking around, giving people their orders and thanking everyone for coming in! She is also open to any feedback you have for the restaurant.  The food is a great price and it is an open kitchen so you can see them cooking.  Get the inferno burger if you like spicy food it is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Burger in the Loco Moco dish was really good. Server & ambiance was good. Watched FIFA World Cup and had breakfast"}
{"text":"We were looking for a burger place, and we stumbles across this place called I love Burgers in the Palazzo; it ended up being a bad decision. This place was EXTREMELY expensive and the food was alright. The milkshakes were 9 dollars, but were warm and \"watery\". I ordered a medium well burger, and ended up getting a medium burger. The food just wasn't very good and I would not ever recommend or eat here again. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself was also confusing and a little weird. To be honest I guess the favorite part of my experience at this restaurant was the fries. Definitely fits the 2 star category."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here. The bartender told me the burgers are done just right with a little pink on the inside. Mine showed up charred on the outside and 100% RAW inside. At first they tried to play it off like it was supposed to be a little pink and didn't want to admit their mistake.   If you're in the mood for incredibly expensive burgers, I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolute Worst Service in Vegas!  It took 20 minutes after being seated for our waitress to even acknowledge my party and another 10 for different waitress to take our drink order.  Less than half the tables were occupied so I don't know what all the servers were doing but it wasn't serving.  Finally we get our food and for a place called \"I Love Burgers\" the burger was garbage!  It had absolutely NO FLAVOR. And to top it off I ended up paying $34 for a burger, fries and a soda.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AND WOULD NEVER VISIT AGAIN!"}
{"text":"MUST try fried pickles!!!!   My hubby who never liked pickles couldn't stop eating the fried pickles.  Kobe burger was awesome too"}
{"text":"The meal was terrible.  We came in with empty stomachs and left with full of regrets. Should have went on Yelp to check out the reviews!! I completely agree with these reviews.  Service took forever and the food tasted so bad.  Even their highly notable cheesy tots were nasty.  Stale, cold and no flavor.  Everything was flavorless.  Their burgers were not good.  We didn't even finish anything we ordered."}
{"text":"burgers were cold .....i was not impresed ...18 % gratuity for our party of six and the service was just ok ....i will never go back"}
{"text":"the 1st thing i had to find out before eating at this place was a clarification of the name of it.i asked the 2 cheerleaders, i mean hostesses if the restaurant was called I Love Burgers or I Heart Burgers.both gave me different answers, so I'll assume they are both wrong.  i went ahead and sat at the bar because i feel kinda weird sitting in a booth or table by myself.on another topic, i don't understand why more people don't sit at bars and eat.the service is usually better and quicker.bartenders are also more interesting to talk to than waitresses.anyways...  sat and the bar and took a look at the menu.started off with a strawberry milkshake while i decided what to put into my stomach.the bartender recommended the Dante.It is a ground sirloin patty topped with caramelized onions and blue cheese.thought it was a weird combination but decided to try it anyway but added the sauteed mushrooms with some of the New York style chips on the side.the bartender quickly informed me that even though it is on the Fry List, they are actually homemade potato chips.they are greasy as hell but oh, so good.the Dante was good too.  an interesting combination of flavors as the blue cheese mixes very well the sirloin, onions and the garlic.It almost overwhelms you on the 1st bite but you can't stop yourself from continuing.next time i come i wanna check out the Oregon Trail, which is basically a bison burger(another animal on my to-eat list).  another thing worth mentioning about this place is the awesome selection of booze they have.pretty much any beer you can think of is served here.if you are not worried about spending 35 bucks on a meal consisting of burgers and fries then definitely check this place out.  k, you can stop reading now."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can give this place such bad reviews, it is so chill. If you want a fast delicious burger at a decent price, and don't mind refilling your own sodas then this is the place for you.  Happy hour daily from 4-8pm in the bar. Bar was tiny but that was part of the appeal. Half off apps, \"Yes please!\" Bartender was very casual and nice. Suggested the \"Adult Root Beer Float\" cocktail in lieu of dessert... and it was delicious and $2 off.  AHI SLIDERS CRAZY GOOD. And half off. Inferno burger, get out of town. Cooked perfectly (still a little pink and juicy). Tots were eh.   My sister and I had 5 drinks, Ahi Sliders, the burger and tots and our bill was $35. What? I'm sorry maybe I'm jaded and have lived in Vegas too long but just over $22 a piece for all that in Vegas is crazy.   I also work at gourmet burger restaurant on the strip, and am a very harsh critic when it comes to good burgers.... and this place is top notch. The people that say they prefer in-n-out over ANY gourmet burger restaurant clearly have no taste."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the chili burger, sweet potato fries and the blue berry pancake milk shake! Holy cow that shake was to die for!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were passing by and the smell was amazing just from the outside. We went in and the staff was really friendly m it was very clean and they have a bar on the other side of the dining room. Outside patio area as well.   The bartender was great and the drinks were affordable and good. I had the Oregon trial burger. It's a buffalo burger. AMAZING. ... would definitely go back again when in in town."}
{"text":"I am allergic to gluten and dairy, and not only do they have Udis buns for their burgers but they took my allergies very seriously and treated me with respect. Thequality of the meat is the best I have ever had. Great meal and great price point. Bravo! I will return!"}
{"text":"Extremely low prices for town square.  The food is pretty good too.  They have great specials like 6 dollar for a burger, fries, and a beer.   They have 1 dollar draft beer too.  Even if you don't want to eat here, its a great place to pre party and get some cheap drinks."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome and it wasn't that busy when we arrived! The food was alright I got the loco moco, although it was a small portion it filled me up great, the gravy seemed store bought or frozen which is why I am giving this place a 4 star review! The service however was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers.  My wife had ceaser salad and my son. Chicken tenders and fry ...it would of been better if all of our food came out at the same time!!!"}
{"text":"We had to leave due to our waiter flirting with a girl rather than coming over to take our order. I watched him flirt for a good 5-10 minutes before we decided to leave. So while I can't comment on the food, the service was awful."}
{"text":"Leon, our waiter, and Nick, the current manager, have been awesome. The food is delicious, the service is awesome (very understanding of intoxicated people and how weird they can be). Fun environment. COME HERE."}
{"text":"For being in a casino the price is reasonable and the foid is tasty. Try their hot dog."}
{"text":"Service was good. Burgers good, not great.  They have specials , 2 for 1 on Tuesdays, etc.  The brioche bun was great, the meat is good.  The only reason I am not giving them a higher rating is because the sides are not freshly made (come in frozen),  I like that the kitchen is open and that you can watch them make the burgers from scratch.  Total cost for 2 burgers, drink & side on Tuesday was under $13.  That's a great deal."}
{"text":"The chicken burger was ok, could have used more toppings besides just tomato and lettuce. Cheese fries were awful unfortunately. Friendly staff and clean facility with low prices."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and informative.  I love the bacon burger.  I guess most people don't know but the patty is bacon and beef brisket.  All in all my experience was great."}
{"text":"This was a perfect place to be in and out in 30 minutes. We went to see the new Batman movie and before the movie wanted to eat but the place we wanted to eat at went out of business 2 days ago. The burgers were really good. Glad I didnt go to In N Out."}
{"text":"Food is like any other burger joint, nothing really special. Clean environment, decent happy hour, average prices, friendly staff. Their movie ticket/burger combo and lunch specials are a great deal though!"}
{"text":"I wish there was someway to say that this was in anyway a good place to have a burger...... but, there is no possible way. I would rather have a day old McDonald's cheese burger than eat here ever again. My wife and I found out that most restaurants do not stay open very late (by late I mean 10 pm, which for Vegas I thought was the time everything opened) on a random Tuesday night in Vegas. So unfortunately we wondered into this place.  The food was horrible, really horrible.  Don't waste your money here, I don't care how many drinks you have had, find the food court and get something there, or just find something to eat a little earlier than we did. I can still taste the grease 2 months after the fact!"}
{"text":"The Loco Moco is fantastic! I've also gotten their hangover special which was this huge burger came with tater tots. All the food is really good. And service is good too. Only subtracting a star because it's ridiculously overpriced. But that's just the way it goes in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first and last visit to this place. I will try any new burger place that opens up and went here with high hopes. With Yard House always being so crowded and Millers Ale House being so loud, I wanted a relaxing lunch.   Immediately I was off put by the staff. The girl taking orders at the counter was bored and slack jawed. The friend I was with asked for the four square checkin special. I was amazed when she said \"I don't know what that is, so I can't do it.\" When he explained and showed her his phone, she said \"Uhh yeah, I don't understand emails or huhu, so I can't do that.\" Meanwhile, right above her head is a sign asking for people to review them on Yelp! No problem!  We were hungry, so we let it go and finally ordered our food, watching the socalled staff ignore other customers in favor of their own conversation. The food runner arrived with our meals with a smile and a warm greeting, honestly the only person I encountered here with any customer service skills.  The burger was well seasoned and tasty. The butter brush applied to the bun is a little heavy, making the whole thing greasy, but the flavorful patty made up for it. Even though it was pricy, it was a solid burger.   The fries however were subpar. No seasoning, thin and flavorless. They were cooked well, very crispy, but they don't justify a purchase.   Honestly, if you're in Town Square, Yard House or Millers are better options for burgers, with better value at a comparable price. The staff is so poor here though that I don't see this place lasting long. The manager was there, watching the whole events as bored and disinterested as her employees, so I don't see anything changing. I'm not sure who the owner is, but I suspect they have no clue just how poorly the staff acts in their absence. They would be very hard pressed to get me to return."}
{"text":"Ugh. Overpriced, small burgers. We were in the mood for a good, messy, large burger and found this place while wandering around the Palazzo. The good - Funky atmosphere and the vanilla shake. The bad - SLOW service (the place was only 20% full). Very high prices for what you get. Our order was messed up. The fries were cold. These were the smallest burgers I have ever seen, not tasty. The $2 add on for onion straws was a joke. They were cold and the longest \"straw\" was maybe 1/2\" long! and just a sprinkle of them on the burger. $45 for 2 of the smallest burgers EVER, 1 vanilla shake and reluctanly a tip.  Never again."}
{"text":"Located by the West Garage in Town Square on the Boulevard.  The sweet potato fries and the nom-noms (fried mac n' cheese bites) are straight up. Nothing spectacular, but fried well.  The main event - the burger. I ordered the Inferno burger and my wife got the Oregon Trail. The beef is what makes this burger special, but it was far from special. It downright sucked. I ordered medium-rare and got well-done. My entire party of 12 got well-done burgers. The patty was under-seasoned or not seasoned at all. I guess that's how they do it over there. A Whopper is more satisfying than these burgers.  I heard the shakes are great, but I'm not coming back to try them. I recommend going to SmashBurger or Five Guys for the $5-$8 burger price range."}
{"text":"i had the standard burger. it had no real taste. it lacked seasoning. for the price on this burger, i was better off at bradley ogden's having their burger. the sweet potato fries were at least good.  the service was pretty quick and my soft drink was flat and had to ask for another one. i don't know how this place will survive with its high pricing. it was definitely not very impressive and we will not be returning here again...."}
{"text":"I just received the worst customer service from I HEART BURGER from a girl named MONICA. I orders a grilled cheese sandwich and on a separate order, I did order truffle fries. I received my fries and there was hardly any fries. Monica stated this is the same amount of fries they give to everyone.I would've believed that if I did not work for a company in town square that provides a lot of business for I heart Burger. This is the last time I will be going that and I will also tell people not to go to I heart burger. I am extremely disappointed with the lie I was told and the poor customer service from MONICA!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, food was ok very salty and everything was greasy. Nice concept needs work though. Garlic parmesan fries were good.  we had 5 in our group nobody was highly impressed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled into this place trying to find a spot to watch some Copa America and the NBA Finals without giving up an arm and leg for dinner. We got the nom noms which were very filling and tasty. The burgers were big and messy and oh so good. We also got the garlic parm fries which were a treat. A great place tucked away from the buzz of the Palazzo."}
{"text":"The best burgers in town!!! With excellent service one of my normals I get is large crispy fries with light salt!!! Also $1 beer for happy hour!!! Who does that?!?!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is obnoxiously loud and bright with the overhead lights and the blaring TVs. Burgers were good, but nothing about makes them stand out amongst all the $$$ burger joints. Service was slow."}
{"text":"This place poisoned me. They are sloppy in their kitchen and do not cook their burgers thoroughly. I was up entire night vomiting from their bacon cheeseburger. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of 8. Food was delicious! Great bacon cheese burger and good BBQ burger! Get the standard and dress it up! Spend some time with an order of onion rings and split fries with the group! Overall a fun expierience! Ambiance was good a little pricey but hey it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Kobe burger cooked medium. Got additional Bleu cheese and mushrooms. Waitress came to tell me there was no more kobe and that she could get Angus in it's place. I said that was fine. The burger came out sloppy. Did not receive my  addictional Bleu cheese. The patty was a lot smaller than what everyone else at my table had. Burger was cooked well done and was quite dry. I still had to pay the full price of the kobe meat and the missing bleu cheese."}
{"text":"I would fly to I Love Burgers just for breakfast, like right now. I am in deep love with their burger/rice/egg/gravy sauce breakfast option. Throw in your favorite hot spice - Tabasco or Cayenne pepper, and you are good to go. I've tried to replicate this dish at home and cannot do it. There's something in their gravy sauce that just can't be copied.   I haven't Googled them to see if there's another location, but as far as I know, this is the only place to get the BEST burger for breakfast. I dream of returning to this and another place (yet to be reviewed by me) that serves another divine breakfast dish. Can you tell I'm a breakfast fan? It's a problem.  Service was good both times hubby and I went, and the location (at the Pallazo) couldn't be beat."}
{"text":"Welcome to Las Vegas, a foodie's dream.  And one thing this city does well is burgers.  Not only do you have the chain restaurants (Fatburger, In-n-Out), but you've also got wonderful high-end burger joints that make you oh-so-happy to be a carnivore.  One of these delicious spots is I Love Burgers.  The original 'I Love Burgers' location is within the Shoppes at Palazzo, which I've only visited once due to the steep prices.  They've now added a new location at Town Square, and it's much more in my price range. This new location has a more \"express\" feel, which means no waiters and a self-serve ketchup counter. The atmosphere is fun and casual, with floor to ceiling chalkboard walls for the kid in you.    So do you want to know about the food?  Okay, I guess that would make sense.  This restaurant is aptly named, because you can tell that love goes into these burgers.  Each delicious item, from the fried mac-n-cheese \"nom noms\" to the juicy 7-ounce Inferno burger, is just as lip-smacking good as the Palazzo location, but the prices are cheaper. And for those who steer away from red meat, they've got chicken, veggie, and fish alternatives.  On this visit, I chose the Upstream, a grilled salmon burger on brioche bun. Great flavor, and the perfect serving size.   Overall, I give it a thumbs up.  The staff was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  The wait time was minimal.  The food was awesome.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch the week of CES.  Our waitress was super busy but this never got in the way of her professional and friendly way - our burgers and fries were fantastic.  Huge sodas, delicious bloody Mary's.  Wanted a breakfast place the next day and decided to go back.  Feels like a diner in the morning...great place for coffee, French toast, omelets, home fries and sausage and bacon...and beats the huge lines down at the Grand Lux.  Great go-to place to know about in the Grand Canal shops and prices are good.  All of the mini coffee shops at the base of the elevators tend to be packed...this is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"$50 for two burgers and an appetizer?? $20 burger that is good but not spectacular. It you're going to charge that much, throw in some fries and a pickle that doesn't look dehydrated. Service was really good and we loved our waitress. But this is a regular burger joint, nothing amazing, so definitely not worth $20 for a burger."}
{"text":"So my bf and I decided to eat here last week, I ordered the ahi sliders as and app plus I ordered the I love bacon burger, both weren't as good as I wanted it to be. The slider buns they use didn't match the flavor of the fish and ponzu sauce. The burger had no sauce on it so I didn't even want to finish my burgers. My bf ordered the jalapeno burger and he also didn't eat it all.. I'll probably try it again they might of just had a bad day"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots!! Burgers are good, juicy and flavorful. Patties are not as \"wide\" as other places (ex. In N Out), but are thicker. I also LOVE LOVE that they have tater tots here! Food is made to order, so expect a slight wait. Deducting one star because they are a bit pricey. A combo meal runs about $12 here."}
{"text":"We were excited to check out this place and disregarded sub par yelp reviews, I guess that will teach us for next time. The place looked sad on the outside and we still treked in, so dissapointing. The server took ages to get our drinks and provide us with water. She then sat others whom she helped first and they were a much larger group (we had 2 in our party today). We asked her to take our order, and she did, then a couple of minutes later she takes the large group order next to us and they got their food a long while before us. I wish we would have left, since the fries were cold and the burgers where on par with applebees. In fact applebees might be better. If you love burgers avoid this place and head to In n Out Burgers you cann get way more bang for ur buck. We paid 50 dollars for two burgers and two fries, no drinks, Palazzo needs to get rid of this joint."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the I love Seoul burger - amazing. I had mine on rice vs the bun and that was incredible.  Oreo Shake - amazing  Mac and cheese nom noms - good (although I'm biased towards any other Mac and cheese that's not Kraft).  Service was good. Food took a little while to come out but we were in no hurry!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers are outstanding but most people come for the milkshakes and with good reason you must at least share one.    I favor sweet potato fries but the oriiginal are excellent also. I would recommend you try your burger medium, ignoring your mother's advise. It is safe to do here!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were at The Venetian to view the DaVinci Exhibit, and decided to walk around the Shoppes (we live in Henderson).  After some window shopping and enjoying the exhibit, we were hungry.  She is 7 so many of the restaurants in this area are too high end so lucky us to stumble across I Love Burgers.  I do love burgers, but neither of us were in the mood, so she ordered Soup of the Day (which was delicious), and I ordered the Spicy Dog.  Both of us enjoyed the meal and our server was FANTASTIC (dang, I knew her name but it escapes me now).  Prices are not outrageous, especially for the Strip.  We will return!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I went here. I saw an ad while shopping at the mall and thought burgers would be great for lunch. I ordered the inferno( a spicy burger) with fries and a drink. Fries were good and they actually carry coke products which is hard to find in Las Vegas. My first visit I ordered the mac and cheese bites. I thought they were good but not worth ordering again. Second time around I ordered  the seared tuna sliders and was in love with them. A different burger and tater tots were just as good. Fresh burgers with good service. I will make sure to stop by whenever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The only negative to this place is the cost.  Way over priced for what you get.  However, the hamburger was very good, the fries were so-so, the chocolate and the oreo shakes were awesome."}
{"text":"OMG Best burger I've ever had! Staff are so pleasant and attentive. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Save your money.  28.00 for a salad and a burger with 15% off for military discount.  We asked for sweet potato fries and half of them were cold.  We were charged 3.00 for a small bottle of water.  Horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"For a place that proclaims to love burgers, they fail. Besides being over priced, my Dante burger was bland and boring. For a little bit there I wasn't even sure I was eating beef. No taste, no spice. Sorry, won't be visiting again. Save yourself, cross the street and go to strip burgers."}
{"text":"Pricey if you bring 7 people including yourself. Overcharge on fountain drink, paid about $14.00. But overall there Burgers are good!"}
{"text":"I love burgers too, but still...  OK, I'm not going to be Captain Bringdown here. It wasn't BAD. Service was friendly, and wait time for our table was fairly average. Not instant, but also not waiting forever. Burger selection was good. My friend chose the Standard, and I went with the Upstream Burger, which was a salmon patty. Grilled, not fried, so bonus for that.  There wasn't much atmosphere to speak of, but at least it was clean.  And the food was acceptable. Unlike my other reviews on here, I don't particularly have any superlative adjectives for I Love Burgers. It was good. That's about it. Fries were good. Atmosphere good.  There are a lot of places I can get \"good\" though, and for less. Or I could go to Holsteins, Burger Bar, or one of many other places, shell out a few more bucks and get \"great.\"  I'm not poo-poohing the place, but the only reason I can think of to really recommend it is if you're in Town Square for whatever reason, you don't want CPK, you can't afford to get Claim Jumper in your budget, and Yardhouse has a game on and you don't want to deal with the rowdies. THEN I Love Burgers might be a good choice."}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Venetian/Palazzo supercenter and need a good lunch option, head down to the mall and check this place out.  Tons of TVs, beer on tap, and a back burger that not only has bacon IN the burger, but also on top with some smoked gouda.  Granted I was drunker than Dean Martin by noon (my noon, Dean's 9AM) and starving, but this was one of the better burgers I had.  Sat with 8 other guys and they all seemed happy as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each time the quality of the food is delicious. Their fried mozzarella and mac and cheese nom noms are delicious., and I love their caesar salad. Since I don't eat burgers, I haven't had them, but I hear that they're amazing. Plus, the atmosphere is nice, and they're decently priced."}
{"text":"a decadently blended bacon burger is something most greazy-burger joint loving bums like me dream about, and this place sent me to la-la-land...  this is the description: \"A blend of ground sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda, onion strings, brioche-style bun\"   i usually live my life by the motto: \"everything is better with bacon\", but even this meal made me wonder, is this too much? most of the time i fly by the seat of my pants (thats just the kind of bacon loving guy i am)... but this time, just to be safe, i slowed down a bit and had them \"hold off\" on the \"Bacon Mayo\". the choice was not made in vain.  this thing was juicy and tasty, dripping with such flavor you could almost hear the subtle \"squeal~mooo\" with each delicious bite. its like a yummy little piggy and a juicy little cow were wrestling around inside my mouth! (try to get that image out of your brain). the crispy onion strings served perfectly complement the juicy, and the gouda not only balanced the kick of all that bacon, but brought it all together in a gooey-cheezy blanket of goodness.  such an experience, this has become a must-have stop for me with each vegas trip. just when you thought things in SIn City couldnt possibly get any more decadent, more debaucherous, or more deviant... along comes \"I Love Burgers\" and wraps it all up in Bacon!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. I got the I Love Bacon Burger. It was smaller than I anticipated, but it was tasty and filling. However, not nearly enough bacon for a burger named the I Love Bacon Burger. I also got the fried mac & cheese fries. They are definitely not fries, more like nuggets, but they were pretty fantastic. A little dry without the sauce it's served with, but with the sauce they were delightful. 1 order is enough for 2 people. All in all, not a bad burger joint."}
{"text":"Great service, relaxing environment and yummy burgers! I would definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Day trip to Vegas for work. Was at the Sands Expo Center and wanted a burger for lunch. The place is in the Palazzo. Overall, it is mixed bag. I had the Plymouth's Pride. Kind of like Thanksgiving dinner on a bun. The fries were pretty good as well, but had a ton of salt on them.  Like all places inside of the casinos, it was expensive. Also, the service was not good. We ordered and rarely saw our waitress after that.   Perhaps better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Went this past weekend and the manager was very unprofessional and not helpful at all with customers and her employees!  It took 10 minutes to take our order, the person taking the order was having some challenges with the system yet the manager did not apologize when she took over.   Instead she made an excuse that it was his third day and we had to deal with the wait.   Then it took 25 minutes to get our small order to our table and when I asked the manager why this was taking long, she yelled at me and said what is it that you want!? In front of other customers and said you want a refund is that what you want?  As my son was halfway done with his burger he spit everything that was in his mouth and said yucky! This is a 5 yr old.  I looked at his burger and it was completely raw (bloody) in the center!  I just told him not to eat anymore. As for my husband he did get some food poisoning.    We had been there couple times before and never had any issues with food or service but this past weekend was terrible that we will never go back again to this place.  I guess depends what mood the manager is in and staff that day and see if they feel like providing their customers crappy service or just okay service to get through the day.  Extremely unprofessional behavior from this manager they had this weekend running the place.  The customer is not right at this place!"}
{"text":"The burgers were nice and fresh... decent price... fries were very good (garlic parmesan)... onion rings were overpriced for 8 pieces but are good... the server Dee Dee was great and friendly... the overall experience and  atmosphere was great... The amount of Tv's is cool and they have a full bar...."}
{"text":"Gross.  Poor quality.  the burger itself was dry as dust, possibly overcooked - then covered with sickly sweet glop - tons of relish and some weird sauce.  Too much bread in the bun, and not grilled or toasted, just a cold bun right out of a bag.  Way too much salt on the fries - and I like salt.  In order to have a good burger - you have to start with a good patty - otherwise you're just covering up a bad burger with a bunch of toppings...just like you can try to cover up a bad steak with a bunch of steak sauce.  But I wouldn't eat any steak that doesn't taste good plain, and I don't want a burger that tastes bad without a ton of junk on it.  I will never go there again - there are too many other good burger choices out there."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour for the 1/2 price apps.  Note in order to benefit from happy hour you have to sit at the bar, which was fine with us.  We ordered the nom nom mac & cheese.  I found the pasta to be undercooked and came out warm.  My hubby thought it was OK.  There was nothing special about the chicken fingers.  Egg & Bacon sliders were interesting but not good enough to come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place because we were staying at the Palazzo.  For a gourmet burger joint, this place wasn't that bad.  It's a little pricey, but what do you expect in a casino in Las Vegas.  My burger came out pretty good.  I ordered the I love Bacon burger medium.  Sometimes I order it medium rare depending on the place, but since this was my 1st time trying, I had to get it medium.  So the bacon came out slightly crispy (the way I like it) but I wish they added another piece or two.  The burger was cooked a little more than I wanted it to be, but it was still good.  The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3, is because our service was really good and they have a wide variety of beer.  Jenny was our waitress and she recommended the Fried Mac & Cheese Nom Noms, which are excellent!   She was very attentive and always asked us if we needed more napkins or more drinks.  If you guys decide to come try this place, I suggest the same and order the Fried Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in Las Vegas. The staff is friendly, the food is cooked according to your order and overall a great experience. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant deserves more than 3 stars. My girlfriend and I did the groupon and saved 10 dollar on our bill.  Food was pretty good; will admit that the Strip pricing was a little hard to swallow, but the quality of service was great. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch. Food is excellent, price is great, and service is impeccable. Ben and Mark both made our experience unforgettable. Wish we had one of these on the East Coast. Will definitely return before leaving Vegas."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I are huge burger lovers, so we decieded to eat at \"I Love Burgers\" for that reason. We were disappointed. The service was horrible (We only saw her twice throughout our meal). The food, was okay. For the price we paid, i was expecting a lot more. My boyfriend was trying to remain positive about the meal, but i knew he wasn't feeling it either. I would not come back again, nor recommend it to anyone who wants a good burger."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of trying this place without first consulting Yelp.  You can do far, far better in every respect.  BLT (Mirage), Holsteins (Cosmopolitan), and Gordon Ramsay BurGR (Planet Hollywood) are just three examples that come readily to mind.    I don't mind paying upwards of $17 for a hamburger, if the food and the service are commensurate with that sort of pricing.  The food here isn't bad, but I don't think it's worth what they charge for it, and the service wasn't commensurate with the pricing either.  With the exception of the hostess, everyone seemed to try to do a good job, but didn't know how.  The word clumsy comes to mind.    The hostess wasn't very welcoming at all.  Princess, I don't need my ass kissed, but bear in mind a customer's first impression of the place comes from you.   We were seated at a tiny little table, with scarcely enough room for plates and drinks.  The furniture and decor had a cheap look, and felt very much like a fast food place.  I can't recall siting in an more uncomfortable seat than at this place.  It seemed designed to encourage you to eat and leave as quickly as possible.   Come to think of it, I wasn't able to discern any connection whatsoever between the layout and the decor of the place and what was being served.  My hunch is the previous occupant of the space was an ice cream/gelato shop or something similar.     After we were seated, the whole meal felt rushed.     Our server started by offering only soft drinks, but the place serves beer and wine, too.  The meal seemed to be going downhill from the outset, so I ordered a Diet Pepsi to keep it simple.    When I didn't respond quickly enough for the server after he took my buddy's food order, the server decided he would put my buddy's order in and come back.  Mind you, the place was half empty.    Midway through the meal, another dude, with his arm in my face and his hand on my Diet Pepsi, says, \"can I get this from you?\"  Well, now that your forearm is in my face and your hand is on it, you might as well.    The entire meal was a series of poorly timed interruptions.  For example, how about giving me a chance to try the food before you ask me the perfunctory, \"how is everything?\"  And how about not asking that question when I am lifting the overpriced hamburger to my mouth to take a bite of it?   I'll summarize thusly:  I don't think this place is doing the Venetian any favors."}
{"text":"2 stars because staff was nice!   I couldn't wait to write this review and as soon as I was waiting for the check, I started writing this.   Bathroom was fucking nasty! How about someone clean it?! Made me feel like I stepped into a middle-of-no-where bathroom... Crowd was low class!  Food was HORRIBLE!    The worst burger I've ever had in my life. I requested it with a side of salad, instead of the bun; probably should have just had the bun so it hides the disgusting food and presented me from getting lifeless salad.  Hey McDonald has burgers for a dollar or whatever, what I got here was $15 so I expect this burger to be 15 times better than of McDonald's!!!  Salad was dry and lifeless. No presentation to it, I could have cut that too; that's how immature it looked. The carrots inside had gone bad n I threw them out of my plate.  The meat was just dry! I felt like I was eating rubber plastic. I stopped eating a few times but had to suck it up bc we had to get to things n didn't have time to talk to the manager and hear apologies. I mean food sucks. Nothing to be sorry about!    I asked for olive oil n vinegar, the bottles were soooooo greasy, I just stopped what I was doing to wash my hands; then I saw that nasty bathroom again.   Ugh just horrible   Safe to say won't be coming back"}
{"text":"My Husband and I were in Vegas for Mfest and staying at the Palazzo. We decided to try out I love burgers and we loved it, though the price is a little steep but it is Vegas.   We both went for the Bacon burger I opted for no bacon mayonaise and I was very pleased with it. The bacon that was ground intot he patty was not super apparant but still amazing. Along with our burgers we got the sweet potatoe chips and the mac and cheese.  We both loved the sweet potatoe chips though I was undecided if I liked the caramel cinnamon dip that came with it... made it too much like dessert for me. The mac and cheese was super good too. Perfect crunch and perfect flavoring.  It was a nice compliment to our burgers.  I got the tahitian vanilla shake and man I have to say that it was the best shake I had ever had... even though it was vanilla it had loads of flavor and was just so great though the waitress did kind of forget about it for a little but I will let it slide because it was so good.   Next time we stay at the palazzo I could see us coming back though we do like to try new places whenever we get the chance.  I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a burger in vegas!"}
{"text":"Burger Bar @ Mandalay is better. Too much bun and not enough meat!  Service wasn't so good-saw several mix-ups with customers, tried to give me the wrong food, etc."}
{"text":"Keep in mind you're on the strip soooooooo that means that the tab will be a bit pricey, more than $20 for a burger & fries. FYI fries DO NOT come w/ the burger. The shoe string fries are plentyful & their sauce for it, similar to 1000 island is delicious! I selected the I LOVE Bacon burger, which has bacon strips & bacon mayo. Solid burger to say the least. Sit at the bar if you want to ensure fast service, conversation, & your needs met. Good atmosphere & good people."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the great experience we had.  The food is decent and as expected, but it's Vegas, so there's a lot of options that are probably a bit different and better.  It's the experience that makes this place awesome.  We had a group of 7 girls come in to celebrate a bachelorette party.  It was not super crowded, and we were seated immediately.  None of us quite knew what we wanted, and we knew we didn't want to stuff our faces.  The waiter did not care that we all wanted to share our meals and order kids meals (age 12 and under).  Nor did he care we all walked in with our own drinks and didn't order new drinks.  He was quite possibly the most friendly, outgoing, make your day better waiter that you could ask for.  After our meals, the waiter brought the manager over to meet the bride, who then gave us shots on the house.  You really can't ask for a more personal touch than that.  I had a kids meal burger, although it's plain, you can add on what ever toppings you want.  We ordered all of the different fries for the table, I'd say the sweet potato is my favorite."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it... the burger was great (I had the double one... can't remember the name).  Cooked just right, juicy just like a burger should be.  We found out later that we could've just gone in and sat at the bar... there were happy hour specials for food and alcohol and no line.  Next time that's exactly where I plan to go..."}
{"text":"You definitely don't get what you pay for here. The burgers are tiny and tasteless, you get maybe a handful of fries, and if you just want some tap water you still have to fork over $2.50 for a dinky cup. It's ridiculous. Came here starving, left very dissatisfied. Not the place for people who love burgers."}
{"text":"I like it! Not necessarily something I might crave, I don't think, but a good place to go when you want a burger in Town Square. Try their truffle fries!   The employees were friendly and accommodating and the place was pretty clean. They've got a bar inside as well if you'd like to have a couple drinks.  I really like their patio area when it's nice out or in the evenings. I also saw they have a back room for larger parties if that's ever an option, although that's nothing I've seen for myself."}
{"text":"Had the Dante burger and regular fries. Good burger and fries. A cut above most but nothing overly exceptional. Additional pluses - they sever alcohol (they are after all in Vegas) and the service was good.   Set your expectations for a good burger with good service in a nice setting and you will have a very enjoyable experience. And the price is reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"The burger was actually great, and filling. The drinks weren't particularity good.   Service was nice and price was a bit high (even for Vegas standards)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite when we first arrived to the Palazzo.  Since it was close to dinner time we shared the Standard sliders and an order of onion rings.  The sliders consisted of four small angus beef burgers with lettuce, pickles, tomato, onion and thousand island dressing.  They were good, pretty basic burgers.  The onion rings were crispy and also pretty good.  Our server, Traci was very sweet.  I ordered a glass of Cabernet and when I asked her what winery it was from, she promptly brought out the bottle to show me.  Very good service, food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Hard to find and tucked away but what a great surprise.  Stumbled on to it during a morning walk and tried the Heart and Seoul Scramble which is one the the best breakfast meals ever.  Had a perfect  Bloody Mary.  Great staff. Thanks for your service to our country, Sean,  and to me today!"}
{"text":"I Love Burgers also, apparently, Loves your $$$.  My girlfriend and I had lunch there and two burgers, drinks and sides was 54 dollars! Considering where it is, I suppose it is about what you'd expect but I did experience some \"sticker shock\"  The Burgers were excellent, and the I Love Bacon Burger was bacon-y enough it didn't need anything else on it.    If price is in no way an issue to you, its a great place to stop in for a gourmet burger."}
{"text":"Great place for Breakfast at a burger joint!  It's so convenient for Palazzo guests - just take elevator to 2nd floor and it's right around the corner. You can grab a breakfast sandwich, burrito, omelette, skillet, pancakes, or something really different and be on your way super quick.   No better way to fight a Vegas hangover!"}
{"text":"They market themselves as gourmet burger joint but in all honesty it's a decent burger. It's not a fast food place so it takes about 15-20 min for your order to come out.  It's all made fresh.   If there is a convention downstairs at the Sands Convention Center this place does get busy for lunch.  Although it definitely beats the lines in convention floor, which is usually slop served in a trough. No thank you.   If you want something fairly quick and decent be sure to try them. Oh and don't forget to try the tater tots."}
{"text":"This place is easy, it is large so there will probably be seating and the menu is straight-forward. But I do agree with the other reviewers that there isn't really anything special about the food and therefore isn't worth the price. I truly think you  get a better quality meal at the quarter of the price by going to in and out burger or something. This is the type of place you probably won't be coming back to but it gets the job done if you are nearby and hungry."}
{"text":"I love burgers. My bf LOVES burgers. So as a couple together, we DEFINITELY love burgers.   But...I love burgers, you kinda broke my heart! You definitely didn't show me the love. I was a little disappointed and heart broken after eating here.  We were staying at the Palazzo and wanted a quick lunch to help us absorb all the alcohol from the night before.  When I saw that there was a restaurant called I love burgers, you just HAVE to try it right?  First off, did any of you think it was hard finding the place? The Palazzo Hotel is seriously sometimes super hard to navigate around.  For some reason, I always have a hard time finding my way back to my room.  Everything looks so all the effing same that I can't tell the difference between being in the Palazzo hotel or Venetian.   Finally after some time finding the place, we got seated for our lunch.  The BF ordered the Inferno and I ordered the Seoul.  I'm Korean so maybe it was a mistake ordering a \"Korean\" burger at a random joint but the burger was not very good.  The kimchi kinda tasted funny that the mix of sriracha and kimchi tasted off. The BFs Inferno wasn't that much better either.  He was expecting his burger to be spicy but even I thought it wasn't spicy enough.  There are definitely better burger joints in the Vegas strip.  Disappointingly enough, I love burgers just doesn't make the cut."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. I would highly recommend you try this place. My wife and I shared a burger and Parmesan fries, both were excellent."}
{"text":"Wow...considering the mixed reviews here, I had to chime in as well.  I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who offered to seat me, or redirect me to the bar, if I preferred.  My choice should be obvious.  The bartender was great.  Very engaging, made some good drink specials, and chatted the whole time.  I had the inferno burger, which I thought was delicious.  A spicy burger that is ACTUALLY spicy!  Finally!  I'm sooooo bored with all the lame attempts to appease the masses by marketing a spicy dish that disappoints on the Scoville scale.  (I think I've mentioned that I have to plead with my Thai food servers that I really mean 10....maybe even 11)  Our group also shared some onion rings, fried pickles, and fried mac & cheese.  I'm not a fan of mac & cheese anyway, so I won't elaborate on that one, but the onion rings were top notch.  Great crisp, fresh sweet onions, and good dipping sauce.  The fried pickles were amazing!  I love that they use full length sandwich slices and batter fry them.  I would just order those next time.  I think this is a good little spot.  I'll return there for lunch or happy hour for sure."}
{"text":"I love that the place is laid back and not a fancy dine in restaurant like so many of the eateries at Town Square, especially with children in tow. The menu is straight to the point, not too many to choose from, but just enough. Kids eat free on Wednesday and Sunday. Our family had the standard burger combo, inferno burger combo, and kids meals all with natural cut fries and drinks. Prices were great and the meals filled us up. The beef is fresh and grass fed and I could tell by the quality of the meat. Fries were fine and a large amount. Free refills on drinks. Customer service was awesome from the cashier to the server who brought our food to the table! Been here twice and no complaints. Show military ID and get a discount!"}
{"text":"I Love I Love Burgers!  Fries are amazing, portions are huge!  Fried pickles are the best; I won't eat them from anywhere else. Get the Heart and Soul burger.  It's like a festival of awesomeness in your mouth!  Oh and this place gives a generous discount to the military.  Gotta love that too.  Kids love the sliders!"}
{"text":"Everytime i go to Vegas i catch myself coming to I Love Burger.  Part of the reason is due to the fact that i always stay at Palazzo and the other part is because of their  Happy hour and their Bacon Bloody Mary which seems to cure my hangover from the party the day/night before.  Location:  ILB is located on the 2nd floor where all the stores are.  It is extremely hard to find and feels like a maze due to every turn looking the same.  I would highly recommend asking someone it is at.  Till this day i still get lost looking for it.  Food:  The burgers are good...nothing special or amazing for it.  Price is a little steep but your in vegas...everything is going to be on the high side.  The size of the burgers are pretty decent as it will fill u up.  The garbage fries which consist of cheese, chili, jalepeno etc was decent the first time i tried it but since then i opt for the parmesan garlic cheese fries which is really good if you like garlic and cheese.  Drinks:  The thing i love most about this place is their happy hour.  However, you have to be at the bar to get this pricing.  The drinks are strong and very good.  The blood mary is a must get as a breakfast drink if you have a hangover and know ull be partying later that day."}
{"text":"Although I thought the burger was a 4 star burger it was priced like a 5 star burger ($16). Garbage Fries, 4 stars, $9. They had a decent selection of craft beer, although not special enough to make it a destination for someone looking for craft beer.  The Good: BBQ burger: (American cheese, bacon, barbeque sauce, lettuce, tomato and onion strings) I did enjoy this quite a bit but it certainly wasn't a $16 burger. The BBQ sauce had a good flavor, there was a generous helping of bacon and the burger was juicy.    Garbage Fries: (fries with chili, jalapeños, green onion, cilantro, black olives and aged cheddar cheese sauce) This is exactly the gooey, greasy, kinda mess it sounds like, but it's also pretty damn tasty!   The Bad: The service at the bar definitely left something to be desired. I finished my first beer with my fries and wasn't asked if I wanted another until my burger arrived 10 minutes later, even though the bar tenders were not busy and kept walking past me. After I finished my burger and beer I sat watching the game on the TV, again they never asked if I'd like another beer. If they had been running around, working their butts off that would have been one thing but they were just absently wandering around B.S. ing with each other.  The Indifferent: For a burger joint they have a nice selection of craft beer. It's good enough if you're there for a burger but if you are looking for a selection that contains unusual, limited release, or hard to find seasonal's don't bother stopping here.  I could have easily given them 4 stars for the food but they lost one for the service and another for charging for a 5 star burger but only delivering a 3 1/2 or 4 star burger."}
{"text":"Good burger and dog.  Great shake.  Great service.  Fast in.   Manager checked on us.   Fries a little cold.   A bit pricey but so is rest of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service was flat out terrible. They quoted having communication problems, but it was just a disastrous mess of customer service. We waited 30 mins for our food without being checked up on. Only plus was the better than average chicken sandwich I had.  DTM out."}
{"text":"I love burgers serves a great burger but the prices are astronomical and the service is hit and miss.  Staying at the Palazzo, the family and I wanted to grab a quick burger before catching a show. Being pretty much in the hotel \"I love burgers\" seemed a great place to try.  When we were seated by the hostess we were put in a group of tables that we didn't like (and didn't ask for).  When we asked to move, we were told that the other sections were shut down until later.  After seeing that another group of patrons were sat where we requested, we asked our server and were moved (strange). Things started well with a friendly waitress that explained the menu... So we ordered a few burgers and the\"Garbage Fries\".  We received our food fairly quickly and then were left to eat.....for a really long time. Having a few issues with my plate (burger undercooked - raw in the middle and a dried out pickle), I waited patiently for my waitress to return.  After waiting 15 min. and watching my family finish half if their meal, I called out to another passing employee to send my server over.  My server came and with measured contempt listened to me and then... without a word took my plate and left (really strange).  She did return relatively soon with a replacement and everything was made right but it was a weird vibe (like she was barely tolerating me). Honestly, I was really trying to be nice about it.  The problem is this. When you charge $17 for a burger it better be perfect. Although the food was very good, I think I just had a bad experience. My family seemed to really like the food so almost everyone was happy.  Then came the bill....  3 Burgers and one shared order of fries... $78.00. No joke. With tip that makes a quick lunch for 3 here almost $100. Just too expensive for the product. The food is pretty good but, the odd service issues and the astronomical prices make it a poor value. Sorry, but 3 stars is all I can give. I gave the rest at the register!!"}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Service was great. Prices were HIGH even for Vegas. $70 for 2 burgers and 2 draft beers amd one order of poutine fries seemed really high. Food and service were excellent though. Better burgers available for less in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yummy! This chain has been on our list of places to try and we did so tonight. The shakes are to die for. The burgers were unique and tasty. Tater tots were perfectly cooked. Fried pickles were interesting in a good way. It was a little on the spendy side but we were super satisfied with our meals so it was fine. And the service was AWESOME. We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"SOooooo honored we were the first to write about I love Burgers at the soft opening and we present when the doors opened ...The food and cocktails were amazeing !!!! Great job guys :)  The Cuisineist Culinary Magazine VINO LAS VEGAS LLC"}
{"text":"Come on close this Place or make Good Food.   Burgers are spoooo  tiny i mean tiny. Mc donalds tiny Size i mean, Same quality but you Pay 6$ for it.  Fries ok nothing Special. I m picky with my Food but this Place Sucks.   If you are hungry Skip this Place.   I forgot the awfull Desserts. Even they are .... Come on!"}
{"text":"Venue:  I Love Burgers  Decor: Johnny Rockets style Like  Service: Friendly  Environment: Pretty cool, flat screens to watch sports  Food: Mainly Burgers   Prices:  For the taste..overpriced   Debbie Downers:  The Burger iteslf   Conclusion: The best thing on your meal should not be the milkshake.  Yes, although the strawberry milkshake that I did have was delicious, it must not,...i repeat must not be better than the burger.  I had the Korean Burger and it was just a disappointment.  Plus for the quality of food, I thought it should have been cheaper.  Don't pay in the upper teens, low 20's for an average burger...and that's what this was...Average.   Overall: D"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, delicious, healthy options, kind staff, and much more. This place saved my trip with the $15 salmon salad. Huge Piece of salmon, tons of greens, and a delicious citrus vinaigrette. Thanks again! I love burgers!"}
{"text":"Venetian is awesome because of their great rooms, their fine dining, their clubs, and their extravagant ambiance.  What they sorely lack is quality casual dining.  Grimaldi's is the only reasonable casual dining eats (outside of the food court).  Unfortunately, this restaurant is one to stay away from  Burgers are very average to below average.  Fries are average.  Fried Mac and Cheese is flavorless (but free with your yelp check in).  Prices are high for what you get .    The positives of this place are the abundant beer options, their garbage fries (chili cheese fries with cilantro and jalapeno), portion size.  But if you're craving burgers, go to another hotel to get your fix.  If you want better casual eats in Venetian, then go to Grimaldi's or the food court.  But, if you're not wanting Pizza or Panda Express, then you need to get out of Venetian for your Vegas Cheap eats."}
{"text":"Ordered the Caprese Burger and was pleasantly surprised. Good and not over powering with the Balsamic. Buffalo mozzarella was fresh and very tasty.   Service was quick. We're here on a Sunday evening before a movie. We ordered ate and were out the door in 20 minutes.   I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife went their and the customer service was very good we both had Kobi loco, we had the beef rare and that's what they delivered, The beef was tasty and buttery YUM! The owner or manager was great to talk to. As for the $$ it's lower then most of the other restaurants in a casinos and it is in one. Couple from AK"}
{"text":"I got right in and waited ten minutes for a waitress.  Ordered caprese burger and poutine fries.  Doesn't anyone season their burgers?  It was good but too much balsamic.  Fries didn't have much gravy but were tasty anyway."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I had the Standard burger and shared a few fries. I liked that it says the restaurant's name on the bun of the burger. It's very filling; six hours after eating, I still wasn't hungry. Service was good. The waiter was friendly and promptly gave us our drinks and check."}
{"text":"This place is the worst burger I've ever had. The bun was ice cold. The manager was so kind to not charge me for it. Huh. Uneatable.  I only had one bite. I'm not hard to please."}
{"text":"I actually do love burgers and I did not love this place.  Hate would be a strong word... but strong dislike is absolutely on the mark.    I got their bacon burger, which was supposed to have an overload of bacon, but didn't.  I ordered the burger \"medium rare\" which is how I usually get it, but for some reason got it raw instead.  It was so undercooked that it didn't fully warm in the middle.  I took a couple bites and feared that if I continued I would feel sick.  So I stopped.  We also got some Parmesan garlic fries and sweet potato fries, both of which were pretty limp and disappointing.  Even if the burger was cooked ok, it would still have been overpriced and underwhelming.  Plenty of good food spots in Vegas, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"With so many options in Las Vegas I never thought a hamburger place would win me over. Not only are their hamburgers amazing, but what made the experience spectacular was the service from the entire staff.    Mark, Manny and Sean were especially welcoming and went out of their way to make our visits great.    They also serve a great breakfast and a Hooray Happy hour!   Will definitely be back every time I'm in Vegas.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place as it is overpriced and underwhelming is the best way to put it.    The \"I Heart Bacon\" burger was definitely not worth the $17 bucks.  Sure it came with a lot of bacon, but the actual patty was horrible and I couldn't even taste the bacon mayo.  The beef patty seriously tasted as if it came from Costco (the Kirkland brand ones, not the nice juicy ones in the meat section) as the patty was thin-ish, not packed together to make a heavy patty and also not cooked very well at all.   For the money I expect a non-anorexic burger with all the sides and toppings.  Moreover, for that money they don't even include fries or a drink with that...WTF the kids meal for $7 came with a burger, drink, and fries.  If you are starving and coming here for food just get the kids meal and move on to bigger and better burgers like at Hash House in Imperial Palace."}
{"text":"We started two of our days here and were blown away.....the Bloody Mary with bacon was terrific.  I had the heart and soul and then a Mexican dish.....both were great tons of flavor in both although the edge goes to the hear and soul.  The wife had the Greek yogurt parfait and a Hawaiian dish and was unable to finish either....def would plan on coming back.  I loved the fact the manager/ owner was walkin around at 8:00am to see if everyone was enjoying themselves"}
{"text":"This place is an example of why Vegas is shit. You can buy a burger or a hooker for the same price.  Next time... I'm going for a hooker instead."}
{"text":"4 stars because the service was quick but the food was nothing special  It would have been nice to know the large beer was so darn big and came with a big cup too but oh well, it's funny now."}
{"text":"Service was great! Our service was funny and very attentive. I got the love and Seoul burger and it was pretty yummy! I also got the banana cheesecake...bomb! I definitely recommend this place whenever in Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"Forget all those burger places overlooking the Strip, this burger place, hidden in a corner of the Palazzo shops has excellent burgers, not very cheap but of excellent quality.  My favorite was the \"Dante\", made of delicious Angus beef, blue cheese, caramelized onions and roasted garlic alioli; super tasty! And the fact that they had 2-for-1 cocktails if you were seating at the bar was also appreciated. Service was corteous but on the slow side, we were seating at the bar and the place was almost empty, still we had already finished our drinks before the burgers came."}
{"text":"1 star is only for a decent shake.  The burgers that were served to our group of six people were burned to a crisp.  There was literally a hard burned shell around the burgers, including a standard burger, 2 black bean veggie burgers, and 2 orders of sliders.  The waiter literally admitted that the sliders are always either \"burned or raw\" since they are \"only 2 ounces each.\"  We were in a big rush to get to the airport so couldn't spend time to speak with the manager.  Many of us ended up leaving our food almost entirely uneaten.  Stay far away from this restaurant.  I have no idea how they can call themselves a burger joint."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese cubes are pretty good! I also ordered the salmon salad! The salmon was fresh and didn't taste fishy!(: but the fries were super good!"}
{"text":"I have eaten burgers and fries all around the world. It's interesting to me these days, that burgers are back in \"vogue\" as there are burger joints popping up everywhere with their take on what a great burger should be.   While the ambiance of this place is pretty nice- bar along the one wall serving plenty of craft beers and pouring a fine drink, and blond wood accents and tables in the middle- the food is just okay and for $23 for a burger and fries- I was expecting a lot more.   I sat at the bar cuz this place was hopping. The line was out the door and the \"To Go\" window up front had people 5 deep (one guy told me it was going to e 30 minutes for to go orders so know that this is not \"fast food\") I ordered a Pepsi (watered down- poor ratio of syrup to water and at $3.25 I expected perfection) and began to look at the menu.   Plenty of burgers made out of everything from beef to turkey to tuna to buffalo. There are 5 or 6 kinds of fries from shoestring to potato wedges served with ONE sauce (you pay extra if you want more than one). I went with the red pepper aioli which was pretty good.   The problem? They don't ask how you want your burger cooked. So I said , Can I have mine medium?\"- and the guy said, \"Okay\". Imagine my surprise when it came out med rare and when I questioned it- the server told me the chef prefers to serve it that way. What? I didn't send it back but I was a little worried as according to my server- the meat comes in whole and they grind it at the location and hand form the patties. Too many chances to have something go wrong with fresh ground beef to eat it undercooked, but that's just me (too many food safety classes, I guess)   The burger came with mayo already on the bun (wish I had been told that too) with lettuce, tomato, red onion and I paid extra ($2) for a slice of cheese. It was a hearty \"bar \" type burger with a soft brioche bun but nothing really stood out. I could have had an Angus burger at McDonald's for half the price and more toppings (like a pickle).   As for the fries- I went with the \"baked potato fries\" which were really just fat wedge fries. They came in a cute bowl and were hot, hot, hot! But even the red pepper ailoi sauce couldn't jazz them up enough.   This place has a ton of potential but it needs to get through it's growing pains and figure out what makes these new \"burger bars\" successful. It's friendly service, food cooked the way a customer wants it and no long waits. For me? If I'm going to splurge my day's calories on a burger and fries- it had better be worth it. And this just wasn't."}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Palazzo, this is a super-convenient gourmet hamburger place right to the left on the second floor as you get off the elevator! It usually is not busy and the food is pretty good.  I found myself returning multiple times during my stay.   Like any self-respecting modern hamburger place, they have several exotic burger options, as well as many different beers on tap.  Although things can get a bit pricey, they do have a great happy hour with half-price appetizers and deals on drinks (which I enjoyed on more than one occasion during my stay).  If you order a large beer, you can bring the cup back later for a $5 discount on the next beer.    The receipt you get is also good for 25% off of a breakfast order - and although I didn't try it, I heard good things about it.  If you are looking for something quick, easy, and pretty good, this place will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"ordered the salmon burger. it was spicy, which the menu doesn't really mention. the spice totally overpowered the rest of the burger. also, $2 to add 3 dinky slices of avocado? ugh. also got tater tots which were ok but i'm not entirely convinced they weren't just ore ida tater tots... the waiter was a little condescending and acted like we were an inconvenience to him, although we didn't do much other than say the food was fine when he asked.  it's also loud, and the decor is weird and out-of-place in the palazzo. what's with the weird, red, bladder-looking thing towards the end of the restaurant? the grass on the wall? so many question marks for this place.   skip it and try BLT across the street at mirage. much better, IMO."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  My husband was not either which he is a die hard for hamburgers & hot dogs, I guess there is another burger joint not far from where we were which had better reviews.  Also there us a pinks in the strip"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the boyfriend today, and I had a decent experience there.  Can't really comment on their style of customer service, since the cashier seemed to be just there when we ordered our food. Same goes for servers bringing your food to you. It was like going to a high end In-N-Out to me. Eh. Decent food. I liked their regular fries 'cause they were cooked crispy. Found their stamped buns cute. Of course, I liked their Coffee Bean shake the most! Really took my time on that one, so I could finish it at work.  The boyfriend liked it enough too. We've already decided that if we have another random lunch date here... I'd try the Love & Seoul, and he'd get the Inferno."}
{"text":"Not really something to rave about, the burgers are ok what gives it the 1 star is the price. Too expensive for a burger that is average."}
{"text":"A lot of people like to compare this place to Umami Burger. It's a solid comparison, but there are a few things that make this place better:  1. Spikes milkshakes. That's right, spiked milkshakes. Or double spiked. Either way, the oreo one was delicious. The booze complimented the milkshake excellently.   2. Fried pickles. But these aren't your average fried pickles...they are tempura fried pickles. Oh dear lord, they were absolutely outstanding. They were made possible by Tim, their resident bartender/server/chef/all-around awesome guy.   3. They really know their way around bacon.  4. They have a really large selection of burgers and delicious appetizers. If your not adventurous enough to try the friend pickles (your loss), do NOT ignore the mozzarella sticks.   If you're in Vegas preparing for a crazy night, or recovering from one, this is the place to go. I can vouch for the \"I Heart Bacon and Eggs Burger,\" simply because I do, in fact, heart bacon, eggs and burgers.   Eat and drink here and tip well. They deserve your money."}
{"text":"Came here without checking Yelp randomly as we were walking by. Mistake. Burger was full of grease (not like a normal burger amount) so much so that I didn't even eat it. It has to be really bad for me to waste food too. There wasn't one other person here on a Saturday afternoon which should have been a sign. My boyfriend also received a well done burger after asking for med-rare. Neither of us were too pleased. Also, my water had a bug in it.  I am giving two stars purely based on the service. Our waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food and service was great here!  I am super satisfied and glad to have made this my first meal on this Vegas trip.  We are staying here at the Venetian and just stumbled on this place and we loved the look and feel.  Our hostess was super pleasant and gave us her favorites, (which we ended up trying) and our waiter was awesome!  Attentive, funny, patient and on top of them refills!  We will be going back for breakfast as we did get a 25% off coupon and were promised that their breakfast menu is equally satisfying."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot late night. We ordered a few appetizers: the chicken fingers, the fried pickles, and the fried mac & cheese nom noms (NOM is right!). All were great, especially the fingers and noms (nobody does fried pickles like the South--spears can't hang with chips). Cheeseburger with bacon rounded it out, great meal."}
{"text":"Burgers were good and staff were very nice and helpful. I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat before heading  out for the night."}
{"text":"Service was quick and really attentive, the I Heart Seoul Burgers were AMAZING! It was a bit messy to eat but honestly that's to be expected with eggs over easy-so I won't complain, just enjoyed the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. The people are always so nice and I get my food pretty quickly even if there is a large rush. The happy hour is pretty nice and having a burger and a beer is always a good combination.   The appetizers are really good especially the Nom Noms (fried mac and cheese) and they have a lot of options whether you eat beef or not. I don't usually eat beef so I get their black bean burger. I've had plenty of vegetarian burgers and I must say that this one is one of the best one's I've had. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was happily surprised by this place! Full disclosure, and the reason for an extra star (and my visit in the first place): they offered a generous BOGO standard burger dinner special for CCSD employees for Teacher Appreciation Week!   My guy and I each got the standard, adding cheese (cheddar for me, gouda for him), and shared the truffle fries and a drink. Mad props for having a variety of cheeses to add on: bleu, American, cheddar, gouda, pepper jack, etc were all options, along with japalenos, carmelized onions, bacon, and avocado. Almost added the onions to our burgers but ultimately decided not to.  Service was quick and friendly while we placed our orders. Dining room was clean and condiments/drink station and tables were clean. Order was out quickly.  Burgers were thick, and served medium rare- perfect! Cheese was just melted and veggies were fresh and crisp. Did not detect additional condiments on my burger, but the bun and juices from the patty did not have a dry taste, which is admirable. Truffle fries were $3, ample and shareable portion served perfectly cooked and crisp. Very tasty with light dusting of what seemed to be sea salt. Would order again, appreciated that the truffle flavor was light and not overwhelming.  Will have to go again and try a specialty burger... and those onions! Table signage and website showed several daily HH specials and deals that I will be sure to take advantage of next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We were here on Monday night and I must admit I didn't do my homework first. First of all the place was not even half full at a prime dinner hour. Once we were seated I thought a server would be right over. Nope! They were too busy grab assing in the back. Did the hostess even bother to give them a heads up? Uh, no. That might be too far for her to walk. So once they spotted us our server was on top of his game. They have some decent burger concoctions here. I just happened to pick the one that has to be spot on for all the flavors to come together. I'm not sure that's even possible with the Heart and Seoul Burger. But when the patty is charred it totally ruins this burger. Yes I told my server and the manager showed up and I should have sent it back. I also pointed out to our server that you can see the cooks chatting away as they are cooking. Ok so they comped a desert big deal. The biggest disappointment was the Garbage Fries. That's what they are called, as I found out for good reason. When you throw a bunch of stuff on fries that have been sitting under a heat lamp instead of freshly made fries that's why you get them so quickly. My wife's burger was just OK. We both agreed that any Islands burger is probably better than any burger here. This is all on management here. Pay more attention to the back of the house and you can change that."}
{"text":"I definitely did NOT love burgers here!  My burger was dry and bland.  The bun was dry.  The burger was small.  It was expensive.  The sides are extra.  We got the garbage fries which were OK but small for $9.  Yea yea it's Vegas so everything is expensive.  But I'd rather spend my $20-30 elsewhere.  The service was great though, but yea... not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"For a burger place they don't ask how you want it cooked, not many options and the service is mediocre.. Sorry and they is plastic cups for sodas instead of reusable .. Super wasteful not environmentally friendly"}
{"text":"The natural cut fries I had were delicious and everyone else's food looked amazing too! The shakes were very tasty too and HUGE portions they give you are a big plus."}
{"text":"We only had a milkshake, but darnit, it was the BEST shake ever. It was cherry and chocolate and alcohol. What more could you want! Also, its enough to split, so $5 a person doesn't seem so bad."}
{"text":"I think a strong 3.5 stars for my visit.  It's located in Town Square tucked away on the northwest side of the area.  Parking in the North Parking garage would get you there quick and easy.    I wasn't sure what type of restaurant this was.   We walked in for lunch.  It was a pretty early lunch so there weren't too many people here.  There isn't an extensive menu so ordering at the counter before sitting down was pretty easy.   The cashier/waitress was a little ho-hum about customers.  Not overly enthusiastic or friendly.     We decided to split the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and Nom Nom's on the side for the hubs.  Nom Nom's are a fried mac n cheese side with a cheese dipping sauce.  I thought they were just ok but nothing to write home about.   The burger was good.  Cooked perfectly and not too large.  The bacon was the star of the burger.  Great flavor and plenty of it on top.   Sweet potato fries ~ Oh how I love thee!  I must have an addiction to them.  They were crisp with a light and sweet flavor to them.    Would I dine again?  Maybe. But I wouldn't go rushing back."}
{"text":"Truffle fries addicting Triple Chocolate Shake a Must Oregon Trail Was pretty tasty, I substituted red onion for onion straws.  I would come back.  It would be better maybe if there was waiter service instead of order than sit."}
{"text":"We had a party of four that were famished from a 110 degree morning spent drinking and swimming at the pool. When we came in and asked for a round of waters they came out really quick with them and kept them full throughout our meal.    My husband and I split an I love bacon burger and ordered mac & cheese bites and fried pickles for the table.  The mac & cheese bites were the best I've ever had. I was glad that the burgers don't come with fries so I could indulge in these and not feel as guilty!  The fried pickles were really good too.  They were cut thin and fried.  Many places fry the spears and it's like an explosion of hot liquid when you bit into the pickles.  This place has it just right.  The burger was really tasty.  They are thick patties and quite a decent size so if you don't want to feel too full I'd recommend splitting the burger like my husband and I did.  We didn't eat breakfast and it was around 3PM when we finally ate here. This is the only food we ate all day and we were content.  The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is that the waitress was really pushy about drink specials.  Its Vegas so I know this is what she has to do (you could tell) but the company shouldn't have their employees try so hard to push drinks on people. ."}
{"text":"Came here just for a quick bite to eat. This I Love Burgers is located in the Palazzo Shops, just a few steps away from our hotel elevator at the Palazzo. As soon as we stepped in, the hostess seated us right away but it took the server longer that it should to come over and acknowledge us. I almost got up to leave when she came. While she was pleasant and we didn't wait to long to get our food, wait service wasn't a priority with her since she purposely hid behind the pillars to gab with staff.  Why I say she did this on purpose?? I was wondering where she was a good five minutes. Mr. B needed a drink refill. I saw her then step out from behind a white pillar at the back of the restaurant  I was about to catch her attention when she jumped back behind the white pillar and kept talking to her co worker. lol...jeez!   I guess her conversation was more important.  The Angus burger sliders and  Mac and Cheese Nom Noms were good. Portion wise just right and prices were your tourist trap prices. I expected that. Just didn't expect inattentive service. So our dining experience for this visit was A-Okay."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the area of the Palazzo and the Venetian when we went to the wax museum, and we were pretty hungry so we decided to walk around and see what there was in the food court area. I Love Burgers looked decent and expresses a sentiment that I feel, so we opted to go there. It was fairly busy when we were there, but we were seated right away so it wasn't terrible.  Service was excellent all around. I can't remember our waitress' name, but she was great and gave many good recommendations when we told her it was our first time at their restaurant. I saw that they had spiked shakes and I knew we had to get one. We went with the Twisted Caramel Corn and it was spectacular. Our waitress said they were a pretty good size, so we decided to split it and they even put it in separate glasses for us, which was nice.  I opted for the Wagyu Kobe beef burger, which was amazing. It was super juicy and rich and just everything that I expected it to be. Yes, it was a $25 hamburger but it was worth it. And, even though my stomach was stretched to capacity, you're damn right I ate every bit of it. My boyfriend got the Oregon Trail which was a buffalo burger and he was raving about that as well. We split an order of the Parmesan Garlic fries, and those were super delicious too.  It was definitely kind of pricey for what you actually get, I think we ended up paying about $75 after tax and tip but the spiked shakes were kind of on the pricey side. So if you don't get one of those, I would say $50 for two people could easily be achieved. I know there are practically a million restaurant options in Vegas, but this one was pretty good and who doesn't love a good burger?  Oh, and whoever said that it feels like you're in a giant mushroom house, they are absolutely right! You'll understand if you go."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food was to die for! Inside the palazzo so there's so many beautiful sights to see. I had the loco moco for breakfast and I have never tasted a breakfast so good. No boring food here!"}
{"text":"Ok - so this fine burger joint is located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo. I came here just for some sanity and to eat my first meal of the day after arriving from the airport and checking in. This place has free wi-fi. A very cool feature. Not just your ordinary burger place, you have all sorts of interesting burger choices. Once I had some fish (I think it was ahi) and this last time I had the eggplant. Yeah. It's just me. I always gotta try the stuff that's \"different.\" So this place also has all sorts of beer as well. You can't get that at McDonald's - so that's why I was \"lovin' it\" over here. Most of the waitresses here were eye candy quality so that was another plus. How many burger places offer Delerium Tremens? That's what I thought. Yeah - it all ain't cheap.  10 bucks for a burger. But it's Vegas."}
{"text":"It's overpriced since you're basically paying the Palazzo markup. Burger plus chips plus drink will leave you paying $20 once tax and tip are included.  The burgers are okay but at those prices they should be better than okay and don't compare to several of the suddenly trendy gourmet burger joints.  The website touts that its menu is simple and straight forward. Weird thing is the menu has chips located in the fries section so I thought they would be what the English call \"chips\". However they were the American style potato chips. The waitress recommended them and the sweet potato variety cost more than its sweet potato fry counterpart. Had a taste of both and the fries definitely tasted better than its chips counterpart."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars. Here's why I didn't.   I went in to the restaurant on my final day of a four-day conference. I was not in a super rush to get to the airport, but I didn't have all day, either. It took my waiter 20 minutes for him to introduce himself. Ok, I have enough time, I thought. No biggie. When he did show up, he was friendly and knowledgeable of the food (they are burgers, by the way.  After looking over the entire order, I decide on the buffalo burger with aged cheddar, sweet potato fries and a strawberry shake.   The burger and fries took about 20 minutes to show up. Ok, still have enough time. Where is my shake?  The burger was excellent. It was like biting into a soft, meaty pillow!  The fries were excellent. Just enough sweetness and saltiness. FINALLY, my shake shows up! Just in time to get my check, because I know how long it takes to get from The Venetian to the airport...  Paying my check was the quickest part of the experience.   The tastiness of my burger was what saved this place and why I will go again on my next trip to Vegas. Because the service was slooooow.   5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the slowness."}
{"text":"$14 for a meal, and still hungry afterwards. Very overpriced for such a small burger. Fries are small and soggy. First time and last time , be warned, every body!"}
{"text":"We came here with a group of friends this last weekend. For folks first time here, from the parking garage go to the shops floor instead of the casino, its near the rare book store. We got seated right away and ordered a round of waters to start. My friend and I each got a burger and split it, was tasty and good, but I want to write about the fries, the garbage fries were very tasty and worth splitting. The other fries were not that good :)"}
{"text":"The standard burger is a little small and dry the fries were ok but service was slow at time we came in door no one at counter to take our order"}
{"text":"Extraordinarily disappointing. Burger patty was dry and overdone, but bacon was cold and cheese not melted somehow. Fries were underdone, with cold dry potato in the middle of the wedge. The $7 milkshake will not be getting any praise from Vincent Vega. At $35/person, it's steakhouse prices in highchair googie decor. Service was friendly, but slow, though they were good about refilling water. The brioche was very tasty; I wish the burger lived up to it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, both busy and not busy and the service and food are consistently good. I really love the BBQ burger. Their sides are pretty good too. The milkshakes may take some time to come out but they are totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Well as far as the environment and vibe from the staff it was great but for the price of the burger no thank you. It was not cooked to the way I specified and the only thing that made it special was the stamp on the top of the bun. Look for more options in the casino or on the strip better."}
{"text":"Due to budget cuts, I Love Burgers at this location has cut back on their menu items. No longer do they have burgers like the Plymouth or sweet potato fries. Their burger selection is down to six: Standard, Inferno, I Love Bacon, BBQ, Chicken, and Garden. The burgers are delicious, but my favorites are no longer at this location and the burgers are a bit pricy and out of the way at Town Square to really come here often. I did receive my BBQ burger pretty quickly, and again, it was delicious, but I could always go to another burger place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is really great for the price! I ordered the Inferno Burger & my husband ordered the I  Bacon burger. Mine was so spicy, but it was amazing. I also ordered the sweet potato fries, and they were perfect. My husband got the Coffee Bean milkshake which was super creamy and I got a Strawberry Chiller. I don't know what else to say, everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow! One star for the good macaroni and cheese balls.  Burgers had absolutely NO SEASONING AT ALL!! Fries were okay. Service was bad...fries came after we ate half our burgers. This place is definitely OVERRATED! Price is for burgers only..fries are separate. We were a party of six and none of us enjoyed the no-seasoning burgers :( terrible"}
{"text":"The name in the title says it all! I love a good burger and this place did not disappoint. Really great casual setting. We came here for lunch twice because we were staying in the Palazzo and t was super convenient! We came in and sat at the bar.   My friend and I just wanted a smaller meal so we split the Caprese burger. Man oh man! This burger was super juicy and flavorful. Came with melted mozzarella, basil, and a balsamic reduction glaze. One of the best burgers I have had. no joke.   Their parmesan fries were ok. Chicken strips were what you would expect.   I would come back though for that Caprese!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I loved it here. The tattoo is even real on the bun! That's what sealed the deal. Fresh and made to order. We have returned at least 4 times. I told my brother in law about it and even he approved. You must give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick place then this is a decent choice. We had a bean burger, fries and a kale salad. The burgers and salads were good but fries were cold and greasy.  Service was uniquely strange. The server seemed disinterested in us completely....in fact she never spoke a single word to us. Just stood in front of us to take our order and then did the same when we paid - zero interaction in between.  Don't think we'd ever experienced that before....at least it was peaceful. ;-)"}
{"text":"The food was great. Juicy burger and good parm fries. My problem was the service. The waiter John was very rude after not putting our order through properly. One person in the party didn't get their burger till everyone was almost done, and also didn't properly order our fries. He then made it as if it was our fault and we should just deal with it. Then at payment time, he didn't remove the fries as he said he would. He then also double charged one of the guys and didn't charge someone else. It took him more than 20 minutes to rectify this situation."}
{"text":"Ok, after much dismay i decided to give this place another chance.  Lets just say there is a reason why this place is so bad. The computer systems were down and after an hour of waiting for our food, we left. I spoke to the manager and all I got was sorry.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I had in the US.  Really high quality Juicy meat, topped with blue cheese and caramelized onions -  delicious!! I went back the following day to top it off with some fried pickles, YUM.  Service was great as well.   Coming from San Francisco its really hard to find a burger as good as this one...   PLEASE come to the bay area and open i  Burgers there!!!"}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing burger place. I love a good burger andbthis placebdid not orovide that. My burger had absolutely no flavor; seriously McDonald's has better tasting options.  The fries very good and so was the spiked milkshake. But I came here for a great burger and left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Only ate here as I had tickets to a show and kinda wished I'd gotten fast food.  Food quality was just okay, which is definitely not okay for the prices they charge. Bun on burger seemed really generic. Server was attentive. French fries were best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. Pretty ritzy but nothing special more than a neighborhood diner. Cheese nom noms were a cute name for dry noodles with barely any sauce on the inside. At least they were free (at the time) with Foursquare checkin. Fried pickles were interesting, at least they were the only thing that came out hot. The nom noms were warm, but my main course, the quail egg sliders were a total disappointment. It was like the bread was day old and they didn't bother to warm them to a steamy temp. They just looked pre-toasted and even he meat wasn't piping hot. Which I would expect from a burger joint. The service was lackluster, they were just chatting to earn tips, but if you really wanted something, you'd be hard pressed to get their attention. It felt more like I was being questioned about my being there as opposed to friendly welcomes and get to know you's. Tell the manager? You bet I did. And no apology, it was just an \"I'm glad you told me,\" and \"I agree..\" They know they got your money. They just didn't plan on a full review on the poor customer service.  They would have gotten 2 stars if they remedied it, but I'm taking away one star and putting it in the bottom of the barrel. It's kitchy, but really. You can get a better burger at a more upscale place and have your mouth be drooling. This place just sucks. Even the menu was sticky. Gross. Which was exactly how I felt leaving. Not even a goodbye, thank you for coming was uttered to me. Nice front door eye candy, but that's how they get you."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of friends before a night of clubbing this past weekend. I ordered the loco moco, poutine, mac and cheese nom noms, and tried the BBQ burger. The mac and cheese nom noms came with a side of melted cheese. The appetizer wasn't very cheesy and were ehhh. The loco moco gravy was very bland. The beef patty was dry and bland. The poutine had the same gravy as the loco moco and also didn't have much flavor. The BBQ burger was tastier but the beef patty was slightly dry. Overall, the food was meh and probably wouldn't come back since it was a little pricey for subpar food."}
{"text":"I've worked in the service industry for several years when I was younger. I know how simple it is to give quality service to your guests. Let's just say that's not what we received here.  Service was very slow. It seemed like the restaurant was well staffed but the majority of the servers were dancing around and joking by the kitchen instead of paying good attention to all the guests. The restaurant wasn't busy at all while we were there but the food took FOREVER and wasn't hot. The burgers flavor was pretty good but our Caesar salad was terrible. All you could taste was the crazy amount of Parmesan they put on it. We also ordered the garlic parm fries which had no garlic in sight. I do have to admit the fried pickles were AMAZING.  The floors were really dirty. Took so long to get the check. Basically didn't feel like our business was valued at all. I'm going to try Guy Burger grill on the strip next time were in town. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I had The Loco Moco it was \"ok\" nothing special. A little over priced. Service was not great or inviting it could have been more friendlier. Bathrooms didn't have a baby changing station. Atmosphere was nice other then that I'd try another place if your looking for a great tasting food."}
{"text":"So a vegetarian walks into a burger joint.... But seriously, my two partners wanted burgers and this place boasted a veggie burger, so I was sold! Result? Food was good! I did the Inferno Burger with a black bean patty (skip the warm lettuce) and add onion strings. It was yummy, good kick of spice and the patty was charred to perfection, just enough to crispiness. My boyfriend fell in love with the bacon & eggs sliders. He called the mini quail eggs cute- and devoured them. My BFF had the Dante with a turkey patty and loved it- especially the blue cheese. Bad news though!! Service was bad, bad, bad. They need to look at their staffing plans- our server was swamped with too many tables! She was filling drink orders, ringing up checks and helping at least 6 tables; meanwhile, 2 hosts were standing around doing nothing. At least 4 guys were bussing tables and done, standing around with nothing to do. There were at least 4 bartenders, yet they were all standing together taking. My drink never came, and we had no utensils while our food sat at our table. The saving grace was how nice and apologetic our server was!"}
{"text":"Oregon trail was decent and sweet potato fries were good but a little too sweet with cinnamon sugar.  I'd come back maybe to try the chicken"}
{"text":"Ryan was awesome .... breakfast da bomb... highly suugest you stop in.  Cool atmosphere Jetsons meets diner and sports bar..."}
{"text":"OMGoodness I have been coming here to Palazzo & 1st time trying out this place....it's delicious! Love the Loco Moco & skillet &Seoul!  It's cheaper and way better than Grand Lux and I love grand Lux.  I'm coming back!  Best breakfast I've had here in Vegas."}
{"text":"I think I posted my check-in somewhat prematurely when I was only looking at the menu. 3 stars is about right. Everything sounds good, and it's not bad quality but nothing we had was all that unique and the service definitely left something to be desired.  I ha the Oregon Trail Burger, a buffalo pattay with the normal fixin's and an aioli sauce that I couldn't even taste. It was of course pricey because we were on the Strip and it was buffalo.  We also got garbage fries, ground beef, black olices, sour cream, jalapenos, onions, they were alright too, but nothing to write home about.  The vanilla shake was very very good, which brought the experience up, but like I eluded to, our server seemingly forgot about us several times and it wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"There was a 10 minute wait to be seated in order to help the kitchen catch up.  Although not preferable, there are plenty of other shops to check out while you are waiting.  After being seated we received our drinks pretty quickly.  The wait staff was very friendly and EXTREMELY knowledgeable.  We started with Mac'n'Cheese Nom Noms, which were excellent.  We kept the sauce that is served with them for our fries later (which worked out really well).  I had the Caprese burger and my fiancee had the Oregon Trail burger.  The balsamic reduction on the Caprese is what really made the burger.  It had a lot of flavor but didn't over power the burger.   As far as preparation goes, they are the best burgers that either of us ever had.  It was all VERY fresh tasting and prepared perfectly.  It takes a little bit to get the food but that is what I would expect when everything is made to order.  It is also a little pricey but with the portion size and quality coupled with the restaurant location, the price is right on point.  All in all, it was a wonderful experience that I would recommend to anyone.  If a gourmet burger is what you are looking for, then you are going to get exactly that."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I came here to catch up with old high school friends so I was pretty distracted.  I ordered the I love bacon burger.   When the burger came out it looked pretty fancy.  I really liked the fried string onions. The patty itself could have more flavor. It wasn't dry but it was really fatty because of the bacon I guess. I got the sweet potato fries with my burger. They seemed like regular sweet potato fries. Mine could have used more salt.   It's an ok burger place."}
{"text":"Famished from our earlier flight here from Arizona, we were looking for a delicious bite before shopping at the Palazzo.. we wandered into I  heart burgers, and got sat immediately.   Friendly staff, interesting decor (large chalkboard structures with color scheme of black, red and white), interesting menu selections of burgers, milkshakes (you can add alcohol to- yippeee!!) and many different cuts of fries greeted us.   I had the Standard burger (medium well) with string fries and a spiked oreo cookie shake. Kris had the Sirloin burger and orange-sticle spiked milkshake. I believe each milkshake was $12 alone, kinda reminds me of the diner scene from Pulp Fiction where John Travolta and Uma Therman were discussing how a $5 shake was supposed to taste like. Well let's say THIS $12 shake was pretty good for it's money.  Not your place to go to if you're on a budget, mind you, and I know that I can make a bigger and better burger personally, but a unique experience nonetheless. Yikes, bill came to $60 for the both of us. I  heart you burger, but I heart don't  your prices. I know, we're on the strip.. what else can I expect?"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and great service!  Our server Ryan was friendly and very attentive.  She made sure we   ,,. had everything that we needed and made sure that my drink was always full (this is very important in my book).  My wife ordered the happy hour Bloody Mary and truthfully it was the best we've ever tasted!  According to Ryan, the bartender Josh makes the best drinks and we have to agree!  He even took the time to write down his Bloody Mary recipe for us.  We will definitely visit again and again!"}
{"text":"Great burger place with large portions and good atmosphere!   My sisters and I stopped by I Love Burgers at the Shoppes at the Palazzo and decided to share everything that we ordered. I got the BBQ Burger and I really enjoyed the great taste of the barbeque sauce, cheese, bacon, and onion ring combination. One of my sisters tried the I Love Bacon Burger (I had to have a bite because I truly love bacon) and I was surprised at how you could taste the bacon in the burger and the how much the crispy onion straws added to the overall quality of the burger. I definitely recommend this because honestly who doesn't love bacon and it will satisfy any appetite. My other sister got the Chicken Caesar Salad and LOVED it. The dressing was perfect, I think it is house-made and it had a little extra something that made it taste different than other Caesar salads that I have had before.   We also ordered sweet potato fries and onions. When I saw sweet potato fries on the menu I immediately knew that I had to get them and they didn't disappoint! They were crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside. The onion rings were sooo good! The sauce that came with it which tasted like a 1000 island sauce with a kick was complimented them wonderfully!  My sister ordered the Very Spiked Strawberry shake. At first, I was skeptical how a milkshake would taste good with some vodka in it but I shortly changed my mind as it was the BEST shake I have ever had. And even with the alcohol in the shake, I could barely taste it which made it that much better.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my experience here and I will definitely come back again whenever I am in town and craving a burger and/or a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Small burger for $8. Fries were skinny and burnt. Not worth the money. The only nice thing is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant ten minutes before opening. Two of the chefs were outside smoking and engaging in inappropriate conversation about what I could only assume was something to do with their ex girlfriend. Something about not paying her cell phone bill. I'm a biker and don't mind swearing, but it may have offended some other patrons.  At 10:57am the doors were opened and I took that to mean that the business was open as well, so I entered. The two chefs aforementioned had gone back inside by that time and where behind the line prepping. After seeing the counter/bar to be empty, I went over to the pass (kitchen) to ask if they were open (again, two minutes before posted time.) I was told that they were not open for another two minutes and was left to wait at the counter. After the allotted two minutes someone else approached the counter and greeted me. I tried ordering, but they left without warning while I was in mid sentence. Passing this guy on the way back to the kitchen was another worker, who seemed to be a bit out of it. He looked hung over. I ordered my food three times because he couldn't remember three simple items. I then paid and went to my table. I was given a number and told to place it on the salt/pepper shaker.  My food was ready is about five minutes (Ilovebacon burger, fries, and a small drink). The burger itself was cooked to a perfect mid-rare, the bacon was still raw. The fries, which were advertised to be home style were frozen and from a bag. When I was given my food, it was from the first guy who walked off on me. He failed to retrieve my number and just kinda slapped the food down and walked off.  The long story;short of this is: if you want mediocre food and terrible service, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised by some of the bad reviews because my friend & I had a very enthusiastic waitress named Tracee. She made a great suggestion for having the I love bacon burger skipping the Gouda but add Bleu Cheese. So good I didn't need any condiments, not even ketchup! Mind blowing combo with a fabulous spiked shake containing Kahlua & Irish Cream. Best burger & shake combo I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a fast, casual lunch. The burger was good, but got most of it's flavor from being very greasy. Expect to pay about $15-20 for a burger that is on par with Habit."}
{"text":"You don't want to be here.  The food is OK, but the price tag is sky high. I spent $86 for three of us eating one burger and two salads along with a sweet potato fries and two drinks. If you drive 5 minutes, you can have the same meal for less than half of the price with even better quality. It used to be a good place with a reasonable price.   I missed their Shoe-String fries."}
{"text":"service was good but i'm pretty sure the hype isn't worth it. for some reason, i thought it was going to be the best burger place ever! sadly, it's just OKAY.  its quite expensive, no doubt but it was fun eating there.  service was okay. the milkshakes are pretty bomb though. probably won't come back, but i'm glad i tried it."}
{"text":"This place is okay for burgers, I wasn't given the option to have my meat cooked medium rare so that was a bummer thinking I was eating a previously frozen patty. The truffle fries were a little boring. The strawberry milkshake was okay as well. Probably won't go back but if you're starving it's there and okay. Just don't go in with high expectations."}
{"text":"I have eaten at other I Burgers. This experience just didn't do it. Food was good but I felt like I was at a Burger King. The guy taking orders didn't even ask how I wanted my burger done. I overheard the bar staff taking proper orders. While we ate people around us on the patio were heading out and tables were left un touched by staff for at least 10 minutes and that's when we headed out. Burger and tots were good. Great ice. Just a little added attention needed for the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Headline: Get the appetizers, skip the burger.  I love Burgers is in the restaurant and shopping area within the Palazzo / Venetian complex.  It looks like a diner and feels like a diner, but you won't pay like a diner - you'll pay much much more.   First off, what did I like?  Nom Noms - fried pieces of mac and cheese.  They also do a nice selection of beers, including a Chimay Trappist White, which might be my favorite beer, and it goes well with fried food.  These golden nuggets of awesome were delicious, and definitely turning up for.  Unfortunately, that is the only thing good about it.  The burgers were completely tasteless.  I opted for the \"I love bacon\" burger - which I was thinking, given the amount of bacon on and supposedly in it, that it might actually taste good.  It didn't taste good or bad - there was no taste to it.  Really bad.  The sweet potato fries were flat and they didn't come with anything to dip them into.  This was really disappointing.  Service was bad as well.  The burgers came out before the appetizer, the bar screwed up, and we couldn't get the attention of our waitress when we needed her.    So - my advice - sit at the bar, order the Nom Noms, and then leave for some decent food elsewhere."}
{"text":"They have an awesome happy hour! $3 bud lights, $5 wine, $5 absolutes, 1/2 off appetizers. Delicious fried pickles, and chicken tenders with a good chicken-to-breaking ratio (lots of chicken). Bartenders were super friendly. My boyfriend loved the spicy jalapeño burger. Good spot"}
{"text":"food is great  i loved the plymouth burger was so good i would give 5 stars if it wasnt so expensive it vegas but its not a 5 star restaurant or anything its a burger joint it was almost 70 dollars for two people  burgers fries and only two cocktails"}
{"text":"Quick snack like meal- son loved it! Not flashy good service though. Like a fast food chain"}
{"text":"The chiller was way  too sweet . I ask for medium burger  cooked it well done . Kids didn't like the grill cheese ."}
{"text":"This place had always been on my radar to try out and I finally did this weekend. My wife and I were christmas shopping and needed to refuel.   The I love bacon burger I got it was super good the patty was requested well done because my wife is pregnant and it was extremely juicy and delicouse. The size was ok not big or tiny it was a medium size for that and a handful of fries and a drink the combo was $13 a little steep. The truffle fries were really good just not enough. We also ordered the 3 piece chicken fingers which was great to have options instead of only burgers for a burger place. But when we received it we were kind of blown away. They were so tiny and $7 bucks for 3 dinky little strips. Tiny but good and the BBQ and Ran h sauce were awesome. I'm not sure if they are on house but they were tasty!   I like the restaurant but I think they are way over priced. Not sure if I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The poor reviews kept me away from here. And, well, they were all right. This place is nothing but over-priced, horrible burgers. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because of the niceness of the bar staff.  After an afternoon of shopping, I decided to grab a quick bite - and I was craving a burger. So why not try somewhere new? Ugh. I so should have just gone across the street and gone to Stripburger or even BLT Burger. It wouldn't have cost me as much and I would have been FAR more satisfied.  I was tempted to go with the I Love Bacon burger, but the bad reviews of it led me to choose the Dante burger instead (bleu cheese, carmelized onions, etc.).  Everything is a la carte - so fries or any sides are not included. I wanted to try the fries, but the bartender warned me that the serving size was huge, so I didn't bother.  When the burger arrived, it was...uninteresting. Just a burger on a plate with a side of lettuce and tomato. I ordered it medium, but saw only gray and no pink. And juiciness...forget about it. The bleu cheese was all melty, which can be a good thing, but it just tasted off. The whole thing was just bleh. Really BLEH. I couldn't even finish it, even though I was famished.  And to make things worse, I could start to feel my stomach churning. Immediately after paying my $20+ for just one burger and one beer, I made a serious beeline for the restroom. Ick, ick, ick.  Why pay so much for such an awful burger when such a great bleu cheeseburger can be found almost literally across the street for under $10? And I can get cheese fries and an awesome cocktail with it too, and not spend as much.  Yeah, definitely a place to stay away from."}
{"text":"I went here with a small group of fellow meeting attendees. It looked very promising, but was in the end disappointing. It wasn't busy when we arrived, but it took more than half an hour for our food to arrive. And that was only the fries/onion rings. The burgers didn't show up for yet another half hour. Not once did anyone apologize for the delay or make any sort of accommodation for us.  The fries were ok, though overly salted. The sweet potato fries were soggy as were the onion rings. The burgers were small and nothing to write home about. Definitely not worth the price. I won't be back."}
{"text":"For a quick burger this place hit the spot. I demolished my burger and tater tots and have no complaints.   The service was a bit slow and the restaurant wasn't that crowded - but that's the only complaint."}
{"text":"Such disappointment....  My $25 burger was dry and unseasoned, no flavor.   Service was good but the food really lacks.  Time to hire someone in the kitchen who knows how to not dry out the meat."}
{"text":"Very average.  Not worth the money. The Crispy bacon was limp and the burger lacked flavor. The fries were ok. But overall review is that you won't get sick here from the food but the price will turn your stomach."}
{"text":"This review has two biases: one, I was starving; two, I wasn't footing the bill. Hooray for corporate AMEX.  This burger bar tucked up in the corner of the Palazzo Shops serves up the goods. Overpriced goods, but still... I had a burger with sweet carmelized onions, roasted garlic sauce, and bleu cheese. Ordered medium, it still ran red - nicely seared on the outside and bloody in the middle. My kinda burger.  Skin-on shoestring fries coulda been a little crisper, but with a shake or two of seasoned salt, they did the trick. I ate at the counter/bar - service was quick, attentive, and friendly. In this place, who could ask for more?  Still, a $14 burger's a bit much no matter how much it moos when you bite it. But, for a $14 burger, it was a pretty damn good $14 burger. When you want a beer and some ground beef with the hair singed off it, this is your spot.  Vegas, baby."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. These burgers are legit! It's got a super fun feel to it. Lots of tv's with astroturf around them to make it feel like a real sports bar. The place is pretty busy but that's probably because it's the afc NFC championship weekend. Everything is in fun spirits at the palazzo and everyone is real happy at I love burgers."}
{"text":"What's with the reviews about the cost? If you're on the strip, it's going to be expensive. I enjoyed great service, a terrific waiter who was not pushy & made great suggestions. The garbage fries were perfect to share, the truffled cheese on my waygu Kobe & port wine reduction gravy made for a perfect burger. The spiked vanilla shake was yummilicious & blended nicely with the vanilla vodka.  My husband enjoyed his caprese burger, too! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the burgers here! I had the [heart] & Seoul* and it was so good. They also had $2 beers at the bar. Super friendly staff that makes you feel comfortable. Definitely going back here again."}
{"text":"Just spend about an hour gearing up with excitement for a delicious Caprese burger- my very favorite burger anywhere.  Sadly, upon arrival I found out they've pared down their menu. They took off all the \"pricey\" items because of the more negative yelp reviews. No more Caprese, no sweet potato fries, no tots. Great job, Yelpers! You whined about delicious gourmet burgers costing more than McDonald's and now they've stopped serving almost anything worth getting. (The shakes are still delicious and what selection is left tastes good.) And to I Heart Burgers- you listened to all the negative reviews instead of the positive and now it'll probably cost you. Good job on that."}
{"text":"In town for a busy, crowded work conference. Unfortunately I can't go a whole day without eating, so a friend and I hoofed it over to get a to go order. Ordering to go was confusing, and we had to ask another customer if we were in the right place. The restaurant was crowded and busy, but they had two women acting as hostesses and only two guys behind the bar/counter. After waiting a while with no acknowledgement (not even a wave or \"one moment\" gesture) I started waving to try to get attention. At least to see if we were in the right spot, or should go to the other side of the bar. When the server finally arrived he was PISSED and yelled at me that they were very busy. I told him I was also busy and just wanted an acknowledgment. I told him I had a health issue and needed to eat and that I would tip him 50% if he would just please help us place an order. My friend decided not to order as she was certain this guy was going to spit in our food. While I waited I spoke with the manager, Michael, who was very professional and asked if there was anything else he could help with. After this the server did a total 180 change in his attitude. I was given my order (it really only took about 10 minutes- the kitchen was fast!) but thankfully I checked before running back to a meeting because they gave me the wrong thing (salad instead of sandwich and fries). I understand those guys are working really hard, so I kept my word and tipped $10 on a $20 carry out order. The sweet potato fries were very tasty and the sandwich was good. This is a decent diner type place, and it's too bad my first impression was so negative."}
{"text":"Had the Dante burger (bleu cheese and caramelized onions) on a wheat bun. The burger was very good and cooked to order, but the shoestring fries suck. They're thinner than my shoelaces - more grease than potato.  The burger would get 4 stars if it was less expensive."}
{"text":"Decent burger, but nothing to write home about. Atmosphere is fun and the service was really good. Combo of good service and standard burger = three stars.  The bar for burgerz iz high. I'M FROM FREAKIN' NOO YAWK WHERE THE BURGACIOUSNESS IS PROLIFIC, n' stuph.  This doesn't touch Burger Joint, Shake Shack, or any of the awesome burger places in my city."}
{"text":"I would rate lower BUT the service was fabulous. I rated on the lower side because the food is way over priced for the taste.  We ordered a regular cheeseburger, fries , and shake. Came to about $15 something. I'm cool with that IF the food was fabulous, unfortunately it's not. The fries were a bit under cooked. And the burger just tasted like a normal beef, without hardly any flavor to it. All the ingredients are fresh. A Plus but Portions a bit small for the price. The shake was good (but how can you go wrong with ice cream lol). If I came back I would just try a new flavor shake. But no food. Save my other $10 for a movie instead hahaha. (Which is next door)"}
{"text":"As far as these more \"quick\" dining restaurants go - this one has the best burgers. I like them much more than Carl's Jr., and Smashburger. I got the BBQ burger which was SO very good. The buns they use are fresh and have a hint of sweetness to them, similar to a hawaiian roll, great smokey bbq sauce, tasty bacon and my burger was cooked perfectly medium. The fries are very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - perfect. I will certainly go back next time I am in the mood for a burger and I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Our group of friends, vacationing to Las Vegas, went to this place because we wanted to find a dinner place that wasn't quite one of those places of $65+ a head, nor one of the overpriced \"cheap\" mediocre places, nor one of the chain places (like Chipotle or Panda) on the strip, and we were staying in the Palazzo.   To start with, it took the waitress like 10-15 minutes to even get to us to take the drink order. The drinks were brought to us by a different person, so it was another 10-15 before we could even make our order.   One of the people in our group ordered a chocolate shake which was brought to us so long after it was made that it was half-melted. Some of the food brought to us had also started to cool down, and they seemed to ignore my friend's order of \"no cheese\" on his burger.   Also, one of the ways I judge service at a place is by seeing if I get to the point where it took them so long to replace my water that I need to start chewing on the ice. Like 20 minutes after I got to this point, the hostess (the one who seats you) and not the waitress finally came and refilled our waters.   The burgers were, precisely as a different reviewer wrote, average. They're better than many fast food places, but not the quality I'd expect from a place that charges $12-25 for just a burger entree. Honestly, the food is one of the few things saving this place from a one star review. I am, in fact, quite full after eating there, and I did pay a relatively cheap fare for Vegas Strip food.   Warning! The Parmesan Garlic fries are actually just their fries with Parmesan flakes and garlic sprinkled over them. I expected something nice, akin to the Counter in CA, where there is high quality cheese melted on and I eat them with pleasure every time. That's not what these are.   To put a nice bow on the whole deal, the waitress took the 20% coupon we had from the book that came with our room and failed to ring it up at first, thus causing the person carding the bill to need to go void the transaction and have them re-ring it up.   I only wish we had actually checked Yelp, since our experience seems to match others' very well."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. It runined my vacation. I spent 2 days in my room at the palazzo throwing up, my 3 year old also got sick. I told the hotel staff and then called I love burgers to let them know. I got a half ass apology from the manager.  There corporate office returned my call a few days later and applogized.. That was all, weekeend in vegas ruined, not even a refund for my meal.  Thanks I Love Burgers..."}
{"text":"This place has such bad reviews, and I think that's unfair. Perhaps its first days getting off the ground were not pretty, but I didn't experience any of the problems people mention like mixed up orders or under/over-cooked meat.  Comparing it to Burger Bar at Mandalay Place, I prefer Burger Bar, which has a better, sleeker vibe in my opinion. Their menu is also bigger and execution is more on point. But I think I Love Burgers is on the right track. I opted for the regular burger with ground up bacon inside the meat, and the mac 'n cheese fries. I was really satisfied. The oreo shake was even better. My husband also enjoyed his buffalo burger.  Honestly, the only ridiculous thing about this place is the price. I know it is Vegas and I know it is the Palazzo...but it needs to LOOK the part to charge those prices. It should not look like a diner."}
{"text":"Right of the bat staff was super friendly. We were Seated almost immediately. As I was checking in I was about to redeem the check in special when I turned around our server was already on it! Nice! My burger was cooked to perfection (medium-rare) kids cleaned their plates (rare for my kiddos) a lil unconventional with the whole burgers w/ no fries. which adds to \"a bit on the pricey side\"  not once did I think it was dirty nor poor service. quite the opposite. I was expecting attitude because of the setting in the upscale trendy palazzo hotel. but I was met with a cheerful and casual setting.   in short try it out its still a great burger even if it doesn't come a accompanied w/ fries....:-("}
{"text":"No complaints here! Phenomenal service and attention from waiter to manager. Had coffee with our burgers, the Seoul and the Dante (no bleu cheesy for me!) had the garbage trash fries (spicey surprise but delicious and amazing flavor a combined!), also had the sweet potato fries which were perfect crisp(seasoned w cinnamon!) recommended !!!!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing at the bar to have lunch. Very pleasant and cheerful staff who were also attentive. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night with amazing burgers with excellent service!  They offer 25% off breakfast this morning, plentiful food, extremely continued excellent service and the food was fantastic!! Wish we had discovered this place for breakfast the first day we were here!!"}
{"text":"I don't looove burgers, but this place is pretty damn good. It's not exactly the burgers that I remember though. They were good, yes, but there are good burgers everywhere.  It's the milkshakes. I think my bf and I got a blueberry pancake (?) and caramel corn. They both literally taste like blueberry pancake and caramel corn in milkshake form. I was like wtf, how do they do that? It's not a gross kind of way where you imagine throwing milk, ice cream, and pieces of caramel corn and pancake in a blender and serve that. Or maybe that's exactly how they do it. I dunno, but those milkshakes were awesome."}
{"text":"I had the leghorn(chicken breast) and it was pretty good. My hubby had the standard and he enjoyed it also. We both enjoyed the gourmet buns....thought it brought the burgers up a notch. The service was fast and friendly. For a burger joint our meal was a bit pricey...but hey this is Vegas and a meal for two under thirty bucks is kinda a bargain."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would. $25 kobe burger was horrible. $15 slush drinks ..aful as well. Only bright spot was Erik our server.doubt I will get home without getting sick. This local WONT ever be back.. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Free mac and cheese if you check in! but it's not that good.. the burgers were alright. nothing special, esp not for that price.  garlic and parmesan fries are literally just fries with garlic and parmasan flakes on top. in and out's fries are better.. and it's about 10x cheaper.  service was good though, so i guess that's a plus."}
{"text":"I saw the yelp reviews before I went yet I decided to try this place out anyway since I have two children and there was not much for them in the immediate area.  The food is extremely overpriced to say the least!  The food was not even that good either, I don't think I would go even if the prices were cut in half.  The burger meat did not stand out at all and it was like $15 for an a la carte burger.  The shakes were ok but sounded way better than they tasted.  Service was just ok.  Needless to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I rarely write a poor review, but what a disappointment. We checked into the Palazzo early and wanted to grab something to eat while we waited for our room to be ready. The girl at the front desk said the I love Burgers was now serving breakfast, so we headed on over.   The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full. Not at all crowded with many empty tables, but for some reason it took them 10 minuts to find a table for our party of 4. We should have left then, but we were all tired from early am flights and we just wanted to sit down. After another 10 minute wait, this time to order, the waitress showed up. Two of us ordered coffee and the other 2 ordered $10 bloody marys. They were curious to see what a $10 bloody mary loohed like. In the description there was a promise of a piece of applewood smoked bacon in the glass. We tried to order our food at the same time, but it turns out the drinks waitress cannot take the food order, so that meant another 5 minutes waiting for the food waitress. We all ordered food and then sat for 20 minutes with neither food or drink. Incredibly, our food came before our drinks arrived. The food was ok. My husband ordered an egg white omlet and was served what was clearly not an egg white omlet, but otherwise our order was correct. I was splitting an oder of the breakfast sliders with the or woman in our party. They were good, though not warm. I suspect they were prepared for the group sitting behind us who walked out before the food came. Our drinks were finally served 10 minutes later. The two bloody marys did not come close to justifying $10 a piece. It was just bloody mary mix poured over ice- no garnishes. My husband walked over to the waitress to point out that the bacon was missing. Instead of taking the drinks away and fixing them, she brought over a plate with 2 pieces of bacon on it. She also commented that she didn't bring the olives that should have come in them and asked if we wanted them. My husband declined, but the woman in our group that ordered the drink said that she would like the olives. She got a death stare from the waitress and the olives never came.   I can report that they were fast with one part of their service - the check came out within a few minutes of the food, in fact, before we were even done eating. This restaurant has a long way to go. If you are located in a Las Vegas hotel, I don't think there is ever an excuse for poor service. By the time you open up a business on the Strip, you should have all parts of your business pulled together and working correctly. AllI can say is I HATE \"I Love Burgers.\""}
{"text":"Good late night eat at the Shoppes in Palazzo (2nd floor).   They have a wide choice of beers including some of me & my bf's faves (Lindeman's Raspberry Framboise and Chimay Blue Ale)! Yes, I like fruity girly beers. Don't hate.  For a place called \"I Love Burgers,\" you would think we would order burgers but we wanted something a little lighter so we got the chicken strips and parmesan garlic fries. The portions were surprisingly huge! And the chicken strips and fries tasted great! I didn't like the aioli that came with the fries though. It was a little too heavy (\"neukki\" in Korean) for me.   I hear their spiked milkshakes are also delicious! You can get them super spiked for an extra charge!"}
{"text":"Really loving this place ! Ive been here a few times the food always tastes super fresh and has a home made feel to it. If your a burger lover this place is a must! Meat is nice, tender & juicy! French fries are perfect, not to salty and they taste super natural not like that fast food crap. Me and my bf also ordered the strawberry milk shake it was kinda thick which wasnt an issue for me, it cane with a spoon! Very flavorful i do recommend it! Wasnt to hot for the fried pickles, they were okay. Love the chill vibe here, good for couples or larger groups. They also have outside seating and a little bar."}
{"text":"Go for the burger but skip it and just get a boozy milkshake and some fries. I had some sort of fruity (I think it was blueberry) boozy shake and it was unreal tasty!  Super crazy filling though.  I barely had room for a few of my overcooked sliders.  The sliders were meh but the bun was really really good.  We also ordered the mac n cheese bites and they were totally disappointing.  I think they needed to cook them longer.   The milkshake's goodness made up for the meals shortcomings but it was definitely a lesson learned."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Palazzo and wanted a bite to eat for Breakfast, so we stumbled upon I Love Burgers inside the Restaurant Row that is shared by The Palazzo and its sister property, The Venetian.  I will preface this review by saying that we probably didn't come to this establishment for the right type of meal -- I say that because the name obviously implies Burgers, so right off the bat, you should know it's not likely a good place for breakfast. Yes, they do have a breakfast menu, but it's not their specialty. Either way it goes, it was off the beaten path, we were hungry, and stumbled upon it, and thus, here is the review.  It was around 9am and we wanted to put something in our stomachs prior to getting our day started, and while the Grand Lux Cafe is always available, we wanted something different.   The breakfast menu isn't extensive, and is but half a page long. Again, understandable, as this place isn't geared towards the morning crowd, but cool of them to offer breakfast being in the Palazzo enclave.  The place is very unassuming in the early hours of the day, with barely a patron in sight. They seem like they have far too much of waiter staff, and not enough cooks. On the one morning I went with my parents (they kept going back LOL), there were only 3 other patrons in the establishment, yet it took them forever to push orders out. They had like 5 waiters and what appeared like 1 cook.   I'm going to assume that since it was a holiday weekend (4th of July), that the manager booked extra waiters, expecting more traffic through the early hours of the day. Such wasn't the case.  On this particular morning, nothing on their breakfast menu looked enticing, but being that we were already in there, I figured to go with a sausage burrito and OJ. I ordered my burrito dry -- Sorry, I don't like sour cream and cheese/salsa all over a burrito for breakfast. Someone else in our party had an order of 2 eggs sunny side up and two others had omelets and the other had the 'On the Border' skillet.   It took them exactly 24 minutes to cook my breakfast burrito, only for them to get it wrong (they flooded my burrito with the sour cream and salsa, when I specifically said I wanted it dry). Fortunately, it took them only 5 minutes more (Half hour total) to bring out a new one. To me, the burrito was super bland. The eggs had no taste, the sausage was without flavoring, the cheese was the only thing holding this thing together as far as a decent breakfast. I knew after the first bite that I had made a mistake coming to this place for breakfast.  Others in our party were pleased with their breakfast, and they kept coming back to this place the rest of our stay, me, not so much. One thing that is cool is, if you keep your receipt and come back the next day, they give you 25% off your order -- These folks I was with kept coming every day for breakfast, and by the 3rd day they didn't need a receipt anymore, as the morning staff recognized them and kept giving them 25% off their orders the rest of the stay.  I personally wouldn't come back to this place, unless it was the only option available again."}
{"text":"This burger joint is not your average fast food burger place! With a variety of shakes and menu items that will knock your socks off! Very modern feel and vibe, its great for families too. The food tastes fresh and the prices are about resturaunt prices and qualities, that is what sets this place apart from most fast food joints. Team members are friendly and food is ready fairly quick. Great for times when you are in a rush but still want a tasty quality meal. OH and if your a Mac & Cheese LOVER you MUST try their fried Mac & Cheese squares with their delicous dipping sauce, trust me."}
{"text":"When the line for the breakfast place in the hotel was too long I wandered into the Grand Canal Shoppes and found I Love Burgers after recognizing their sign from the elevator. A man (appeared to be the manager) hustled to greet me and grab me a menu and my drink order as I sat down.  He was polite and quick and apologized when my food took a little bit longer than expected due to a large ticket in front of me.  Little did he know I could still be waiting in line at the other place. The food was great, the restaurant immaculate and you can tell the people working there genuinely enjoy their job.  It felt like a small-town diner but I was in the middle of the Vegas Strip...not easy to pull that off. Bottom Line: $27 with tip for a very ample breakfast that I am currently digesting.  A note to all the previous reviewers complaining about the prices ... please remember you are in Las Vegas, they must have very high rent and overhead. The quality of the food and service makes up for the prices and I enjoyed every minute of this place.  Well done."}
{"text":"I had the Dante (yum) and split an order of sweet potato fries upon the server's recommendation. My dinner companion had a hairline crack in his beer glass, for which our server apologized profusely, and it was promptly replaced. No biggie - stuff happens. The food came out very fast! I'm surprised others would complain about the price, given that it is in a (relatively nice) hotel on the Strip. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Ok I have walked by this place hundreds of times and never got to try it out so finally I went last night.  The atmosphere was more casual than expected, more like a premium fast food on the lines of a burger version of Chipotle than an actual restaurant. I ordered the Inferno and truffle fries. The burger came in an egg bun with roasted jalapenos. It's on the level of The Counter or another specialty burger place and the fries were good too. I'd certainly come back for one on the rare occasions that I crave a burger. My biggest complaint is that they don't offer any craft beer. Whoever owns that place is asleep at the wheel for not offering a fine craft IPA to accompany the food."}
{"text":"Great food, great employees! Tanya the bartender is amazing at her craft and fun to boot! Birthday daiquiri machine shots are awesome!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and I must say, this place is great!  I had a bacon burger and blueberry milkshake. The service was fast, friendly and clearly has great management. I will be back to eat again! Thanks, Pb from Boston"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here after not deciding to eat at other places we passed on the way to here. That was a bad decision and I will explain why.  The service was not what we expected to be \"Vegas Caliber\". Instead, I believe we were served based on our appearance. I walked in there in really plain clothes, and haven't showered yet since I was so hungry getting off of our flight. I asked what the popular choice was, and she gave me \"the look\", \"the eyeroll\", and then \"the sigh\" before she replied in a tone where answering my request was going to take another important minute away from her life. After we had ordered, I had hoped the food would be better than the service. Wrong. The food was the same as something you would expect from Burger King. I think we would have gotten better service there as well. I will not give them one star for although my experience there was not great, the food was not sloppy, looked halfway decent, and the place was clean; cleaner than Burger King... Unfortunately, I will never return to that place for I had learned my lesson: you get what you pay for; meaning the service should equal how much you pay for the meal. All for yelp and yelp for all!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour appetizer and drink specials! Half off apps and great drink specials during happy hour but unfortunately my burger was raw when I asked for med rare. I didn't send it back as I almost never do but I really should've in this case. I will give this place another try because I think this may have just been a slip up. The presentation was good as were the drinks as you can see in the pics so I'd still say give them a try"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers,  Sean or bartender makes an amazing margarita!!  Definitely recommend. Happy hour is excellent!!"}
{"text":"I was looking to grab a quick bite when working a trade show at the Sands Convention Center. Usually I visit the \"food court\" but this time I wanted something that offered a bit more flavor.   This place served both needs - it got me and out (within 30 minutes) and served me up one good burger with some tatter tots on the side  Of course on my way out I got the triple dark chocolate shake which definitely helped me get through the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I am the kind of person who has to talk everything over.  Came in by myself and the manager was more than happy to discuss the menu items with me.  Was looking for something delicious but somewhat healthy, and decided on the black bean veggie burger. Absolutely amazing! Has alfalfa sprouts, shredded iceberg, tomato, caramelized onions, and a smokey roasted pepper sauce on a whole wheat bun. All ingredients compliment each other beautifully.  If this was not my last day here in Vegas, would be back to try other items on the menu.  Only gave 4 stars because I only had one item, but I am sure the rest of the menu is great!"}
{"text":"Big Boy Hungry    You might think That the brand name I Love Burgers Would be enough to say what needs to be said But if you do visit this location Ask if Carl is flipping burgers My man is a wizard on the grill  Ordered the I Love Bacon Burger But with Colorado Burger patty With garlic aioli as instead of the maple  WOW"}
{"text":"I love Burgers is located on the second floor of the Palazzo Hotel close to the suite elevators. This is the perfect alternative to room service as it is quick and easy to get to. The actual restaurant is clean with a lot of TV's if you would like to watch a game while you eat. I ordered to go and took my very large cheeseburger and fries back up to my room. The fry order was huge so definitly share. The burger was delicious. The cost for this burger and fries was about $20. This place isn't cheap but it is cheaper and quicker than room service."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to eat here b/c it was in the hotel we were staying at (The Palazzo).  The restaurant was well lit w/ cute decorations.  The place was clean and the servers were nice and attentive.    For appetizers, we had the nom nom bites and the garlic Parmesan fries. The nom nom bites were just tiny mac and cheese bites.  Not bad, but nothing great.  It was a little bland and you couldn't really taste the cheese.  The garlic Parmesan fries were not good.  It was covered in Parmesan and I couldn't even taste the fries or the garlic.    I shared the I heart bacon burger and the pork sliders.  The bacon burger supposedly had bacon in it but I couldn't taste the bacon in the burger.  There were bacon pieces and onion straws on top.  The onion straws added a nice crunch to the burger.  The burger itself was tender and not dry.  The pork sliders were do it yourself sliders.  The meat was very tender and had a lot of flavors and went well w/ the brioche buns.    For dessert, our group shared the bread pudding and the creme brulee.  The bread pudding was ok, a little dry.  The creme brulee was just ok.  I've had better.    Overall, not a bad place for a burger."}
{"text":"I had a to pick up a suit next door and thought i'd grab a burger while I was waiting for the suit to be altered.  I went in around 6 on a Tuesday and it was pretty empty and I took a seat at the bar and the girls were really nice.  I ordered a bacon burger and a side salad, the salad was very plain and the burger was over cooked and the bun was cold.  The kicker was the bill was over $27 out the door with tip and I had only water to drink.  I def would not go back and would rather go to Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay or even grab a burger at Grand Lux Cafe before heading back to this place."}
{"text":"Nom Noms (fried mac & cheese) were tasty.  Bacon Burger was nice and bacon-y, though we ordered it medium well and it was still really pink in the middle.  If you order it rare, they probably will present you with a live cow.  Just a heads up.  Fries (both parmesan garlic and sweet potato) were ok.  I've definitely had better.  Blueberry Panshake was YUMMY.  Tasted just like a blended-up blueberry pancake, only not disgusting. :-P  Service was quick (maybe cuz the restaurant was dead), but the waiter was suuuuper rude and unfriendly.  Maybe it's because we shared two burgers, two fries, and an order of Nom Noms between the four of us, but is it really our fault that we weren't all that hungry (and that the food here is pretty overpriced)?!?!  Ditch the unfriendly employees and my rating would probably go up."}
{"text":"Alas, the catty title writes itself: I *don't* love (these) burgers.  Despite a friendly staff (albeit three tries at the cashier to get our order right), the savvy shown by offering a sit-down, waiter-free, casual dining experience with a customizable burger menu at Town Square (right by the movies!) does not extend to the prowess in the kitchen.  I was really excited to try the vegetarian burger because it's a black bean patty made in-house, not some nuked Boca disc. Unfortunately, the patty not only started squooshing beyond containment at first bite, but it severely lacked flavour. I'm used to dealing with squishy vegetarian patties that require hand gymnastics to keep them in the bun (LBS, Burger Bar), but usually the taste redeems the annoying acrobatics. Here, the taste was just sludgy.   It's not a good thing when, with every bite, you have to wipe (and wipe) a wall of paste off your front teeth.  Maybe the burger would've been better if it'd been served as advertised, with alfalfa sprouts on top, but I doubt it. I'd added Swiss cheese to my order, and normally cheese will distract me from many taste issues, but not this time. Thank goodness for the serve-yourself condiment bar. There I got mayonnaise packets to add the tang I'd been expecting from the burger's red pepper sauce. (In addition to mayo, the condiment bar has pumps-and-cups for ketchup and mustard plus packets of Tabasco sauce.)  My chosen beverage was the triple chocolate shake. I didn't say anything as I drank it (and drink it I did, because I was thirsty and didn't want to pay $3 for bottled water in addition to this $6 concoction), but when I coaxed my husband into taking a sip, his first thought was the same as mine. \"Is this just ice cream? Slightly melted ice cream?\" \"Yeah, I think it is. With a big, scratchy drizzle of chocolate syrup.\" I couldn't taste where it had ever been near a blender.  My tator tots were okay, about what I'd expect from a frozen Ore-Ida bag at home.  My husband was even less than impressed with his Inferno burger (although it was definitely hot) and onion rings. The taste just wasn't there, not even with the first few hunger-sating bites.  We were both sad that we'd wasted a meal out on I Love Burgers, but it seemed like such a good concept, like a more hip Fuddruckers. For just a little more money, we could have crossed the sidewalk and enjoyed something at Yard House. Despite not having eaten all day, I left half of my burger on my plate, and my husband left with regret that he didn't do the same."}
{"text":"I went here and ordered the barbiq burger and i got the meat in medium well. I had to admit it was really good. Although the fries got in the way, it was salty and i had to dip the fries with mayo and ketchup. All and all I would give the fries 3.5 out of 5. The service of the burger was right on time. I like the look of the restaurant with the fun and relaxed look of the burger joint. Worth the visit especially if you just want to try a good burger!"}
{"text":"Worse service and food took over 20 minutes and when ask manager about how much longer she seemed like she was being bothered will not return for this kind of service and spending over 50.00   Stay away"}
{"text":"My friends and I had lunch here last weekend and I was not overly impressed with the place. I am a fan of a good burger and actually enjoy making my own from scratch so I'm always curious as to these burger restaurants and how they compare against my own and other establishments. I Love Burgers is ok but I probably wouldn't frequent the restaurant. The ordering process was easy with variety of burgers to choose from. You can pick between 1/3 pound patty or a 1/2 pound patty (more to love) for $1 more. I chose the Inferno Burger more to love (1/2 pound patty, with pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, and a spicy mayo). The combo was $4 more (and it came with your choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries, or tator tots and a drink). I chose the tator tots.   The burger itself was jiucy and pretty tasty. However, it was overpowered by the amount of jalapenos that were added on to the burger. I didn't feel like it was that large of a burger for the price that I paid ($7.99) and for the price of the combo meal, left a little bit unsatisfied. The tator tot side is a nice touch and option instead of fries.  For the price, I definitely feel like I can have more food elsewhere or get a better quality burger for the price at another place (like Bachi Burger)."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place, but they hassled me about my service dog, so we left. Their loss"}
{"text":"First time trying this place! Friendly staff and ok  food. Only thing is we order the burger well done and when they served it was still red :-( !!! Maybe will coming again"}
{"text":"The buns of the burgers where cold, burger had no taste. The fries tasted like crap. The lady in the front got my sisters order wrong. You are better off going to McDonalds"}
{"text":"Only a real yelper would know to give this place the stars it really deserves.  I'm fortunate to live in the San Francisco Bay Area where my tastebuds are tastebud happy! That being said, I know a good burger when I taste one.  I Love Burgers was a huuuuuuuuuge fail, huuuuuuuuge!  Even the macaroni and cheese bites were a fail.  It's not that hard to make a burger and ok maybe it is hard to fry macaroni and cheese bites but if you are going to advertize it all around the Palazzo it better be damn good.  Well  unfortunately, mine tasted burnt!  How the hell do you F up mac n' cheese???  I Love Burgers--you should have stuck to the boxed mac n' cheese, seriously!!!!  The burgers reminded me of your neigborhood chain frozen patties between a bun (which btw, the bun was the only good thing).  The sweet potato fries were just meh, same old....nothing to special but it was decent.    For the price we paid to eat here....it was a disappointment to my LV trip.  To top it off, the waiters/waitresses appeared to not have a handle on the crowd.  We had to ask for our condiments and extras at least 2 times, we asked for water numerous times.  The usual response was, \"oh man sorry I forgot.\"    *sigh* Annnd, when our party requested for a bill split, they couldn't get it right.  He had asked us to number #1, #2 and #3 for the split and so we clearly did it........one thing went bill #1 when it was supposed to be on bill #3, the other on bill #3 supposedly on bill #1.  Ahhhhhhhh.....get it right.  Oh and the hostess...stared at our party the whole time.  As we walked out, my friend complained about how the bill part was a mess and alll they could say to us was sorry it was a computer glitch.    Oh yeeeeeeeeah, be ready to pay for ranch dressing.  50 cents extra!  What the heeeeze?  You're higher class counterparts don't even charge for that stuff.  The next time I come back to LV (which will probably be next year), I'm hoping this place will be gone.  Please, stayyyyyyy away....I would've rather ate at McDonalds or have a salty Pinks hotdog, sheeeeeeeeeeze!"}
{"text":"this is the review of the soft opening.  I had the privilege of speaking with the Manager today and I am excited with what he had to say.  more and more delicious goodness to be had with an expansion to the menu.    i rolled through with my boys from work and we destroyed the place.  a few of us  got the I love bacon burgers... I am pretty sure I felt my heart jump while eating it.  My friend had the turkey burger and my other friend got the caprese burger....     The bacon burger is complete with pieces of bacon inside, bacon grease infused mayo, bacon on the burger....  man, I love bacon.  haha.    the turkey burger looked great and my friend told me that it was fantastic.  The caprese burger also was reported as the same.     We did split the appetizers, mac and cheese nom noms, (deep fried amc and cheese bites with cheese dipping sauce)  DELICIOUS!!   we also had the Bruschetta... this was very good, nice chunks of red and green tomatoes.    the service (which you all know is important to me after reading my other reviews) was outstanding.  Everyone was nice and very attentive... my soda never got down to the bottom where it makes that god awful noise of slurping.  I think this place shows some serious promise.  go get some burgers already.."}
{"text":"Bit of a rough start but redeem themselves. Happy with their service and food quality. I'm glad they rushed the order since my daughter was on her break. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Vegas. I come here once a year for a trade show and think about this places breakfast burritos. Love it. I'm here right now, was here for dinner last night, and lunch yesterday. Try it if you like beer and good burgers."}
{"text":"I really like the whole chalk board walls.  I've wanted to do the same to one of my walls at home for awhile.  You can draw and write all over the walls while killing some time and waiting for your food to come out.  They also wrote their menu on it.  Just watch out when you're walking around because you might forget about the chalk, bump into the wall, and get chalk all over your clothes. LOL I didn't bump into the wall but someone else did and of course I told um about it, not right away.  Their kitchen is open so we get to watch as they create our burgers, apps, and shakes.  They also have an outside dinning area.  I came here with a free standard burger coupon, a quick lunch.  It was free so it was pretty good but had I paid, it probably wasn't worth it.  I've had nicer burgers with good fries for the same price in nice restaurants. This was the \"standard\" plain burger just a burger with cheese, lettuce, and tomato in a bun. Their other burger options on the menu seems tasty.  There really wasn't any customer service.  There was a cashier, you order and pay when you come in, and the person who brings your food, that's it. Self serve soda and condiments.  I'll probably be back since I only tried the standard burger and haven't fully experienced I Love Burgers.  Plus it's in a good location near yard house, blue martini, and rave theater. Maybe I'll try the triple chocolate shake or some desserts, the menu online says there's creme brulee and bread pudding, always fan of those. There's parmesan garlic fries, not a fan regular cut fries anymore so I have to see if they can give me parmesan garlic steak fries instead.  Noticed that they have free meal upgrades on Thursday, happy hour specials, and a good selection of my favorite beers which are always nice to see."}
{"text":"Where to start..   My first time coming here and I adore this place! I ordered an I Love bacon burger with a side of truffle fries. It's a tad pricier than other burger joints.. But it's so worth it!! Great taste, and such good quality of the food.   Now... Onto drinks. We went on over to the bar area that's located near the balcony seating. Our bartender was Aaron.. What a rockstar! He suggested great drinks to me and my boyfriend with us just mentioning what kind of liquor we prefer. I mentioned that I like whisky/ dark liquor, so he made me a Pain Killer.. And wow the taste was great! Very smooth drink, but definitely creeps up on you  my BF ordered a melon ball & a Collins. Both great also!! I definitely recommend going to try this out & forsure ask for Aaron at the bar! He had a great attitude with funny stories to keep the good times going. Definitely will be returning when I visit Vegas again (California resident). I recommend!  OH and Sunday's they have BOGO bloody Marys / or mimosas"}
{"text":"So I yelped the place I had a feeling that it was gonna be horrible. So I didn't really expect much, actually I was having second thoughts of even eating here. But don't let the reviews fool you, it's not that bad.  I ordered the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and a strawberry milkshake. I wasn't going to make my order a combo but I really wanted a milkshake so they told me that I could just make my burger a combo and makes my drink a milkshake and the fries were basically free, so why not. Okay, SO I really did love the burger but the downside is that it wasn't as big as I thought it would be for what $6 bucks? And the fries weren't huge or anything it was just a little serving, keep in mind that a side of fries are 2.50. Their sweet potato fries weren't the best, they added cinnamon or something to them and it made them taste kind of weird, yeah not a fan. The best part was seriously the milkshake!! I absolutely love strawberry and when it came it was topped with marshmallows, I LOVE MARSHMALLOWS!! My boyfriend got The Inferno burger which I took a bite of and it was amazing! I liked it better than mine actually. It was a perfect spicy burger. If you like jalapeños, go for the Inferno. He got the natural cut fries which were awesome, perfect crunch!  The place isn't as bad as I thought it would be. But I'd like it better if it was a sit down restaurant, because the prices are more of a sit down restaurant. It's not a cheap place to get food, it's not fast food. But overall, the taste of the place is awesome."}
{"text":"I love a good burger but this place is a huge disappointment. Your easily spending $25 for a burger, fries, and one drink. For that price I would expect a burger that would knock my socks off."}
{"text":"I must say, huge location, but such RANDOM DECOR!!! I came here when I made a trip to Las Vegas with some friends. I got the Plymouth burger and sweet potato fries. The taste of the burger was alright, but it was extremely messy. The patty was too thin that it broke into pieces before I even got to take a bite out of it! The sweet potato fries were good, it seemed really fresh and had cinnamon sprinkled over them (YUM!).   I have to say the service pretty much sucked though and it is pretty expensive (for being such an informal place)! At the beginning, our server was good and attended to us. However, there would be long spurts of time where she would not come to our table. What was she doing in that time? Well I saw her and she was joking around with her co-workers, they were hugging and laughing louder than everyone in the restaurant combined. That is not good service!! I don't go to Vegas often, but when I do go back, I probably won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I actually in fact LOVE, I love burgers. This location is convenient to park. I love their Bison meat or even their turkey meat, I have never had the beef but I'm sure it's good.  I order the inferno, add avocado. Warning the peppers are HOT as hell, and I can handle heat, sometimes it's intense. Yum town"}
{"text":"We came here because we were too lazy to leave our hotel. It's located in the Palazzo. I got the I love bacon and it was okay. The bacon was really overpowering and dripping with oil but I guess I should've expected that. My mom got the kale salad with salmon which I actually thought was better. My mom kept racing about it all night. Not bad place if you're looking for a burger joint that is convenient."}
{"text":"First off, do not come if you are in a hurry.   Kitchen staff seems discontent and bored.  Natural cut fries.  Not really sure what that means.  They are machine cut and flavorless.  If they aren't frozen they have done an excellent job of recreating that experience.  So onto the burger.  The shiny bun reminded me of in n out but it turns out to be more dense and kind of heavy.  The burger is cooked to order ...  As long as you would order med well.  Unfortunately I am a med rare guy.  I am a minimalist with toppings so I chose American cheese and a squirt of ketchup.  The burger is lightly salted and heavily peppered and very average.     Overall this place is very average.  If you are stuck its ok. But there are many better burgers to be had in Vegas."}
{"text":"We split the Heart and Seoul burger and our friend had the sliders. Both were good. They aren't on the menu, but get the parmesan garlic tator tots, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"the food here is pretty good but the service was not good at all. the server didnt card anyone, no smiles or any type of friendlyness and gave you an attitude as if she just wanted everyone to eat and leave."}
{"text":"On my first visit I came here for a business meet-up. My bf and I didn't plan to eat here so we just had a bloody Mary. It was so delicious. Strong and spicy with A crispy piece of bacon. I thought about that Bloody Mary all day. I Love Burgers is located in Town Square. Perfect location for all the busy shoppers.  We decided we wanted to eat here and came back a couple days later. My bf ordered the bbq  burger. He enjoyed it very much, the burger was moist and he also enjoyed the egg on his burger. He also thought the bun is a good choice for the burger. Very soft. I wanted to Oregon Trail burger (bison) but they were out. We got into a conversation with the bartender and she further explained they just got the shipment but the burgers were frozen. So I decided on the heart & Seoul. I ordered kimchi on the side (glad I did) and also the wasabi mayo on the side. I did enjoy a touch of the wasabi mayo on my burger. Overall a good burger. The meat was cooked well and my egg over hard like I asked for it. My bf and I shared the truffle fries and they were delicious, nice and crispy and well seasoned.   They have a full bar, we had our lunch at the bar. They also have a great happy hour and Sunday drink specials. BOGO drinks all day Sunday. A nice treat was the chillers. Even better is there is no sugar added. We also chose to add a shot. Yum. I hear the shakes are great and you can also order a spiked shake!  What surprises me about this place is both times we were there the place was not very busy. Outside seating available and also a kids room. I will be back to I Love Burgers next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Wife paid for plain hamburger for are son, never stated their was a kid menu. Well hamburger didn't come plain. Female hostess rolled her eyes with attitude. Manager was really nice and gave a is a plain hamburger with fries!"}
{"text":"Good burger, good shake and great French fries.  The biggest problem is the price.  I feel that this place is way over priced for what you get.  The food was very good, but it was not earth shattering.  For two people- two burgers, 2 shakes and a serving of fries the total was in the fifties! For lunch that is pretty crazy.    If you can find a coupon or split a burger with someone it is totally worth it! Make sure you get the fries!!"}
{"text":"great burgers! must try the i love bacon burger and the mac n cheese nom nom's!!!"}
{"text":"Not long after posting my review, I was contacted by their Director of Marketing & Community Relations apologizing for my less than excellent experience. She was incredibly sweet and accommodating. My gripes about my experience there still stand, but I commend them for taking my criticisms and addressing them with me in an appropriate and appreciative manner. Hopefully, they'll still take my to-go cup gripe to heart."}
{"text":"Never brought the fries we ordered,  waitress finally showed up after we had finished our burgers to ask how everything was, told her we never received our order, had to ask for them removed from bill. No offer for dessert not even an apology for the mess up"}
{"text":"If you want to spend a ton of money on very mediocre food and service, this is where you want to go. Portions are tiny - $17 for a BURGER? Really?? The only thing that you will be filled with after coming here is regret.  There's really no reason to come here when Grand Lux is right downstairs with better prices and far superior food."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! You would think it would be excellent especially since it's in Vegas. But nope...it's not. So sad since I truly love burgers and fries. But they ruined everything. Let me tell you about my experience.   Parking was fine since it was in a hotel. Either self park or valet (free). Place was located in the Palazzo...kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the hotel. Anyways, we were seated right away which was a plus! The thing was, I swear...our waitress was on coke or something. She kept mumbling weird statements which i did not understand and she just talked too fast for me. Shocking since Im from New York and we're known for talking really fast. But anyways, drinks came out ok. But the food...WTF?!?!? It was a 45 minute wait!!! I was with 2 of my uncles and they got burgers and I got a drilled chicken burger! It does not take 45 minutes to grill a damn piece of chicken!!!! And the food came out messed up (except for mine :-D). One of my uncles' burgers was cooked way to well done. It was basically cooked to a charcoal. My other uncle's burger had mayo on it when he said no mayo and didn't have tomatoes when he asked for tomatoes. WTF?!?!? Oh yea, my chicken was cold. We were told that the fries would be beefy, but no...they were super thin...like chips. Total disappointment. You know what really bugged the crap out of me.....fries didn't come with the meal?!?!??! WOAH! Crazy...and the fries (more like chips) sucked big time. Burgers were totally overpriced. I got the gilled chicken burger which was $10 but since i wanted avocados with it, it was an extra $2. Wackness....I will never recommend this place to anyone. I actually warn you people not to go there. Oh yea, one of my uncles got a milkshake. It was weak...Friendlys is so much better and you get more at Friendlys with a better price. I hated my burger at I Love Burgers. Hope you don't end up the same way.  Oh woops, I forgot....at least their mozzarella sticks were delicious! LOL"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 12 under a reservation. It took 50 minutes to place our order for food, after an hour seated we finally got our drink order. If you want a burger, one could literally butcher a cow, grind the beef, and cook it yourself faster than the \"service\" at this restaurant. One could probably drill a well for water faster than they brought it to the table, as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like everything about this place, and I did for the most part. The place was clean, inviting, and the food was pretty good. The person that greeted us was named Ashley, and she was great. I told her I was apprehensive about eating here because of the so-so reviews. She assured me that there were changes in staffing, and to give it a try.  We ordered 2 burgers:  1. BBQ burger with apple wood bacon and onion straws, and  2. The standard with American cheese, lettuce, and tomato.   **** The burgers were juicy , and the buns were soft. The regular fries were not too salty, and were pretty good. We also tried the tater tots in honor of Napoleon Dynamite ( Napoleon, give me some of your tots. No, go find your own.)  My 3 year old son seemed to like his grilled cheese sandwich, and the tots. For dessert, we decided to split a $6.00 triple chocolate milkshake. GOOD -- but not worth the money.....  Our total bill was about $40.00 and in my mind was about $10.00 too much. I don't think I would come back for burgers unless I took advantage of that movie ticket/food combo they offer for $15.00. That seems like it might be worth it.........."}
{"text":"What a find! By find, I mean a long, late night search for a burger from signs off the strip to a burger joint. I Love Burgers is located, which seems like miles off the strip in the Palazzo casino, behind the Venetian.  Up escalators, around malls and through casinos, we finally found I Love Burgers.  The beer selection was the best I've ever seen in Vegas; Lots of craft beer and rare Samuel Adams on tap. For dinner I ordered a $17 Korean Burger loaded with fried egg and kimchi. It was totally worth the $17. Amazing.  I would suggest this place to any burger lover with a compass!"}
{"text":"Over priced, burger was good, not great. Average. Soda selection was poor, probably never go back"}
{"text":"Drove in from LA without breakfast, and this was the 1st place i saw open after checking in at the Palazzo.  Got the chesseburger and mac n' cheese noms noms.  My burger, medium, was okay.  Tasty, but definitely no UMAMI.  The noms noms were definitely cheesey. Yeah it's pricey, but not outrageously more than other places in any of the \"higher end\" casinos.  It filled me up so no complaints there but not worth a special trip or anything."}
{"text":"I have to start this by saying I have been on a find the best burger kick in Las Vegas for a couple of years now.  I have tried:  Sammy's LA Pastrami - greasy and overwhelmed service  Holsteins - Pretty awesome Fatburger - cheap and pretty good BLT Burger - burger ok, not awesome.  Sides and shakes excellent Burger Bar - Ok, again, not awesome.    I went to I Love Burgers this past weekend with my family.  I have been wanting to visit this one in the Palazzo for some time.  I ordered the Ultimate Cheeseburger and we split tots and regular fries.  Burger was OUTSTANDING!!!  I added onion strings to it.    My family loved the burgers they ordered too.    Service was super busy, and it took a while to get our food.  Without asking, they deducted the cost of our drinks from the bill.  Very classy.  I will keep visiting this place on my visits."}
{"text":"Very good burger, good Mediterranean Salad. Pricey by non Las-Vegas standards, but in line with Vegas prices. We are likely to return."}
{"text":"Went in the morning before the start of a show. Had the egg and bacon sliders. Stuff was actually really good with added quail eggs.   Unfortunately, the staff could have given less of a damn and stood around talking to one another to get us silverware and other stuff sorta needed to make a meal happen.   Terribad service also screwed up two orders by delivering literally the entirely wrong offering to two in my party.   I at least had good to go service :/.   I love burgers. This place might...but their service said otherwise."}
{"text":"We were in town for the ConExpo 2014 with our Italian coworkers who wanted to see the Grand Canal at The Venetian and of course have an American burger.  After a bit of wandering, we ended up at I Love Burgers in The Palazzo.  The service was so so for it not being too crowded.  (It probably didn't help the guys from Italy needed some help with the menu although we successfully introduced them to tater tots and sweet potato fries!  Both are very good by the way.)  Also, if you're getting a draft beer, two 16 ouncers is cheaper than one 32 ouncer.  Leave it to Vegas to throw economies of scale out the window.  I got the Oregon Trail which is a buffalo burger on wheat.  Great tasting, but the patty is disappointingly SMALL."}
{"text":"So good! I ordered the bbq burger and it was so delicious I ate it in 12 minutes (it was huge). Service was good too.  I honestly didn't expect my burger to be so big.  This place is pricy, but you get what you pay for.  It was delicious, big portion, and good service.  Money well spent.  Will be back here next time I'm near by the strip again."}
{"text":"very impressed! the burger was fantastic the truffle frys where better. i also purchased the Mac & Cheese bites. extremely impressed with the food. will for sure be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The order: Bloody Mary  The I love Bacon Burger  Trust me. If you love bacon, you will love the order. The bloody mary comes with a stick of bacon. No joke.  (we also tried the turkey burger which comes with stuffing inside, but i personally thought it was way too sweet)   eh, to each their own. just not mine. unless it is the bacon burger."}
{"text":"The pro would be that the staff are friendly.  The young man behind the counter was polite and helpful.  So the staff was the best part of our experience.  Now for the food.  The burgers were ok.  My wife's burger said it had bacon but there was none.  The barbeque sauce was not very good.  She also ordered Onion Rings and they were to crispy and the sauce that came with them was not very good (tasted like a bad thousand island dressing.  My fries were ok but they were very thin and obviously had been frozen.    The worst part of the meal was the $6.00 for each shakes.  My wife ordered the triple  chocolate which came with powered chocolate on top and was just to strong for even a triple.  I ordered a strawberry which was totally uneatable.  I had marshmallows on top and some terrible spice mixed in that made it so bad after one taste I had to put it down.  $12 for shakes that we could not eat.  I was expecting great things from such pricey ice cream.  Our whole bill came to over $35 and we both said we could have had a much better meal for that price.  I do not mind spending money on food if it is worth it but clearly this food was not.  I wish we had checked Yelp before we decided to try it."}
{"text":"Meh...it was okay. To be fair, my boyfriend said his Caprese burger was \"exceptional\"...I took a safer route and ordered the Standard...which was, \"standard\".   It is a quirky, quick burger fix.   Maybe I was just not that hungry, maybe I chose the wrong burger, or maybe I was just having a bad day, but I've had better burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"This places is delicious, although they are slightly overpriced. Burgers were juicy and tasted amazing. Highly recommend the truffle fries as well."}
{"text":"Great food and no wait. We had a group of 5 and they seated us no problem. I love a good medium rare burger and it was delicious. I couldn't even finish it all ever though I wanted to. The staff was very welcoming and our waiter Leon was a doll  would definitely go back with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"This place honest to God gave me diarrhea right after eating there, their service is inconsistent, and their manager is a giant asshole so you can assure that this place will not improve anytime soon.    I will never eat at this location ever again. They have another location in Town Square that my friends say is amazing, but do yourself a favor and don't eat at their Palazzo location. I honestly regret choosing this place over In N Out.   I work in the Palazzo, so I used to eat here frequently because their menu seems like it'd be pretty good and it's the closest restaurant to where I work, but every time I've been there I was disappointed and was given really bad service. I work at a sushi restaurant and the way they treat their customers is kind of appalling to me. I can't see how they can treat anyone the way they do, let alone do it at work. I would definitely get written up or fired from the restaurant I worked at if I acted how some of them do towards customers.   Recently my brother and I ordered garbage fries to go and they forgot to put our order in for 30 minutes. Not the best customer service during that experience, but the shift manager paid for our food so I respected and appreciated that, and said I'd go back there and continue to try more of their food.   BAD DECISION. I come back a week later to order some food to go before I headed to work which was pretty much just around the corner. I had always ordered sides from there, so I was taking my time with the burger menu because I never ordered from it before. The manager (a different guy from the previous experience. I was told he was their general manager. He was in a red shirt and everyone else was in grey, seemed to be of Asian descent, black hair, tattoos) seemed annoyed that I was struggling to pick what I wanted on my burger rather than helping me out with the menu a little after I straight up told him I've never had a burger from them before. I even apologized because I didn't want to give him a hard time and said \"I'm sorry if I'm being difficult, I just haven't eaten anything all day\". He doesn't write down my order and goes to put it in. He comes back, I give him my card, and he sets it down, and leaves it unattended by their computer while he goes off to bus a bunch of tables instead of completing my transaction and giving me my card back. He then disappears in the back so I tell another server to let the manager know that I'll be back for my card, but I had to rush to work to clock in really quickly.   I come back and the manager is still no where to be found, my card just sitting unattended on top of their computer, out in the open, so I ask a server, \"I know my food wouldn't be done yet but could I get my card back because it makes me a little uncomfortable that it's just sitting there?\" He completely understood and got my card back to me happily, apologetically, and politely.   I go grab some coffee and then come back for my order. The manager drops off my bag of food, doesn't review what's inside, doesn't say anything, no \"here you go\" or \"enjoy\" or \"have a nice night\" and continued to walk off. I'm quickly trying to check the bag and then try to stop him to ask if there's any ranch in the bag, because I didn't see any and I specifically asked for some when he took my order. He kept walking and didn't stop so I thought he must not have heard me so I spoke up and said, \"excuse me is there ranch in the bag?\" He doesn't turn around, and practically barks \"HOLD ON!\" at me. The server who returned my card back to me witnessed the whole thing. I asked him what that guy's problem was and he just shook his head and said he was sorry and he didn't know. (I would later find out the silence was because it was his manager. I didn't know this until after this experience). I told the guy straight up that the way the manager was acting was rude and that I understood I was in a rush, but I work in the restaurant industry and it shouldn't have been hard for them to accommodate me. After all, the restaurant was near empty. I even explained to him about the previous time I was there that they forgot to put in my order for 30 minutes and he looked shocked.   The manager comes back with my ranch and slams it down in my bag and storms off. He does this right in front of the other server. I could not believe him. I got back to work to find my burger wasn't even cooked all the way through and the cheese for my tots was this luke warm, pale yellow, watery sauce that came in a a to go cup. My burger was super greasy, the bun was soggy, and it was practically falling apart as I ate it. About 20 minutes after I ate, I was running to the bathroom. It gave me diarrhea. And I know it was the food because like I said before, that was my first and only meal of the day and it was 5 in the afternoon.   Moral of the story: this place sucks and you shouldn't eat here unless you want to be pissed off and have a stomachache."}
{"text":"Its 2 stars because lets be serious, burger places pop up more then herpe cases in this town, and this place does nothing to separate. Dont get me wrong, its a decent burger but its on the greasy/mess side.  Patty is solid, and im a sucker for blue cheese on a burger, so the flavor I dig was abound.  That being said, so much oil was on it, the bun was a soggy mess, which tells me they dont really care about whats coming out.  Bocci, strip, and bar, are all better places to rock, but if you need some grease lube because you have trouble using the bathroom, or you want to have a massive food baby, then go here"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when I worked close by and it used to be a pretty good burger place. I loved their caprese burger. I came back after about 3 months and I never want to go back. They cut their menu down, and one of the burgers they dropped was the caprese. The place was too hot and uncomfortable to eat in. The food quality was bad, too much bun, small meat patty and it was dry. The fries needed work and the cheese they used for the fries was too gritty. Either they didn't put enough butter and milk in the mix or they added the canned Parmesan cheese in it. I do not recommend this place unless they decide to hire the cook who was there before, change their menu or change their management."}
{"text":"Caprese Burger....sooooooo good!!!  Great place to go, affordable too. Great portions, great service, even during a lunch rush during CES. Fried pickles were better than expected."}
{"text":"They have interesting burgers, but the fact of the matter is, it's still a burger joint. They're burgers are around $15-20. They're great, but they're not worth THAT much. What I do appreciate are the variety of burgers like the Caprese burger or the options of a sunny side up egg to go on top. To me, this place is like a level higher than Johnny Rockets or Islands, but at least those places give you french fries for free. Call me crazy, but I believe fries should come with a burger, especially if you're charging me a two-digit price for these suckers.   All in all it's a good place to visit if you're on the strip, but definitely not a place to go more than once. It was alright."}
{"text":"We love burgers and apparently so do they!  I ordered the BBQ burger and enjoyed it on their patio. It was delicious and the fries were great too. The service was standard exemplary - quick and easy.   The restaurant is clean and the patio has the right mix of shade and sunlight on an early fall afternoon."}
{"text":"This is 3.45 That I'm rounding down to a 3.  So I got a plain burger, and I just wanted roasted jalapenos and sauteed mushrooms on it.  The burger was really juicy considering they don't ask how you want it cooked, and it was almost well done.  But I can see how people may think the place is expensive considering my burger alone ended costing 10 dollars.  By the time you add a drink and fries, you're ending up with steakhouse prices.  Definitely not a place like it in Vegas.  More upscale restaurant prices.  Fast food service.  It's almost like you want the burger to taste bad so you can not like this place.  But the burger is good!!  I really liked it, that spicy bite you get and the pepperiness on your tongue.  It was really good.  I'm not sure what to think!!!!  I compare it to ATT phone service and my iPhone.  I mean you can make calls most of the time, service can be spotty though.  You get dropped calls though once in a while.  And you're paying such high monthly fees!!  But the phone is so cool!!!  I don't wanna get rid of the phone entirely.  What the heck?!?!?!  Do I switch service?  Do I go to another burger place???  AGHHHHH!!!!!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! Keep your money in your pocket! Go almost anywhere else, and get a better burger for a fraction of the cost. I ordered the Caprese Burger $8, with a Carmel Corn Shake $6, and my girl ordered the Ultimate Burger, with Sweet Potato Fries, and a Vanilla Shake. Total bill exceeded $36 bucks! (we left NO TIP)   Both burgers were tasteless to a point that condiments gave little re-leaf.  I ordered my burger without the Buns, and told them to wrap it in lettuce. They only put one, torn leaf of lettuce over it. WTF! To add insult to injury, the paper thin sheet of paper they had at the bottom of the plastic tray was soaked with grease, and it tore itself to shreds and came off with the burger when you picked it up. What a mess!!  Who want's to pick paper out of their mouth while eating. With all of the money you guys are getting for your burgers why don't you break down and get some cheap plates or something. The shakes were ok, but please! $6 each for 10 ounce cups?   Let me sum this place up for you! Some places deserve a second chance, but this place is not one of them! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"The service was ok, the food was pretty good but overall it was a last min closest spot for kids to eat.  We tried it, the shakes a must try they rock! The burgers are ok :)"}
{"text":"i had the oregon trail burger and onion rings. first and foremost the burger came on what looked like a very sad and lumpy and dry looking bun. i bite into not a lot of flavor and well a little overpriced. the onion rings were disappointing but the service was great and it was soooooo funny to hear the hostess ask every single person she walked past me \"so where are you here from!\"  it was hilarious and the even FUNNIER part if she would have opened her eyes is that we were ALL wearing our tags and they have our names AND where were from!!!! wouldnt come back again. sorry"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and super fast. The burgers were delicious and the truffle fries are worth checking out. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very expensive, burgers were rare, fries were cold, onion rings were gross and way over priced! Wouldn't come back here again! Not a fan at all of this place and I'm mad that I wasted my money here! Never again..."}
{"text":"Had the Oregon burger, and fried pickles. It was fantastic. Probably the best fried pickles I've ever had. Great ambiance, and great food. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"The garbage fries! THE GARBAGE FRIES!!!! With extra Jalapenos. That hit the spot after walking around for a bit. I would suggest getting the souvenir cup because you can bring it back and get a discount on your next beer. At least that is what the deal was when I was there. It's always a good deal to get a discount on beer!  I came back about three times during my weekend stay. They have a variety of burgers but I only tried the bbq burger with the fried mac n cheese. The burger was cook really well. I asked for well done and that was how it was cooked. I did not even have to add ketchup.  The fried mac n cheese was delectable but could have been crunchier.   Service at the bar was great."}
{"text":"Great low dollar comfort food.  For all the over priced restaurant's in these hotels, this is not one of them.  Burgers are great, side dishes are very good.  This is not a gourmet meal, but will be a very good comfort meal."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the server we had was kind of slow and didn't understand the concept of \"splitting the check\". We had such a hard time communicating with her and trying to tell her we want our checks split because we're all paying with a card."}
{"text":"On the spectrum of burgers, these are definitely pretty good. It's way better than a McDonald's or Burger King. However, I Love Burgers wouldn't want you to compare their experience to fast food, so I won't, either.  When comparing I Love Burgers to other gourmet burger joints, it falls short.  Let's start with the service. There was a small wait to get a table, even though there were tons of open seats. Granted, it was busy, but since the wait time for the actual food was around 45 minutes, wouldn't it have made sense to let us sit? Furthermore, even though we ordered fries, the waiter didn't even think to bring those out first -- we had to ask him. A simple thing like this would've made the time go by a lot easier.  Onto the food... like I said, the burgers are decent, but nothing special. I had the \"i love bacon burger,\" which comes with a patty made up of sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, toped with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, gouda, and onion strings. Given how ravished I was at this point, I was happy to eat it, but I don't think I'll ever need to try this place again."}
{"text":"If you're like me, and you've been to Vegas a billion times and dropped lots of cash on mediocre food at 24-hour casino diners and the like, STOP DOING THAT and get over to The Palazzo's I Love (heart) Burgers.  The menu is straightforward and simple - burgers, fries, shakes.  But oh, friends, it is SO much more than that.  Burgers of all kinds - veggie, bison, beef, turkey.  Fries aplenty and fried items galore - thick cut, skinny cut, sweet potato, pickle.  Shakes with alcohol and without - and in crazy combos that are both interesting and wildly successful.  My personal binge was a fuel-up after a long run - so I dove in to the Oregon Trail (moist, delicious bison and cheddar burger), a big ol' serving of dill pickle fries with house dipping sauce, half of a friend's order of baked potato wedge fries with blue cheese sauce (A MUST!!!), and my very own Blueberry Panshake - exactly what you think it is, a blueberry shake made with maple syrup and vanilla.  My dining companions - both of whom are vegetarians (!) - raved about the veggie burger and the Buzz shake (a concoction of coffee, Bailey's and more deliciousness) and we all went home pounds heavier and loads happier.  A MUST-EAT if you are sick of \"typical\" low-priced Vegas fare!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late night bite to eat, the service was quick and very friendly. The burgers were good, the beef tasted fresh and they cooked them perfectly. The fries were amazing. Crispy and hot like they should be! Price points are very reasonable - we'd be regulars if we had one in Seattle!"}
{"text":"On the look out for good beer and burgers, my friends and I came down to I Love Burgers to give it a try.  Although some of my friends weren't very impressed, I certainly wasn't disappointed.  Sure, this isn't my favorite beer and burger place, but it isn't a bad one either!    While the food at I Love Burgers is pretty good, I am not sure it is totally worth the price.  I got the big $17 Oregon Trail burger.  The ground Colorado buffalo was quite tasty, although I did have Dances With Wolves level guilt going on.  The price was a bit high for a place with AstroTurf on the wall.  It definitely has a \"to-go\" atmosphere about the place.  The fries were extra, and just weren't tasty enough to warrant me paying another $5.    The 4th star goes to the craft beer.  While not the best craft beer selection in town, at least they made an effort.  We ordered a pitcher of yummy Lagunitas IPA to go with our burgers.  Most of the staff doesn't know anything about beer, but the bartender, I think his name was Lloyd, impressed me with his beer knowledge.  This guy knew his stuff, and came over to chat with us about beer.    Overall I would revisit I Love Burgers if it was convenient.  There is a better beer place nearby though that will probably be getting the bulk of my Strip lunch business!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the I love bacon burger, holy shiitake mushrooms, these were some of the best burgers we've ever had! We both talked about it long after our meal was over. The bacon is incredible, the sauce they put on it is lovely, and the meat quality is awesome!! All-around great burger, we will be back!! Also, the girl that took our order was very nice and tolerant of my husband's lame jokes!    Just wish y'all had a location on the Westside."}
{"text":"I ate at the bar area. The service was good. The staff was friendly. I even received the free mac and cheese app for checking in. Like most of the comments the burger are good but overpriced. I had the bacon burger and fries. Overall it was good but not worth $30. If I get hungry for a burger I would go to In and Out or Habit burger for a third of the price. Again, not a bad place and good service just overpriced."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is the part where they have a happy hour burger and beer and they say I have to order it at the bar. I could not sit with my nephews and family in the normal sitting area, I would have to sit at the bar. The food was good, staff attitude is great. Prices are decent and ranch is free."}
{"text":"No love for I love burgers today. I called and placed an order ahead of time and when I got there they told me no one ever actually put the order in. Most places try to make up for their lack of customer service when that happens but they didn't really seem to care at all. The food is great but there are plenty of other places like it in town, with better service too. Probably not returning"}
{"text":"How does 'I Love Burgers' serve a burger that is the definition of mediocre?  I first ate at I Love Burgers last year and remember the food being good, and I was sober when I ate there. Fast forward a year and I. Was disappointed by my last visit.   Maybe it was because I had the Standard burger with cheddar. Maybe I should have tried the $24 Kobe beef burger. Regardless I don't see myself going back unless someone vouches for something specific on the menu.  The $6 \"fresh cut fries\" are not worth it and they do not taste fresh cut at all.  If you have to eat something fairly quick this place will do but please don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"I have the pleasure of staying at the Venetian a couple times a year for different tradeshows. I make it a point to come here at least one time during my stay - either for breakfast or a burger. For breakfast, they serve a Hawaiian inspired moco, but with this insanely good port demi glaze. They have some unique spins on bugers - like a Korean version with kimchi. And the bloody mary's have bacon in them - can't ever go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for breakfast! Unfortunately the only place that looked decent on a tight schedule and it was absolutely terrible. Poor service, greeted a total of 3 times, bread wasn't even toasted (aka ordered bread with omelette) and the quality of food was a generous 4/10. The omelette reminded me of the omelettes you get at continental hotel breakfasts.   Biggest pet peeve is other tables getting their food first when they say after and it happened twice. Both with tables of 2 (same as mine).   AVOID (for breakfast) IF POSSIBLE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Who don't love burgers ? This was the question that I asked my wife as we passed by the sign while shopping at the Grand Canal Shops at The Palazzo in Las Vegas during our most recent vacation to sin city. So it was we decided that for our next Culinary adventure we would sit down and gorge ourselves at I Love Burgers. The dining room is large with plenty of seating and lots of TVs to watch the games on. The menu is not overwhelming so you should not spend an hour trying to make a decision on what to eat (aka, that's you my dear wife).  For our appetizer we went with Mac and Cheese Nuggets. Little gems of Mac and Cheese breaded, fried and topped with shredded Parmesan are served with a side of spicy cheese sauce, because what else would be served with cheese but more cheese ? We finished these off pretty quickly and easily.  We could talk about my wife Simone's choice for an entree but I'm going to be honest, I don't want to. It was basically Eggplant Parmesan in a hamburger bun. Yes it was good, but why you would order a vegetarian burger at a place the specializes in cooking MEAT Hamburgers is beyond me. So on to some real food. I love Bacon... oh yes... Bacon Bacon Bacon... The I love bacon burger is kinda insane and you probably should consult you doctor before partaking in it. It is half a pound of ground sirloin and ground bacon pattied together and grilled up into one delectable smoky juicy mouth full of a burger meal. On top of this god like burger is yet more crispy applewood bacon, smokey Gouda cheese, fried onion straws and of course bacon mayonnaise. Absurdly delicious and filling, this was a treat for the tummy. Not that it was at all needed but we also ordered a not to be missed side of crispy thin cut Garlic Parmesan dusted french fries and managed to get most of those down also. As I was being rolled out on that stretcher by the paramedics, I couldn't help but smile about my I love Burger adventure"}
{"text":"Went there this weekend and had the BEST Bloody Mary I've ever had!  The bartender, Aaron, did an amazing job!  They don't use celery...but they do put a strip of bacon in it!  The bomb!!!  Would go there just for that!"}
{"text":"Tried out I Love Burgers for lunch last week and, as it turns out, I Don't Love Burgers.  Which is disappointing because in reality, I DO love burgers...with a lowercase \"b\".  I had the Caprese Burger, he had the one with buffalo meat, the one that's name escapes me right now.  My burger was dried out a little and just kind of bland.  I thought maybe it needed some more balsamic or seasoning or something.  I had a couple bites and moved on.  I had a bite of his burger, and it was decent, but I was already feeling kind of \"bleh\" about the joint so I didn't get overly excited.  The fried dill pickles we started with were pretty grand.  The natural cut french fries were pretty solid as well.  I had a sip of his chocolate shake and instantly went into a diabetes coma - SO SWEET!  The service was just OK.  I wasn't fond of our server - she lingered wayyyyy too long tableside when checking on us.  May be just a personal thing but it was annoying.  All in all, I wouldn't be whining too much - except our tab, with tip, was just over $60.  Honestly, I would've been happier at In N Out or McDonald's.  Two stars for most everything; one extra for the pickles."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place.  Customer service was exceptional, thanks Travis for all the wonderful recommendations, (every bite of everything you recommended was sinfully delicious) and also for taking time to make us feel so welcome. I'll give you 5 stars because I  think we got 5 star service."}
{"text":"I came here for the happy hour and had a phenomenal time with my wife. The bartenders and staff were a blast and made great drinks.  I will definitely come back for food next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and a great house beer. Sit at the bar for faster service and to avoid the families!"}
{"text":"I didn't quite fall in love with the burgers, but you are getting a good deal because the burger and fries are around $8.  What I did go gaga for were the large pickle chips - it had a substantial coating that stuck to the pickle and the outside remained crunchy.  Actually they should've been called pickle slabs or something.  The salad is disappointing, I've never been a fan of bland iceberg lettuce.  Make sure you order the MILSHAKES though.  YUMMO!!!!  We had the strawberry and caramel corn.  If you are hot in Town square, definitely order these!  They are so pretty and really fill you up."}
{"text":"Don't miss going here for breakfast! I am staying at the Palazzo for a week, and the first day we popped in here for lunch, and every morning since, I've come here for breakfast. Not only is the food fantastic, but the staff are amazing. On my 2nd visit here, they knew I was a repeat visitor, and by my 4th visit they even knew which table I like to sit at. This is unusual for the Vegas strip. Also, if you're a repeat customer who comes in for breakfast, they give you a discount!  The menu is loaded with options for all sorts of picky eaters, and they even modified one of their menu items to make scrambled eggs EXACTLY the way I like them. All the produce seems super fresh, and everything is beyond flavorful.   The table service is great, and as I mentioned before, the staff are very friendly. They go out of their way to keep my coffee cup nice and full. :)  I just wish I could take this restaurant home with me. Thanks I Love Burgers!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money! Server had to many tables and no help from any co workers. Mangers can't seemed to know when to step in and help. Burgers did not taste fresh at all. The prices are way to high!!"}
{"text":"***UPDATE***  I was contacted by someone at I LOVE BURGERS and they apologized and to me that says a lot when a business reaches out to you and acknowledges their mistake and promises to make it right and for that reason I have upgraded my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.  I will give them a shot next time I am in Vegas and hopefully they do it right this time.  We were getting ready to leave Vegas and we wanted to find something quick and boy did we make a mistake choosing this restaurant.  The first sign and the reason we should have left immediately was when the hostess told us that we would have to wait 15 minutes before we could order, but we still decided to give this restaurant a chance.  Problems:  1. Took 30 minutes to give me my drink 2. Took 60 minutes to give us our fries 3. Took 90 minutes for them to give us our burgers and not everyone got theirs and orders were messed up  What blew my mind was that they said they were not your typical IN N OUT and that their burgers were gourmet style.  Are you freaking kidding me????  Food finally came out and five of the eight in our group got our burgers and unfortunately I was the only person that actually liked my burger, while my friends had under cooked burgers.  They offered to comp us but we were not having it and just walked out.  Pros:  Chicken Burger was good Sweet Potato Fries Basil dressing  Cons:  Slow Unprofessional Unorganized Under cooked burgers Small grille Wasted space in restaurant  Unfortunately, this restaurant is poorly run and they probably won't be in business long due to the fact that they are unorganized, slow and don't know what the heck they are doing.  They need to get their act together quickly or they won't be around much longer.  Tried to be as fair as possible and even gave them 2 stars when most people would give them a 1 star."}
{"text":"The employees and the customer service was very good. Everyone was extremely attentive, so in that area, I don't have any compaints. Now, for the food, I ordered a chicken sandwhich and coming from a culinary background, I know for a fact they steamed the chicken on the grill or skillet by hitting the breast with water and covering it with a lid. It was like rubber and was not seasoned, absolutely nothing, no flavor. My sons burger was very blah. If you are going to charge these prices.....at least knock my socks off."}
{"text":"I DON'T LOVE THEIR BURGERS.  I like it but I don't love it. Food took way too long to come out and my medium burger was well done. I like the different sauces and their fries though. I had a better burger at serendipity and they don't even specialize in burgers. We ordered I love bacon and thanks to the bacon otherwise It's just an overpriced carl's jr. Plymouth's pride... don't even think about it might as well get a frozen turkey patty at the grocery store and microwave it.   I do love that their have variety of flavors and cuts for fries."}
{"text":"Your basic burger n fry joint in the Palazzo. Friendly staff and solid fare. No, I did not try those mac n cheese bites that are advertised everywhere. But I had a burger and fries and it met expectations. Would I seek this place out and crave it when I'm hungry? No. But would I stop by for a burger n fries if I were hungry as I'm walking by? Sure."}
{"text":"Great service great food and a fun atmosphere. Kenny is the funniest and happiest person I have met in years his service was top notch. Henry was working with us as well and heard me say I needed a charger and he told us they provide chargers if you give them your ID. Way to save my trip guys. This place is a little hard to find but worth every step. We will be back here again."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a burger joint. Definitely go for one of the specialty burgers. I got the classic burger, which wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind-blowing either. My fiancé had the Oregon Trail burger, which was phenomenal! The Oreo shake was good as well. It is worth a try if you're wanting a burger."}
{"text":"It was good, the burgers are decent and not very pricey for it being at the Palazzo in Vegas, the drinks are good."}
{"text":"This place was SUPER delicious!!! I ate here for the first time a week ago and I can't stop thinking the VEGGIE BURGER! It is seriously the best veggie burger I've ever had in my life!! It was juicy and tasty and super fresh and it's extremely hard to find meatless burgers that have so much flavor. The fries were equally delicious.  My only \"complaint\" was that it took really long to order. There were 2 cashiers but one just abruptly left with no explanation when I got to the front of the line.  Everything else made that a blurred memory.   Will mos def be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Wow... I'm so satisfied and full! We had the non nom Mac and cheese, fried pickles and garbage fries- all were amazing. My favorite was the garbage fries. Also, I had the heart and Seoul burger. It was cooked to perfection and had a great combination of flavors. The service was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Ok so to be fair my first review was way better than this one.  So I come here quite often and every time I get something different. So far I only like the kids meals with sweet potato fries.  :(  I hated the I heart organic chicken. It was so smothered in their Mexican pesto that you couldn't taste anything else. Plus the bread to chicken ratio is way off. Then I tried the nom nom mac n cheese bites. Hated it. So bland you had no choice but to dip in cheese dip for flavor.  Don't waste your money on that. All the girls with me said oh no you will hate them they are so bland. They were right.   This time I got the bacon cheese burger with truffle fries. Ok so I'm a bit weird I love pickles on my burgers and hate tomatoes. So add the pickles and remove the tomatoes. I ate the burger over the plate because it was dripping grease. The fries were so salty I was shaking every fry trying to knock off salt. So disappointed. Ok I'm back to grilled cheese kids meals with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Had the Dante burger. Ordered it med rare, got it well done. Side salad was romaine with a store-bought bottled vinaigrette dressing. Not the worst burger I've had, but not worth the price. Atmosphere is fun & the serving staff were nice & attentive, iced tea was really good!"}
{"text":"Service is great here!  East dinner here last night, came back for breakfast.  I heart French toast, and a side of fruit. Everything was great.  The hash browns were amazing.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Hubby had the caprice burger and really enjoyed it. I wanted the salmon burger but it has gluten in it. So chef made me a grilled salmon lettuce wrap. It was very good. Going back again and ordering a burger on a gluten free bun.  A bit pricey , but delicious."}
{"text":"Not bad for a burger place. It's fresh but takes a little more time and the yam fries are topped with brown sugar...a little overkill. Lucky for the four of us there was a free drink and fries promo which saved us $16! U had the inferno burger which wasn't hot at all, the BBQ burger was good and the ahi tuna salad sounded pretty good but we had a burger craving and this did the job."}
{"text":"In the Palazzo Casino/Resort. Quick place to eat. They had some cool looking milkshakes but we opted for tea only. Got the Angus Sliders which were pretty good along with the Lettuce Wedge w/ blue cheese. Not a bad lunch but pricy and service was very slow.   Short review, but nothing to really go crazy over."}
{"text":"This place looks so cute, and has such a great menu, that I had pretty high expectations for their food.  I was severely let down.  My mom and I both tried different burgers and neither of us liked ours.  Mine was eggplant and the whole thing was entirely too mushy.  Worst of all, the buns they use are terrible and flavorless.  The fries were slightly better, but not by much.  And it was expensive."}
{"text":"Nothing was outstanding and nothing was awesome about this place.   Prices were good. Location in town square was good (easy to find). Got the bacon burger, sweet potato fries, truffle fries and a coffee bean shake.   Everything was good but like I said not outstanding.  Happy hour looks like a good deal: 2pm-6pm, everyday."}
{"text":"Yes the burgers were better than average but when we received our bill of nearly $100, I quickly thought it was not that good.... My daughter's milk was not part of the kids meal drink, only a soft drink... yet they gave her a milk in a kid's cup and still charged me for a regular milk. Definitely overpriced...."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The burgers were just ok. My husband even got the feeling his beef patty was premade/frozen, not fresh. The garlic parm fries were pretty good. Wasn't a huge fan of the tempura batter on the fried pickles. They are called \"the best fried pickles in the world.\" I prefer Smash Burger's.  And it was over priced. $16 for a burger that was only mediocre is not worth it. Did not try any of the shakes which did look good."}
{"text":"Cool and casual atmosphere. The red, black, and white interiors with grass along the wall is fun. The service was friendly and our food came out in a timely manner.   My craving for poutine was unfortunately not satisfied. I was expecting the traditional Canadian dish of a mountain of cheese curds and fries smothered with brown gravy. Instead it was a slight twist on the classic with sliced mushrooms and melted mozzarella. The pickle spears tasted good at first, but quickly became too greasy.  I enjoyed the taste and creativity of the Seoul burger. The blend of sriracha, avocado, fried egg, wasabi mayo, onion strings, and angus beef was yummy!  If you are looking for a more affordable meal on The Strip and don't have high expectations, give I Love Burgers a try.   NOTE: Last weekend when I checked in on Yelp, I received a coupon for a free order of Fried Mac-n-Cheese Nom Noms! Too bad I checked in after we already ate and could not fit anymore in our stomachs =(!"}
{"text":"Being in Las Vegas we should do as they do! The restaurant has a really cool, laid back, friendly atmosphere. Our server Tracee was very charismatic, funny, entertaining and efficient. I ordered the Ultimate Burger and samples some of my friend's parmesan fries. I had an Oreo shake as well. Everything was very, very good. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars and not 5 is because things were way over-price. I know I'm in Las Vegas but, come on. My Ultimate Burger comes a-la carte for $22.00. It wasn't worth it and my shake was $8.00, EIGHT DOLLARS. So with that being said, I won't ever eat here again because of things being so over-priced, but I do recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"This is a one stop shop for the best burgers and beers!!! Ask for Darrel or Sheila the service they provide is impeccable. Best happy hour between 2-4 $1 beers can't complain. If your ever in town square check it out."}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick dinner here on my last stay in Las Vegas.  It's not a bad place, but not outstanding in anyway either.  The food and service was good - it was efficient and no frills.  My turkey burger was well prepared and the bun was fresh.  I liked the taste of it, but I've also made better at home.  They boast having the largest french fry menu on the strip - their fries are pretty good.  There are several options for condiments, but we stuck with good ole ketchup.  They do have a very robust beer selection with several microbrews available at a pretty good price.  We didn't get hijacked for a $14 Chimay here like we did at Stack.  If you want a burger at a decent Las Vegas price... this is a decent place to go."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great service. We tried the spicy burger and the traditional ones. The only thing I didn't like was the fries. They were a little stale. The beer was cold and flowing. And AMAZING military discount."}
{"text":"I ordered a 17 dollar burger and asked for bacon.  When I'm paying 17 bucks I expect the order to be correct.  There was no bacon!  Where's the bacon?  Not on my burger.   Get it together people."}
{"text":"I love burgers and this place certainly is called that for a great reason, they have deliciously juicy burgers as well as other food items to boot. After eating here for the first time, I find it hard to grab a burger anywhere else.  It's simply a letdown.  I ordered the inferno and while it wasn't as spicy as one would derive from the description it certainly was delicious.  It was juicy, not overly seasoned or over salted.  It is a carnivore's dream come true on a bun! The grass fed beef had a nice flavor to it. The sides were equally flattering.  We shared the Mac and cheese nom moms and fried pickles.  The crinkle cut lengthwise wise pickles with the crunchy breaking were mouth wateringly good.  Keep in mind, great comes at a price.  It's not cheap but it's definitely what I would expect to pay for something for this quality on the strip.  Overall, I thought prices were fair and I'd definitely come back. On two separate times, I have come back for breakfast. Firstly, I ordered the sausage burrito and then I had tried the wagyu Kobe skillet.  The burrito is a good size, good ingredients and filling.   The Kobe skillet was great with the Kobe beef pattie, tater tots, eggs and cheese along with spinach and bacon bits."}
{"text":"Burgers and drinks were good service and appetizers were not that great ."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that I Love Burgers was a walk-up, fast food style place. It's nicely decorated. Good atmosphere.  I had the I Love Bacon burger without the mayo or onions, tater tots, and ice tea. It was all fine. I could eat there again, try a different burger. I woudn't seek it out though.   I didn't notice any bacon inside the brisket patty. Perhaps it was ground into the brisket? It was done and a tad dry. Tots were standard fare. Ice tea was strong and in need of lemon."}
{"text":"I kept passing this restaurant when I stayed at the Palazzo, so one afternoon my bf and I caved in and decided to try this restaurant out. When I came here on a Saturday around 2.30 for a late lunch, the restaurant was pretty empty. I ordered the Parmesan Garlic Fries and it was pretty good, nothing too amazing, but we did finish them and order a second order (so either we were hungry or it was amazing, you decide).    We split the Tuscan Kale Salad, and it was just your average salad, nothing too spectacular, it did have pine nuts so it gave it some life...but i don't expect burger joints to have spectacular salads anyways.   But the best part of the meal was the Wagyu Prosciutto Burger. The burger only was $25, which some may think is pricing for a burger, but the wagyu was amazing. The burger was cooked to perfection, pink center and everything. The prosciutto was so crispy it tasted like bacon:) The burgers don't come with fries, so get ready to order fries if you want some.  I would definitely come back just for the Wagyu burger:)"}
{"text":"Ok, Here's the deal with this place. The reviews were so mixed that I was afraid to try it. I went there two months ago when my MIL was in town and we needed a fast bite to eat in between shopping and doing the vegas thing.  I didn't find it to be expensive. I'm not sure what people are talking about. The Burgers on the menu range from $6.00-$11.00. The \"catch\" is the toppings. They offer a huge variety of cheeses, peppers, mushrooms, bacon, eggs and everything but the kitchen sink. .... BUT They're $1.00 per topping. I can see where people can end up with a $19.00 burger.   If you order off the menu with a few toppings you'll be in the low price range if that's what you're aiming for.   Not us... We are extreme and we need the works! hee hee! My Husband ordered Their \"Inferno burger\" -- $7.99 Pepper Jack Cheese, Roasted Jalapeños, Lettuce,  Tomato, Jalapeño Mayo. Then we added a few extras for the added bang!  I ordered  The Caprese* $7.99 Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato, Basil, Balsamic  Reduction. It was amazing. Simply amazing. I'm not a \"Burger Person\" but this was A game good.   The burgers were big but we needed to go all out and we shared Garbage Fries   $6.99 Natural Cut Fries w/ Buffalo Chili, Jalepenos, GreenOnion, Cilantro, Black Olives And Aged Cheddar Cheese Sauce... Can you say DIET FOOD? Not :) They rocked!  They have a basic kid's menu, everything on there was $4.99  They're SUPER family friendly. We need that with 4 kids. They have a chalkboard room! All the walls are chalkboard painted so the kids can literally draw on the walls while you wait for your made to order burgers!.. Who needs crayons? ... Kids had so much fun. I have to admit I had fun chalking it up too!   Let me warn you parents-- Your kids will be COVERED in chalk dust. I had to shake them out before we got in the car but it was worth it.    OOhh OOhh OHHH How can I forget!! We didn't take them up on it because it was a kid filled adventure day but they have a FULL BAR!  Shake Your Love, their shake menus offer spiked shakes! They're $6.00-- VODKA please! Here's their flavors--Blueberry Panshake, Carmel Corn, Outrageous Oreo Tahitian Vanilla Bean, Triple Chocolate, Strawberry, Coffee Bean, Orange Delight  They don't have a happy hour they have a Happiest Hour.. epic.  1/2 Price specials all day at the bar  All Appetizers & Select Drinks   Yelp on :-)"}
{"text":"Solid burger joints are always a plus for me. The burgers here were very good and I felt the portion was just right. They have interesting burger toppings and a variation of fries and shakes. And yes, you can get them \"spiked\". Also the service was great. Check it out next time you're at the Venetian/Palazzo."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place? Took my three children there because we love Town Square and they were eager to try the new burger restaurant that recently opened.   We walked in - and first thing I noticed was that even though there were maybe five tables seated - no one had food yet. Everyone was waiting. Ok. Maybe they just got a rush. We order at the counter, and the girl was very pleasant, even when our total came to almost $60. Really?! This was for nom-noms, chicken fingers (no fries), two burgers with fries, and three milkshakes. One would think that for this price, food and service would be impeccable, especially when it is set-up like a glorified cafeteria. Oh but no ...  Food arrives. My son's order is wrong and needs to be sent back. (He ordered a BBQ Burger and was given a cheeseburger.) My younger son's burger is undercooked and needed to be sent back. (We like our burgers medium. This was RARE. Like, tar-tar in the middle.) It may have been tasty, but too risky for my 6-year-old to eat. Fries were good. Chicken finger 'appetizer' which were @ $6? Only 3 fingers. $2 a finger. Umm ... ok. Shakes were tasty, but for $6 a pop, they should exceed mere tasty.  Here's the kicker. We chose a table that gave us a great view of the cooks, who spent A LOT of time laughing, joking, chatting (I'm all for fun in the workplace, but they were LOUD, in an already loud restaurant), and every time a woman would walk by, my children and I got to hear a full review of what they thought of her chest, her butt ... whatever. I was so embarrassed for the women, for my family, and for the cooks for making such jackasses out of themselves. I wanted to complain, but just decided to leave instead. My guy suggested I complain on Yelp, so here I am. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.  Had the inferno burger and wife had the Dante burger.  Got a side of parmesan garlic fries and fried pickles. The burgers were ok, nothing really special except for the buns.  For $5 the fries were a joke - a small order of shoestring fries barely covered in cheese.  The fried pickles were the deal of the whole meal at $3 and they were very good. Burger prices were high @ $7 per burger.  Soft drinks were set at $2.50 for a 16 oz cup - refills or not it's still expensive."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on my way to my room at the Palazzo. This was my last day/night in Vegas and I was sick. All I wanted to do was stuff my face and be alone in my room. I sat at the bar to place a carryout order. There is a carry out counter/window but they were understaffed so I was told to place my order at the bar. They lady was nice but clearly stretched thin. I placed my order & it arrived in a good amount of time.  I ordered sliders, tater tots, & fried Mac & cheese. The fried Mac & cheese was my favorite. They were really good. The tots were alright as well. The sliders seemed a bit bland & could have used more flavor.  Overall it was a good meal & Vegas priced (high for what you get). I'd go back & try something else. They also have breakfast so I'd love to try that too."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if you want a burger. Very clean and staff is friendly.  I got the standard cheese burger and Nom Nom's (Fried Mac n'Cheese) with cheese dipping sauce. The Nom Nom's were really good. Comes with 8 of them. The Cheese burger was standard just as it states. Not extraordinary. Overall, a great place to try out."}
{"text":"One of the few really affordable places to grab food in Town Sq. So that is a bonus. The burgers are really good, although a bit on the smaller size compared to others in the city. We live in a burger obsessed city!  So to compete with others like BurGr, Distill, Bachi you have to be on your game.  The meat tastes SUPER FRESH! Clearly they go the extra mile to give you farm fresh ground beef! You can really taste the difference. The side options are great, FF, Sweet potato fries, even tater tots! As well as many different options for cheese, beacon,, etc. That part is great.  Every time I have been in the service has been fantastic. Super friendly, very attentive.   Would happily hit this place before a movie, or when shopping at TS."}
{"text":"I would not advise coming here..it is way way over priced for what you get...i was staying at the hotel and felt like a burger..would of been better off jumping in a cab and going to in and out, wendys or some place else..place was empty...suppose this was a bad sign...lol        Greasy floors and dirty place inside in addition to that food was crap and i mean crap..meat NO flavor and some how medium welll means raw SEE MY PHOTO...NO JOKE LUCKY I NOTICED AND DIDNT EAT MT BURGER...I COULD OF GOTTEN SICK...THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING...IDIOTS!!!!!!   SKIP THIS PLACE AND GO TO THE MANY OTHER NICER PLACES TO DINE IN THE Hotel they need to shut this down."}
{"text":"-checked in on foursquare and got free Mac &cheese nom noms!   other things we got:  Parmesan fries kale salad which was sooo good! and the I love seoul which I totally recommend!!  These were split between 3 people so it was just enough!  Also we're in vegas and i know all us girls don't want to eat too much bc we don't want to be fat for the clubs later, so come here if you're looking for something to eat that's affordable and splitable"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I do not love burgers...I barely like them.  It shouldn't be surprising that I did not like a place called I Love Burgers.  I got the Loco Moco cause it looked HELLA good in the pictures plastered all over the Palazzo & Venetian.  It was not as good as I thought it would be and I got the runs, so I still don't like burgers.  Cool service and atmosphere tho and I think the others really enjoyed their meal here."}
{"text":"my bf and i were staying at the palazzo august 8-11th so we got the carnival book for free. since i love burgers was part of the deals in the book- we used the 15% coupon deal.   when we first arrived the deco was pretty random- theres grass and random chalk writing on the ceilings. the service was alright nothing too spectacular and atmosphere was a lil busy.   we decided to do fried mac and cheese nomnoms, garlic parm. fries, i tried the love&seoul burger and my bf had the bacon cheeseburger. since looking the reviews- the two sides were the most popular.   i think out of all of that the mac and cheese nomnoms were the best. my burger was alright and was a bit dry and the fries were too overpowering with the garlic flavor.   im glad we used the deal and got the discount because i wouldnt pay for the full 50 buck bill.  next time im def gnna try holsteins (spell check) at cosmo. this place was a lil subpar and didnt make me go \"oh yeaa! best burgers everrr!\" if you guys arent staying at the palazzo or venetian to recieve the carnival book- you guys can always check in on yelp for the deal on the free nom noms."}
{"text":"So, my review is probably a bit biased since I came here after pretty much starving for the whole day, so the burgers tasted amazing... but looking back, they were probably just decent.  That being said, the service was great, and the restaurant was large enough to hold a lot of people (but we were there during off-hours, so it was pretty empty).    Overall: If you're in the Palazzo looking for a quick bite to eat, go for it, but if you have time to plan out a meal, I'd look somewhere else (you're in Vegas afterall... go big or go home, right?)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was even better. Sean the bartender really knows how to mix a drink. Amazing!"}
{"text":"For what you pay, it's not worth it.  The salad was overloaded with bleu cheese and balsamic vinegar, ruined my palate for my mild burger.  The patty was cooked kind of soft (reminded me of warm and wet paper mache) and the bread was soft but it was missing something.  The guy taking orders was pretty nice for 1 person during dinner but kept forgetting things like silverware, charged me for the soda that came with a kid's meal, went to check if they had wheat buns and never came back to tell us, all minor things but noted.  The fries weren't very good, the shoe string ones were over cooked and just dry not crispy or hot and the baked potato ones were under cooked.  Next time I'm going elsewhere like Burger Bar."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast. Place was clean and everyone was very nice. Natasha was our server, she was nice and very welcoming. Food was great, served hot and fast.  We ordered the French toast and build your own omelete. Would come back next time we're in vegas. Thanks Nathasha!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick, casual dinner with a bachelorette party and it was great. We were staying at the Palazzo already so it really convenient for that. Our server Dee Dee was GREAT! She was super friendly and even split our bill 9 ways for us. I ordered a kale salad, which was pretty basic but was still good. Another girl go the fried mac n cheese (or something like that) and it was delicious! The milk shakes were a hit with our group as well. We went around 9pm on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table."}
{"text":"Had to walk a ways to get to this place. When in Las Vegas you plan to walk a lot. The food was well proportioned. The fries were awesome and loved the special sauce."}
{"text":"The wedge salad was awesome!!   My husband loved the Blood Mary and the parmesan and garlic fries are equally divine and the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"The bread was not toasted very odd so the bread was cold they charge extra for fries and drink the fries were soggy not very hot at all. I do not recommend this place at all. My wife just showed me the salt and pepper shakers they look like they have not been cleaned since they opened several years ago.  What YER getting here is a cheap Macdonlds hamburger. Don't waist YER time or money."}
{"text":"Burger meat was over cooked , they brought the wrong order and it was not great . For a 25$ burger this place was not worth it"}
{"text":"My dad is a sucker for a good burger.  I am a sucker for  fries.  It landed us here, at I LOVE Burgers.  I didn't experience the crappy service that the other people seemed to have, which was nice!  However, I agree with the other patrons who said that the food here isn't really worth the $$.  My mom and I split the chicken sandwich, and my dad got a bacon cheeseburger, and my husband got some sort of hot-n-spicy business.  It was pretty good, but my dad's bacon burger was really good--it had bacon actually IN the meat--yum!  And he ordered it well-done, and the waitress had the foresight to mention that it would be well-done, but it would look medium because of the hue the bacon gives to the meat.  We also got a basket of fries to share amongst the table, and it was plenty.  The chicken sandwich was really good as well--very juicy and flavorful.  And the barbecue sauce I ordered on the side was delightful as well!  Very good taste to it!  The drinks we ordered were really good, too.  I had a frozen margarita that was delicious.  My husband had some yummy imported beer that he thought was good, too!  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent.  However, for the price, it was definitely NOT worth the price.  Better burgers are available for the same or even cheaper price.  The taste was okay, but the portioning was kind of small.  Also, they overcharged my debit card and i've called twice and they said they would respond back... they didn't call me back each time....  EDIT: 7/18  THE OWNER OF I LOVE BURGER'S PERSONALLY YELP MESSAGED ME AND GOT THIS TAKEN CARE OF!! GAVE ME A FULL REFUND OF MY OVERCHARGE (ESSENTIALLY MAKING MY MEAL FREE!! AND THEN SOME MONEY!)  ALTHOUGH I'VE HAD BETTER BURGERS FOR THE PRICE IMHO, THE OWNER IS TOP RATE AND DEFINITELY KNOW'S HOW TO HANDLE HIS BUSINESS!! 3 STARS!"}
{"text":"I Love the Black Bean Burger. So much so I came back two days in a row. As a vegan, I left off the sauce and added avocado. Very flavorful and hearty.   And the extra crispy fries were well worth the carbs....I traded the bun for the fries."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my uncle ... service was friendly and a business that supports military by offering discounts, bought a smile to my retired military uncle. Enjoyed the Oregon Trail with truffle fries friendly service staff and the food and price point was perfect."}
{"text":"I DID NOT Love \"love burger\" like I should have... Where to start.. Service took forever. Food was dry and boring. (Yes food was boring) nothing really stood out about this place. I was honestly looking for a nice small meal, but came across the wrong place.   Service: We were seated quickly, however we sat there looking at the wall, customers, servers talking to each other waiting to have our order taken.. Took about a good 30 minutes for us to actually make an order.  Food: I ordered the original burger. The patty was so dry I felt like I was eating cardboard. The massive amounts of ketchup did not help. I didn't even finish half of it..   Overall: There's nothing great about this place except for possibly the name... Yup.."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Finally got my fix of buffalo burger! I've been craving once since I was last at Colorado 2 years ago.   I ordered the \"Oregon Trail\" Buffalo burger with no cheese or sauce and added avocado. Delicious!!! I was reminded how much I love buffalo meat. Mmmm... buffalo meat. I ate every bite of my burger. My friend ordered the Garbage fries (which I ate quite a bit) and delicious too.   My only problem was that I added avocado for $2 and I got 2 skimpy slices of avocado. It didn't even cover half of my patty.   Price: The specialty burgers are a little expensive but I think to try it once for a great burger, then come eat here and shelf out the $20.  Service: Our server was pretty friendly. Sometimes it was difficult to get her attention - the place is pretty large and it was ful of people. I always wish there is a button (like in Korean restaurants) to get your server's attention.   If you want a great burger in Vegas - eat here. It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Update from 5/17 Went in late on Tuesday, around 8:45 ish I think. Walked right past the hostess stand and cruised up to my spot in front of the TV's at the bar. Chatted with the bartender for a second and got right to it. I ordered the Dante and subbed the bleu cheese for a slice of cheddar. Seriously, it came in LESS than 5-6 minutes cooked medium and there were about 30+ people dining tonight, (I'm pretty sure there's a show that gets out just about that time.)   I was amazingly surprised how fast it was. Didn't order any fries or a shake this time, but usually go with the sweet potato fries, garlic Parmesan fries, or the mozzarella sticks. Ordered one of my favorite beers, the Leinenkugel sunset wheat on tap. Friggen YUMMMY beer, has a light citrus-y taste to it. I am and always will be a repeat customer here, top notch in my opinion.  Everything was fresh, fast, and you get what you pay for here. The Dante is one of their more expensive burgers, ($15 I think) but like I said, you get what you pay for. This place is still a lot more reasonable than the celeb chef restaurants in the palazzo/venetian, where you're gonna pay 50+ just for an entree and a drink. You're paying for the name, not for the product. Excellent damn burger, oh so juicy. The caramelized onions just fall out of the burger, it's actually a little annoying how many onions there are on this thing!!!  side-note: Also got to witness the end of Dirk scoring 48 points against the OKC Thunder, that was impressive. So I started up a chat with two other guys sitting at the bar about how fun it is to watch somebody score that many points in the playoffs. Friendly people hanging at the bar, so that's fun meeting new folks. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I Love Burgers makes a very cool burger.  The menu states the burgers are cooked medium. So I did a fake arm \"stretch\"  and yawn so I could peek at other customers tables and see their burgers. The lady next to me had a very pink burger, so I asked for my Baconator burger to be cooked meduim well.  When my waitress brought it to me, it was actually well done and a little dry.  But the burger was very tasty.   Would i return to I Love Burgers? Probably not because I could have eaten at Bruchon (sp) a nice resturant in the Venetian for the $44 I spent at I Love Burgers.  I ordered the Baconnator and a coke. My wife ordered Sliders from the appatizer menu and a coke and it costed us $44.    My waitress was cool and very attentive. She was very touchy feely with me for some reason."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I had the Kale Salad with Blackened Chicken, and a side of Sweet Potato Fries.  The price is really good for The Strip.  The service was kind of slow, and there weren't a lot of people in there.  I was actually surprised that the service was slow because they surely deal with much larger crowd than the several tables that were in there at the time.  Other than that, no complaints at all.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Poor quality dry burgers that are pricy. The burger was called when I received it as well. Go somewhere else for the price"}
{"text":"I got the Oregon Trail and Tater Tots.  Not impressed.  Flavorless Bison Burger.  Mushy Bun.  Overwhelmed by the garlic in the aioli.  And expensive.  Not worth the money or time."}
{"text":"Employees standing around, we had to wipe down our own table.  No flavor burgers & fries.  Next time will try something less expensive & with more flavor."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite to eat and stumbled upon this restaurant. The menu was simple hence the name. What we weren't expecting was a terrific staff and a pretty decent burger. Matt was exceptional and gave us his favorite suggestions. He couldn't have been more accommodating! His service was on point without being obtrusive. Everything came out in a timely manner and he anticipated our every need! Thank you Matt and manager Omar for enhancing our dinning experience! We'd come back just for the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for breakfast. The French Toast was very good - the toast was perfectly prepared compared to most other locations that I have had French Toast at. My wife had the design-your-own omelet with delicious hash browns. She stated that it was very good. The staff was friendly and prompt. Very pleasant experience.  Thank you"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this place yesterday at lunch. It was not crazy busy, but nonetheless I had to wait 20 minutes before my burger and fries were delivered to our table. It was huge and beautiful, the truffle fries smelled amazing, but then I took a bite of the burger and had to spit out this mouthful of raw meat. I'm not talking a bit pink, I'm talking totally raw except the outer layer and still refrigerator cold in the middle. I never return food, but I'm not going to risk eating raw beef, so I take it up to the kitchen and they say they will re-cook it...then I wait another 30 minutes before I walk back to the kitchen and they are still working on it. Saying My order had to go to the back of the line. Not being helpful or apologetic, but giving off irritated vibes towards me.  I stood there until they delivered it 5 minutes later -- in a to-go box and no truffle fries and certainly no \"it's on the house since we screwed up your lunch twice and made you wait over an hour for a burger and fries\" make-good."}
{"text":"The first few visits were very good here...I didn't realize they had a bar off to the side of the place and I stumbled upon it by mistake.  The bartender was very helpful at suggestions and always recommended for me try whatever was new on the menu.    Then my last visit became just that....\"my last visit.\".  A new bartender was in place and he needs to understand what customer service means.  As soon as I took a seat, he didn't acknowledge me at all as he was too busy watching the baseball game on the TV.  When I got his attention, he seemed miffed that I interrupted his concentration.  He made no suggestions to the specials, only asked \"what can I get ya?\" The martini was average and he forgot about my guest's beer until I called his attention to the matter.  \"Oh yea, sorry dude,\" he said. He then went back into a conversation he struck up with another guest sitting at the bar who apparently works next door at Yardhouse.    For the remainder of the evening, he never came back to check on us, offer a refill, or ask how the food was....he was focused on his buddy from the bar next door.    Sadly, when a business forgets about its customers, the customers will eventually forget about the business..."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 4 for good service and nicely presented food. Okok the food wasn't food to drool over but when you're staying in the palazzo and looking for a quick bite to eat - this place hits the spot!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food wasn't bad it just wasn't out of this world. It was literally empty on a Saturday night which is not a good look... They were very quick and attentive but like I said there was one other table. I had the I love Bacon & egg sliders ( 3 of them $14 ) they were good but nothing to write home about..."}
{"text":"Bad burgers and even worse service!! If you want a great burger go to In and Out!!"}
{"text":"Dry nasty expensive burgers!! I almost choked on one of their burgers because it absorbed all the spit in my mouth. If you want a great cheap burger go to In and Out. Not much more to say."}
{"text":"Here's what I'll say about I Love Burgers: delicious.   Really I'm going to leave it at that. I will add that it's pricy, but if you've had a bit too much to drink and need something greasy and delicious to bring you down this is it. I Love Bacon burger and natural cut fries is. Where. It's. At.   Go. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I don't like the new menu, they removed a lot of great food. What happened to the turkey burger? When they changed the menu they also changed the size of everything. Now the bun and burger are much smaller and the drinks are so tiny I can't believe they are $2. The only thing that I love are the fried pickles... they are still amazing."}
{"text":"Very nice server. She was super attentive to our needs.  Some kitchen problems.  Order took about 30 minutes although it was fairly slow at 11:30 on a Sat. Two of our six orders had to be sent back.  First one incorrectly had cheese on it and second was requested medium ears and delivered well done."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good deals with happy hour and BOGO. Great service. GM was very kind and attentive. Nice sit down for the bar."}
{"text":"All natural grass fed beef. You can taste the difference in the patty. Truffle fries were lacking on the truffle taste. Like they barely drizzled any truffle oil on it. If the fries were better I'd give 4 stars. The inferno burger I had was topped with pepper jack and jalapeños. Very tasty. Also, the menu up front had no description of what each type of had in it. That's another minus."}
{"text":"This review is not written in anger, however I felt completely ripped off at this place. The price was high, the burgers were dry, and service was slow. I would say more, but it just feels like I'm being nasty. Let's just say my boyfriend and I were very disappointed. The only reason I would go back is out of curiosity for the mac n cheese bites. I only hope that the management will learn from these comments."}
{"text":"The place is nice for a low key (definitely not upscale) restaurant. The bartender was rude and didn't know anything about the beers on tap. The Wagyu Kobe was $25 and the driest bland burger ever. The heart and soul burger ($17) was very good and flavorful however I asked for no egg and in return they left off 2 additional ingredients. Should have looked at the reviews before going. Expensive for not the best overall quality."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I sit in the restaurant. The ordering process was pretty quick and painless.  The staff is super friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs. I ordered a not fancy cheeseburger, fries and a soda.  There are approximately 8 tables of people here in a space that could seat 50 families comfortably. Having said all that, 35 minutes is too long to wait for food. The burger isn't bad but the fries are a little on the cold side.  There is an open kitchen so I was able to see my food sitting there. I would give this 4 stars if they can figure out how to get the food out fast. I'm all about second chances so I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was looking for the best burger in Vegas.  I didn't find it here.  I did find a nice hamburger and some good sides.  The fried mac & cheese bites were delicious.  The tater tots were portioned for two.  You know what?  From what I saw, everything here is portioned for two, except for the burgers.  It's good here, I'd come back... I just wouldn't rush back.  On second thought, they said that they couldn't put the Giants football game on, maybe I won't go back."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Fast friendly service, bright ugly room.  I ordered the standard burger rare, fries and fried pickles.Was told burgers come on a dry bun, no dressing, offered mayo, asked for 1000 island, offered Loui sauce on side, asked to have it on the bun.  First burger came with a wet, saturated bottom bun. Maybe was set in a puddle, don't know  why it was so wet, but sent it back. Tried to eat fries while waiting on second burger, they were swimming in oil. Gross.  Sent them back. Second burger was much better but no more than ok. Meat was rare but also lacked any sear - grey meat red and cool in center. Little flavor or juice. Boring, another burger with a pale bun. Sauce was very good. Nothing special. Second fries were fantastic, perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Fried pickles were just that.  tasted like pretty much any jarred pickle sliced in planks, battered and fried.  No reason to return ever."}
{"text":"If I had to sum up I Love Burgers in three words, they would be \"didn't love it\".  My wife and I ducked in here during a visit to town square. Yardhouse looked busy and we wanted something more casual, so we thought we would give this new place a try. It certainly looked low-key.  I ordered \"The Inferno\" and a side order of onion rings. It was rather expensive for what you got. The onion rings were fine, tasty enough, but at around six bucks for the serve there were so few that you were looking at just under a buck per onion ring. for this price there should be enough of them to share with the entire table -- even at a place like Town Square --- particularly when you can get a gargantuan tower of much better onion rings, mere feet away, at Yardhouse for not very much more.  The burger itself was OKish - I know they call it \"inferno\" and I LIKE hot things, but I have become used to hyperbole when dealing with \"hot\" fast food where words like \"inferno\" simply mean, spicy. They aren't kidding around here - The Inferno burger comes with fresh, not pickled, jalapenos, complete with seeds. They are only lightly seared and remain a little bit crunchy, so it's almost like you have partially raw, crunchy, cut up peppers in your burger. After a few bites my eyes began to water, my nose began to run, and I had to take a long drink after every bite. Hot and spicy is one thing, but as another reviewer said, the jalapenos in The Inferno totally overwhelm the other flavours. I also wasn't crazy about the very soft buns here, either. I prefer a slightly crusty bun, but I understand that in the US people generally prefer the soft bun, so I'll put that one down to cultural preference and leave it at that. the problem is, though, that everything about the burger -- soft bun, soft pattie -- (with the exception of the crunchy jalapenos) was a bit gummy and mushy. There wasn't any feeling of substance to each bite.  Overall, I Love Burgers serves up a product that I don't feel is vastly superior to places like Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. Yes, it IS better than these places in that the ingredients are clearly of good quality and the burger is well assembled, but at the end of the day it's still very clearly a fast food offering. With prices and a location like this, I feel that these guys could go that extra mile toward turning out something truly remarkable, worthy of reminding punters why burgers are something they might one day fall in love with all over again."}
{"text":"I work at town square and I love burgers... Enough said! I am always in search of a delicious burger - they are my weakness!  We order food from I  Burgers usually once a week or once every two weeks. I would eat here everyday if I could! I have not been to the one on the strip with the extended menu, but the one in town square works for me.   It is fast food, but it makes you feel like you aren't eating fast food. My favorite burger is the the INFERNO. It has pepper jack cheese, jalapeños, and jalapeño aioli. If you don't do spicy, you may not want to try it. But if you like jalapeños, definitely give it a shot. They also have nom noms which is fried mac n cheese. We always get an order for the office, sometimes two, since everyone loves them. They also have a cheese sauce that goes with them. Try their tater tots too. They are crunch and delicious!"}
{"text":"These two stars are for the appetizers and creativity.  But overall place is overpriced & not worth it.  Hubby's bacon burger had fatty bacon & both our burgers we bit into hard fatty pieces."}
{"text":"I go frequently as  I drive through Vegas to visit family in Utah. The entire place has improved dramatically recently, and 5 stars is really the only fair review I can give them now.  The manager, in particular, obviously cares very much about his restaurant and his customers. It's a good thing to see, and much too rare these days."}
{"text":"This was the only place I checked into in Vegas on Yelp... Whoops! I had a ton of fun but this I Love Burgers place was really good! We had a groupon deal for a thing of nom noms- fried mac 'n' cheese squares and two yard-sized frozen alcohol drinks! Let me just say the nom noms were OUT OF THIS WORLD good- so filling. It even came with a side cheese. My friend and I decided to share a burger prior to coming there and I am so glad we did. We got a traditional burger with gouda cheese added. GOUDA CHEESE- it was awesome. The burger was huge and they split it on to two plates for us when they brought it out. Everyone was really nice there. Our server was new and a bit slow to get to us but the manager (male with lighter brown hair) went out of his way to make sure our needs were met. We got the mango and watermelon yard-sized drinks and they were very good. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location as the service was pretty mediocre for the place being not-so-busy.    I started with the Parmesan Garlic Fries and Mac & Cheese Nom Noms.  Fries were a fail as the cheese wasn't freshly grated, it was straight powder - yuck.  The nom noms were pretty good so that's a pass.  I had the Dante burger which was decent.. but since the waiter wasn't interested in placing the correct orders with the correct people, I didn't enjoy it as much.  Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Dreadfully mediocre.  I don't think i've had a less flavorful burger anywhere, including at fast food joints.  We had a party of 6, so we were automatically charged the 18% gratuity despite the waiter forgetting my pepsi, and forgetting to have our garbage fries with no olives.  While the fries were decent (as well as the garlic fries, although the tater tots were just ok), everyone agreed that the burgers were very plain, especially given they range from $11 - 25.  The jalapenos on the Inferno weren't spicy at all, and the Standard doesn't even come with any sauce which makes the plain patty taste even more bland.    We came here because it was handy while we were staying at the Palazzo and didn't want to go far, but don't bother.  Walk somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped at Town Square to visit Old Navy, and the girlfriend and I ended up here for lunch. Prices seemed right, but the size of the burger was a little disappointing...   Ordered a chicken burger, fries, and a drink which was a few cents over $10. My girlfriend ordered a standard cheeseburger with an Oreo shake and HOLY SMOKES the shake was freaking AMAZING!! If I'm ever in the area, I'd come back just to get one again.   They don't have any hot sauce bottles on the tables, but I was happy the cashier was able to pull a Tabasco bottle from out back because my burger needed some flavor. My girlfriend's burger had no flavor and was pink in a few places... not really a fan of that.   Overall, some parts were really good, and others were just okay... still a pretty decent place for lunch if you're hungry and walking in the area."}
{"text":"Awh. My meal here was $27 and I got a hamburger and fries and a pop.  My friend and I could not agree on a place to eat, and by this time on our trip, tensions were running high between us. We compromised on I  Burgers. This was in the Palazzo, where we were doing some high end shopping and browsing.  I eat hamburger and fries a lot, and I was unimpressed by this high end place. I love going out to eat at nice places and am willing to spend the money, but this to me was not better quality than a Mcdonalds. (Which I hate) I wouldn't come here again. I understand that it is in the Palazzo, but I still don't see why the prices were so high.  It was just a hamburger and fries to me, but my friend did get a nice Tshirt here that brightened up the journey."}
{"text":"Great Bacon Burger!! Bacon, bacon mayo and bacon other things- so yummy!  The fried pickles really are the Best in the World (as they rightly advertise) There is dill in the batter that really puts them over the edge of delicious.  Blueberry alcoholic milkshake was good but I was too damn drunk and full to eat it... it sat in my hotel room for 2 days more in case you wanted to know how dirty I really can get...  Definitely a good spot for a decent, semi-inexpensive quick meal."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times before and looking for a not too pricey place for dinner in Town Square, we decided to eat here again on a Sunday night. I recall this place as a sort of hit and miss. My wife usually goes for the ILoveBacon burger and I try a different burger each time. I got the Caprese which had mozarella, portabella mushroom and balsamic reduction sauce. The burgers had potential except that the actual burger patties were dry and lacked flavor. Do not recall the burger being this unimpressive in the past. Anyway we love their fried pickles and the shakes are ok. Price is ok and kids eat free on Wed and Sat. Would probably try again."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Palazzo and ate here on our first night in town - it was horrible.  The hamburger was very dry and the buns were even worse - well no, the service was the worst!  There are other great burger places on the strip - don't waste your money like we did  - $40 for burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"When my wife and I walked in, we looked around and viewed a site that made our eyes perk and our mouths water. Designed in a mode that is cool, eclectic, and visual--you are taken on a quick pace to your table.  Once seated, the menu challenge begins.  I say that because of its diversity and taking the time to decide what you really want to order.  Scanning the menu--we both made our own decisions on what to try.  My wife ordered the Heart and Seoul Burger.  It is laden with a variety of items (avocado, kimchi, onion strings, a farm fresh fried egg, and furikake-wasabi-mayo) with its ground Angus marinated in Sriracha and soy sauces.  I, always having a traditional burger desire, received their Standard Angus Burger which had lettuce, tomato, onion, and Louie sauce.  Both burgers had brioche buns with the name \"I Love Burgers\" implanted in them.    Having been to Vancouver, and enjoyed them, we asked for Poutine Fries.  These are a delight within their own.  Golden french fries covered with brown gravy, mushrooms, and carmelized onions could have been a meal unto itself (we asked them to leave the cheese off since I am lactose intolerant).  For dessert, we had a piece of lavish chocolate fudge cake that ended our meal on a high sumptuous peak!!  Summary:  The burgers were truly a pure delight!!  My wife never once stopped eating hers and enjoyed every element of it.  Mine was one that could always be used to show how a traditional American hamburger should be cooked and created. I want to compliment their manager, Mark, for coming to check and see how things were going and our waitress, Ashley, who made sure everything was in place.  As a burger buff, I can say, if you love burgers, you will love \"I Love Burgers.\" The food, quality, service, and environment makes this a stop you will always want to hang out at when heading to Vegas (unlike gambling--every dollar you spend here guarantees to make you a culinary winner!!)"}
{"text":"Spiked milkshakes and deep fried pickles..AMAZING! Burgers are sooooo good :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the TVs to watch football... Unfortunately it was the same game on all the TVs.  No multitasking here.    The food is decent and there is a check in offer for a free order of Mac and Cheese Nom Noms so make sure to check in on Yelp!  We shared a I love bacon burger, garlic parmesan fries, and the mac and cheese nom noms today.  We really wanted to try the loco moco burger but that is sold only in the morning for breakfast.  Sad story.  Mac and cheese nom noms - mac and cheese deep fried somehow into a little cube.  Great for any mac and cheese lover.  Heavy though.  Garlic parm fries - soggy and greasy in my opinion... you can skip these.  I love bacon burger - great!  Loved the crispy onion in the center.  Nothing too crazy but it is a solid burger.  They even cut it for us so we didn't have to butcher it at our table.  I would definitely need to come back for the loco moco burger.  The next time I am awake early enough to eat a burger I will come here."}
{"text":"I echo Jared's comments earlier - the burgers here are ok, but certainly not worth the cost (although eating in Vegas is kinda always overpriced)... I had the Oregon Trail burger and it was your run of the mill cheeseburger (kudos on nailing the medium rare order request though!)... Basically everyone at the table felt the same - we did however enjoy the Parmesan Garlic fries (I'm not a huge fan of thin fries though, but the taste was good)...  Wouldn't come back to I Love Burgers since there is always so much else to try in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Well I started off with a tangerine beer.. It was tasty. Then I ordered the bison burger which was very tasty! It's not a huge burger but it's satisfying. I got on the side the truffle fries and fried pickles. The pickles are yummy and I really liked the dill dip it comes with. The truffle fries weren't the best I have ever had but they were not bad enough I didn't eat them believe me. Overall I would come here again! Plus bison burgers are hard to find and you can make any burger here with bison meat."}
{"text":"$30 gets you two sliders and two abysmal servings of fries. The taste didn't make up for it."}
{"text":"When you want a good ol burger they hit the spot. Menu says burgers Cooked medium unless otherwise requested. Mine was not medium but was very tasty. They \"brand\" the top of the roll with \"I love burgers\". When being seated we asked for a high top table, hostess said that they weren't seating at the high tops because they didn't have a server. Sat us two tables away from the high top...... Thinking that it would not have been a big deal to accommodate our request only two tables away....... Customer always right...l should never say no to a customer, especially when the request is reasonable. Our server, John was very good. $50 for 2 good size burgers, 2 diet sodas and tip...... It's Vegas......."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite to eat before our long night of partying started in Vegas.  This place has plenty of open space everywhere with a huge bar and TV's everywhere in the restaurant!! The customer service here was very nice and friendly and he kept checking up on us to make sure we were okay.  The food here was also delicious!! Plenty of ways you can dress up your burger to any way of your likings that particular day."}
{"text":"We have only eaten here once because of its location. It was good though! We ordered dishes to share; buffalo chicken sliders, kale citrus salad and fried pickles.  All were very good and gobbled up promptly.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Found this place by dumb luck and decided to give it a try!  A few weeks prior I had a fair dining experience at Burgers and Ribs so I was hoping that this place didn't follow suit.  I walked in and was immediately greeted by a nice girl with a welcoming smile. She assisted me with my order and gave me a number to put at my table.  Prices were a bit higher than expected but I did elect for some extras such as cheese, fried onions, and bacon.  In any case, the layout of the restaurant is strange. They had a few televisions tuned to the game but you had to pick certain seats and they were all taken. So from the seat I had, I couldn't watch the game.  Food was delivered quickly and I thought the size of the burger was bigger than average.  It was cooked a little longer than I would have liked it to be but it was still delicious. The fries were top notch as well.  I really wish this place would redesign the interior since the layout really inhibits my dining experience.  However, I definitely will return here next time I'm in the area.  I don't frequent Town Square too often due to the fact I don't live close by."}
{"text":"My friends and I were actually planning to try another burger place, but because of time constraints, decided to come here since it was convenient and located in our hotel (The Palazzo). It was pretty empty on a Monday afternoon, but there was a lot of staff working. Place is bright and fun..and relatively kid friendly in decor.   Our server was helpful when it came to recommendations. The staff overall was friendly and helpful. We didn't need to just speak to our server whenever we needed anything. Everyone was willing to help.   Food:  Nom Nom bites - macaroni cheese bites were lacking in flavor. Especially good cheese flavor. I say pass  I heart Bacon - good burger with bacon in the patty, more bacon on top and onion straws. Very tasty and was a good \"safe\" choice for me. Not the best burger I've had, but decent.  Garlic Parmesan Fries - DO NOT GET! I repeat...DO NOT GET unless you're expecting to raise your blood pressure by 100X! These were the saltiest batch of fries I've ever tasted. When I told the server they were reallyyy salty, he said it was because of the parm. Even after dusting the parm off, it was still as salty as table salt! My friend's plain fries were salty too. Someone must've spilled the salt all over the fries. Disgusting.  Bread pudding - yuck. but I'm not a bread pudding fan to start with so you can disregard this. I just found it to be a little hard than usual. It's served with ice cream, which was the best part about this dish.  Creme brulee - not worth it. I'd pass next time...if there is a next time.   Overall, this place isn't bad if you're looking for some grub. However, the burgers aren't something you'll be raving about when you're home. Pricey, but whatevs, it's Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden in Town Square - good atmosphere and prices. It's a cool place to take your kids for burger and shake night :)"}
{"text":"A very laid back atmosphere and fun staff.. Food is outstanding from salads (especially salmon choice) & burgers (quality) enjoy the TV's everywhere Especially during football season. Overall the decor, food, staff, atmosphere is awesome! Love it here!"}
{"text":"This place is the best; every time I stay at the Palazzo or Venetian I come here at least once a day.  Breakfast is my favorite; even back in Jersey I had never seen such a beautiful breakfast sandwich.  Pancakes are also great.  The few times I've been in this trip, the Manager Mark took care of me.  He really goes out of his way to make people feel welcomed.  I really thought he owned the place, cause he speaks of this place with such pride and you don't see people taking pride much in their place of employment anymore.  This afternoon I'll be on the convention floor talking about this place to all my friends, and I know none of the will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sorry, this place doesn't even live up to the Burgers at Grand Lux. Burger Bar is way better too IMO. The server was a really nice guy though."}
{"text":"So not good. So not worth $17. I know it's the Strip and I expect prices to be high, even for casual food and I'm fine with that, but if you charge $17 for a burger there's a minimum expectation that should be met. Like maybe it should be served hot. Even though my burger was served medium rare, it was so dry I had to pile on more mayo to get any flavor at all. The outside was way over-charred, the inside was a red/pink color that I've never seen in a burger. I always eat my burgers medium rare, so I know what they should look/taste like. When you cut into a medium rare burger there should be some juice - usually it's dripping down your hands. Not here - not so much as a drop, just a weird color that makes me wonder what they're adding to the meat. And it wasn't hot, barely room-temp warm. I got the I Love Bacon burger which had very little bacon or any other flavor (supposedly a \"blend\" of brisket and bacon, so maybe that's why the color was odd?). The \"crisp\" bacon described on the menu was soggy. The bacon mayo had no bacon flavor (I actually opened the burger to see if they'd even put any on). So basically I got a barely-warm, bland burger for $17. I also ordered garlic parm fries - again, barely warm, kinda chewy, they'd definitely been sitting around a while. Definitely out of a bag, not hand cut or anything that I've normally seen at high-end burger places (at least the ones who care about putting out good quality product). That was another $7 and not worth it, I only ate a few of them. McDonalds has better fries. The side of garlic mayo that came with the fries did come in handy to put on the burger.   Here's my theory on how they make the burgers - pre-formed patties that are slightly pre-cooked. Then they stick them in the fridge. When you order, they toss them on the grill again to warm them up. That's the only thing I could think of that  would explain the temp of the burger and the overly-charred exterior. And the super-dry texture.   I really regret not sending it all back and asking for the food to be served hot, as it should be. But I was tired and hungry and just wanted to eat and move on. Bottom line - save your money, go elsewhere. Even the Johnny Rockets in the Grand Canal Shops serves up a better burger and fries. And for less.   I will say my server was pleasant and efficient. That's the only good thing I can say about the place."}
{"text":"The food was quite good, albeit a bit overpriced. My disappointment stems from being charged $3 for \"rocks\" in my whiskey drink....Really?"}
{"text":"I am torn between 2 stars and 3. The first time we came here, we got nom noms (yum!) and fried pickles( yay!) and a the caprese burger. We all really enjoyed our meal...so we went back again. First of all, the food took a really really long time.  I got the veggie burger. ZOMG this was food that made me literally want to gag. It tasted like flour and I mean that in the very worst way possible.Worst Veggie Burger EVER.  I sent it back and got a salad. This also took a long time, though the salad was very tasty.  BF got sick from his burger on this visit. Though I suppose greasy food might = you takes your chances.  I suppose I'd go for a third try. But it seems hit or miss.  Extra half star for having a very decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite burgers in Vegas now...  I've already gone about 5 times, and intend to go many more.  So why only 4 stars?  Well...  The service has been pretty slow at times and they've fallen flat on a few items.  So... a summary of my experiences...    Mac and Cheese nom noms - Eat with caution!  Crisp panko breading on the outside, deep fried, and then served blistering hot.  If you're in an evil mood, you can not warn your friends and then laugh heartily while they burn their tongues on the oozing cheese!  Ho ho ho, you nom nom noob!  Mozarella Fries - Obviously the waitress had no idea how to explain these things, because I was expecting something totally different.  The short?  They're mozarella sticks.  The long?  They're REALLY GOOD, thick mozarella sticks, the marinara is wonderful, and the cheese was obviously extremely high quality.  Triple Truffle Fries - Taste like dirt!  But yummy dirt!  What would normally be called a shoestring fry (more on this next) tossed with truffle oil, and slivers of what appear to be real truffle oil.  Don't ask me what the third truffle is, I don't think anyone actually knows.  If you like truffles, this is a good choice.    Shoestring fries - What normally passes as a shoestring fry can only sob at their own gross obesity compared to these...  We got a huge mound of these incredibly THIN fries.  They were like nothing I'd ever seen before, and really tasty....  Definite recommend.  New York Style chips - The first time I had them, they were out of this world.  Crisp, thick cut fresh potato chips.  The next time I had them, they sucked.  They were even thinner, but somehow lacked any semblance of crispness and were just soggy and cold and reminiscent of a bag of Lays that's been sitting out in the rain.  Very disappointed.  I'll try them again, but be careful.  I'll ask for well done next time.    So on to the burgers -   Caprese Burger - One of my two favorites...  INCREDIBLE mix of flavors from the freshly ground beef, to the thick fresh slices of melted buffalo mozarella, and thick slices of beefsteak tomato.    Add on the basil aioli and balsamic reduction...  and it's a whole range of flavours at one time.  Taking a queue from, but definitely not to be mistaken for a Caprese salad, this surprisingly refreshing burger will still sit in your stomach like a pile of bricks when you're done (not in a bad way).  It's a lot of food, and well worth the price.  Ahi burger - My second favorite, this \"burger\" is basically sushi in disguise!  Lightly seared to keep the tuna fresh and rare in the center, it packs a spicy kick AND a wasabi twist.  Loaded with tomato and lettuce on a sweet taro bun, it's just fantastic.  The only thing that could make this perfect burger even better would be a some avocado... and you can add it (for an extra $2)!  A bit pricy at $17, but despite being just fish it is just as filling as a regular burger and hey...  sushi isn't cheap either!  Dante burger - Hmm... The most disappointing of all the burgers, it still wasn't bad.  For me, I guess it lacked the \"fresh produce\" flavors.  It came without lettuce or tomato and was just too heavy for my tastes.  Caramelized onions, a big beef patty, and bleu cheese.  Great for the caveman, but I want to at least PRETEND that there's something healthy about my burger!  The food is really top notch, the burgers pricey but worthwhile, and the fries and appetizers are VERY reasonably priced.  Kick up the service a bit, and it's the best burger place ever!"}
{"text":"The food was fairly priced. I did enjoy the setting.  It was open, sunny and not too loud.    I'd have given it more, but the service was a bit slow, and then one our dishes, a Chicken burger, was over cooked.  It felt like I was chewing on a piece of rubber.    I'll skip the chicken next time."}
{"text":"Great Service! The heart and soul burger! Yum yum yum! Siracha infused beef, avocado, sunny side up egg, Kimchee! I exnayed on kimchee but it was still amazing! Yummy Fresh shakes! Strawberry yum!   We were in a rush and they catered to our needs! Def coming back! I wonder if they have happy hour?"}
{"text":"Omggg ... Where do I began :/ the place was real empty. That should of been a sign not to go in. Service was horrible only seen the order taker once . The food was even worst the burger had no flavor what so ever . The fries tasted like air, it had made me gag ! Will not be going back. So disappointed"}
{"text":"I'm shocked that this place has such a low average. I really liked it! It's better than Burger Bar.  We ate here on our first day at Palazzo. I had the caprese burger, which had plenty of gooey fresh mozzarella, crispy fried basil and balsamic vinegar. My fiancé had the I Heart Bacon Burger, which is scientifically proven to be the most bacon-y food product in the entire universe. It began with a hamburger patty that had chopped up bacon mixed in with the beef and was smothered in bacon mayo and a billion strips of thick-cut bacon. The only thing that wasn't full of bacon was the cheese (I think this should be remedied).  We had the truffle fries, which I thought were good but a little lacking in truffle flavor until I tried the truffle aioli, which was DELICIOUS. (I am a truffle maniac.) Overall, it's a little expensive but the restaurant is cute, the selection is inventive and the food is good. Yum!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas for a few days and stopped in at I Love Burgers for a low key dinner the other night. My mom ordered the Dante Burger with turkey instead of Angus beef (they substituted,  no questions). My friend ordered the Mediterranean salad, and it looked delicious!  I ordered the Wedge salad and a side of tater tots (amazing!). The salad was tasty and the tater tots were fantastic, especially with ranch. For dessert we had a piece of Chocolate Fudge Cake (yum!) and a piece of Bananas Foster Cheesecake. The cheesecake was so good and the perfect way to end our meal.  Leon was our server...he was friendly, attentive and an overall awesome guy! If I lived closer to LV, I'd go back to I Love Burgers for his good service alone. Thank you Leon, for adding to my memorable Las Vegas experience!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Good. Decent. Personally, not a fan of sweetened sweet potato fries; they sprinkle cinnamon on them. The burgers are typically smaller in size, however a good portion. They were just a bit on the drier side; we saw one of the cooks pressing down on the patty while it was cooking; ok grill master says you NEVER do that! It let's out all of the juiciness!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this a 2 stars is because of their delicious salmon burger.  Other than that, the service sucked, portions were extremely small, a 15$ salad only included lettuce, cucumbers and shredded carrots. The fries ordered were soggy and also small portion.  Overall very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was decent. My only issue is the prices. You're getting restaurant prices in a fast food type setting. And they took forever to get us our food. There were only 2 of us and a group who had ordered after we did with 4 people got their food before we did. I probably won't waste my time going there again."}
{"text":"This place should be called \"I Love Cold Food\". From beginning to end this place wasn't good. I thought it being at Palazzo that it would be great but from the host ignoring us to the waiter with no personality, I wouldn't go here again. All of our food was cold and looked like it was reheated then given to us, we sent it back but waiting already too long in the first place made our appetites disappear. If u want a good burger place go to BLT Burger at Mirage or Holstein's at Cosmopolitan hotel."}
{"text":"The atmosphere screams fast food but the burgers, shakes (get them spiked!) and fries are great! (4 stars). I recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the I Heart Bacon sliders, which has the highlight of gouda, bacon, and fried shallots. I got 3 little sliders that surprisingly kept me full until 4 am (with dancing) when dinner was at 9 pm.  But 3 stars for the tiny little glass of merlot for $8 (c'mon, it's Vegas)"}
{"text":"Came here after doing some shopping with my girlfriend.  We got a bacon burger, barbecue burger, fries, and tater tots.  Interesting setting, lots of TVs around, and everyone was pretty friendly.  It took just a tad bit too long to get our food but they do state they cook everything to order and it takes 8-10 minutes so we were warned.   The burgers are 1/3 lb and thick but small in terms of diameter (think like 2-3 standard McDonalds hamburger patties stacked on top of each other).  The quality of the beef was good, but they were dry burgers.  I don't mind getting a medium steak, but when it comes to burgers it has to be well done.  Still, almost every well done burger I've had from fast food to casual to upscale steakhouses has not been this dry.  The fries and tater tots were very good.  Even the regular size version of either is enough for 2 people.    Overall I'm happy about some things and unhappy about others.  I think paying $8-$10 for a burger of that size/quality is off-putting.  I'd rather pay 25-50% of the price for almost any fast food burger.  If they could pull off a casual burger like TGI Friday's or Applebee's for the same price then this would probably be a 5-star review (and I'd be talking about how great a deal it was).    That said, the fries & tater tots were great, and it is a relatively inexpensive place to eat compared to others in Town Square, which is appreciated."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I work in town square and find myself picking up their oh so delicious nom noms quite frequently. the staff are always friendly towards regulars and newcomers when I come in. I've also had their burgers before, which are pretty good! they are very flavorful and pair great with the toasted bun. I do wish it came with fries, but you can't win them all. haha"}
{"text":"Stopped at I love Burgers while walking inside the Palazzo. Food options are pretty steep inside the Palazzo so this is one of the more reasonable options. I had the Caprese burger and enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was special but it was tasty and they actually cooked it medium rare which apparently is pretty hard to do at many places. I didn't try one but I liked that they had spiked milkshakes. Space-wise it's pretty spacious so good for a larger group."}
{"text":"My hangover cure in Vegas.  Make sure you have an appetite before you show up. The parm fries are a MUST.  The I love bacon burger is my favorite, although it might give you a mini heart attack during the day.  One recommendation I have is if you have two people, splitting the Ultimate Cheeseburger (with two patties) is the perfect amount.  Unfortunately didn't get to try any of their special drinks, but that's next time!"}
{"text":"Let me break this into a couple of categories to understand the lower rating as it is a good restauarant:  Price - This is the main reason for 3 stars.  3 burgers, 2 milk shakes and an order of fried pickles came out to $57 dollars.  when a milk shake is $6 and its served in a 8 oz plastic cup its way overpriced.  Food - Burgers and fries were good, but there are a lot of good burger joints in town with many of them cheaper than here.  Location - Yes its in Town Square, but unless you are going to Valet Parking in the back its hard to find. Its behind Yardhouse and it almost seems like an overflow for when Yardhouse is full. We went on a Saturday evening at 6pm and we were the only table in the joint.  a few folks started walking in right when we were leaving.  Decor - Cool chalkboard paint on the walls so everyone is encouraged to draw but nothing that made it stand out.   Overall -  We would go back again since we are at Town Square quite often, but probably would need a groupon."}
{"text":"Came here 25 min before my lunch break was over to order Parmesan fries to go. Was given a menu very quickly and promptly told the bartender this is what I wanted so I can clock in from lunch and walk back to work asap.  I didn't get my fries until 30 MIN LATER!!! What was even more insulting was that my food was sitting on the counter next to the register the ENTIRE time and the bartender didn't apologize AT ALL for not giving me my food. I saw someone from the kitchen bring out a plastic bag but I didn't assume it was mine considering I placed my order just 5 min prior. Turns out, my food was in that bag!!! When I pointed out to him how my food was sitting at the counter the entire time, he didn't care and proceeded to get me hot fries. No empathy, no concern at all for wasting my time and making me late from my lunch break! He was annoyed he had to go and fetch me hot fries, but if he had done his damn job he wouldn't have had to do that! The bartender must have thought since I'm on my phone, I won't notice the bad service! Too bad for him I noticed he wasn't very busy and was only tending to two other people on a far from overwhelmed Wednesday afternoon! If I wasn't running late for work, I would have requested to speak to a manager and get my money back as well as an apology! But unlike them, I have class and I refused to make my coworker go to lunch even later just because of me.   Not getting an apology was the straw that broke the camel's back for me! More than letting my food grow cold and not giving it to me right away. The lack of apology shows me they're too proud to admit when they're wrong. Never again!"}
{"text":"They had a facebook promotion for a free classic burger so I decided to give this place a shot. Walked in and was greeted by the general manager. He was very kind as was the girl who took my order. I added on some \"Nom Noms\" which were mac n cheese balls that were fried. The food was pretty quick maybe ten or fifteen minutes and considering the place was pretty busy that seemed pretty impressive. The burger itself looked absolutely amazing. The bun was a beautiful golden brown and looked as if it was baked on location and to order. The patty was a nice medium rare which is just how I like it. Perhaps I am spoiled a little bit by In-and-Out and their toasted buns and super fresh and crunchy veggies. I was really missing it with this burger. The bun was super soft and doughy and although it had a thin layer of lettuce and tomato I just didn't get any crunch or texture out of it. The patty was decent but I just wasn't tasting anything special. The cheese was a nice visual but offered nothing in terms of flavor. As for the nom noms... they were pretty tasty. Primarily because of the cheese dipping sauce. I wish they had given me enough to use on my burger. I guess the bottom line with this place is if you are in Town Square and want a burger for 6 bucks then go for it. It wont blow you away but it will hold you over compared to a lot of the expensive places located near by.   Good Service, good quality, lacks any type of wow factor though. For 6 bucks you get a classic burger which is a single patty with cheese, lettuce and tomato.   Personally I will be sticking to in and out for burgers and Yard House (Happy Hour) for Town Square dining."}
{"text":"So many great places to eat in Las Vegas, let alone just inside the Venetian and Palazzo hotels, and this is not one of them. For a casual sit-down place this would not be my restaurant of choice.   We were left feeling very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I was staying at the Venetian for a Medical conference. After the last day I got hungry and did not want to go to a fancy sit down, so decided to give this place a try. The entire place was empty. This is a fairly large restaurant. I ordered a Chicken Burger, Onion rings and a diet coke. The total came out to $28.00. We are talking about a place like Habit Burger. I got sick after eating at this place and strongly feel I should get a refund. I hate to write negative reviews, but this place can not get even two stars from me. I understand its inside the Venetian, so the rent will be higher thus the prices will be substantially more than a regular place, but there is no excuse for bad product, especially when you charge $28.00 with tax. I will not comeback to this place. With sadness this place gets my first ever one star review on Yelp. I would think 100 times before coming back. The waitress was nice, but never checked up on us to see if everything was ok."}
{"text":"Okay, the staff is great but i expected better burgers. Although we got sliders and not burgers, I still assumed they would have been just as good, but they were decent. The fries and mozzarella sticks were better. The staff was nice and there are $4 beer during happy hour. That's all I got to say about that."}
{"text":"Greasy burgers. The bottom of the bun was soaked. All three of our orders cam this way. We showed our server the buns and he said that  Angus beef is very \"juicy!\" Friendly guy but obviously didn't take notice to our complaint. We gave him 20% anyway.  Very expensive lunch. 3 burgers with some fixin's, a spiked milkshake, sweet potato fries and a diet coke came to $81.00 with tax and tip. $3.50 for the diet pepsi? Wow!"}
{"text":"Expect to pay at least $20 per burger, but you are in Vegas so no surprise there. The burgers were good and so were the drinks, pretty strong too. Other than it being super expensive and the burgers being good, there is nothing really outstanding about this place. Only 3 star worthy."}
{"text":"My besties and I came here a couple of days ago because we wanted a quick bite for lunch.  We were trying for a more inexpensive option since dinners was going to be pricey but we failed at that attempt.  Space was nice and open and felt like a burger joint but the price point was a bit high.  They had football on which is always nice.  Seventeen bucks for a bacon burger which came out dry with a dab of the bacon mayo that I could not even taste. Expected more from the burger- also they say they cook to medium but clearly it was closer to well. No pink in sight.  Parmesan garlic fried did not taste like garlic at all and came out limp.  Even though they are typically my far, I think I liked the regular fries better.  Milkshakes (spiked and un spiked) were pretty good- bumping them up to 2 star status.  I appreciated the to go cup for my caramel corn spiked goodness.   While our server was very nice, it took forever to order, and worse yet to pay the bill.  It was busy in the restaurant so management might want to consider having extra staff on hand on a Saturday.  Since this is the last experience in a restaurant it can really leave a bad taste in your mouth. With plenty of other choices in Vegas, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Burgers are cooked to order! Food was great! The place was fun & trendy... Workers there are nice & helpful! Slightly pricey but it's worth it! Def recommend!"}
{"text":"The Tahitian Vanilla shakes are divine on all levels, the burgers are decadent and the Nom Nom's are Yum Yum! :)"}
{"text":"I came here again with clients on a Sunday afternoon and once again I was disappointed. There were 8 of us and we ordered a beer. At first, only 7 beers came out. Additionally, many of the brews were presented as something else, a few presentations were comically bad as when our server stated that a glass held an IPA when it was clearly a dark brown ale. My beer came out last, after I had to remind her of my order.  Passing out the burgers was less muddled, but only because a different server just called out the burger and we raised our hands. We also ordered the World's Best Fried Pickles which is two words two long because there was nothing about them that made them the \"world's best,\" they were simply fried pickles. Also, the fried pickle \"appetizer\" came out AFTER all of our burgers. The only plus, and the only reason I added one star to the review was that I had the Heart and Seoul burger which was actually quite tasty. The avocado and kim chi gave the burger a distinct flair. Avoid this place if you can, but if you must, sit at the bad and know that at least the Heart and Seoul burger is good."}
{"text":"Rolled in here at 10:26am with 10 girls for Bachelorette party breakfast, and the host told us they were no longer serving breakfast! Checked their menu, and it said \"Breakfast until 10:30am.\" So we asked the host to ask the kitchen staff if they would still do breakfast for us since it was a special occasion, and they said Yes!  Tall Glasses of water came out right as we were seated Fresh Orange Juice - not too sweet or pulpy, and tasted like real oranges Hot Tea came with a choice from a variety that they had in stock Coffee was piping hot and strong Bloody Mary came out delicious with a piece of fried bacon instead of celery Loco Moco - Hawaiian style cooked to order burger patty with gravy over a bed of rice, came with a side of kimchee - served in a skillet -- SPOT ON, yummy! even better with some extra sriracha Heart and Seoul - Sriracha angus beef patty cooked to order over a bed of fried rice, came with a side of kimchee - served in a skillet -- REALLY GOOD Wagyu Kobe - Beef patty cooked to order on a bed of spinach, garnished with fried onions, crispy tater tots, salty fried prociutto, and a side of kimchee -- Good, but not thrilling  Manager came out to greet us. All the food came out at the same time. Everyone pretty much finished their plate. Bill was around $16 a person.  Would definitely recommend this as a great place for breakfast or lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Service: above Average Decor: bizarre and really interesting Food: I had a memorable burger; nice thick patty.  Very good beer selection which every gastropub or burger bar should have. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch because it seemed to be the only restaurant in the Palazzo shops that wasn't a fancy sit down dinner type of place.  We just wanted something quick and easy.  The menu has a wide variety of burgers, hot dogs, milkshakes, and everything that would be fitting for a burger joint.  The atmosphere is also very fitting and looks almost 50's style.  The service was good as was the food but everything was overpriced.    My burger was $16 for a BBQ burger and my husband got a traditional hamburger with an additional bleu cheese topping for $15.  I think the burgers were as good as ones you'd get at Red Robin, but these prices do not include fries.  You'll have to pay an extra $7 per person if you want that.  But the fries or tator tots come large and you can order one and share it with someone.  We got the tator tots and they were excellent.  We also tried the appetizer called fried macaroni nom noms.  They are7 small bite sized cubes.   Inside the cubes are 2 or 3 pieces of macaroni and it's served with cheese sauce.  They tasted good but for $6 it was overpriced.  There was no wait and it wasn't crowded so if we were at the Palazzo and really wanted a burger we might stop in again."}
{"text":"I'm here at happy hour and lucky fir me they honor the prices on labor day!!! I'm sitting here with the fried Mac n cheese bites along side the fried pickles and the killer look aid! ! The killer look aid is made is made with smarter, vodka,  midori on top. Yum Yum Yum!! The plus is that it is at my favorite location in town, Town Square!!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and nearby, eat here. If you have a pursuit for delectable food, don't.  I had the Inferno, which was certainly the item on the menu that I am best suited at critiquing. Luckily, the jalapeños and spicy mayo were able to overpower the dull bun and unseasoned ground beef patty.  The pickle that accompanied my hardly palatable burger was shriveled.  Service was almost inexistent for me. Upon entering, nobody was at the podium so I sat at the bar. A girl greeted me and handed me a menu. I ordered a water and never received it, nor could I capture her attention to place my order.  I found this to be an opportune time to use the restroom facilities, which are tucked in the far back and lack signage.  Upon my return I moved to a different seat at the bar and another gentleman greeted me and I again order a water. He quickly turned around and I gave my order for the Inferno Burger to his back as he was typing it in.  All in all, I won't come back here unless I'm hungry and need something quick, because the burger actually did come out rather fast after the order was placed."}
{"text":"I don't know where all these negative reviews are coming from, but I just had an amazing I Love Bacon Burger... It was cooked perfectly and the service was great. Finish off with some deep fried oreos and you are set for the night!"}
{"text":"I got the garbage fries and chicken tenders during happy hour and it was super cheap! It was like 4 dollars each and they gave a lot. The garbage fries were hugeee and were so goood , especially when I saved them for late night munchies! They also gave a lot of chicken tenders for the happy hour price.  I dont think i would pay full price for these items because it wasn't the best and if you could get it for half off why would you ever pay regular price?!"}
{"text":"too lazy to drive anywhere else to eat, my friend and i decided to just grab a burger here. wasnt that bad, but it wasnt that great either. it was just sufficient  what i ate: - fried mac and cheese nom noms (FREE): due to my trusty yelp app we got this appetizer for FREE! (yay for free!) this was definitely tasty, but seriously, how can you mess up deep fried cheesy stuff?? while very tasty, i couldnt bring myself to have more than two. sigh, i really should have stopped at the first piece, but i couldnt help myself, i was just too hungry.  - wagyu kobe burger: tasty, but it was not worth the price! seriously, opt for one of the other burgers. don't be swayed by the idea of a having a \"wagyu kobe\" burger! have that at your local steakhouse where the price will be justifiable. also, without the sauce (comes on the side), the burger isnt that amazing. the sad part about it is that the truffle flavor gets overpower and drowned out by the sauce, but without the sauce the burger is pretty unremarkable. so, to keep yourself from being caught in this delimna just order something else! - dante burger: sauteed mushrooms, om nom nom. the blue cheese was the perfect pungent partner to the savory mushrooms. i loved eating this - parm garlic fries: very tasty and garlicy. the parm gave it a nice salty bite. nice size to share - bloody mary: spicy, peppery, delightful.  pros: - loud fun atmosphere. very sports bar themed - large space, so plenty of room for large parties or small - dante burger was very tasty, as were the fries - there wasnt much of a wait when we strolled in at lunch time on a sunday afternoon.   cons: - service: she was there, and then she wasnt. for a very long time. we ordered drinks, and boom, they were the LAST things that arrived. stranger still was that the manager (i think she was the manager) brought one drink out, and then stopped by again towards the end of the meal to ask about my drink. while she got my drink, she didnt apologize, didnt comp us, didnt say anything! also, my friend ordered a dirty martini that was supposed to come out with olives stuffed with blue cheese. when he pointed out they were just regular olives, she just sent over a ramekin of blue cheese. w t f ??? POOR SERVICE. - slow: as i said before it took damn near forever for my bloody mary to arrive, longer still for food to start arriving  would i come again? no."}
{"text":"Walk in, order and pay.    You build your burger to order, pick your toppings and sides.  They give you a number and cook your food to order.  The sandwiches and shakes were great!"}
{"text":"Best little Bar in Town Square... Ok I know it's a burger joint and the grilled BBQ chicken salad w/ extra chicken is FANTASTIC! BUT I love to go for drinks, the weekend bar tender always tosses together an array of creative shooters! Ask for the BAZOOKA! She created a speciality drink just for us :) delicious"}
{"text":"It was good but not $19 for one baby burger and one baby salad good. Dante burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli was a winner but I wasn't overwhelmed. Ahi tuna salad was alright too, with a large piece of fish, but again, nothing overwhelming. Also, $6 for a milkshake? Does it provide healing properties and is it made of gold? No? Okay nevermind then, I'll just drink water.   The place is kind of hidden in Town Square and seems to be suffering... Lots of flags in the Las Vegas Boulevard entrance advertising it as well as a chalk drawing asking satisfied customers to Yelp them.   The service was okay but again, nothing overwhelming. The clerk at the front was the only really memorable experience. She asked if I had any questions about the menu and delivered service with a smile.   I would probably be willing to try it again if it wasn't so expensive. Groupon perhaps?"}
{"text":"I was here while on vacation and I must say this place was made just for me. Burgers... Gooood. Beer!! Goooood!! Over 55 beers, from local breweries to classy imports. I got the I love bacon n egg sliders. 3 black angus sliders with bacon, onion strings,bacon mayo, gouda and fried quail egg = Absolute perfection!! Also, if you get their 32oz souvenir cup you can come back all day(with receipt) and refill it with anything you want for half price... and I mean anything(they also have a full bar). Our server Tracee was the shit!! Coolest person I think I have ever met at a restaurant, and I've been to a lot of restaurants. Funny, down to earth, and just an overall genuine person. Tracee you ROCK!! Aside from it being a little messy and the decor a bit confusing, this place was seriously one of the highlights of my trip. Wish there was one in San Diego..."}
{"text":"Located downstairs of the Palazzo, very convenient. The food here was OK, but I expected a little more.   We had just arrived to Vegas and got our room. Saw a coupon for this place so we gave it a try, and plus it was quick and cheap. There is a to-go window right outside of the restaurant so we decided to pick up some food and eat in our suite.   We had the tater tots (can't go wrong with that), the short rib sliders (not that great) and my boyfriend just had a regular burger. Food was not that great, but they are opened until midnight!"}

{"text":"Winding down a great trip to Vegas, we stopped here for lunch on the way back to the airport.  The menu is full of items I want to try.  I settled for:  Bacon BBQ Burger, $16 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-burgers-las-vegas?select=MchRrYzyVaq2GS1o5YHzBw#MchRrYzyVaq2GS1o5YHzBw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-burgers-las-vegas?select=fbKh1oDkptT-Hre343bLqg#fbKh1oDkptT-Hre343bLqg  Fried Pickles, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-burgers-las-vegas?select=wrSi0xR004uKJMdWNgje-Q#wrSi0xR004uKJMdWNgje-Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-burgers-las-vegas?select=0cbEu0kP4czyUHG_ZRGTXQ#0cbEu0kP4czyUHG_ZRGTXQ  Fried Mac 'n Cheese, $6 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-burgers-las-vegas?select=S0kywFjfzMvrsHe1tBrAsQ#S0kywFjfzMvrsHe1tBrAsQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/i-love-burgers-las-vegas?select=UBNwWJK4P0t-Qd3DqgYZTg#UBNwWJK4P0t-Qd3DqgYZTg  The Fried Pickles were *meh*, nothing to really speak of....the Breading was bland & lacked flavor.  The Fried Mac 'n Cheese was awesome.  If I could make these at home, I'd make a whole bowl of them and eat them while watching a game.    The Bacon BBQ Burger was pretty good.....$16 good?  Nah, but it was good.  I understand that it's the Strip and prices would be high, but for $16 at a place called \"I Love Burgers\", I was expecting to be blown away.  That said, I'll come back again and will try a few more menu items, it's that interesting to me.  We dined at the bar and the service was really good.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I was craving burgers one day and I remembered that I Love Burgers was on my bookmarks and how one of my friends used to talk about this place a lot, so I decided to come here for lunch... Located in Town Square, I Love Burgers offers a good selection of made-to-order burgers with some original creations on their menu that are worth taking a look at.   The interior was clean, and despite it being a little busy for the lunch rush, there was plenty of seating left. I also liked the chalkboard walls, which made it easy for my group and I to embrace our inner child and start doodling away while we waited for our food!  I had the Oregon Trail burger, which according to the menu, consisted of: ground buffalo, aged cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onions, and a roasted garlic aioli all between whole wheat buns.   When my burger came, I was actually a little surprised at how small the patty was (even the tomato looked bigger than the actual burger patty)! Whatever... the aroma was tantalizing my senses so I just wanted to dig in!  The burger was cooked to a medium, so it really is juicy and filled with the savory flavor of the lean buffalo. The bun tasted a little dry, but I wasn't sure if the bun being whole wheat was what made it taste that way. The juiciness of the burger made up for the dry burger buns, so it wasn't that bad.  The sweet potato fries were not burnt and they have the perfect sweetness to make my tastebuds happy. I feel like they give you a lot of fries, but maybe the size of the burger makes the fries look like a bigger portion.  I like the little branding of the restaurant name on top of the burger bun (nice touch!). However, it wasn't enough to completely win me over.   From a place that specializes in burgers, I expected something more. I don't know if it was worth it because the burgers left me underwhelmed.  I Love Burgers, I dub thee... average."}
{"text":"Greasy burger, fries were both burned and soggy (can't figure that one out), and while we were waiting for out food next to me in the seats at their counter we had to witness whom I'm assuming is some sort of manager keep walking by an applicant waiting to be interviewed by her and she kept telling him \"I'll be with you shortly\" while talking loudly on her cell phone taking a personal call. We thought it was SOOO rude, especially when she started the interview and then stopped int he middle to take another call on her cell from her mother. This poor guy was very gracious about it but my hubby and I thought it was just so incredibly rude and tacky. We each had a cocktail and split a burger and fries as it was late in the day, and our bill was close to $40 so its a bit pricey. Bartender was friendly though and made great conversation."}
{"text":"A group of us stayed at the Palazzo for a trade show and saw these awesome pictures of burgers from this place.  After being at a trade show for 3 days, I was hankering for some white rice.  They have Loco Moco!! YAY!  The Poutine fries, Garbage fries, and fried Mac and Cheese were gooood.  The fried mac and cheese are these bits of fried squares of creamy goodness.  Also had the fried pickles.  Wasn't to excited about these.  They sliced the pickles lengthwise and the batter was greasy and not much flavor.  My co-workers like their burgers.  There were 6 of us so I don't remember what they ordered.  I got the Loco Moco and was disappointed.  I ordered it medium rare.  The burger was cooked on too high of heat too fast cause the edges were hard and dry and only a tiny piece was medium rare.  The rice... there bunch of crunchy pieces... yah.... hard rice... not good....  My coworker had the red velvet cheese cake.  There was the crust,  then there is a layer of red velvet cake and then cheese cake on top.  He really liked it.  I got the banana fosters cheese cake.  Is it worth the calories?  Only if there wasn't an ice cream place around.   1 star for the fried mac and cheese 1 star for the server who was quick and efficient (he knew we had to catch a flight) 1 star for the Poutine and Garbage fries"}
{"text":"I Love Burgers is located in the Palazzo.  My friends and I were wandering through the mall around 10:45 in the evening and smelled the burger aroma from way down the hallway.  We thought we'd grab a burger since they smelled so good.  The restaurant was happy to seat us, but we noticed that the kitchen staff was cleaning up the grills.  We discovered that they were closing in a few minutes so we decided to not be the douchey people that come in at closing time and keep everyone way late.    We returned the next evening at an appropriate dinner time and ordered some food.  We started off with an order of the garbage fries.  This is a plate of fries drenched in buffalo chili, jalapenos, green onion, cilantro, olives and cheese sauce.  I'm not the biggest fan of olives or jalapenos so I picked them off my portion.  The fries were decent and hit the spot because I was starving.  I always order a plain jane burger at burger places because I use that to judge whether I like the burgers there or not.  Typically the fancy burgers mask the taste of the actual meat with all the extra hoopla going on.  I ordered the Standard (lettuce, tomatoes, onion) with American cheese.  I have to say that the burger was mediocre at best.  The beef itself had not flavor at all.  I'm not sure that they put any seasoning on it.  It was supposed to arrive medium but this was cooked closer to well done.  I also got an order of the parmesan garlic fries.  These were pretty tasty until you got to the bottom 1/3 of the fries and discover that the remaining fries are completely drenched in grease.  I had better burgers at White Castle and In N Out on this same Vegas visit."}
{"text":"We ordered a black bean burger, fried Mac n cheese, grilled cheese and cheese fries. Everything was okay but the fried Mac n cheese was the best part."}
{"text":"I eat at I love burgers about 2-3 times a week since I work at town square and they offer a generous discount for employees. Some items are a little pricey compared to fast food but I don't consider this a fast food joint. It is more of a fast casual diner. You get grass fed beef for a reasonable price. I have bought grass fed beef at whole foods, so I know it is not cheap.   I am always greeted by the employees when I come in. In fact Sandra who works the register knows me by name and knows what I like to order. She always gives me great service. The managers always come by and ask how my meal was and if there was anything else. I see that they care about providing great service and food. I am sure if I had a problem or suggestion they would take it seriously. Hence why they are always reading yelp reviews.   I have had pretty much everything on the menu. My go to is the BBQ chicken salad. The BBQ burger is good. The caprice is a very good burger if you are tired of the same old burger every other place offers. The biggest surprise I found was the turkey burger, it comes with some really tasty stuffing. If I was a beer drinker I am sure I would be here more with the beer specials they have here."}
{"text":"Since we love burgers, the name of the place drawed us in. We ordered sliders and loco moco. The sliders was good. The loco moco, not so much! With the name, I love burger, you would expect the burgers to be close to perfect.  Our server Maria was excellent!"}
{"text":"Left Vegas and ended up at a mall called Townsquare. I had no idea where I was going and ended up parking in a weird parking spot by vallet and saw this place. The name and outside was so cute and as soon as I saw \"shakes and beer\" I had to go in. When I went in I saw 2 other customers and a very flustered manager I would assume at the register. I only ordered a shake because it looked like a storm was moving in and I had a long drive back to California. I ordered the Triple Chocolate Shake which was over $5. I instantly thought of a quote from Pulp Fiction. Anyway I sat down and waited for my shake. The manager was very all over the place she was in the middle of taking someone's order and an employee came in and she went straight into conversation with her and totally left the customer waiting. Behind the counter where my shake should have been made no one was doing anything. The waiter in there was socializing and not doing much of anything else. Finally I went up to the manager letting her know I had ordered a MILKSHAKE over 15 minutes ago. She then told the waiter and he looked at the order screen and said \"oh yeah you're right\" then he went on to aruge with another employee about if I wanted it to go or not. Then a girl yelled to me across the restaurant asking if I wanted it to go. The shake wasn't that good and was about 12oz in a plastic cup! Very unprofessional and I am very disappointed and probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"Just OK in my book. Food did not taste fresh. It was $35.00 for 2 burgers and fries. Table were not clean. Portion was smaller than a fast food place so you pay dearly for this place being in the area it is in!"}
{"text":"If you're going for the FastFood type stuff this is a much better alternative, then Jack-in-the-Box, Carl's, Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, it's not really comparable. Great all beef Angus burgers, their wheat bun is the best, and I love any place that serves tater tots! Prices are very comparable with the other FastFood alternatives so why spend money elsewhere and they have a bar attached with $2.00 beers. :-)  I had a better Burger here than the Yard house next door, it came hot and juicy loved it! Will definitely be back when I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the manager that stopped by our table (Tim I think was his name) was very attentive and professional.   However, I'm only rating three stars because the food was just not good. The fries were greasy and undercooked and my chicken sandwich was dry and only lukewarm. The I Love Bacon burger that my boyfriend ordered ($17) was disappointing because it only had two tiny pieces of bacon. For that much money I would expect at least four pieces of bacon. And on top of all of that, it took 30+ minutes for our food to get to our table (although the server was very apologetic).  To make matters worse, while we were eating our sub-par meal, we had to listen to this loud, obnoxious, and completely foul-mouthed guy in the kitchen. He looked like he was the chef, at least I assume that's what he was because of how he was yelling at everyone. I wouldn't want to work there and probably won't go back to eat."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here for the first time tonight. I had the veggie burger and my friend had the inferno burger. Both were amazing! We also had an order of the non noms fried macaroni bites and loved them. They have super tasty sauces. The service was awesome too. Everyone was so polite and helpful. They were all working hard. The restaurant was super clean as well. Even the manager Ben made sure everything was to our satisfaction. He ran a great crew and was very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"The burgers are very good. I've had the BBQ before & just had the I Love Bacon burger (brisket & bacon yum!) tater tots are a must & love the beer specials. 32 oz. Sam Adams for $10 & you get to keep the cup :) all I have to say is I love I Love Burgers!"}
{"text":"We have always had really good experiences at I Love Burgers until today (Sunday 6/16) We arrived around 11:40 am to have some lunch. The first thing we notice is that the menu has changed. No more Tater Tots!!!!! Are you kidding me?? Serving tater tots made this place unique. Why would you take those away? Also onion rings are no long available along with a few other things. Very disappointing. The girl who took our order was pleasant but the rest of the crew, including a young lady in slacks, seemed to care more about laughing & joking in the kitchen than with anything else. I noticed that the ice tea was not available & so I asked the lady in slacks if they had any ice tea & she said no sorry. Ok I get that it was early in the day & maybe they hadn't made ice tea yet, which is weird, but it almost made it seem like they weren't going to offer it anymore. If that's the case #1 tell your customer when she asks & #2 remove the ice tea maker. It may be a small thing but it really irritated me. I should have received a better response from the person who looked like she might be the manager. Wen we received our burgers the patties looked way smaller than before. What has happened to this place? Really, really, really disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in the area and thought why not. First of all its pretty cheap, I think its because of how small the burgers are. The meat is natural grass fed which is a plus for me. They have a good size menu. We ordered a few burgers, grilled cheese, and a chicken sandwich. My husband enjoyed it for the price he said, my son loved the. grilled cheese. And I liked the chicken sandwich. Everything seems really fresh as far as ingredients go. If your not a very critical person that eats out a lot or hasn't had amazing burgers then you may love this place. Not really much else to say because it was just ok. Service was quick and staff was friendly. The design on the inside was cute."}
{"text":"Came here for their generous happy hour recently, and it's a good deal for what it is.  A bunch of finger foods for $2 and beers for $3?  That's a steal.  Our bartender was super cool and may have bent some rules for us as well, so that's an extra plus.  I wonder what their burgers taste like?"}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great! Mac n cheese and 2 I love bacon with egg and avocado."}
{"text":"I've often wondered what distinguishes a $7 burger from a $20 burger. This place makes me think there isn't much difference. In comparison to some build your own burger places like \"the Counter\", the menu here is pretty limited. Also for a place that proposes to \"I-heart-burgers\", the menu is surprisingly limited in burgers. Located in the Venitian shops, this place looks like a fancy Johnny Rockets. Burger, fries, and a Pepsi for $30!! Seriously?? Food was decent, but not particularly memorable. Beef was good quality and done as ordered. Bacon slightly undercooked and quite fatty. Asked for an egg over-easy, and it was pretty under done. Fries = decent, but nothing that sets then apart. Service = ok  Overall not worth the price. The food and cafeteria style setting do not justify the price.   Won't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Vegas for the New Year 2015 weekend. On our first day, we decided to walk the strip. My husband wanted to see inside Pallazzo since he's never been. While walking around we decided to stop in I Love Burgers for a quick bite. This would be our first meal of the day. The restaurant was clean and had a quirky style. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away. Our waitress was really nice and delightful. I ordered a medium (as opposed to medium rare) Dante Burger with additional avocados and water. My husband ordered a mushroom burger with onion rings and a Bloody Mary. It took about 10 minutes for the burgers to arrive. For the price of a $15 burger, I expected more. Although it was gourmet, I've had much better. My husband was almost done with his burger when I reminded him that his Bloody Mary hadn't arrived. He then reminded the waitress who had it brought over right away. So the burgers were okay, nothing to rave about. Our bill came out to $38 and I didn't even get a drink. But that's Vegas for ya! So here's the kicker, 3 hours later, I wasn't feeling well. My body started aching and I had a migraine. These symptoms I'm familiar with whenever I've had food poisoning. I knew it was because of the burger since I had nothing else to eat that day. I returned to my hotel room and vomited. I was then bed-ridden for the rest of the night but couldn't sleep due to muscle aches. The next day, I felt better but my neck muscles were still sore and it lasted for a week. My trip was ruined and I wasn't able to do any of the things I had planned to do that weekend."}
{"text":"Do not waste your money on this place. Price definetely did not match the food. We found this place by accident, the service was slow and you can get a better burger at carl's junior. Burger bar between the Mandalay Bay and the Luxor  is a better choice."}
{"text":"I used to love going here, would eat at least once a week. Today was horrible.  The food has gone down hill, the bathroom was filthy with paper all over the floor and dirty floors.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was a joke.  The special was Bloody Mary's and I had to keep correcting him, by the time he was done...they were a site and he said he'd been working there over a year.  One patron had to ask multiple times for their check.  Another patron asked for a beer with no fruit, the bartender was insistent on adding fruit and the patron stated that she did not want fruit in her beer. He commented, it's a citrus blend, there's already fruit in it.   The bartender was constantly touching his face, and didn't wash his hands before squeezing lime into the Bloody Mary's, when he couldn't get the garnish of lime on the rim he tossed it in and said \"oh well.\"  When were limes in Bloody Mary's?  The bartender then disappeared for a bit, took others orders, fiddle farted around...I finally piped up and said we were ready to order.  After our food was brought out, he never checked on us. The fries were over cooked, and our drink glasses were empty.  We had to ask for water and refills.  He tried to take away my friends food before she was done, but left 3 empty drink glasses in front of my other friend.   The picked up trash off the floor, then started cutting limes without washing his hands.  After he cleared our dishes, he disappeared again, and we sat there waiting to pay.  He came back and started working on another task and I had to ask for the check.  He bright the check, we paid by credit card, he brought the paperwork back for us to sign and just stood there.  After we filled it out and signed it, he still just stood there, then he said that he was supposed to get the signed copy and I said I know, we are not ready to give it to you yet.    In summary, food was not as good as it used to be, and the bartender who had been there for at least a year, needs to be trained in health and safety, customer service, and the items on the menu."}
{"text":"The appetizers were ok but too pricy than plates itself .. The drinks, merp .. The staff, friendly tho .."}
{"text":"I have been here thanks to Groupon and their $12 for $20 deal. I don't know if I would come without the Groupon, for 2 of us it would cost $30 for what we want. If you stick to the basic burger & no add one it's cheaper. The burgers are good & taste fresh. The truffle fries are AWESOME. I would avoid the Mac & cheese bites as the middle of them were still cold. They weren't anything special, rather bland. If you stick to the basic burger & even decide to go for truffle fries (again, I highly recommend) combo it's only $12. Again, the bigger burgers & add one add up fast. Overall it is not a bad place for a fresh better than fast food burger. Check Groupon before you go!!"}
{"text":"A fairly large burger and fries place right next to the the Wynn towers and at the entrance of the palazzo towers. We went in here for a quick bite for dinner and found a couple of veggie friendly items.  Waiter was friendly (must say service on the Vegas strip is usually very friendly) and suggested that black bean party can be subbed for the meat patty on any of the items on the  menu. Went for the spicy hot burger  (with hot green peppers) with beef subbed for the black bean patty. I believe the original veggie burger recipes is  better - so will not recommend the switch to others. Moreover, the kitchen got the order wrong initially and served the burgers with the beef patty (as per the menu). So be double careful if you do insist on subbing. Luckily, the friendly waiter caught it on time for me but was a fraction of a second late for my colleague. She had already taken the first bite but luckily did not swallow. Not a very pleasant experience after that. The place attempted to make amends and made our drinks on the house.  A+ for the waiter but an F for the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I Love Burgers isn't that great. I should have known better when I saw all of the signs in the mall that stated \"Tell them Dante sent you for 15% off your bill\" and the place was only 20% or so full, but I wanted to give them a try and was unfortunately unimpressed. While my wife liked her hot dog, my burger was devoid of any real flavor which was a real shame as the gorgonzola-topped burger should have been fantastic. The brioche bun was nice and soft but they really needed to season the burger and no amount of salt livened it up. The garlic parmesan fries were run of the mill thin frozen french fries and the garlic and parmesan came on the side in these little containers. Really? Why couldn't you have tossed the fries in it? I wouldn't be surprised if this place was closed the next time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I totally dug this place! There's been a big trend in Vegas for upscale burgers, and so many places who make amazing food forget the environment that's meant to go with a burger. I Love Burgers in Town Square has nailed it! Not only are they pumping out incredible burgers, fries and fried pickles (they're tasty, seriously), but they also have the atmosphere of a true burger restaurant! When I eat a burger I want to use both hands and require a million napkins by the end, and this place gets that. You don't have to worry about dressing nice or spending a small fortune.  If you're a bacon fan (and these days who isn't?) be sure to check out the I Love Bacon burger. There's bacon IN the burger, and in the sauce, and of course on top of the burger. And don't be afraid to create your own, or add a few things to one of their awesome burgers.  Friendly staff, excellent (burger) environment, and the perfect location to walk off your meal afterwards. Also be sure to check out the movie theater combo deal; $16 gets you a burger and a movie ticket. Considering movies already cost more than $12, this is a great deal. We didn't get it, but the manager mentioned it to us when he asked how our meal was going and we'll definitely try it out next time.  If you're in the mood for an upscale burger with a very casual feel I cannot recommend this place enough. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"It was good, I got a chicken burger but it was a little tough for me, not very tender. It still tasted good though. Sweet potato fries were great, and it looked like they could make you any drink you could imagine. Very good alcohol selection. Fun atmosphere and our sever was nice."}
{"text":"The Caprese burger was hands down the best hamburger I've ever had. The fried pickles were delicious."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. I had the bacon and egg sliders, my wife had the black bean burger; both were great. The service at the bar was outstanding."}
{"text":"Server forgot my side salad and the avocados on my burger that I asked for. Flavor is lacking. My two friends asked for medium cooked meat and one got medium rare and the other one got well done. Only leaving two stars because our server was nice and I feel like he tried his best.  Update: increased it to three stars because our server gave us a discount and he didn't need to do that but he did so great job on the customer service."}
{"text":"This place has the looks and the menu to satisfy, if only they could pull through on the service.   I attended I Love Burgers with a group of 6 people during a trade show at the Venetian. First, they told us the wait would be 20 minutes, we waited 45. Second- No one came over for our drink order or food order for 10 minutes. We had to grab a waiter to put our order in. Drink order was not right. We waited over 30 minutes for hamburgers!!! More than half of my team had to leave because the wait was too long.   Not only did we wait forever for our food....the food expediter was yelling at the cooks. I was appalled by the experience. If they knew they were short staffed, call more staff in, handle it in a better matter. I was really intrigued by the best fried pickles in the world, however i had to take mine to go and never got to eat them. If you are in the area and want to try, make sure its dead! Otherwise it wont be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Don't expect anything fast or served efficiently at this place! Still waiting at 50 minute mark for a burger while other customers walk out the door!  Save yourself from this experience!  Burgers finally arrived 75 minutes later after 11pm!  No plans on returning, in fact I will picket outside if given the opportunity.  Couldn't even get a glass of water for 20 minutes.  If I had a camera you would see everyone walking out!"}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets on the strip.  Good food, good service, good prices.  The manager , Mark, and all the wait staff are all very accommodating.  A must visit for anyone on this end of the strip."}
{"text":"Service and truffle fries were awesome! The BOGO mimosa/Bloody Mary deal on Sunday's was awesome and I paid only $8.00. BUT, what lacks is the flavor of my meal. And the price. I got the I love bacon burger. Almost no flavor to the meat at all. I enjoyed the fries so much more and had to add ranch and ketchup to my burger to add any taste. Also, I paid for two combos and paid over $30.. For burgers and fries, I would like something worth that money."}
{"text":"I got the double spiked The Buzz shake and it was so delicious.  It had some coffee flavored alcohol stuff in it.  The burgers were definately overpriced and I can't say it got my mouth watering.  It was good, but not my flavor."}
{"text":"Good location in the Palazzo.  We visited here because the 10best ranked this place as the #2 burger in Vegas.  What was great was the big milkshakes (plenty to share) and mac and cheese nom noms (fried mac squares).  The fried pickles were bland and what we came for, the burgers, were not that fantastic.  The patty was in need of some more seasoning as it was bland also."}
{"text":"It's a high-priced burger, which is ok, since they have some interesting options for topping (I got the caprese - with mozzarella and balsamic, although...no tomatoes???). However, I do not wish to pay $10 for a burger at a fast-food joint. Your food is served with plasticware (this is my pet peeve!), typical fast-food napkins and packets of mustard/mayo/ketchup. I mean, seriously, couldn't they spring for the squeeze bottles on the table??? The fries and sweet potato fries were both good and my husband and I both liked our burgers.  There is a bar on one side and it looks like they have some decent specials on weekdays ($2.50 beers). Also, the 2 locations (about to be 3 - they're opening one on Fremont) are locally-owned, so I'm boosting them to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Not a great value for the price you have to pay for these little burgers. They say they are \"1/3\" pound patties but it's more like paying $10 for a slider. I could easily eat about 3 of these sliders and still hit McDonald's on my way home.  The fries don't come with your burger. Instead you can pay $4 for a combo or $4 or a side of fries. What's the difference?  Online it says happy hour is around the usual happy hour time, 5pm, however they actually do their \"happy hour\" from 2-4pm. Sounds more like a kiddie hour to me.  The $2 cheap beer is the only decent thing here.  Everything else is over priced and not filling.  I could go on about the lack of service and great deal of confusion we faced when coming here but I'll spare you that part of this review.   One star is my gut review but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and submit a 2  You're welcome I love burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers, casual atmosphere, and an extremely service-oriented staff. Sean was great and a super waiter! The casual yet higher-end atmosphere was just what we were looking for after a day in the Sands/Venetian poker room. Both of our burgers were delicious and high quality. Cooked perfectly too.  Our demogs: late 40's, professionally employed, live in Colorado."}
{"text":"Started off with fried pickles and they were the best I've ever had, the batter Was on point.. Had a burger with bacon, cheese and Cole slaw was so delicious, it was named after our server the Kenny special..  Garlic fries so good! The service was great, Kenny was great!!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You will get food poisoning here! Don't risk your vacation. Stay especially away from the Ahi burger! Disgusting food, soggy ass fries. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a yummy juicy burger , soooo I begged my boyfriend if we could come here , 30 dollars for 2 burgers & a side of fries. I gave this 2 stars only because the girl who took my order (cashier) was super nice being that my boyfriend is always indecisive she didn't get upset that we were taking long ... As we waited for our food we walked around & there was cool giant chalk boards you can draw on.   Fries were good  Cheese sauce was decent.  My burger wasn't nasty but it wasn't the juicy burger I had hoped for , I'll stick to Johnny Rockets. , I asked for a hard fried egg but I got a runny egg. My boyfriend asked for a well done burger his was pink in the middle & he had a runny egg as well .... His was BAD , so ..... He complains & they tell him they'll make him a new one ... How ever they told us his couldn't be well done because he got the I love bacon burger , meanwhile there was no pink to be found in my burger & I got the same exact one ! Lol. Such a joke .... So we got the burger back after 30 mins , it was the same burger he had before because the same exact piece he broke off was broken off , the burger was just dried & pink now ... We were running late for a movie so he still ate it. I felt bad but we won't be going back , seems like teenagers run that place anyways. Me being a manager , the place is not ran correctly & the only thing that stood out to me was our cashiers great personality to provide us with exceptional customer service. Save your money ... Go to in n out or Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"I saw that they had sweet potato fries and it was a done deal for me.   My friends also ordered the fried dill pickles - super yum - they reminded me to fish and chips for some reason or maybe I'm just thinking about the tartar sauce and my cousin ordered the mac and cheese cubes. They were coozies, but def could've done without those 5 little dumplings sized thangs.  (All around $4-5)   My cousin and I shared the Caprese burger, meat was on point and super moist with all the essential toppings. Someone else had the Ahi burger but it just seemed alright.  (Burgers around $11-15)   Decor was cute, felt like I was eating under some giant mushrooms and they had TVs along the side so that you can enjoy the game while downing the goods.   They also had cute \"I heart Burgers\" tees which I was tempted to get ... but realized it'd probably give off the \"I'm a hella fatty\" vibe so had to pass.  Maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"Food is okay. We ordered nom noms, tater tots, and seoul with truffle fries. Their lemonade sucks and worst of all they dont allow pets in :(   We were pretty much kicked outside in the heat n were told we can only eat out on the patio. Boo :( Nbd though."}
{"text":"Ordered the I heart bacon burger which was blend of brisket and bacon..and have to say couldn't really tell the difference.  Also ordered the garbage fries which sounded good on the menu but was not executed very well.  I would think it would be hard to mess up something called \"garbage fries\" but the portion was small and it was pretty much a greasy cheesy ehhh...I figure if I'm going to eat junk it better be worth it..and this definitely was not.  I'd rather go to steak n shake or 5 guys."}
{"text":"Wanted a small portion to go .... ordered a kids meal and they wanted to charge me extra bc no kid under 12 was with me. They asked if the extra charge was  ok and I said No. I said I will take my business elsewhere. I understand if I am eating in then charging me extra since they have to pay rent. I was getting the item to go and instead they lost all my business now.   As I walked past other restaurants they did not have extra fees for kids meals. Was a very disappointing customer service experience. Had eaten here several time before with large groups and ordered full menu items. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing burger! We did a groupon for nom noms and 2 daiquiris. The burger (the standard) was delicious. Best tasting grease in town, though not super greasy!  And the staff was wonderful and it was a fun atmosphere too. Ill be back!!"}
{"text":"I work valet in the casino and I have to say that this is my favorite burger place on the strip. I eat there for lunch all the time and I have not had anything I didn't like.  From the burgers/fries/shakes, you won't find anything better.  The service is great and the employees are always so nice as well. My wife and I even come down to the strip to eat here on my days off its so good. Definitely worth a trip here if your looking for a great lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Ate here early on a Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I sat in the bar. The bartender was extremely rude right off the bat. Service was horrible. I had to wait a long time for my bottomless mimosas every time I wanted a refill. I also ordered a burger and not only was it really small but it tasted pretty average. Nothing special about this place. Overpriced and not worth the time."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the loco moco, which they only serve during  breakfast hours (8-11:30 AM).  PRESENTATION: 4/5 Food was well presented, nicely garnished and looked visually appetizing   PRICE: 2.5/5 Loco moco cost $14 for not a lot of food and the taste wasn't really worth the price tag either. In the photo they use for advertising their loco moco it shows a GIANT rounded mountain of rice but on the actual plate I got there is a very thin layer of rice under the patty, so score was further reduced for misleading advertising.  TASTE: 3/5 Everything on the loco moco tasted good EXCEPT for the burger patty; Considering this is a burger place, that was pretty disappointing. Kimchi was surprisingly good, eggs were perfectly cooked, and the gravy was delicious. However the burger patty, despite being cooked to medium,  tasted very dry with no flavor.   Probably would not come back unless everywhere else had a long wait."}
{"text":"A little pricey for a small (but tasty) burger. That alone makes me hesitant to come back; I don't feel as if I got my money's worth. Of more concern was the cleanliness. Tables, floors, and bathrooms were all dirty (especially the bathroom). Probably won't be coming back. And, for the record, I'm still in the restaurant, surveying the waste of potential this place is."}
{"text":"I do love burgers.  What I don't love is astoundingly bad service and a thirty dollar burger that tastes like five.  I'll spare you the gory details, but the service at the bar was so bad that almost every diner around me was slinging insults at the one bartender who was (sort of) trying to take care of thirty people at lunchtime.  She seemed to have given up on the job without actually quitting.  I couldn't believe the horde of poor bastards who were waiting in line outside of this abomination as I left.  I felt like shouting at all of them to STAY THE HELL AWAY!!! RUN!!!  And then I remembered I use Yelp.  Take that, you sorry asshats.  Your restaurant sucks."}
{"text":"I do not eat a ton of burgers but after 2 days in Vegas my body needed the mystical healing properties only burgers possess.  As we stumbled by this place we saw a picture of their burger on the wall and it looked pretty amazing.  The menu was very unique with options I've never seen before.   Since I barely had the energy to order I just pointed to the picture on the wall and said bring me that.  Surprisingly what they brought looked exactly like the picture and that never happens!  It was their BBQ burger and it was really good, especially since it was served on a brioche bun.  The meat was cooked a little more than I would've liked but the sweet BBQ sauce fixed everything.  We didn't have fries but my friend ordered fried pickles with ranch and I was surprised at how good they were.  I guess it was a little pricey for what it was but still very good and worth a try."}
{"text":"Not a \"bad\" experience at all. The Kobe/Wagyu beef burger is \"ok\". The truffle cheese had little or no taste of truffle. The beef was not seasoned at all. It was a tender burger, but no taste.  Not worth $25. Very bland. The garlic Parmesan fries were good. Service was great,"}
{"text":"These are good burgers!  I love the Caprise burger.  Very juicy and cooked just right. They look a little small at first, but I'm always stuffed when I leave.  These burgers are made of a good quality grass fed beef.  Good hamburgers at a decent price.  More expensive than a fast food place and much better, but less than Bachi Burger (which I also love, and which is one of the few other places you can get the grass fed beef."}
{"text":"I had the I (heart) bacon burger. I ordered it medium and it came well done. It was just OK quality. Also overpriced. You would get a better burger for less at a diner."}
{"text":"BURGERLICIOUS!  Great stop for some decent priced hamburgers in VEGAS!  I ordered the Seoul Burger Medium cooked and it was amazing! The hamburger comes with poached egg, avocado, kimchi for the right combination.   First bite the hamburger literally oozed out with flavor from the meat and the egg from the yolk. It was even better when it was then mixed with kimchi and avocado.   The garbage fries is also fantastic. Great mix of everything you can imagine. Please eat with a fork.   TOP it off, the place has alcoholic slushes and alcoholic smoothies! I ordered the lemonade with orange flavored liqueur. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna burger, a very good draft beer selection, and sweet potato fries. In Vegas? Yes, located on the second floor of a glittery casino, I *Heart* Burgers has it all.  If you don't get the cubed and seared ahi tuna burger, you're a damn food fool, unless of course you get the beef caprese burger with tomato, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar. Or any of their other awesome burgers.  And did I mention the draft beers? Las Vegas, for all of its alcohol, is generally a dry, sad little town when it comes good beer. It's harder to find a draft IPA here than a hotel without slot machines, but alas, I Love Burgers has over a dozen craft beers on tap, including some local ones I hadn't tried before.  All for a pretty modest price. I Love \"I Love Burgers.\""}
{"text":"Various types of burgers and fries to try but not to worry they have your standard hamburger or cheese burger if you're not feeling adventitious! Feeling like taking a spin? Try one of their milkshakes they're cool you off in the summer Vegas heat!"}
{"text":"Went during 2015 Town Scary. The staff was amazing! Hundred's of people and they just smiled and provided excellent service. The fried pickles are some of the best this southern girl has had. The shakes were creamy. The burgers! OMG the burgers!! Tender fresh ingredients. We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast at I Love Burgers at the Shoppes at the Palazzo.  This place is open at 8 a.m. for breakfast. I Love Burgers uses the American burger in so many ways!  For Breakfast, we ordered I Love Loco Moco - a Hawaiian breakfast of steam rice with a juicy Angus Burger, a sunny side egg on top of the burger, side of kimchi and brown gravy.  Yup!  I kid you not!  Rice for brekkie - why not?!?  It was quite good, according to my mum.  We also ordered the On The Border - which is a Mexican skillet dish served with chunky potaotes, jalapeno peppers,  Angus Burger, 2 sunny-side eggs, a warm tortillia with sour cream and salsa.  Very tasty and very filling!  The other really good item we ordered is the Heart and Seoul - Korean take on brekkie - fried rice, Angus burger, 3 sunny-side eggs, side of kimchi and fried onion strings.  Really, really god and also, very filling!    Next time, we will try their burgers at lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Went here as part of a package that came with Rock of Ages tickets. Hard to find, far away from the Rock of Ages theatre.  VERY LOUD with suboptimal service and uncomfortable seating.  Huge ok-flavored burgers with giant piles of tasty fries, so if you are the size of a lumberjack you will be happy. The \"cost\" for four people with sodas was marked as $85.00.  With so many other dining choices around in the Palazzo, would skip this."}
{"text":"Stopped to have burgers with family.  Burger is pretty good.  Pricey for a burger, wasn't worth the $$, especially to not have fries.  Service was average.  Not very attentive.   Too many tables for the waitress.  Food came out quick and was hot.  Probably would eat again with a coupon. With great service and better value, would be 4 stars."}
{"text":"Didn't have the appetite to try different things, but the inferno burger I had was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how small the menu was and without many choices I ordered the BBQ burger, my girlfriend didn't order anything because the limited choices weren't appealing to her, and her son got the kids hot dog. My burger came out pretty quick but just the burger no hot dog. I thought it was probably on the way but after quite some time we realized they forgot it. The bartender noticed there was no other food on the table and asked if we were ok. We told him no and he told a lady that we never got the hotdog and not believing us even though the table only had one plate on it she asked to see our receipt kind of rudely like we were lying. Shortly after the hot dog came out and she said sorry but didn't seem sincere or like she wanted to help make up for the problem. Then I felt that the small burger that doesn't come with fries wasn't going to be enough so I went to order fries and then get 2 drinks at the bar. When I got back to the table the fries were there but the girl who asked to see the receipt tried to make it seem like they were giving us an order of fries to make up for the situation to my girlfriend when the reality is I paid for them.  This was my first and only time going here. The customer service was terrible and the burger was mediocre and small. I was expecting more flavor. The only positive was the bartender as he was the only one that tried to help when he noticed that my girl's son didn't have food in front of him and was helpful on suggesting a white IPA beer to me that was delicious."}
{"text":"I really thought this place was just OK and didn't really knock my socks off. I ordered the I love bacon burger and my bf ordered the Seoul burger The burger patties were weirdly shaped and kind of small but at least that means they are maybe hand-made because of the irregular shape. But honestly, if I am paying $10 for a burger without a side, I expect the wow factor. The Bacon burger was standard but the Seoul burger had too much going on. It was drowning in their mayo and I could not pick out anything distinct in the flavor profile and it just did not seem to work for me. We shared some truffle fries and they also disappointed me but it may be because I prefer truffle fries to be thin/shoe-string and these were thicker so it just absorbed the oil.   I will say that I liked the decor of the establishment of the chalkboards. It was fun to look around and see what people have written and add my own art. The only downside to that is our table was covered in chalk dust when we sat down. The open kitchen area to watch your food being made was also nice and the staff was having a good time and laughing. I like it when a place seems like a great place to work."}
{"text":"The food is super good but could you put your employees in check? I was eating there and one of your off the clock employees was there picking up her check or whatever, and she was hanging around for almost an hour which i wouldn't have cared or noticed had she not been dressed like a disgusting cheap hooker. Get some class people.  Not looking for a side of ugly whore with my burger."}
{"text":"Nothing starts off a weekend of bachelorette awesomeness like a tasty burger.  A friend & I split a Caprese burger which I thought was a nice flavor combination; & I liked how the restaurant's name is branded into the top of the bun. Our group also shared some Garbage fries & some Fried mac 'n cheese nom noms. My best description for the fries is that they are like chili cheese fries on crack. To be honest, they weren't all that special, but the jalapeño somehow kept me going back for more. The nom noms (yes, that's really the name) were nice & crispy on the outside but the actual mac 'n cheese was bland & had a weird grittiness.  The service was great as I think the waiters/waitresses have plenty of experience handling large groups of guys/gals. This is a good place to check out if you're in the mood for something quick, casual, but still good on the Strip."}
{"text":"Burgers were a bit on the pricey side, however, they were decent portions.   Service was lacking on a slow day: 1) Burgers took about 20 -25 minutes to come out, 2) water/beverage came out after food was brought to the table, 3) Server was very inattentive."}
{"text":"Housed in the perennially empty The Palazzo shopping arcade, I Love Burgers only fit in this shopping center is on price  - costly, it would be better suited in the Miracle Mile mall up the road, but it would need to drop its prices a considerable sum in order to not scare off its middle America patrons.  Now we all know that Las Vegas is not the value destination it was once decades ago, but $7.00 for a shake?  The price cannot easily be justified, unless the milk was made with organic or raw milk and even then, that would be a stretch.  Appetizers of cheese sticks would have probably been better still frozen as a cheese pop, rather than the fried bland rectangles that they were.  One kitchen staff member easily observed from the counter when I was seated was busy wiping his runny nose with his hand which promptly went into a bin of cooked french fries, talk about salty, glad I didn't order the fries.  The enormous space, which used to house a Asian restaurant in a different lifetime will probably meet the same fate, unless they place more effort in preparing better tasting foods and renegotiating the lease on the space to reduce costs."}
{"text":"We were at Palazzo and came by to watch the Clippers game over food and drinks. Our server was nice, but another waiter was being rude to my friend. Anyways, I ordered the onion rings ($8) because I wasn't feeling a burger. It's kind of cool that they stamped their logo on the bun. I think I would try the hot dogs next time if there is one though. Our table also ordered the garbage fries ($8) to share. I was pretty disappointed with this one. I'm a huge lover of fries but it felt so \"healthy\" covered in olives, cilantro and jalapeños. My friends said the poutine fries went too great either. And to add, everything is a bit overpriced. I'd rather go to Burgr by Gordon Ramsey for a gourmet burger."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because it's a bit pricey for burgers. However, my husband and I agreed our burgers were some of the best we've ever had.  Everything is clearly fresh and super delic! They were packed as there was a huge conference in town at the time, and even with that the staff was amazing! They were friendly, fast, and communicated expectations (wait times, etc) very truthfully and clearly. Great burgers, good fries, and service with a smile. I'd def recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of the best places we ate at on our trip. We had great service the garbage fries were awesome and my husband and I both loved our steak burgers. We almost went back again had we not already had other plans... Give this place a shot you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"I spent way too much time at the bar chatting with Izzy while in town for the weekend with friends. Drinks here are great-try a spiked shake! Do yourself a favor and ask for a toe shot!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. I'm so disappointed  I wasted a meal eating here.  A salad, shake, soda and burger with a side of onion rings for $50???? The salad was over dressed and extremely salty. The burger tasted like it was a frozen grocery store patty.  Not worth the trip at all."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a big juicy burger and this place did not let me down.  I had the I Love Bacon burger and enjoyed every bite I was able to finish.  The flavor was excellent!  My roommate loved her burger as well.    The service was great from the host down to the guy who delivered the food.  In addition we received our food quickly.  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting good service and good food.  Ask for Ben when you go!"}
{"text":"I thought in & out burgers was good! The burgers was outstanding. This place is kind of on the high side be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you bring the family. overall very clean place even bathrooms. Did not have a military discount."}
{"text":"My chicken burger was very dry. My partner's BBQ burger was mediocre at best. We complained, but all they said was they are sorry. Not worth the $9.00 a burger."}
{"text":"Burgers n Beer :-)"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend after wandering around the venetian and palazzo and not really knowing where to go that would be both delicious and somewhat affordable.   i love burgers was still a little expensive for my tastes, but much more reasonable compared to everything else in the vicinity, and probably ultimately just a few more bucks than the food court, which offered nathan's hot dogs as a best option.   we ordered the sweet potato fries to share. my friend got a shake which i believe she enjoyed. we were a little grossed out by the idea of the blueberry panshake and caramel corn shake (with real corn?) but didn't try either so i guess i can't be the judge of that.   the fries themselves were good. we got the garlic sauce which i have to say was a little disappointing for me. i ended up using ketchup.   i didn't get a burger at i love burgers. i got the warm spinach salad which came with an egg in the shape of a heart. how do you get an egg to be heart shaped? it was hard boiled but the center was a little soft. edible though. overall i guess i found the salad decent. i think it was supposed to come with cheese but i'm pretty sure mine had no cheese.   i think i wish i had just gotten a burger. i don't know if i really saved that many calories and perhaps one of their other options might have been more delicious. the salad was fine. overall the restaurant seems to have decent food (nothing to write home about, in my opinion...) and prices that are on the pricey side, but still reasonable for this part of vegas.   i think basically the lesson i learned is that if you're going to go to vegas -- either be rich or win big and then go the extra mile and spend a few more dollars on your dinner at one of the celeb chef restaurants.   otherwise go to i love burgers and perhaps try a burger instead of the salad and see if you have better luck."}
{"text":"Wow! I cannot believe this place can charge this much for a so-so burger. It was small, flavorless, and I swear I tasted freezer burn. I laugh at the fact that I spent so much and received so little in return. Oh, did I fail to mention that it also cost me $1 per topping?! I do not understand the rave about these burgers.  I also ordered a half-shake, at least that is what I call it. A $6 mini-shake. I can understand if the quality is great, but come on. The shakes at McDonald's are just as good.  This place is not a fine dining establishment, so why must I wait 22 minutes for a so-so burger, fries, and a mini-shake? Oh right, there were two of us.  Sorry, but I was really let down. I just wanted a decent burger and to enjoy this place. I will not return. It is a shame with all the clientele running through Town Square, you would think they would step-up their game."}
{"text":"What a joke.  If you're a burger person, this place will disappoint.  The buns they use tastes like wonder bread. The actual burger was tasteless. Nothing like Umami, even Fat Burger is tastier..."}
{"text":"This is a good burger option if you are in the area. I work in the area around Town Square so it has been a convenient lunch option on several occasions. I also like that the restaurant is a quick walk from nearby parking.   I like that they have many different burger options and specials. There should be something for everyone here. The Thanksgiving Burger (made with a turkey burger, cranberry, and stuffing) is a little different and tasty. On my last visit I ordered the Patty Melt special and thought it was good. It was grilled cheese toasted bread and melty cheese meets burger. That is an enjoyable combination in my opinion. I enjoyed this with tater tots. It's always a win when tater tots are an option.   I've always had friendly service and the food comes out quick enough for this to be a good lunch hour option. The burgers aren't cheap, but I wouldn't say they are overpriced for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Stopped in real quick at the bar and ordered food to go.    Mac n cheese noms: basically deep fried mac n cheese cubs/tots.  Comes with a cheese sauce.  A little too creamy/saucy with the cheese in the noms plus the cheese sauce was overkill.  Cheese wasn't sharp enough for my liking.    Parm burger: it's a burger for the vegetarians.  2 slabs of eggplant parm with cheese and marinara sauce between 2 buns.  it was okay on flavor since it's missing all the veggies that a burger would normally have.  they decided to just replicate the italian dish and put it between 2 buns and call it a burger.  for me, i would've preferred a more burger-like experience with all the veggies.  Standard burger: what my fiance got.  I don't think he had anything remarkable to say about it.  Garlic parmesan fries: decent fries, not amazing, but not bad.  Prices were decent for a Las Vegas restaurant.  Burgers range $10-15ish, sides are around $5-7.  Nice that they got a few tv's around for you to watch any sports games going on."}
{"text":"Oh, I do not love \"I Love Burger\".  Sitting in the middle of the Palazzo in Vegas, you have high expectations for a place called I Love Burger.  The build out was really cool with a twist of futuristic and retro.  Our party of 12 sat on some down expecting that best burger in town.  We excitedly split several different burgers because they all sounded good.  All of the burgers were tiny portions for its price tag.  On top of it, it wasn't even cooked properly making the beef too dry.  The bun was cold and dry.  The toppings were just greasy.  I was so disappointed in it.  After lunch, I went else where looking for something better to satiate my appetite.  That's pretty bad!  I'll probably order room service next time."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger for me and my boss. Ordered it medium and clearly was medium rare on both! Extra charge for fries. Y'all ain't that great."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible! The food is good, but doesn't make up for the terrible service, long waits, and sterile atmosphere. I went with a friend on a Sunday afternoon, before the lunch crowd. Even though the restaurant was half empty, we had to wait for a table and once we were seated, it took a while for someone to come greet us.   A few of their menu items weren't available. After ordering, it took over forty minutes for our food to come... yes, over 40 minutes for 2 burgers and 2 orders of fries. When I asked the waitress, she responded that all orders take over 30 minutes and that she forgot to mention this to us when we were seated. An hour and $50 later, it was clear that In & Out Burger would have been the way to go."}
{"text":"Checking this place for the first time and I must say it was pretty good. I ordered the inferno burger but was a little disappointed that it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. The flavor of the meat was good, but but not $17 good for a burger. Fuddruckers' Inferno Burger is much better tasting and it's half the price. $4 Ice Tea is a bit pricey as well. I don't think I'll come back again for a burger here."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon and glad I did. I get it, there in the Palazzo but $50 bucks for 2 burgers, 1 fry, and 1 drink? The burgers were good as well as filling, but not the best I have had. The fries, well, they have to do something about those. Come up with a different variety or something. Lame and wimpy about half way into dinner.  It's an okay place, but would I do it twice? Nope..."}
{"text":"This place should be called I Hate Burgers. Our party ordered a total of 6 different burgers. Every single person complained about how dry and terrible the burger was. I had the salmon burger. It was terrible. The patty tasted like a frozen fishy mushy mess. All of our buns were dry and crumbly. Even the french fries were terrible. I would never return."}
{"text":"Better than expected, we had a great group meal there one night during CES with a few tough critics in attendance, and we all were pretty happy with what we got.  Definitely a bit on the expensive side, but no wait and we're in Vegas...  The wait staff there was really very good."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Palazzo and were looking for a quick meal.  I Love Burgers was inside our hotel so it fit the bill.  I was a bit wary about trying this place because of the reviews here.  But after actually having a meal here I can honestly say I don't know why this place doesn't have more stars.  I had a standard cheeseburger and it was yummy.  It was cooked well done the way I like it without being dry or charred.  The toppings were fresh and I LOVED the tater tots.    Service was excellent.  I believe our servers names was Leon but it's been a few days so I'm not sure.  He kept our drinks filled and was on top of all of our needs.  The food runner (a young woman with blonde hair) was also great and helped with any extra items we might need.    I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a good burger and fries meal."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian bean burger and fries. Giving one point for the fries and friendly service. Burger was a burnt veggie patty on a cold bun. No taste other than charcoal :/"}
{"text":"If there were an option for zero stars - that is what this place would get. I RARELY write reviews but this place was AWFUL! Worst burger I think I've ever had...reminded me of high school cafeteria meat. I paid for extra toppings that were not received and the french fries were so soggy and undercooked I thought I was going to get sick from the first bite. Please do not even consider ordering from this place!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Was immediately greeted enthusiastically and had no trouble ordering. Place was busy but not packed.   We had a BBQ burger w/ sweet potato fries and a I love bacon burger with regular fries. Came out pretty quickly and was suitably hot. Thumbs up on both burgers. Cooked nicely and were quite tasty, however the meat could have been a little juicier. Fries were crispy and well seasoned.   I do think it's pricey for the product; hence only three stars (average). Not great value. Chalk it up to high rent at Town Square.  I think they'd better up the quality if they want to make it there.   I personally think one can get an equal or better burger at just about any tavern in town, not to mention In'nOut, Smashburger, and Five Guys. Not sure if we'll go back, since there are many other options for food there."}
{"text":"I am in \"LOVE\" with I love burgers. Honestly it is so so so yummy... My hubby and I have been there been numerous times.. We absolutely adore Town Square.. So finding this place is a plus! I strongly recommend the I love bacon burger and the pickles fries! Check them out!"}
{"text":"While walking through the Palazzo last weekend and starving, my girlfriends and I decided to hit up I Love Burgers. Honestly, we thought the menu was cute so we went in. It didnt have the upscale feel that I like, but I noticed the cocktails on the menu and I was sold. I had the fried pickles, parm fries, and the Upstream (salmon) burger. The pickles were good, the fries were so-so (just powdery and not parmasean-garlicky) but HUGE portion, and my burger was DELICIOUS. I absolutely love salmon burgers so whenever I see one on a menu I have to try it. It doesnt compare to the one I had in Vancouver but it was very good. I couldnt even finish because it was filling. I also had a Peach Fizz cocktail which was very good, although not blended enough to my liking. Service was fine, nothing to complain about there. It was a bit on the pricey side, but that's Vegas!"}
{"text":"(I initially posted this on the wrong location.)  I don't love these burgers. The staff was friendly enough. That's the one star.  We got here around 8pm on a Thursday. It was positively deserted, save the wax figure of The Rock accosting you upon entry. (I have no idea what that's about.)  The burgers, for the smallest one, is $5.99.  And if you want anything on it, it's a $1 per item. And if you want fries and a drink? ANOTHER $4.99!  So basically, you're paying like $12-$15 for a burger n' fries. If I'm going to spend that much, I'll blow the extra $5 and go to Holstein's. If I'm eating food out of a basket, I expect to pay under $10 for it.  The atmosphere is very \"off campus burger joint\", not something you'd find in Town Square. But a college student couldn't afford to eat here.  It was all tables and chairs, so it didn't really seem like the kind of place you'd hang out in and drink beers at happy hour, which is something they push heavily. There's lots of ads and chalkboards for happy hour cocktails and beer bucket specials.    Their burger options were kind of minimal, too. The turkey burger seemed to only be available if you got it with cranberries and stuffing, which defeats the purpose of a healthy turkey burger. No bun options, either, so no wheat for me.  So I got the smallest burger they offered (5 oz).  When it finally arrived (we waited quite a while), it seemed like far more than 5oz.  And it was DENSE, like a hockey puck kinda. It didn't taste bad, per se, just a bit dry and like I said, dense. It was a bit bland, as well.   I asked the hostess what kind of beef they served and she proudly declared, \"100% angus beef!\" and I said, \"can you tell me how much fat? Like is it 80/20 or 85/15?\"  I asked because usually a burger that dense and dry is rocking a 7% fat content.  After, I swear to god, 15 minutes and lots of confusion and chicken without a head-type running around, the cook came out and told me -- get this -- \"It's 80/20, but when we're done cooking it, it's 85/15.\"  That's not quite how that works, sport, but ok.  It's one or the other, you don't have the authority to determine how much fat is in it after you've cooked it. You have to go by what's in it before.  But after all that running around and looking in the freezer, clearly, no one has any idea what they're cooking.  I shan't be going back here, unfortunately.  Like I said, the staff was nice enough, but other than that, it's not my bag."}
{"text":"STOP don't go in! 4 burgers 3 fries $100!!!!! I think salt was extra because the all the burgers were so bland. They even got two orders wrong, just  bad all around. What's next Hep-A? Thanks to my buddy's for introducing me to \"In and Out burger\" now that's the place to go!"}
{"text":"After one big night of drinking, burgers sounded kinda good. So I when grind at \"I Love Burgers.\" Brah, the burgers broke the mouth. Kinda pricey but not bad. I woulda rated this place a 4 or maybe 3.5 on the burgers alone. Faka was mean! But extra points was cuz, my server Jenny was on point. She can tell we were hungry already and was right there when we was ready to order. Plus, kinda nice to be greeted with a friendly smile once you stay in your seats. So... To make a long story short, I went for burgers, would go back for service by Jenny. And, once again, FAKA MEAN!"}
{"text":"First off Mark the manager is awesome,  very helpful  and knows the food. All the staff is great. The fried pickles are amazing,  the best out there.  The burgers  are really good  an all around great  menu and choices."}
{"text":"Celebrating our bachelorette in Vegas and stopped here for lunch. The service was top notch!  The host sat us immediately and introduced our server Leon.  Who was so friendly and kind. He got us waters right away and took care of each and everyone in our party. Food was tasty! After eating our sever got our bachelorette a free shot to celebrate!  Totally recommend this place!!! The only downside was price....$25 for a turkey burger. What?"}
{"text":"We frequent town square often and we also have two young boys under the age of 3....having said that, that automatically cancels out like 5 of the restaurants in this mall for us. (Uh - fine dining cheerio disaster party of 4anyone?)   We went shopping last night and then of course all got hungry all at once, having passed this place a million times but hesitant from reviews we finally came in for a visit.  From the minute we walked in we were impressed and no that doesn't mean this is some sort of Chuck-E-Cheese prototype. For us, it was more of an open dining plan, kid friendly but still adult friendly atmosphere (if that makes sense). Pricing is average, $9-$10 average for a burger - fries or a \"combo\" is additional. I had the \"I love Bacon\" and my husband had the \"Inferno\"..not bad at all.  What really got us while sitting down was their advertisement for their happy hour - $2 beer from 4pm-6pm and then again after 8pm. One of the waitresses (maybe the manager?) stopped by and was super friendly to our babies.  My husband is extremely picky. I always joke and tell him he should have been a professional critic for a living. And he LOVED this place. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It use to be good. I don't eat red meat. I loved the turkey Burger with cranberry sauce. Now my only option besides the veggie Burger is a bland chicken Burger. So disappointed."}
{"text":"4 of us came here for happy hour. Had burger sliders, pouline fries and chic finger with our daiquiries and beer. The service was excellent, bartenders kept our drinks coming and always checking on us. Great burger when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Was quite impressed with the selection. The I love bacon burger is fantastic. The flavor of the bacon and brisket was a few notches above a beef patty. Surprisingly juicy burger with a bacon mayo that was heavenly. The brioche bun and Gouda cheese was A+ The vanilla shake and onion rings were worth the price ."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and it was nothing less then AWESOME....Grass Fed burgers, you cannot beat that.  This is fast casual dining bit AMAZING.  Now the best part, they have a great bar here and Laura the Bartendar is one of the best I've come across.  Her knowledge of drinks is so far advanced from most bartenders who've been around for a long time.  You NEED to come visit Laura and enjoy some great happy hour drinks.  If you look at the picture, this burger was really juicy, was very tasty and the amount of fries they give you is a huge amount and combined with the burger, you can roll out the door.  Oh wait that's when you leave the bar.  I highly recommend this place and only hope they continue to serve grass fed because this place is one of the best for a fast casual dining place.  If you get the chance to come when Laura is in the bar, you will leave here happy."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend having the sweet potato fries as a sider!! The tarter tats are awesome as well If you are staying at the pallazzo and feel like having a burger or any american style food and you are tired of walking thats the place to go! Me and my brother had a great meal. The only thing is a little pricey"}
{"text":"The website and the sign out front say Grass-Fed.  I went to this location and the menu doesn't say anything about grass fed.  Once I inquired the server says... oh, we no longer serve Grass-Fed.  The portions are small for the price.  I won't go here again."}
{"text":"Ordered medium well burgers got medium rare. The food wasn't that great either! Services was horrible! BEWARE since they're so slow they will take your food away even when your not done eating! Told the manager about it and she didn't do anything. The sad part was she say she knew about it but I guess she was waiting for the customer to complained first. Wow never ever going back to this placed again. I would give it a 0 for the rating"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey and not really worth it. I would definitely go back to Stripburger instead.  We started with the cheese sticks and mac and cheese nom noms (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA?select=_U-515IIuae5qvD7sYFc7A#xQXBjTZ0XICzhGSTDkioMg) I felt like they were both a bit dry and could be more gooey, I mean c'mon isn't that why we eat cheese because of the gooey goodness?  We split a IHEARTBacon Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/R6jpwPBe9edy0P64uyaLKA?select=_U-515IIuae5qvD7sYFc7A#7-sF-QbQc2CpIUWAST3wHA) which definitely sounded a lot better then it tasted. Dry and not as flavorful as you would expect for having 3 different types of bacon in it.   Pricey and left unsatisfied. I want to \"I Love Burgers\" but it's more like \"I've Had Better Burgers.\"  Also our service was slow for a not so busy place.  Meh. I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Hamburgers....what's the big deal?? With so many burger joints in town offering \"the greatest burger you've ever had\", why should I Love Burgers be any different??? Well guess what? Not only are they different, but they're THE BOMB!!!  Now granted, the burger prices are a lil on the heavy side...but hey...you get what you pay for....and the burgers here are definitely worth it!!!!  Next time you're at I Love Burgers at the Palazzo, ask for JENNY as your server....she was THE BEST!!!! With such 5 star service from Jenny and delicious burgers to top it off I will definitely be coming back for seconds and thirds and so on!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were starving, we needed a quick bite.  I enjoyed my 7 oz. BBQ burger, I added sautéed mushroom. The kicker I enjoyed was the fried onions. I added natural cut fries. My burger was very good! My wife's on the other hand was just ok. She got the standard and added sautéed mushrooms as well.   She did not enjoy her burger as much as mine."}
{"text":"best burger in town fo'sho!!!! best spiked shakes i've had in my life, specifically the Blueberry one and the Orange cream flavors. Fries are too crispy, and based on the price of the burgers, should be included. Dark beers on tap...awesome!!! every time i go to vegas, i end up going here at least once. It's in the Palazzo, 2nd level next to the designer shoppes."}
{"text":"Today was actually my first time here and my experience wasn't as bad as most reviews but it wasn't as amazing.  The prices are reasonable! I was surprised to pay what I had to pay because I expected a little more than I did. The person who greeted and took our order was very friendly and answered my friend and I's questions without hesitation or uncertainty.  I ordered the bacon burger, which was delicious! The size was pretty reasonable and I came in there with no food in my stomach and came out very full. I also had sweet potato fries which were just the right amount of sweetness to my taste!   The atmosphere was also very laid-back and there were plenty of seating. The kitchen was also open so you can see them working on the burgers! Which I thought was pretty neat.  I would definitely come back again when I'm at Town Square and try out the other kind of burgers."}
{"text":"My favorite burger spot on the Strip! This is the no-frills burger experience when you just need to get away from the casino floor and replenish. Well maybe there is a frill or two - the garbage fries are a-mazing! Especially after a day of drinking and general debauchery! The mixed drinks are not exactly my cup of tea, but they're not awful either.  BBQ Burger, Garage fries and a soda. You're welcome, vegas visitor."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I always eat here before we go see a movie. There are cheaper places to eat, but we don't even question where we're gonna eat. It's that good. I've never had a bad burger and I've never had bad service. The ONLY THING is the price. Now, I'll pay it, cause I like it and because I like the quality of what I'm getting. And yes I need to have my Oreo Shake. BUT 30.00 for two of us to eat is pushing it a LITTLE, butttt we don't go to the movies super frequently."}
{"text":"A-OK basically sums this place up. We came here for breakfast Friday morning and you feel like you're walking into a giant mushroom house (very strange, I know, but if you go there you'll understand). Lots of staff on hand but the place was practically empty. I ordered the French toast combo; French toast, 2 eggs any style, hash browns and bacon. Replacing the bacon with fruit was an extra $2. Huz ordered an egg white veggie omelette. Food was eh. Kind of what you expect from a diner. Nothing special."}
{"text":"When I walked into the place the first thing I noticed was the fact they sold alcohol! I was surprise as the place looks like a regular fast food place with a face lift. I was very pleased with the customer service; the girl at the register explained the menu to us as soon as we walked in. I'm glad she was so helpful as the menu is not that clear.  The décor was very neat and the cool part is that you can see the chef cooking ur meal. The no so great part was the food.  I was not very impress, I'm sure you can find a better place to eat burgers."}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of my favorite burger places on the strip. Although a little pricey it is well worth it. I would suggest the I love Soul burger."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love Holsteins (at the Cosmo) but decided to try this place after his coworkers recommended it. Although the shakes are far better at Holsteins, the burgers here are far tastier and service faster and friendlier. I had the I love bacon burger and as a bacon fan, this burger was the culmination of all things bacon lovers could ever ask for! They cleverly mixed beef with bacon then wrapped the patty IN bacon topped with cheese! I love spicey and requested jalapeño on top of the cheese which gave the burger an awesome little kick! My fiancé ordered the Kobe burger which he enjoyed... And we had a side of sweet potato fries-- yummy goodness that was crisp on the outside and oh-so-soft and delicious on the inside! Happy eatings!"}
{"text":"3 burgers, fries, onion rings and a shake (lunch for 3) was more than $50.  Food tasted good but we could have eaten at Firefly for that much money. Burger was tasty but on the small side. Sweet potato fries had cinnamon-sugar on them, which I liked but not everyone would. Coffee-bean milkshake was amazing (also $6)"}
{"text":"Worst service and attitude I've ever experience. If you don't want to work  in the service industry it's very easy and simple \"just quit!!\" If you are still working at a burger joint thats means you have no where to go and means this is where you belong."}
{"text":"We found I Love Burgers on the way to out of all places: the Venetian Food Court, on level-2 in the Palazzo.   The restaurant proclaims to love burgers. They also love eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant parmigiana burger is a large sandwich featuring eggplant parmigiana between two round buns. For eggplant parmigiana lovers such as myself, this was heaven for my taste buds.    The fries are served separate from the sandwiches.  Expect to pay $20 for an eggplant parmigiana burger or basic burger sandwich, fries, and bottomless soda. The higher-end burgers cost as high as $17. What is kind of cool is having ranch dressing come with the fries.    I Love Burgers was happening. I felt that the service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Service was soooo slow! Waited about 30 mins for burgers? Burger was bland. Sure everything in Vegas is pricey so $17 for burger is ok but not when it doesn't have much flavor and such a small one. Mac n cheese nom nom... Not good. The Mac n cheese taste like from a cafeteria where they don't even use real cheese.   Good: tater tots was crispy."}
{"text":"To start, it wasn't clear how seating was going to be arranged. No host came up and sat us, no one even told us it was open seating, which left us wandering their dining floor for a good 7 minutes. Finally when we sat down, we were told to walk back to the entrance to place our food order. Thank you for being informative.  I paid 11 after tax for one burger with NO fries. The Inferno + Fried Egg = $10.xx, the combo of fries and drink were an extra $4.00. Didn't seem too bad however I already bought a beer at their bar thus making my drink useless. My friend had ordered fries so I would just take a couple off him.   For an 11 dollar burger, this was a poorly made sandwich, as if they did not know how to properly assemble a burger. (patty loosely formed, bun not toasted (but somehow stamped with their name). The bun literally felt like it came from the refrigerator. It was also very undersized for an eleven dollar burger, it resembles the size of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese from McDonald's, perhaps just a little more height from my egg and my lettuce/tomato.  The flavors were decent though, it seemed they really tried with their housemade jalapeno mayo, and the patty did have the beefy taste that people look for in a burger. However, just a rock solid bun would kill any joy derived from the highlights of their burger.  Sorry to say, but the fries were pure garbage. For 3.29, they really dropped the ball. Can't really pinpoint what it is, however they do not resemble 'fresh cut' at all.   *One more highlight of this place was the bartender, he was friendly enough to give us the happy hour prices for our drinks after sitting there for quite some time. (2nd Star)*   This is my first time eating at I Love Burgers, and surely, it will be my last."}
{"text":"I went around 4pm for a salad.  It took 15 min just to get my order in and another 20 to get my salad to my table.  The restaurant was fully staffed and around 35% full.  Even if staffing was an issue, 20 min to mix dressing with arugula is ridunkulous.  I gave it an extra star because the bartender was nice enough to give me a discount for the wait."}
{"text":"I expected to encounter long lines due to a free burger promotion on this Thursday at lunch time, but the place was not busy.  Though this restaurant has been open for several months, we were told by an employee that no one knows its open because of its location at the far end of the center.  The coupons, I printed 2, were good for standard burgers that come with lettuce, tomato, onion and American cheese plus we shared a soda.  The burgers were tasty, but dry from being overcooked."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the family on Wednesday night. We were seated right away. The ambience is very casual and low key. Server came right away and brought drinks. She was very friendly and wonderful. Except was covering a lot of tables so kinda slow with service. The menu is not extremely large and had decent sounding burgers. Biggest downside is that it is pricey $11-25 per burger and non came with fries. We ordered the loco moco and I love Seoul burger. The loco moco had decent flavor but the portion was on the small side. I thought the Seoul burger was too big and messy. Flavor was just ok. The parties were both large and almost over cooked (medium). We got the Garbage fries with it and asked for no olives. The fries of course came out with olives. The server was flagged and she apologized for the mistake and reordered us another one (took another 10-12mins). The fires were essentially a chili cheese fries with cilantro and jalapeño.   All in all, I was underwhelmed by the meal. I would probably not come back."}
{"text":"So sad, they changed the menu. It's completely ruined the burgers and they don't have the amazing sides anymore. I loved the tots and the sweet potato fries. We tried the fried pickles... Terrible. Didn't even eat one whole piece. (They aren't the chips, they slice them long ways so when you bite into it, you rip the whole pickle out of the fried shell that is around it..) plain fries weren't great, they were just blah. The burgers used to be amazing and juicy and big! I loved the inferno burger.. Now they even changed the lettuce it over powers everything. I won't be back I'm so bummed!!  Staff is great, and the stars are for the shakes, they are the only thing that's wonderful. That and the ketchup. The ketchup is still good."}
{"text":"When my father-in-law came in to town this weekend, my husband and I decided to splurge and go out to I Love Burgers in the Palazzo Hotel. We were greeted immediately by three servers clustered around the hostess stand, and allowed to pick a table in the mostly empty restaurant. Fortunately there were several TVs showing the Sunday night football game, and a selection of booths, pub tables, and regular tables to choose from.   Our server, Alma, was very attentive, patient, and helpful: attentive because she checked in on us frequently; patient because she gave us extra time to order and to finish our meal; and helpful because she offered menu suggestions and brought us extra drinks and sauce throughout our meal.   I ordered the turkey meatball sliders and was MORE than impressed. These not-so-little burgers came with an impressive turkey meatball, hot marinara sauce, and fresh toasted buns, and were literally SMOTHERED in provolone cheese. Wow. I even had extra to take home because I was MORE than filled.   My husband and his father enjoyed their Dante and BBQ burgers as well.   My only complaint would be that the wait time is a little long and the prices are pretty high! However, for a special splurge, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I had probably one of the better burgers I've had in my life here!  We stayed at the Palazzo and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, what a great location!  But, little did we know, inside the indoor mall here was I love burgers!  I can't remember the name of the one I got, but it was the one with Pepperjack, jalapenos and a srichra mayo!  It was sooooo juicy and absolutely delicious after a night of all the terrible things a person does to themselves during their trips to vegas!  The french fries were also very very good!  My husband had a traditional burger and he was also impressed.  So drag your drunk ass out of bed, or not if your still out, and get a burger so the greasy goodness can heal your soul from all the sin you committed while in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"1st let me set the tone and expectations for my review before you read about why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  - You are probably standing outside this place wondering if you should go in or not  So let's be honest here.  If you really just wanted to eat to consume calories, you would have gone to a food court.  If you are craving something fancy and amazingly flavorful then you would not have stopped to read this review either.  I am guessing that you most likely ended up here because you wanted something better than the food court but do not want to deal with fancy restaurant prices or long waits and that means this place might fit what you are looking for.  Lets start with what to expect: 1. think of this like a \"i'm trying to be a fancy Red Robin\" type of experience.  Everything in Vegas will cost you a little more than normal and this place will offer a much larger variety of burgers, shakes, drinks and sides than anything in a food court 2. you obviously did not see a big fat long line of people waiting to eat here so you should already know that Guy Fieri is not in the back cooking your burger.  However, this burger is much better than what you find at a food court 3. So given that you are not going to take a cab to go to Summerlin or Henderson and actually go to Red Robin, then just go in, sit down and enjoy your burger.  If I was solely rating this place for flavor of food, I would give it 3 stars.  Better than any fast food place but nowhere near anyone's top 50 burgers they have ever eaten in their life.  But the burger is not in anyone's \"worst\" list either.  They are cooked to your specifications, my medium rare sliders were juicy and flavorful and my sweet potato fries were ... well, sweet potato fries lol.  So eat here if you are looking for a Red Robin, Johnny Rockets type of burger, DO NOT eat here if you are looking for a Father's Office type of burger."}
{"text":"My wife and I were not in the mood to travel too far from our room at the Palazzo to grab a bite to eat so we chose I Love Burgers. In fact, I think this is the first restaurant we saw after exiting the elevator on the second floor to the shopping area. I Love Burgers looks like a throwback diner or cafeteria with the checkerboard floors along with the rest of the décor inside. My wife and I agreed with the name of the place so we ventured inside to give this burger joint a try.  Burgers: My wife ordered and absolutely enjoyed her Thanksgiving burger. Made from fresh ground turkey and topped with stuffing, cranberries, cheese and gravy, this burger melted away with every bite. It was so moist and delicious! Probably one of the best turkey burgers either of us have tried. My wife had hit the I Love Burgers' jackpot with this burger. She was the big winner while I was the big loser with my order of sliders. The ground beef in these sliders were really dry, tough and could have used more seasoning. The buns were too crispy from being toasted too long. The sauce on these sliders did not add any flavor. Needless to say, I was really disappointed with these sliders. Instead, I had to savor every bite of the Thanksgiving burger that wife gave me.   Fries: I thought the sweet potato fries were interesting. They tasted more like a dessert than a side with the amount of cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on them. These fries came out super-hot so we had time to finish our burgers first before diving into them as a dessert.    Service: It was really busy during our visit and it seemed like they did not have enough staff in place to wait on all the tables. This made the service really slow. I'm hardly ever in a rush but it seemed like an eternity between finishing our meal and getting our check. With that said, we did have a terrific waitress who was really cordial with us. But unfortunately she appeared to be overwhelmed and somewhat exhausted because of the situation. We did not hold that against her and hopefully none of the other customers did as well.  I Love Burgers receives three stars (2 1/2 stars rounded up) from me."}
{"text":"My kids and I had arrived after a long trek from the Bay to Vegas. We probably should have stayed at our hotel and eaten, instead of wandering out. But regardless, we ended up at the Palazzo. My kids couldn't go any farther and they had stopped right in front of this restaurant. I looked at the menu and decided that we should eat there.   It was probably around 8:30 on a Wednesday night. We were seated right away. The waiter came over within a couple of minutes and took our drink order. I was so tired and hungry, I couldn't decide on what to eat. I asked him what the most popular item was on their menu and he said it was their bacon burger. I LOVE me some bacon, but I just wasn't in the mood for it.   I actually ended up ordering the parmesan sliders, they sounded so good! My girls ordered the kids chicken strips and french fries. They kids meals come with a soft drink. The sliders were $11 and the kids meals were $7 each. Not a bad price for dinner at The Palazzo.   The parmesan sliders were really good! It was breaded chicken with cheese. Good flavor and filled me up. I didn't order any sides, but I stole a couple of my kids fries because they said they were good...and they were! Another restaurant checked off the list in Vegas, 1,000 more to go."}
{"text":"Check in on foursquare for FREE nom noms (mac n cheese) which r pretty delicious...comes w/a sauce too! ordered to go here which u do at the bar...the bartender has that im-better-than you attitude....their Chili cheese fries w/mushroom are a little odd...the mushrooms really don't go...food takes a while too...get the spiked milkshakes...they are strong!! u really taste that alcohol"}
{"text":"My family and I come to Vegas 1-2 times a year and this is one of the places that we ALL LOVE to eat (this says a lot for picky 10 & 14 year olds).  All of the food is prepared fresh, the staff is extremely friendly and the service is top-notch!  I Love Burgers has become a daily stop as they serve burgers for BREAKFAST (Who does that?!?)!!!  We LOVE I LOVE BURGERS"}
{"text":"Nice, casual vibe! Our burgers were great! The meat was perfect. Yum! Food came out quick but wasn't hot when it got to the table but they were very busy. Our server Jenny wasn't the best, seemed she was mad to be there. Prices very reasonable for the good they prepare. I love I love burgers!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing this place loves is high prices. They clearly hate burgers. Food was greasy, cold and not worth even finishing. I hope this place closes sooner than later, there are way too many restaurants in Las Vegas that are overpriced and substandard that stay open because they rely on non repeat tourist business."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Prices were decent, drinks were delicious and the food was AMAZING!!! I would definitely come back here again!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever...we ordered 3 burgers and sides..The cashier couldn't even get that right...worst part as we sir and watch the idiots cook all the food we receive ours only to have 3 burgers literally straight from the raw package...they were disgustingly raw..As I sat and contemplated having them redone I realized the realm of employees I was dealing with...either A. Drunk still from New Year or B. Just really don't give a crap about their work  performance at all so i handed it to the cook and advised he might want ti actually cook the meat before servi g it ...he offered to cook them some more but at this point we decided if we had them redone we would end up with \"special sauce\" on them.    So needless to say we ended up with $40 french fries and tator tots.  Never again will I eat there."}
{"text":"They just recently changed their menu and they have definitely downsized it. It lacks the variety it used to have. I used to come for the caprese burger and sweet potato fries but now they have neither. They still have nom noms but their lack of menu options has gotten me really disappointed and I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to stop if you're in Vegas.  The burgers are very good. The shakes are absolutely delicious.  They have the best Loco Moco ( Hawaiian burger, egg, rice, gravy dish) that I've tasted outside of the islands themselves!!!   They have a delicious slider (I Love Bacon and Eggs) with quail egg, that is surprisingly addictive.    My husband and I make the Loco Moco and I Love Bacon and Eggs dishes a MUST HAVE meal every time we drive to (and THROUGH) Vegas.  We suggest you do the same. ;-}"}
{"text":"I dislike this place, first and last time I come here.  It's sad seeing people standing around talking and on their cell phones.  Placed my order and when I got my burger, it was all wrong. I waited an extra 25 minutes for my fixed burger. Not cool. Never again."}
{"text":"12/30/11 DINNER.  I belong to a local Meetup.com group of \"foodies\". We've decided to try various burgers around town. Lots of high-end and low-cost. So I booked a table for 10 here, to give it a try.  To say I was VERY happy with the service is an understatement. As we were a larger group, they offered us the ability to RESERVE in advance as well as table service (vs their standard order-then-sit, which they offer to the gen pop). They were FANTASTIC. Back room, separate checks, constant attention, we must've driven them CRAZY, as like I said, this is a fast-food establishment (order first, get table after), not a dining-with-service place.  The burgers unfortunately were a little disappointing, in that their \"medium\" turned out to be more \"well done\". (We prefer rare to medium rare, anyway.) But this is fast-food, not fine dining burgers like Burger Bar or such. And yes, they were expensive. But the Inferno (the hottest flavored offering of the bunch) was, indeed, HOT! YAY! And the \"I heart Bacon\" was good, lots of bacon on and IN the patty! Both had nice flavor.  But the best thing in the place was the fried pickles! It was the best example of fried pickles we had ever tried. EVER. And then there were the NOM NOMS: deep fried mac & cheese cubes. They were light and flavorful, and the dipping sauce was great.  Oh, and their chopped salad had a CUMIN dressing! In a fast-food burger place! Really fresh and tasty.  So I can't give them a perfect score, but near perfect."}
{"text":"SLOW getting food out, server had too many tables to do anything other than take our order.  Sat for over 45 minutes after placing our order without food or drink refills.  Many tables after us got their food way before us and all we ordered was sliders, chicken strips and fries.  Server kept saying \"just a few more minutes\" and food didn't come out in a few more minutes.  Lots of frustrated patrons waiting and waiting and waiting.  When our food finally came out, the burgers were not cooked as we ordered, the chicken strips were sitting in grease and the fried things tasted like they'd been fried in old grease.  We were in a hurry to get back to our conference so we didnt hwve time to complain. Greasy and not worth the wait or price!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! We were greeted right away by a smiling face, weren't rushed to order, and noticed how incredibly clean the place was! We sat by flat screen tv's, watched ESPN, and before we knew it, in less than 5 minutes our juicy burgers were ready. Even the bun was noticeable delicious! The natural cut fries were cooked perfectly, and my boyfriend had the sweet potato fries that reminded me of a warm cinnamon sugar funnel cake. Yum! While eating we were asked by 3 different staff members, one being the manager, how we were doing. Every answer was muffled by our happy mouths being completely filled. Overall, it was a great, quick-service, delicious dining experience! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday morning & again on a Wednesday morning. Their burgers are excellent, even if the cooking was inconsistent. I'd ordered both of my burgers medium-rare, but the first was barely pink inside. My second burger was very pink - perfect!. I also enjoyed their tater tots, and their bacon bloody mary with both meals. Our first visit here, around 10:30 am on a Sunday, was pleasant. We had an attentive server who seemed to be in a good mood. The service on our second visit, however, during a busy Wednesday morning, was laughable. Paul actually seemed to hate his job. Even though I requested no onions, my burger arrived with onions. When someone at my table mentioned that to Paul, he half-heartedly apologized, with no offer to make it right in any way. THEN, another table-mate realized he never got his sweet potato fries, and Paul's response was that we would only be charged for the food that we had on the table. He did not offer to bring out another order of sweet potato fries. I honestly can't remember another recent encounter with such an indifferent server. Although I wasn't paying the bill (nearly $450 for our table), I made sure no additional gratuity was added to the bill on top of the automatic 18% for our group size. I certainly hope Paul realizes very soon that waiting tables isn't his thing, & finds a job that doesn't involve public interaction. Again, the burgers were very good, and I WILL eat here again."}
{"text":"Can you say nom nom? The mac and cheese nom nom is so good! Ordered that along with the ultimate cheese burger, bacon and egg sliders, pultine fries and fried pickles. Everything was good esp after a night of partying hard. Burgers med rare is aays the best choice. Moist, tender and flavorful.   We took advantage of the 3-6pm happy hour (half price apps, and $5 house wine which I got the white zinfindel yum). Pretty good place to just chill and relax. Our bartender/waiter at the bar, Daryll was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very limited choices, not a huge menu.  However,  everything we choose was pretty good.  Kids meal and burger was awesome.  Got a milk shake too but wasn't my favorite,  but everybody has different tastes.    Staff was hit or miss.  The absolute only person who smiled or was even remotely nice was the man at the front.  Everyone else looked like they were mad at the world.  This gentleman came over to check on use and was super nice to our son.  He's really the only reason I gave this place four stars instead of 3 stars.    I won't go out of my way to eat here but it's a good choice if you're close by."}
{"text":"I ordered Dante burger and parmesan fries. For a joint called \"I love Burgers\" I felt that the name of the place spoke more than the burger ever could. Bobby's Burger Palace definitely has a better blue cheese burger than here."}
{"text":"I'm an avid PostMates user and this place pops up for their $3.99 delivery deal when I'm at work. It's quickly become a go-to, however, I can't comment on the atmosphere of the restaurant itself.  The burgers: These are not overwhelming, greasy, cheese-slathered burgers. Not petite, not enormous, I'd guess they're a 6-8oz patty of something around 80/20 ground beef. The buns are very high quality and nicely toasted, the vegetable toppings crisp and fresh. I've had both the beef and buffalo patties and I can say it's for sure buffalo when you order it. Has a nice gaminess to the taste and when ordered medium rare, is prepared medium rare.  The sides: I can only speak to the tater tots. I like this unique choice and they give you a very, very generous serving. They're well seasoned with a nice crisp, not greasy at all.  I'm giving 4 stars only for two reasons: the size of the drink that comes with the combo is quite small, probably 8oz, and for the portion of tots given, I'd like to get a plastic container of ketchup instead of 81726382 packets. Small fouls compared to some great beef."}
{"text":"I think this is an excellent gourmet burger and a healthy snack too if you get it on a wheat bun which they have upon request."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch.  We didn't have a lot of time and so we sat at the bar.  Yeah I'll admit $17 is a lot for a burger but when you're in Vegas you really can't compare the prices to anywhere else.  If it's in a nice hotel it's gonna be even more expensive.  We weren't super hungry so we decided to use our couple super powers and split stuff.  To start off we ordered ourselves a booze shake.  Blueberry macadamia nut muffin.  So Tasty !!! I should have got the one with extra booze in it. For an appetizer we got fried pickles which really weren't that expensive and we got so many I don't even think we finished them.  Then came our bacon burger.  The bartender that put our order in was nice enough to have them cut it for us and deliver it in separate baskets.  It was pretty tasty and just the right amount of food.  If you're super hungry go to a buffet it's a better deal for your money.  But overall I think the service was great, the food was great and the atmosphere wasn't over the top bouche like a lot of places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I la-la-loved the Ahi burger.  I ordered it and expected it to come out in fillets o' fish but it came out in a seared patty.  It was pretty amazing.  I ordered it with no red onions (however, they brought it out and it had onions then they took it back...they basically just took off the onions and sent it back out...) and added mushrooms.  I'd totally order it again the next time I stop by.  I forgot to buy a t-shirt ):  I also tried the mac-n-cheese cubes and they were pretty yummy but not really something that will fill you up.  Someone in our party of 11 ordered their special bloody mary with bacon...i mean it.  Bacon!  They replaced the celery stalk with a crisp strip of bacon.  Re-read that last sentence because I did not intend to have a tone disgust or anything.  I actually want to go back and try the bloody mary now.  OMG...a crisp strip of bacon in place of a stalk of celery!!!  All in all...recommend and would surely revisit"}
{"text":"The place was clean. A little deserted for a weekend night, though. Checking the yelp reviews I understand why. This place is waaaay overpriced. Okay, yes you are in Town Square. But who gives a crap about Town Square anymore? not me.  The bbq burger was pretty good with the onion straws. My son's grilled cheese looked yummy, he ate it all which is unheard of. I didn't really care for the chocolate shake. It was not frozen enough for me and it went down like melted ice cream. ...Bleck...I'm only going with two stars because it didn't WOW me. I wanted more from them."}
{"text":"I tried one of the spicy burgers ..its ok ..definitely not worth the money they charge you for. Shakes are fries are good .  A decent selection of beer."}
{"text":"I appreciate the fact that they have a veggie burger option. It was filling and not a super duper expensive meal based on Vegas standards. The burger itself was a black bean patty, and included lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion, sprouts, smoky roasted pepper sauce and a whole wheat bun. I added avocado and would definitely add cheese too in the future (an additional $2 for each). The burger could have been a little more flavorful (I've had some really good veggie burgers) and the onions needed some more cooking to actually be considered caramelized. It was also a little heavy on the sprouts but not bad overall."}
{"text":"This spot is OK at best and didn't really live up to my expectations. The appearance is cool and fun but the food just didn't match the atmosphere, not to mention the service was slow and could of been better.   I went with the I Heart Bacon burger with a side of deep fried pickles. The burger was good but nothing spectacular and the pickles were the same. Just didn't have any special flavor that stood out or anything.   My problem with this place is that I was hoping for a kick-ass burger that knocked me off my feet and I just didn't get that here."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim after discovering Tacos El Gordo was packed out. The man went from adobada to Angus in a heartbeat. Located on the 3rd level of the Palazzo, it took a bit of hiking to get to from self parking, but a lovely casino employee pointed us in the right direction. The restaurant is open concept, even at almost 11 pm, they still had a lot of cooks on the line doing their magic to feed the late night crowd of Fourth of July out-of-towners. My man ordered the BBQ burger, medium, I got the Caprese burger, medium rare, and we split garbage fries. My burger was perfect, warm and still a little bloody and very juicy! The Italian spin was outstanding with the basil, mozzarella and tomato. The bun broke up on me, but that's what happens when you order medium rare.  It was still quite nice and tasty! The man said his burger was good...I should have batted my eyes at him for a bite so I could review it on flavor, but it looked yummy as well! The fries were alright, but I think I would have enjoyed plain ones more considering the burger I ordered. It was a bit much. Overall, it was good and I'd go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I joined her family for late Sunday morning breakfast.  Although we sat quickly, the food took an extraordinarily lengthy amount of time to arrive then was either cold or missing items.  In fact, my nephew was the last to receive his meal.  It was a very embarassing situation since we found this establishment and suggested it for breakfast.  The manager ended up comping the meal but would have been nice to actually enjoy a warm, delicious breakfast wiith our family that traveled to Vegas."}
{"text":"I had some friends who were staying at the Palazzo so when we got the afternoon munchies we contemplated on where we should go.. We wanted something fast but not fastfoodish & so we decided on ILBs haha   We shared:  -fried mac and cheese nom noms ($6) came with about 7 pieces.. you really can't go wrong with this.. YUMM -Tuscan kale salad ($12) really basic salad.. just kale, cranberries, avocados & pine nuts -the standard sliders ($11) small but still tasty  Overall I thought the food was about 3 stars but the service was AWESOME.. Our server Jenny was super friendly, made sure our waters were always filled and didn't give us any attitude when we asked if we could split the check..   HOP TIP: If you're going to order a milkshake get it spiked with alcohol.. this is Vegas after-all ;]]]"}
{"text":"I'm going to call I Love Burgers one of the best finds on the strip. You have to search your way through a maze that may rival Labyrinth to find it. DAMN YOU BOWIE!  Once you've walked what seems like at least 6 miles through about 4 casinos and a mall you can sit down and enjoy a hard earned craft beer and a delectable burger.  I got fried pickles and the I Love Bacon burger. I do love bacon so it was the natural choice. The burger was topped with a generous amount of bacon strips and the patty itself was half ground chuck and half ground bacon. I could actually hear my heart whimpering as I ate this gift from the gods.  The fried pickles were good, not great, but I've come to expect that nothing will live up to what i have in mind when I think of DFP's.  If you've got a moment and feel like walking off the calories you will intake I suggest I Love Burgers. That is, if you can find it."}
{"text":"We were at the pool all day and decided to we needed some serious greasy food to balance out all the alcohol in our stomachs.  I've eaten at the I Love Burgers at Town Square before and just thought it was okay so I didn't really want to eat here but I HAD to have a burger stat and did not want to go wandering the Strip looking for another burger place.  I was actually pleasantly surprised.  It wasn't that busy so we got seated right away. I just got my normal Standard with cheddar and bacon, and my friend got the inferno burger with extra cheese.  We also got nom-noms and fried pickles and a triple chocolate shake.  Our food came out fast and it was hot and delicious.  I'm not sure what they do differently here than at Town Square, but my burger was BOMB!  It was juicy and flavorful and seemed a little bigger.  My friend loved his inferno burger!  The service was really great!  Our server Jenny was really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I had never had the noms noms before and she highly recommended them and I was in LOVE with these.  She made sure our drinks were always filled and checked on us regularly.    I'm really glad that circumstances made us come here because we had such a great experience with the food and service.  I'll definitely stop by here again and recommend it to any friends looking for a good burger place on the Strip."}
{"text":"The burgers are OKAY, nothing special.  I've gone in here quite a few times for lunch and sometimes it's better than others.  It's a cute little burger spot over by valet at Town Square.  The menu is very simple.  The last time I was here months ago, each burger had a little description of what it is, but this time it was just simply the name of the burger.  The cashier told me that they had just changed the menu 2 weeks ago and the tater tots were gone.  BOOO!  Those were my favorite.  I ordered the standard, which is just a plain burger for around $3.50, but after adding cheese and bacon, it's about a $7 burger.  My burger was good.  It was juicy enough and had good flavor, though it did not blow me away. My friend ordered the inferno burger, but I did not find this to be special in any way.  The fries we ordered in place of my beloved tater tots were just okay as well. They are thin cut like McDonald's fries and crispy.    The cashier was nice and sweet but there are many times I've come here where other cashiers were kind of jerks.  I like this place every once in a long while but I'd almost rather go to Yard House and get a burger there instead."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The burgers are flavorful and the brioche buns make them that much better. The fries are separate but if you do get them, get the garlic fries. The prices are average but worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"I DEFINITELY love burgers! I had the standard burger with cheese, ultimate sauce and a side of natural cut fries. It was delicious! Check in an receive FREE Mac n cheese noms which is pretty much fried mac n cheese squares (they're a little rough on the stomach, wouldn't recommend them if you're going out later) I  burgers is a great causal dining spot, quick, easy, and tasty!"}
{"text":"Very expensive and not great compared to other places.  Smash Burger and 5 Guys are both much better than this place and half the price."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I got a huge burger with a ton of cheese, the garlic and parm fries, and a gummy bear martini. I was in heaven. I've never had a better burger. I also got a strawberry daiquiri in a huge cup to go and they do not skimp on the alcohol! I can't wait til I'm in Vegas again so I can come back."}
{"text":"Let me tell anyone who reads my review first and foremost, this place is not cheap! For a burger joint it is expensive. Now I can let everyone know about my experience.  I came in with a friend on a Saturday, a day when it is happy hour all day. I didn't really want a beer i was ready to for once, I was just hungry and from the attempts to find this place three other times, I was ready to eat. My friend is what you'd call a glutton, ordering the biggest sized I love Bacon burger and a milkshake. I had the BBQ and regular fries. The food didn't take too long to get to us, the milkshake brought to my friend about the same time I sat down from getting my iced tea. The problem I had with the burger was very simple, it was very plain. I would have loved it a lot more if it had cheddar and more BBQ sauce with it.  No complaints from my friend at all on his burger and he said the Oreo milkshake was very good. We plan to go again, though I wont be paying so no real complaints.  I recommend going on a weekend and trying out the happy hour. Wouldn't recommend taking the family unless you want to spend too much."}
{"text":"Wow. I just gave up on my burger and fries. There was absolutely no flavor and I hate to waste precious calories and stomach room on worthless food.  I had the Dante burger which had cheap blue cheese and a \"garlic aoli\" aka plain mayo. I have never had sweet potato fries that taste like nothing even after a packet of salt and add to that completely flavorless ranch dressing until now."}
{"text":"Great bun, really salty fries. Fun atmosphere, attentive service."}
{"text":"Best burger place at the Palazzo. Reasonable prices and fast service.  If you are looking for a fancy place to eat, this is not it, just great comfort food and friendly service.  Never felt rushed to eat or leave the table, which made it a nice place to visit and hangout with friends.  Love the Loco Moco breakfast!"}
{"text":"My husband had breakfast Hawaian burger, cool, unique different.  I had a milkshake and toast (a bit hungover).  Cool atmosphere and good service (although a little slow when we first arrived to be waited on)."}
{"text":"I like being able to write 5 start reviews. The breakfast here is awesome. And when they say jalapeños, they mean good, wicked-spicy, honest to god, jalapeños. Thanks for serving us with a smile Ashley."}
{"text":"Yep I love burgers, and differently loved the burger I got was the dante; ground angus, blue cheese, caramelized onions, roasted garlic aioli. I think what sold me on this was the caramelized onions and the garlic, freakin love that stuff. Service is really nice here, place is pretty big, and it was located in a nice spot oh and make sure to order the Parmesan garlic fries, fuckin bombdizzy  I think carls jr needs to revise their slogan of 6 dollar burgers because these burgers were well over 10 bux...but worth it imo"}
{"text":"We were at Town Square looking for a new place to eat and stumbled upon this gem. It has a neat atmosphere and so my family decided to check it out. We ordered and then sat outside, and it was a beautiful day. My only complaint is the size of their patio should be larger and the table layout was kind of weird. But, they earn all four stars on the food. My kids shared a grilled cheese (and gave both my wife and I a small bite) it was phenomenal. My wife got the hotdog, which she said was good. I got the I Heart Bacon burger, and I was blown away. The burger it self was delicious and prepared perfectly. I am tempted to say this is the best burger I have ever had, but I have had some pretty good ones in my day so I will hold back on that. But, it was great. The service team there is very good and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited I love burgers in March with a coupon.   Service was impeccable.  Prices are high.  Shakes are excellent (alcoholic shakes available)...we stuck to vanilla and chocolate...burger was phenomenal.  The I love bacon burger was delicious...brisket and beef patty with applewood bacon.  We also ordered tater tots and the fried pickles.  No complaints.  Too much food!  We came back the next day for breakfast--discount with your receipt!  Nice surprise.  Breakfast was reasonable and filling.  Had a breakfast sandwich and piping hot coffee.  If you are in the Palazzo or Venetian...gives this place a try."}
{"text":"So with the opening of a new restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian, the BF tends to want to try it since he works on the property. His lunch break experience here during the soft opening was so bad they had to comp the entire groups meal...I'll add more to that later.   I decide to meet the BF for dinner once he got off work so that he can give it a second chance now that they're a few weeks open.   Beer Nerd Rant ahead-  He noticed on his last visit that there was a few beer bottles on the counter that he did not recognize so we asked for a beer list. There were 3 that we have not seen before and we tried to look it up online to see what it is exactly. We couldn't find it online. Turns out that their names are written wrong. The beer we were most curious of was listed as \"Imperiale Beer Ubi Red\". The REAL name is Imper Ale Ubi Rossa by Birra Tentute Collesi of Italy. The other two Imper Ale listed are also wrong but are the Fiat Lux and Alter Bionda. It was impressive once I found out what it was.. Our server brought out pint glasses.I had to ask for wine glasses because you don't serve this like it's Bud Light, flavors must aerate. It was small wine glasses for Chardonnay, you need large wide glasses like Pinot Noir or Montrachet or a goblet for full flavor. I think you should know and put the right name on beer list and know how to serve high end product correctly. It's beer, but it was a $30 import so it is a fine product. You wouldn't do it with a wine and I'm just saying, fine beers isn't any different. I know they just opened...for future reference (if people who work there read this).   Onto the food.....  We shared two starters:  Mac N Cheese & Yam Fries ($6, each) . This is really misleading since both are under \"gourmet fries\" list. Mac N Cheese are more like breaded fried mac and cheese, not mac n cheese flavored fries. It was nice and gooey in the middle, good panko crust and the southwest cheese sauce it comes with was perfect for it. Yam Fries aren't fries- they're thin sliced as chips. We ordered it with the garlic sauce (server recommends the rosemary goes well with it) and it was a airy crunchiness that is kinda addicting. The kind of thing you can keep on noshing on and not realize how much of it you've been snacking on!   Burgers:  I had the Ahi ($17) which was nicely seared to keep the middle rare. The bun is a taro bun so it's like the sweet buns that most Asian bakeries would make red bean buns with- soft, a bit sticky and sweet. I really liked the sauce on it...it was gingery and had some kick and set off the tuna well.   BF had the Oregon Trail ($17) which is the Buffalo meat burger with a fine aged sharp cheese (cannot remember which right now), garlic aioli. It was juicy and well seasoned, a solid burger.   Service was friendly and pretty good about checking on us.   This is a vast improvement from the BFs last experience. It's my only experience so I'll give them a positive rating since I did have a good meal. Worth the price? That's hard to say as a local with off strip, cheaper options. We obviously get a great employee discount so that made it worth going for us. It was a good burger and if you're a tourist and you're hungry I don't see why not if they get their consistency down, but that might be a while.  BF does not Yelp, but this is some excerpt on his Facebook discussion- an upsetting 1 star kind of experience:  \"to me it just seems like there are too many hands in the cookie jar and the focus becomes to look as busy as possible as opposed to really taking care of the customers...it all seems like a grand illusion they think will keep them from getting fired when the hammer comes down.  you would think with 8 chefs on the grill and the head chef there that they could serve 15 guest in a reasonable time. instead they were all making food for each other. there it was in front of us plain as day:  \"that has to be our burgers...nope those are going into the back. oh those must be them...nope half the grill people left and sat down to eat them with the milkshake girls...\"  He said he would probably give them 2.5 - 3 stars now averaging both experiences, but we'll wait for a 3rd time ( 2nd visit for me) to figure out if this place holds up as a solid place for a burger on the strip or this positive experience was a fluke. A $17 burger should always be top notch.  UPDATE- we had lunch here again and it was pretty decent and alright service so things has improved. The menu changed though and the yam chips are now gone."}
{"text":"I am a multiple times visitor to I Love Burgers, and I would recommend it.  The Burgers and Beer selection are great, bar service is awesome, and the location is good.  it is also not too pricey and breakfast is 25% off if you eat there at lunch.  A good value for the money."}
{"text":"After a nice little shopping spree at the Palazzo shops in Vegas I stop in for a bite because I was hungry. I ordered a salad that I sent back because it was all lettuce ends and over ripe grape tomatoes.  I felt like after all of this bad eating  a salad was needed :( Didn't get to eat one.  The burger was a disappointment as well. Although eatable, it was served lukewarm straight from the kitchen. That is a either a quality control issue or an IDGAF issue either way $17 for a cold burger is WACK. I don't send food back  - so I took it to go, with hope of heating the patty somewhere, but I was super disappointed for this over promoted self hyped burger place.  Please do better. Nice waitresses are a waste if the food is cold when it arrives...."}
{"text":"Decided to meet some friends here for lunch.  This establishment is located in town square.  As we entered the place we were greeted, the staff is friendly and nice, reminds me of a high end fancy Mc Donald's.  You order like you were at a fast-food place.  I ordered the regular cheeseburger classic with skinny fries and it came with a drink all for $15  WOW! right? for burger and fries, kinda pricey.  Honestly i was disappointed.  For the price I paid i was hoping it tasted more like Burger Bar inside Mandalay Bay.  Instead the cheeseburger didn't  taste good at all. I felt like it was your typical backyard burger at your uncle joe's BBQ. Infact uncle joe's burger is probably tastier than I Love burger's burger.  If your looking for good burger i would suggest Grind Burger or Burger Bar or if your cheap go to IN N OUT burger! :)"}
{"text":"Great place to get a burger. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I had the Oregon trail burger with sweet potato fries and it was tasty! !! Definitely we would be back to dine again."}
{"text":"Man! I came here for lunch and was expecting a tasty burger and this place did not disappoint. I had a Steakburger ( C.A.B. with caramelized onions, white cheddar, and a sauce ) and some Garbage Fries ( Fries, cheese, Buffalo chili, jalapeños, green onions, olives ) and it was amazing! There are a few places that I would consider a great burger place and this place is definitely on my list of those places. The price is pretty Las Vegas, which is what you should expect, but I think you get what you pay for with that considered. I would definitely come back the next time I'm staying in the area!"}
{"text":"It was my mission to find a child friendly eatery for my toddler, since we were at Townsquare for a play date. I usually like to knock off bookmarks every time I eat out and this place definitely not on my bookmarks. My first experience here was a couple years back and definitely not that memorable. Service was average, but I was not at all impressed by the food. I ordered the burger kids meal (choices were between a hot dog, burger, or chicken fingers) with sweet potato fries and a side of nom noms.  My kid actually fell asleep, which was good in a way because that usually gives me an opportunity to thoroughly enjoy a meal...mommies and daddies of toddlers can relate!   Nom noms - 8 fried mac and cheese squares with cheese dipping sauce. Pretty good actually. ILB gets kudos for this one. My kid and husband tried these later on at home and they liked it.  Burger - This is just your plain ol' hamburger with green leaf lettuce and a slice of tomato. I do like the freshness and quality of the veggies, but seriously I ordered a burger...and I expect the beef patty to be the star. The patty itself was too small for the rest of the burger. It was tasteless and dry. I took a couple bites and was annoyed. The burger was for my son, but I'm allowed a taste test right? When my son woke up and finally tried it, he spit it out. Condiments could not even help this sad burger.   Sweet potato fries - Sweet! Maybe a little too sweet. These fries are dusted with some kind of cinnamon, brown sugar mix. I think with a little refinement, these fries could be better.   The interior is decent in regards to space. There are several different areas to dine, a bar area, a patio area and I swear I saw a private room. I don't think this place ever gets too busy, so you can pretty much enjoy your meal a good distance away from the next patron.   Bathrooms were clean and decent and had a changing table. My only pet peeve is that there is a mirror that I am only able to see my forehead and above. Wtf? I am not that short.   They offer happy hour, but only on alcoholic beverages. It would have nice to have some apps included in that happy hour.   Overall, we won't be back. Not even sure why I came back after all those years. There are better places to eat at Townsquare. Do your research first!"}
{"text":"Pretty average burger experience. Not that bad, not that great. Ordered the regular burger w/an egg. Asked for medium rare, but got medium-well done. Also tried the sweet potato fries (yum!) and shoestring fries (not so yum...oily and couldn't taste the potato-ness) with the red pepper aioli and special sauce (both were tasty). Also had a sip of the blue berry panshake (weird, tasted like breakfast in shake form). The worst thing was that they were totally understaffed. 1-2 servers and no one to fill water or check up on how we were doing. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. This was the first time I had been there. I had the caprese burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was very good but kind of messy. The sweet potato fries were very good. My daughter had the bacon burger and regular fries. Her burger tasted very good. The fries were a lite bit under seasoned.  We asked for to go containers and were also given to go cups which I thought was very nice. I wasn't wowed by this place but it was a decent quality and will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about...this place was good, they had basics and some jazzy things and shakes were good as well."}
{"text":"The food, location, and price deserve 4 stars in my opinion but the extremely choppy service brings it down.  Location The location is great! It is within the palazzo which makes dining for guests really easy. The overall restaurant has a ton of room which can accommodate a good amount of people without making anyone uncomfortable.  Food I got the breakfast sliders which were delicious! The burger was cooked nicely, the bread was toasty, the egg was runny, and the aioli pulled it all together. I also tried their garlic parmesan fries which were nice.   Service I don't even want to relive how bad the service was. Let's just say it completely ruined our experience here.  Tip  If you're a guest check the room for coupons!"}
{"text":"The tater tots were the only thing worth going to this place for. Burger was just ok and my husband got very sick off of it."}
{"text":"This place is awsome! Our server Tracee was so prompt and helpful, funnie as well. Lol the burgers were so good, we will be back here again."}
{"text":"The best thing about I (heart) Burgers is the prices.  Happy hour goes until 8pm with all apps 1/2 price and good drinks specials (I went with the $6 pitcher)  Two red flags popped while I was there.  1.) It was a Friday night at 630 PM and there was NOBODY there, not a good sign.  The bartender claimed it was because the PBR Championship was in town but I wasn't buying it.  She then said it was like that the day before.  Not good IMO if you are empty Thursday and Friday, especially in a place that gets tons of traffic like Town Square. 2.) They don't ask how you would like your burger prepared.  I guess I was expecting more than a Johnny Rockets or 5 Guys type preparation process, but that might have been my fault.  Overall, it's quick and the price is right, especially for half off apps and cheap drinks."}
{"text":"At first glance, this looks like a cool restaurant. It's designed uniquely and decorated with off the wall things like fake grass on the walls.    It all goes downhill from there though.    I ordered the I Heart Bacon & Egg sliders ($14).  Out came 3 perfect little burgers in a row that had bacon, bacon mayo, fried quail egg and fried onion that looked amazing.  Looks were extremely deceiving!  The burgers were so dry and flavorless.  Not even bacon could save this one.  I tried a bite of their ultimate cheeseburger ($22) and it was basically a glorified Big Mac but with less taste.  It was 2 dense beef patties smothered in cheese and sauce.  Our side dish was a sad looking handful of French fries ($6) and you could tell they don't use fresh potatoes.  I know you're always going to pay more for food in Vegas but with the price tag, I expect quality food.  The food here is extremely overpriced for what you get.    What killed my experience here was that not only was the food disappointing but the service was terrible.  We had to wait forever to place our order and then again to get the check at the end.  If we needed a drink refill or anything, we literally had to wave someone down.  This restaurant seems like it has potential, but it needs some major work."}
{"text":"For a place called \"I Love Burgers\", their burgers do not have much flavor, their garlic fries are not very garlic-y, and onion rings bready with not much pop. More what I'd expect from a $2-3 no-name greasy burger joint than a gourmet burger place at the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Despite being in a top-notch Vegas hotel, I Love Burgers just doesnt offer a decent meal selection for its patrons. The burgers are plain and overpriced. The reviews below exclaim at how huge the burgers are, and I seriously question their depth perception. Sure they're big...if you stare at them 3 centimeters away. I've had larger-sized burgers at my local diner for a fraction of the price.  Don't bother getting their signature bacon burger either. For 17 bucks you get a patty with bacon bits along with strips of bacon on top. The problem is that you cant even distinguish the bacon taste in the bacon, and the bacon on top masks over everything anyway! They should call it the \"gimmick burger\" instead. Fries aren't even included in the order!   +1 star for having Killian's Irish Red on tap. It's the only thing I enjoyed on their menu."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good burger? Non traditional ones too! There is something for everyone at I Love Burgers and the prices are right! Located in the oh so classy Palazzo Hotel, it's nice to have a place we can afford to eat at!  My husband and I enjoyed all that we ordered. Ahi Burger and Leghorn Burger were packed with delicious flavors. The Parm fries were crispy and good!   Everything was fresh and fantastic. The servers and chef do their best to make sure you're satisfied. After our meal, my husband and I were in the mood for dessert but nothing on the menu called out to us. We mentioned to our waitress that we were craving crepes. She asked the chef and dude whipped up something special for us. He even came out to make sure we liked it. That's super impressive customer satisfaction.   Thanks I Love Burgers! We enjoyed everything, nom nom nom!  I'd definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I Love this place...all grass fed meat. Everyone is nice and helpful with ordering. Good burgers!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the service from Sandra has been great with an exceptional greeting. The food is ok, and the service overall ok. They are lacking in the area of cleanliness overall.The restaurant and fountain needs a good deep cleaning and they need to be better at cleaning the tables during their busy lunch time."}
{"text":"This place is really good. A little overpriced but good. Reminded me a little of a Smashburger but not smashed and better ingredients. The best part that I loved was the Sweet potato fries. I got the vegetarian burger which was good wish it had a bit more on it to help replace the loss of the meat but overall tasty. I loved the hamburger buns that they use almost so much that I was questioning going up and seeing if they would just let me buy a bag of those. This place just opened up in Town Square which is a nice addition. When we went we had no idea it was only their second day open because it was running quite smoothly. Another great thing about this place is that it is great for kids cause as you wait for your food the walls have that chalk board paint so kids can play and write on the walls to help them be preoccupied while the food comes. They have plenty of TVs which were on the football games when we arrived. When I am back in town or at the town square I will defiantly go back here for lunch. NO DOUBT!!! I wish there was one in my original hometown."}
{"text":"At first glance it appeared to be a good choice for a burger, a little strange a burger place being in the Palazzo but, I figured I would go with it. It took a while for my server to take my order. after waiting about twenty five mintutes for my Bacon burger it was over cooked and honestly for 17 bucks a complete disapointment. It does not come with fries, those are 7 bucks and are not worth the money either. I'm not sure how much potatoes are right now but, they warrent a high price such as this. On the good side of my trip I visited Holstiens in the Cosmopolitan and had  amazing burger and paid 15 for the burger and it was only 3 bucks to add fries. I will not return to I Love Burgers, thier food is sub par and they need to change thier name to We Love Your Money            *********Buyers Beware*******"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not at all comfortable. (hard chairs and laminate tables) We tried the buffalo and the angus. It gets two stars because I am a burger and hot dog aficionado. Nothin special about this place. Even the sweet potato fries and chips were ho hum. And what's in that stringy sticky dippin sauce?"}
{"text":"I work in town square and this is the best place for burgers!!  They have great veggie burgers too!  Salads, fries, and shakes...yes please!  Good prices too!"}
{"text":"We are locals but we came here with friends . . The service was awful our waitress was rude & un attentive   We started off with drinks their frozen daiquiris were good! Then we had the fried mac and cheese nom noms omg they were really good!   My burger however was terrible I ordered a cheeseburger with everything it came with bacon which was an add on I had never mentioned it also didn't come with fries ? What kind of burger doesn't come with fries? If you want fries be sure to ask for them when you order  . . It was also cold and under cooked the middle was dark pink. . The cheese on the burger was scare In all it was a terrible burger which makes me think that they Don't Love Burgers. I won't be going back :/"}
{"text":"So 6 of us came in on a Friday night. Loved the food and the fact they had a full bar. The truffle fries and vegan friendly service was awesome. The only thing was the staffs acceptance of a regular named \"Jesus\". He was friendly at the beginning of the night but grew more and more intolerable as the night progressed. His lack of boundaries and inappropriate touching was and is the reason we left and won't return. When we asked the staff about the regular who was driving customers away the response was \"he spends a lot of money here.\" As a restaurant manager with 20 years experience, I understand how that thinking occurs. But after watching 4 different tables become annoyed with him and then leave (some without receiving their already paid for food) I can't imagine how much money was lost. Throw into the mix that the female patrons in my party felt unsafe around him, I am lost for words. I would gladly come back and frequent the establishment more, if I found out \"Jesus\" wasn't there anymore."}
{"text":"Been curious to try it since I saw the bacon burger but I have to say I was a little disappointed. Nothing to special about the burger. I do have to say the aioli sauce was very good but overall nothing special. The truffle fries were ok but could have used a little stronger truffle flavor. Disappointed in the shakes.. Not a bad flavor but watery like chocolate milk. Don't think I will return. Plenty of other burger places that I have been more impressed with."}
{"text":"The burger gods were not on my side in Vegas. Though the reviews for here should have been an indication of me to stay away from there the damn free nom noms when you check in made me want to give them a try. The first glace is cute, what girl doesn't like hearts and bright colors? Once you get in it has a cafeteria feel with small tables and dirt everywhere. The white walls scuffed up, the seats sticky and facing the wall, not quite a nice view. Waitress took her time getting to us. So long in fact that the couple next to us ordered, got their food, sent it back and left before we got to order (from the same darn waitress!) We had just ordered the nom noms and were debating the eat those and leave, give them a chance or just leave, but after seeing how tiny and sad the burgers looked that the couple next to us got, we got up and dipped out. Seriously, the $22 ultimate double cheeseburger was the size of a big mac and the I love bacon burger like the $1 bacon burger at Burger King. I hope they close soon and use this space for something better."}
{"text":"Great burger quick simple and delicious got the onion rings (recommended highly) and a burger RYAN waitress was great she's a great server and advocate for the establishment"}
{"text":"Overall, average experience. With family, we were able to survey 5 burgers between us. Heres what we found: Fairly dry burgers, not enough flavor; potential was high but was a bit of a letdown. The fries I had were pretty good, but again, nothing substantial. As I write this, we're combining two burgers to make one that's decently good! The Oreo milkshake is pretty damn good, so keep that in mind. Wouldn't make a special trip for this shop unless you're grabbing food before a movie"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience here. We split an ILoveBacon (Burger). A juicy hand-formed patty that had bacon pieces mixed in, two slices of bacon on top, bacon-mayo, crispy onion straws and GOUDA cheese! It is up there on the top-tasting burgers I've ever eaten. We also ordered a 32oz spiked frozen pink lemonade for $13. The waiter split it into 2 16oz glasses for us which would have been $10 a piece. Since this was our first meal at a sit-down restaurant we were not yet aware of the generosity of this waiter. We later came to find out that a meal does not get split in Vegas without an additional fee.   I'm glad we had a different experience than a lot of yelpers, we went around 10pm, perhaps the lack of customers attributed to our positive experience?"}
{"text":"I was a bit reluctant to try I love Burgers due to the average reviews that it's got but I decided to give it a shot anyway and I have to say that I liked it..   With a bar area, bright colours, TV screens along the wall, a combo of tables/couches and long tables/chairs; it's a cool spot to both grab a burger or hang out over drinks, depending on what you fancy when you're there. I think it's cool and I wouldn't mind returning next time.   I had the standard burger w/ their natural cut fries and the burger was pretty good. The fries were ok, nothing wow but not rubbish either. Our waitress was very nice and friendly.  I guess the letdown is the price however I reckon you should at least try it. You can then decide, based on your own personal experience, whether it's worth it or not..."}
{"text":"So so. Don't have salmon quarter pounder. Too little for too much money. Lettuce wrap or protein style not possible. Burgers are ho hum. There are better burger places."}
{"text":"I got the Oregon trail burger which is a buffalo burger with cheese, tomato, onion, lettuce, and garlic aoli. It was $18 and didn't come with fries...wtf! And the meat needed more flavor. Boyfriend got two apps (50% off...happy hour). He got Nom Noms (fried Mac n cheese cubes) and garbage fries (fries covered in chili, jalapeños, cheese, green onion). He said they were ok. Good bar selections. Normal drink prices. Staff is very very friendly. I'll be back to try different burgers and hope that I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean environment. Friendly service. Affordable prices. Full bar.   Standard burger with extras are my choice. Tasty burger, and very tasty truffle fries. Would recommend to anyone who's in the mood for a burger.   Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The caprese burger with balsamic shoestring potatoes was really very good. The service here is great, nice, happy hard working people. Its a nice alternative to the standard Las Vegas restaurants. Much like everything else in the Palazzo its expensive especially for a burger place but that aside its worth a stop. I also liked that you can get a beer not always available at a burger joint."}
{"text":"The burgers were good, but for these prices they had better be.  The tatter tots were the same as I make at home. I enjoyed the Tahitian vanilla bean milk shake, but again, for that price I would expect no less.    Service was prompt and friendly.  We had no problem getting a seat.  Unlike some places on the strip, this one isn't blasting music you can't hear over."}
{"text":"my husband ordered a milkshake and I ordered a draft beer. By the time they arrived the milkshake was half melted, the draft beer was luke warm, and there was no lime provided with a negro modelo. Really? This was at 11am on a Saturday! Did I mention they were out of shoestring fries, dill pickels, and chips? The meat was pretty tasty .... if they could get the order correct. I won't be suggesting this place to anyone. There are much better options for a burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved every bite of our burger here!  We we're looking to sit somewhere a little less formal - which seemed to be every restaurant inside Venetian and Palazzo - since we were with a toddler.  Came across this place and without yelping we gave it a try since it was getting late and we were out of options.   Sat promptly, it was busy but not very and the place is rather big so I can't see it getting full.  Waitress was attentive and took our order right away.  She brought the kids meal out sooner when we told her our daughter was hungry.  We both ordered the standard with sauteed onions and mushrooms.  Mine medium well and his medium rare.  They didn't take long and when they came out they were perfectly cooked.  Tasted absolutely amazing.  Sure it was a $15 burger but we expected that based on where we were.  All in all the bill came to $45 for two burgers, two soft drinks and one kid meal.  Steep but memorable burger."}
{"text":"What makes this place such a poor choice is all the other amazing burger joint in Vegas. We were there 5-28-13 around 9pm and sat at the bar for dinner. The self proclaimed \"world's greatest fried pickles\" were solid but the ranch to dip them in tasted processed, artificial, and gross. The garbage fries were a pile of ok bar fare, but nothing special. Now the kicker, THE BURGER WAS A UNSEASONED HUNK OF JUNK. It looked so tasty too, but had ZERO flavor. Bun not toasted, meat was unseasoned and had no crust, and the roasted peppers had no flavor and were cold.  Go to Bachi Burger, Burger Bar, KGB, BLT or Sin City Burgers. ALL ARE BETTER THAN THIS JOINT. So is Fat Burger, In and Out, BLT Burger and Holsteins. What I'm saying is don't eat here."}
{"text":"Not good. I've been to this place twice and both times I walked out hungry and disappointed.   When you walk in there is a friendly hostess (or girl behind the counter). She was helpful when I ordered answering my questions. I ordered a burger and fries and a soda. I took a seat and waited for my burger. The guys making the food looked busy and it smelled like burgers, so I was hopeful.  My burger came and it looked decent, but one bite and I was not happy. It was the most dry burger I've ever had. I put a whole packet of mayo on it and a bunch of ketchup... still super dry. The bun was about twice the thickness of the meat, so I had to take off half of the bun. The meat was overcooked and cold. It was as if they cooked the burgers then put them in the fridge and then tried to reheat them when serving them. I ordered blue cheese on my burger and it had no flavor. Blue cheese with no flavor! WHAT!  I then moved onto the fries in hopes that I wouldn't have to go hungry because the burger was not edible. The fries were cold and flavorless. Even ketchup couldn't save or help these fries. I drank my soda and said to my fellow diner, \"at least the soda is good\" my friend then replied \"how could they screw that up!\" Well I went for a refill before leaving and that time the soda was only soda water with  no syrup.  It is in your name... I *heart* Burgers... come on you should be able to make a burger! I will not ever go back. It was a waste of money and time!!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that its grass fed beef, which is so much better than conventional corn or soy fed beef with add hormones. A the best bet is a burger combo which will set you back about $15 that includes choice of fries and a unlimited fountain drink.   Tho the burger patty was decently thick. The burger it self was small. I tried the truffle fries and regular natural cut fries they were good and crispy but it was Luke warm when they brought it to us. I like my fries hot off the frier it tastes much better that way.   It was kind of hard to find the place in the town center. Had to circle around a few times to find it. It was quite empty when I went Monday early evening. I definitely will try it again, the burger itself did taste good just a bit small for the cost. I had their regular burger with caramelized onions and avocado."}
{"text":"Hungry to the point where our stomachs were starting to ingest themselves, a few friends and I stopped into I Love Burgers for an early dinner. We were greeted by a super friendly hostess that quickly seated us and gave us menus to peruse. I noticed that each burger was priced around $15 and didn't include any sides, which struck me as being a bit odd. No matter. After a few minutes browsing their delicious-looking options, I ordered the Standard with Pepper Jack cheese and mushrooms, as well as a side of Parmesan fries. I figured $6 for a side of fries was pretty steep, but just having entered the US mere hours earlier I had a hankering for the classic all-American meal, so I ponied up the extra cash. My friends must have thought the same thing, as we were all giddy with excitement for our meals.  Not long after, our waitress brought out our (massive!) dinners. It doesn't say this on their menu, but a \"side\" of fries is actually an entire basket. Had we known, my friends and I would have easily split them, so take note! As for the food itself, the burger was tasty, although not $15 tasty. As for the fries, they were a bit too thinly sliced for my taste, but that's just me.  I know what you're thinking: \"Sarah, you're giving them only two stars, so there must be more to the story. Out with the juicy details!\" Alright, alright. I just needed to write this preamble to collect myself. Brace yourselves...  When I went to the women's washroom, there was no soap in the dispenser. Gross, yeah, but it happens from time to time. What made me feel REALLY grossed out was that the staff use the same bathrooms as the customers, so how could they not notice the soap was out, unless...? No! I don't even want to entertain that thought. Of COURSE food service workers wash their hands after using the restroom, right? RIGHT?"}
{"text":"Happy hour! Happy hour! Happy hour! With so many mixed reviews on this place, my friend and I thought it would be best if we gave ILB a try during their happy hour. Monday through Friday from 3pm-8pm they do half off draft beers, martinis, and appetizers.   The offering for happy hour is weaker than the other options in Town Square. The appetizers are not enough to fill you up and even if you ordered a couple it is all fried food. After a few items, we called it quits.   The onion rings are some of the best. The outside is a nice golden brown. The coating possessed a solid crunch factor and helped maintain the integrity of the onion within. The Nom Noms were also very good. Fried mac'n'cheese bites are always welcome. The Hebrew National hot dog with fries should be passed upon. As for non hh offering, we shared the BBQ Burger. It was a good burger. I can see why people complain about how expensive they are. Especially since it is this awkward half fast food, half dine in set up. If I had to classify ILB, it would be grouped with Five Guys and Smash Burger. In the end, I could have went elsewhere for a better burger."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious appetizers and the burgers are good too. If you're looking for a place that is not fancy give it a try."}
{"text":"We went after a day of walking around SHOT Show at the Sands Convention center...so we were pretty hungry. There's not much of a menu, staff was pleasant and helpful, the place looked kind of like a cross between a 50's burger joint and a cafeteria. We ordered the New York style chips with secret sauce...they weren't bad, the sauce really helped them. We also got a triple chocolate shake and a bacon burger. The shake was good, nothing special. The burger was done past the medium we had requested and it was really small...the taste was decent but I won't go back again or recommend it to anyone. With all the new burger places popping up in town you'd think they'd get their act together. If they don't they won't last very long. Oh and those 3 items we ordered came to $30. Not worth it. I should've gone to Smashburger:)"}
{"text":"It was OK, I got the classic which was appropriately unexciting.  They had some interesting choices, but after coming in from what was officially the longest 2,000 mile flight ever, I wasn't in the mood for anything remotely adventurous.    Not much really to say, the burger was alright, the fries were acceptable, and it came out quick.  Service was friendly at the bar, no complaints there either."}
{"text":"Finally after 2 days of un healthy food here in vegas I had a great soup n salad here. Mediterranean  salad was great. My husband has a burger which was juicy n tasty but I was just tired of fried food."}
{"text":"Great service and a really unique Korean Kim chee burger plus awesome shakes means this is a place to go back to.  Reasonably priced for vegas too.  Good stop post drinking fun. The nom noms are outstanding as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Amazing. First time here and I can't wait to come back. (Of course I'll have to hit the gym for a week to justify it) I ordered their signature I heart bacon burger with truffle fries.  The place is family friendly and the staff are courteous too. If you like burgers, you have to come here. Be warned, all other burgers will be a disappointment from here on after."}
{"text":"We took a larger party here for a group celebration. Kenneth the manager and his crew could not have been any nicer or given better service!  The food and drinks were perfect for our night!  I highly recommend for a big group!"}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show and this place was highly recommended by some of the convention attendees.  But a quick note I learned on my visit to the \"I Love Burgers\" restaurant at the Palazzo Hotel ....the restaurant was in the middle of a long soft opening and they were still fine tuning the tastes, servings, servers, and prices of the menu. I will explain how I found out it was a soft opening. With that in mind, I actually l gave the restaurant more forgiveness than I would give most other restaurants.  The talk from some of the attendees was the \"I Love Bacon\" gourmet burger. The restaurant's menu explained the burger as \"..a blend of ground sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda, onion strings, and brioche-style bun\".  The burger was a wonderful blend of meaty flavors. I liked the burger because I Love Bacon, but honestly, for the a la carte burger, it was $17 (See my pic).....if you want more toppings than stated on the menu, other toppings like caramelized onions, jalepenos, mushrooms, extra bacon, etc cost an extra $1-$7 per extra topping....OH NO....and I still needs the fries!  Since we still have to purchase the fries, the restaurant actually has a list of gourmet fries to suit any taste. We chose the regular fries and the Parmesan Garlic fries. The regular fries were better than the non garlic fries. We mentioned to our server that the garlic fries were cold and it lacked the taste of garlic. The server apologized, but that is when I learned it was a soft opening of the restaurant. They did not charge us for those fries.....THANK YOU!  These are gourmet burgers, it was tasty, but I wish the prices were more visitor friendly. I know this is a Vegas Strip restaurant and the prices are justified, but I will probably find another place next time around.  Three Yelp Stars!"}
{"text":"I always love great burger! When I saw I love burger, I thought this must be really good. Unfortunately, their basic cooking needed lots of work.  The patty was cooked too much almost burnt but inside was little pink, it was really weird but all I can say was the meat was very dry.  I also had the loco moco, this is one of their speciality but I was surprised when the rice was undercooked, I mean really undercooked. But their kimchi on the side was really surprisingly good. The service was good."}
{"text":"So they have a foursquare check-in special...and the geniuses behind the counter don't even know what foursquare is.  Nor could they find the manager for help, so everyone in my party didn't get that she gave us a $1 off instead. =bad training bad management  They also have different burgers here then their other location aka no Turkey Burger or no Buffalo Burger it was one of the 2 b/c that's all I eat. No bueno. Not happy *again*  Next, this is a burger place HOW IN GOD'S great earth do you run out of KETCHUP. That's just a plain old sin! That should never happen= bad planning bad management   Burgers and ketchup are like best friends. Fries and ketchup are too.  shame I say shame.  Burger was OK, not life changing, probably would've been better with...you guessed it, KETCHUP!"}
{"text":"I got a BBQ Chicken Salad and it was good, but it was soggy because of the water when they had washed the lettuce."}
{"text":"This place is way better then B&B Burgers! Loved the Dante Burger.  The service was expectacular! 100 % recommended!"}
{"text":"So they apparently just opened recently over at the Palazzo. We had a group of 6 and were immediately seated for lunch...place wasn't too busy. We started off with the milkshakes. They can liquor up any of the shakes, so we of course opted for it...perfect way to start the day, right? :) Milkshakes were AMAZING. They use Haagan Dazs ice cream and the coffee milkshake mixed with some Kahlua and Bailey's was pretty awesome.   For appetizers, we decided to share the sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and fried dill pickles. Not too bad, pretty standard. Our favorite was the truffle fries. Had a nice kick to it. They also brought out bacon aioli, garlic aioli, and ketchup. The garlic aioli was pretty tasty and went well with the fries.  As for burgers, I ended up getting the \"I Love Bacon\" burger after hearing a nice sales pitch from our waiter. Mmmm, I gotta say, I do love bacon, but this was a little overwhelming. Bacon mixed in the patty, with bacon strips on top, and bacon mayo. By the time I was half-way through the burger, I felt pretty sick, and the burger started tasting super dry from all the salt. I guess it's a good way to get bacon-lovers to take a nice reprieve from bacon-binging. My buddies enjoyed their burgers, especially the ahi burger on a taro bun.   As for service, it was very friendly, but super slow. It took about an hour for our burgers to come out. We ended up asking for our fries early because we needed SOMETHING to eat. And they also mixed up our order. We ordered a drink that never came out as well. So I guess still a little hectic.  The menu itself is pretty simple. The waiter mentioned that they were planning on adding some new items. Hopefully they can keep up with their orders!  Would I come back? It's a maybe. I definitely won't order the bacon burger again. Overall, I thought it was okay. Prices weren't steep, typical Vegas strip."}
{"text":"If you don't love this place, we can't be friends!!! The I love bacon burger is 5 mins of bliss!!! Or 10 however fast you find your self eating. I'm however hugely appreciative of the fact that over the time I have been coming here and ordering salads I have not yet to find one!!!! Not one piece of welted lettuce. Everything is always fresh which is nearly impossible to find in this city. And it's just icing over everything that the staff is laid back and accommodating... Follow the yellow brick road to I love burgers..."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad! My friend works here so I decided to come in and visit. The staff is friendly and helpful. Burgers are good, but I feel like they're a little too expensive. I'd probably go back - but with my parents so I wouldn't have to pay for anything (haha). The tater tots are good, but saaaaalty which was kinda lame. I wanna try some of the other burgers since the last time I went I just got a standard burger. I had a bite of the salmon burger though and it was pretty good.  However I will say this: nothing compares to a burger from the Counter. If I had to choose between this place and the Counter, I would still choose the Counter.  I do like that they have free wifi though!"}
{"text":"I was prepared to not love it here based on a bunch of low ratings from respected Yelpers.  But their Tuesday happy hour from 3pm-8pm which included $2 draft beers, half off all the appetizers, $2 off all specialty cocktails AND THEN buy one get one free burgers from 1pm-5pm could not be passed up!  So commenced our one meal day at 4:30pm to a mostly deserted restaurant.  I was bummed when \"Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza\" closed down at this location about a year ago.  They've kept the same set up and it was a nice enough day to open up the front bar area to the patio so we sat there.    Thanks to other reviews, we were aware that the burgers were kind of small so we went with the \"more to love\" size but it came off looking like a standard size burger.  We didn't opt for fries since they wanted regular price ($5) for them.    Why get fries when you can get the \"mac and cheese nom noms\" for $2.50?  These babies were five stars by themselves.  Those cubes of breaded and deep fried macaroni and cheese had to be one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  Total bang for buck.  We had two orders!  On to the burgers, I went with the \"I Love Bacon\" which was a blend of sirloin and applewood bacon patty with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda and onion strings on top.  No point in going half assed on burgers when you can go all the way!  Maybe they should finish off the plate with a syringe full of liquid bacon fat stuck on top of the burger.   Unfortunately, the brioche bun was kinda dry and the patty came off that way as well but I figured all the applewood bacon in the patty made it so.  Not great but I'm fine with paying $4.50 for it.    My wife got the standard burger which was a little more well done than she preferred.  We didn't realize until later that this was the only \"upscale\" burger place that didn't ask us how we wanted the patty done.  Kinda weird.  Again, this burger wouldn't be worth it at regular price but it was acceptable for the hh price.    The bartenders as well as the rest of the staff were friendly.  I would only come back here for the noms and $2 beer on Tuesdays.  Any happy hour that goes until 8pm is an excellent one.  2 stars if I were dining here during \"regular priced\" hours but it must be bumped up 1 if not 1.5 more stars for the great deal."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices!  It's from 3-6PM and all their appetizers are half off!  I ordered the garbage fries which are topped off chili, jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, black olives and cheddar cheese and it was a little over $4.  The fries were pretty good and definitely filling.  Decent for the happy hour price but I don't think their quality of food is worth their normal listed price."}
{"text":"After a long flight came here for lunch after I checked in at the Palazzo. Had the Mac And Cheese Nom Noms, the Ibacon Burger and Parmesan Garlic Fries. Their burgers where amazing. Good atmosphere, good service I just think it was overpriced"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers!  Love the variety.  One of the guys working behind the bar told us to put one of our fried pickles on our burger, and that was the best advice I had heard during the entire trip to Vegas.  It's the simple things in life."}
{"text":"I understand everything on the strip is pretty much expensive..came here got the standard burger and added cheese and avocado...burger ended up becoming a $15 burger..decent size..patty was dry for me..but what bothered me the most was the amount of avocado..you would expect paying for $2 to add on avocado that you would get a decent proportion.i got 3 small slices..here's what saved this review..their fried macaroni and cheese was delicious and their garbage fries was good too..yet I don't think I would come back for their burgers ever again.."}
{"text":"Made to order burgers, cant go wrong with that! Cute place located in Town Square located near the AMC Theaters. A pretty good size menu with burgers, sides and drinks.  I come here when I'm craving the Caprese Burger. A 1/3 lb fresh certified angus beef burger cooked to your liking. Topped with fresh mozzarella, beefsteak tomato, fresh basil and balsamic reduction... If you love Caprese Salad like I do, you should try it as a burger with a side of sweet potato fries or truffle fries! It's oh so yummy! And the serve Coke products!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are very dry, no flavor in the meat at all. Onion rings & fries are good. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Had the Loco Moco as a late breakfast item. Great recovery food. Garbage Fries were not as expected but helped to line the stomach for the expected drinking to occur."}
{"text":"So, this place. Located in the back corner of Town Square, stands out from the surrounding places. A) It's super close to the main parking lot in the back and B) It's sign I Love Burgers can be seen from the parking lot, making you crave burgers on the spot. Trust me, it's exactly what happened as I seen it.   The atmosphere in the place is pretty low-key. It has indoor and outdoor seating areas, which is nice. You also don't have to walk through a door to get to the outdoor area, which is double nice. You just walk outside from the inside. Ta-da! Done. I'm assuming they shut that during Winter, but you know what, there really isn't a winter in Vegas anyway. There are chalk board walls scattered around the area whit random drawing on them which makes it pretty unique.   Service is good. There isn't much to be done. You order when you walk in, take a number, and if you are sitting down they come find you, then give you your food. Ta-da. It's more of a \"fast-foodsie\" place, so everything is self serve, besides for the food.   The food is decent. I've been roaming around the city for a good burger off the strip and have yet to find it. This places burgers are decent, but nothing to write home about. They are decently big and appropriately priced, at around 6-7 dollars depending on which one you get. I got the BBQ and was okay. With a name like BBQ, I thought there would be a lot more barbecue sauce on it then there actually was. The burger itself is comprised of: Lettuce, Tomato, American Cheese, Applewood-Smoked Bacon, Fried Onion Straws, and Homemade BBQ Sauce. I could hardly taste the BBQ sauce, since there was only a dab of it in the middle, which was horribly outnumbered by the bacon and onion straw taste.   I also got an order of sweet potato fries because I've become a fan of them recently. I wasn't particularly impressed with those either. They add a lot of sugar and cinnamon to them, which makes a weird taste, in my opinion. I'm not a huge super sweet person, and the place I've had them before didn't put extra stuff on them.   All and all, if you are in the area and need something to eat relatively quickly, consider this place. It's cheap-ish, fast, and pretty good, but it's not a place I'd travel from my native Hendersonville (haha) to go eat at."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to I Love Burgers on May 10th 2014. It was the first place we ate at in Vegas after we checked into the Venetian. I wasn't disappointed. We started with the \"World's Greatest Fried Pickles\". They lived up to the name. They were expertly seasoned spears fried to perfection. I've had fried pickles at a ton of restaurants and at The State Fair of Texas, but I can honestly say these were the best I've had. Next we had Blueberry and Caramel Corn shakes. The blueberry was ok, but the Caramel Corn was out of this world amazing! The burgers we ordered were the Waygu Kobe and the I Love Bacon. The Wagyu Kobe is the most expensive item on the Menu at $25. The Wagyu Beef was worth the hype, but the burger overall was just good, not amazing. The prosciutto was good, but not the best and the truffle cheese did provide a nice flavor. The I Love Bacon was good as well, but it didn't floor me. The idea of a patty made from ground brisket and bacon was a nice touch, though. I'm somebody that has a money is no object for good food on a vacation kind of person, but I did feel $75 was a bit much for two people eating burgers and for what I got. The atmosphere and the service were beyond amazing and will be the main thing that brings us back along with the caramel corn shake and pickles."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here and I just had to review it again. The staff was very pleasant and the food didnt take long but it definately was better the first time we were here ( see my other review). No one was especially happy with their food. I had the longhorn again and this time I'm not sure but I don't think they could have served a flatter chicken breast. Everything was greasier than the first time too. The prices were still high though.   I hope they can change a few things and get it back to where it was the first time we came here."}
{"text":"Fancy burger place in a fancy hotel.  Nothing special.  Very pricy."}
{"text":"We recently had lunch here trying the fried pickles, burgers and shared/sampled various shakes.  The food overall is average with the Oreo shake being the standout of all the things we tried.  The service was good as the guy working the dining room was engaging and helpful.  I like IN N Out, Five Guys and Bachi Burger better but this is close to my work so I will be back."}
{"text":"We went here twice a couple of years ago when we were staying at the Palazzo and I fell in love with the Oregon Trail burger, at the time it was my 2nd best burger ever. We went back a few days later to have another one. We've been raving about it and once we got back to Vegas this year we made a point to go back. What a disappointment! Dry, smaller, overlooked burger with no condiments, just lots of onions and soggy lettuce. Paying over $50 for 2 burgers, fries and a side salad is way too much when the food is less than mediocre. We won't be going back next time we're in town, that's for sure."}
{"text":"So I checked out the yelp reviews on this place before the wife and baby and I went. I expected it to not be super awesome but burgers are my absolute favorite so I def. wanted to give it a try.   First bummer is the host/ order taker person wasn't very friendly and was kind of rude. She asked to see my ID with my bank of America check card (which has my picture on it) and I told her the purpose of having your picture on it is so you don't need to show your ID with a $18 purchase. She has apparently has spoken with the credit card companies about this issue... Really? Im going to steal a credit and take my wife and new born baby to iloveburgers and buy 2 burgers and split 1 order of fries because HECK i don't want to spend too much with some one else's credit card. Ok whatever. On to the food.   I read one review on here saying they thought i love burgers literally went to Costco and bought the big huge packs of frozen burgers and just served those up. HE WAS TOTALLY RIGHT ON. The quality seemed a lot like the Disneyland tomorrowland terrace burgers. Which are the same price except your not in Disneyland.  Definitely doesn't touch SMASHBURGER.   Go to Smash buger if your looking for better quality, lower prices  and a more unique experience."}
{"text":"This place can't possibly love burgers!  On a short trip to Vegas while staying in the Plazzo we decided to have dinner at I Love Burgers.  We were greeted, seated, asked what we wanted to drink, cokes delivered, then order taken, everything was normal at that point.  While we sat and talked time slipped by and 30-40 minutes went by without anyone checking on us.    Our waitress came to the table and told us that our order had been lost by the system; we were finally brought our Mac and Cheese Fries after another 10 minutes all the while sucking the tail end of a coke.    When our burgers were delivered they were dry, dry to the bone, tasteless poor excuses for a hamburger, not to mention a 16 dollar hamburger not including fries.  When the waitress came by and asked us how everything was (at that most inopportune time when you have a mouthful of food) my wife said \"Well, the bun is good.\"  The waitress said great and motored on.  I have to say you will find a better burger at 5 guys, or even Red Robin.  Not only we will not be returning on our next trip, but we tell all of our friends about the awful time we had."}
{"text":"Decent place for a Burger. Customer service was excellent, even though they were getting ready to close.  I still had 45 minutes before closing.  Our server was great and funny. Drinks were delicious! Had the heart and Seoul Burger which came with a fried egg and kimchi.  Weird combo but it works and its so ooey gooey and messy.  Need to come back and try the milkshake spiked."}
{"text":"Had the loco moco breakfast... it was extremely dry, I have no idea why they serve an item that don't they taste test. The burger from here should be the best part but if was far from enjoyable. Please discontinue from the menu unless you can fix this problem.   Reason for 2 stars is the waitress was extremely attentive while I enjoyed watching a game at the bar during Football Sunday"}
{"text":"The burgers are ok, but the place in Mandalay Bay is way better!  Plus, they wouldn't let me make any substitutions and then got part of my order wrong.  And once our food arrived, our waiter was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"I Love Burgers is a great little place in the Palazzo shops.  As a burger fan in Los Angeles I was happy to find out there was a burger joint in the Palazzo where we were staying.  so my sister and her friend decided to join me to try this place out.  The restaurant itself is modern looking and has a full bar.  It does feel like a restaurant in a shopping center, but with a little more class.  The staff is very friendly from the greeter to the table servers.  No problems with customer service here.  The sides were great.  I love the Mac & Cheese Nom Noms, which are 8 pieces of fried and breaded mac & cheese.  The jalapeno cheese dipping sauce made them much more enjoyable.  The parmesan fries were awesome as well.  I opted for the BBQ burger, which has a quality beef patty, onion rings, bacon and lettuce/tomato.  The addition of the lettuce and tomato was a pleasant addition, as most BBQ bacon burgers usually do not have the these.  The burger was juicy, flavorful and was of great quality.  I enjoyed every bite.  I Love Burgers was an excellent overall experience.  They are a great example of delivering quality food with quality customer service.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5 stars   Coming in, I don't know what I was expecting because I've never heard of this place and I'm not from the area. But then again, what should I expect from a fast food joint?  I was coming in for lunch with a friend and we both ordered the I Love Bacon Burger because it was their \"signature\" burger. If they had a signature burger, I was honestly expecting better! When you order a drink/combo, you go up to the soda machine and grab your own drink. You grab your own table. You put your number on a condiment stand and wait for your order to be served.   For the quality of the food, it's not worth the price.  When I first saw it, I was excited! It looked so delicious! It even looked fancy with the imprint \"I Love Burgers\" on the top bun!! The only place I've seen with an imprint on the buns is Unami Burgers. After a few snapshots of this beauty, I didn't expect the taste I had in my mouth - or the grease for that matter. I took my first bite and grease immediately squirted out from below my burger. As I continued to feast on this, oil/grease was dripping down from below my burger and my hand became messy. The burger tasted okay but it felt more cooked than it should be and it didn't really have a taste to it. The best part of the burger was the bacon and that's all I wanted. Bacon. :( The order also consists of fries and if I remember correctly, you have 3 options: reg fries, truffle fries, and I think sweet potato fries.   I wouldn't come back if I came to Vegas again, but don't have high expectations for this place if you do plan on coming here."}
{"text":"Meh. Due to sheer hunger after a long flight, and convenience because I was staying at the Palazzo, this was the first casual eatery I spotted. For $14, I got the \"dante\" an angus burger topped with blue cheese, caramelized onions, roasted garlic aioli on top of a brioche bun. Yes, the burger was big but it tasted super bland. Shocking since the toppings I chose aren't exactly subtle. Everything was missing some good seasoning. Even the bun sucked and I love brioche buns. The burger meat was juicy but had no flavour.   Service was friendly and efficient. The decor has this cute diner feel to it. But I was super disappointed that a place with burgers in the title would produce such a boring and bland product."}
{"text":"We ordered the black bean burger and the truffle fries.  Super tasty and amazing.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am really surprised about all of the bad reviews of this place.  I recently dined here for lunch with out of town friends during Restaurant Week.  The RW lunch menu was $20.12 per person, for 3 courses.  I went to their website beforehand and it appeared as if this was a decent deal - if you ordered the most expensive of each option, it would equal about $20, and the restaurant was donating $5 from each meal to charity. So they weren't really trying to make a ton of money off of this.  When we entered, there was a bit of a line.  Which was fine, because it gave us time to look over the menu and decide what to order.  The RW menu consisted of:  Nom Nom's - These were really delicious! When they brought out my order, I thought it was for the 3 of us to share - but they weren't! My friends orders came out shortly after and I ended up taking a ton home.  For those that don't know - these are fried mac n cheese bites.  We decided we thought that they would be better if they had bacon inside.  I really liked the spicy nacho cheese dipping sauce on the side as well.  Choice of any burger with regular cut fries or sweet potato fries + a soda: - I had the inferno burger.  I really liked it, because I am basically obsessed with jalapenos, but I didn't find it to be really HOT.  It also wasn't small, so even if I had purchased it individually, I wouldn't have been disappointed.  My only gripe was that the burger was super greasy, but that's not a huge deal.  The bun was really good and I like that they char \"I Love Burgers\" in to it.  I got the regular cut fries, which were only OK.  Nothing bad, but also they didn't wow me.  The addition of the soda was a bit overkill, because of the last course....  Any Shake: - Their shakes are AMAZING!  I ordered the oreo shake and my friends each had the coffee shake.  Both were very delicious.  We had SO much food that it was really hard to fully enjoy it, but I managed! The bartender who made our shakes also told us that they could add alcohol if we wanted (we declined).  Good to know!  They serve the extra shake in the metal container on the side, and I was nowhere near finishing mine!  We sat at the bar, which is kind of small, but cute.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.  They have a special on Sundays - BOGO mimosas or bloody marys.  And everyday their I 3 Burgers beer is only $2.  That's what we ordered, and it was what you'd expect for $2 (sorry, I'm a beer snob).  The place seemed pretty busy, but the manager stopped by to ask us how everything was and if we had any suggestions on how to improve the experience.  I thought that was really nice, and it shows that they are dedicated to improving on past complaints (of which we had none)."}
{"text":"It was delicious! Friends talked about, finally went with my daughter, and enjoyed it. Not many options, but burgers is what they do!"}
{"text":"This review is going to cover both of my experiences at 'I Love Burgers'.  The first time was in January 2012. I am a bit of a burger fanatic, so when my buddy and I saw this restaurant while walking through the Palazzo, we had to stop and try it. My first impression was that the dining area is too sterile and it was packed! But the true question was how are the burgers? They did not disappoint. We ordered the Fried Mac & Cheese Noms to start. They are VERY small, but the flavor was fantastic. On to the burgers! We ordered three so we could cut them in half and try a variety. Caprese Burger, Wagyu Kobe Burger, and the Oregon Trail Burger. As well as Sweet Potato Fries. The Caprese Burger was cooked perfectly, as were all the patties, however the balsamic reduction was a bit much. There was quite a bit on the burger and feel a little less would have added to it. Sometimes less is more. That was the case here. 2 star burger. The Wagyu Kobe burger was good.... But not $25 good. The patty was juicy and flavorful but it didn't make my eyes roll back in my head like Kobe Beef should. The Truffle Cheese was a fantastic addition, after all, Truffle cheese is amazing all on it's own! I didn't care for the pretzel bun at all. 3 star burger. The Oregon Trail burger was great! I make Bison Burgers on average of once a week at home. For those that haven't tried Bison, you are doing yourself an injustice. Bison is lower in Fat, lower in Cholesterol, Higher in Protein and in Minerals. Has an amazing sweet taste, and is so JUICY!!!!  Back to the burger.... We ordered it with caramelized  onions to soften them up and take the edge off a bit. The result was a spectacular burger. Juicy, perfectly cooked, flavorful, with a perfect amount of roasted garlic aioli. The Wheat bun was firm enough to hold the burger together, yet not so dense that it took away from the tender patty. 4+ star burger. Sweet Potato Fries were great. Dusted with the perfect amount of cinnamon and brown sugar.  So, over all, the first visit deserved 3 1/2 stars. Being there are no half stars on yelp, let's call is 4 stars, as it was better than 'A-Ok'.  The second visit was last week. This time I knew what I wanted. I walked in around 5:30 pm. The place was DEAD! And it remained dead for the hour and a half that I was there. I sat down, placed my order of Mac & Cheese Noms, an Oregon Trail Burger with Caramelized Onions cooked medium rare, and Sweet Potato Fries. The Noms came out pretty quick. They were as good as I remembered. Still a bit small, but, good nonetheless. Then came the fries and burger. Fries were luke warm at best. Some were even a bit soggy. It was bad. Just bad. However, the burger was worse. My previous experience of a perfectly cooked Medium-Rare burger was a memory. What I received was what appeared to be a juicy Buffalo Patty, but in reality was a dry piece of shoe leather. After my first bite, I cut into the burger to view a grey DRY overcooked $18 burger that my dog would have rejected. I squeezed the patty and not one drop of any type of liquid could be found. This was a first degree burger felony!  For the remainder of my stay at the Venetian, I stayed clear of 'I Love Burgers'. Granted this could be an isolated incident. But it was so bad that it wasn't worth taking the chance. This visit was not only zero stars, but, I would go so far as to give it multiple negative stars. The WORST burger I have EVER had. And I've had some pretty bad ones. Because of the good first experience, I have given it 2 stars. Otherwise it would be one star. I don't think I will ever give it a third shot."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love burgers!!  Wish one of these was in Denver. My waistline is happy there isn't one though.  It's one of those burger places that flirts with being a restaurant a bit too much, meaning the prices are high. But the food is damn tasty."}
{"text":"Great burgers I had the Buffalo burger which was moist not dry at all and the fries are worth getting. It's pricey here and the setting is similar to five guys, smash burgers, or fuddruckers."}
{"text":"I am disappointed with this place. From how difficult it was to find its location in the Grand Canal Shoppes, to how long we waited for our food, and to how the food tasted. As a guest staying at the Palazzo, my friend and I wanted a quick dinner before our night out (aka needed greasy food to absorb alcohol). We saw an ad for this place in the elevator and it seemed like it would fit the bill.  We sat at the bar to order our food to go and I had sticker shock to see the average price of a burger for $16. Really?? Burgers are great and all but I don't think the size and quality (solely judging on pictures from Yelp at this point) justified it. However, we were pressed for time so we ordered a Dante and BBQ burger -- both cooked medium rare and with avocado.  We waited for a really long time and after a short walk back to our room, I discovered that our food was cold and overcooked. I expect a burger place to know how to cook a patty to medium rare and I was torn to see no pink in the patty.  Also, I think they forgot about us which is why the food was cold. I REALLY love burgers and this has been the most disappointing burger I've had... Possibly ever. At least they didn't forget about the avocado. The BBQ sauce and avocado were probably the best parts.   I feel like I was cheated out of a meal and it cost way too much. I'm pretty serious about enjoying my food -- some people talk about you have a finite mount of breaths you can take, I see life with only a limited amount of meals you'll have. I would've preferred eating food from In-N-Out than here. The three-star rating on Yelp for this place is generous.  If you need a quick meal (or any meal) while at the Palazzo, I'd suggest skipping this place and going to Grand Lux Cafe. At least it's consistent, even if it's a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Amazing!! Amazing!! Enjoyed the bacon sliders with a quail egg. Holy canoli were these delicious. Seriously, my favorite burger ever. They were moist, messy, juicy, and will be consumed again."}
{"text":"I LOVE burgers, but I don't love \"I Love Burgers.\" I came here a couple years ago for my birthday dinner because it sounded right up my alley! So sad... The burger was dry and the bun was NOT soft and squishy. I would head over to SmashBurger on the Eastside if you are looking for a tasty bite!  Good beers though.... I guess"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place tremendously! Besides the food being good, the service was what makes it. The Host was great at answering our questions and the waitress/bartender was hilarious! Oftentimes you get waitresses who just humor our questions and don't respond back in a friendly way, but our waitress joined us in our shenanigans but was respectful at the same time. Unfortunately, I didn't collect the receipt to get her name, but she was great! She also split our burgers without us asking her too--and this is a big deal because we weren't sure how we were going to split our shared portion of burgers and fries.   We ordered a coffee shake and it was just the way a shake would taste. We ordered a Love and Seoul burger--which came with kimchi and a sunny side up egg. It was great--a burger with the spiciness of an Asian touch. It wasn't greasy as I know some people have described the burgers as \"drive-in\". It was good! We ordered the garbage fries and I think what made this side dish was the fresh sliced jalapenos on the top. It wasn't as spicy as you would think, but it helped cut through the fattiness of the whole meal--meat, cheese, and fries. I would definitely come back in again!"}
{"text":"Pricey for a burger, if you ask me, but otherwise fine. I stopped in after my original lunch plan turned out to be open for dinner only. This was way different, but a burger sounded good. I like to bracket my week of seafood with beef. I ordered the caprese burger, with fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, and balsamic reduction. Really pretty good. The combo of the basil and the balsamic was very good with the beef. The cheese always gets lost, as it's a little bit more delicate than the burger tends to be, but it was there, and that's good, I guess. I also got the sweet potato fries, which they were kind enough to ask, cinnamon and sugar or salt. Salt please - I don't need them sickly sweet. Of particular note those, this place doesn't exactly use 97/3 lean beef. More like 70/30. Wow.  All in all, satisfying. Their menu is a little small - I guess for a place with a name like this, I was expecting a laundry list of options, when there are in reality only about 8-10, and some of those are fish/turkey, and not really \"burgers,\" if you ask me. Price was high for a burger, but it's Vegas, as I've said a million times this week. Who knows if I'll ever be back, but I wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken sandwich.  There wasn't much chicken at all.  They put it on a giant piece of grilled butter white bread.  The menu doesn't say it's grilled or has butter.  The chicken had nice flavor, but again, there wasn't much of it.  We also ordered a original and it was average and small for the price.  Fries were average.  The kids had a hot dog, it was huge and they loved it.  They also loved the sweet potato fries and tater tots.  Everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"My best friend decided to eat here, and I'm so glad she did! Any place with an appetizer on the menu called \"Nom Noms\" is a winner in my world! Because of the name I thought there would be a lot more burgers I would never eat on their menu, but there wasn't. Perfect for me since I like just regular ol' cheeseburgers, and mushroom burgers are about as adventurous as I get when ordering a burger. However after looking at the menu the \"Inferno Burger\" sounded tasty. It came with fresh jalapeños, jalapeño mayo, and pepperjack cheese. I love spicy food so I wasn't scared of the different types of spice it had. I got it with sweet cut fries with brown sugar and pepper. I also ordered the best thing on the menu, \"Nom Noms\" which is their fried macaroni and cheese appetizer. My bet friend ordered the same thing, only instead of fries se got tator tots. (not sure how I feel about that.) I had absolutely no complaints about my food, and wish there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"all natural grass-fed burgers for under $11?  how am i just now hearing about this place??  try the \"heart and seoul\" if you're in the mood for something uniquely spicy.  sriracha & soy marinated patty with wasabi mayo...mmm. they also have a relatively healthy buffalo burger called the \"oregon trail\".  crazy long happy hour from 2-6 everyday.  try and go during the weekend happy hour when aaron is there.  legit bartender, and $4 mixed drinks!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the reason one of my friends works here at the bar. The reason why I give this place two stars is not because burgers to myself *personally* are redundant, but the fries were very soggy and the food was overly greasy. Ordering The Longhorn (which I thought was *slightly* a better alternative for meat than just a burger), the chicken itself was too greasy for my liking. The fries were too soggy because so much grease was put into making them, or maybe the prep in the back doesn't know how to make fries correctly?  For a burger venue, they have a wide bar and were distinctive drinks on their menu that really weren't that bad. The drinks and the different creative styles they were mixed in were fairly noteworthy for a burger restaurant. Also, your food comes out in less than 10 minutes; I have to say the service here is on top of it, as even observing to-go orders, they waited less than 10 minutes to receive what they needed.  For the drink and full bar, and the speed of the service I would have gave it three stars, but the food at best is two stars. This is one of those burger restaurants to where if you're super drunk or hungover on The Strip, the greasiness would be the perfect place here to soak it all up."}
{"text":"Good food and staff. They have a great happy hour. $1 beers from 2-4 everyday. This is a must go to. Keep up the great food and service."}
{"text":"Great Burger Place. One of the Best in meat quality as well all ingredients. They have some crazy burgers some are good some are not. But if you stick with the basics it's a 5 Star Burger"}
{"text":"I had the Inferno. Incredible burger.  I love burgers. Let's get that out of the way because everyone else does a pun of sorts with this restaurant's name.  Apparently everyone had a terrible experience with this place except for me. I will admit that the price is a bit out of touch with reality - $6 for a 5 ounce burger is overpriced, to say the least. On the strip or in an amusement park, I would understand, but this place is overpriced for its value.  That being said, whether you put it in the category of Fast food or not: (Fuddrucker's, In-N-Out, 5 Guys, Smashburger, etc.) I will say this burger is incredible and contends as the champion of them all.  Their $6 Orange Delight shake was also overpriced, but it was \"Pulp Fiction\" good and I was wow'd to the core. I might return for the shake alone.   The service was very above par.  Short story: You get what you pay for, but in quality, not quantity."}
{"text":"Amazing Delicious Fried Pickles, Inferno Burger off the charts,Vanilla Bean Shake down right yummy.   The Waitress Krys is as great as they come!.   Will be back!.   Yummy yummy."}
{"text":"Talk about over-ordering for the sake of a more robust Yelp review!  Here Diane and I enjoyed a really tasty and complete lunch that for me consisted of an excellent thick medium-rare burger with very flavorful bacon and mushrooms added; a large portion of fine hand-cut fries; a heaping order of Tater Tots; nice light, hot, and thin Fried Pickle slices with Ranch Dressing; and an unanticipated THIRTEEN superior battered Onion Rings, all fresh and smoking hot, served with a memorable Remoulade Dressing.  I knew I would receive some Onion Rings in an O-ring order, but the possibility of receiving twelve large ones was never remotely anticipated.  Fortunately this was the last day of a conference, so 3/4 of the rings; half of the fries; and many Tater Tots were able to be carted home to accompany a sandwich for another lunch the next day.    Diane's burger was medium well rather than medium rare as ordered, and the added Cheese Sauce represented by our server to be mild had an unintended kick to it.  She does not like anything hot or peppery!  The manager came over, tested the creamy cheese, and verified its taste as being spicier than what it should be.  He said that he would be having a talk with the kitchen staff about this.  A new burger was offered but Diane declined in the interest of time.  She did enjoy her Chocolate Milk Shake, however.     Service was friendly and efficient except for the glitch in the Cheese Sauce.  Apparently our server's representation about it was accurate but the kitchen crew faltered in faithfully executing what should have been a mild rather than spicy embellishment.  The food and service were good enough for us to make a return visit, whether or not we are staying at The Palazzo."}
{"text":"**AN IMPROMPTU UYE AT I LOVE BURGERS**  Following the Elite Yelpy Santa Snack Attack and Town Square Shop Local Crawl CMYE, Misti Y. said she was hungry and was going to I Love Burgers, and asked if any local crawlers would like to join her for what turned out to be an impromptu UYE.  For, six crawlers ultimately did.  Besides myself, they were Anthony M., Diane T., Heather, Kevin P., and Vincent.  I looked forward to my meal, because since Restaurant Week when I just did not have time to fit it in, I wanted to sample I Love Burgers' hamburger at The Palazzo.  Now, here we were instead at a fairly new second location at Town Square.  Employees were very friendly, and seemed pleased to have our group there.  I was initially surprised that the menu was much more varied than just a few burgers, so it took me awhile to order, and I ultimately decided to sample various items.  In the end Misti shared her Fried Pickles, I shared my Nom Noms, and Kevin P. shared his Sweet Potato Fries.  So, we had a nice sampling among us, except for the intriguing milk shakes in several unusual variations.  Maybe next time!  To my further surprise, I was more impressed with the Nom Noms and Ahi Tuna Sliders than the 5-oz. Classic Burger reflected in the restaurant's name.  If I see a food item in a restaurant's name, I just assume that this will be its featured and foremost dish.  Not so this night!  While the burger was good, it was not real juicy.  It was covered by a fresh tomato slice and nicely melted cheese which I liked, but also a leaf of dark green lettuce which was fresh but not crisp.  And, I prefer my lettuce crisp.  I very much liked the soft bun on which the burgers are served.  And, as I suspected, 5 ounces of meat were plenty; the 7-ounce patties should be reserved for the most serious carnivores, or those just focusing on a single burger--not someone like me adding three sliders and Nom Noms.  I had ordered my burger medium-rare, as did Diane rather vociferously, and we were told that the burgers would be prepared medium-rare.  While mine was cooked a little beyond that mark it was close to medium-rare, so I have no complaint about that.  But by its appearance I could tell that Diane's burger was plainly cooked medium-well to well done.  And poor Vincent never got his ordered hamburger at all until we were about ready to leave.  The kitchen had somehow forgotten to make it!  Not a good sign!  I found the French Fries to be crispy and very good tasting.  I also liked the one Sweet Potato Fry I tried.  And, while Fried Pickle slices were rather thin, they were good and tasty, too.    The ahi tuna in the sliders was fresh, cool, and rare, just like they should be, with quite spicy slaw but cool avocado slices and carrot shavings to offset its hotness.  Buns were soft and pliable.  And, the Nom Noms were great!  I would come back just for them!  These large bites of fried mac 'n cheese were so cheesy and rich that I only ate two of six, and gladly gave the remainder to my dining companions to see for themselves what I was raving about.  The Nom Noms had been deep-fried, and when bitten into exuded gooey melted cheese just waiting to be released.  These heavenly bites could also be dipped in an accompanying cheese sauce for even more cheesy goodness.  Ordinarily, I rate a restaurant based on just what I encounter, based on my tasting of food items, and my own overall experience.  Rather than relate what dining companions would like me to add to my own observations, I generally advise them to write their own reviews based on their own dining experience if they feel strongly about something that occurred to them.  So, here, based on my total experience alone, I was ready to award 4 stars.  But I don't feel that I can ignore Diane's overdone burger or Vincent's missing burger, which I saw with my own eyes.  They were part of my observations, too.  Thus, I regard this as a 3-star overall dining experience.    And, while I would rate many other places that are known for their hamburgers higher for that single food category alone, this is not just a hamburger joint.  And, that should be kept in mind by diners who like a greater diversity of offerings in one location, including salads and chicken as well.  Or by eclectic diners like me who like to mix things up in the same meal.  So I think I Love Burgers has promise.  And, I will probably return."}
{"text":"We popped in here while waiting our time for the gondolas.  We hit their happy hour which is key in Vegas.  They had the best beer batter fried pickles I've ever had!! Their mozzarella sticks where like slices of bread they were so big. They also were great and gave a to go cup for our beers."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Interesting Americana culture menu choices,  up to date selections,  good quality ingredients,  fast service, fun environment all enhanced by the excellent,  friendly service of Micah!   I'm coming back for breakfast tomm."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a solid 3 stars ...  Good burgers (mine was the standard with a fried egg and caramelized onions), good topping choices, good bread and good french fries (1 order is big enough to share).  You betcha."}
{"text":"Ouch! Not sure I understand the negative reviews.   We came here for breakfast before a shopping excursion at Barneys. I ordered the Loco Moco and my husband the breakfast burrito.   The food was delicious..and came in large portions. The prices were extremely reasonable compared to any of the casino joints.   The service was thorough and friendly!"}
{"text":"We got The Dante burger - grilled onion, aioli and Gouda. The BBQ burger. Garlic fries and a drink - total cost ? $26!!!! I'm going to give them 3 stars bc anywhere that has sprouts is ok with me! The  burgers are tasty and the quality of meat is 3 1/2 out of 5. The toppings are fresh and choices endless (this is the reason I'm giving them 3 stars) The reason they aren't getting 4 or 5 stars is that I feel as though they are a little pricey for the fast food atmosphere of the place. Not to mention I've had better garlic fries at less qualified places.... (while watching a giants game in San Fran) with that said though......... Will I go back? Of course.... They have too many reasons for me not to... Ahi tuna sliders, black bean burgers, caprese burger..... Will I be sharing fries and a drink each time.... Maybe!  ***update: went back for a caprese. I stand firm in that three. They aren't terrible but really are not that great for the price."}
{"text":"Hi.  I'm the girl that went to a burger joint and ordered a salad.  With that said - the salad options were quite exciting and I was glad to see that I wasn't limited to a paltry wad of iceberg, rotting tomatoes, and bagged cheese.  Instead, I got a mountain of fresh green lettuce, avocado, and plenty of other tasty salad fixin's.  I asked for the tuna addition and was a little disappointed at how overcooked the tuna pieces were - but they were still flavorful.  Just a bit dry.  Service was good.  Friendly.  Relatively quick.  I loved all the tv's readily available for sports watching and spouse ignoring.  Next time I am in Vegas - I'll keep I Love Burgers in mind if I'm hankering for healthy.  I'd also like to give a few of their tasty burger options a try... the menu sounded delicious and there were plenty of flavorful fancy options."}
{"text":"Stopped in & gave this place a try for dinner last night & I'm happy we did. I had the I  Bacon burger & it was delicious. Our waitress (Dee Dee) was awesome & super sweet. She was so nice to my kids very catering to them as well. I would highly recommend eating here & make sure u ask for Dee Dee...she only works night shifts though."}
{"text":"I love I love burgers.  Not because I love burgers, but because I love great atmosphere, service and good company.  Nothing compliments a meal like those attributes.  Really tho, how can you screw up an American staple? So my unit of measure would be the service of this place.  Coming here, I didn't expect the attention I did.  We were promptly seated with a warm greeting, tables were so spotless, you could eat off of them, duh.  However what was most memorable about I love burgers at the palazzo, is our waitress Jenny, by way of Minnesota.  She was charming, social, and assertive.  It's like we had a telepathic connection.  She knew when to fill my water glass, provide me more napkins, check up in me from time to time, jeez she might as well have wiped the ketchup from my lips! Highly recommend i love burgers at the palazzo, whether you're a seasoned burger veteran, or just becoming acclimated to a burger joint with 5 star quality service! Don't forget to ask for Jenny.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Came in the first time about a month ago and the patio was open letting all the hot air inside.  It was a  100 outside and was about the same inside.  I came into the restaurant to get out of the heat and eat!  Left for an air conditioned place.      2nd time  Ordered a burger to go  w just mustard and onions,nothing else,for an elderly aunt.  Took it to her,opened bag and surprise,it came with lettuce ,tomato and relish.   After I specifically said M & O only and verified it again with order taker!  Fries were soggy and inedible,all this cost me about $12 bucks.    This place bites!  Bring back the pizza place!"}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite meal I had in Vegas! With a super bright, fun, bubbly decor and a logo that I fell in love with, I had to stop in! The burgers were huge, and the parmesan fries were incredible, and the fried pickles were some of the best I have ever had! Though it is a bit pricey, it is in the Palazzo on the Strip, so it's kind of understandable. The service was attentive and friendly, which I realized is pretty rare on the Strip! Next time I am in Vegas, I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"It was just okay.  Lot of $$ for an okay burger and fries.  The best part about this place is they have a chalk board room where the kids can color while waiting for their food."}
{"text":"Let me spell this out for you H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E I've made burgers and fries at home better than this. They couldn't even get the num nums right. I could taste powdery cheese throughout the entire appetizer. Not sure if it's just Buffalo, but my burger was entirely dry and hard to stomach, asked for extra garlic Aioli sauce just to swallow it. The menu claims they cook all burgers medium with a pink center unless otherwise requested, mine was well ALL the way through. Fries were boring and none of the cheese actually stuck to my fries because they used powdered Parmesan. At least melt some butter or something to make it stick to the fries. SERVICE: again H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E I've been serviced at the gynecologist with more pleasant results! There was maybe 6 groups of people in the establishment when i sat down, 2 main servers and several runners and bussers. It took forever to get someone to actually come get our drink orders. We knew what we wanted before they had ever even greeted us at our table. Waited forever for the check to arrive, and when it did....woah!!! Spent $80 on dinner for 2 with only 1 beer each, at an actual fancy and nice establishment i'd be willing to pay that, but not for this crap!   NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Dry&cold. Doesn't get any worse then that. Fry's were hot but definitely  not fresh."}
{"text":"We come to this place every time we're in Vegas  which is usually once a year or more. The experience has always been good. However on this trip the server was in a rushy mood and was rude. He didn't even take our drink orders and goes are y'all ready to order. He cut me off before I could even finish ordering my meal.  Besides the bad service, the burgers were great!! We all got the Loco Moco, which is a burger topped topped with steam rice, egg, gravy and a side of kimchi. I'm giving it 3 stars because of the lack of service."}
{"text":"We  were last day in Vegas and decide to try out this palce before we going to go to airport. Food was really good....... staff was nice .... fries were not great everything esle was ok water was from the tab.........burger was really good."}
{"text":"I got the I love bacon burger and it was really good and the location was convenient. But I gave it three stars cause it was nice in there but freezing and hard to enjoy my meal . Also fries were extra and did not come with your hamburger. Honestly though it was better then Guy Fieri's burger ."}
{"text":"Too long dont read, great place great service  Let me say I LOVE burgers. So this sounded like just the place for me. I'm a pretty big stickler about service. If I'm going to pay something I want to get what I want. When I walked in the guy that took my order was really cool and was able to answer my questions. The only set back is that the item that I wanted was out of order, which is always a negative.  The food arrived promptly and for 35 bucks for a kids meal consisting of a hot dog and fries, our 2 burgers drinks and fries it wasn't bad at all. They have normal burgers and more fancy ones which was cool to try and they have an awesome happy hour with beers from 2-4 and 8 to close daily. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I was very reluctant to try this burger place. It is extremely different. A little tasty but definitely not worth the money. This location is VERY expensive for a burger. The hotdog was better. They have great French fries though. Just be sure to see if there is a coupon somewhere before you sit down and order.   Breakfast is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I had previously been to I Love Burgers once, and thought that it was pretty good.  A co-worker suggested that we go back for lunch, so we tried it, and when we got there and we were told they had recently updated the menu, which previously had some great options, I have to admit that we were very underwhelmed.  Nothing to special, but not an awful experience either, but I must say.... there are better burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with my family the other day. We sampled a few burgers - all were great, we had the Nom Noms - excellent. A real highlight is the fried pickles - WORLDCLASS! The restaurant was clean, there are chalkboards all over the walls, my kids loved writing on them. I didn't have any beer, but the selection looked great and I will get over there again to enjoy some - I did notice some Happy Hour specials too - that's a good thing! Check it out, my family loves burgers and we love them here too!"}
{"text":"The decor is minimalist and somewhat 70s plastic molded with astroturf on the wall. Not sure what that's all about but it gave me the urge to go to the golf range and practice my drive. Rudy, the server, took care of us and did a great job. The food is good but not great. I make better burgers at home. Service was excellent as were the margaritas. It's pricey for what ends up on the plate.   The Nom Noms at I Love Burgers were an interesting, cubical, and strange way to have mac and cheese, breaded and fried. It was good but definitely ask for extra beef demi glacé to drizzle on them, so much better.   The Wagyu Kobe burger was $25 for just the burger and it was good. But I expected more from a $25 dollar burger. Again, make sure you ask for more demi glacé to soak the bun in extra flavor.   We'll give it another try soon. Maybe the buffalo burger, steak burger, or breakfast burger might make the cost/taste cut. Definitely stop by for a margarita or Bloody Mary, they're good!"}
{"text":"$400 for our meal... I should have gambled the money, it would have been better spent or drank myself into oblivion. Honestly save ur $$$ grab a burger at IN N OUT. So much better. Shakes too. We had the Waygy or Kobe some ultra expensive meat and all my friends were just so excited. No FLAVOR! SLOW ASS SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"After shopping at the Coach store nearby, my husband and I saw I love burgers around the corner and decided to eat dinner here. Unfortunately, I did not love their burger.  This is what we ordered:  -Mac and Cheese Nom Noms: Tasty fried Mac and Cheese squares with a side of cheese sauce. They were very good and probably the best part of our meal!  -Sweet Potato Fries: nothing special about these, some were not cooked well. I have definitely had better elsewhere.   -The Standard Burger with Cheddar Cheese: it honestly looked pretty boring when it arrived at our table. Sadly, the beef patty was not juicy or  hot and tasted pretty bland.   -I love Bacon Burger: my husband ordered this. He pretty much felt the same way I did. The burger was not great, and what a shame since it was called I love bacon!   The two good things about this place:  -Friendly wait staff who checked up on us often.   -Very fast service! We were just starting on our Mac and Cheese appetizer, then 2 minutes later, our burgers arrived!  Well, I'm glad I got to try this place but will not be returning. Our bill was about $60, which is pretty expensive for burgers and sides. I would not have minded if the food was great, but it was below average and just disappointing."}
{"text":"Actually 3.5 stars, but I'll bump it up due to our wonderful waitress. She recommended a spiked milkshake (Coffee bean) which was WONDERFUL! More about it later:  The standard: Literally a standard burger. Lettuce, tomatoes, cheese. Nothing special. BUT!! The beef patty was moist and you can taste that it was good beef. Not ground crap you buy at supermarkets, but literally fresh ribeye or whatever part of cow it is chopped up into delicious goodness.   Salmon salad: I know, I know...go into a burger place and order a salad? Well, for us gluten-free folks we don't really have a choice. Salad was very blah. I felt like a moo-Cow trying to chew on grass. Salmon was moist and good, but still a very unsatisfying meal.  Coffee bean milkshake (spiked): Spiked with vodka, kahlua, and baileys. Trust me, you cannot taste the alcohol! Comes in a giant cup with extra on the side...I couldn't stop eating it! The bf had to tell me to slow down ;( Little random chunks of ice cream made it all the better...delicious!  Overall, not bad for your average burger, but not gluten-friendly at all. The waitress told me they put bread crumbs in the patty so you can't even order it without the bun. If I could eat the whole burger without suffering from an allergy, I'd come again....but for the salad? No thanks."}
{"text":"The food was really tasty..service was quick n super attentive! Daryl did a great job making sure we were happy!!!!! Give this place  a try sure to satisfy $!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Cool place to grab a burger or a slushie from their drinks menu.They have massive burgers, and they are very flavorful. I had a margarita slushie and they do not go light with the alcohol so you really get your monies worth! The garbage fries are delicious!(yes that might sound gross but thats the name of the dish lol). They are a bit oily, but over all they are really tasty! I think this place is worth trying out.   Sidenote: They have really cool shirts that say \"I Love Beer\" or \"I Love Burgers\", and sadly they didn't have my size otherwise I would have bought one!"}
{"text":"I Love Burgers isn't exceptional by any means, but I do like its portion size and price ratio. I stopped by for breakfast, and shared the sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich and the French toast combo with the mister.   The breakfast sandwich was good--the brioche bun definitely took it up a notch, but the egg seemed artificial to me in its folded-sheet style. The side of hashbrowns was okay.  The French toast combo was enormous, consisting of one dish of four slices of French toast and another dish of eggs, bacon, and more hashbrowns, if I remember correctly. Again, it wasn't exceptional by any means (except maybe size), but it certainly did the job in filling us up for most of the drive back to LA.  Prices aren't bad for the location and convenience, and service was alright."}
{"text":"Gourmet burger lover? Not for you then. Look elsewhere. Nice staff. Weak kitchen. Priced way too high. Not terrible. But not great."}
{"text":"We came here for a work outing recently for lunch. I ordered the classic inferno and we all shared the onion rings, tater tots, natural cut fries and sweet potato fries. The tater tots were probably my favorite of all the side items and the burger was just ok. This place is very similar to Smash Burger. You order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. The burger was pretty good, but I was not a fan of the bun so I ended up just eating the patty.   They have some interesting milkshake options and they seem to have some good happy hour menu items as well as extended hours for happy hour. I probably won't be back, but the food is ok if you are in the area, but there are so many better places to eat at Town Square that I don't see this as being a high priority."}
{"text":"Pretty big restaurant except the seating is a bit tight. The customer service was great. I got the chicken parm sliders. They were good but the breading on the chicken was too thick to where I couldn't taste the chicken. The garlic parmesan were delicious! The selection on the menu was very unique, definitely makes you want to return to try more!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.... The skillet is the best for breakfast. All around great place!"}
{"text":"So disappointing for the price. I would pick the Habit fast food restaurant or even Carls jr over this place. If it wasn't as expensive I would say it's bearable. Trust me you can do better than this place for the money."}
