{"text":"This is one of my and my husband's favourite place to eat, food is always good and fresh and the owner is a lovely man who always is pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"NOW called the \"Grill Cottage\", associated with the tremendous Damas at Lawrence and Vic Park... The BEST falafel comes to Parkdale!! Honestly, BEST falafel in the city!!!"}
{"text":"This is the sizzling grill, the corner food place people know you'll be eating late night when other places' kitchens are closed. Sure this isn't a 5 star shawarma palace, but it's a charming-in-its-own-way hybrid of an american diner with your classic middle eastern menu. It's the neighborhood's little place of reliability, and they know it since they get all sorts of crowds at night. I don't come here for their burgers, even though their deals are attractive. I come here for their cakes (the covered ones), or their shawarma/middle eastern servings, yes, but what else do I come for? Their sodas. Because this is the little corner of paradise for the soda lover that I am here. The sodas are why I keep coming back. Get your fix of Stewart's, Arabic 7up, The Pop Shoppe or any random miscellaneous catchy can/bottle you may find in one of their several fridges at both ends of the shop! Let's hope they keep up the selection and bring us, who knows, Arabic Coke, or maybe Japanese soda?
I'm always much satisfied with a plentiful shawarma plate with fries and a nice soda in a glass bottle.
Like I said, their burgers are bad, its not that they're unsanitary but they're just not quality beef (what did you expect for the price). So take whatever else you'd want along with their crispy hot fries, and a nice glass bottle of Black Cherry or Ginger Beer soda. If ever, some places may even accept you bringing over the food to have a beer in a pub around.
I will say something negative about sanitation though, carefully pick your cake or desert as you don't want it to have a dead fly on/in it. Some things were packed with a dead fly in it, so always be careful. They do have other deserts than cake, like baklava or ice cream, but I haven't tried those yet. I'm being careful, I chose a clean cake once and it was just a fine dessert after a nice plate, and their ice cream may be decent but remains for me to try!
Anyway this is the famous little place of the area, a soda lover's little piece of heaven, and a simple and plentiful selection to the aware consumer! I'm glad there is something like the sizzling grill around here for fun nights with options!"}
{"text":"After almost four years living a few blocks north, I finally tried this place!

Interior is hot, noisy din filled with shouting (friendly, productive shouting) and delicious food! They always have specials and everything is prepared right in front of you. I think they're open nonstop too."}
{"text":"We have been eating here forever, the old owner (Adam I think) was a SUPER sweet guy, and always gave me heaping piles of food, especially through my pregnancy (fun fact, he gave me my last meal while I was in labour and bless him when my husband stopped by to tell him I was having the baby, he gave us piles of food like you wouldn't believe to eat at the hospital). Anyways, prices are really good and the food is always yummy. The management has since changed and we no longer see him there. The food is still great but I find the new menu a little more limited. (Example a plate of shawarma now comes with only rice, potatoes are now extra $$) either way it's still a staple takeout place in our house and the new guys are still really friendly."}
{"text":"For a small diner, the food is surprisingly good!!

My favourites include the chicken shawarma wrap, Greek salad, and fish and chips. They do have daily sandwich specials, however I haven't tried them yet. The owner is always friendly and efficient. 

Most importantly- the food is inexpensive, delicious and the portions generous. I'm so glad I discovered this place- it's easy to pass by it without a second thought. It's my go-to when I don't have the energy to make supper but want a cheap and comforting meal."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to reopen. Its appealed to me all the times my boyfriend and I pass it, walking in his neighborhood. Formerly called the Sizzling Grill. Now called, Cottage Grill. It took me a while to find it on here, even.

 I ordered the falafel and salad combo and upgraded my drink to a smoothie. It was all pretty spectacular.  Except the onions, which I have come to know I really don't like in my wraps, or salads. They use a purple Spanish onion. So, if you're like me and want less of that then remember to tell them. Otherwise it automatically comes with their recipe.  

The avocado smoothie was tasty. It would have been better with a banana and some yogurt. 

My partner ordered  a chicken sandwhich and fries. As is always the case with gfs and their bfs with their fries they order, the lady has to try. These fries... OMGosh are they ever good. Fresh, crisp on the outside with just the right amount of tenderness and softness on the inside. Unlike other places that seriously need to clean their deep fryer. This place is a sea of green in an area of concrete..meaning its definitely worth going to. I'm curious and hopeful it will remain the same, a couple years down the road. Their chicken sandwich also looked really good. 

Cannot wait to try their food, smoothie and yes their $2/$2.50 cheesecake."}
