{"text":"Love this place! My go-to bubble tea shop now when in Mississauga. Highly recommend the bubble gaga  also really like the jasmine milk tea. I usually get my bubble tea with half sugar & it's perfect! The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"Love coco and their teas. I usually go to the one in Richmond hill, but I happen to be close to this location for work for the past few months, and have been almost every other day
Servers are okay, some better than others. When I called in my order last week, the lady was completely unaware of what the 3 guys was - something that is on their best seller and recommended drink menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent bubble tea and service! I love that I have control over the sugar content."}
{"text":"best. bubble. tea. place. eva. highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"First time at CoCo and I was a bit lost... so many flavours! I had the Taro Milk Tea... So good!"}
{"text":"I first tried CoCo tea at their Scarborough location because of a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I did. It was added to my ever-growing list of bbt places to go. When we found out there was a Mississauga location, we had to try it as well. As of today, I've been to 3 different locations and it's safe to say, they are consistent with their bbt across all.

Drinks: I've tried many different options on the menu and haven't had a bad drink yet. I will mention that their drinks are sweeter than others so I lessen my sugar to either 30% or 0% depending on which topping I go for. The Sago has to be one of my favourite toppings and I haven't found it at any other bbt place yet. They soak it in sugar so it's best to get 0% sugar if you're getting it. I'm more of a Jelly and Pudding kind of gal but I can enjoy their tapioca once in a while as well. It's not too soft or too hard. I would compare it to Chatime's tapioca.

The milk tea is a nice balance of tea vs. milk for my taste. You get more of the tea flavour and it isn't overpowered by milk. Their juices and fruit teas are also strong in flavour (in a good way) but I would recommend less sugar or none. 

Interior: This location is pretty small and only has a few tables. It's brightly lit though and very clean (it is new afterall). They can fit maybe 15 people or less so if you're looking to hang out with a large group of friends, take the drinks to someone's house. It's more of a take-out location."}
{"text":"I am an avid Chatime drinker because there's one located right across where I work. But if there were to be a CoCo close to me (Vaughan), I would choose it over Chatime any day. I'm in Mississauga a few times a week and I'll always come to this location to get my bubble tea fix. The service is consistently friendly and their beverage quality is always high. I love how much topping they give! 
Their tapioca is always nice and chewy and has a nice texture to it compared to the other bubble tea places I've been to.
There isn't much to the seating area, but every time I've been here, there are always seats available."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite bubble tea place for sure!

I think I've gotten drinks from here at least, 5 times the past month. And I don't even live near this place but it's worth the travel. The bubble tea are always so refreshing and I like how they let you customize the ice and sugar quantity of the drinks! The servers are always so patient and pleasant. They seem very in tune with their surroundings with all the tapioca and sago that they make and the customers they have to serve. The drinks are just so good! I have to start their rewards program because I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"Tried many drinks from this brand back in Waterloo, and it's comparable to Chatime in my opinion. The promotions are on point however, even with prices for bubble tea going up recently with the wage increase, so one can still enjoy some good ol' bubble tea from time to time without breaking the bank!

The Red Bean Matcha Milk tea is currently on for $3.98, and it's been one of the best bubble tea drinks I've had in a while. Sweetness was just right at regular, and it was flavorful without the strong overpowering matcha taste from other matcha drinks. Will definitely buy this drink in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place. The line up gets long but you always get greeted by happy faces and the bubble tea is worth your while. My go to drink is the Matcha slush with red bean and mango yakult. 

P.s. this place rewards you Vicinity points"}
{"text":"Bubble tea is pretty good but the service is so bad. We went here 4 times and 3 out of 4 they run out of tapioca. One time we line up for almost 30mins and one of the server said there's no more tapioca. Come on... You specialize in bubble tea and your running out of tapioca. You should started making more when you saw the lineup

We also, tried to call in for pick up, but they did no t want to make our order in advance."}
{"text":"Finally a CoCo on the west end of GTA! Mississauga is has really expanded in restaurant and caf√© options of the Asian flair. And another that accepts vicinity! 

As part of their buy one get one free promo (buy 1 drink from their top 10, get a regular milk tea w/ tapioca free), we picked up a regular 3 guys (milk tea + tapioca, grass jelly, pudding) and the regular milk tea. 

Their bbt is super sweeeet! I feel like their less sugar, would be the same as a regular sweet at Chatime. 

Staff was super friendly; greeted us as we walked in, even as they were busy with other orders. They took their time to give us a brief on their menu and current promo. 

Not as much seating compared to Green grotto, Chatime or Bubble Republic - more a grab & go type of place. 

It's not the busiest plaza of Mississauga, but being located a few units down from Emerald, that should help drive business. 

Their promo runs from Dec. 8th to 18th, be sure to check it out! I know I'm definitely making this my Holy grail bbt for now."}
{"text":"Love the quality and freshness of CoCo's bubble tea! My favourites are the Japanese roasted milk tea with tapiocas and Bubble Gaga with tapioca! The sugar to tea ratio is always spot on! Nice place to hang out and great location right in the middle of downtown Sauga. They can up to 18 people. Usually busy in the evenings."}
{"text":"Tasty bubble tea. Their tapioca is done just right :) they have seasonal features which are cool to try out. Friendly staff, good music LOL"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried at CoCo's has been very enjoyable. There's so much variety, there's something for every taste. Don't hesitate if you want to request half sweet for your tea, they make it the way you want it. It's not the cheapest in price ($4-$5, two sizes available) but if you want a treat it's worth it. It's a busy place (Eglinton, Mississauga) location so you know it's good & has a loyal client base."}
{"text":"Great location to rival the more and more expensive Bubble Republic across the street. Though the menu is fairly small..the drinks were alright!

I tried the Lemon King and this was preetty good! Tastes like lemonade..which I think it was..but they give you a full lemon inside? Cool.. 

I'd certainly recommend giving it a shot as more bubble tea joints are opening up around the city..however I still end up at ChaTime but will occassionally come back here when I am bored of my roasted milk tea!

PS. Way better then the pathetic excuse we have called GreenGrotto"}
{"text":"Aaaamazing bubble tea. Great taste too. Not too sweet, just perfect. Super fast service and they have a loyalty card...10 tea's and you get 1 free. Great price too!"}
{"text":"From the three most popular bubble tea places there are in Mississauga: Chatime, Bubble Republic, and CoCo, I must say...

I'M IN LOVE WITH THE CoCo (i got it for the low, low, haha! just kidding)

I've always seen my friends snap pictures of their drinks from here and I've always wondered why. Was it that good? Indeed it is.
When entering, I realized it was really clean so that's a good sign. As for their service it's pretty fast as well. Weekdays they're not usually busy as there are only around 1-2 people ahead of me. I've tried 3 drinks from here so far and they are:

CARAMEL MILK TEA: My absolute favorite. In fact, when I came here today they were apparently sold out of this!! *sobs* If you're a fan of coffee then you'll definitely like this. I don't know why but it doesn't really taste like caramel but more of a mixture of coffee and milk tea but it's a wonderful mix.

2 LADIES: This would be my second choice if there wasn't any caramel milk tea. In this drink, you can definitely taste the milk tea which is great. My only concern with this drink is that the pudding is clumped at the very bottom so to actually get it in the drink, you really need to mix up with your straw. If not, you can just slurp it out piece by piece (which is what I do).

MANGO SMOOTHIE: I was surprised when I first had this because the mango tasted VERY fresh. The beverage wasn't over sweetened and it was just perfect. In any mango beverages you some-what expect chunks of mango but just to let you all know, there isn't any!

The only thing I dislike about the drinks are how much ice they put in each beverage because by the time the ice melts, it'll definitely make your drink water. HOWEVER, you can modify your drink with how much sugar or ice you would like in it. I tend to usually go for Less Ice and 30% Less sugar. In addition I would like to commend this place with regards to their tapioca. Yum yum yum!! Their tapioca is great because it's chewy but not not too tough. 

In the end, if you are ever in dire need of some bubble tea, this is a location you should totally take the time to check out."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a Bubble Tea and found this place after looking on Yelp. There was a pretty line long - I was maybe the 5th person in line, but service was fast. There were two gentlemen out front and a girl working in the back.

I ordered a Roasted Milk Tea with Pearls and 1/2 the sugar. I should have done 75% sugar because I would have liked it sweeter. There was also some sort of fishy taste to the drink .... I assume this is the way it just tastes. It was actually fine.

Front counter was a bit dirty - there was a little basket there for Pick Up and receipt garbage was in there. Wish they had individual wrapped large straws versus a large bag where you would grab a straw.

Grubby dirty hands would be infecting all the straws."}
{"text":"One of the better bbtea shops around. I got to try it a couple of times. Love their pearls, their teas are not diluted like some shops and not overwhelmingly creamy either. I like their 3 guys and their fruity drink selections. I liked the lemon king but because of that ridiculous gigantic fruit they call a lemon thrown into the drink that takes up otherwise one/third of a perfectly good cup....that's just space wasted for potentially more bbtea...I wouldn't order it again because of the value lost. Love the place!!! Will be coming back as long as they as still good and opened"}
{"text":"Come here for the opening special - until dec 18! If you order any top 10 drinks, you can get a free medium milk tea! I ordered the \"3 guys\" and it was delicious - you get milk tea with tapioca, grass jelly and pudding! Also got a hot red bean milk tea and i tasted the red bean! It was recommended to shake the drink for 20-30 seconds to release he full flavour!!!

Only downfall is that they put the hot drink with a cold drink plastic seal, so it was spilling on me as I was walking - there was barely any room in there. Also, the cup was beginning to dissolve around where I was drinking from...

Overall, a 4/5 for the experience and flavour."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The sounds of romantic k-pop and 90's love songs welcomed us right when we walked in. The interior is bright, colourful, and well-lit. The spacing is kind of narrow, and during peak times, it can be a bit difficult to grab a table. But otherwise, service was friendly, ambiance is bright and cheerful, and the bubble tea itself was decent. 

We visited on a Friday night, and it was packed! As of the date of this review, on February 2016, they're currently having a special where you can purchase a Large drink for $3.99 (from a selection of flavours listed on a small 'Specials' board by the cash register). I ordered a hot Tapioca Chocolate. While it was a bit watery (think of diluted hot chocolate), the flavour itself didn't taste as artificial I thought it would be and it wasn't overtly sweet either, which is always a plus for me! Also on the plus side, the tapioca bubbles were delicious and chewy. Decent bubble tea. 

This place is located just a couple doors down from Emerald Chinese Restaurant, which we frequent for dim sum all the time. Will come back to CoCo whenever I'm in the area. 

With tax, my total came to around $4.50."}
{"text":"The thing I like about coco is its simple menu. It'd easy to choose from a wide variety of Bubble tea."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a full 5 star because my drink was bloody amazing.So I went here for the first time normally my go to bubble tea place is Chatime.I ordered the pearl tea with coconut jelly and boy it was delish.

My friend ordered a green tea.She is not a bubble tea kinda girl and she just ordered a green tea, I believe she forgot to mention that she wants it hot and not chilled.

As soon I got my drink I stood behind and my friend, she moved forward to get her tea, she politely tells the staff I'm sorry I didn't mention but can I get a hot green tea instead of the cold and the UNPROFFESSIONAL staff makes the most unpleasant face and tells my friend next time if she doesn't tell them she will be charged.Huh??Was is a threat.

We both walked out of the place not that happy and it was while I was driving home I thought to myself I should have given this rude staff  a peace of mind there and then.But you know it's during  events like these I feel yelp is such an amazing place for writing your heart out.I hope the manager/owner can train their staff better.

Also their bathroom was out of order.No matter how  great your tea is you aren't getting my business if I have to put with this crap."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend after hearing so much about the bubble tea here. The location is quite small and crowded, so it's hard to get seating. The staff are pretty friendly and drinks are made fast. 

I ordered the Matcha Milk Tea, and my boyfriend got the Mango Slush (both with pearls!). They tasted alright, the boba tasted nice. I prefer the Matcha here to Chatime, but the slushes there are much better than CoCo."}
{"text":"As a frequent boba drinker, I'm always down to try new spots. I finally got the chance to try out Coco and I'm already a repeat customer. I remember seeing Coco during my recent trip to Thailand but regret not trying it! My first visit to Coco in Mississauga, I tried the '3 Guys' and it was really good, quality of the tapioca and the amount is just right. Service is also quick not like Bubble Republic and prices are within the typical price range for boba (approx. $5 for a large)."}
{"text":"When I visited CoCo for the first time in China, I was amazed. 1 CAD got me a large milk tea with tapioca, and the tea was amazing! So, when I heard that a CoCo was opening up within 5 minutes from my house, I got really excited.

I didn't know when I first visited CoCo that it was the largest bubble tea chain in the world. I always thought that was Chatime. But I did notice that when I was in China, CoCo was everywhere like Tim Hortons... I should've known.

The first thing I realized at their Canadian location was that their drinks werent $1. #sad #aspexected

They had a top 10, much like every other bubble tea chain. However. I noticed that their top 10 was more diverse than other chains'. They have drinks of the month, just like Chatime. However, instead of having just one item at $3.99, they had a selection of drinks all at $3.99. I tend to make my flavour decisions based on these sales, and as a result I've gotten to try quite a variety of their drinks.

My favourite thus far is the caramel milk tea with tapioca. I've had it both hot and cold and it's been great both times. Their original milk tea is also very good and another item i'd recommend.

The draw to CoCo is that they do everything great. The tea flavour was strong, and the tapioca was firm and chewy but not too hard. These things are key for me, and CoCo is currently my favourite milk tea spot as a result."}
{"text":"We ordered the CoCo milk tea and Bubble tea, regular sugar and regular ice. Service was quick. 

We found the taste and pricing to be on par with Chatime's, which had thus far been my favourite of the bubble tea options in the GTA - so I'll be back again! 

Their Vicinity deal is 1 free drink after 10 drinks, whether eating in or take-out.

P.S. What is it with most people recommending less sugar?! The sweeter, the better in my opinion :)"}
{"text":"Wow so many bubble tea places open now in sauga! I'm in bbt heaven lol.

This place is located right in central sauga, so a lot closer for me to go to. I have to admit I've gone the last 3 days in a row......

They have a grand opening sale until the 18th where you get a free medium pearl milk tea with purchase of any of their top 10 drinks.  

So far I have tried regular milk tea, mango yakult (really yummy!), taro sago milk tea, mixed juice macchiato (passion fruit and mango green tea with milk snowcap), and lemon king.  They were all amazing with no complaints.  I was surprised how chewy and perfect the consistency of the sago was.  I was scared it would be too soft since they are so small.  Will continue to try more.

There is only 3 tables for seating, so definitely more of a take out spot than sit in."}
{"text":"Confessions: This is going to sound pretty bad, but I have their bubble tea at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite place to get bubble tea. I usually go here every weekend with my gf. I like it because not only can you get the regular bubble tea drinks that other places offer (and also, adjust sugar levels and ice levels), but they have creative drinks as well like bubble gaga and 3 guys. My favourite drink is the lemon king with tapioca. They recently added a new drink with grapefruit. Definitely going to try that. 

The only tiny down side is that they slimmed up their bottle size. But aside from that, the drinks are amazing. 

Location is a decent place, near emerald Chinese restaurant, and mama's pizza. 

Evironment is pretty chill too. 

Late at night there's usually a long line up, so best to come earlier to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"Great to see CoCo open up in sauga. Another bbt place to choose from!  Store is not too big and seats are limited.  I would see this location as a grab'n'go kind a place.  This plaza is quite busy with restaurants, businesses, and offices so parking may get difficult at times. The location itself is central Mississauga which is an excellent spot.
During grand opening,  they have a bogo special but their free drink is the regular milk tea with tapioca. As I did not know what to get, my brother got the 3 guys while I got the regular bubbletea. After we got our drinks, my brother pretty much immediately tried the drink. I waited until I got home but he said the tea was  bland. I took a sip and it was definitely not what I would've expected. He said the pudding and grass jelly was okay which is good. In my regular bubble tea I added red bean. I personally thought the bubbles were too chewy and the red bean could have been cooked longer.  I would probably get something else next time and avoid tapioca and red bean.  The milk tea was definitely bland lol. 

There are other drinks so I'm still a fan and besides they just opened so I'll give them another shot!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get your bubble tea fix! Went here on a non rush hour for my first visit so we got to appreciate the place. Its quite narrow inside and there are a few tables available so if your lucky you can get one if there isnt too much traffic . Staff is nice and prompt so thats always good.

I can't even tell you how much I come here now after my first visit. I prefer this place over Ch*t*me. I just like the taste better and so does my hubby. My usual favorite is their Coco milk tea and my hubby would always get the lemon king. 

I highly recommend coming here if your around the area. It's such a nice and cute place despite the place being small especially when they get busy."}
{"text":"My favourite bubble tea place ever. Usually there is parking. Decent price. Friendly service. Washroom is next to checkout and is clean. About 5-6 tables."}
{"text":"So in love with their real taro milktea/ real taro with milk. I dont think you can get this real taro anywhere else. It is currently on promo for $3.80 for large. We took the advantage of it two days in a row. I love the real taro with milk and my hubby enjoys the one with milk tea. Both are tasty. 

Keep up the good work coco."}
{"text":"Pearl tea, a bit on the sweeter end if you opt for \"regular sugar\". 

I always take regular ice and sugar, but man, the pearl tea tasted like 1.5 extra sugar. It's still yummy Boba, but if you're sensitive to sweetness, you may want to request for a little less sugar. 

Space wise, pretty small. It had about 4 tables for 4 people each, at the front. At the back, there's a table for two people. So ya, do the math on the seating :p

I guess if you're just there for a grab and go, it's a good place. It's not exactly the roomiest place to chill if you're a group. 

The pearl tea was not bad at all."}
{"text":"Coco is the only bubble tea place I go to now. I judge a bbt chain by how well they are able to make their regular  milk tea. They make an excellent, creamy and strong flavoured milk tea which I order with 30% sweetness (not a fan of pure sugar drinks) and it is perfect for my tastebuds. I also like to order pudding with my milk tea over tapioca and I find that Coco gives me the most pudding out of all the other chains. The pudding is also not too sweet and is very creamy to match the milk tea. Sometimes I just order the Pudding Milk Tea with extra Pudding!!!

I brought my cousins here from Ottawa and they had Bubble Gaga and Mango Green Tea and they both thought their drinks were excellent. The only thing that stopped us from going three days in a row was the fact that it was closed! The girls working there are very friendly and they offer very good customer service too. There was one time they left one of their specials out a day too late and I wanted to order it not knowing the special wasn't available anymore however they honoured my special order and just took the sign down. I know many chains who would not do this so I appreciated this small gesture."}
{"text":"Honestly, Coco is probably my favourite bubble tea place at the moment. Their milk tea has this very rich taste to it and it is extremely refreshing. The service is quick compared to many other places and the free wifi always works. Not to mention the prices are extremely affordable and quite cheap. If you're looking for a bubble tea place to hang with your friends, Coco is that place! My favourite drinks would be the 2 Ladies and the Taro Sago Milk Tea. This place isn't always packed for no reason! I definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"After being reached out by the owner, she had missed the fact, we had someone who isn't capable of standing and waiting for their order.

A few messages were sent back and forth, the owner finally realized that her employee was very unprofessional and apologized for the matter.

She stated, her employees will be all re-trained to accommodate those with needs."}
{"text":"Drinks were okay but the customer service was pretty bad. If I was to get a milk tea with tapioca they would of given another small one for free but because I wanted grass jelly they didn't. Overall disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"As somebody who drinks bubble tea often, I know of all the bubble tea spots and I can say that cocos is the best. All the toppings are great (pudding mmmmmm) and drinks too. I have a couple favourites: matcha macchiato with pudding (shake it up for macchiato to spread), 3 guys with less sugar and lemon king with sago. Cashiers are so friendly and always help out if needed."}
{"text":"Amazing little bubble tea joint. The tea itself is great, and the toppings (tapioca, pudding, jellies, red bean, etc.) are all fresh and taste great. Definitely better than most other bubble tea places around the city."}
{"text":"CoCo is my favourite bubble tea store in the GTA. Prices and specials are amazing, workers are great, and the atmosphere is nice. The menu is extensive and always appealing whether it's your first time there or your tenth. Compared to other bubble tea stores in the GTA, I feel like drinks at CoCo are a lot more potent and flavourful, which is great considering you're paying for a drink.

As for my thoughts on the Mississauga CoCo... Everything's great except for the fact that their seating area is so small and the ordering area can be really tight if there are a lot of people in the store.. So if you're planning on coming to Mississauga CoCo for a chill night, hopefully you're lucky and can get a table."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular milk tea, but the tasted was alright. I found the tea was not strong enough, and it didn't taste that special compared to the other cheap regular places. 

i guess its not bad to try something new in town :)"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a new bbt place was open in Mississauga! I've been to one of their NYC locations so having one close to home is great.

My sister and I dropped by this afternoon to try out their drinks. They currently have a promotion where you get a free bbt when ordering from the top 10 menu. We got the lemon king, bubble gaga, and two free bubble teas. The cashier was very friendly and knowledgable about the drinks. I got to try a bit of the lemon king and it was a refreshing lemonade. The bubble tea was good but nothing different from other competitors. Next time I'll try something different!

PS: There are only a few tables so this is more of a take out spot. Also, they also use the Vicinity point cards."}
{"text":"Coco's bubble teas are a nice change from Chatime and Bubble Republic's bubble teas in Mississauga, though I know some will say that they're all the same. Like other bubble tea places, they have many different types of bubble teas and toppings along with being able to adjust the sugar and ice amounts. 

My number one recommendation here is the taro milk tea with sago from here since the flavour is stronger compared to Chatime's watered down and powdery version. The Three Guys bubble tea (milk tea with pudding, tapioca and grass jelly) and the wintermelon milk tea are also good here but in a different way from Chatime and Gong Cha's versions of these drinks. In comparison, Chatime's milk tea is sweeter and same with Gong Cha's Wintermelon, even when you ask for 30% sugar and less or no ice. It all depends on your flavour preference. They also have a special of the month, where that flavour is under $4 for a large! Service is good and the wait isn't long compared to Chatime's!"}
{"text":"When my friend dropped the drink right after purchasing it, the workers sighed and gave us a dirty look. When my friend apologized, the worker barely looked at her. They didn't offer to give us another drink and when we asked, they said no you have to pay again. Its not like we dropped the drink on purpose. They made me feel unwelcomed and I am very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"They definitely have the best bubble tea in Mississauga! If it's your first time, try pearl milk tea it's the basic flavour made to perfection. There are so many options to try and they're all exciting and delicious. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Hidden behind Mastermind, across the parking lot, CoCo is apparently \"World's Largest BBT Brand\".  How come this is the first time I'm hearing about it?  Then again, I'm not a typical Asian person who frequents these places anyway, so I wouldn't know!

Space itself is narrow, but deep, with cash counter located in the back of the unit, behind a wall.  Strange set-up.  There were 6-8 tables max., so as per the other reviews, it's more of a takeout.

Just like Chatime, you can customise your sugar/ice level.  And they also had a couple of 'specials' going on:  Black Tea Macchiato & Red Bean Milk Tea, both available in large size for $3.99.  Drinks were ok, didn't blow me away, 30% sugar level still seemed quite sweet to me!

Thinking about it, CoCo is probably the most similar to Chatime.  As a person who doesn't frequent bbt places (too much sugar, I'm not a fan of powdered, artificial drinks), I really can't say what sets this place apart from other bbt places.

Parking might be tricky during peak dim sum hours as it shares the same lot as Emerald and it's located right on the corner of an L-shaped plaza.  Half the spaces are reserved for Mastermind and the other Wilcox lot is quite a distance."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly into BBT and I only really drink it 3-4x a year. However, from all my BBT experiences in the Mississauga area, this one is definitely better than Chatime but does not have as many options as Bubble Republic. Cocotea is in the same plaza as the famous Emerald dimsum restaurant and parking can be difficult if you come near dimsum hours or on the weekend. The shop itself is small unfortunately, and there is limited seating. It gets really crowded when there's a long line up to order drinks, which makes it so chaotic. I don't really feel comfortable chatting/hanging out with my friends here though; the place is already small and with the bar and washroom close by, it gets super loud especially when there's some sort of blending action going on. 

I have been here twice since they opened. I've tried the Yakult smoothie and the famous 3 Guys. Both were great and they made it according to my liking (zero sugar, regular ice). Feel free to customize it any way you like, the staff there is friendly. Follow them on social media (instagram/facebook) because they usually have a drink of the month for a discounted price! 

Props that I get to collect Vicinity points."}
{"text":"They offer a smaller menu compared to chatime and bubble republic but some of their drinks are better. Prices are average. 

I usually order their pearl milk tea, 2 ladies, 3 guys, wintermelon tea or the matcha milk tea. 

The pearl milk tea, 2 ladies and the 3 guys are all pretty good drinks. They are all almost similar but just have different toppings inside. 

The wintermelon tea is decent. It's not that much different compared to other places. 

As for the matcha milk tea. Coco is one of my favourite places to get matcha milk tea because their matcha milk tea here doesn't taste powdery or grainy. The drink is made perfectly and you can taste the matcha flavour. 

I've also ordered the lemon king before. It comes with a half a lemon inside the drink. The drinks really sour yet refreshing. 

Overall decent place for bubble tea. Lacks variety but if you're not going for anything unique it's a good bubble tea place. There's limited seating and free wifi too."}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 3.5/5
A good alternative to the other bubble tea places in the area. Drinks are good, and they have some items on the menu you can't get elsewhere.

Food/Drink: 2.5/5
The menu at CoCo isn't as large as some other bubble tea places. There aren't many green tea options, for example they don't have Lychee Green Tea. From what they do have available on the menu, the drinks are good. CoCo offers Sago as a topping, which is almost like mini-tapioca, something that you don't find often at bubble tea. Their banana smoothie beverages are also made with real bananas. Prices are as you would expect, around $5 for a bubble tea.

Service: 4/5
Service is very quick in comparison to the other bubble tea shops around, usually in and out of there in about 10 minutes. They go the extra step to even shake your drink and wiping any excess on the outside of the cup before handing it to you.

Atmosphere: 4/5
Atmosphere is lively, with many people dining in, conversing and playing games. The restaurant is kept in clean condition.

Tips & Recommendations:
-Try the Banana Chocolate Smoothie
-Try the Pudding Banana Smoothie
-Parking can be difficult at times, the lot isn't very big
-Offers Vicinity

{"text":"Amazing drinks! Service always fast with great drinks made. The prices are very affordable, go here all the time. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"although the flavours the taro slush was good I must say I was disappointed considering there's competition right across the street for this place.

not enough variety and not enough space. my co-worker and I decided to get some bubble tea after our dinner for dessert. The place was cute so don't get me wrong its just not enough space. They had a very limited chairs so this is definitely a to go place.

what really got me was the service, it was maybe just a off night so I am not crossing it off the list, but I would love more organization and efficient service when I am in. 

I do have to give this place another try to determine my feelings for it."}
{"text":"My faves are the Taro Milk Tea with Sago Pearls and the 3-Guy.  Unlike the regular tapioca pearls, the sago pearls are much smaller, very soft and just slightly chewy. The 3-Guy with tapioca pearls, pudding and grass jelly is like three birds with one stone; the grass jelly is really good with a subtle herbal flavor.  Red bean matcha milk tea is just alright while the black tea macchiato is kinda bland."}
{"text":"This has been the utmost and disappointing service I have received. A colleague of mine and I went after work and received horrible customer service. Server cut us off while ordering, was very rude and abrupt. 

After asking to change his rude tone. We over heard the staff snicker and say, \"yeah I saw that\". I am under the impression my drink was tampered with. Something suspiciously was done. We saw him reach for a wet sponge as he was making our drink - but who knows.

I often don't leave reviews, but this was just a horrible experience. I wish nobody experiences service just as I have experienced tonight."}
{"text":"Good place to get bubble tea and other mike tea. They got Sago, which is really good. The wait time varies from 5-10 minutes. In general a five star to the milk tea."}
{"text":"Even though there are quite a few Bubble Tea places in 'Sauga, I always find myself coming back to Coco's. Ive probably blown a few hundred here in the last few months with my cousins. This is our frequent place to go, thanks to their nice variety and relatively fast service. 

The thing I love about this place is honestly the tapioca - I sometimes get double the tapioca in my drinks with sago. A bit overkill, hence the \"sometimes\". Honestly, I love the tapioca here. It's very satisfying to chew, and actually tastes pretty good. The sago is interesting too, I love it! It's very small and chewy. 

My favorite drinks here are probably either the 3 Guys (I think that's what it's called), the Mango Slushy or the Sago Taro Milk Tea. Well usually when I go, I'd get two or even all three of these at the same time to satisfy my crave. Very tasty drinks, especially with my extra tapioca added in. It's nice how they also ask your sugar and ice levels here, but I usual end up not changing anything. 

Service is very good, all the staff I've encountered were friendly  and patient. Only gripe I probably have is with the lines when it's busy, but it's understandable since the store is so narrow. Probably my favorite BBT in Mississauga, because it's let me down the least compared to other places like BR or Chatime. 

I'll definitely be back, I always get a solid experience, and honestly that's all I need."}
{"text":"Good bbt! Great environment! First time trying coco here and would try it again in other locations as well! I could understand why it's a world wide chain :) try the taro and the sago, two ladies!"}
{"text":"I remember eons ago when bubble tea was a powdery mix of sugar, food colouring, some tea perhaps, and more sugar.  Did I say sugar?  The past few years, we've had a huge influx of Taiwanese, Chinese, and other super popular Bubble Tea Brands from Asia and I'm glad for it!  You're able to customize the level of sugar and ice with far more inventive add ins .. best of all, it actually taste like real brewed tea.

We came late one Saturday thinking it wouldnt be so bad ... daaaaaang.  So this is where all the Asian high school seniors hang out.  Ok, I'm already sensing the Mean Girl vibe ... I guess I'm wearing the wrong pink.  All the tables were taken (and there's not too many to start) and the line is about 3/4 the length of the store.  It .. is... popular. 

The great thing is the service is on point and moves the line quickly.  Even though we saw the big line, the ordering here is very efficient with a dedicated staff getting the order and 3 people behind the counter are constantly making the drinks.  I would say it only took us a little over 7 minutes to get to the front.  

Like I mentioned, ordering here is easy... it helps to know what you like ahead of time and the big monitors above the ordering station help show you the most popular ones in addition to the other drinks.  I would say that this isnt your typical \"blueberry milk boba tea\" but more closer to the authentic boba tea in Asia.  Richer in tea flavour and creamier in texture ... these are far more enjoyable. Best part was that I dialed down the sugar content so i could blink later on and not crash heavily from the sugar.  

2 Ladies (aka. Coco black tea with pudding and pearl) - With 50% sugar and no ice, I found this hitting the spot on a warm evening.  Its quite good in flavour as the 50% sugar let more of the tea flavour come out.  The pudding and pearl gives it a bit more sugar so having it lower wasn't an issue.  The pearls were perfect... chewy but not needing to invest in another set of molars.  As someone mentioned, perfect for the inner child to use them blow dart style.  4/5

Coconut Coco black tea with pearls - Using the same milk tea as the 2 ladies, I liked this one too... even though the sugar was dialed down to 30%, I found it to be a bit sweeter than mine because the coconut jelly is quite already sweet. I did like how it added a nice coconut flavour. 4/5

If you're looking for the real Boba tea, definitely come try it out but dont expect to stay here ... it's quite busy and there's barely any tables available but it is worth the tiny wait to get the real deal over here in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Very cute decor, and staff that are super polite but not really quite on the attentive side. Unfortunately during 2 occasions out orders were slight misconstrued however promptly fixed or given vicinity points to compensate. Average bubble tea."}
{"text":"I LOVE CoCo Fresh Tea! It's my absolute favourite bubble tea store and practically the only place that I would go out of my way to buy some delicious milk tea. I personally think the milk tea here is really fragrant with a perfect ratio of tea to milk. I also love how they have milk tea options with a variety of toppings included already such as:
3 Guys (my go to) which contains milk tea with pudding, grass jelly and tapioca
Bubble Gaga - passion fruit tea with coconut jelly and tapioca 

The CoCo Fresh Tea team here in Mississauga makes the drinks really well and fast and they also have really good customer service! Please continue to expand and open more stores CoCo!"}
{"text":"I was around the area and wanted to try something other than Bubble Republic so I decided to check this place out!

The interior decor is very cool, and unlike Chatime, I felt customer service here was much better.  They had a special for their Medium Green Matcha Bubble Tea so I decided to take advantage of the bargain...

To be honest, it was a bit too sweet for my liking, but it was good nevertheless.  I'd love to return and try out another flavour! Hoping to update my review then... but otherwise I would recommend this place.  I mean, this place apparently is the largest bubble tea chain in the world... there's a reason why, right?"}
{"text":"Ordered the promo roasted milk tea. 1/5 taste. It was watered down (even though I asked for no ice), no taste of any tea at all. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Coco opened near my neighbourhood and I have been going since their opening specials. 

I like how they have weekly or monthly specials - and you can join vicinity to get your 11th bubble tea for free!! 

The drinks are consistent, the tapioca chewy, and you can choose to add no sugar and ice. 

There's a small seating area, but it can get loud. It's more of a take out place. Other than that, it's welcoming and clean. 

Depending when you go, expect to wait for your drink. 

Verdict: I go there about three times a month. I know, I'm bad, but it's good!!"}
{"text":"CoCo has quickly become my go-to BBT chain when I want some bbt. This location has been the most consistent (drinks, service, etc ...) for me, so I usually go to this one. My favourite drink from them is their Matcha Milk Tea, it's so good."}
{"text":"As a bubble tea fan I always like a quick bubble tea to go  while running errands. Service is really quick and you are in and out in no time at all.  I dont really have a go to from here but I have tried a bunch and i just go with the flow when ordering.  It tastes really great with not too much ice or excessive sugar . Do try Coco  out and hopefully the rest of the bubble tea places  in the  area."}
{"text":"I don't think I have a favourite bbt joint but coco is pretty good. A little far away from my area so I only go when I'm near hurontario/eglinton. Sometimes it can get really busy and this store is SO small as compared to the other ones I've seen in Markham. If you're going with a big group of people.. chances are you won't find a seat to chill and relax. Good luck finding parking too when the plaza gets super busy. 

My favourite to go drinks:
3 guys 
Matcha milk tea hot or cold
Taro milk tea 

They accept vicinity cards and I love this rewards program because a lot of stores use this too. If you come here often enough, it's probably easy for you to get a free drink haha. 

3* for location. Store is soooo small
4* for drinks and service"}
{"text":"This bubble tea shop offers a smaller variety of drinks. I like their milk teas here. Their flavors are better than chatime for drinks like matcha milk tea, black milk tea and wintermelon tea. 

The drinks here are good but the service is horrible. The past few times i've been here there was barely any line but drinks take like 20minutes. However, they are getting better.  As the most recent time I visited they had more staffs and the drinks were really quickly made."}
{"text":"Good selection of tea, and great tapioca. Im really picky with my tapioca -- it needs to be chewy enough but not too chewy. For the price and quality of tea, Coco is the best place in Mississauga right now (better than Grotto and Chatime imo). Id say go for the 3guys or 2ladies, its a great combo. You may want to ask for less sugar though. Not as much seating vs Grotto, more of a grab and go place."}
{"text":"3 stats because this location is STUPID busy on weekends and you will literally be waiting in line for a good half an hour-45 minutes. Kind of worth it for the banana pudding smoothie. The only thing I order there and it's"}
{"text":"Came to this coco couple times cuz it's beside my boyfriends house. Love their drinks and the staff were friendly. Satisfied."}
