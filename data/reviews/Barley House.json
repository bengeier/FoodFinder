{"text":"One of the best patios in Cleveland! The staff was very friendly as well as pleasantly good looking. I tried the chicken pesto sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was delicious! The happy hour was also one of the best I've been to, 3$ craft beers and tall domestics. I'm looking forward to coming back on a Tuesday for the taco special!"}
{"text":"I was drunk by the time I got here visiting friends over Christmas break but the atmosphere was great and the staff was friendly dealing with my drunk behind! I will go back once I'm back in Ohio.."}
{"text":"Well the management did get in touch with me after that review, offering to show us a good time the next time we're in town. That's obviously appreciated but then again, the chances all 4 of us are in Cleveland again may be slim. They could have blown me off or tried to argue with me on Yelp so I appreciate the effort. 
Any place willing to do that is worth checking out a 2nd time but I guess try before you buy is the lesson here."}
{"text":"I'm going to strongly advise against going to this place--even when Charlie Sheen is there (I guess I should have known).

I was completely and utterly appalled by how rude and aggressive the bouncers were towards myself and others when I visited last night. Charlie Sheen was in attendance and was on the stage. Obviously, I was trying to get a picture of him, but I'm really short and there were lots of tall people in the way, so I stood on the steps near the stage and held my phone up to try to get a shot. The bouncer at the top of the stairs VERY AGGRESSIVELY swatted my hand and phone down and then shoved me off the stairs into the crowd. I was in disbelief, there was absolutely NO justification for the bouncer to become physical with me in the manner that he did. I'm a small, non-threatening woman who would have been fine with simply being asked to not take pictures. 

A few moments later, a guy in the crowd near me tried to get up on the stairs for a picture and a different bouncer shoved the guy's hand (with his phone in it) down hard and directly into my face.

I will NEVER return, and I hope y'all don't either. Go across the street to Dive Bar or Velvet Dog instead, your probability of being assaulted by staff will be significantly lower."}
{"text":"I just moved to Cleveland and the first place I checked out was the barley house! It seemed to be the busiest place on the street and when I walked in I got greeted with a smile from one of your employees! 
I sat down and noticed that you can pour your own beer!! Very cool. 

When I looked at the menu I thought it was going to be just the typical bar food... Who knew they had healthy options! I had an amazing salad and will definately be back to try out some of the other items! 

Very impressed !!"}
{"text":"Fun atmospheres, drinks were ample and food was fairly good for bar food. The bar is well stocked and the pricing for the food and drinks was a value for the money. I thought that service was slow, and not very friendly. Wait staff seemed to be young, and not very interested in good customer relations, more interested in whatever was on their phones. 
They took our chairs and made me and my husband stand for and event that didn't happen. Shm!"}
{"text":"Great burger, service was just OK"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, the music is always good. However, it is ALWAYS overcrowded and I'm pretty sure it is in constant violation of  some sort of Maximum Occupancy law. Theres no room to dance unless you're in the VIP section."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection and reasonable prices.   Weird crowd on weeknights.  Lots of old guys harassing the staff.  Live DJ trivia in progress if that's your sort of thing.  Asked for a Yuengling and noticed an obvious stale mis-pour being taken below the bar and magically being re-served to me.  Bartender used stirrer straws to whip up a fresh foamy head on the beer.   Good bar for a big bunch of bros having beers.  Not really a great spot for the food menu or couples."}
{"text":"I've heard every range of commentaries on Barley House that is possible. In my opinion Barley House does a better job at reinventing itself throughout the day then anyone. It is most certainly an Irish pub for lunch and happy hour. It is a sports bar for any big sporting event. And it is a packed night club with incredible DJ's, Vegas style lighting and great sound system. 

The staff is very professional and go out of their way to make you feel special and wanted. They have more security then any other club on West 6th and my entire party always feels safe and secure. They actually have a great VIP area and an enclosed open air back \"grotto\" for those that want to have walls around you but still have fresh air. Then there is the side patio complete with Cabanas and outdoor televisions to hang with friends, have fresh air and still catch the game.

One thing I think that is overlooked is the food. They have an awesome selection of items from simple bar food to salmon and crab legs (which are all you can eat on Monday's for like 20$). 

Just my opinion but I spend my money there consistently for a reason. Great environment, staff and experience."}
{"text":"Well if your here for the food your in the wrong spot, BUT the foods pretty good.   You come for the beer and view and you cant find better in cleveland.  Pull up a seat and watch the plad go by."}
{"text":"The Barley House sucks.  Period.

This has been my Barley House experience all 5 or so times I've been there on a weekend night.

Step 1... See a large crowd outside of The Barley House

Step 2... Friends say \"Hey!  Barley House looks packed, let's go there!\"

Step 3... Walk in and look around.  See the entire place packed with guys, no dance floor, and no room to order at the bar.

Step 4... Say to your friends \"Umm... I gotta hit the bathroom.  Want to do that first, then get a drink?\"

Step 5... Friends agree and you shoulder past 50 feet of sweaty guys leaning over the bar.  Half them briefly glance out of corner of their eye see if a hot girl is in your group, then go back to trying to order a Bud Light.

Step 6... Go into restroom.  Chuckle for 5 seconds about the pictures above the urinals.

Step 5... Awkwardly accept a hand towel from a bathroom attendant

Step 6... Meet up with your friends at the back of the bar.

Step 7... All collectively agree that it's \"really hot in here\" and you'll \"just do one drink then head out\"

Step 8... Spend 5 minutes waiting to flag down a bartender

Step 9... Order a very simple drink or beer (they can't do complex drinks right... even if they're a special I've found out)

Step 10... get one of those $5 or $8 test-tube shot glass drinks from a server walking around (which actually are pretty good).

Step 11... Finish your drink and leave.

So if that sounds like fun, then give the Barley House a shot... if not try Liquid or Drop Bar Instead."}
{"text":"If you're 21 or 22 or still in college,  this is your spot downtown.


....on the plus side, this is only bar in cleveland I've been in  that encourages Beer Pong.  However,  it seems like only 5 total people know how to play this \"exotic\" game."}
{"text":"I really think this place is a solid 3. But, to be fair, I didn't sit at the bar, I wasn't standing, and I wasn't out later than 10pm. So, with that said, my experience was pretty fair and tame. Nothing crazy happened, nothing was too irritating and our service was good for the most part.

When we first got here, we expected much worse, but we were quickly greeted and sat at a GIGANTIC table (for 2?!). We took the awkwardness of it with grace and decided to lounge a bit. For everyone's sake, I hope they wipe those booths down, because I'm pretty sure a lot of feet end up on them when they're that large and spacious. Our waitress quickly took our drink orders and got us our first beers in decent time. But, then we started wanting some food to soak up that alcohol (I was running a race the next day and didn't want to compromise it with a bunch of beer sloshing around in my stomach the night before). As we got hungrier and our beer glasses got emptier, we realized the only way to get her to come back would be to finish our drinks. Which completely ruined the point. We wanted beer and food. 

When we finally got food, it was pretty standard bar food and nothing to rave about or remember particularly...

All in all, I'm not sure I'll be back without a particular reason, but it was a nice night. (Aside from the weird married guy making extremely inappropriate comments...my comebacks about his wedding ring came to me about 10 minutes too late. Oh well!)

Also, worth mentioning is the bathroom. They did have a woman working in there doing \"towel service\" or whatever you call it. And it was completely out of place and unexpected; I didn't bring my purse and couldn't tip her, so I ended up feeling like a big jerk. I just don't see the need for it in a place like this, but maybe I'm mistaken."}
{"text":"Pretty typical downtown bar, can get really busy in the weekends or around browns games. They do food delivery on uber eats that is okay but doesn't all travel well, definitely better food delivery options available."}
{"text":"The Barley House can't seem to figure itself out. By day it's a beer bar, with Guinness logos everywhere and a better than average beer selection. By night it's a night club, with sparkling bottle service, sweaty dudes, and crappy music. 

We came here after dinner, got drinks, and stood at tables in the main area of the bar. After a while, we were told that those tables needed to be moved, so we had to move. The party seated next to us was leaving, so we sat at those tables. 10 minutes later we were asked to leave that area yet again, because those tables were now reserved for \"VIP bottle service\". 

So we stayed for a bit, the house music was  turned up, and the place was transformed into a club. After we had had our fill of the influx of jersey shore looking girls, sweaty dudes with graphic button down shirts, and the always annoying bathroom attendant, we made our way out. 

On our way out I heard someone talk about their friend being in a line outside. I remarked to my friend, \"Why would anyone stand in a line for this place?\". Upon exiting, I came to find out that over 50 dudes would be willing to stand in line outside in the snow waiting to get into that place. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"This is an Irish bar in name only. I am not sure what the owners were thinking when they decided to put in this faux Irish Bar in Cleveland, of all places. We know Irish bars, and we know this is really just a place for hambones and hooknasties to get their liquor on. That being said, it seems well managed and clean. So, where it fails as an Irish pub, it succeeds as an Hambone Haven. The servers wear short kilts, bringing in more hambones, which spawn more hooknasties. 

 I was super excited because the only nice bartender from the Riverwood works there now. Bad news for the Riverwood, but good news for the Barley House. She is pretty nice."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go if you want to hang and drink beer with your buddies.   Good music, older style bar, opening seating and airy.   There are 2 tables that have kegs taps attached at the table.  Plenty of tvs to watch sporting events. 
Now for the food, it was ok and defiantly not my top choice.  Was defiantly edible but didn't match the description on the menu. I had your choice of chicken, tofu or shrimp Asian budda bowl, love the idea of but execution wasn't all that great.   The sauce that it was to come with was a peanut sauce, so I thought it would be similar to a Thai peanut sauce, nope this was more of a sweet chili sauce.  So it was just ok. 
The Reuben looked good and my friend said it was rather tasty. All the sandwiches came out on Texas toast style/thickness in a variety of flavors   

Come out for: 
Beer, friends and hang out- yes!!
Food- not so much :("}
{"text":"Love this place! Hands down best restaurant/bar/club in Cleveland. Some friends & I came in for lunch & it was a great experience. We sat in a cabana on the side patio. We later found out that at night they do VIP at night. We came back that weekend & the table service was a blast! Great service & there was a great looking crowd. I recommend the place to anyone looking for a great meal or looking to party!!! Was also nice to see such a nice cigar menu."}
{"text":"I went to a birthday party at barley house not too long ago. The back room was rented out and we had access to our own bar. We also had hookah (had no idea they had this here!) I have to say that under these circumstances barley house was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Traditional Irish bar?  Methinks not.  But hey, they have a shit-ton of beers to choose from and a great outdoor patio.  The DJ on Wednesday night is very good.  A good, dare I say frat-boy meets urban crowd but it's still a cool bar."}
{"text":"The Barley House is a great place to go if you don't have tickets to the game. Don't worry about your neck cramping if you want to watch the game. Barley has a lot of tvs and the atmosphere is filled with a respectable crowd. The service and food never disappoints. Every time I'm in Cleveland this is usually my go to place."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday with some friends. Nothing special. I ordered food but it did not taste that great. It was also super crowded and the bathroom smelled really bad. Might come back on a weekday instead next time."}
{"text":"I was with Mark S and I can't really add to what he said. We were asked to move not once, but twice, and then give such attitude by the table-movers and waitress that I wanted to leave asap. The waitresses also perform awkward, soul-crushing dances on stage, that just made me sad."}
{"text":"Look. You know what your'e going to get here. You're not at Barley House because you're feeling classy, or want a quiet night. You're here because you want to drink, you want to dance, and those options are really pretty limited in Cleveland.

PROS:

-No cover
-Good DJs (usually. DJ Donkis - you're my fav!)
-Reasonably priced drinks
-Dancing
-A slight stage to dance on
-People watching
-When it's warm, outside areas

CONS:

-Way too much space devoted to table service, typically filled with obnoxious groups of men who will ask anyone to join them. No thanks, I'm good.
-Some strange characters, including a man who literally picked my roommate and I up before the bouncer told him to stop (thank you bouncer!)
-Not many places to sit if you aren't getting bottle service - dancing in heels is exhausting, folks!
-Long bathroom lines, and a bathroom attendant. She's really nice and knows some of the regulars, but I always feel uncomfortable - I can turn the water on myself! The bathrooms are also realllllly small so it gets very crowded.

Overall....well, you know what you're getting in to.

I have also been to Barley House once during the day, to watch football. The bartender wasn't very attentive, even though there were only 5 or so people sitting at the bar. I ordered some waffle fries (yum), but was a little disappointed with the lack of options on the menu (plussss was just craving some mozzarella sticks). The popcorn machine was a nice touch for free bar nibbling, but it must have been run hours earlier and was nearly empty when I scraped the last pieces from it. No one bothered to refill it in the three hours I was there."}
{"text":"The Barley House is my favorite place to go to, whether its for cocktails or a night out on the town. They have a DJ Wednesday through Saturday and is the best spot to dance , meet people or to be scene. They have a brand new lighting system so it has that Vegas style feel. Also I recommend checking out their back room, The grotto. It is the only bar in Cleveland that allows Cigars and smoking. There really isn't another bar thats comparable to Barley. Theres always a good crowd, and even if its a quiet time while you are there, the bartenders and servers will always chat it up with you, and I may add , there is pretty scenery there.  :)"}
{"text":"0/10. Tried this restaurant for the first time when I was in Cleveland. Horrible service, food, and drinks. The staff was rude and the food tasted bland."}
{"text":"Well drinks were weak and the pretzel bites, pizza and chicken fingers were nothing special. However, trivia night was a BLAST and the decor was right up my ally."}
{"text":"Idk about all the complaints but I like this place. Although I never had dinner or a sit down experience here just drinking and dancing silly:)"}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by saying this. This review is only for their nightclub. I did not get a chance to try their food, so I cannot leave a comment on that. 

First off, if you are a nightclub you should really consider mopping the floors every single day. Or at least use a material that doesn't become sticky when alcohol hits it. The floors were so sticky the night that I went it felt like someone could have lost a shoe during the night. In fact, one of my friends even made that comment. 

That being said... The music was pretty good. The selection was decent and fun to dance to while I was there. They had a bit of everything and the DJ was able to get the party going. It also helped that it was St. Patrick's Day weekend and everyone was out for a good time. For once, this was a place that I didn't get overheated in the first five minutes of being there. The bartender was also great in the fact that she helped me in getting a good drink. It had the right amount of alcohol to mix ratio. I hate the after taste of some types of drinks, so this drink definitely stood up to a good taste. 

Would I come here again? For food, I would love to try it. For nightclub, maybe. This is still not a bad experience overall while I was experiencing life in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have been to the Barley House in Akron and really loved it. The food and service was great and I have been there for lunch and late night. However, the Cleveland location has disappointed me quite a bit with the service. First we were seated outside on the patio, which was fine with me, but at one of the lounge seat arrangements where the table was maybe 2-3 feet from the ground. So it was very uncomfortable to eat. The service was very slow and hardly paid any attention to our table. And when she was there she didn't seem like she cared that much. I understand if you're busy, but at least apologize for the lack of service. 

Other than the service and the uncomfortable seating, the food was really good and the décor and atmosphere was nice. I would suggest going here when you aren't in a hurry or if you don't mind eating in your lap on occasion."}
{"text":"Very happening bar downtown with plenty of boy and people around.  Many young professionals, beautiful people come out here, which is A MAJOR PLUS.  Always packed and lines usually at the door around 12.  Plenty of outdoor smoking space, but small dance floor.  the owners are very gracious whenever I come.  I enjoy my time here when I'm on the 6th.  The atmosphere is not the hippest, but it's always busy with many cute boys :)  But do expect to pay roughly 6-7.00 per a drink (ex.Cran and Vodka) when the owners don't treat you."}
{"text":"Someone couldn't decide if they wanted to open a pub or a club. So they opened up Barley House-- a pubclub.

I was back in Cleveland for Memorial Day Weekend and came here after the cav's 2nd game in the finals.  The place was high-energy and fun. Great music, although small dance floor.  All around, I was impressed."}
{"text":"Barley what? Barley house!! The brunch was A1. Lots of butt and skirts, adam got eggs Benny , woot woot baby, Al got the biscuits and gravy and has been on the gravy train ever since.....choo choo next stop: PayDay!  And then there's becca. What a babe (als a babe too)"}
{"text":"Done lifting and tanning? Think that sappy John Legend song was vastly improved by the blasting-bass EDM remix? Got a pack of dudes with you, and want to hang out with similarly dressed dudes, stand shoulder to shoulder pushing for a bud lite at the bar, and maybe fight someone? This is your place. 

Sarcasm aside, this place is way better than just about all the other clubs on W. 6th, and it definitely was my go-to place when I was in clubbing mode. And, I've been there once for an afternoon football game, and it was a ton of fun. Table taps? Well played. Apparently, the food is good... but I've seen too much at the bar/dancefloor to eat there. I'm sure the kitchen is clean and professional.. but no thanks. I've got enough self-loathing the morning after drinking here, and let's be honest, I'll stumble over to Gyro Guy to really stuff my face before the booze wears off and my conscience takes over.

So two stars for Barley House. People reading this might tell themselves they won't go there, but then when you walk down W. 6th, it will be the only place with people in it."}
{"text":"Soooo torn, I've had the best happy hours here, but the worst nights out.  And bad food.  Browns games are good though.  I think there's a theme, I hate shitty dance clubs in decent bars.  Nailed it.  The patio is really awesome and they are charitable.  I've switched it from 2 to 3 to 2 to 3 since I've been writing this...  charity gives them an extra but it could be a bar with a patio and it'd be 4+.  I guess they gotta play to their location and have a dance club, I also guess I gotta play it right as to when to go there and when to avoid it.  Oh god, they have a stupid bathroom attendant too."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better, check out the newly remodeled back patio and i gurantee your idea of what a man cave should look like will be shattered. On top of this amazing addition Barley has added a state of the art light system which is insanely cool to watch. I dont just enjoy the weekend nights either the back patio makes a great hang out and relax or do paperwork/homework spot during the week while enjoying some tacos or a pizza. Not that i would have a beer and study or anything..."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour!!! Brittany was great. One entree is plenty to share. T.V. Are new and this place doesn't smell like the night before. Super cute live music guy who can actually sing!!  Check it out."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Barley House.  The staff was more that friendly and fun.  The beer selection is crazy good and the drinks are just delightful.  Looking forward to going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend Barley House if you haven't tried their new menu yet! The service was friendly, and gave many recommendations. We split the confit wings for an appetizer, and they were like nothing I've ever had before. They were unbelievably tender and the Thai chili sauce was incredible. My boyfriend was practically licking the bowl. I tried the Ohio City pasta with pomodoro sauce. It was cooked perfectly! I was so full, but couldn't resist the apple fritter for dessert. All around great experience and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 11pm, and this place was pretty empty. But you know what that means? More room on the dance floor woot woot! The music was a mix of top 40s and house, which I have no complaints about. Around midnight, there were significantly more people, so come around that time if you're not fond of empty bars/dance floors!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I don't understand why Barley House has negative reviews. This place is awesome!! 

First of all, for all the twentysomethings living downtown, Barley House is a great place to go on a Friday or Saturday night. The music is always good and fun to dance to, drinks are fairly easy to get and there is always an interesting crowd. 

Second of all, the food is delicious! The salad bar is always fresh, the soup is served hot and on Mondays they have all-you-can-eat crab legs! Hello people!? crab legs!!!

Lastly, and I must say I am a bit biased being an OU alumni myself, but this place hosts OU Bobcat events allllllll the time. So for all you Ohio University students and alumnis, this is the place to be in CLE."}
{"text":"Was just at barley house this past weekend and had an awesome time. There was this super good DJ that they brought it!!! Can't wait till their patio opens up!!"}
{"text":"I am not from Cleveland.  The concierge at the Marriott told me to go to Barley House after I asked him where a decent sports bar was.  He must get a kickback for the recommendation.  So I walked down to sixth street and as I was walking I felt a leaf or bug or something hit me (foreshadowing).  When I arrived at Barley I still had enough time to try out for next season of Big Brother.  There was no line and the dj was basically begging people to audition.  I looked around at the half empty room then sat at the bar in front of a flat screen tuned to the NFL network.  My bartender was one of four different petite girls in plaid mini-skirts.  I was wearing business casual and would have fit in much better had my shirt been tighter, more v-necked and had more dragons on it.  For my first ten minutes at the bar I didn't have a bartender.  Then little girl walked up to me and said: \"did you want a drink or something?\"
I ordered an extra dry, dusty Belvedere martini.  She said: \"is that like with the olive water?\"  I said, \"Yeah, just a little bit though.\"  She shook up my drink and served it with a short fat neon green straw that looked like 1/3 of a boba tea straw.  I took a sip and hated her for putting in so much vermouth.  

She ignored me for another ten minutes before I finally made eye contact with her long enough to ask for a menu.  I ordered a turkey pineapple sandwich that I thought sounded like a Muslim friendly Hawaiian pizza or something.  When she took my order I asked for one of the four special sauces that are supposed to come with their waffle fries.  She said, \"The fries come with ketchup.\"  I said, \"Right, but I noticed on the menu you advertise four special sauces that you recommend pairing with the fries.\"  Her, \"most people just get ketchup.\"  Then she walked away.  That bitch, god I hated her.  She made me feel like i was sitting in a cool person's seat at the high school cafeteria.  \"Bitch I'm a paying customer helping your douche bar stay in business in an unfriendly economy, You need to serve my ass with a smile.\"   A male bartender noticed me looking helplessly around the bar for help after little girl deserted me.  He took my bacon - chive fry dipping sauce order.  

Sandwich came and tasted shitty.  Fries came with the sandwich and tasted fantastic, thank god I had that dipping sauce.  I didn't finish and I asked for my bill as soon as I took the last sip of my martini.  Little girl tried to put on a false friendly front in time to salvage her tip, but I wasn't playing that  game.  She got a 12% tip, which is the lowest I've ever given.

So now I'm back at the hotel enjoying a Sam Adams.  Earlier my hands were a bit greasy from my Turkey pineapple sandwich so I went to my Marriott sink to wash them.  When I looked up at myself in the mirror I noticed a silver dollar sized splotch of bird shit on my forehead / hairline.  Apparently it wasn't a bug or a leaf; FUCK!"}
{"text":"Why all the hating on the Barley House?

Yes, this place is busy and crowded at night but guess what?  You can tell how crowded it is from the outside, i.e., PRIOR TO GOING IN.  If crowds are an issue for you, don't stand in line watching one form, enter the bar to find yourself in the middle of it and then complain how you got there and why you're in it..  

Beyond that, Barely House is through in and through out a place that pulls no punches.  Yes, their name is Barley House and they serve \"irish influenced fare.\" Psh...doesn't make it an Irish pub, kids, so stop complaining that this is an Irish pub that's parading around as a club.  It IS a club and  a pretty good one, I think. I don't mind crowds and I don't mind loud music or dancing in a huge pool of strangers when I'm in the mood for it sooooo Barley House, in moderation, is a pretty cool place.
That's why people come here after all.  Because somehow between all the other bars/clubs/restaurants, Barley House fills a void for them, whether it's guys who want to hit on girls who don't care listen to them, or girls who want to walk around in a skimpier-than-skin dress JUST to see how many people will give them a second look, or people who just want to take part in a scene that seems to give a damn.  If it doesn't fill a void for you, then don't go.  Pretty simple."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to say I have set foot in this place. Not my type of place at all. I hate having to scream at the top of my lungs when I'm trying to hold a conversation. I'm probably just too old for places like this.

If you want to find some of the dullest, dimwitted folk in Cleveland, come to the Barley House. Okay, maybe that's really mean... but true.

I always laugh at VIP sections in bars/clubs. This one is especially hilarious. It's just the other half of the bar, roped off. The people that were on that side thought they were really special. The security guards yelled at a friend of mine because she rested her hand on one of the VIP chairs. He said she didn't pay to rest her hand there. So she promptly took her martini glass and threw it in the VIP garbage can. Boy, did he get his panties in a bundle over that one! 

Good things about this place: drink service was pretty fast for a crowded Saturday night. Bartenders were really friendly."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner, so maybe it's Barley House burn out, but it's just not that great. The servers are all very young and pretty, but they were definitely hired because they are young and pretty. I've been for lunches, happy hours and a weekend event there. It's always busy, but even when it's not the service is slow. 

When I went to a weekend event (Cleveland Challenge: a 5K scavenger hunt) my team finished in the top 20 so we got a table right away and ordered drinks and food. The waitress was slow and kept rushing us with questions asking if we were ready to go. It was super annoying. 

With that said, the pizza is great, the salads just so so and the bar food is hit or miss. Lots of fun beers on tap and a decent non-meathead crowd."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the night time crowd here- fun, classy and diverse! Also check out the food menu; lot's of delicious options to choose from.  Service is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Barely House is one of the few places open 7 days a week lunch and dinner. I work downtown and eat there for lunch with free valet that is awesome. I have also partied there on weekends yes its busy when is the last time you wanted to go into empty club you dont that is why its empty. They have great vip area as well. They lots of events stogie pairings, guest djs, beer events and summer time fun."}
{"text":"I've only been once for my friends 21st but it was a lot of fun. We had been barhopping in the warehouse district and ended up here. Since it was a weekend it was PACKED! Seriously, if you like crowds it is the place to be. That night the bartender was walking around on the bar counter giving free shots to people from the bottle! XD

Pros: I have never tried the food so I have no opinion. But the dance floor was great, good DJ. The atmosphere was also great for a club!

Cons: The drinks were small and the price was high. Drink someplace else like Dive Bar if you want something at a reasonable price, then come here to dance."}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals! We were there on a Thursday around 6:30 and it was pretty low key. Seems like it would be a wild place later in the night and on the weekends. Young crowd. Service was ok and the food was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Crazy place with awesome music. Although it can get crowded I loved the place for the music."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite late night spots downtown. Great music and atmosphere perfect for big groups!"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of 30+ people to watch election night. As we were waiting for Obama's victory speech, the manager turned the sound off and refused, no matter how much we begged and pleaded, to turn it back on.
I have *never* been treated so poorly in a restaurant.
And the food, btw, was lousy. Avoid."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Maybe it's because I, like another recent reviewer, have common sense. If I don't like a very crowded bar at night, I don't go to it. 

I frequent the Barley House early in the evening, for lunch, and on trivia nights and I always have a great time. They have an excellent beer selection and good food. It's not gourmet but it's very good bar food / brewery style food that has healthy options and has more than just simple bar fare. They have a grilled chicken, shrimp, veggie, and brown rice platter that's my favorite. Besides that the wraps are great and they have sweet potatoes fries!

The decor in the place is nice but where it really excels in the Summer is outside. The sidewalk side outside is nice and good for people watching but on the side they have these awesome cabanas. Couches, nice music, live djs, and a relaxing atmosphere.

Usually the servers are nice, the atmosphere is relaxed, and it's a great Irish bar. It does transform at night and later after home Browns games but what do you expect for a bar right near the stadium and in a happening bar district? It's not pretentious so people flock to the place. If you don't like packed bars with a lot of people drinking, don't go here late at night or after a Brown's game. Every other time is great!"}
{"text":"Great place to start the night. Gets very crowded and hard to flow through the cutler of people. College age bar... Very mainstream atmosphere. Door service was great. Wouldn't mind seeing a better exclusive VIP area."}
{"text":"Okay...I've been in the Barley House quite a bit...not lately, but enough that Stefanie's review caused me to post.

She's right. The gals and guys that man the bar are really cool, especially Cleveland's other Stefanie. She's really sweet, and knew my name and drinks after just one visit.

Aside from that, yeah, the place can get pretty nasty...because, it's a party place. That's probably why it will also stay open. They nail down some good events in Cleveland (i.e. Shaq's Welcome to Cleveland Party).

BUT...my views are this: I sat out on the front porch on some lovely September afternoons, and had some nice lunches there. It wasn't knarly in the middle of the day. And they have some really good lunch specials...soup and salad for like 6 bucks.

Their BLT is AWESOME. As is their bbq chicken sammy.

And, they have Brooklyn Lager, a brew that always makes me misty for my last digs in NY, just 3-4 blocks from where they brew it.

So...I've already bounced between 3 and 4 stars a few times while composing this...I'm going to leave it at four, and here's why:

If you don't want to see hooknasties and douchebaggery, WHY IN THE HECK would you come here? They are going to be present. I promise. 

(Well, except for lunchtime during the summer, when it's an awesome place to sit out and get some air+sun at lunch.)

For what they aspire to be, they succeed spectacularly. 

It's not my kind of joint, really...but again the people there were always nice and quick. It's not too expensive either.

And a nice surprise lunch spot. 

All in all, I had to give it 4 stars. I think they're better than A-OK."}
{"text":"Awful Experience and Disrespectful Owner:

A friend and I stopped in this bar while visiting Cleveland that happened to be having a birthday party for Bill Bellamy. Someone invited me to join the VIP section after seeing me take a picture from my phone. As soon as I got there a man (white) told me that he \"wanted to impregnate me\" in a joking way. I ignored the comment. And found my friend who was also in the section. Not much later that, same man was popping a champaign bottle, and the cork hit my friend in her leg and me on my foot. She said something to him and his response \"I was trying to hit you in the pu**y\". She didn't hear this comment. He then started asking his girlfriend, while pointing at us \"which black girl should I pick?\" She apologized for his comment and told us not to listen to him. I then asked him if he always talks to women like that? He got mad and said, \"It was a joke. Next time I make a joke, you need to laugh!\" He repeated this several times. And I said \"Next time you make a joke you need to make it funny. I didn't laugh because it wasn't funny.\" He then told me he was the owner and that me and my friend could leave. I turned to try and tell my friend about how racist and ignorant this man was, as security came and made us leave. 

There was soooo much I wanted to say in that moment but something told me not to cause a scene. I've never been spoken to like that before. But I honestly don't know what could have happened to us if I had. Glad we didn't spend a dollar in that place, and I am posting this as a Facebook/Yelp and whatever other kind of review possible."}
{"text":"Worst place ever and the manager Mike is a total jerk. I went here on election night with a large group of 30+ people to watch returns. He turned off the sound on the TVs as soon as the returns were over and before the speeches, saying that the two other customers in the place wanted to listen to music. He refused to budge. He doesn't care about customers. We waited more than an hour for our food and the waitresses put the whole order on one bill instead of giving each table a bill. I have *NEVER* been treated so poorly at a restaurant. They clearly don't value their customers."}
{"text":"If you want to watch the browns and be treated mediocre , this is your spot! The food is actually pretty good and ALL 13 TVs will be on one game. However, if you are looking for enthusiasm and flexibility, this bar is not your place. No flexibility on programming and the attractiveness of the waitresses and decent food / prices only partially offset the attitude and lack of variety."}
{"text":"New menu

But no irish egg rolls

Nice looking gals

Bros at night

Above average outdoor space

Strict on boot policy"}
{"text":"I can only comment on their so called brunch, can you say terrible!! It wasn't even a brunch,it was more like over cooked stale breakfast  with no variety. THE \"CHEF\" (I HOPE HE WASN'T A CHEF)didn't even know how to cook a omelet. ...he PUT RAW veggies in what tasted like powdered eggs ewww!! only good thing about THIS  so called BRUNCH was unlimited mimosas,that's why I gave one star. NICE TRY BARELY HOUSE but no thanks,I feel like yall nicely robbed me."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for pre-Browns game festivities.  Think about renting one of the cabanahs, weather permitting."}
{"text":"Showed up here to kick a bachelor party from classy at the Velvet Tango Room into high gear. We chose Barley House because.. all of us were out of touch with Cleveland. Honestly, most of the bars on W. 6th feel about the same, so I can't fault Barley House for being hot and crowded (they tried to mitigate both problems with fans and a bad DJ). We got a round of some sort of whiskey shot that made half of us urge to heave. And this was to START the evening.

After the cast of Jersey Shore walked past us and behind the bar, we decided to peace out."}
{"text":"We were able to host a really great fundraiser here on a weekend night. We sold wristbands at the door for $25 and people could get unlimited draft beer, well drinks, house wine, and a selection of 3 appetizers for a 2 hour time period. We were able to keep half of the ticket price for our charity, and the staff were nice enough to also donate their tip to charity! Thank you!!!!

They had a good selection of draft beers, with rotating selections from different breweries. I was also surprised at how good their appetizers were. The pizza has a super crispy bottom of the crust, which I really enjoyed. Chicken tenders were also crispy and moist. Didn't really like the cheese pretzel balls, but that's how I expected all the food to be, so I was definitely pleasantly surprised!

Overall, barley house did a great job at handling our fundraiser. I would definitely recommend them for that! After the fundraiser was over, it did start to get super crowded, and turned into a bit of dancing (well, they had a DJ, but not many people were actually dancing), it was hard to get a drink since there were so many people. 

Overall, I'd give their fundraiser event 4 stars, but the rest of the night 2 stars. Not really someplace I'd recommend, but I would definitely have no hesitations about tagging along if my friends wanted to go!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I could not get enough of this place back in the day!!! The people got to know me and my crew after a while. The only recommendation is that they keep making the dance floor smaller and smaller by making more room for VIP. This is the only negative and its getting to tight in there to dance now. Other wise an amazing place to party."}
{"text":"Oh boy. The night started off decent at Barley House. Male bartender, super friendly. We received our drinks in less than 2 minutes and waited less than 15 minutes for our pizza. After that, the night went downhill. I did have two Christmas ales to make up for what was about to happen so at least my buzz was flowing. The music was extremely loud for the five people including myself and partner in the whole place. On top of that the music kept turning off and turning back on. So imagine being in conversation with someone and the music shuts off. While in mid conversation the blasting music turns back on. Very annoying. Almost like it was hooked up to someone's iphone and they were choosing what song they liked. Also, why do they have so many people working? There were more bartenders, servers and barbacks than customers. Not to mention they were all clustered together in a corner looking bored. Bartender walked by my glass serveral times before asking if I'd like another. They just didn't seem attentive. 
It seemed like if there were more customers this would have been a decent night so I'll give them the fact that it was dead,
But come on, if you're trying to create the whole facade, at least try.."}
{"text":"I've avoided this place for years. This weekend reminded me, again, why I never party there. After the 90s bar crawl they began turning the bar into a night club by removing all bar stools. Fine, no issue. There were 5 of us seated at the end of the bar, including my 55 year old mother and father who had joined us for a drink after dinner. The staff could not have been more rude in forcing my mom to get up from her chair, and then calling over another employee and arguing with us after we insisted we needed only a couple minutes to finish our drinks and we would be happy to leave."}
{"text":"This is a very lame excuse for an Irish Pub, but and is ONLY fun in the evenings if you roll up with a crew.  If you're looking to meet people - this is NOT the place to go.  After 20 minutes you'll be sweaty, confused, and blinded by all the metalic shirts.  

There are a lot of televisions though - which makes it alright for a sports game.  Just make sure to get out of there when they start clearing tables ...."}
{"text":"I went to the Barley House for the first time last week. I was very impressed with the interior design and general atmosphere of this upscale bar. It was packed and rightfully so. The drinks were priced fairly and the bar tenders were attentive. I'll be sure to stop at the Barley House many more times."}
{"text":"We often stop here for lunch on Friday's.  The food is good, the Irish BBQ Burger a personal favorite, and priced comparable to lesser establishments.  The staff is always fun and attentive.  Not in a fake \"Welcome to Fridays\" sort of way, but it seems they hire sincerely nice people. 

Though I have not been here at night they have an impressive selection of draft beers and offer a variety of Black & Tan's."}
{"text":"Incredibly nice and friendly staff! Especially Megan! Good Happy Hour prices. Boom Boom Shrimp was good. Got a delicious giant warm chocolate chip cookie for my Birthday!!
Had to leave before things got hopping. If you want to be here when it's busy come after 9 and Saturdays are supposed to be busier."}
{"text":"Love this place at all times of the day. They have great food with speedy service. At night turns into night club. Best in town. They always have great DJs from all over the world. Good job barley house"}
{"text":"Lindsey B was our server. It was incredibly busy yet she gave us fantastic service. Everything is good food wise."}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference.  Found this place and man was it awesome.  Had the chorizo nachos and pretzel plate. Both were excellent.  Our sever was great.  She was friendly and courteous.  Highly recommend going here.  But word or warning, bring a friend to share the pretzel plate it is 2 huge pretzels and if you eat them both yourself you won't have room for anything else."}
{"text":"I had a gift card I've been waiting to use.

My girlfriend picked me up from work and off we went.

5:30pm after work drinking crowd blah blah.

We wanted Steak...

We walked in and were shown to a seat....minutes roll by 3, 4, 5....waitress comes and asks if we've been helped, we said no of course and she said someone would be right over...

3 more minutes went by no one was over.

Walk Out.

Anyone want a free gift card?"}
{"text":"Well hello young Cinderella...
Now please leave your purse, smile, virginity (if you have such), faith in humankind/romance and Michael Kors shoes at the doors, since all of it will be puked on or stolen at this wonderful joint. In this purgatory drunk accounts in sweater vests from JCPenny, feeling overwhelmed with machismo after ordering a a sparkling sky vodka, will most likely grab your ass. Just because it's there and they feel entitled \"to your ass\" in VIP section. Along with Indian jail bait, local drug dealers, rapidly aging chuches and college dropouts. Barf.
Audiance is loose, drinks are diluted, bathroom deserves a different chapter. Run by a very melancolic looking Spanish woman  (who clearly needs antidperessants), it's overcrowded with puking 21-year olds in cheap sparkles and acne. I witnessed couple of fights in there as well. Ugly.  Oh how ugly. Management cannot care less. When they stole my purse in there, they didn't even bother to look for it. Did't even fake being concerned. \" What else were you expecting?\" - asked a bartender in a skirt barely covering  her crotch. Hmmm. \"Not being robbed?\"- I wanted to say. But she was already heading with another sky vodka towards drunk accountants in VIP section. 
I am aware of the fact that life can be rather ugly on west 6th. Nevertheless this place just congregates ugliness and serves it to you along with vodka that gives you a splitting headache minutes after drinking. I do not care about bartenders doing \" pseudo-\"dance of the little swans\" in stripper outfits on the stage covered with spits and bodily fluids, I do not care about strangers grabbing me. I love my shoes and my soul untouched.
I think world would have been better without bars like this. And most importantly - safer.
Up-side: You really don't get to spend any money in the next 24 hours since your credit cards are stolen 
Down-side: same as above"}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon for a couple of beers well before the soccer game this evening at first energy. The bartender was the one serving us as there was hardly anyone in the place when we entered. For the hour or so we were there more and more people kept coming in including more waitresses. We were sitting at a table directly across from the bar. But the bartender hardly ever looked at us. Once it was time for us to leave I had to walk up to the bar in order to ask for my tab.  It was a tiny tab. $8.63. I planned on leaving the change and tipping another couple bucks on the two beers that I drink. Not a big customer I get it. But when she cashed me out she didn't even bother to give me my change.  Told me we don't give change.  So the idiot prevented her self from getting a bigger tip. I hope she was happy with the $.37 she stole. She missed out on a tip because she needed to take that money from me.  F you!   Shippy customer service.   She also apologize when she served the beer because it was a little foamy. It was a little funny because it was a little warm. Check your beer lines!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Barley House over the weekend figuring it would be the perfect place to catch some games for March Madness. My friends and I were able to snag a table with the self-serving taps which was pretty convenient (although the 2-beer selection between Yuengling and something else...can't remember... wasn't what I would have liked). The games were on some tvs but not all of them, and it took some time to get them to turn on the stations we would have liked (keep in mind, there weren't many people there).

There's something about employees wearing skirts so short that I'm constantly afraid I'm about to see butt cheek that makes me lose my appetite. Maybe that's just my opinion. Our waitress was fine, but had absolutely no idea what they had in stock. I ordered 3 different drinks and every time she came back and said they did not have it.  Not only was I not able to find a drink I liked, but just the lack of knowledge kind of annoyed us. 

The food, however, was actually amazing! I had the lobster mac and cheese and about died and went to heaven. Everything was relatively cheap as well. We were there until about 8 when they began to lower the lights and transform the place into a dance club or something. We were practically the only ones left at that point and decided it was getting a little odd. 

In summary, I would come back during the day to grab some decent lunch and maybe some beer (if they have it in stock), and watch sports. Other than that, I might steer away!"}
{"text":"Whoever the manager was tonight should feel very lucky that I ordered this on ubereats instead of eating in the restaurant... my nachos didn't even cheese on them... not only that but I ate half the chips bare because the toppings they actually remembered to put on were about half of what they should have been."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The place wasn't even crowded. The waitress was rude and super short with responses as she replied. Never going here again."}
{"text":"This place is a tool shed. Wish the patio was open when I was there. There was a long line of people waiting to get in here, but when we got in there wasn't really anyone inside. Not really my scene."}
{"text":"To call this place an Irish bar by any stretch of the imagination would make Shane MacGowan himself pull out the last real 3 teeth he has is his Nancy Whiskey lovin head.  Everytime I come here I ask myself  \"WHY?\".  Well this time it was a Sunday afternoon and I felt like being Downtown and I had a coupon for buy 1 get 1 entree.  My seating options were sit outside where a few people were or sit inside, alone and listen to the manager creep on all the orange skinned chicks who cant get the prime Sat night shift.  The \"B\" team so to speak.  People watching is great here...the Downtown types with the aviators and the mid-40s tweakers who are still up from the night before.  The most exotic beer they had was #9 and Brookly Summer I think.  Places like this Bud Lite flows like KY at a swingers convention.  Consistantly we get servers here who can give a crap on making money.  They just want to play with their hair at the bar and worry about when their next tanning appointment is.  The food was decent because well, Its a chain.  The toilets are still worse than the one in Trainspotting.  Not even a soundtrack of Lou Reed could make this place cool.."}
{"text":"Night started off slow but then even with everyone there, there was still room at the bar to order drinks and not have to wait. The music was awesome too."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual night out with friends, watch a game or to celebrate a party. We came in for a bachelor party and the service was amazing! Those barley girls know what they're doing. The new patio is awesome, love the fireplace."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars for this place, I definitely would. If you are looking for a trashfest in downtown Cleveland, than Barley House is the place for you! After being shoved out of the way all night by the Barley House staff members without so much as an \"excuse me\" from any of them, my final straw with this place was as follows: I witnessed a Barley House server punch a paying customer in  the face 3 times because he was standing in her way. Are you kidding me?!? There was nothing more to the situation. Unreal. I don't know what kind of trashy individuals are being hired by this place, but I strongly encourage you to take your money and business elsewhere. The atmosphere sucks, the drinks are expensive, and quite frankly it is dangerous. Seriously people. This place is a JOKE!!"}
{"text":"Barley House is by far my favorite place in Cleveland.  We came here two nights and both nights were awesome.  They play house music all night and the DJ's are great.  I never ventured to the back bar area because I didn't need to.  

The main stage area and bar are more than entertaining and I would probably come here every night if I lived in Cleveland.  This bar is always busy but never too busy.  There is enough space to walk around and dance without feeling congested.  I've never been to a bar that plays strictly EDM and draws such a big crowd.  The music was more club like but the people were regular bar goers.  Barley House is a pretty awesome place and this would be the first place I would go when I come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"This was a great place for a quick work lunch. Everything was so good and the service was great. Too bad we couldn't take advantage of the table top taps though. The Reuben egg rolls were interesting but had good flavor. The Kobe beef sliders were delicious, the beef was so tasty. Tried the tofu and quinoa salad which had a lot of different flavors and textures, a creative mix. The soy Buddha bowl was a little bland for me. Coworkers chicken wrap was huge and chicken was moist. Another coworkers lobster Mac and cheese was delicious. Needless to say, we tried a lot on their menu and everything was good. Should definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"I ventured out to the Barley House on W. 6th after frequenting the original Barley House in downtown Akron. Let me tell you, toto, we're not in Kansas anymore. This Barley House is completely different than the one in Akron and if you like the one in Akron, DO NOT go to the one in Cleveland.

First thing I noticed was the giant line to get in, REALLY a line? Then once you're inside your surrounded by sluts and Jersey Shore-looking dude wearing Ed Hardy and Affliction tees, hair gelled to the max thinking they are the hottest people on the planet. I was here in the summer and the place was totally packed. I kid you not, I actually saw a guy sitting down while this slutty girl wearing no panties and a skirt that showed her whole ass bent over in his face. I didn't realize I was at a strip club.. oh, wait I wasn't.

The waitresses at this Barley House apparently have to wear little skimpy kilt outfits that make them all look so cheap. Not the case at the Akron Barley House. Plus, the place is a full-on dance club at night. So grimy. It was packed and everyone was so rude, pushing, gawking at you, grabbing your ass because it's there.. this place is miserable. We were there for one drink (which took forever to get because the bar is so crowded and the bartenders are brainless) and then we had to get out of there before we caught an STD. 

Seriously, this place is sad, disgusting and definitely nothing like the Barley House I know and love. If you want to actually have fun, head out to the Akron Barley House and stay away from W 6th. It's where the wannabe guidos go to drink too much and get freaky in public with women who clearly have no respect from themselves. Gross."}
{"text":"Skip this place. I don't know what it is about it that rubbed me wrong - maybe the sausage fest of douchey looking guys and ridiculously watered down drinks - but this place is one to skip. The music was decent but really the crowd was hella sketchy."}
{"text":"So, just back from the VIP table again, [boo-yah]. Our bottle server was nice, very efficient; our server even remembered my friends and me from our last time 6 months ago. The crowd was the same, with a tad more older sketchier guys in their late 30s+, gawking at the ladies...... 

The security guy slacked off again after 1ish, so anyone would walk up into the VIP area [I'm looking at you, sketchy late 30year old male, trying hard to be cool, to relive his past and gawking at the ladies, in your leather coat]. 

This time, there were not any floozies trying to get into our VIP area unlike last time, which kind of surprised me (although last time I went, which was VIP, it was their annual Halloween party...). Another one of my fellow party-goers passed out again [a different one than last time], though they didn't kick him out this time. I'm rating a star less because the atmosphere wasn't as exciting as my last time there although it was the Halloween party then. On the plus side I suppose, a josh cribbs look-a-like was in the VIP room and my drunk friends were claiming it was him until I actually talked to the guy and introduced myself and he told me his name was Clint."}
{"text":"I have been to The Barley House several times. Its just okay. The food is basic bar food.The waitresses dress in short skirts( Which i don't understand why) The decour is one note. I recently had the fish tacos. They were okay just spicy with too much slaw. no layers of flavors. I would go back but not my 1st choice."}
{"text":"This review is for night life only. Since I have never tried their food or been here before 11 pm, I'm uncomfortable giving it a flat out 1 star.

Let me give you a brief background on myself...I am 4'9\", not a fan of tight spaces, hate brushing up against strangers, and I like to dance with a good 1 foot radius around myself. All of this equals a very uncomfortable Teejay in said bar.

I walked in there and immediately thought to myself \"oh my god, I am going to die in here....\". I had visions of being crushed or trampled by drunk bar patrons, being elbowed in the head by some guy lifting his beer up for a drink or by douchy fist pumpers, or maybe I would contract some sort of illness from all the sweat my shirt was collecting from literally squeezing through the crowd. If it wasn't any of those, I was going to choke on the musty smell of vomit, sweat, hormones, and dry humping. Is this not a fire hazard? Seriously, someone tell me I'm right about the fire thing. If a fire started in there, I would be dead. No one is going to notice the tiny girl stuffed between drunk guy and birthday tiara girl. I was pushed away from my group and it took me 20 minutes to find them again. In that time, I could have been scooped up by some creep and buried by the interstate.

All in all, I did everything in my power to get out of there ASAP as I wiggled my way through everyone and finally caught a breath of fresh air. I was so angry by the time I was out on the street due to severe claustrophobia issues. This bar capacity needs to be regulated, period, the end."}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of the Barley House since going there one afternoon for lunch.  The food really isn't that good for the money you pay especially knowing the other restaurants I could have gone to instead.  

The afternoon I did eat there, all I got was the pizza.  It was greasy and oily in a bad way.  Trust me, I love the pepperoni / cheese oily goodness that can be a sign of great pizza but the one at Barley House didn't fare well with me and my wife.  This surprises me because I do like the pizza at Harry Buffalo (same owners) but for some reason they refuse to link the two.  This could have changed since I went there last so let's just keep our fingers crossed.

Recently I was there for a Browns game party bus from the east side.  We had reserved the back bar area which was great, however there was only one female bartender pouring free beers / drinks to about 60 drunks.  This did not fare well and we ended up about 5 deep waiting for drinks.  We decided that tipping her $20 right off the bat would help, and it did, drinks started flowing our way each time we peeked our heads toward the bar.  Let that be a lesson to you I guess....ha.

The entire bar was packed on a Sunday for game day so if that's your cup of tea then I highly recommend heading over there for some football but if a relaxing Sunday with good food and chilly brews is your preference, then let me suggest your local suburban sports bar where the bartenders know your name."}
{"text":"Halloween is approaching and Barley House is on top of it once again. With a festive feel and potent menu of suculent food combined with table service that is really easy on the eyes, Barley House proves once again why it is a premier spot to eat in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"After reading my negative review, the owner reached out to me and asked what he could to to make it up to me. He came off has a really dependable guy who really wants the place to be as good as it can be. and I have  had a much better experience having gone there since."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe when my twenty something son was not allowed in due to wearing boots. I double checked the website and it states dress is casual. I would think kakhis, button down shirt and boots would qualify!"}
{"text":"- They need a refresher course on race relations, I've had a lot of pals that hate that place and feel they were discriminated against. My personal experience and  opinion? Despite past friction with the manager of that place--I'm ok with the place. Ok girls, ok music, great place for noon lunch especially cheeseburgers and wings."}
{"text":"Okay, I had no idea what I was getting into when I came here.  If you're into overly crowded bars with terrible music playing too loud you might feel at home here.  Bonus if you like extremely dirty floors, bad drinks, and obnoxious drunk people (AKA the next case of Lake Erie Shore).  The only thing that made my 20 minutes in this place passable was the fact that they had a few decent beers on tap."}
{"text":"This place seems like a great location to have a drink with friends on the patio. While going there for lunch, they sat us at a small table outside for 5 people. We all ate uncomfortably, but understood lunch hour can be a bit of a rush and have limited seating availability. The food was amazing despite the slow service and poor seating area for a group our size, but the patio area was very nice to hang out."}
{"text":"They have a lot of TV's, and a lot of events, but a lot of debauchery and somehow I keep coming back against my will.  I don't know how they get all those people in there, especially charging them a COVER to watch a college basketball game!  There is a nice little back room with a private bar for when you're feeling claustrophobic.  Also, outside patio is actually great, weather permitting.  


And I feel my review is complete with letting you know there is a secret bathroom downstairs."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, my experience at this place was awful. Went down with one of my buddies to watch the game. That was a horrible mistake. I felt like I was on a episode of bar rescue. We walked in and sat there for almost 10 minutes before a waitress even came over. All of the girls were at the corner of the bar doing shots with customers, which I don't care. But atleast come over when you are done then they were all looking at there phones before they came over. The draft beer was horrible. I ordered a sam adams summer ale. The foam hat was about 80% of  the glass and she just kept letting it pour over the sides and filling it. Didn't even taste like summer ale.. FIX YOUR LINES.  The only positive was tgere are tvs at every angle.. stayed till i finished my horrible beer and left. Stay away."}
{"text":"Hung out on the patio on a saturday afternoon.  Service was good.
Waitress was very nice and accommodating.  Super friendly!

Ordered wings - they were excellent. Waffle fries are good, not greasy at all! or over salted!! 

Lots of beer choices on tap.  Atmosphere inside is laid back, decently cool. A lot of toom and there is a skylight room in the back.

Best part - it is not overly priced for the area."}
{"text":"Employees assaulted people and the ownership called people who are supporting Alissa Violet cowards. VERY unprofessional. Honestly fucked up. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS U WANNA GET BEAT UP AND GET CALLED A COWARD!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the buffalo  mac and cheese pizza. Besides that, the staff was incredibly rude. One of the staff made a racist comment to me. I asked for his name and he refused to tell me. When I tried to point him out to a another person, I was dismissed and told to take it up with the manager. I asked for the manager and a manager never came. I doubt anybody told any manager about the incident. I just ask you train your staff better. Making jokes about my culture is not okay. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Dogfish 90 minute IPA saved this place. Terrible service, terrible food. Come for alcohol only."}
{"text":"I have never experienced bottle service with 8 bottles purchased as such an inconvenience to a business as I have today. I love Cleveland but its integrity means more to me than a single businesses need to keep up with the \"jones\" in the most hypothetical way as it has.

Let's all just come to a compromise that barley house is no good to anyone other  than those who have experienced it 's \"convince.\" If you have signed the bill you might as well as have unsigned bottle service with An expiration date dated way too soon. They are ready and willing for you to be out of the vacinity and to bring unpaid guests into the mix bc they might be high school friends... I had high hopes... But u realized that the high school blood line is more convenient than anything else. Cheers to  those with a bad experience and hail to those trying to make a better experience to those involved."}
{"text":"Well...it's a Tuesday and boring. Don't ask busy bartenders for local tips. Drinks are decent, don't order from the menus. Not worth the up charge. Everyone was chill, hip hop music. Okay for mixed drinks on a weekday."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this for their dance club atmosphere. I avoid eating at places like this because there are so many amazing chefs in Cleveland that bar food rarely becomes an option.
For the dancing though, this is always one of the most packed places. You can expect it to be wall to wall full of people, and you are trying to squeeze your way around. Sometimes it's not that bad, but that would probably depend a lot on the weather.  If there is a huge line to get in and it doesn't appear like they are letting anyone in, then they are really packed in here. However, if you're a girl, the bouncer told me that girls don't have to wait. So they do give you priority to get in, so you can try to walk right up to the bouncer to get in.
The dance floor isn't very big, and you get bumped into a lot while you're dancing. I usually see a lot of guys coming here, and they like to go on the stage in groups to dance and scope out their prey.
They do have a VIP section in the back that isn't too crowded and has a private bar, so you can get your drinks much quicker.
Overall, it's a good stop if you're club hopping!"}
{"text":"So, we decided to (against our better judgement) pay for a VIP table/bottle service at Barley House for the night. We were celebrating a few birthdays, so we figured it would be great to have our own elevated section to dance and drink. When we arrived I realized that our makeshift \"VIP table\" was a pub table with 4 chairs just off the main dance floor where everyone could just walk off the floor and take as much of our expense liquor and beer as they pleased. It was honestly the worst experience I have ever had paying that much money for the \"VIP experience.\" There was no way to distinguish who was in VIP (no wristbands), and random people were just walking over taking drinks and beer as the pleased while the bouncer was taking selfies with the drunk girls at the table next to us. On top of all that, a random person (not VIP) came off the dance floor and started a fight with our party. I can't believe they would just not tell us that all of the tables were full and we would have booked somewhere else. Instead they decided it was a good idea to make us pay $200 a bottle while shoved in a corner (in front of the exit doors which was most definitely fire code violation). There is a reason all the other tables are elevated and separated from the main dance floor. To all of my friends that buy tables on the regular, I will be recommending that they should not spend the money here. However, it is worth noting that our server was great and helped us despite being pushed around like everyone else at the table."}
{"text":"I was up in Cleveland this past weekend for a friend's birthday, and it also happened to be St. Pat's in the Flat, which is just a party for OU Alumni at Barley House and not actually in the flats. I think this is my second or third time going, and it's always a good time seeing people, but Barley House is just not a great venue for something getting so big. I've been to Barley House quite a few times besides this, and it's always wayyy too crowded and impossible to move around without pissing someone off.

It's pretty similar to any other broed out bar you'd find in [insert city here], which is fine with me as long as people aren't assholes, which doesn't usually end up being the case. The St. Pats event is not as bad, since most people share a somewhat common bond, and the drinks are fairly cheap, but it's definitely not usually the case in my experience.

I've stopped by for lunch, and the food wasn't that bad, and it's definitely not crowded at all, but there didn't really seem to be any point of going during lunch when there's lots of other great food around the area. 

If you find yourself on West 6th in Cleveland, I'd probably avoid stopping in here mainly because you're going to have a hard time getting a drink, and it will be shoulder-to-shoulder. If you're from Columbus, think Callahan's mixed with Bernard's or Bar 23. There's lots of other bars on the street to check out, and you'll probably have a much more comfortable Saturday night."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Barley house, I look around and think - what a nice bar this is!  Then I look around a little more and I realize that the decor is one of the only things going for it.  It's very clubby and even when they're hosting specific parties (ahem, St. Pats in the Flats /OU Alumni), it ends up being packed and gross.  Some of us may have wanted to watch a game, but instead we're hearing Katy Perry songs blasting to the point where you have to yell.  

On top of that, the bartenders wouldn't let me put drinks on my boyfriends tab.  Umm...no, I won't make him come down here, and yes, I will be leaving now...with him...thank you very much."}
{"text":"I've been to barley quite a bit now, when it's packed and when it's slow. As I'm writing this I can't recall having any negative experiences. I've concluded that BH is a guarantee for me. There have been times that I've hopped around W6th and Barley is always where I end up at. Come to think of it, all of my single friends love Barley. And why not? Barley is awesome! Their bartenders and servers are beautiful, and on top of their game. Barley sets their bar up perfectly for high volume, I've never waited more than a minute to order. They have a new new bar in the back called the grotto. Pretty cool. You can smoke and stay warm, and never go outside.

The music here is pretty good. Most rap and edm. They get djs frequently some you have to buy tix for. Beyond that they host a decent amount of events, some are all you can eat/drink. Food is pretty good. So keep a heads up for those they are a great time. Just about any given weekend you will find Cleveland's players in there buying bottles kinda cool to meet them. 

Barley IMO is the one of the better places to meet new people. Go ready to have fun. I'll see you there."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hang out and they usually have a live band on the weekend.  However, it seems weird to me that they then turn into a \"dance club\" at around 10pm?  I don't know, I just think they shouldn't try to be everything?

The food here is pretty good - I don't think this location has the same menu as the one in Akron.  The Akron location has the most amazing pita nachos - I ordered them here but they weren't the same and not nearly as delish.  I have tried their pizzas and they were pretty good.  

Another weird thing, if they still do it, is that the tables outside and some inside turn into bottle service only after a certain time???  Again, stop trying to be everything to everyone.  You are Barley House.  In Cleveland. Not some fancy place in NY or LA with high rollers!!"}
