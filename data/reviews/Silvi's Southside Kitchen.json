{"text":"I was very excited about visiting Silvi's after reading some good reviews.  I love Mexican food and am always trying to experience new places that have positive buzz.    I have to say I was disappointed by Silvi's. I admit that they are known for the tacos, and maybe I should have ordered them, but I found the food a bit bland and not special. The chips and salsa were good, although not complimentary, and the chips are nice and fluffy. I tried the pork with salsa verde and the beef with red sauce.  Both meats were well-cooked and tender, but the sauces were lacking spice or tang. The pinto beans (not refried) had a nice smoky taste, but when you expect the meats to stand out, it's not that exciting.   We did, however, try the flan, which was nicely presented and very delicious.  I'm not sure if they made it in store as the waitress made a comment about \"I saw it the other day\", but I could be mistaken.   The service was friendly and the prices were reasonable.  I doubt they'll get a liquor license anytime soon, so you have to bring your own bottle."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious! We started with the tortilla chips (which were warm, just made) and salsa, which was a wonderful thing to munch on while we were waiting for our appetizer to come out. For the appetizer, we had the cheese wedges, which were the perfect blend of crunch and spice. The breading was delicious, and provided a great shell for the melty pepperjack cheese inside. Silvi's Big Burrito (I think that's what it was called) was SO delicious, and just as good the next day! My mom had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, which she raved about. For dessert we tried the Choco-Flan, which was the perfect end to the meal. All of the food was very fresh and tasted home-cooked. I highly recommend Silvi's Southside Kitchen and will make it a point to eat there every time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience!  We didn't know what to expect and we ended up super happy with our overall experience at Silvi's.    Aesthetically speaking, it is not your typical Mexican themed or classy looking establishment.  Sometimes I think these places are better though as they focus on the right things... The food and the service.  We were greeted immediately upon walking in, and it was a genuine greeting.  Upon sitting down we were given menus and wine glasses for our wine that we brought (since its BYOB).  Our water glasses were never empty either... They always filled it up when they were getting low and we never had to ask for more.   Since we had not been here before- we wanted a sampling of things.  We got the Fried Cheese Wedges (amazing and not traditional- they were pepper jack cheese with a tortilla crusting), chips and salsa (thin and airy and fresh, and the salsa had some spice but was not overtly hot), and the deep fried pickles (yummo, their ranch was great too).  I got the Beef Sopes - great quality beef it seemed.  My hubby got pork and chicken tacos and he said they were great.    The service here was great and it will indeed make us go back.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Silvi's has Mexican and Southwestern and burgers on the menu.  Waiter told us that most items are homemade including soups, chili, salsa's and tortilla's.  Also, the owner/chef is from Texas and wife is Mexican.     Chose a Creamy Corn/Poblano soup that was delicious.  Thick with nice flavors, still green poblano so not hot, just a nice flavoring.  The chips were good and the mild salsa was really tasty but spicier than expected for a mild.   The pork taco was good with a tasty corn tortilla.  The pork was not very flavorful and probably a little overcooked, but the toppings and salsa were very tasty.  The place is small and very casual.  Would expect a bigger crowd especially on weekends, once the Southside crew learn about Silvi's."}
