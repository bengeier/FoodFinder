{"text":"Love the concept, I really do! They had 2 for 1 cat visit deal so it was perfect reason to finally check this place out. However 90% of the kittens were hiding or sleeping so we barely got to play with them. I would truly be happy and satisfied to just sit and relax at the cafe area and awe those cuties from the glass wall while sippin on my tea! I did enjoy their tea called Calico and will come back for that! But I won't be spending extra for the cat visits."}
{"text":"Didn't like it at all. Twenty bucks just to walk in the door and then another 17 for horrible snacks while we wait to go in and see the cats. There were only two cats that were actually moving in the whole place and too many people so you can even spend time with them. Wouldn't return I could go to the SPCA and have more fun than I did at the Cat Cafe"}
{"text":"Such a neat idea and place!

We came on a rainy Monday morning about two weeks after they opened and it was fairly quiet.

We came for the 9-9:45 slot and were pleasantly surprised by the selection of wonderfully delicious food and beverage options!!! It was hard to decide what to have as all the cupcakes, cookies, cake pops, muffins and scones looked absolutely delicious! They have alternative milk options as well if you choose to opt for other milk, which is nice as there are many people who cant have milk or choose not to for ethical reasons... helps keep the \"hipsters\"'coming!! Haha

They also have really cute merchandise from local artists and sellers which is really nice! We were suckered into buying coffee and tea that had really cute pictures of cats on them!!! 

The actual cat part is wonderful! It is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, clean, comfortable and filled with lovely cats! We were told by the lovely \"purrista\" working at the time that the MEOW foundation specifically chooses and integrates cats that they think will get along to go to the cafe at one time, and they did a good job because there were no cat fights. They have kittens and adult cats which balance each other out nicely! They have lots of places for the cats to hide if they need some alone time to chill out. There are lots of things for the cats to interact with and even those \"wand\" toys so you can play with the cats too!! 

You get 45 minutes with the cats for $10 which is very reasonable, the price of food and beverage is also very reasonable,especially considering that they have cats to take car of, staff to pay, and expenses for the building...I have been to cat cafes that charge much more!

Of course there are still a few kinks, but of course they just opened!!!

People complaining about cats sleeping while they are visiting or not being active are ridiculous! Do you know how much cats sleep!! The staff told us that the best time to come is the first time slot and the last time slot, in the morning the cats are so happy to see people and at night they are ready to play!!

The staff are very knowledgable, friendly and happy to help you! Fantastic costumer service for sure!

I would recommend regal cat cafe to all my friends, family, strangers and the mailman!! 


***went back again this week and it was wonderful! Lots of kittens this time!"}
{"text":"It's a cool concept, and I think it's cool that Calgary has it, but they squeeze wayyyyyy too many people into one room (16 at once?!) and there is only like 9 cats; a couple of them were nowhere to be seen. It's awkward having to huddle beside so many people just to pet the sleeping cat. Obviously, this isn't something that they can help, but when the cats are just sleeping the whole time it isn't very fun. I think that for the $10 charge, a beverage should be included like other cat cafes."}
{"text":"The Regal Cat Café is such an amazing place. They collaborate with the meow foundation to find good homes for loving cats. The coffee is top notch and the staff is amazing! 
I adopted my kitty from the café and can't say enough good things about this place. Thank you for creating such a special place."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a Chai Latte the other day to check it out before I decided to meet with the kitties. Everything is cute, clean, bright and fun! I think 10.00/person is a bit much to play with cats but I understand that they need to look after the cats."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for myself and my 8 year old son since we both love cats but can't have one since my hubby is allergic. Perfect thing for us to do on a Saturday afternoon together and a treat for my son.

We arrived 10 minutes before our scheduled time (we booked online) and since we have never been there wanted to make sure we were prepared. Checked in with the girl at the front counter who wasn't overly friendly, looked annoyed and we just paid our fee. We didn't order any food or beverages since we had just had lunch before we arrived at the cafe. She let us know \"the process\" as rude as possible and we waited and looked around the cafe portion. We noticed it was 2 minutes before our scheduled time so went into the locker room to put away our jackets and things and wash our hands. At that point the girl came flying into the room yelling \"You can't be in here\" and startled myself and my son. All the other people were already out of the cat room and in the locker room listening to her lose her mind. I personally thought it was uncalled for, you would think we were criminals and stealing cats? My son got really embarrassed and hid behind me. He asked me if we could go home, which make me sad since it was already ruined for him by the obnoxious loud girl who felt she needed to scream and embarrass us. We left the locker room but left our items inside and waited outside the door. 5 seconds later we were allowed back in? Was that drama really necessary to wait a few seconds? No, not really. She could have been allot nicer about it and we didn't do anything wrong but wash our hands and hang up our coats? I'm going to assume she doesn't know how to talk with people since she did a really poor job. Not to mention, who yells at someone in front of their kid? YIKES.

When we did get into the cat room we had fun and watched some cats and played with them with their toys. I felt the people who were working in the room watched people to see if they were doing something wrong and you couldn't fully relax. If you were playing with a cat, someone would come over and start talking to you when all we wanted to do was enjoy some kitties and have a relaxing time. It was kind of like being in a car dealership and someone following you around and talking about the cars when all you want to do is look around by yourself and relax. We aren't here to adopt a cat, we are here to visit and support your business. We have spent money to be here. We just want to have a nice Saturday afternoon being with cats since we don't have that opportunity at home. This was a treat for my son and it felt like the opposite.

The place is clean, modern and a great place to spend an hour. The service can be allot better and the girl at the front counter really needs to learn how to speak with people especially people with kids. Yelling for no reason and making a scene is really un-necessary. Would I go back again, not sure since it wasn't the most enjoyable experience. My child would definitely not go back since every time someone mentions the cat café, he always mentions \"how the lady there yelled at his mom\". Not something I wanted for my kid to see or the take away I wanted for him. Its really too bad since it is a great concept and love that they help the Meow Foundation but they really need people who are allot more customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Beautifully designed space, great coffee and tea, plus sweet treats made locally! Everything about this place is in support of locally owned businesses and merchants. Such a happy environment where you get to enjoy some fuzz therapy! It is also in the heart of Kensington which is a great hip place to explore in the city. Highly recommend checking it out! 

One tip!! 

Definitely look into the website and read over how the process works. It is reservation based with only a few walk in slots so best reserve! Also keep in mind the $10 fee to see the cats is crucial for keeping this cafe running by providing the amazing space it has in Kensington and also to care for the cats for they do have needs!! Part of that also goes to the Meow Foundation which is partnered with the cafe to provide the cats. They are the rockstars tending to the fur babies in the first place so it's wonderful to know you're supporting them as well."}
{"text":"The concept is really cool. However, we all know that animals are unpredictable and have different personalities. While they do have many cats, not all of them are active at once. It felt like a zoo, with humans following around whatever cat showed any interest in playing. Reduce the reservations per hour, so everyone can get a chance to play."}
{"text":"To anyone out there who has severe cat allergies such as I do and is afraid to go here. Go here. You will be fine. Just do it. 
I have such bad cat allergies that when I enter a place that has just 1 cat - I know immediately because my nose will start running and I will be sneezing. Don't even get me started on the fact if I touch my eyes it's game over so I thought how on earth am j going to be able to go to a place with 15 cats in a room?? But I had to go because I love cats so much even though I'm allergic. 
Before going I ate treats and drank tea because I knew after I went in there I would want to leave right after. Everything is cat themeed and they stick to the theme so well. We had cat macaroons in the flavours of cotton candy, earl grey and salted caramel. My hot chocolate came with a cat paw print on it. They have cat pillows. Cat mugs. Cat shirts. Cat everything. I wanted to buy it all. 
Then I decided to go into the cat room and ... I was fine!!!! It is so so clean in there that there was not a problem. 
So if your allergic to cats- go and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"My review is based entirely on the surroundings, ambience and product offerings but unfortunately not the food or beverages. I had just come from breakfast down the street and was full so I did not order anything but I wanted to check out this neat new addition to Kensington.  The space is really open and bright.  It is very welcoming right from the front door and there is a lot of glass out to the street and between the cat room and the rest of the cafe.  The cafe side has a good number of tables and chairs and a tall bench to sit at and look directly into the cat room.  The cafe side has a number of retail items all in the cat theme.  We picked up a great pillow that says \"THIS PILLOW IS PROBABLY COVERED IN CAT HAIR\".  For the cat room itself you need to reserve your time and pay a fee that goes to support the Meow Foundation.  This is a wonderful no skill shelter that helps find furever homes for lots of cats and kittens every year.  Both of our cats are Meow alumni so the organization holds a special place in my heart.  Will definitely be back hopefully to get into the cat room and to partake of some of those yummy macaroons and a coffee!"}
{"text":"They act like the cats are endangered species. Charge you to go into a separate room with the cats, then follow you around like you're going to poke their eyes out. 
Drinks & food were mediocre."}
{"text":"Expensive and not even a discount for my one year old baby.  Literally just turned one and was charged $10.  I'm all for supporting the meow foundation, but seems a little much considering. I didn't even want to purchase a coffee as I was afraid what that would cost me. The experience is not worth it if you have animals at home. This is good for someone who has never been around cats or for someone who is scared of animals."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it here! The food was absolutely adorable and cat themed, the employees were so kind and friendly and they went out of their way to get to know me/make me comfortable! 

The cats were all super friendly and cuddly and most importantly they were comfortable and not stressed out! This cafe is such an awesome place as it helps cats find homes and is an awesome experience:) strongly suggest going'"}
{"text":"This cafe is wonderfully designed, with the careful consideration of the kitties kept in mind. It is absolutely amazing how all of their merchandise supports local vendors and artists. Everything about this cafe supports local, which makes it that much more ameowzing! 

Cats do get sleepy, and do things on their own terms. Which is COMPLETELY understandable because they are CATS! You can't go in expecting every single cat to put on their crazy playful side every darn second. That's unrealistic and simply selfish to think as such. The cats are absolutely amazing to spend time with, to relieve stress and just get some pure comfort and fuzz therapy. Not to mention, all of them are rescues that come from the local MEOW foundation. Even a portion of all sales goes back to support this amazing foundation, which is really neat! 

In all honestly, the prices are extremely comparable to those other places in Kensington. It's overall a clean, modern, cute and purrfect place to spend an hour or two! Would recommend it to absolutely anyone.  =^.^="}
{"text":"I love this place so much! They have great coffee and snacks! A great boutique that features many local artists and CATS! Who doesn't love petting (and maybe adopting CATS!) Just remember if you plan on coming here male sure to make a reservation so you can guarantee a spot to hang out with the felines."}
{"text":"It's a great idea and a cute set up. But the reservation system needs a complete overhaul. Too many people packed into one time slot is too much for the cats and they slew and hide. As a result $10 a head is too much to not get to do anything with the cats."}
{"text":"For those who aren't familiar, cat cafes have been around for many years in Asia and have made their way to North America in recent years. We have been to many cat cafes in Korea and Japan and was hoping this was similar. The cat room was really cool, with ladders, bridges and hidden nooks for kitties to explore. But it seems too much emphasis has been placed on the \"cat\" and not enough attention on the \"cafe\"part. I My coffee drink was overly sweet and had a strange aftertaste, and I didn't care for the glutten-free snacks that tasted like styrofoam. I like the concept; this places focuses on finding homes for shelter cats. But I can't see myself going back to this place unless I was in the market for a new cat."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? This is the only way I can get my fill of kitten cuddles as some of my family members are not cat enthusiasts. They take great care of the kitties as they make their progression to their forever homes. 
Haven't had anything other than the macarons but, they are the best I've ever had and Oh! so cute with their little cats faces!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe with even cuter kitties! We didn't eat or drink anything but all their pastries were cat related! I would recommend making a reservation before you come in. A majority of the kitties were already adopted which was great to see! In the play room they have information about all the cats. The cafe was super clean and all the cats were very sweet and playful! I highly recommend if you are a true cat lover!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I absolutely love the concept and vibe here. The staff are friendly and meow foundation is a fantastic organization (I got my cats from them before Regal Cat Café was open).The cats are adorable and it's a beautiful space, with adorable things to purchase too. Some of the cats are playful, others are sleepy, that's just the nature of cats, and I think it depends a lot on the time of day you go. My personal favourite time of day to go is in the evening where the cats are naturally more active, and it seems to be a bit more relaxed.

I think ten dollars per visit is completely reasonable to pay for a visit, but I have visited other cat cafes that are set up as pay by donation (minimum $5) or purchase of a drink/food item to reduce people's expectations of the cats. They are rescues after all, they aren't all social or wanting to be overstimulated all day, which I'm not sure everyone who visits understands. I understand because it's so new and popular why the structure is in place, but I hope as it becomes more established some modifications/flexibility can be introduced."}
