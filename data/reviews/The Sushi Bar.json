{"text":"The Sushi Bar: a bit of a generic name but definitely not a generic taste. I've gone a few times and sushi chef Dr. Jimi has never disappointed. The sushi is always fresh and the service is always pleasant. A nice variety of sushi and noodles to choose from, including a few organic options. It's a very pleasant and inviting atmosphere, and if you look at all the photos on the walls, you'll feel a strong sense of community and what The Sushi Bar represents. Lunch or dinner, The Sushi Bar is always the right choice. If you don't have time to sit in, grab some take-out instead. Definitely try to salmon tartare or Black Dragon Roll. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable udon meal - are with a bowl of salad and spicy tuna maki (6 small pieces). I also shared a plate of spicy salmon pizza with my friend. Price - $18 tip and tax in. Pizza was tasty but a little expensive. Salad and maki were generic in flavour and appearance. Udon was less than desirable and contained very little vegetables. 

Overall - only 3 stars compared to restaurants in this location (Yonge and Lawrence)."}
{"text":"This was the second time i've been in to what is a relatively new place, but the first time that i went with the family. We have a 5yo. that seems to hoover up everything that is placed in front of him, but it is sushi and he is 5!!! So we went for fathers day, with a little trepidation anyways. The small plates on the conveyer belt were one of the biggest hits, all for the novelty factor. The sushi was star tho, as he tried, nigiri, gyoza, springrolls, rolls, and tempura(prawns,yams and octopus). oddly enough the only thing that he didn't like was the texture of the mango on one roll. The food impressed both my wife and i, and we didn't touch the menu. So i think we'll be even happier when we do, as i feel most sushiboats are the lower end of quality. The interior is impressive due to its location in a stripmall between a Macca's and a liquor store, and the staff were all pleasant, friendly and helpful. All in all this is a place i would go out of my way to get to, it just so happens that it's just down the road from home. we will all be back."}
{"text":"Oh No!  We will never come back to this place!
Their food was extremely bad! 
My friend and I orderd Tendon from regular menu. The Tendon sucked!  Only 3 small shrimps and Tenkasu(crunchy deep-fried tempura dough) were on small amount of rice. No miso soup came together. Wait!  Tenkasu on rice?  No way!  Real Tendon comes with big shrimp tempura( of course) and some vegetable tempuras on rice!  Also, the shrimp tempura was obviously from frozen! It was totally different food from real \"Tendon\"!  The taste was awful!  

I was so surprised when I found many yelp user rated this place 5 stars. This place does not deserve even 2 stars!  
I saw a lady working at sushi counter dealing with sushi with long pink manicured nail!  It is unbelievable! a head chef or restaurant owner allow anyone who handles food to have long nail? No way!  I will never ever come back to this place!"}
{"text":"Gone there twice. We had sashimi platter, clams and their awesome sushi pizzas with sake. One of the best sushi places! Will go back again."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Once our family of four walked thru the doors, we were greeted with a clean, sophisticated atmosphere. Some great jazz was playing, and our host was very accommodating without being annoying. Our nine year old son isn't a fan of Sushi, but after tasting some tempura we might make him a believer! Great kids menu that had more than enough to satisfy (and beyond!) his taste buds. We ordered off the menu from a wide range of choices. Whilst we were waiting, our host gave us some tasters from the chefs. Right away we were hooked and were drooling for more. Had a great beer, sorry forgot the name, and my wife had a tea. Not a tea in a thimble like most places, but an actual adult size mug!

After dinner I wanted more, but my stomach was giving instructions for my brain to stop. Some of the best sushi in Calgary, definitely will be going again. Forget places like Edo which is in the strip mall behind it, that stuff is like tasting cardboard after eating here."}
{"text":"They moved their location about 3 doors down but it still doesn't change my rating. This is the only place I come to for sushi. I hated just looking at a sushi roll and gagging but it all changed when I tried their salmon teriyaki rolls. 
AMAZING taste. I also love their vegetable fried udon and tempura dragon rolls. 
Prices are reasonable and the staff are very friendly and polite. Sometimes they do some special orders not on the menu for regulars. 
Will definately keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife on a weeknight for dinner recently.  We are 30 something professionals.  Had some sushi and sashimi along with tempura don, salmon tartare, a couple of the dinner special items, and one of the special rolls.  Service was good and the chef was sociable with the patrons. No issues there.  But the food itself was very subpar with regards to taste and quality. The sushi and sashimi did not seem fresh. The tempura shrimp was soggy and felt like it had either been made earlier in the day or microwaved.  They used the same generic ponzu sauce on a couple of the dishes.  

As I said I have no issue with the ambience, service, or pricing. But the food itself was subpar.  Certainly not worth the 4 or 5 stars most reviewers have given it.  I noticed most of the other reviews commented on how nice and sociable the chef is.  How they like interacting with him. But bottom line is the food has to be good, which it was not. There are many other sushi places in the area you would be better off spending our money on.  It was bad enough that I felt compelled to write a review on Yelp - for the first time. Don't be fooled by the other reviews."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Yelp led me to Sushi Bar. It's hard to find a sushi place open on a Sunday before 5pm, especially in the suburbs. 
It was a bitter cold day, so we were the only ones in the tiny restaurant, but I can imagine once people start coming, they will return repeatedly. 
To start, our sever was fantastic. She explained all the dishes and made sure to answer any questions we had. 
The menu is quite large and have a great selection of rolls, sashimi, apps and hand cones. I have never seen such an extensive list of hand cones with unique fillings. 
The menu colour coded for pricing. A great way for those on a budget. I could not believe how cheap it was for such quality food. Everything was fresh, nicely plated and the rice was perfectly cooked.We ate like pigs. The bill came to $50 for the two of us.
They have a great mid day deal. for 13.00 you can get a choice of three items on their lunch menu list, plus soup, salad and rice. How can that be beat? 
I cannot wait to return and try out everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Being a regular for years, their a la carte sushi are cut to thick pieces, and are consistently high quality. Must try the scallops, you won't be disappointed. Waitresses are super friendly, a pleasant place to dine in. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great sushi, great workers great environment and a great system and its really cheap! I finally found a place that has takoyaki in calgary. Strongly recommended Sushi Bar. Friggin' Love it :)"}
{"text":"This place... Really bad... Really bad... Sashimi tasted so fishy and sickening. I think they tried to cover it by putting tons of wasabi! Crazy. I paid 45$ for garbage sushi and sashimi. The rice wasn't even done properly. 

Seriously, with all the sushi place in Toronto, you can't survive if you serve this kind of shot quality. Plus, they don't even have a liquor license! Lol 

Just don't go here. Don't waste your money or your time. They truly messed up my palate. I had to go other truly good sushi restaurant to restore my taste."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends it was my first time here. 
They offer many kinds of authentics Japanese food with awesome price.

Friendly and good service."}
{"text":"Being regulars at Shinobu down the street, we recently began going to the Sushi Bar whenever we aren't able to get a reservation Shinobu. While the Sushi Bar does not offer dishes on the same level of authenticity as Shinobu, it has its own strengths. The ambience is definitely much better as they had recently relocated and the tables are a comfortable distance apart instead of being very cramped, as there old location was. It's a very comfortable place to have a quick dinner date or also to go out for dinner and drinks with a group of friends - we've done both and were very pleased on both occasions. While I was disappointed that they don't offer a \"deluxe\" nigiri set (think scallop, uni, hamachi, etc) most of the items we've tried have been quite good and if you really want the premium types, you always have the option of ordering them a la carte. The service is also great as the waitresses are very friendly. On more than one occasion we were also offered specialty items as well as dessert on the house which were greatly appreciated. One thing to note, their mochi dessert is simply the kind you can purchase in packages of 6 or 8 at your local Asian supermarket but they do a good job of making sure they aren't frosty or overly frozen when served (not always the case at many sushi restaurants)."}
{"text":"We were traveling in the area and just stopped in. Boy, were we glad we did. The sushi was fresh and the udon noodles were just as they fix them in Japan. My coworker, who is Japanese by the way, said that the food was just like eating in Japan. I would have given it 5 stars if we could have drank a beer with dinner, but if you're not looking for alcohol than this is about as good as it gets when it comes to traditional Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I don't think The Sushi Bar is as exceptional as everyone is saying, but it's alright. The service is great, which is a big deal for me. The servers are attentive and the chef is friendly. 

The sushi isn't perfect. It tastes fresh, but the maki rolls aren't all uniform size when you get them (in my experience, at least) which makes it difficult for small-mouthed people to really enjoy the sushi. The miso soup is among the best I've ever had. 

They also sell sushi-making supplies and some Japanese food & drink, which is cool."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Lovely Japanese decor with anime playing on the big screen. 
Service excellent so friendly. 
New location is nice but I hope the varnish smell subsides soon. 

Try the sashimi. Yum"}
{"text":"Not a very good experience here with the food, although service was excellent. I tried tobiko yuzu sushi, grilled black cod, cold soba, and onigiri.

The yuzu taste was a bit overpowering, but interesting and different. The grilled black cod was tasty, but had two small bones in it, which can happen, but really shouldn't. The soba was a mess, a bunch of soggy noodles in a bowl with the sauce already added, and very mushy tofu cubes.

Finally, the onigiri was a do-it-yourself effort, as I was presented with a rice triangle on top of a sheet of nori with some spicy tuna on top.

Underwhelming for the price paid, won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is great; therefore, it's a shame I won't be going back. The chef was unbelievably rude. He was obnoxiously swearing, not particularly at anyone, but swearing loudly nonetheless. When I asked my waiter for a couple extra slices of avocado for my 9 month old baby the chef began yelling at the waiter saying, \"who's going to pay for that? It's not coming out of my pocket! How am I suppose to charge for that? Charge them a dollar!\" I would like to point out that I expected to be charged for the extra avocado, I just didn't expect anyone to be yelled at in front of the whole restaurant. To be honest, I wish I hadn't finished the food we ordered. I wish we would have walked out. 

If I had any recommendations for the Sushi Bar, it would be these:

1. Treat you staff with respect.
2. Don't swear where your customers can hear you, even if you're not swearing at anyone.
3. Train your staff how to handle customer requests, especially for food that isn't on the menu. For example, if I want to ask for extra avocado, I want to have it brought out and be charged for it OR I want the waiter to inform me he can only serve what's on the menu. 

For exceptional customer service I would recommend Globefish Sushi.

For amazing sushi that won't hurt your wallet I would recommend Itoko Sushi in Chaparral."}
{"text":"Not overly expensive - the way the menu is laid out it is really easy to keep track of the cost while going through the dishes. 
Not the best sushi - maybe it was because I was there on a Tuesday, but we were the only people in the restaurant (6pm). More started to show as the evening progressed (it was pretty slow) so maybe this is more of an evening place. We didn't get any of the \"tasters\" the other reviewers talked about - but we hadn't read the reviews before we went so we didn't plan on getting any either.
My sister has been here a ton and loves the place. For me it wasn't anything special, Actually it was a little disappointing. 


The interior looks straight out of a makeover show. Everything is new, clean, and sleek when you walk through. While you're waiting for your food though (and trust me, you'll have time) you can't help but see that some of the areas are starting to fall apart already. A quick patch - even with some glue - would take care of the problem. This was my first time going, so it may be that the slats had just come loose right before opening and the restaurant looked really really clean so I haven't dinged any stars because of that. 

The sushi itself is either on the bland side or waay over done. Sauces and garnish either abounds the plate or is totally non existent. 

Will I go back? Probably, but not until I've given some of the other sushi places around here another test run.

Oh - and no drink menu makes it really difficult to order anything they may be promoting or have on special. Actually it makes it hard to order anything at all..."}
{"text":"This place is great. They are very accommodating to our vegetarian needs (though we have had the odd dynamite roll here, and they're delicious). I can't recommend based on the actual sushi, but based on what we've had, and the excellent service, I give this place two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Food quality was not good. And really poor service. The server was not helpful. The sushi's tasted bland."}
{"text":"New location is simple but decent. Had the salmon tartare, some sushi and sashimi. The salmon tartare was good and all other food ordered was decent. Pricing is very strange. Some items such as the rolls are very reasonable while other items are quite overpriced. You can order a 15 piece sashimi platter for 18 bucks or a la carte for 6 bucks per 2 pcs. Service was excellent. Very cheerful, helpful and polite staff."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi price is good to love it been to lots of sushi places in the city this is my favorite and is also the best tasting love love love this place can't say enough how good it is"}
{"text":"Feel this place is definitely over rated. I was just around the area and wanted to try some Japanese food in this area. Came in with high expectation based on the reviews. However the food was not good. smallest black dragon roll I have ever seen and was too salty. Over priced sashimi platter -.- not coming back again. Not even a 3 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here a few time. Best service I had as waitresses are all super friendly and will go out of their way to ensure you enjoy your meal. Sushi pizza is highly recommend as they are pan fried in stead of deep fried. Sushi and rolls are good! Generally a very nice and cozy place."}
{"text":"this place is terrible!! my friend and i decided to try this place out because of the good ratings but the food left me questioning why the ratings are so high. 

The miso soup and the clams were ridiculously salty. We had to ask them to change the clams because it was so salty to a point that we couldn't eat it. The waitress came back with another bowl of clams that she claimed there was no salt added. WRONG! it was STILL very salty! The black dragon roll and this cucumber dish were below average. This is by far the worst japanese restaurant I've been to in toronto. I'm very disappointed... especially for the price they charge, i expected much better.  Although the quality of the food was poor, the service was alright. They apologized politely and asked us if we wanted ice cream."}
{"text":"I obviously didn't enjoy this place as much as everyone else. I think three stars may even be a stretch - just another average Japanese restaurant in my opinion.

I had a Sushi combo special for 24.99. The salad and Miso soup starters were standard. The Chicken skewers (3) were just terrible - all fat and grizzle, yuck. The best way to describe the sushi is \"OK\". I was not a big fan of the sushi rice, way to much rice vinegar. The fish was fresh but the final result falls well short of Toronto's best. My combo at $24.99 was not worth it at all.

I must admit the service was definitely above average. Our server was fast, efficient and very polite.

I also liked the Japanese style decor, very comfortable and the restaurant is large enough that it doesn't feel overly crowded.

I can get far better sushi elsewhere in the city (and I suggest you do as well). Really disappointed given all stellar the reviews.

BK"}
{"text":"I really like good quality sushi, so I've been trying to scout out all the good sushi places around my neighbourhood! We ordered the sakura sushi platter (35pc) and several stand alone dishes. The quality of fish on the platter varied:

Salmon: above average
Tuna: not good, did not taste fresh
Butter fish: good
White tuna: average
Shrimp: good

The cali, spicy salmon, and rainbow rolls were good. Though these rolls are not traditionally japanese, I still enjoy them greatly!

We also got an unagi onigiri and unagi (eel) sushi a la carte. The unagi was good. A bit salty, but the texture of the meat was better than I expected.

The sushi pizza was a last minute addition made on impulse. I thought it would be similar to the sushi pizzas (not so great) at ayce sushi joints. However, the sushi pizza here surprised me. The crunchy rice used to make the \"pizza\" was a nice complement to the spicy mayo fish roe \"toppings\".

The decor and service were good. The servers were attentive and came around often to fill our glasses and ask if we were doing okay.

In light of the other facors, I will give them the benefit of the doubt on some of their fish qualities. Hopefully they will have better tuna when I visit again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times (always for lunch).  The sushi is fresh, delicious, and the staff very friendly.  The one and only thing I am not a fan of is their sushi pizza - they advertise that the rice \"pizza\" is pan-fried as opposed to deep-fried like most sushi places.  Well...that may be healthier but I do not enjoy the taste.  (not that it's bad, just not comparable to the taste of sushi pizza to which I have become accustomed)."}
{"text":"Recommeded by friends who clearly don't have experience with good sushi. This place is WAAAAY overpriced for the level of quality on offer...they are charging Nami or JaBistro prices for HoSu level sushi. I just spent $50 on a supremely mediocre meal. There is NO way this is a $$ place, no way you get out of here for under $40 a person."}
{"text":"Good service and great food! Best sushi pizza you will find! They are not deep fried and I really really liked it!"}
{"text":"Sushi Bar is hands down my favourite sushi place right now. If you follow my profile you'll know I eat and review Japanese food a lot. This is the place I compare them all to. The sushi is well portioned and reasonably priced for the quality you get. 

The staff are the absolute best. Incredibly courteous and friendly and they remember me every time even though I don't come here that often (once a month?). They give me complimentary appetizers and have comped my ice cream. I make sure to tip them as well as I can.

Dr. Sushi knows his stuff and I don't even scrape out the wasabi under the fish at this place since he portions it just right to complement the taste of the fish. My favourite is mackerel (saba) but the other fish and daily specials are great too."}
{"text":"Went there with the gf a few times.
The sushi and their special dishes all taste so good! Its freshness hard to find here in Toronto.
The chef Jimi is such a nice guy too. Its always a pleasure to go there!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sushi place in Toronto. Not cheap, but the quality of the sushi is far beyond the stuff you get in most sushi restaurants. Real Japanese Sushi. High quality fish.

The chef and his staff are all really cool and friendly.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Found \"The Sushi Bar\" on Yonge north of Lawrence by accident, but the sushi here is excellent. It appears to be Japanese owned and the sushi chef offers very generous size fresh pieces of fish. I had the Chirashi which was delicious and I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Really delicious sushi.   Service is good and fish is always fresh."}
{"text":"This is hands-down one of the best sushi/maki places in the city.  And I will tell you why. I love the taste and texture of the rice, the perfect degree of tightness of the rolls, the freshness of the seafood and the amazing service. The atmosphere is also quite lovely--Dr. Jimmy, sushi master, built most of the furniture himself and puts a lot of care into his craft. 

Some sushi places make their rice overly sweet, vinegary, or compact, which is not the case with Sushi Bar. It is subtly vinegary, extremely fluffy and has the perfect texture as it enters your mouth. 

I used to come here once a week for 2 years (this was 3 years ago) and I just went back two days ago and the excellent taste and service is still the same. I have NEVER had a single roll or piece of sushi here after which I thought, \"this might be just a little fishy\" which happens often with other sushi places, but not at Sushi bar. 

My favourites happen to be the banzai roll and bc roll, which is butterfish and white tuna. The mix of ingredients is just heavenly and the avocado is perfectly ripe. I also enjoy the tuna tartare. Every time I take a bite out of their food, I think I am in heaven."}
{"text":"The food was so fresh and delicious !! Stuff welcomed us with big hello !! Music makes you feel like you are in Asia .. Definitely 5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"Can I just start by saying... the Salmon Sushi Pizza I had at this restaurant is, by far, the best thing I've ever stuck in my mouth. I seriously just had to take a moment and enjoy the experience. No other Salmon Sushi Pizza will ever be able to compete with this one. Fab-u-lous! Definitely a 'must try'.

For my main dish, I order a Red Dragon roll... not on the menu, but they accommodated my request regardless. Thank you. This again, was like no other I've had before. The salmon covering the roll was the same thickness of the 'a-la-carte' salmon sashimi I typically receive at other restaurants.

The 'a-la-carte' salmon sashimi I ordered to accompany my lunch did not disappoint either. I don't know anything about how sushi is supposed to be cut but I can tell you this, I much prefer this chef's technique over that of others.

My friend ordered the Sashimi Salad which looked absolutely beautiful. Presentation is such an important part of the overall experience and this restaurant nailed it!

I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying more dishes!

NB: It's quite a small place so reservations would be advisable."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh.  The pieces were big.  The food was really good.  Salmon tartare was tasty with the tempura bits.  Nice presentation.  Torch the salmon sushi it was perfect.  It gives it a different taste to the salmon.  Really nice place with a relaxing atmosphere.  Prices are not expensive for what you are getting.  Waitress was welcoming.  Chirashi was good but I had better before.  You do get a lot of pieces.  Salmon dragon roll was really good too and there was 8 pieces to the roll.  Even got complimentary ice cream.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend on yet another oppressively hot day in the city. The small restaurant was what I call quaint as it had all sorts of little nicnac's on the shelves. As we were seated by the delightful waitress, we noticed all the pictures of children and families alike enjoying sushi making classes with whom I presume is the chef/owner of the restaurant (Jimi?)

The menu looked good and the prices were all reasonable as well (all except the Bento combinations). We ordered the Udon lunch special, which was seasoned in a flavourful and sweet broth and had quite a bit of onions and cabbage cooked in throughout the tender noodles. This came with 3pc of spicy salmon maki (not full roll imo but it was still good value as an addition). The salad was done less traditionally but was among the better one's...mixed greens topped with radish and and chinese plum vinagrete.  

The fish was extremely succulent and fresh (notable the salmon). We ordered butterfish and avocado roll which I highly recommend for its deliciousness and LOW price as well as the Holy Roll which was surprisingly only 6pc and not quite as tasty as I expected for the price.

In total the bill came to just over $26 for the 2 of us....An amazing value for the quality. This is a definite MUST in the growing rotation of restaurants in my sushi arsenal. I recommend this place for quality at a good price."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushis and very nice service! Always got it delivered under 45mn which is not bad for sushis that great!!!"}
{"text":"I finally visited the New reno sushi bar which is 2 stores right next to.
It's bigger and better.


I had Chef's recommended sushi.
I can tell the fish is very fresh.
And the rice position is perfect for sushi.

The rice is bit dry( tasted like undercook)but I think that's the southern stylesushi  of Japan I guess.

I loveeed their miso soup.
And waitresses are very friendly:-) 

It's good for a date night and drinking.
I ll definitely going back if I m around there."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service, amazing sushi. They have expanded and now the ambience is also great."}
{"text":"They're back in business! I was driving by tonight on the way home and the open sign was on. Not sure what caused the hiatus, but happy they're back! I actually wrote the first review of this place but it says it's not a recommended review. Don't know what that means. Anyway, had the $12.99 dinner special and it's still the same great quality. Have a look at the picture. Give this place a try and hopefully they can stay open for good this time."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Sushi is amazing, prices are just as amazing. They're great with gluten, egg, milk and other allergies and substitutions. Ju and Jimmy are the best!
Jimmy is an amazing Sushi Chef."}
{"text":"They were featured in the top 10 best sushi restaurants in Toronto in a popular blog sooo i had to try it...  THE BEST SUSHI IN TOWN hands down! Everything we tried we LOVED. The tartare was amazing. The green dragon to die for and the last roll (a combo of shrimp with flambé scallops on top) was unbelievable. The staff is THE BEST. They gave us a few samples to try including a few small salads and gave my son a special treat at the end (soo he's sold for life)... I will never eat at cheapo Bloor Street sushi restaurants any more..."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the Sushi Bar, or \"Jimi's\" as me and my friend's call it, has the best sushi in Toronto. Do not let the simple name and facade fool you. This place is an inconspicuous gem. The food and service at Jimi's is exceptional and Jimi himself is a master and a gent. 

Jimi's sushi is of exceptional freshness and quality. I highly recommend the Holy Roll but you can't really go wrong with any of it. Specials like the kamikaze are very tasty. The udon is great for those days when you need a solid comfort food. I would also recommend his unique take on sushi pizza.

When my family visits from BC, this is where they go. My Japanese girlfriend ranks only her grandmother's sushi above Jimi's. I recommend Jimi's Sushi Bar without reservation."}
{"text":"This place is full of class and I have always loved the staff and the owner.  They are great with our kids too.  The sushi is fresh and beautifully presented.  I find it comforting that Jimmy always has Jiro Loves Sushi playing on the television as inspiration."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why this place has so many good reviews. That was why we chose to order from this place and it was a BIG mistake. My husband called and placed the order and we got a call back saying they had taken down his credit card number incorrectly. Then they called back a few minutes later because they needed directions to our place. 
We proceeded to get three more calls from a driver asking us where to go. The confusing thing was that he would ask, but then either carry on a conversation on another phone, or with someone who was with him, instead of listening. Then he would ask for my husband to repeat himself. This happened at least twice every call, for three calls. 

Turns out they took the address down completely wrong. Big surprise, considering their listening skills. 

We finally got our food and they had screwed up the order and given us a wrong sushi roll. Either way the sushi was among the worst we have tasted. It was a mixture of bland and salty! Basically it was terrible. 

On a side note, their dragon rolls are actually unagi rolls. Dragon rolls are called dragon rolls (at EVERY other sushi place) because they have avocado on top, making them green. It is very strange that these guys have decided that that's not the way they want to go. 

So yeah, terrible service and bad food...you can bet we won't be bothering with this place again EVER!"}
{"text":"The sushi pizza was the highlight of our meal! It's not the deep fried half assed ones you get from AYCE restaurants but it was delicately made and put together by the sushi chef! It was just so good!"}
{"text":"With a name like \"The Sushi Bar\", one might expect this little Japanese restaurant to simply just be a sushi bar. One look around the room though, and you'll quickly see that it's so much more. A wall of photos featuring everyone from young children to families serve as proof of sushi making classes. The display of Japanese groceries for sale offer new and interesting dry goods for customers to take home and try.

The piping hot brown rice tea served upon arrival at every table is something of a bonus in a city like Toronto where such a flavourful beverage would usually need to be ordered and waited for. It took a while for me to make a decision off of the well described menu, but the Boston and Salmon Tartare rolls I tried came artfully plated and were delicious.

The polite service along with the comfortable decor and fresh food make The Sushi Bar a great place to go for a quick, but good lunch."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best sushi I have had in Toronto! Jimmy the proprietor is awesome.  He will also do catering and sushi classes!   Always try the Saba (mackerel)!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Jimmy's for years. He just moved to a new, larger and nicer location a few doors down.  This is without a doubt my \"go to\" spot for great tasting, always fresh sushi in Toronto.  Heck I come up from Yorkville to Lawrence Park just to go to the Sushi Bar. Always try the Black Cod.  It literally melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since last time but my God I've missed this place. Freshiest and most flavourful sushi, sashimi, sushi pizza and amazing sake! Staff are very friendly and fun, the chef Jimmy is probably the best sushi chef in the city!"}
{"text":"When I drove by The Sushi Bar http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-sushi-bar-toronto?hrid=Smn0s558wjG12xSw7qNoTw#src:self one evening and saw a huge For Lease sign up, I just don't believe my eyes! How can my favourite Japanese place be out of business.. Then I happily realized they moved to a new location, just 3 doors down... And of course I need to come here for a visit!

This review might be a little bias as I never even ever look at the menu whenever I eat at The Sushi Bar. Just show up and sit at the sushi counter and just eat whatever served to me. 

And now I can even drink my sake here?! I just love this new location, so spacious and nicely decorated. 

There are quite a few sakes offers here and some even not on the menu. 

Chef looked at me looking at the Sake menu, he said Hot or Cold? I said Cold and the pretty waitress just shown up mysteriously with 3 sakes for me to try... Just like magic!

{"text":"I was at The Sushi Bar eating at the sushi bar on a Saturday night sushi outing! 

The Sushi Bar is just south of Shinobu which we walked by last Sunday. It is really small, has table for around 10 customers and when I got there at around 6 pm, no tables available so I was asked to sit at the sushi bar! 

The menu is quite standard.. rolls, maki, sushi, udon... They do have another special menu that is changed seasonally...which is not published online.. But tonight I have a special special menu that is the Chef's choice. 

When a single customer seated at the sushi bar asking the Chef what's good to eat? It for sure and exciting experience for both the chef and the patron. 

Miso Soup ($2) 
- A OK with tons of tofu and wakame seaweed 

Salmon Tartar ($9) 
salmon. spicy mayo with tempera bits finished with balsamic vinaigrette .Tempura bits tasted like rice krispies.. with tons of bit and texture... not soggy at all... 

Osaka Sashimi ($17) 
- salmon, butter fish, yellowtail, tuna all nice and fresh. Tuna really good cut with melt in the mouth texture 
- Special surprise are the octopus marinated in 4 different ways.. which all has their different texture, character and taste 

Baked Seafood in Shell (Chef's special) 
- big scallops, squids, crab and various seafood mixed with a lemon seasoning with light cheese on top 
- oh so yummy!! fresh seafood and prepared by one of the waitress right in front of me 

Uni and Salmon Roe Sushi (Chef's special) 
- Both so fresh and yummy. Always good to have sushi chef makes what the freshest of the day for you! 

Red Bean/Green Tea/Black Seasame Ice Cream ($3) 
- When I was deciding which one to pick, Chef said I can try them all!! Hey he really knows what a girl think! :) 

All the staffs here are so friendly and nice! I feel like I am at a private kitchen when I can talk to the chef while I am eating! They kept checking to see how I like the food and if I finish them all. I would never let any good Japanese cooking to be wasted! 

Until next time.. and since we are now on first time bases.. I can't wait to go back and try some of his Chef's offering!! 

They accepts Mastercard and Visa!"}
{"text":"This is really a overwhelming restaurant. The price is a little bit pricey regarding to the food. I ordered the seafood rice. Seafood is overcooked, and it does not match with the rice. It is like two separate dish, stir fry seafood and rice. Also, they charge extra 1 dollar with brown rice. 
The waitress  did not see we don't have napkin on our table. 
Not worth to come if driving that far.... 
Not even a place to have a quick lunch...
If the price is not good, the food must be qualified
If the food is not that good, the price must be good
That is my value for eating outside."}
{"text":"The combination of great ingediants, lovely atmosphere and friendly staff make this place a must if you find yourself looking for sushi or north on yonge!"}
