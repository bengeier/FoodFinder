{"text":"The best fried chicken and pizza in town! Family owned business, Jeff and Jimmy always know you by name and your greeted with a smile. Highly suggest to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Been my favorite since the 60's. Love their steak subs and Jo Jo's. The chicken is most excellent! They'll tell you  30 minutes but it'll be an hour! Well worth the wait. Now if they would only deliver..."}
{"text":"Yum! Now anytime I think pizza all I Will want is this! I'm so addicted to this place!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with an order of chicken and jojos and a large pizza. So delicious and the perfect dinner for a night you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"This is the worst of the fiesta places. I live across the street and I travel over to the Newton street location. Whenever I try this location I regret it and which I had taken the short drive to the better place. 

This,location is never busy and once you eat here it is clear why."}
{"text":"Fiesta is right down the street from our house and they have been our \"go to\" place for chicken dinners for quite a while.  We always pick up our orders even though they would deliver.

First of all - I LOVE JO JOS!!!  Fiesta has excellent Jo-jos!  My husband and I are dark meat fans (thighs, to be precise) and Fiesta offers several options for dinners.  They also have hot wings on the menu!  

The dinners are prepared quickly and are delicious!  The owner makes an attempt to familiarize himself with the \"regulars\" and I'm SO GLAD to have this business in our neighborhood.  We also love the pizza!

Kudos to you!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. Intend to stay away from national chain pizza places because the quality is not there and I like to switch it up. I been to pretty much every pizza place in stow, falls, Hudson area and this place is not good. I ordered a basic pepperoni pizza the sauce was bland, everything bout it was just very below average. Fiesta pizza comes nowhere close to quality that Rocco's, Lucas and even gioninos has. I will stick with those 3 it's worth the extra $. I will never be back to fiesta pizza"}
{"text":"If I could eat only one thing for the rest of my life, I would pick Fiesta sausage & onion pizza. The tiny crumbles of homemade sausage rest on and completely cover the thick layer of creamy melted provolone. The perfect sauce and a crust that is good enough to eat by itself. I've been ordering Fiesta as long as I can remember and I've never had a pizza that wasn't less than perfect."}
{"text":"Great food great people very clean Facility i own a few businesses in the area so i look into and notice the little things that make all the difference in practicing a succes business and they are doing it right fiesta has had my business for many years and will continue to have it from my family and i getting food from here is like getting it from a family member they always know how you like it and make it to your satisfaction for any reason you have had a bad experience please  just like any business these things might come up and happen i guarantee they will make it right and make sure you are satisfied all you have to do is bring it to their attention thanks Fiesta(CUYAHOGA FALLS) keep up the good work and as always god bless!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The Bailey road location is carry out only. No seating. They have a sprinkled sausage that is amazing! We've also had the chicken and jojos, which are also good, but the pizza is our favorite."}
{"text":"The guy working was very friendly, but the pizza- not so great. First off, the smallest \"large\" pizza I've ever seen (especially for the price, which is not cheap at all). Quality would have probably been decent if it wasn't severely under cooked. And it was also very greasy, which I'm not a fan of."}
