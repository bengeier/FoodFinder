{"text":"Definitely a recommended place to go, food is amazing, and the service is perfect. I'll be back here very soon."}
{"text":"What makes me and my family come back again and again is exceptional food, great service, warm cozy atmosphere and good price. 

Always look for the daily special on the chalk board on top of the pizza oven. It's always good. We had tried most of the dishes on their menu. For appetizers, we love their salads. Both of their grilled and fried Calamari are tender and tasty. The mussels itself of course depends on the season, but their sauce is so good, you will want to finish the last drop with the garlic with bread. 

I don't normally like cheese pizza, but I just can't resist their Margherita pizza. I'd say it's addictive! we love most of the pasta, especially the medaglioni ai pomodori secchi and their pasta sauce is to die for. 

When you order pasta dishes here, you can change the pasta and the sauce to your liking :) If you have a favorite Italian dish you want but it's not on the menu, talk to the waiter/waitress. The chef may make it for you. That's what we were told by the waitress. 

This place is always busy, especially in the weekend, when they don't take reservations. We are well prepared to wait when we walk in the door. The hostess is friendly and always give us a good idea on our waiting time. She also takes down our number and calls when our table is ready. We can take off to have a stroll at the mall or even Vaughan Mills when the wait is incredibly long."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!! If youre looking for an authentic dose of Italian food this is the place to go!!
I always get the linguini with vegetables in a rose sauce.. absolutely delish!! And im vegetarian, so I love that they accommodate their menu dishes to meet my needs! 
Their pizzas are phenomenal, baked to perfection, nice and thin. So good! And their prices are pretty reasonable.
I've brought several friends here after finding out about this place, love 'em !! :)"}
{"text":"Visited Marcellos and must say i can't see what all the hype is. Pizza ain't that great and tastes like canned marinara sauce. Pasta was ok but nothing to wait in line for...service was slow for the amount of people at the time (2:30pm). Better places to eat and won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is always good. Came here with my best friend one night and we ordered a pizza to start and pasta for our entree. Joel was our server. He is amazing!!! he was very attentive and helpful with menu items and putting in our order in great timing of our app and entree. I would definitely come back!! Over all great Italian food and service!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizzeria. Sometimes the wait can be extraordinarily long. The marcellos salad is a great starter."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with the family. Enjoyed the really quick service along with tasty Italian pizza pies and pasta. Lots of dishes to choose from and priced just right."}
{"text":"Hands down best tiramisu I have ever had.  I imagine there is a nonna is in the back kitchen making them fresh every day...don't ruin it for me if there isn't.  The place is always busy and you can always expect to walk away stuffed.  Their pizzas are light and are the perfect size to share.  I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"As good as advertised. We had wine, pizza and pasta. Everything was great. The house wines are a great value - 1 litre of wine for under $25 - we had the montepulciano and it was very good. I can't remember the specific pizza or pasta we had but both were very good. 

The only downside is the atmosphere and decor - it is only OK. The staff was very good and helpful, other than the annoyingly condescending corrections on how to pronounce obscure Italian menu items. That's always fun. Maybe next time just pretend you understood me and I'll ask if I want to know. 

But the most important thing is that the food is great."}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas and pastas. I always order the seafood pasta; copious amount of fresh seafood.  Their freshly made Neapolitan pizza is so tasty."}
{"text":"First timer....truly a great Italian dining experience from the antipasto .... pizza....and linguini entre....there for lunch on a Tuesday and they were busy...great service....reasonably priced with a great selection.... highly recommend ....As Arnold says...... Ill be back"}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. Food is decent, prices aren't bad either. Pizza is the way to go when coming here. They charge for hot water though _ that's a shame. Otherwise, it's an okay place to eat."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place after I complained that there were no good places to eat pasta in the burbs! Boy was I wrong.

We came for a super early dinner (~5pm) on Sat because she told me it would be packed at their normal times. We ordered a pizza di parma (garlic, cheese, prosciutto, and arugula) and the fiorellini fantasia pasta (chicken, spinach, red pepers, in a tomato cream sauce) to share. They were both big portions and very tasty AND it was very reasonably priced. I can't wait to go back and try the other things!

As we were leaving around 6pm, the line up to get in was definitely growing so if you want to eat there go early to grab spots since apparently they don't take reservations for Fri, Sat and Sun."}
{"text":"The food here is unreal! Probably one of the best Italian places we've ever been to! 
It looks classy enough for fancy events and first dates but it can be casual too! I've tried both their pizzas and their pastas and I honestly don't know which one I like better! 
And the prices are very reasonable for what they give you. 
But it gets busy so beware!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent outdoor dining. Had an excellent pizza with grilled chicken, mozzarella, and goat cheese. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Have been going since they opened in Vaughan. Have tried lots of other items on their menu and have found them all to be good. If you are in the mood for meat, their Veal Chop is excellent. One of my favorite places. Not the best place to go to have a quiet meal, it's very noisy! Do not take reservations on Fri and Sat nights, so if you show up at dinner time, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Terrible service and very rude to  customers. They are definitely not customer driven.. I do not  recommend  Desserts Plus is a better choice"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food in the area. Considering that it is a mid range eatery, they do make better food then some upscale Italian restaurants. Everything is always fresh and really big portions. Well priced, have nice patio, great service. They get very busy in the evenings. The only disappointment last visit was tiramisu. 2 years ago they had the best tiramisu, last week it was completely different, like you buy in the store. They should get the old recipe back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't! I was excited to try this place because of all the reviews here, but this place was just another bland, italian restaurant.

Pros:
-got to sit on the patio which was nice
-tiramisu was AMAZING. 
-veal parm was good, just that, good, nothing more, nothing less
-pricing is perfect for the portions


Cons:
-fettuccine alfonzo was such a letdown. There was no flavour, literally tasted like cream. 

I know there's another location on St. Clair, maybe one day i'll try it. But for now I'm going to steer clear of any Marcellos"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza ... it was thin crust and full of flavour.  

Lineups are long and a bit disorganized at entrance, but worth the wait!  We were 10 people and waited just over an hour.... they don't take reservations!

Enjoyed the antipasto appetizer, it's huge and delish!  - perfect for two!  It can  also be a meal for one!

Yes I will go back..... I enjoyed the experience and food very much!"}
{"text":"Went after shopping at Vaughan Mills Outlet and had a pleasant meal.
I had a taste of 3 dishes;
Usual bread to start, side of butter, or balsamic/ olive oil they have on the table.

Fried calamari
Crispy, light salt to taste

Linguini de Mare
Lots of seafood, pasta cooked right with tasty sauce. There was no overpowering smell of seafood or tomato like 
a lot of other pasta served elsewhere

Fettuccine Alfonzo
Creamy, with lots of mushrooms and grilled chicken (which was flavourful and not dry) 

Frienldy staff, fast service, very affordable and flavourful menu. Much better than some Italian restaurants in Mississauga that's double the cost.

Will definitely be back for pizza.

edit: their pizza is delicious as well"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome selection of pastas. Service is always so fast and this place is always packed. They don't take reservations on weekends either. Pizzas are very authentic"}
{"text":"What happens when you arrive on a super busy evening? You're met with friendly and attentive service, that's what.

Great food, great service, great experience. I'll surely be back."}
{"text":"Good food. 
Accommodating service for large group with small kids. 
Would revisit and recommend for others."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few places I go to for Italian food. There pasta and pizza are always cooked perfect. Their mussels are the best in Toronto. The sauce is so good that I usually finish it with bread too.

This place never disappoint me."}
{"text":"Really REALLY great pizza. Had the veal, it was slathered in cheese and sauce and was very filling. Perfect portion for the price, was not left hungry. I got a pizza for the group (of 4) and that came out to two slices per person for a large pizza (perfect!)

Service was very pleasant, and the atmosphere was fine.
Overall, really good family place."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Marcello's in Toronto so figured that since I was in Woodbridge it would be great to check out their other location.

The food was fantastic on par with the Toronto location. Service was warm and friendly. There was a little bit of a wait, but that's to be expected at any good restaurant.

Best calamari bar none!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this very simple, you will not have a bad dish at Marcello's . It's a great go to place and is probably the best bang for buck in the city 

Notables 

Pasta Puglia 
Pizza 
Veal chop 

And of course the tiramisu (best in the city) 

If you haven't been there yet you probably live out of town, great spot hands down

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Before I light a fire under their ass for my recent experience, I want to say that I've been to Marcello's before and it's always been decent. By \"decent\" I mean that it's great for the price. It's not the BEST food in the world, but for the price point, I have had no complaints until yesterday. 

We had a 6:30 reservation for a post-wedding rehearsal dinner with a party of 16. We had called them before 6:30 to tell them that we were running late. The response we got on the phone was along the lines of \"ok\", which in my world, would imply that they would hold our table. We showed up 6:45 (15 minutes late) and they had given away our table! When we told the hostess about the situation and that we had called, she rudely responded that \"we have a graduation party here if you guys had come on time we would've been able to seat you\". 

I'm very understanding of restaurants. I understand that they have a business to run and that it would be in their best interest to seat whoever comes first. My problem with this is that they had SAID that it wouldn't be a problem, but we arrived 15 minutes late to find out that it had become a problem. 

Since we were such a large party, we waited. We were seated and served eventually but no amount of pomodoro meatballs could wipe away the sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I've been to Italy a couple of times and this restaurant's atmosphere give me that home feeling. Taste is probably top in Vaughan. What throws me off is that when its during busy dinner time, they don't have enough staff so it's very hard to waive someone for service. I give it three stars for its authencity but there are much better Italian resto downtown."}
{"text":"The service in this place is great but the food was below par.  I found the food to be more \"american italian\" and less authentic.    Maybe I ordered the \"wrong\" dish.  I ordered the special which was sole fish with potatoes and vegetables.  It was very tasteless, I couldn't even finish it.  I wanted a small dessert and the waiter suggested that he can bring me 1/2 of a slice of cake which seemed like a good idea.  It was still huge (can feed two people) and was not very good at all."}
{"text":"Came here a few times, and the food and service was always excellent. Tried a few items on their menu and was mostly satisfied. I came with coworkers a few times and it can get really busy during lunch hours, so be prepared to have a longer lunch."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Marcellos. We ordered the calamari (amazing, especially when you add extra lemon), gnocchi (which I'm not a huge fan of in general, but this was quite delish), a pizza w/ prosciutto, asiago cheese and arugula (only complaint:  not enough prosciutto), and a caprese salad (perfection). 

Price is decent - under $60 for everything described above. Great service, great atmosphere, and great quality food."}
{"text":"The place is good and has delicious food. But I have to rate them a 1 star (lower if i could) for ruining  my birthday dinner. I had gone in the night before to speak with a manager about having a group of 20. I told him I knew they have a no reservation policy but since it's a big crowd I need to feel secure; he assure me numerous times it won't be a problem. The next day comes and when I went inside to get the table. The manager at the time told me she has no idea what I'm taking about and she can't do anything for me; she didn't even try and basically called me a liar for telling her someone assured me the night before. She said \"we don't have any male managers and we don't take reservations\".  Here I am with a group of 20 and no where to go on a Saturday night with balloons in my hand. I haven't been back since even tho it used to be my go to spot."}
{"text":"I haven't been here as much as I would've liked to, but that's only because I prefer to eat at places outside of my area. 

The restaurant definitely gives me classic Italian vibes (if that's even a thing). The colour scheme is simple, but sophisticated. Really great. 

I've only had their pizza and it is really delicious. The pizza bianca is a white pizza with arugula, speck (smoked prosciutto), figs (just to name a few toppings) and it's drizzled with a balsamic glaze. Can't really remember what I had the first time I went, but that was what I had at my most recent outing. 

The service is friendly and the only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 was the experience I had getting takeout. It took a while before someone acknowledged me both at the door and at the takeout counter. Left a sour taste in my mouth, but it's not that big of a deal and I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. Things happen.

Hopefully I'll make some time to be back again."}
{"text":"I was meeting with my magnificent Aunt in Vaughan for a quick lunch during the work week, typically, we're both a little picky when it comes to Italian food (given our shared heritage) but when she strongly endorsed the food at Marcellos, I knew we had to give it a try.

Tucked in the corner of one of the three sections of the Tuscany place plaza outside of Vaughan Mills mall, it's exterior facade masks it's true size inside - it's frickin' HUGE! Dining to the left, the right, the front and way in the back. If 100+ people weren't seated I'd be surprised. And let me remind you all... this was lunch! Packed! Another positive vote of confidence before I even sat down!

We were seated quickly and after much deliberation we both decided on a glass of house Cab Sauv to start and an Arugula Salad. Now I know veggies are cheap but holy smoke, the salad for one (as an appetizer) could easily EASILY feed 3-4 people as an appetizer. Like it was a struggle to muscle the whole thing down. Huge shards of parmigiano cheese, giant walnuts and a light lemony dressing. I could have had this all by itself and been perfectly content. Highly recommend this salad!

For my main I went with one of the wood oven cooked pizzas: Diavola Pizza - tomato sauce, mozzarella, hot sopressata, hot peppers, onions and black olives. It was cooked perfectly with only the slightest fleck of char on the crust and on the bottom. Also the marriage of the toppings were outstanding. I scarfed 3/4 of it down before I remembered to breath. Their personal pizzas are the perfect size for one (or two if you're watching your figure or not fully hungry). I'm greedy so even if I couldn't finish my pizza, the leftovers were coming with me!

Why not a 5 star? Well I had issue with the turn around time on the pizza. I understand they were busy, but if I had been in a rush to eat and leave I woulda been pissed as the wait time between salad and pizza was almost 40 minutes. I was starving by the time it came. I think there needs to be a little more snap to the kitchen as they turn out the pizzas. Other than wait time, this was a great lunch experience that I would come back for again!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Good food, nothing worth bringing this to a three star.  I can see if someone is not Italian they may say its great food, but its not.  The staff is miserable and doesn't want to be there, and they actually get upset or annoyed with you, If you asked two or more questions about the menu.  In short the staff is outrageous, and hilarious in a WTF way."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday night and will definitely be coming back! Arrived around 7:45 and was seated immediately, the waiter was helpful in ordering and the food arrived very quickly despite a long line up shortly after we arrived. I had a half order of penne a la vodka and shared a margarita pizza with my friend. Both were delicious! The penne was slightly undercooked to my taste, however I don't like my pasta al dente and much prefer it softer. The delicious sauce made up for this as I found myself swallowing the pasta whole because I just couldn't stop eating.

The pizza was also incredible! I did find the cheese left it a little greasy, but I just blotted it with my napkin to soak some of it up and it was fine. I also prefer my pizza well done, but I forgot to ask for it like this so, just like the pasta being al dente, I cannot complain about it.

Overall, a great meal, I paid $20 for my pizza and half pasta, a ton of food for a more than decent price. The waiter was on his game for most of the night, he seemed to go AWOL for a little but other waiters were paying attention to us while this happened, maybe he was on break?

I would recommend trying out Marcello's to anyone around Vaughan Mills, I am about 20 minutes from there but wouldn't hesitate to make the drive for great food!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the exceptional pasta here. The place gets packed so come early or make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Linguine del mare 4 star seafood was delicious 
Calamari 4 star most tender I've ever had
Service is 4 star they get busy

Yes if you want good Italian food."}
{"text":"Excellent family restaurant. If pizza is your pleasure that's where you have it. Their pastas, salads and panini are mouth watering. It's very Affordable, the only down fall of this great place is, no reservations on the weekends, so you'll have to wIt in line! But other than that I give it a 4 out of 5. 
Ivp./Wdbrdg..."}
{"text":"Always good food best value but lineups every weekend. Gamberi diavola is good but add in some calamari and sub in the mussel broth for the thick paste and it would be tops.  Not as big a pizza fan here but pasta dishes are great.  Try the one with fior di latte too.  Antipasto platter is fantastic"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  I havent tried the pasta and smells amzing.  I had their mushroom soup which was also great.  They have great wine selection and fast service.  

I order and pick up from here all the time."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to for Italian food for years. Decent prices, friendly service and amazing Italian food. Worst part is it's always busy and we always need to wait for a table. Reservations are not allowed on weekends so rip, gotta go at like 5. The bread they give is also cold but there's olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and hot chili oil on the side for dipping. Tip go for the specials, there always bomb! The og menu is pre blessed too though."}
{"text":"Always solid. Nice atmosphere, not expensive and good food."}
{"text":"Originally went all the way to Vaughan to try the Grazie Italian Restaurant there, but ended up going here instead because Grazie's wait was way too long (45 minutes)

And aren't we glad we came here!!! It was impressive.
Delicious flavor all around.

Great ambiance, felt like you were in italy. My guests and I were there for a nice dinner and we started off with some nice red wine and a grilled calamari appetizer. It was really nicely seasoned and fresh tasting, the calamari was gone from the plate within about 2 minutes.

I was really craving for pizza that night so I ordered that and I loved it. Thin crust, great light pizza. 

Finished off with a tiramisu dessert, save your stomach for this!! Its well worth it!

If it wasn't so far away from where I live, i would be a regular here for sure, maybe I will go check out the St Clair location soon."}
{"text":"Food was passable.  What ticked me off was the fact that they charged for re-fills and would not give separate bills.  Party foul on both counts.  Hey, newsflash, you're not fancy a place!"}
{"text":"This is a great Italian place. Went with 4 other friends, shared orders of pasta and pizza. All very delicious.  The pizza crust was perfect, not too thick or thin.  Service was friendly and efficient. We got lucky by few minutes and beat the crowd. The atmosphere was noisy and vibrant, a comfy place to chat with your friends loudly."}
{"text":"avoid at all cost. not authentic. worst so called italian restaurant ever!!! and people actually line up...nothing against the staff, nor establishment, just food is terrible!"}
{"text":"AMAZING pasta and pizza! I got a pizza to share as an appetizer which i highly recommend to anyone who isn't planning to get a pizza as your main.  Pizza al pollo - goat cheese, spinach, chicken and sundried tomatoes.  super thin crust, a good amount of toppings, and great crust :)  if you like sundried tomatoes, the pieces they give you are huge.

For my main i got fiorellini fantasia - pasta with chicken, spinach, roasted red peppers with a tomato cream sauce.  this was actually out-standing!!! The portion was big, the sauce was SO good and they didnt skimp out on the ingredients. this place is my new obsession."}
{"text":"This is def one of my favourie italian plc so far, price is reasonable, service and food is amazing.
Downside is they don't take reservation and always lineup here.  We always com here early on weekdays for dinner to get a table.

What's recommended?  Any pizza and pasta is amazing and that's why we keep going back."}
{"text":"Location: 3175 Vaughan (in the same plaza as National Bank)
Price: $$
Service: Alright

Just this pass Saturday I went for dinner there with a friend. We tried to get reservation in case- but they do not do reservations on the weekends at all. However, they did tell us that our waiting time would be 40mins- luckily it was a speedy wait because we were seated in 10mins. 

We shared an appetizer and dessert.; calamari  and tiramisu cake. The calamari were not the typical fried and breaded- these were grilled and topped off with olive oil, lemon and basil pesto. Even though, it wasn't the orthodox calamari- I felt it was a lot better. Reason being that it seemed more health because it is grilled and the basil pesto sauce gave it an amazing kick! I died how delicious it was... I got the Riatoni alla Bolognese for the entree and it was delicious. The pasta was just right- not too mushy or too chewy. 

Of course! A meal is never really finished without DESSERT. Since it was an Italian restaurant we had to get the tiramisu cake- it was also highly recommended by our server. It definitely did not disappoint.

This restaurant is also very family friendly as there were a lot of families there. In addition to couples and groups of friends.

Overall it was an A-OK."}
{"text":"Fabulous italian restaurant. Great place to go with the kids for pizza or pasta. Service is fast and food is consistently good. My only complaint is that this restaurant is too good and as such it's impossible to get a table without having to wait. What makes matters worsens that the have a no reservation policy during peak times :-("}
{"text":"This restaurant is my family's go-to for any occasion. It can get really busy, but I personally enjoy the atmosphere and conversation while I wait. An excellent menu, the food is fail-proof and will never disappoint. Can't go wrong with Marcello's always happy to stop by when in the area."}
{"text":"Has gone downhill slowly over time...sad."}
{"text":"We got fresh bread served with three different oils. As for the appetizer, we ordered the calamari. It was piping hot, cooked perfectly, but I wished it could be more crispy. For your pasta dish, they give an entire bowl of parmesan cheese and chilli flakes. We just had to try the pizza. The crust was flaky but crispy, the flavors of sweet and salty combined with the nuttiness from the arugula was just perfection. I have to come back and order each pizza lol.. The pasta was perfectly cooked just how I liked it, al dente with the creamy sauce made the dish stand out. A little slow on service but I could see our server was pretty busy doing a lot of things. I will definitely be back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"This is best Italian I have had in the GTA area!! Excellent tasting food and a reasonable price. The location has great atmosphere and the staff are wonderful but you better get there early as this a very popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Saturday. Located right next to Vaughan mills the crowd that they get seems to be more or less family with young children. Wait was not long for lunch time but I heard it can get up to an hour and a half wait if You go on a weekend during dinner time.

As we walked in, staff were very friendly and greeted us quickly with a smile on their face. We ordered the calamari to start and shared the chicken Alfredo and barasse pizza. Bread is served to the table with 2 different types of olive oil and 1 balsamic vinegar. Pretty standard bread but can be tasty when hungry! Calamari came quickly.. definitely don't come here for their food presentation as my calamari was all over the plate and scattered since we only had about 12 pieces. Served with a little bit of arugula underneath. Taste wise... lack of salt and had no sauce to dip the calamari in. Was disappointed and ended up using the chilli oil as our dip. It as also quite soggy and the breading was falling apart. 

Chicken Alfredo fettuccine was pretty standard.. And nothing wowed me from it. Good amount of chicken portion but the sauce was overly liquidy.. the barasse (?) Pizza was this and tastless.. lacked in cheese and the rapini had an odd taste to it (sort of like horseradish.....). I love rapini and was so happy to see that on the menu but was quite disappointed afterwards.

Pricing was a little on the higher side for what you're getting. A plate on average is $15 but the food was not overly Taste nor was the presentation done nicely.

I don't think we will be coming back to give mediocre food another chance."}
{"text":"So my cousin and I decided to dine at this restaurant. It was my cousin's suggestion to come here as she had been here before with her friends. When we entered, we were assisted to our table promptly. Our waitress was very nice and helpful throughout my whole experience. 

Decor:
The restaurant's decor was pretty simple. I can't wait to dine here during the summer. Their patio looked very inviting. 

Food:
We started off with the *Arancini Con Pomodoro*, which were pretty much risotto balls with tomato sauce. It was pretty basic tasting. Inside the risotto balls were mozarella cheese. I did decide to get the Fettuccine Alfonzo, which was fettuccine pasta with porcini mushrooms, grilled chicken, and delicious roasted garlic cream sauce. That was delicious. I loved how the garlic cream sauce brings out the taste of porcini mushrooms. Okay, I have to admit that my salivary glands are being activated just thinking of the taste lol.  Loooooovvvveeeeeee."}
{"text":"Same menue as on St. Clair in Toronto but due to bad aquatics, long lines and green salads that are not always fresh (at my last 3 visits I had black rotten leaves) I give it 3. Definitely less attention to quality as it is in the original Toronto location."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a weekday dinner with the familia. The place was just getting busy for the dinner rush and after a 10 minute wait we were seated and quickly ordered the burrata app along with four mains: orecchiette with sausage; arugula pizza; ravioli; and gnocchi dishes. All came out well sized, hot and flavorful. The only drawback was the amount of oil used in the orecchiette dish as well as the pizza, both were too oily. 
For a place that usually does great dishes, I was disappointed but will notch it up to a bad night.
Service was prompt and attentive as usual so that was appreciated.
I'll be back but not till I can shake off that oily feeling!"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner tonight and all was perfect as usual.

Four of us had Mussels, 2 different pizzas, and a special made meal of grilled veal with misto salad.

All was very flavourful and hot.

That's why we keep going back!"}
{"text":"My collegues love coming here. One of them happens to be Italian and he loves Chinese food. So what does that tell me?

Actually it tells me he knows pasta.  Italian or Chinese makes no difference to me.

This place is fast fast fast when it come to Ordering, and plating and getting the bill.  They have pretty fast turnaround but only because they can get busy.  

Why are they busy?  Silly you!!, because they're good!  Why else would they be busy and people writing up nice reviews.  It's not cause the servers are handsome. Well, ok they are.

Salads, healthily delicious.  I ordered the insalata di arugula (bit pricey for what you get, but maybe it's a good thing?  Maybe it's organic and hand picked from a local farmer with delicate hands)  and the pizzas are pies from heaven. I love the crust and the selection that isn't Pizza Pizza.  (The only good thing about that place is the jingle).  OK the pizza here is terrific.  Like when Tony the Tiger says it but with an Italian accent.

I didn't get to try the pastas, but what I had so far was good enough for me.

The coffee is decent too I might add.

I wouldn't say this if it wasn't true for me.  I really enjoyed it here.
I wish we had a place like this where I live.  I'd be there every week.  Seriously.  All we get is Chicken Chow Mein and Ramen."}
{"text":"This place is insane.. Diavola pizza is my favourite in Toronto as of 5 minutes ago. It's perfection, salty, spicy, cheesy, crispy, chewy deliciousness..
Rock star fried calamari
Very yummy caprese...
The seafood pasta looked outstanding, I'm getting that next time...
Very friendly service... Just f'n wow to everything.
For me best pizza anywhere..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, the staff is very rude! I e tried getting take out here a few times, we called ahead and spoke to multiple people and the staff seem to all be having a bad day!?! 
The salads are so simple
And yet over priced..."}
{"text":"I came during a weekday with a friend at 7:30pm and the restaurant was packed. We had a wait time of 20mins so we sat outside to enjoy the fresh air. When our table was ready, our hostess texted us.

The service was a little bit slow but completely understandable because this place was PACKED. Our server was really pleasant though and checked up on us a couple times that night. 

We ordered chicken fettuccine and margarita pizza to share. Both were excellent but thought the fettuccine was slightly bland. I usually get penne a la vodka when I come here but wanted to try something different this time... I feel like I should've stuck with penne a la vodka instead. 

This is my go to restaurant for good Italian food and the wait is totally worth it. If you don't like longer wait times, you can always call in reservations or dine before/after the dinner rush"}
{"text":"In summary, definitely worth a trip and recommendation given the good balance of food quality, service, price, location, and ambiance. 

Came here with a party of 5 on a Saturday night. If it weren't for Vaughan Mills next door, we would likely not have waited the hour for our table. So like what lots of folks have said, make a reservation! We had a round of beer, two pizzas as appetizers, and all pastas as mains. 

Pros: 
- Great food quality! Very fresh and well-portioned. The flavours were very rich and bursting in everything we had - so much so it would suffice to stay away from the  saucy/creamy/cheesy dishes which would be too heavy if not shared.

- Fast and courteous service: our server was attentive, replenishing our water and bread without asking. Not particularly warm or nice, just courteous.

- Bustling and warm atmosphere - may be too loud for some? 

- Price was quite reasonable. Pizzas were around $12-15 each, pastas $12-16, mains $17-25, our bottled beers were $4.5. If the environment was more comfortable, we would have likely stayed for dessert/coffee.



Cons:
- The wait will definitely turn people off/away - again, make that reservation....!

- The seating wasn't that comfortable. Something about the chairs made our bums keep shifting around the whole dinner. And the table arrangements were a bit too close for privacy and conversation.... but I guess it's part of the ambiance???"}
{"text":"I've been to this location about a dozen times, there's also one located on St. Clair West.  I've enjoyed each of my visits because well once again the food is authentic italian food!

The pizza cooked in a wood oven is always what does it for me!  Their gnocchis are delicious!

The atmosphere is very modern and very exciting!  It makes me feel like I'm in italy everytime i'm there!  The prices are decent and honestly worth the drive to Vaughan - the only downside they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I lie in bed, nursing a food hang-over from a wild night at Marcellos. You know, the food hang-over...a morning of regret and sluggishness that succeeds a night of over-indulging on delicious but carb-filled goods...slowly coming to terms with the fact that your body just can't handle bread and pasta like it used to. My friends, please eat carbs responsibly. 

What we ordered:  
Frittura di Calamari ($10.95) - Good but not amazing. Despite being deep fried, the breading was a little too soft and also kept detaching from the calamari. Good deal for the price though.
Pizza Mia ($14.25) - Pesto with grilled chicken, grilled eggplant, goat cheese, and sundried tomatoes. As a fan of pesto, this was like finding a unicorn amongst a field of typical tomato based sauced pizzas. Happy to report that it did not disappoint. Toppings complemented each other perfectly, and the thin crust was perfectly chewy yet crispy. Note that this is not the healthiest option, as displayed by a layer of green grease that resided on my plate. Tell me why that did not stop me from continuing to devour the entire pizza and a quarter of my friend's pasta. Ughh.  
Fiorellini Fantasia ($14.50) - Very pretty swirly pasta with chicken and spinach. Pasta was made perfectly al dente in an amazing creamy tomato sauce. Also very generously portioned. 

Out of anywhere I could have over-indexed my carb quota though, I'm glad it was at Marcello's - a place with fun and delizioso food at very reasonable prices.  *Insert gesture where I pinch fingers together, kiss them, and toss away*"}
{"text":"I was looking for a child friendly restaurant to take my family for dinner. A co-worker suggested Marcello's. it was nice to see that other families with small children were enjoying themselves. 
Our waiter was very friendly to the kids. He even helped them connect to the free wi-fi. 
Everything we ordered was delicious. It arrived quickly and was hot. The pizzas we ordered were a hit with the kids. 
I gave a 4 only because my daughter said the pasta sauce didn't taste like Nonna's. Highly recommended for a nice family night out."}
{"text":"As we walked towards our Patio table(Nice!), we sat and was served our drink order and some bread with butter but the butter was not the choice here if you pay attention to the condiment bottles on your table you'll realize the ROSEMARY OLIVE OIL which is great for dipping the bread into.

The FRIENDLY waitress said the Barese Pizza was a new item that the other customers love so we went for it.  It had some Red Hot Chili Pepper cut into small rounds along with the Italian Hot Sausage, Rapini and Mozzarela.  The pizza crust was thin and crispy, but I think in the back of my mind that it was just like a Grilled Panini because there was no Tomato Sauce to bind the ingredients together.  Maybe I've haven't had enough of this variety of Pizza experience.

The Proscuitto Panini is standard Bocconcini, Arugula, Roma Tomatoes, and Prosciutto but what stands out is the Crispy FLAT Bread itself that I've never seen before.  Pizza Dough was used for this Flat Bread and wrapped around the ingredients but not fully enclosing it like a Panzerotti.  It came with a side salad but the Panini was a good portion in it's own rights.

Aside from a personal preference of not liking the White Pizza, everything seemed to be A-OK.  Although we came around 4-5 pm on a Friday afternoon, there were still more customers than other restaurants usually see around here."}
{"text":"We came on the weekend a few minutes before the place open and there were tons of hungry people waiting outside.  The restaurant is fairly large so we did not have any issue getting a table.

The food were decent, we ordered calamari as appetizer, couple of pizzas and pastas to try.  Pizza was good oozing with cheese and a nice thin crust.  Order came really quick even though all the tables had just filled up.  We topped our lunch of with Tiramisu, and I have to say I really enjoyed that.

Our wait staff seemed a little annoyed at time (we definitely weren't being difficult), this is impacting my rating a bit.  Perhaps my rating will change on a future visit"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here.  Every time we go the pasta and pizza are always fabulous.  The customer service is excellent and the food is always great."}
{"text":"My family to Marcellos for lunch today. After a 45 minute wait, we were finally seated.  Service was slow and we had to ask for wait staff to take our order.  There was hardly enough bread for the table and we were not offered any more.  It took a long time for our appetizers to arrive.

The food was average at best.  We started with bruschetta which wasn't great. We had two pasta dishes which were average.  I had a pizza which was not fantastic.  We had a panini which was not good at all.  At no time during the meal did any wait staff ask how it was or if we wanted anything else.  I had to call someone to refill my Diet Coke at which time I was told that refills are not free.  I told her that I did not mind paying for another glass.

Overall, it was not an enjoyable lunch.  It was my first and last time there."}
{"text":"Adorable little place for a date. Me and my boyfriend go here for their pizza. Their pizza is delicious, I especially love that I can choose my own toppings. I had their pasta once, it had mushrooms and chicken in it I don't remember the name but I wasn't a fan. The service is okay, not the best. But the Pizza is a must if you're in vaughn!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girl's night out with my cousin and sister in law to celebrate her birthday. This restaurant came highly recommended by my cousin's Italian friends. It is located in a strip mall close to Vaughan Mills. The atmosphere of the restaurant has a homestyle family feel to it. At 4:30pm on a Sunday it wasn't busy but there was a lineup outside the door when we left at 7:30pm. 

The menu consists of a great selection of appetizers, pizzas, pastas, as well as some entrees. Instead of a traditional appetizer, we ordered a pizza to share as well as a pasta for each of us. Bread and butter were served but we didn't eat them because we were anticipating the pizza would be filling. They have flavoured olive oils and balsamic vinegar on the table as well to enjoy with the bread.

The pizza had a relatively thin crust but maintained it's crispness despite the numerous toppings. I really enjoyed the cotto pizza which had olive paste, mozzarella and goat cheeses, prosciutto and arugula. It was light and cheesy at the same time, the best of both worlds for me. I would definitely order that again, especially since I'm a huge fan of goat cheese.

My linguine di Mazara had a garlic olive oil base with large pieces of shrimp in it. The serving size is very generous and I was only able to eat about 2/3 of my pasta, it was that filling. My sister in law had the linguine di mare, and you could certainly taste the seafood shining throughout this dish.

For dessert my dinner companions ordered the tiramisu and I had the Nutella cheesecake. The tiramisu is light, with just the right amount of mascarpone cheese while maintaining a light and airy ladyfinger base. The Nutella cheesecake was less cheesecakey and more like a dense chocolate torte, with a delicious rich chocolate hazelnut flavour and texture, with the crunch of ground hazelnuts in the crust and whole pieces of hazelnuts in the filling itself. If you like chocolate and hazelnut, this was so worth the calories!

I really enjoyed the food, and the servers were attentive. I will definitely be back with the hubby and my family!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff.

We had a big party and managed to get a nice spread of items. Pizzas and panini were all very good.

The only downside is that it seemed to take quite a while for the food to arrive. Mind you the place was packed so that may have had something to do with it.

I'll certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice now, I really like it here. Everything I have ordered has been tasty and fresh. You feel like you are at an Italian house, eating authentic food. The vibe is frenetic and loud but welcoming.

This visit I opted for the arugula salad with walnuts and pecorino cheese, in a lemon oil vinaigrette - super refreshing and tasty. Alongside the salad, I opted for the minestrone soup, which was very comforting and delicious. I enjoyed dipping copious amounts of lightly buttered fresh bread into the savoury broth - YUM!

My BF ordered a pizza with prosciutto and arugula, and it was very well cooked and flavourful.

Solid food option while in the Vaughan Mills area for sure!"}
{"text":"This would've gotten 4.5-5 stars if the service had been better.
I went on a Tuesday night for dinner with friends from work.
I found the food was pretty good (I had the penne alla vodka. $12.50) and reasonably priced.
I've heard great things about the pizza here but I was in the mood for pasta. I'll have a nibble of that next time we go.
There are many more pastas here I want to try.
As it was a Tuesday night, I didn't think it would be that busy. We arrived at five and there were only two other tables of two there but by 5:30 the place was packed.
Our server wasn't the friendliest of people and she was hardly around.
I was impressed at how quickly we got the food though.
My water was never refilled (although the other girls with me said there's were) and I never saw the server again until after we already had the bill.
The bill also cannot be split which I found annoying."}
{"text":"Sooo good.
Their pizzas are delicious, and so are the pastas. I've had quite a few things off the menu my favourite is the Terra pizza and the Penne alla vodka - sooo good. 
A staple lunch spot in my office, I've also come at dinner and it's been equally busy and always good.
Generous portions, and the in house stone oven makes the pizzas primo"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of people for some authentic Italian food, with expectations considering the Real-Housewives-of-New-Jersey-esque location. 

Don't judge me. 

They have a large enclosed patio, though the view is not special since the restaurant is located in a fairly new strip mall just North of Vaughan Mills mall. 

They were about 40 minutes to closing, thanks to our ever-so-late dining buddies. Our host hesitated, slightly, but seated us in the middle of the restaurant. Our waitress took some time to warm up to us, but she was eager to please after a minute of ice-breaking banter. 

Maybe she was a little shy? 

The Bruschetta, though we were famished, was slightly underwhelming but definitely status-quo considering the Fazzoletto which was very dough-y and an undercooked dough-y version of a real Fazzoletto that I would have liked to try. 

The pizza is easily the main attraction at Marcello's. I could write a love song to it, but take my word and try it for yourself. 

Terra is the veggiest- veggie bomb of a pizza. With extremely fresh toppings you'll be left wondering if they hand-pick them out from a garden every morning. The crust is thin, crunchy and ever-so-lightly oiled. 

I also tried the Gnocchi Al Pomodoro, but it was underwhelming after the pizza. The sauce was a little underseasoned and watery for my liking."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations on the weekend so I came in around 8:30 to have a table. They told me 40 minutes and I left my number with them to call. When I came back with the rest of my party 30 minutes later, it turns out they crossed my name out! They never called me and so when I showed them my call logs, the hostess was gracious and seated us immediately. 

The bread was...alright. Nothing fancy. My only complaint is that the waiter took the dip for the bread and gave it to another table and we ended up having to ask that table to pass it back. Ordering was...kind of a pain, partly because I was indecisive since I really was split between ordering 2 pizza's. So, the waiter just...walked away? Took us another 5 minutes before we got his attention to complete the whole table's order again.
 
The food was decent, though I felt like the toppings could've been a bit more abundant. I liked the sauce and the sopressata. I honestly wanted to rate this a bit higher, but it felt like the entire party just got left swiped on Tinder. 

The tiramisu dessert was great, but it was really big. Easily enough for 2 or more people and definitely for sharing. I ordered a coke and apparently, they didn't include refills.

I've had better pizza elsewhere, so sadly, I don't think I'll be coming again of my own volition.

Service: 2
Food: 4
Time: 4

Note: Oh and for some reason, I just personally got irritated by their menu's font. It was extremely cumbersome to read because it was so incredibly loopy."}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza!!!
Yummy yummy yummy. I can't wait to go back! 
I customized my pizza, ordering a pizza with fior di latte cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms. It was amazing. 
There was a long wait - 45 minutes. But it was so worth it. 
Prices are very fair as well. About $14/15 for a large pizza and I had a delicious Tartufo ice cream ball for $5. 
Kicking it down a star in my review was that there was no cocktail menu. Only a wine menu. It would of been nice to have a sangria (which they do not do) or have a cocktail menu to select from. 
It would also be nice to see a dessert menu too as there wasn't one. 
Overall, an amazing delicious place and I highly recommend here!"}
{"text":"We returned to Marcello's after a day at Vaughan Mills, it was 300pm and they had a 30min wait. It was worth the wait for sure!!! Three orders of homemade pasta and a wood oven pizza, bread and drinks for $75.
You can't beat that!
We will be back"}
{"text":"This is my default Italian restaurant when I am in the area. I love the food here! I is always so busy and the restaurant is usually full. I highly recommend making reservations if you decide to come. The first time I came on a weekend, there was about a 45 min wait. 

Service: the service is friendly but it could be a bit slow at times. 

Food: I love the pasta and pizza items here. I usually order a different one when I'm here. The portions are generous as well. For appetizers, I usually stick to the fried calamari. The fried calamari is delicious here. It isn't too overly battered and it is well seasoned."}
{"text":"It was good, but not great. Server was very nice; the atmosphere was very loud and busy. Found the food good, but too salty so it lost a lot of flavour - it drowned everything else out. A good casual spot to check out."}
{"text":"This place is do busy for its own good. Went the last couple of times and the service was not the greatest.  The food is good but the lack of service makes for less then great dinning experience. They also should freshen up the menu. We also went with a friend with a food allergy and they would not accommodate him."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!  Ambiance is nice
Great family place for sure

Our server had the sense of humour as dry as paint on the wall from the 60's but I guess not everyone is meant to be funny LOL. He was very efficient though and he did a good job overall. 

Let's start with the pizza. Wow

Wood oven pizza cooked to perfection. Great ingredients and done right. We had 6 different ones and all of them were fantastic. 

Calamari.  We had them grilled and they were just alright. The fried ones are amazing. 

we also got a shrimp and calamari fry. Oh my God. Amazing

The antipasto platter with the olives and cold cuts and cheese was pretty small for $18 but then again for two people it's fine. 

We also ordered the linguini with fish in a red sauce. Great quantity of seafood and cooked just right. Sauce is a bit thicker than we prefer (closer to a tomato paste than sauce) but it was very tasty. 

The place was packed for a Tuesday night which speaks volumes.  It is a bit pricey but not outrageous. Budget $30 a person plus alcohol. 

All things considered I would come back again. Especially for the pizza. Awesome pizza. Loved every type we tried."}
{"text":"What's to say that hasn't been said before! Consistently great good with exceptional service. I'm not sure why anyone complains about the slow response here but I've been 5 times now twice with my toddler and we couldn't be happier.

The pizzas are fabulous so is the salad and the soup. Highly recommend the tiramisu, although there is no dirth of people selling it in Woodbridge only a few have mastered it as well as Marcello's.

Fantastic go to. No need to drive downtown to Librettos."}
{"text":"Went here once and I loved it! I would without hesitation go back here if I'm ever in the area. We came her in a Wednesday night an hour before they closed and the place was still very much busy.

The restaurant is very open spaced and you can also have a great view of the kitchen staff doing their thing. 

The size is pretty hefty and it really is a bang for your buck. My fiancé and I shared 1 pasta, 1 app and we were very satisfied! 

We asked the server for the recommendations and she suggested the seafood pasta with tomato sauce and the grilled calamari for the app. We loved them! The pasta was cooked al dente, the tomato sauce was seasoned perfectly, the shrimps were massive and juicy along with the mussels, calamari, and scallops! The appetizer was the best grilled calamari I've ever tasted!!!

The service was fast and friendly. Almost forgot to mention that they serve bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for your starters. 

Great Italian restaurant, definite must try"}
{"text":"One of the worst dinning experience . Nothing authentic about this place. Can't believe that I was dumb enough to line up almost an hour to dive into a dumpster of stale pasta, soggy salads, garbage \"imported\" Italian wine, bland pizza dough, and  possibly outdated balsamic vinegar. (I know you're thinking vinegar..., but it was by far the worst. Even your no name, presidents choice brands are far refined compare to the ones served there).
Please do yourself a favor and buy a jar of classico sauce + presidents choice pasta. You'll be happy you did it. 
 Service can't be blamed, but was mediocre. The main course is the food, but they've failed miserably in producing half decent Italian cuisine. I'm no top chef, but in comparison to Terroni's or Fraticelli's, this place  is very amateur. 

Hope who ever reads this think twice about wasting time, money, and quota at amateur restos like this. FYI, if you're really hungry after walking around Vaughan Mills, there is McDonald's near by that would give you a much more satisfactory experience than at Marcellos. 

Cheers,"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite Italian spots in Vaughan. The pizzas are to die for!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful pizza and pasta! I love the traditional Italian thin crust and fresh toppings. I always have a hard time choosing what I will get but it almost always ends up being the pizza because it is so delicious and satisfying. They have great options for pizza toppings and I never want to \"create my own\" because they ones they come up with are perfect flavours. I really like the feel of the restaurant as well with a big bar, wood burning oven and nice dim lighting in the evening. A lovely ambience overall! The wait staff are friendly and fast, even on busy nights. You can see they are always trying to move quickly and keep customers happy. 
I find myself wanting to go back here every time I am in Vaughan. A great place for a night out!"}
{"text":"I have been back to Marcellos at least 5 times since I wrote my original review. I have brought family, co-workers, friends, friends of friends, etc.

The rating still stands at a strong 5 stars. 

Staff have ALWAYS been amazing and the food is right up there with the service.

Whatever they're doing they're doing it right. Kudos to the owners and management."}
{"text":"They've got great pizza here. It's light and crusty, and the selection of topping combinations are really good. We had the Positano pizza and it was delicious. They've got hot oil on each table - which is quite spicy - and olive oil and balsamic. The coffee and tiramisu were also very good. I heard someone say that you can't go to Marcello's and not have the tiramisu, so of course we did. And we weren't disappointed. This location is always bustling, but that's because people keep coming back. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 for me. My fiancé and I were given a great recommendation to come here and it did not disappoint. We weren't looking for a big meal so we shared an appetizer and an entree. We started with the Calamari alla Griglia (Grilled) and it was absolutely delicious. You get large pieces of squid drizzled with olive oil and pesto sauce. It was perfectly cooked and probably the best grilled calamari we've ever had. For the entree, we shared  the Linguine di Mare, which was linguine pasta with shrimp, mussels, scallops and more calamari in a tomato sauce. The seafood was perfectly cooked as well as the pasta and the tomato sauce was very good. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients used and everything is made to order, so your dishes are piping hot when it is brought to the table. 

The servers were very friendly, made great suggestions and always made sure that our waters were filled. As much as we would've loved to have dessert, we will full but will definitely try some next time. The only thing that we would change was the complementary bread that they give to you, it was good but if it was served warm, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"When I am in the Vaughan Mills area, I skip the food courts and the restaurants in the mall and come here. 

Marcellos Vaughan Mills is an extension of the original location, located on St. Clair. Usually I come here with at least one other person; so we can split a pie and an appetizer or dessert later.


The food is pretty decent and fairly consistent. I really haven't had a bad experience here. The portions are pretty generous, if you're a small eater like me; normally I have always have take home, if I ordered my own food.

I'm not a fan of the pasta here, mostly because I've had better. Their pizza is pretty decent; although I've been here before Pizza Libretto (which is kinda unfair comparison). But you need to keep in mind that their pie won't be a soft, chewy toothsome crust like Libretto's then you'll be ok. I usually order their margherita or their positano or speck pizza; these are usually pretty good choices, although their positano pizza can get a bit salty due to the cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. 

Their appetizers are pretty good, my usual order is either their grilled veggie platter or their grilled calamari. Their Grilled calamari, like pretty much all their dishes, are great for sharing. Portion wise, I'd recommend this for at least 2-4 people, but I've been able to stretch this to 6 people in the past. It's got pretty decent flavour, if you add a squirt of the lemon on the side to cut the oil, you're golden.  Their grilled veggie platter is great for the same amount of people to share and is a great way to open up the appetite before your mains arrive.

Dessert is a definate yes but I recommend going  straight to the tiramisu; which is made in house. It's worth it and fairly light if you split it between your party.  It isn't terribly sweet, but it's melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Dang that's one spicy meatball!

If you want REALLY good Italian food, and your in the neighborhood, go here. The appetizers are great, the pasta is cooked to perfection, the pizza is thin and tasty and the meats are incredibly well cooked!

If you were wondering, the answer is yes, my fork went around the table and back in my mouth (it might have gone around the table twice actually).

It's a little on the pricey side, but if you can afford a lovely meal at a restaurant, and it needs to be Italian. Check it out."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Marcello's given it was a Thursday, raining, light traffic and no wait. The place was loosely full.

Our server was very friendly and helpful. Good with allergies. The restaurant was cozy, a bit dimly lit, and clean.

We shared the following and brought home lots of leftovers:
Nice bread to start
Burrata -always a favourite and this one did not disappoint. Delicious!
Pepperoni pizza - nice thin crust, good flavour.
Shrimp pasta - nice light olive oil pasta with tomato and arugula. Only failing was that it seemed to be missing salt altogether, and I say that as someone who does not want overly salted food. Huge portion.

No room for dessert even though the house made tiramisu sounded awesome."}
{"text":"Came across this place about a year ago and have been going at least once a week since  The food is fabulous, especially the pizza and the staff are so efficient and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great food and service.  My husband always gets the pasta in oil and garlic and raves about it.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place had exceeded my expectations for Italian food. 

Everything was amazing. The pasta, salad, appetizers, pizza... everything. 

Pricing is average. 

I highly recommend ordering a salad and splitting a small pizza between 2 people because I was over eating trying to finish my pizza. 

Come here if you're in the area, especially if you're tired and hungry from shopping!"}
{"text":"Went to Marcello's as a party of 10 last night and it was a great experience.  Unfortunately they do not take reservations on Sunday but we didn't have to wait long for our table.  The good thing about that was we were able to request a table of 10 before all of our party arrived.  Usually restaurants won't start prepping your table until everyone arrives.  This saved a bunch of time.  All in all we waited about 15 minutes for our table to be ready.  Our server was great; she was very attentive patient.  Ordered drinks first and ate the complimentary bread that was brought to our table.  Our apps came out and they were all very good sized portions.  The antipasto platter was massive; it can easily be shared by 3-4 people.  The arancini were great as well; very crispy and the subtleties of saffron were a nice touch.  The salads and bruschetta pizza were huge as well. After the apps, our mains came and again, very good sized portions.  Mainly pizza and pasta's were ordered at our table (and one veal parmigiana).  The mains were all very good.  The pizza was nice and crispy but still had some chewiness to it and the gnocchi was great and had a homemade feel to it.  Dinner was followed by espresso, cappuccino, coffee and one tiramisu (again the portion was huge).  All in all, Marcello's was a great experience.  Service was fast and friendly despite being really busy, even for a Sunday night.  I would highly recommend Marcello's for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, consistently delicious with  good prices, can't go wrong coming here unless there's a wait of over an hour, when they tell u half an hour its most often 15. 5 stars for service prices and quality"}
{"text":"Love everything we ordered. Place is really nice. Good place to spend dinner with family and friends. Wide variety of selection on Antipasti, pasta and pizza.

We had the Tonino, Cicco and Capricossa(not sure with spelling) pizzas. For pasta, we had the Fetuccine Alfonso (chicken and mushroom on cream sauce) and Linguinne di Mari(seafood with tomato cream sauce). Love love the pasta! 

Will surely come back to try the other choices in the menu."}
{"text":"Always busy always packed. Buzzing atmosphere certainly not a quiet place because it's always busy! Great for families and dates and celebrations. Fantastic pizzas. Their dough is very tasty and pizzas are prepared perfectly each time. 
I'd love them to do a Fungi pizza. 
Service is patchy at times with some servers being better and more attentive to others. Lucky draw.
Best part about his place is they know how to make and serve a proper expresso! EXCELLENCE!"}
{"text":"After walking around Vaughan Mills, I opened up my Yelp app to see what was around here.. my attempt to be adventurous.

There are a ton of Italian restaurants around this area.. so it was a really tough choice! I narrowed it down to Marcello's and upon following the map, we saw it tucked in a corner of one of the plaza's surrounding the mall.

We arrived just shy of 6PM and the restaurant was already pretty busy, we were seated right away. The restaurant itself is very bright as there are windows all along the store front; the vibe was very casual and cheery, a very family friendly place and great for get-togethers.

The menu offerings are typical to an Italian restaurant, we ordered a pizza ($15), penne ($13) and spaghetti ($15). We were served bread with oil & vinegar after ordering.

When our food came, I was surprised at how big the portions are. I would not say this is the best Italian restaurant I've been to but for the price, it is definitely the optimal combination of quality for what you pay for!

The service here is great, water was constantly refilled. Upon leaving, there were a lot of people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"I really like this place
The prices are quite affordable, especially when there are a lot more expensive places in the area
The portions are also quite large
I went with my boyfriend and we shared the calamari appetizer (deep fried), ceaser salad and pizza and had over half the pizza left over!
It was very tasty
It is usually quite full, which is also a good sign (we were there on a weekday for lunch and it was practically packed)
We both enjoyed it and have recommended it to many others!
Real, tasty Italian food!"}
{"text":"Ate here for a quick lunch, and admittedly did not order pizza as I was only a party of one plus a toddler and didn't think I'd be able to finish a pizza order by myself. Ordered a pasta dish, fettucini alfonzo. Was underwhelmed by the pasta and got a little bit of indigestion afterwards (possibly the porcini mushrooms are just too strong for me personally.)  I actually was more disappointed with the service than the food. The attitude of the waitress wasn't friendly and she had bit of an abrupt and slightly abrasive manner when taking the order and checking in on us. It made me wonder if that attitude presented itself because I was a solo diner with a child and deemed not worthy of solicitous service. (Child was well behaved so not the reason for the cold waitress attitude). The restaurant doesn't cater to families with young children (which I can understand just wanted to mention to other family Yelpers reading this) so will not have amenities like a kids' menu or plastic cups with lids. I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt in regards to food, as I understand this place is known for pizza, which I did not order. Also it was probably just a one-off incident with the waitress having a bad day. However, the dining experience I had will make me hesitate returning in the future."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this restaurant. I am always coming here with my coworkers for post work drinks and dinner. I have zero complaints about the food. I usually opt for the specials because they are unique and not seen on the menu. When the specials don't appeal to me, I find myself going to the ol' faithful Margherta Pizza. The price is reasonable and the portions are large. My gripe? They cannot separate the bills, they haven't an ATM and the service is unpredictable. Service is a big thing when it comes to being a regular patron but because the food is amazing, I will give it a 4/5. Service wise, 3/5."}
{"text":"3.5-4*, bumped up 'cause the prices are pretty decent.  Slightly higher than Vaughan Mills food court, but lower/on-par with Pickle Barrel or other restaurant inside the mall.  Serving sizes were also good, so pretty decent value overall!

Server wasn't the friendliest, but was efficient and did things without being asked, re:  offered a refill of bread, refilled water, brought bill as soon as asked.  This, considering the price, is beyond my expectation.

We ordered Primavera Pizza (~$13, thin crust) and Penne a la Vodka (just under $13, dry pasta).  There were a coupla pasta dishes that the server stated were made in-house, but the majority of them were made from dry pasta.  Pasta was good, very tasty, and cooked el dente!

I didn't order the pizza, but tasted it and it was ok.  A coupla toppings such as sundried tomatoes and olives were waaay too salty in my opinion, probably due to the brine.  I thought that this detracted from the actual pizza a bit.  Again, the pizza was a good size, leftovers for sure, but I'd probably order a different one the next time.

If & when you're at Vaughan Mills, this is definitely a better option than dining at the food court.  I'd definitely go back to try other things off their menu!"}
{"text":"All I can say is MMMMMMMMMM! I went for dinner with two others and we enjoyed all of the food. We had a salad to start (forgot which one) and the mussels. The broth the mussels were cooked in was to die for! We ordered two pizzas-vegetarian and spicy sausage, as well as the seafood pasta which our server told us was the best seller. Pizzas were delicious, and so was the pasta (a little aldente for my liking). Everything was great except for the loud hectic environment, a lot of kids running around, we could barely hear each other. We will be returning for lunch next time :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service and menu! The wait times could be long but the food is 100% worth the wait. The pizza is delicious if you're looking for wood oven quality pizza that isnt made in 2 seconds at pizza pizza  I haven't tried anything else other than the pizza but I'm sure everything else is great as well!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Marcello's Pizzeria (it's next to Vaughan Mills).

I love love love pizza and ordered one with pepperoni and cherry tomatoes.  It arrived really quickly.  The piizza was delicious.  The crust was thin and tasty.  There was lots of cheese, the cherry tomatoes exploded when I ate them and the sauce was good.

Lilly was my server and she took good care of me.

I'd go back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for Italian home cooking Marcellos is the place! The pasta is served piping hot and the atmosphere is just like being at home with your family. The staff is very friendly, the portions are huge, they are always busy, the food is fresh. I have been eating amazing italian food all of my life in Canada and in Italy therefore it's very difficult for me to be satisfied with finding the perfect italian restaurant. So trust me when I say that this place is Amazing. The Terra pizza and fettuccine al salmone are my favourite dishes."}
{"text":"After going to Vaughn Mills me and my parents decided to give this place a try. The restaurant was surprisingly busy and we had to wait about 35 minutes. When we got our table I ordered arancini, gnoochi, penne Alla vodka and the Cotto pizza. It was all pretty good. If you're planning to come get ready to wait, or go on a weekday and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The mussels were full of sand. The calamari was extremely salty and the gnocchi made me sad. Great service, terrible food. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I walked in expecting the over priced snotty and rude Italian restaurant way. I was HIGHLY wrong. I went with my wife and mother in law. We had an option of outside or inside it was a beautiful day so we took outside. The server came every few mins or so to refill our water to ask how everything was. They seemed fairly happy with their work. You got kind of a stink eye from the chefs in center of the place. But be on that the FOOD, I got a steak with vegetables. ($25) its average not bad its smothered in oil. But it didn't take away the taste. For the price there could of been more then like 5 vegetables half sliced. 

So to me:

Service 5
Food 4
Me : Pleased To Go Again"}
{"text":"I haven't had any chance to come back here but I can't stop craving for their pesto sauce. I've tried different Italian restaurants but none can make the sauce as good as them. *drooling*

I was here for a farewell party. This place was packed even though it was only 7PM. People were lining up outside despite the cold (it was during winter). The outside of the restaurant looks fancy and upscale but the atmosphere was warm, cozy and casual (a bit suffocated since it was so packed). 

My sister and I ordered Calamari Alla Grigila for starter. It's basically just grilled squid marinated with olive oil, lemon and basil pesto. (yummy pesto!!). It was amazing! My sister had pizza but I can't remember its name. The pizza was crunchy and the crust wasn't too thick. It was full with toppings and tasty.  I ordered Spaghetti al Pesto (grilled chicken, sundried tomatoes in pesto cream sauce). Can you tell how much I love their pesto?!? While waiting for our orders, we tried their fresh baked bread.

The price is reasonable for a nice, authentic (or close) Italian cuisine. The serving size is decent. 

It was super busy and packed. The service was quick but the staffs weren't very friendly. They may have a long day! But at least smile!

I walk by this restaurant everyday and it's always busy. ALWAYS! Even during lunch! During the summer they have the patio open as well. However, I will definitely find a chance to come back here again (not during the weekend tho). I love their pesto sauce! (but thinking about the lineup makes me feel frustrated)"}
{"text":"The salads had just the right amount of dressing, with just the right balance of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The chicken breasts were fresh off the grill, and very tender, juicy and plump. We enjoyed a basket of fresh bread with our meal which complimented our choices perfectly.  Our waitress was very friendly, courteous and timely. She never made us feel rushed to leave and encouraged us to chat and enjoy our time at their restaurant. We were definitely treated as guests.  I would highly recommend Marcello's Pizzeria as a destination to enjoy appetizing, organic, healthy food. Our salads were fresh and made to order. The prices were all very reasonable and the atmosphere relaxed, with an at-home ambience; creating an ideal destination for a lunch date or a leisurely evening out for dinner. Marcello's Pizzeria is a restaurant I would recommend to friends and would return to myself."}
{"text":"This location needs to be shut down. I came tonight for my birthday and the waitress got my drink order and food order wrong. We requested a manager come to the table 4x and the owner laughed it off. Manager did not apologize until bill was paid and did not seem to care. The owner was rude and didn't seem to care that we will never return. I am turned off forever. The st.clair location is a million times better."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants we have been to.! Ambience is definitely spot on for a cozy family dinner.  For pastas, we had the White wine Tomato based Seafood pasta, Linguine di Mare & Creamy Fettuccine Alfonzo ( porcini mushrooms, chicken and baby arugula in a garlic cream sauce - boom! you could not get any better than that) . For pizzas my personal favourite was Tonino , it's simple cheese , prosciutto, basil and cherry tomatoes . Nothing great right ? Wait til you take a bit of the pizza and have the cherry tomatoes explode its juiciness in your mouth  !introducing all the flavours.  wOw!! What an experience . The more complicated pizzas would pale in comparison because all I can think of is this pizza . Can't wait to come back and sample the rest of the menu. 

There is a line up so be sure to call in for a reservation . We were lucky.. when we called they said a longer wait give or take 30min but when we got there , we were seated right away . Service was good (just a bit slow or I was just hungry) but they kept us at bay with appetizer bread. Their spicy oil was soooo good . Wanted to take some home ."}
{"text":"If you are in Vaughan, you know you are going to be getting a case of \"Itis\" after whatever meal you eat! This place is extremely busy and it should be, especially from the delicious food that they serve! I don't know how the italians do it, but they truly mastered the art of making pasta! The pasta is cooked to perfection and the sauce is bursting with flavours. Portions are very generous and the price is very reasonable. The servers are very friendly and makes you feel at home. A great atmosphere and a great place to go for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Went out with collegues and had a great time.  The waitress was very helpful with suggestions for shared appetizers and the food arrived in a timely manner.  The calamari was light and crispy not overly battered and the olive paste toast with fresh cheese was so delicious.  I ate the whole plate and that's just the appetizer.  The portions and overall presentation of the dishes that arrived on the table looked fantastic.  Thoroughly enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Had a amazing dinner here with my family. This is the only Italian restaurant I go to when I want great pizza and pasta. There calamari here tasted so fresh, I feel like they get it fresh every day. 

The pizza is a thin crust oven wood style. My fave one would be the Diavola pizza. Overall it's always a great time coming here but make sure you call ahead to make reservation on weekdays because it could get busy fast. They don't take reservation on weekends."}
{"text":"We arrived here on a thursday night just abit before 6.  The place wasn't busy yet, so we got our seats right away.  When we left around 7:30pm, there were already a line up at the door.  Its pretty spacious inside, see alot of families and huge groups.

We ordered a salad, linguini di mare, pizza di parma to share.  The pasta was amazing, cooked perfectly.  I personally love wood oven pizza, they did a great job on it.  The roasted garlic is a great touch to the pizza.  Because this is a white pizza, i find it alittle dry for my liking. We also finish the meal off with their house made tiramisu, not too heavy or sweet, love it. 

Anna, our waitress, amazing lady! She is funny, attentive, and very patient with us!! A+ for her wonderful service for sure."}
{"text":"They simply do it right, at least when it comes to pizza. I had the Pizza Mia and it was the perfect crust loaded with just the right combination of topping. It left me more satisfied than a Victoria Secret fashion show attendee."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and would go more except that sometimes the hangriness kicks in and I can't be patient and wait for a table on their busy nights..

Everything I've had from here is delicious. Caprese salad, vodka penne, calamari but the two items I'm addicted too are their rice balls and their pizza. 

Ugh the rice balls are so crispy and cheesy and sit in an amazing tomato sauce. Me and my bf fight over these they're so good.

Their pizza crust is perfect..It's crispy and chewy. 

This place is a must try but since it's close to the mall they can get super busy on Fridays and around 9 when everyone is done shopping."}
{"text":"The good: the pizza! The pizza that I tried was the pizza alla campagnola which was sooo delicious. Yeah they make pretty good pizza here and probably one of the best I've tried. The service is also nice and friendly. 

The bad: I ordered the insalata di arugula. I highly don't recommend getting the salad. It was $14 and nothing special except arugula with a few walnuts and goat cheese. I love salad and this was pretty disappointing. I guess this is why it's called a pizzeria. 

All points go to the pizza. No stars for the salad."}
{"text":"You can tell the owners are cheap as F***.  It's the only Italian place in Ontario that will charge you for refills on bar coke.  The coke is from the bar taps and was flat.  The rule of thumb is if you do charge for refills i would expect bottle or canned coke not bar coke.   I over heard people next to me also talking about paying for refills.   The glass is also very small and packed with ice.  Huge rip off.  
The coke is awful. Order water only.  

They just changed the pizza. It used to be the best pizza but due to cut backs a margarita pizza now has half as much cheese and comes in thick blogs.    

I didn't like how my free bread came when my meal came out.  The bread should come out right away when I order.  

I used to be a huge fan of this place but you can tell it is going down hill.   I checked out a few other places in the area they all over coke in the can and they do not charge for refills."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The staff seemed a bit obnoxious at times but overall a good experience with amazing food and I will be going back for more hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I have been living in Vaughan for 10 years and have not heard of this place until recently and I am kicking myself for it. I tried their vegetarian pizza and being a pizza lover, I can honestly say that it was the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life. Better than dominos and pizza hut. It was just so flavorful, fresh and authentic. I am not one to write boasting reviews like this so that alone should give you an indicator of how good the pizza was. My friends had pasta which looked amazing. I will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here after a day of shopping at Vaughan Mills. My friend raved about this restaurant and insisted we ate there. The host told us it would be a 60 minute wait! That's a ridiculous amount of time and we were all pretty hungry. We still left our name and number and walked out to decide on other options. Our friend assured us she's never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table. True enough, we got a call 15 minutes later saying our table was ready. It was packed both inside and on the patio. The aroma of freshly baked bread filled the room. You can see the stone oven where they do the baking from our table and everything was made in house. 

The bread was really fresh and unlimited so it's easy to fill up on that. I had to refrain myself from doing so. We placed our orders and it came out really quickly despite how busy the restaurant was. Had to order a pizza because the aroma was irresistable. It was pretty thin, which made it hard to eat with the heavy chunks of artichokes on it. Delicious nonetheless. Tried a bit of my friends pasta and it was equally as good. Just the right proportion of sauce to pasta ratio. I'm no expert on Italian cuisine but this felt pretty close. The food was really good and the environment was nice and rustic. 

Excellent for vegetarians as well. Server wasn't friendly, barely said a word to us but she was efficient. Memorized all four orders including modifications and allergies without problems and our waters were refilled twice despite how busy it was. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had dining out. Read great reviews so decided to try this place out. Was prepared for a long wait time because I had read a few reviews mentioning this, but this was ridiculous. Took 45 mins from ordering to receive and appetizer. Another 40 mins to get our pizza. Waitress came to our table once during the hour and a half we spent waiting to get me another drink (20 minutes after I had finished it).
Pizza was okay, no where comparable to the other pizza places I've been to in Woodbridge or toronto.
Would not come again, wouldn't recommend to ANYONE.
Also, no refills on pop drinks!"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to eat Italian out, my standards are a little high because my husband is Italian and I've been spoiled with him and his mum's cooking. I've also eaten many wonderful dishes in Italy. Buy after hearing more than one friend rave about Marcello's I was hopeful enough to give it a shot. 

I was over the moon to see they had arancini on the menu, I haven't had a good arancino besides the ones my husband makes since I was in Sicily. And turns out I still can't find one that even comes close to authentic. These were below average. They were just small fried rice balls with some marinara sauce. True Italian arancini is bigger because it's full of beautiful ragu and saffron rice. These will just bland and sad. 

I was still hopeful for main, they have tortelloni on the menu! What came was not tortelloni. Tortellini is not the same thing as tortelloni, it's smaller. What I got was tortellini that could have been olivieri and a standard tomato cream sauce. I could have made better at home, and my husband is the better home cook. 

Overall I gave Marcello's a 3 star because my friend's pizza was good, still not the best in the GTA but it was better than my meal."}
{"text":"This review of Marcellos Pizzeria is based on my dining experience with a vegetarian. 

I usually just let my Hot yoga Date picks where we go for dinner as I am an eat whatever and she is a vegetarian. 

Italian seems to be good choice as there's always meatless pizza and meatless pasta...so we ended up at Marcellos.

On a Tuesday night, there's still a short wait for a table... but always a good sign as at least one have hope that the place has to be good. 

Pizza Primavera ($12.95) Tomato sauce, mozzarella, pesto, sundried tomatoes, onions, green olives & green peppers, which we really enjoyed... eyeing each other to see who was going to have the last slice.

Gnocchi al Pomodoro ($10.95) was a little disappointingly bland with just tomato sauce..... me thinking about Linguine Frutti di Mare ($16.95) while chewing on those tasteless Gnocchi

Tiramisu ($ 4.95) saved our evening. Great portion for sharing, nothing better to bond with your friend while fighting over a great dessert.

I think I would have to come back with another date so I can do an update that is not bias...."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. The food was a 4.5-5 however there was a couple mishaps which lowered the score. 

The best way to embrace warm weather is eating a great meal on a patio. After a long and gruesome winter, I was excited to make plans for dinner on Marcello's patio.

I called at 4:30pm on a Wednesday and was told they were not taking reservations... Their website stated they had a no-reservation policy for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Again, this was on a Wednesday.

There were 20 different  pizza options and they all seemed delicious. Our server provided great insights about personal, and customer favourites. I choose the Ciccio pizza (number 17). It had spicy olive oil (instead of tomato sauce), rapini, chicken, mozzarella, asiago and red peppers. The cost was $14.95 and it was well worth it! 

I asked for two separate bills as I had ordered wine and a started salad and my guest had not. The bill arrived as one with no explanation from our waitress. It wasn't until I read previous yelp reviews that I learned that this restaurant does not split bills. The \"no split bills\" policy is a inconvenience for any patron at any restaurant. While I understand that it can slow down service it puts the guests at a disadvantage trying to figure out how to correctly split a bill (which wouldn't be too easy after a couple glasses of wine!).

Overall, this was a good restaurant. There were some minor \"policies\" I disagreed with but my pizza was excellent, the server was courteous and I was intrigued by the many options on the menu."}
{"text":"I have lived in Woodbridge for almost 10 years now and have never been here!
WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING WITH MY LIFE!?
It's like icecream patio but way better service and more food!

I love my pasta with tones of parmesan! 
This place killed it!
We also ordered a bruschetta looking \"pizza\" it was BOMB! 

If your in the area drop by! I know it's very busy during the evenings so make reservations !!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner after reading some of the great reviews on Yelp! We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday night (they don't take reservations on weekends) and put our name down. There was a lineup to get in, but it was only 10 minutes before we were seated. Not bad!

We ordered the fried calamari, the pasta special (rotini with mushrooms, chicken, and light cream sauce), and the pizza al pollo. The fried calamari was very good. It's quite a large plate for 2 and could easily accommodate 4. The pizza was also very good, though it had a thinner crust than I usually prefer. The pasta was good as well. We were stuffed at the end of the evening, with food left to bring home, but I continued to eat some more of the pasta while at the restaurant.

The restaurant is very noisy, especially when other tables bring their kids. It's a great place to bring your family, but not a great place to bring a date."}
{"text":"Came here twice now. Had lunch here today and ordered the gnnochi pasta with the tomatoe cream sauce and it was delicious. The portion sizes are great. My friend had the fantasia pasta with mushrooms instead of chicken and she loved the flavours too. The servers were all so friendly and they were accommodating to the fact that we had a baby stroller with us and sat us at a table that had room for the stroller. Overall, no complaints!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I've been in this restaurant a number of times and nothing to complain about. Pasta are fresh, pizzas perfect and sauce are really good!  Loved it"}
{"text":"After a day of shopping at Vaughan Mills, we stopped by Marcello's Pizzeria for dinner. There was quite a crowd of people at the door waiting for seats, but luckily we only had to wait for 20 minutes. Shopping makes me extremely hungry!

In addition to the usual olive oil and balsamic vinegar, Marcello's also provides chili oil, which made me very, very happy. I love spicy food, so I was literally pouring chili oil onto everything I was eating that night. Perhaps not the healthiest thing to do...

Now onto the food!

Fried calamari (frittura di calamari) with a side Caesar salad. I enjoyed this immensely. The calamari was lightly battered and nicely seasoned, which was good since it wasn't accompanied with any dips. We ended up using the Caesar dressing as a dip, and that also worked really well. The portion was also quite generous, perfect for sharing.

Barese: white pizza with mozzarella, Italian sausage, rapini, and hot peppers. I enjoyed the thin crust and the general cheesiness of the pizza, but I wasn't crazy about the rapini. Overall, a pretty good pizza.

Penne alla Vodka: penna pasta with leeks and pancetta served in a vodka tomato cream sauce. This was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend, in particular, was so in love with it that he craved it for the rest of the week. The pasta was cooked al dente, and that vodka tomato cream sauce was simply delectable! I wanted to smother everything in the sauce, including the bread and pizza crust. A drizzle of chili oil and a spoonful of Parmesan cheese were the perfect additions. 

Tiramisu- the cake was a little too soft and soggy for my liking, but I was told that authentic tiramisu tends to be on the softer side. I actually prefer a firmer cake, but did appreciate that it wasn't overly sweet.

Caramel crunch- I recognize this as a Dufflet creation. I particularly enjoyed the combination of crunchy and creamy textures. It was a fantastic end to the meal. 

All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Marcello's Pizzeria. I highly recommend this restaurant as a great affordable dining option near Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"Love their marguerita pizza and penne alla vodka. Prices are great and portions are just right! Make reservations or get there as soon as they open, it's a very popular spot."}
{"text":"One of the staff is very rude! The pizza is not good too. I don't want to give any star. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"Friendly and Spacious . The food , the decor and the price are all great .
I loved their appetizers . As for food , I just tried the pizza which was good enough . If you're out with your kids and family , this is a great place . Nice and classy for adults and comfortable enough to have your kids with you ."}
{"text":"Not a traditional Italian restaurant but some of there food is very good I am hooked on there linguini di mare. There fried calamari is very soggy wouldn't recommend it. Best tirimisu I have ever had at a restaurant so far. Sometimes the service is very good sometimes not so good. Depends on the server. Very good priced and the portions are very good."}
{"text":"I have been to this place nearly 10 times over the past six months and have never had a bad experience. The atmosphere is relaxed and not uptight. From the hostesses to the wait staff and the chefs, all are extremely friendly and can offer you recommendations when ordering. 

The food is bountiful in portions and very reasonably priced. Plenty of choice for every palate. Their wood oven pizza is delicious with a thin crust with a slight chew. 

Everyday there is a salad, pasta, pizza special so there is constantly a different taste for what you're up for. 

In Vaughan, there are many choices to choose from. However, one visit you will realize there is no reason to go anywhere else. 

This past visit I had the lobster tail risotto, with bay scallops, spinach, cherry tomatoes, in a garlic sauce. Excellent flavour and excellent value for $23.00."}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather when we went here so I just had a minestrone soup and my husband had the pizza.  The soup itself was very flavourful and didn't taste like it was dumped from a can like other restuarants. It tasted quite fresh. The pizza was beautifully baked and I did try a slice. Thin crust, fresh toppings, the cheese wasn't \"chewy\" (I'm really picky about the cheese being a cheese lover). A group of 12 friends accompanied us and the restuarant was able to accommodate our group and got the order right with little to no errors, which is often not the case with large groups. Our server was great! He was polite, enthusiatic and very quick. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Foods good, but it is always very loud, seems like patrons and servers are always  yelling....  staff is not as friendly as the St Clair location in Toronto... I want to enjoy my meal, and not be rushed out, we would have had dessert if the server hadn't slapped the bill on our table half way through our meal...."}
