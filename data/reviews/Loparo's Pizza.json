{"text":"I ordered from them on a Friday night. I live in the city and love pizza so wanted to try them out. Yuck!!! I order cheese fries with bacon... They were under cooked. I could have made better at home. Plus, something crunchy and nasty tasting was in them as well. The pizza I ordered was defiantly sub-par. I paid for onions so I expected to get my money's worth. I will never order from them again. Not worth the $$$ for sure.  I hate trashing a  business so close to home. But think that other individuals should be forwarned. Btw, my husband was going to get mcdonalds which would have costed much less than I spent for this crap. I wish I would have let him. Would have tasted better. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the thin crust pizza here. It is my favorite. I also like some of the subs that I have tried especially the meatball sub. I like my pizza and subs cook well done and when I request it, there is no issue on them honoring my request. If you want good Italian eats, pay a trip here!"}
{"text":"This place has some really nice zza.  I have only had pizza by the slice, and every time it was spot on.  This is one of the few where i will actually eat the crust.   

This place also has super friendly service. Determinately a mom and pop feel.  The owner was super friendly and he let me know that the sauce and dough is made from scratch."}
{"text":"damn it .. was too good to be true that this place would re-open .. sign said \"closed due to vandalism .. re-open ASAP\" .. yet it appears that will not happen .. that sucks .. was a great alternative to chain pizza in the area"}
