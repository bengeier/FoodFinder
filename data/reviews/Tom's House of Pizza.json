{"text":"Hubby and I had pizza...crust was only good thing about it.  Lacking cheese of almost any sort and toppings were huge and not bite size at all.  The server was attentive overall, but she was also doing a shot with patrons at the bar, which is illegal and could get them shut down.  It's not attracting a professional or young crowd either.  We are 35 and were by far the youngest people there.  It was on the pub side of the restaurant, but that doesn't make up for bad pizza."}
{"text":"I just called at about 1030 tonight. I ordered a Greek with ham. The man on the phone told me that they usually won't do a delivery for a small pizza. I told him that's fine I'm ordering a large anyway. He then asked how I would pay and cut me off to say that if I was going to pay with credit then he would need to take down all my credit information over the phone. I told him I would pay in cash. I then asked that the driver please bring change. He said OK change for a 50. I replied by saying no just change for a 20. He told me sir your order is 30$ you NEED change for a fifty. I let it slide because I'm hungry but I thought he was rude personally. I love the pizza here it's alright but the service needs improvement. I order here because its two blocks away and the delivery shouldn't take long but I could order from wherever I like there's lots of options in the city."}
{"text":"Pizzas are smaller then normal and not very good in my opinion. My fiance said it was one of the worst pizzas she's had in a while. A little overpriced with no deals. Overall unhappy with this pizza."}
{"text":"Now THIS is what pizza is supposed to be! Thin, crisped to perfection crust, topped with hot gooey cheese & really delicious toppings, Tom's is my choice for pizza in the city. Personally I love their pepperoni, green pepper and mushroom pizza, but it's all good."}
{"text":"Decent place for pizza. IMHO it's a step above all the chains such as Domino's or Panago... but not in the same league as the authentic Italian thin crust ones made in a wood burning oven. 

It's mainly a serve-yourself kind of place for a quick meal. You go up to the till to order and then when the order's ready, they'll call out your name.
It's similarly priced to all the chains.. so I'd eat here because the pizza is pretty good.. the thin crust was nice and crisp and the toppings were pretty generous and fresh."}
{"text":"Tom House House of Pizza has some of the best Pizza in the city! The staff is amazing and friendly! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Have been to a couple of the locations.....Macleod Trail has a nice weekend by he slice thing ...but James McKevitt location has great friendless staff...good food etc"}
{"text":"I live in Edmonton having moved from Lethbridge in 1966. During 1967 to 1971 on visits back to Lethbridge we used to time our trips to stop at Toms MacLeod Trail branch for pizza. I haven't had a better pizza since those days anywhere else. My visits back to Lethbridge are far fewer now, but we still make it a point to stop there as we will tomorrow (July 31, 2013)."}
{"text":"Good food for an unassumeing strip mall location. Most service is takeout I would imagine.

Both kids love the pizza at Toms and at least twice a week they will ask to go..."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! A pizza I can eat and enjoy! By far the best pizza I've had since I've moved from Ontario 2 years ago! Calgarians, this is what good delicious pizza tastes like!"}
{"text":"A long time ago when I was a child living in Toronto, there used to be a place called Pizza Pizza where they would sell pizza by the slice( with a variety of toppings) and you can order drinks and actually sit down and eat. In 11 years, I suppose that these places have pretty much vanished. There are almost no places that serve smaller portions with dine in areas besides Pizza Hut, and the closest Pizza Hut in Mindapore have now turned into a daycare. I wonder if these kids who go there eat pizza everyday, or if Pizza Hut is now catering exclusively for them? Most other franchises only have take out and delivery. This place in my mind preserves some old charm, as they sell pizzas in individual sizes. This is better than pizza by the slice because my dad and I ordered two different pizzas and we could share. For little kids, there are crayons behind the pop machine and colouring books available. I flipped through the colouring books, and to no surprise, the majority of the pages are already coloured in, and the kids didn't bother to take their artwork with them! Nevertheless, what kid doesn't like free  colouring pages? I mean as a 90s baby a.k.a pre iPad addiction baby, these were my life! I'm sure there are some empty pages.  They also have pop with free refills in reusable  hard plastic( better if they are glass but oh well I'd give them credit) cups. Now, this is another old charm that I like, similar to A&Ws. To me, pop is best served in a clear reusable cup so that you can see the drink inside, makes it look more refreshing. The fast food paper cups are lame. The pizza, don't expect this to be fast food, because he makes each pizza individually, but it's fairly quick and there's a Red Sox game on TV and music for entertainment. The pizza is thin crust, all their pizzas are thin crust and the salami and green pepper was pretty good. Only problem was that almost all the green pepper fell onto the metal plate underneath( they serve it on a plate, not a box unlike Coco Brooks). My dad ordered a 5 topping pizza and most of the veggie toppings fell off too. There was an option for a 6 or more topping individual pizza, I am almost afraid to imagine how that would turn out.. maybe only the pepperoni and cheese would stay on... Overall the atmosphere was decent, and by the way there's a really funny ad in the women's bathroom, what is it you ask? Too embarrassed to say, go check it out for yourselves ladies. No, it's not period supplies or birth control, if it was then I wouldn't be afraid to admit it, it's something way more sensitive.  I would dare them to put the ad in the men's washroom and see the reaction. Would they die of laughter or get angry? I don't know, maybe both. There's also a less embarrassing funny sign outside. It said \" Self service unless you are over 80 AND accompanied by your parents\""}
{"text":"Okay, so my family and I walked into this location today at around 4:29 P.M. Their wasn't anyone else in the restaurant, except for a guy with a mustache and a baseball cap on. 
No one was to be seen, to serve us. We were about to walk out of the restaurant, when a young guy just walked to the front. 
He told us to sit anywhere, and that's what we did. We noticed that on the paper placemats, it said \"please place your order at the counter. When we decided on what to order, we went o the counter. 
The guy working there, asked what we wanted to drink and we said water would be good for now. 
He put 4 glasses on the table, after we sat down and proceeded to tell us where to get our water. 
I guess I didn't realize it was a self serve restaurant. 
Then we realized that the guy sitting at the front, the one with the mustache, and baseball cap was actually a delivery driver. 
WHY didn't he tell us where the guy that was working there was ?
Anyways, the pizza was okay, and from reading what other people were saying in their reviews about the friendly service. I guess this was one of their OFF nights."}
{"text":"Great food and service! May not be the busiest all the time, but no matter what, you will have a great time here and feel comfortable as ever! Another great thing about Toms is that they are consistent with their hours, so if it is slow by chance.... They do not close early! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and prompt delivery. How ever the delivery driver gave pizza, took cash payment,counted payment then left about 3 minutes later the driver came back to the door saying we were $20. 00 short, we paid him even though we knew he counted. As he drove off I took the flash light to my driveway and found the 20 that he dropped. So from a 5 to 3. Great work driver."}
{"text":"I ordered a Vegetarian pizza without onions & with extra cheese (extra charge) for pick-up.  When I got home, I discovered the crust was burnt around the edges, NO extra cheese & some of the veggies weren't cooked.  Big chunks of almost raw green pepper, mushroom & tomatoes with luke warm black olives.  Very disappointing.  (I think they've changed ownership because the pizza didn't resemble anything I'd received before & I didn't recognize the fellow at the counter.)"}
{"text":"Tom's makes a great pizza. I've been to 3 of the locations, and have to say that the McKevitt location is by far the nicest and newest (some of the other locations are seedy dive bars). Get the Mexican pizza, it's AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"My heart broke a little when I found out that I was allergic to gluten, but not because I had to say goodbye to toast, sandwiches or baked goods, but because I had to say goodbye to Tom's House of Pizza pizza.

I'm with Dinah G. when she says that she finds just about any excuse to eat at Tom's House of Pizza. I'm right there with her. Anytime, any day, any reason. It's *that* good.

The toppings are some of the freshest you'll ever taste, and the prices please your wallet as much as the flavour pleases your palette.

I may not be able to eat pizza crust anymore, but I still go to Tom's just so I can order a pizza and pick the cheese and toppings off. Sacrilegious you say? I'm sorry, you must have mistaken me for someone who cares ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible service and such a mediocre pizza. Their prices are extremely high for its quality and size. I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"We wanted to try Varsity Pizza today but they were closed? At 5pm on a Sunday too so will have to check into that... but this cancellation led us to this location of Tom's. We had not yet been to this Centre St NE spot.
Inside was cool, dim and comfortable. No need to dress up here, come as you are! The friendly staff will make your experience a good one. Take a seat in the mostly all booth area (we were not on the bar side) and choose your za from the paper menus on the table, then order at the counter. You help yourself to the pop of water and your pizza will be delivered to your table for you.
The toppings were fresh on my personal sized veggie, yay! (one of my pet peeves is canned mushrooms that some other places still insist on using, grrr!) 
The pizza was also the perfect size for me and I feel for just under $12, it was good value.
I asked for pizza sauce on the side - I wish the sauce had not come ice cold. The other thing is - and it is a personal thing - is that as much as I love thin crust, it  was a bit too crispy for my liking. I know, it is supposed to be like that and it certainly would not prevent me from coming back here. I also liked the light cheese on top, it was so not greasy!
I agree with another reviewer who commented that this place draws an older type crowd but it meant for a deliciously quiet, stress-free meal!
Under $25 for 2 small pizzas and a diet coke."}
{"text":"Tom's House of Pizza, we can cross this one of our list now! We tried it and loved it! A little noisy, very kid friendly and there were lots of kids... but we were there for PIZZA and not atmosphere (nor a beer).Walked in, grabbed a seat wherever we wanted and we noted that we ordered at the counter. The place was clean enough and one has to rise above the 80's decor. Maybe that is part of the charm... The pizza was cooked to order, took a bit of time but when it was served to us, it was sooo worth the wait The crust (I do not think they have whole wheat) was perfect. So thin the way I like it with that soft crunch - you pizza lovers all know what I am talking about. YUM. The toppings were so fresh. I got a veggie pizza and my friend got a ham and tomato pie. Both deelish and the cheese is boasted to be CDN fresh! ASK for some buffalo hot sauce on the side for dipping. That too made the pizzas near perfect. Next time we would grab the pizza for take out - I can see us being regulars here even though we live a thousand kms across the city. Decent service, one never feels rushed here.  Parking, no prob in large, private lot. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Im giving 2 stars for the simple reason we are in a snow desert and the delivery man was enthusiastic. By appearance, I thought the pizza had a chance. However, who do they think they are fooling with the crust? Frozen......just like the weather. The sauce.....red but eating the color itself may have more flavor. And my flat mate wanted wings, simply disgusting......perhaps they were boiled or steamed? My favorite happens to be boiled chicken....not so much. It used to be a Calgary icon but now you can find better pizza in your grocer's frozen department."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Thin and crispy crust with just the right amount of toppings.  They are easy on the cheese which is nice, so each slice isn't as heavy and you are not left with that greasy taste on your mouth.  Decor is plain and service is simple.   

Note: there are only a few parking spots in the plaza, but you can park next door at the gas station."}
{"text":"Tom's. Two stars. What on earth?
I've given Tom's numerous chances - I used to enjoy their pizza.  It was THE pizza when I was growing up, but something has happened over the years.  I thought that at first that I just got a bad order, but three bad pizzas in a row - over a period of 6 years?
Obviously I don't order a lot of take out pizza, but when it is this disappointing, why would I bother?
Maybe in 2 years time they'll be better?..."}
{"text":"Great late night option for pizza.  I was visiting the area and wanted some pizza late at night.   I ordered a small pepperoni and mushroom pizza.   I phoned Tom's House of pizza and ordered a small for $11.30.   I was literally in shock when I saw how small the pizza was.......I live in the states and its the size of a pizza we call \"personal.\"    A pizza this size would run $6 in the states.  I was absolutely shocked at the price for the pizza.  I gobbled the pizza in no time flat.  I'm finding everything here in Calgary is expensive though.  It's REALLY expensive but they do do pizza and do it well."}
{"text":"Review #20 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

Tom's House of Pizza is an institution that's been around a long time (40ish yrs).  My first boss in Calgary told me about it (or rather raved) and then later introduced me to Tom's Pizza on (Macleod Trail location).

More recently we decided to try out this location for something different....or rather it was me saying \"pizza again can we try a new pizza joint?\"!!   We brought the kids and were able to walk in and sit down in a big booth.  The place is clean and the guys behind the counter friendly and helpful.

We ordered a couple different pizzas (varied tastes in our family) and it was relatively inexpensive all things considered.  The pizza's came out within 15 minutes of our ordering and were exactly as I remembered...toppings on top, cheese on the bottom.  One of our pizza's was pepperoni and there was a ton of it....you definitely taste the topping's on these pizza's.  The pepperoni was just a bit spicy for the kids but it wouldn't deter us from coming back and trying something new.  We enjoyed the crust as well since it is thin and crispy.

If you are up for trying something a little different try out Tom's.  Yummy."}
{"text":"How did I celebrate my birthday last year? I got my friends and relatives to come over, they had to wear birthday hats, go bowling and have Tom's house of pizza.  This is officially one of my favourite foods in Calgary to date so to have it for my birthday says so much.  

The Macleod Trail location has been there since the 70s, but the fresh pizza goodness has not changed at all.  The prices are so great for the freshest ingredients I have had ever had on a pizza.  The pizza is freshly made and baked right there for you to witness and I believe the drinks are bottomless, but I will have to revisit the pizzeria to find this out for you.  

But any reason to go there is incentive for me to go back to eat more."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we're in the back of an ambulance after eating Tom's House of cardboard Pizza tonite! Lack of flavor and salt sent us into a tailspin of low-sodium which required hospitalization thereafter. Followed by a high intake of TUMS re-freshers. Five years ago my girlfriend was forced under duress and pure hunger to eat at this joint. It was a late night and we were desperate, so we thought what the heck! Sadly I had my intuitions! Let me save you the trouble and the hassle and the $23.95! That we spent on a 12 inch large pizza-Are you serious? 12 inches for a large pizza that's a small in New York! 

Anyways my strong suggestion or recommendation is to pass this place up and keep on trucking! By the way if you're really desperate there's a Wendy's and a Denny's about 500 m just down the road! 

But I'm a let you in ON a little secret-the best place to go for food in Calgary is Moti Mahal!  yummmmmmy! Hands down! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of bringing a New Yorker to eat this pizza.  I'll never forget the look on his face when he first tasted it. Like there was a bug in his mouth. And it's true.

I remember it being kind of good. At least I thought it was. I ate here a few years ago for a late night bite. We were starving. Maybe that's why I thought it was OK. 

But it really doesn't have taste. There's no rich tomato sauce, delicious juicy veggies or fresh oregano or even real cheese. It's all kind of processed here. Ingredients seem cheap. Also was odd that the pizza was made so quickly. I think perhaps we are so used to mediocre ingredients and quality of food here in Calgary some actually think this place is good?

I wish pizza joints in Calgary would kick it up a notch and it doesn't have to be gourmet it just has to be fresh and delicious. What's wrong with that? 

Besides the food I think the restaurant itself is charming. If you're starving maybe go for it? Personally I think .. just go home put some real cheese on a slice of bread. Put that in the oven and enjoy. It'll be better."}
