{"text":"Let me start off by saying this WAS my favorite Mexican spot in las Vegas. I drive from Southern Highlands just for the Pastor tacos! Usually I go late night but today I went in around 5 ish. Was greeted by the kitchen employees and when they asked what I wanted I nicely replied with \"I need a few minutes\". This man I never seen working there before said in Spanish a rude remark back to his coworkers about me saying I'm not ready yet. I was so offend, and he totally ruined my appetite so I left without ordering anything. Horrible experience for a loyal customer."}
{"text":"TL;DR: a simple, well-executed menu leads me to fantastic food. Would highly recommend.   My car's air conditioner is, for the moment, unfortunately broken- poor timing as our typical triple-digit temperatures have begun. It, however, does come with an upside: it lead to my discovery of Taco Tijuana. As I was driving past, a delicious smell wafted into my car through my open windows. Thus enticed, I made a stop. The menu is pleasingly simple: two meats(Carne Asada, Al Pastor), three dishes(tacos, quesadillas, mulitas). The food was very quick, the service pleasant, and the environment clean. The carne was tender and moist, and the pastor was obviously well marinated and freshly sliced, tangy and juicy. They had two sauces on the table, starting with a medium heat salsa. (Tomatillo/roasted chili, I think? Was honestly too busy with rapidly consuming tacos and wasn't really paying attention, but it did have a great, vaguely vegetal green flavor, balanced with a hint of smokiness and a mild kick.) It was smooth enough to be dispensed copiously via squirt bottle but with enough texture to provide a pleasing contrast to the creaminess of the guacamole used on the tacos. Finishing off the roster is a roasted chile hot sauce, bringing a deep red, earthy punch, almost nutty with a decent amount of heat. And that's it. No large, complicated menu, no gimmicks. Just really good food at a very reasonable price. Seriously, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Taco TJ's Al Pastor tacos are really good. Thin slices of pineapple would make them even better but they're really good without. Their Carne Asada was alright. No \"wow\" factor there. The Al Pastor is where it's at.   If you're not a fan of LOTS of raw onion, ask for it on the side. I'm a fan of it but even I thought it was a bit much. You've been warned.   Like other reviewers have mentioned, a salsa bar would be nice but they do have lime wedges and sliced radishes available for the taking. However, you do get salsa on your tacos and a side of grilled onions (yes, more onions) & peppers.   The BF and I got a plate of Al Pastor and Carne Asada, each for $9.99 and they came with a couple packets of hot tortillas. We went the DIY taco route. I'll be back for another fix soon."}
{"text":"Delicious hand-made corn tortillas! The Carne Asada was ok but the Al Pastor was the bomb! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the tacos have shrunk in size since the first time I came when they first opened."}
{"text":"I followed my heart, it led me to Tacos Tijuana. Their Al Pastor is definitely a ticket to flavortown."}
{"text":"Tacos are terrible. Bad soft tasteless tortilla, and expensive $27 for two people  Seems to be popular but I rather make the drive to 12st and Thomas to Charlie's tacos are amazing there."}
{"text":"First off this is my First visit, must say the cooks are Rude! The Food was nasty meat and Tortilla. I ordered quesadilla and burrito de tripa the meat was hard and just plain nasty. Really won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here to satisfy my taco craving during lunch, and they definitely delivered! I had the Carne asada tacos & they were DELICIOUS! They gave healthy portions of meat, the tortillas were fresh, I couldn't ask for better. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The meat in the tacos were plentiful but just, ok tasting. Nothing great, but not bad. The corn tortillas on the other hand were pretty much tasteless. Like they were lacking something? Overall the place was 50/50. The prices were tolerable so it made the shortcomings tolerable."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here, and I loved it! I had a steak taco, and it was so juicy and flavorful. I'm not the biggest fan of corn tortillas, but these corn tortillas were amazing! They were moist, unlike many corn tortillas I've had that are dry. All in all, it was so delicious and will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican tacos.  Highly recommend this place and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I am a new and big fan of Taco Tijuana! I just happened to drive by and decide to go in and I was not disappointed. I tried to the adobada and carne asada. So good. And the green salsa crema type stuff on there was excellent. I highly recommend and plan to go back many many times."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Lines can be a little long but they are worth it. Perfect to grab a quick bite to eat. Not to pricey either. Recommend it to grab and go. I have never ate there though. It's in a parking lot but the set is good . There is canopy light and tables to eat if you want. Recommended more for grab and go!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop by this place on 5/3/16 and I'm glad we did.  The menu is very simple, two kinds of meats (carne asada and el pastor) and three ways to have it (tacos, quesadilla, mulitas).  There is small podium where you place your order from then you have a seat at the tables under the covered area and they bring the food out to you.  The trailer they serve out of looks pretty new and from what I could see inside it looks very clean, along with the glass windows in front you can partially see inside and can see the el pastor on the reel thing that gyro meat is usually on.  It is kind of loud here only because you are at a major intersection, but with nice weather in the evenings and tasty food you don't really notice.  The food was served with a lemon slice and there is mild and hot sauce on the tables to use.  I am not a huge fan of corn tortillas, but they taste so right with the tacos and mulitas.  Overall the food was very tasty and I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"After looking for some good cheap home (L.A.) food in Vegas I came across this place. I was told that this place had the real other side of the border tacos and sure enough....they weren't lying! Hand made tortillas! Awesome guacamole! Just amazing Tijuana style tacos. While I'm from LA Im used to dollar tacos so $2 per taco was on the pricier side...BUT...I cannot complain! Well worth the price...but hey if your in Vegas might as well spend your money (that you will end up giving to the casinos) on some good tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've found in Phoenix!  Homemade tortillas  The carne asada Is never dry. The people are always nice. I've never had an issue with the line i think I just get lucky.  But I hear it does get pretty packed. Trust me it's worth it if you wait."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for delicious tacos with homemade tortillas! I've been multiple times and have yet to have a bad meal. Little bit of a wait when they are busy, but it is worth it!! The staff is super friendly and tentative! If you're in the area you MUST stop by and get yourself some amazing tacos!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service. I enjoy the outdoor dining area. I could eat there everyday. Their tacos are to die for and so are their sauces!! I hope the expand their business. I only wish they had some more choices on their menu."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on yelp on this place a lot of people seemed to of liked this place. First off the lady making my food wasn't wearing GLOVES i should of left right then and there absolutely ridiculous anyways ... I ordered the pastor and I did not like it I didn't even finish it. Ie never had pastor all I new was that it marinated meat I was expecting something awesome and I'll I got was the regular meat you get on the fries you order at tacos el Gordo . The cilantro on the pastor wa ridiculous , cilantro is way to over powering and really it was the cilantro that killed the pastor and the whole disappointment of the whole dish . I will not be returning and will not recommend this place to anyone . Sorry  but tacos el Gordo still has my win"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price! Guacamole adds great flavor to a simple taco. Staff is always very friend. It has become our taco Tuesday spot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I had the carne asada tacos, they are served on corn tortillas. The tortillas were soft but didn't break apart and the meat was not overcooked or greasy. This food has a very authentic taste, it is definitely worth checking out. The atmosphere is very laid back."}
{"text":"The best street tacos you can Imagine! Absolutely delicious and a great price. I love the atmosphere is like being in Tijuana enjoying true Mexican tacos"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are amazing! My 2.5 yr old son ate 2 by himself :D highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Now these are some mighty fine tacos!   Authentic street tacos, perfectly seasoned, all the right trimmings.  The price is right.  The flavor is spot on.   Grab some whenever you are near, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simple food simple atmosphere and friendly staff. Just like the street tacos in Mexico, tasty stuff!"}
{"text":"Handmade tortillas!! Tremendous meat! Savory chile! Awesome flavor!! Don't miss this amazing taco spot. Grab a quesadilla or mullita, but this is a place you must try."}
{"text":"Really good I loved it and customer services is good they speak Spanish and English and everyone was really friendly"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the tacos were so delicious I did not have time to take pictures. Both the Al Pastor and the Carne are absolutely fabulous but I would say the Al  Pastor is my favorite of the two. The food is extremely fresh and delicious. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I would recommend going and I personally would go several times a week!!  There are two locations, 51st Ave. and Bell Road near the harbor freight and the 67th Ave. and Thunderbird north west corner food truck in the parking lot of a bicycle shop."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas. And I've tried quite a few.  While El Gordo is the big name joint, I think Taco Tijuana is better for two reasons. One is freshness: for some reason El Gordo's taste a little old, while Taco Tijuana is always juicy and tender and amazing. They have the same style and menu, so the nuance of preparation is key. The second is portion. Taco Tijuana tacos are MUCH larger, bursting with more meat, than their competition. I was disappointed by the skinny taco I got at El Gordo last time. You get double your money at this place, so it's become my go to, and I figured it was time I wrote them a much due review. The staff is friendly as well.  Al Pastor, Cabeza, Lengua, and Buche are my favorites, in that order."}
{"text":"I decided to come here after driving past it so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull menu, no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I ordered a tripa and an al pastor. I was the only one there, and it took them a good five minutes to prepare them. Not only that, they messed up my order, they gave me a cabeza instead of tripa. Very disappointed.   If I ever come back I'll know what to expect."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to hear they are open again , love this taco truck , It totally worth the money and the  time spent eating in the heat"}
{"text":"This tacos are the real deal, I used to go to tijuana just eat tacos and I then 15 years later I found this taco truck gave a try and love them! Same flavor and everything sooo good"}
{"text":"Just yesterday i decide that taco tijuana was no longer the place it used to be 2yrs ago.It has become as chaotic as Tacos El Gordo.The quality of the food has drop from a 5 rating to a 2 in my book. I used to like it so much that friday nights was Taco Tijuana night.Last night was the last straw i dint finish my burrito that was stuffed with dry rice and bits of carne asada. The tacos de lengua were rubbery and oozzing green tomatillo sauce .The tacos some how have shrank.The asada fries are shoe string fries coverd in sour cream and cheez with bits of carne asada. Me and my wife moved from Southen California in 2012 and had tried many places before discovering Taco Tijuana. Now they are like any fast  taco joint a copy of the equally bad Tacos El Gordo. To the dueño of Taco Tijuana.Lla deja de viajar tanto a ver Al America y a la sleccion y deja de desquidar el changarro."}
{"text":"This is what you call tacos. There is no such thing as \"street tacos\" or \"gourmet tacos\".  There's only tacos, and this place knows it, and that's what they serve. When I lived in Mexico this place would have been just another good taco stand. But here in town, they are a great taco place.  So, when you are craving Tacos, and I mean real tacos, this should be on your top 5 in town. Don't ask for a burrito, or a vegetarian taco, or any other substitutions that kill the taco. Just give the guy the number of tacos that you want followed by \"Asada\" or \"Al Pastor\" and enjoy."}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada tacos! Just went for lunch and it was delicious! Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Over the past few months I've driven by this place and noticed long lines with a packed out parking lot. To most, this is an immediate indicator that the place must have great food. Without a doubt, Tacos Tijuana offers the best street tacos in the area. Perfectly marinated carne asada and al pastor, the meat offered here is paired perfectly with fresh onion, cilantro and guacamole. What's the cherry on top? They serve Mexican cola in the bottle! Will definitely be back with my lady and the boys."}
{"text":"The tacos here are consistently amazing. I don't even bother going anywhere else for tacos, because I know they won't be as good.The tacos are a little small, but that just might be the fat kid in me wanting more. If you're like me, you look through yelp to find new spots to eat and go by the reviews, then trust me, this place is awesome. Get off yelp and get tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Great service! No need to go south of the border for tacos anymore! Green salsa is amazing. Pastor tacos are my fav!"}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious! They do take long and the setting is a hustle but in my opinion well worth the wait! Hands down one of the best taco place in Phoenix. I moved from California and we got some bomb tacos over there and this are BOMB better than Charlie's, and other taco trucks I've tried in the north Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Not only some of the best food I've had in Las Vegas, but also the healthiest.  There's no deep frying going on here my friends.  The best Mexican food I've ever eaten in my life, and I'm from south Texas!  Being a local, I eat here as much as I can.  The tortillas are homemade right in front of you, the meat is cooked here, the salsa is amazing, my favorite are the cabesa tacos, which is meat of the head of the cow, which if you know anything about beef, that's where the most tender and flavorful juicy meat is.  I always buy at least 6.  No preservatives, no BS, just outstanding quality service, and some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Hands down.  No casino in vegas or any restaurant in vegas beats these tacos.  If you want to jizz in your pants, get $10 (because that's all you'll need to get full) and head over there and enjoy."}
{"text":"The Tripa Tacos are the best! all of their food is good though"}
{"text":"The tacos here are great. I had the adobada and lengua, and they were very similar to the ones at Tacos El Gordo. The place was on the smallish side, but there weren't a lot of people in there. If you like El Gordo but need something less hectic, this place is two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in the valley. I really like the simple menu (two types of meats) and quesadillas. The service is always great. What sets them apart from the others? The homemade yellow corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I ordered food to be delivered from this place and it was unidible. I am Mexican and I know Mexican food. After a few bites it went in the trash. The carne asada burrito meat was overcooked and tasted burnt. The pastor burrito tasted horrible like old meat and had this weird pink tint to it. The pineapple in it tasted bitter. I wish I took a picture before it went in the trash. Truly disgusting. Never eating at this place!"}
{"text":"\"Simple food cooked with fresh ingredients and passion, is sometimes the best food you can find\" FOOD: My husband and I had 4 Al Pastor and after a free testing of Buche also had 4 of those. The meats tasted great, they were hot to the touch and juicy as if just recently cooked. The tortillas were also soft but not to the point were they would break with the heavy weight of the meats and toppings. The salsas, both the red and green were very tasty, not too hot not to mild. The mulas, which we had never had before are actually an upgrade from a regular quesadilla, which we loved! The addition of melted cheese along with the meats and fresh guacamole made them a wonderful experience.  SERVICE: Service was exceptional, not only did they explain every cut of meat but offered a free tasting so we knew what we were ordering. Yes, there are other Tijuana Style tacos out there, but the personal service and attention to detail made this one our best experiences yet. SITTING AREA: I agree with the other reviewer, sitting may be an issue during peak times, but we were there at approximately 6pm on Thursday and we had a table with no issues. PRICE: You can not beat a total bill of under $20 dollars for 8 tacos, 2 mulas and two free-refill drinks, to include Aguas Frescas if you choose, amongst the variety of sodas. You can definitely bring the family for a great time and they will be full!  My only concern is that as with other \"recently opened\" places they will change in time, cut on the servings, forget about the customer service and raise their prices....unfortunately we have seen it too many times with both restaurants and grocery stores. As for now, you have new faithful customers who will pass on the great experience to others!"}
{"text":"Two words: Al pastor. It's so good! They should just call it crack because once you taste it, you can't stop craving it. My mouth waters just thinking about it. They also serve carne asada which is very good as well. You can get the meat of your choice in a taco or quesadilla. Both versions are a win so you can't go wrong either way.   They make their tortillas on site (you can see them being made) so you'll always have that fresh, homemade taste. Their salsas are out of this world, too. If you want spicy, go for the red bottle.   The staff is very friendly and is always checking on you to make sure you're okay. Ordering is easy and the time to get your food is quick. Even though this place is outside, it's worth braving the Phoenix heat."}
{"text":"As few have posted already, their Al Pastor is ace. Went in out of the blue on the way to Arby's -___- but seeing as how the building used to house my favorite nacho spot in the city (super burrito) I decided to return to this weird shack of a building. I am so glad I did, their Tacos Al Pastor combined with the sauce they put in the taco is so ridiculously good, I'd compare it to Tacos El Gordo. I love you weird shack of deliciousness and I hope this business stays open."}
{"text":"Wow.. These tacos are one of the best Ive had. Asada, alpastor, you name it. I even tried the tripes and not a fan of this meat, but damm it was good. Highly recommend this spot.. By the way, the service was also fast."}
{"text":"This was amazing authentic street tacos! Had a taco n one each of there specials! Price reasonable Will certainly be back n highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, as authentic as it can get! Worth the drive from South Phoenix. Al pastor meat was right on and made on a trompo. Yummy"}
{"text":"Wow! These guys are now open for lunch! Booyah! Been hearing a lot of good things about this place and was cruising by and had to pull over. Glad I did. The Carne and Pastor is off the chain. I like that they use 1 tortilla instead of 2 and that the tortilla is soft like the ones you get at ranch market. They could use a green sauce in my opinion, but I ain't hating. Think I'm probably gonna go back tonight. Don't judge me!"}
{"text":"Homemade corn tortillas and yummiest steak and carnitas around! The best street tacos ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone that works here is so nice! Best tacos in Las Vegas my family and I will most definitely be going back again and again"}
{"text":"Soooo good!!! Just Go!   Don't let any apprehensions hold you back"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Great street tacos. Fabulous pork (my fav) and steak cooked on a vertical roaster and sliced thin.  Nicest folks working there as well. Tucked away in a parking lot with a food truck to prepare the food and a canopied eating area. Too cool"}
{"text":"This is the best place for Carne Asada Street Tacos!  Fresh, tasty food!  They are friendly and the prices are affordable!  My favorite Friday night dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for very fast, inexpensive, tasty authentic tacos! The hot sauce is crazy hot but good! I got the carne asana tacos and they were the best I've had in a while! Great little food truck."}
{"text":"This food was trash. My brother and I ordered sopes and they tried to sneakily hide that they burned both of them by flipping them over. The meat was also under-cooked and slimy..Avoid this place, it was completely disgusting. The only thing on my plate that was edible was the onion. -.- I cook Mexican food every day and was looking for a good restaurant with my family. None of us enjoyed the food and we left so unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to try this place out and I was immediately disappointed by the service of the cashiers, but the cooks were very nice. We ordered a tripas burrito with everything and a large order of carne asada fries... I was excited to go home and eat it and the second I unwrapped it I could tell something was wrong. The tortilla was extremely gritty and when I took a bite it was of just of the strangest cheesy and crunchy texture that tasted like a week old velveeta that was left out and just thrown into the burrito. I usually am very picky about the tripas meat too, and found myself almost puking from disgust from the stale and over-salted meat; there was no beans or rice... Nothing I've ever had in a burrito but this cheesy mess and over cooked meat.  My boyfriend opened his meal and found a weird minty green sauce over the fries. I took a bite out of his fries (which was definitely an improvement from my burrito) and it was alright, but still wasn't good. I'd recommend not going unless you're probably getting tacos... Which I'm not going back to have."}
{"text":"So glad I tried this place. My buddy told me how good their Taco Truck location was but I never got a chance to see for myself. Saw the sign for this place and realized it's a brick and mortar affiliated with the other location. It did not disappoint. Both the Carne Asada and Al pastor were delicious. The home made tortillas were to die for. The red chili had the perfect amount of heat and flavor.  I even liked the guacamole which I'm not a huge fan of.  All and all you need to give this place a try. The price is very reasonable. 3 tacos and a Mexican coke for around $7 fills you up. I will definitely be going back with my whole crew."}
{"text":"Best place to get authentic Mexican carne asada tacos. It's not like your average ramiros or filibertos. Tortillas are handmade and the quesadillas are also 10/10. Me growing up with 100% Mexican parents I could say that this place is the closest thing to real tacos. I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Tortillas a mano ,   Service was friendly and fast. AL pastor tacos are filled with flavor. I would hold off on the sauce though so u could actually taste the flavor of the meat. Lengua tacos are perfect ! I will be returning soon"}
{"text":"This is a great little find! Tried the carne asada and al pastor tacos with the hot sauce and they were delicious. I will be going back and will support local!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, if your in the area try either location. I've been here several times and never been let down."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  Best tacos. Quesadillas are filled with a lot of meat. We are making this outlet regular taco stop!!!"}
{"text":"Its an alright place but there prices are incredibly high...  like why would you pay that much its nothing premium and you can go across the street to taco bell and save more."}
{"text":"Best tacos on this side of town! Glad it's close to home, definitely my new spot for tacos!"}
{"text":"Best taco stand in town! The vampiros and mulitas are my favorite, and the homemade corn tortillas are delicious. Short and simple menu, great food."}
{"text":"Fire street tacos  whoever says otherwise on here is lying to you. Great carne.. great tortillas, you can tell they take their time with it."}
{"text":"Came mid afternoon on Tuesday. Tacos 20% off and delicious! Nice outdoor seating space, good music, good food! Heard it gets very busy at times but this was a great time to come."}
{"text":"The great taco quest continues....  This place is excellent. Friendly staff, fat tacos, great prices and a clean restaurant. Price is outstanding. I think around $1.85 (????) or so per taco. Can't remember for sure. They win on all fronts and do not fall short.   Sure, it would be nice if there was a better selection of sauces, but that's ok, we can't have it all.   Ordered al pastor and chicken tacos and I'm so glad I did. Got some veggies grilled up at the same time and the food couldn't have tasted better. Only downside is that they didn't put pineapple on the pastor. I guess you have to ask? I didn't know until I got home, so next time for sure I'll request it.   This place is small and can easily be missed. It's on the north side of Tropicana next to Arby's in a so-so shopping center.   Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down these guys have the best al pastor taco I've eaten in Las Vegas. We can quibble about texture, moisture, seasonings, and toppings, but I cannot believe that anyone is doing it better than Taco Tijuana.  They've been open for about a week and today was the first chance I go to stop in and see what Taco Tijuana (TT) is all about. When you walk in things are a bit confusing. There was only one other family when we arrived, but we had a time trying to figure out where to go to order.   That is not a negative.  Just an observation. What seemed a bit confusing to me, could easily be a specific method for keeping the taco ordering flow moving smoothly when they get busy.   A sweet employee can to our aide and chatted with us while we were deciding and ordering. Like many places they have a few different stations. The gentleman at the pastor station offered us a sample and I stayed there and ordered the rest of my meal.   Can we have a moment of silence for the al pastor? The tortillas are homemade and soft from oil and heat if the grill. The meat itself was succulent and delightfully seasoned (ancho chilies? cumin?) and had a bit of char still on the edges. If you haven't had an al pastor taco, it's a distant cousin to to Lebanese shwarma--both use the vertical spit.  The Mexican version consists of pork cooked with pineapple to bring out the sweetness in the meat. At TT they top the taco with a dab if salsa and some light green sauce. Was it a thin guacamole? I honestly don't know. It had a hint of cilantro and chile. But with the ingredients combined, that taco hit every note.  It's been a while since I had tacos in Tijuana. But TT has captured the soul that I remember in a small bite.   The suadero taco was well prepared. It's a tougher piece of meat, but you wouldn't know it from the taco at TT. Their meat was moist and very tender. It lacked a bit of flavor (which the meat generally has), but TT wisely adds a different topping to this taco. They added a thinner, spicier salsa atop the suadero. It was a lovely bite.  The asada taco was not extraordinary, but it was nice enough.The meat was nicely seasoned and it was topped with a simple, fresh salsa.   The staff was kind and added extra meat (without us asking) to a skimpy looking taco. In addition, they gave us roasted peppers and onions for free. I don't expect that to last long.   In short, this place was delicious. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This food truck is as good as it gets for tacos!  The handmade tortillas clinch it!  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Super delicious tacos, love the simplicity of it and their choices.  Authentic & great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Every single employee is so kind and patient. Would recommend to anybody!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos.  Not many meat options to choose from but the asada and pastor are all you need.  The asada mulitas are very good.  Also...the tortillas are made fresh.  I recommend this place.  But...do eat there because if you order for takeout it takes long."}
{"text":"After driving past Tacos Tijuana almost every day, my girlfriend and I decided to stop in and try the food and I must say, we were happy we did. The food was very good (Tacos de Adobada, Tacos de Asada and Tacos de Sesos). Service from ALL of the staff was excellent! Denise, Mike and Benjamin were awesome. Mike made us feel welcome with a warm greeting and inquired about our visit. Benjamin and Denise helped us decide what to eat with no hesitation as well as providing us with a welcome greeting upon our first step into the restaurant. We WILL be back! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Mexican food ,and Taco Tijuana had great reviews. I didn't care much for the taco asada; it had too much filling that overpowered the meat. The quesadilla wasn't bad although everything fell out of it easily. Usually what's inside in quesadillas stay inside. I did like the ingredients, which made it different from your typical quesadilla. The service was friendly and a bit wild (the female cashier), but I don't think it's enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"My favorite taco place. Al pastor tacos all the time.  The Asada tacos are good but the last few times I ordered them they were cold so I since always go with the pastor."}
{"text":"Pretty good taco's they are the LA style. I  though they were plain, always crazy busy so we had to try it."}
{"text":"Finally a taco truck on this side of town! The great part is, its not just any taco truck. I don't even like corn tortillas very much, but these are amazing! I highly suggest you give it a shot! I hope they are there to stay!"}
{"text":"Ok......here's the deal...stopped yesterday, based on what we saw on yelp..All I can say is what a find......great customer service....and for street tacos...this place is over the top....give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos i have had in glendale. I will definitely come back here and bring my family and friends and everyone in the whole world"}
{"text":"finally! found some real Mexican tacos!, these are authentic, tasty and amazing tortillas.  Been a native Californian/Mexican  we have just about all what we crave when it comes to food.  This a great location, there's no such a thing who is who? We come enjoy tacos, the most simple food yet delicate and satisfying, love it!  Can't wait to come back, almost forgot! after enjoying carne asada and al pastor tacos you can finish with churros as a desert made fresh on the spot. Little stand nest to it Authentic!  OMG so excited I found a little piece of Mexico!  Tacos Tijuana Rocks!"}
{"text":"This is such a good taco place. We just moved from California and got recommended here! So worth the wait!! I love the carne asada and the quesadillas where bomb! Def coming back"}
{"text":"This place has excellent Mexican food. I got the beef fajita plate and it was beyond on point. The atmosphere is pretty diving which is nice because I really didn't feel like having to get dressed up and go somewhere upscale. The price was alright for what we got. It was pretty comfortable to what you would pay for most Mexican restaurants. What I like the waitress was super friendly and the portions were pretty big. One regret I have there was not asking if they had corn tortillas I just automatically went with flour. Corn would have been off the chain whatever. I think this is a perfect second date spots or 5th date spot if you get my drift"}
{"text":"I stopped by on a weeknite, not very busy but it took a little too long to get my order...i would probably not stop by on a busy nite....carne asada tacos a really good though."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great atmosphere.  The owners are great people and their service is great.  The pastor is the best ever!"}
{"text":"Simply put, some of the best street tacos I've ever had in Arizona it is a must try for those who have never been"}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  Hand made tortillas, delicious tacos and reasonable prices! The closest I've gotten to real street tacos. Yumm!!"}
{"text":"This is the place for tacos! Let me begin by saying being i'm an L.A native, this place reminds me of the taco restaurants from back home. Their tacos \"al pastor\" are definitely worth trying. They do have a taco plate meal which consists of; a plate of meat (depending on choice) that is accompanied by onions, cilantro, and about 5-6 tortillas, therefore you can create/ serve yourself your own tacos as you eat. Their staff is very courteous and helpful. I would definitely be returning to this restaurant upon my future visits to Vegas!"}
{"text":"We finally found a taco shop!!! Hands down!! Drove all the way from buckeye and worth the drive!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with street tacos, especially on a hot afternoon. My friends each had two tacos al pastor ($2 each), and I had one al carbon ($2) and one lengua ($2.25). Loved the lengua, but the al carbon was pretty pedestrian, although it had a healthy topping of guac. I much preferred the al pastor, so that's the route I'll take next time.  Be sure to load up on the radishes (wish they had carrots as well), and ask the cook to add grilled onions and a jalapeño!"}
{"text":"When I crave Mexican food, the flavors of their perfectly cooked meat and the freshness of their homemade tortillas is EXACTLY what I'm looking for.  They don't get skimpy with their meat, they don't waste time with beans or rice, they'll let you sample any of the meats before you order them, and they gladly explain what everything is for the unfortunate people like myself who don't speak Spanish.  I eat here at least once a month, and I eat the same thing every time, pork sopes with everything on it.  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This is by fair the best place I have ever been to for tacos! I traveled from Tempe to come eat here. I definitely will be back. You doesn't love good food and Mexican music? Happy customer!"}
{"text":"Not awful, but this place doesn't compare well with all the other nearby Mexican places.  I was a little surprised that there were no chicken or fish options. So, I ordered the Taco Tijuana with pork.  The tortillas were small and greasy. The meat was fine, but not very much of it. The accompaniments were good.  I realize that Tijuana-style street tacos are mean to be just a couple of bites to eat on the run. Still, I would have liked more food for the price; ...and a few more meat and/or vegetable options.  The service was fine."}
{"text":"Had some tacos in other chain restaurants, but these are the best in Metro Phoenix. Tacos Tijuana had great service and serves all its tacos with guacamole, so no need to ever ask for it. Their tacos are served up just like they would be from any street taco joint in Baja. If you want real tacos, come here. You can even get a green bottle coke here."}
{"text":"This place puts out an excellent carne asada taco and the service here is beyond any other you'll find at any  other taco truck."}
{"text":"So glad to finally have a taco truck on this side of town! These tacos are so full flavor..they specialize in carne asada and al pastor! Their salsa is amazing and the corn tortillas are also hand made!! Definitely beats Waldos tacos in my opinion. If you want real, authentic tacos you need to try this food truck!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with their service. The steak tacos are great though. The business model would run much better if they didn't have you waiting in line as you first walk in, make you're selection and pay up front.  More enjoyable experience would be to have a sit down / waiter take your order, instead of the wait in line time, before you may join the place.   The staff was all over the place. Very disorganized. The cook/waiter walked up to our table to ask what it was that we ordered (paid) after 15 minute waiting in line.  So after taking the order they did not know what we had paid and ordered in the first place?  Decided it was not worth the 'praise' as stated here at Yelp. Great food but lousy experience."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos I've had in AZ the only problem the tacos were a little cold maybe because it's winter but the other than that delicious tacos"}
{"text":"All good till they ran out on Limón at 9 pm on a Saturday? ?? Like wtf ??? I'm a mutha fucking foooodiean !!!!!"}
{"text":"My boss ordered taco for our entire office from this place. They were absolutely delicious. I could not get enough. The salsas were very tasty as well."}
{"text":"New ownership, great food and service. Try the carne asada vampiro and anything pork and you can't go wrong. I've got my new taco stop!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Had the Pork Vampiro and it was yummy. Service was great and she was friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic tacos just like tijuana!  Can't beat these tacos anywhere in Phoenix!  Come by and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service.   I recommend the al pastor tacos. The service size is very generous and with the freshly hand made tortillas add to the flavor."}
{"text":"This place is off the hook. Excellent tacos made with soft corn tortillas cooked on site. Come early because parking is limited."}
{"text":"This is one of the best roadside meals you can have in the area. These guys serve up a gourmet quality Mexican fare from a trailer in a parking lot. It is recognized by the The locals as exemplified by the Vold parking lot at all meal times when they're open. This was probably the best business move that the bike shop could have made by including them in their area to improve traffic for their business. :-)"}
{"text":"I think I like it.  All I need is a cold dos equis and I'm back in TJ heading back from a late night on Revolution Blvd.  Al pastor is my favorite, but the carne adada is pretty good to.  The hot salsa had a kick, but it's worth clearing the sinuses over.  I'm becoming a fan of the vampiro and you can't complain about fresh corn tortillas.  All with a nice cold bottle of coke.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Last night was the grand opening of theier new brick and mortar location.  Same great food as their truck.  My plate was loaded with al pastor tacos and they did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food el adobada is sooo good plus very inexpensive and delicious!  Can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"I work so close to this Taco shop it's so hard not to eat it everyday!! The carne(steak) quesadilla is soo delish!! The carne is seasoned perfectly and is nice and tender! The cheese is delish and is made fresh to order!! The wait is not long at all! The service is quick and friendly and food is truly authentic, tasty food that will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed, we always love coming here to eat and the tacos are amazing. But let me tell you why I am rating this a 1 Star. First I was told the tacos would be about 40 minutes to come out (waited an hour & a hlf) and I was okay with that. But it's very unfortunate that today 4/24/18 the lady who was working cashier was very condescending and rude. My mother & I asked for chairs to sit at a table and were told there wasn't anymore. So we decided to take our order to go, because there werent chairs avail since that's what we were told 30 minutes pass and they open up a huge truck filled with chairs; the available tables & chairs were then given to other customers behind us. It was a terrible experience. Sadly this will be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"AMAZING tacos.  Legit. If I could mich drop this place I would. Anytime I am in the area I come here."}
{"text":"The guys serving your food are rude... I think they thought I didn't understand Spanish lol ILL NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I'm from San Diego and Tijuana is literally 20 minutes away but this place did not meet any of my standards for tacos. The tortillas were the best part. The carne asada tacos were flavorless and they skimp on the guacamole. The al pastor tacos were the same and they didn't even add a lime for our to go order. The quesadillas were super small, totally not worth $6. Overall I would not go back."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff! I will definitely come back when I come to the Vegas strip"}
{"text":"Friendly service, but smaller selection & less flavor than Tacos y Taco down the street."}
{"text":"The people here are so awesome. We ordered and we were served right away.  There was enough meat in the carne asada tacos to make an extra taco! Plus it had guacamole that other places charge extra for. They are open late on the weekends too. Great for that after party stop. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Especially of their asada- one tortilla, guac, and char; simple and delicious. Their $2/taco rate is fair for the amount of meat they stuff in these babies. I do wish they'd add an actual salsa bar, but being able to get fresh-grilled peppers and onions is always a nice perk.  Like I said, the asada is my preference here at Taco TJ. The suadero is nice and spicy, the al pastor lacked the crispy bits and pineapple I was craving, and the lengua could have been a bit softer. Note that lengua here goes for $2.25. Have yet to try the tripas.  Props to the staff for being quick and helpful- they had no problem packing and labeling our massive order. Though I don't live nearby, I like that they are open til 1AM. Follow them on social media for alerts about their sales and discounts."}
{"text":"Awesome steak tacos!Love having lunch here I always crave their tacos they are really good!"}
{"text":"Overall the food deserves 5 Stars and more!  Tacos are delicious!   Only down fall during my visit last night was it was obviously busy so I asked the cashier what the wait time is he said just about 20 mins which is understandable considering it was also National Taco Day, and amount of clientele. Mostly to go orders tables came available fairly quickly.  However those 20 mins came and went, before I knew it a whole hour had passed by, the crown downsized significantly again mostly to go orders. By the time they called my number and plates were brought to my table was at the hour twenty mark.  Food was delicious but I don't think I'll be waiting an hour for food here again.    This was my second visit, first visit was a Thursday night arrived around 9:30 and unfortunately they were all out of meat, which is why this time around I arrived earlier."}
{"text":"Seriously you are missing out if you haven't tried it yet. They are closed Sunday Monday which I'm sad but they work so hard I don't mind them having a weekend. The meat is so tender. It's worth every penny. And no matter how hot it is they don't mind the heat and still have a smile on."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Tacos Tijuana. The tacos are very good, I like the fact that their menu is small and simple. The Al Pastor meat has a small sweet kick, maybe a small dose of cinnamon. This is different but makes their Al Pastor tacos unique and delicious. The carne asada meat was well seasoned. I highly recommend the vampiro which is a homemade tostada with meat and veggies. Ambience: it's a taco truck with Class is how I would describe it. The only thing I would recommend is there is room for growth in the salsa department. The red one was okay and spicy, wish the green one had more flavor. In all, keep up the good work! I will definitely be back and recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"First time visiting yesterday evening. We tried a vampiro, mulita and tacos. There's nothing better than fresh, homemade tortillas (the yellow corn was a unique twist), savory and quality al pastor and fresh toppings. Definitely deserving of their \"Best of Phoenix\" spot for 2017. We'll be returning"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas. My favorite one is the al pastor tacos and the asada fries. Ask the cook for grilled onions and grilled chiles and your set."}
{"text":"Great street tacos!!!  Make sure and try the al pastor tacos. Many people recommended them to me and they were right.  They have a very simple menu, but it is great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Truly great tacos!! The prices are very reasonable as well. Clean facility and very accommodating for large parties. Lots of space for seating"}
{"text":"This taco joint was amazing.  Real deal tacos and other dishes.  It was a bit confusing because when you order, you go up to which ever station has the dish you want.  So you can only order certain dishes from each cook.  There carne asada fries were amazing."}
{"text":"We've wanted to stop here for tacos for the longest time so very glad we did today! Prices are great. My husband got his plain but I wanted all the good stuff onions cilantro and guacamole. We will be back for our taco fix! The table next to us had a quesadilla and that looked amazing! Sitting area outside was clean and facing away from the sun."}
{"text":"Awesome environment, amazing food, fantastic prices, friendly service! We have been two nights in a row! Cindy was super friendly, the service was quick and the tacos delicious!  Can't $1.50/taco!!!"}
{"text":"Really good adobada tacos really close to tacos el gordo ones .. Fresh meat fresh sauce and tortillas ! Really good place I will come back soon !   They had other options in the menu for those who like lengua buche and all those things ! Go try it !"}
{"text":"OMG!  This place rocks!  Not only is the food absolutely PERFECT, but the service couldn't be more amazing!  Everything about these folks are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Another authentic taco place, that does it right. great flavor on the al pastor, love the fact that they also put pineapple on it. had the buche and suadero, wasn't as great as the one at gordo and taco y taco, but i thought the al pastor was right up there, would go back just for that."}
{"text":"Opened 15 days ago...food and service are amazing....tripa(tripe) tacos are the best.  And you can see for yourself as they will offer you a sample of any meat selection offered.  I will say that if you enjoy crispy tripa you will have to ask.    First time here this type of taco was amazing but the second time around the tripa was not crispy so we thought maybe we need to remind them that we would like it crispy, so we ordered a couple more EXTRA crispy we told the gentleman and he confirmed our order.  Unfortunately they were still not crispy but instead kind of chewy.   Since I know the first time was perfect I will continue to come back again besides the services is like no other!"}
{"text":"First off all they ran out off tortillas and took them 20 minutes to realize they were out and made us wait and they were arguing in front off customers poor managment i will never never recommend anybody this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The first visit, I was definitely impressed. Ordered the carne asada taco with cheese. The flavor was delicious! The meat was grilled thoroughly, cooking off most of the fat though a little remained. The flavor was so good I returned the next day with my wife. Was less impressed. The meat though flavorly, wasn't as tasty as the previous day. In addition, it was very fatty the second visit. The quality of the meat/grilling needs to be more consistent.  I'll give it one more try."}
{"text":"Omg so good I think I'm addicted. Al pastor tacos are amazing. Got to try if your in the area"}
{"text":"We have been trying to find a decent Mexican food place since we moved here about a month ago. I thought that this would be the one due to the consistent good reviews, however I thought wrong.  We kept it simple and ordered the Carne Asada Fries and a Carne Asada Quesadilla. The Carne Asada Fries were about 80% cheese and sour cream, which even when scraped off had almost no flavor. The Quesadilla was very odd to me. For some reason, the bottom of it was a flour tortilla, and on top of the somehow bitter meat was a tiny corn tortilla. I would hardly call that a quesadilla by any standards. We definitely will not be returning to this place since it is a waste of money."}
{"text":"I've been to this place more than 10 times and today was the first time I can say I'm very pissed off with what I got.  I ordered a large nacho with adobada & no beans.  When we got our food, my nacho had what I think is carne asada which was burnt so bad it was like burnt beef jerky.  I went to the cashier to tell her that to make sure I ordered the adobada which she said \"shit.\" & told the cooks that my nachos was supposed to be adobada; not carne asada.  I waited over 20 minutes & no nachos.  I went back to the cashier to let her know that I haven't gotten my nachos.  5 minutes later, I got the same burnt carne asada nachos with adobada on top of it.  Due to time constraints, I ate some of the good adobada on top & trashed the rest.  I went up on the cashier to let her know that the next time someone tells you that they ordered adobada instead of carne asada to tell the cooks DO NOT put the adobada over the carne asada.  She says sorry.  I wish I took a picture of it as the bottom wasn't even edible and got my money back"}
{"text":"Good tacos al pastor, a little pricey than a few months. A little more greasy,  mulitas are delicious!"}
{"text":"BEST, REAL street tacos north of the border. Seriously. Delicious corn tortillas made on site! Authentic,  cheap and delicious. My favorite taco joint in the world!"}
{"text":"The meat is amazing. I always get the carne asada tacos or quesadillas! Low prices and amazing flavorful food. Service is fast and good too. The meat is actually pretty fresh and good. They might not have an actual building on thunderbird but I prefer them ANYDAY out of most restaurants out here. Quick, easy, good food. Low prices. Beat street tacos I've ever had - hands down."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out because the reviews were amazing!  I've tried it once and the carne asado tacos were just okay.  A little bland, but nothing overly exciting.  I will try it again, it could have been an off day.  I think I was comparing this place to America's Taco Shop, which is, by far, my favorite taco place on the planet!  Will definitely give it another try!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the BEST PLACES TO GET YOUR STREET TACOS FOOD ON!! Tacos,Muletas, Vampiros, Quesadillas And Salsas/Hot sauces are soooo Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb tacos!!!! Soooo delish!! Fresh ingredients and made to order. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful, patient and outgoing every time I go. The carne asada is sliced thin and the helpings are huge. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first experience with Tacos Tijuana and I can't rave enough. By far the best carne Asada tacos I've had, from the freaking presses corn tortilla to quality meat cooked to perfection. Customer service was excellent as well. I will be back for sure and will absolutely tell my family and friends."}
{"text":"This is the best your going to get in Vegas. Been here a few times now and the food was excellent as was the service. This place is just like the name Tacos Tijuana. If you want authentic Mexican street tacos look no further."}
{"text":"Excellent food and not too expensive. I have as tried    the tacos, the burritos, and asada fries. Their asada fries are the best in town. Food is always fresh and good service."}
{"text":"Very good. Everytime I try a soft taco I think man I rather have the crunchy taco but when you try a taco here it's pretty amazing. The sopas are pretty special too because they cheese the tortilla while cooking it. If you want good Mexican food look no further."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite to eat. If you like $2 street tacos. Yum! Small menu so it's easy to pick out what you want to eat. I recommend the carne asada. We like to pick up our drinks across the street at Desert Eagle 1st and go crazy on tacos!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are to die for! Service is quick, food is great and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Just about the best street tacos you can get in the U.S.  Simple, superbly executed menu and cheap too.  Who doesn't like eating in a former circle K/bicycle shop parking lot?  Haven't been to the new eat in yet but I hear it's just as good but with real horchata!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times! Worth the wait! The tacos are delicious and the staff is very friendly! Great prices for what you get! Love supporting local!"}
{"text":"Tacos el gordo who? This place puts any other Mexican taco restaurant to shame. I honestly don't want a lot of people finding out about this place because I wanna keep it a secret so it doesn't get too crowded but at the same time this place deserves to be known a bit more. If you read this review come check out tacks Tijuana and don't tell too many people about it tho. I always like that I can find seats in this place and that it's not that expensive. (Please tacos Tijuana don't ever raise your prices). Haha anyway I definitely recommend and don't get too addicted like I got."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas this is always where we go for legit Mexican food. This place is pretty great when you get the tacos. Small, for sure, but delicious. The lengua tacos are particularly tasty."}
{"text":"Real authentic tacos!! It's hard to find good Mexican food in Arizona but this little food truck has got the goods!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place back when it was just a food truck and I loved it, we go on dates here all the time, to both the food truck and their new restaurant location! Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best \"authentic\" tacos west of i-17! Menu is small, straight the point and great prices!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Tacos Tijuana. Truly obsessed. How fortunate for me that my husband and I moved into this neighborhood.   I have yet to be inside the restaurant because we do takeout and my husband usually has the car, thus he's my delivery driver.   My go-to are the al pastor tacos and a carne asada quesadilla. And I haven't deviated yet.   The tacos are small so if you're also doing takeout or delivery just know you'll definitely want more than one. Unless you usually live on diet soda and air. Two tacos and half of a quesadilla will normally fill me up.   The only drawback for me is their salsa. Hot and super hot are what we've been given and I can't eat stuff that spicy. However I don't think the salsa is even necessary because once you squeeze lime juice on them, you're good to go.   Oh and I'm not a guacamole fan but what they put on is FABULOUS. Seriously. It's like avocado magic."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Vegas highly recommended you can't leave Vegas without eating here at tacos Tijuana"}
{"text":"Im never disappointed with this place, delicious food, friendly staff, affordable prices... always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Legit taco stand on the northwest side.  Finally.  All these taco shops keep popping up all over town that want to try to fancy the tacos up and slap a 3-4 dollar price tag on them.  Get out of here with that noise.  All the people really want is a cheap deliciously simple authentic street taco for a buck.  This place is doing just that.  There are only 4 things on the menu.  Tacos, quesadillas, mulitas, and vampiros.  You can get them with carne asada or pastor.  That is it.  There aint no reason for anything else!  Why you gotta have a menu with 5 pages when you can really only do 4 things well?    Tacos Tijuana knows whats up.  These tacos come with quality freshly made and pressed corn tortillas, fresh cooked meat, onions, and cilantro.  They are street sized, bout 4 bites.  And they have a couple salsas on the tables to choose from.  Both are tasty and compliment the tacos well.  The pastor is very flavorful, sweet with the pineapple and tangy from the marinade.  The carne asada was tasty as well.  The vampiro was amazing.  Crunchy crispy fried tortilla with carne asada, onions, peppers, and cilantro.  I could have ate 5 of them if they were a little cheaper. I would not recommend the quesadilla.  For 5 bucks I was expecting a much larger portion and better cheese.    A few things I would change if I owned this shop: Get some heat lamps for these winter months, move the trash cans further away from the tables, maybe do a couple of combos or discounts.  $1.50 for a street taco with homemade tortillas is legit but 5 bucks for a small plain cheese quesadilla is not.  3 bucks for a tiny vampiro is pushing it but it was so good I'd get one again).  The bottom line is if you live on this side of town and haven't been here you are missing out.  If you make bomb tacos and like money you are also missing out...on a golden opportunity.  They are lining up for these tacos folks!  If you make it, we will come!"}
{"text":"Recently had these tacos for lunch. Let me tell you they are so good! The restaurant has a very chill vibe. It has an easy menu. The tacos we're so good!  They are not greasy at all and the corn tortillas are the best!! (Yellow corn tortillas) This will definitely not be the last time I go here! And the prices are not bad at all! Definitely bringing the family here again soon."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town, specially the tortilla and salsa. Their meat selection is small but worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!! Best carne asada tacos hands down I definitely recommend anyone in the area try item you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"My mom and I found this place while on our way to the mall. This food truck is located on the corner of 67th Ave. and Thunderbird in a parking lot. We ended up ordering three Carne Asada tacos which come with guacamole, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and a choice of hot or mild salsa. The food was amazingly delicious! The staff is super friendly - Priscilla Barrios was very helpful! They have another location, however it is a restaurant. I'll be back for sure the next time I'm on the West side of town."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for a while and was craving street tacos yesterday. I only got to carneasada tacos, carneasada fries & wet burrito. The tacos are the star. Next time I'll only get tacos. Easily compared to tacos El gordo, but you don't have to deal with the strip or crazy lines. Plenty of indoor seating & fast friendly staff. Lots of parking too."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've had in Vegas...and a 4 star average rating? I stopped by here the other night after a 12 hour shift at the CES show working on their antiquated networks so I was hungry. I ordered 4 street tacos and a burrito. The food was completely inedible. The street tacos: asada and carnitas. Dry old tasting tortillas and probably a half a teaspoon of very mediocre meat. But it doesn't stop there. The worst part is they put this lime green mystery whatever that's like a combination of mayonnaise and I don't know. It was HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING! Almost made me puke! Couldn't even eat them. The al pastor burrito was nothing to write home about either. I can't really comment because they only put specs of meet. They're also disgustingly FILTHY. The lady I asked for salsa was cutting meat and handed me salsa with her meat gloves that touched my hands. My hands were not clean as I had just used the restroom at the convention center and there was no soap to wash my hands after handling my humongous sized package. GROSS! Feel sorry for the people who got some extra \"flavor \" on their sh*tty tacos."}
{"text":"Here is why they deserve five stars 1- you can pay with a card at the taco truck 2- once you sit down and place your order, they call out your number but bring it to you  3- if you are still hungry you can order more at your table and they will bring to you and charge you there. 4- the tacos are freaking amazing  5- the staff is friendly  6- the salsas are good 7- the pastor is authentic  8- the tortillas are handmade and you can taste it 9- the have cold drinks  10- it's close to where I live and since it is so good it deserves the five stars because there are not that many good tacos places near my home."}
{"text":"They're the best tacos I can find that reminds me of back home. These tacos do taste like the original Tacos Tijuana that I have had in Tijuana Mexico Baja California"}
{"text":"This is so good I can eat this all day even when I'm sleeping! I will sleep eat! I don't care if there is no such thing as that but I will make it a thing!"}
{"text":"Simple menu with great flavor. Pastor tacos are my favorite and the red sauce has a nice kick to it. The horchata is also very good."}
{"text":"I can explain why a place like this has so many high reviews. Because it is a novelty. In other parts of the world and even in California this sort of \"temporary restaurant\" is very common, but here in Phoenix, especially in such a suburban area it's a novelty.  I have eaten street tacos all over the country, in places like Miami, New York and LA. These are no where near that quality. The pictures posted here are deceiving, because these tacos are TINY. I imagine some one with an appetite could easily finish each taco in a single bite. In my opinion a full grown, hungry man could easily eat 10 of these tacos. The meat they use is nothing special at all and the only good part is the guacamole they use on them.  A few things to consider though, the red sauce they have is beyond hot and I have a high spicy tolerance. It not only was spicy in the mouth but just a teaspoon of it made me sick all night. Either it was that, or the tacos. The service was friendly no doubt but there is no value and if the food makes you sick why bother? There are a million great places in the Phoenix Valley to get tacos, why waste your time?"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time. I was finally in the area and had a chance to do so. With all the great reviews it really had me convinced that this place may be the best spot to grab some tacos. I've been craving some authentic tacos Al Pastor straight from el trompo. According to the pictures and an employee, they said the meat is cut as it directly hits the tortilla. Unfortunately, I was unable to try one of the tacos. They were out of Al Pastor. That was a bit of a disappointment since their only two meat options are Al Pastor and carne asada. They guy who took our order was friendly but he said they had ran out by 2pm and the owner didn't go stock up on his Al Pastor but would have some on Wednesday since that's their least busiest days. Okay, understandable. But if anyone is running a business and there's a hot item that you provide, then maybe it's best to prepare ahead of time to have it readily available and avoid disappointing or draw away the crowd. He convinced me to try the carne asada but that's not what I really wanted. Anyway, I tried the asada and they were good but it was more like as if it was cooked in some kind of juice rather than actually being grilled like asada should be. And I'm not sure if it was me or not but it kind of had a funny little aftertaste. It wasn't a bad one, just one I couldn't put my finger on. Service was great, they kept the place clean but was really disappointed the owner didn't prepare for running out of his popular item. May try the place again and hopefully they'll have Al Pastor."}
{"text":"I love the food at the taco stand near 67th Ave & Thunderbird. You can't go wrong with any menu items but I like the steak tacos the best. It's a great experience if you've never been to a taco stand or are from out of town."}
{"text":"Tacos. Plain and simple. I just come here and order beef tacos on Tuesday. Get some horchata, get some hot sauce, realize it's too spicy, switch to the other hot sauce, try the spicy one again, repeat. Maybe you want to try pork today, but no, your girlfriend is here, and she doesn't like pork. I know what you're thinking, that doesn't mean you don't have to get the pork tacos, but you're wrong. As soon as you eat those pork tacos she realizes all the things that she doesn't like that you do like, next she doesn't like you, and just like that you are sleeping in the car you invested your savings into because the apartment is under her name as well as the twin puppies she got you for your birthday. There's other things on the menu, but that's not why you are here, you are here for the tacos. Go ahead and order something else that you probably can't pronounce you millennial hipster, but for the rest of us, we eat tacos."}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the first time yesterday and loved it the food was really good the surface was nice parking was easy and the price was very affordable we will definitely be back and would recommend it to anyone who likes authentic tacos"}
{"text":"Good fast food with great flavor. The restaurant is very clean and inviting. The hot sauce is overwhelmingly hot so be careful. The only thing I would have liked to have more of is the cheese. They seem to use very little on the tacos and you have to pay extra if you want any at all."}
{"text":"This is the best taco spot in the valley, I have been coming in since they were just a taco truck up the street. I'm very happy for them finally getting a restaurant. The flavors are impeccable and the customer service is always great."}
{"text":"5 stars for Taco TJ! Everyone knows taco el Gordo on north side of the strip with long lines and higher prices.   But for the locals with vehicles the al pastor here is just as good if not better. They also have a special tomatillo green sauce here for your spice palate.   Located on the east side on Tropicana with a 'A' health grade and 2 for 1 Taco Tuesday! get some!"}
{"text":"fundamental solid carne asada.  no disappointments, no mystery meat.  never shorted or cheated on guacamole like other taco joints.  vampiro is a winner.  no frills, no bullshit. yummy yummy.  wished the patio seating had misters."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday discount! My girls and I had the late night munchies. Taco Tuesday here we come!  Awesome al pastor with a hint of cinnamon, shaved from a spot. Carne asada tacos are flavorful also. These tasty tacos are dressed with poco de gallo and guacamole. Cheese is extra. Check out their delicious homemade corn tortillas.  Their Special is a free Taco with a Yelp Check-in or a a Facebook Like!  Delicious food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. $2 a taco. The other Yelp reviewa made this place sound 10x better than it was. Being from the LA area this is no Taco Llama or Titos."}
{"text":"Excellent pork tacos, would love to have flour tortillas instead of the corn ones but great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada and al pastor tacos. It was just about the best carne asada I've had. The al pastor was very good as well, but the carne really stood out. The tacos were a bit smaller than I was expecting. Since there are no sides available, I'd recommend about 5 tacos per person.  Also, the horchata is very good. Strong taste of cinnamon, which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"I love this place. Tacos come out fast and delicious. Once the weather cools down, it'll probably be full every night! After I ate here for the first time, I had to let friends and family know about it immediately!"}
{"text":"Had there moolas yesterday.  Excellent, will drive here to get them again, the al pastor was dripping with flavor."}
{"text":"Tacos Tijuana is my favorite taco truck. Tacos are amazing and taste homemade!! The carne asada tacos and quesdillas are amazing. I highly recommend this taco truck, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The best tortillas I have ever tasted totally recommend this place. It is cheap and very Mexican authentic. Close if you are on Thunderbird and very good. Good service you don't have to wait long and there is plenty of seating for you to enjoy your food. Has shade and a great view of the sky."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I'm not sure why I've never heard of it before, but now that I know about it,  i can't wait to come back.  Great tacos!! Quick service and can't beat the price."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here for the first time about two years ago and let me tell you how amazing it is. They are so fast, the meat is seasoned to perfection and price is super cheap. Any time im in town I stop here!"}
{"text":"I think I just found my place away from home! Delicious tacos, vampiros, mulitas, quesadillas! Best part for all y'all, a small menu with two meats: Carne Asada and Al Pastor. Let's just say for a $1.75 Tacos they are under priced. They are delicious from the tortilla to the meats to the spicy salsas. I found my go to place for tacos! Their name says it all as a native San Diegan I have been in search of a place like home and well Phoenix here it is, Tacos Tijuana. Can't wait to come back for more"}
{"text":"No frills. Mexican street tacos. Super delish. Went back two days in a row. Carne asada is the way to go. My daughter had the horchata and loved it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went twice in 3 days lol... Can't wait to visit again... Hehe. Soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tacos are excellent. Their tortillas are excellent vampiros are excellent. Hot sauce is excellent. Everything is superb.   Highly recommend it ......"}
{"text":"I am going to say that taco Tijuana is better than taco El Gordo the reasons the tacos are much you don't have to wait in a big stupid line this place you get into eat your taco you enjoy it and then you're out been going there since they opened never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Everything I've said about Taco's El Gordo applies here except it's $.50 cheaper!   La madre santa de Dios que es un taco bueno! Have you ever had a taco so good that you spontaniously start speaking spanish? Yeah. Who knew a $2 taco could turn you into a cunning linguist? I don't know what it is about Tijuana street food but boy are we glad they set up shop here in Las Vegas! Taco Tijuana... Go! Go there now! Holy mother of God that's a good taco!  As we are both Mexican food aficionados, we were more than thrilled to finally find some good grub here in Vegas. For a mere two dollars you can get carne asada tacos, tacos de cabeza, tacos de lengua, and our personal favorite, tacos adobada (spicy pork). When you walk through the door you will immediately be greeted by the beautiful adobada roasting on a spit. Now really. Who doesn't like beautiful pork spinning about on a spit?"}
{"text":"Tacos Tijuana is mediocre. The place is well lit which I liked because I came late at night. There were people walking to and from their car which felt a little sketchy.  The menu is posted up top and includes what a majority consider Mexican food. However, it does NOT do Mexican food justice. The meat is low quality with chewy bits mixed in the tacos. The salsas are lacking in flavor and spice. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Yes! They're ABIERTO! Tacos Tijuana know what's up with their tacos and their hot sauce.  Don't let the little extra AZ heat scare you.  Friendly staff, ice cold drinks and great tacos"}
{"text":"This taco place is pretty well known in the area. Don't let the food truck fool you. They have quality food here. I've tried everything on the menu and they all were all good! There are only a few items on the menu which makes it easy and simple to order. The smaller menu makes it so they can provide better service to their customers.  The truck is located on the northwest corner on 67th and thunderbird (remember its a food truck, not a building :P). The parking lot can accommodate everyone that comes even when it gets busy. There is always a lot of people here but you don't have to wait long for your food.  There is a good atmosphere here. They have an outside siting area with napkins and two different kinds of salsa. I really liked the hot one!   Everyone here is really nice and always smiling. I would recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"These tacos are really good.  Nothing wrong with the food.  My issue was the service.  I showed with a party of about 8 people.  Busy Tuesday and I understand.  I was the last to order.  15 min went by and everyone started getting their order one by one. Finally the person before gets her order and I'm thinking mine is next.  My other buddy decides to order to go and 5min later gets his second order.  Then the table next to us starts getting their orders.  I asked one of the servers about my order and she said, \"maybe they forgot about you \".  I know she was being funny but at that time my party was pretty much done with their food.  I went to the counter and just asked for a refund.  Then they realized that they forgot my order and told me it would be out right away.  I declined and just asked for my money back for the second time.  Then one of the girls said \"take it to go!\", then I heard \"it's Tuesday, we are busy\".  Then the guy at the front said \"they lost the ticket, it happens a lot\".  All these suggestions and comments and not once did I hear \"hey man, sorry about that.\" Or \"that's our bad, we apologize\".  Simple apology and acknowledgement would it been cool, I would took my tacos to go."}
{"text":"Before I knew it as Taco Tijuana,  I just remember seeing a truck in the Golden Spokes parking lot that was always busy.  It's located on the busy intersection of 67th and Thunderbird.  One day, I told my husband, \"Hey, there's this taco truck by our house..we should go!\" And that is how we came about this taco truck.  The menu offering is quite limited, as there are only two choices for tacos:  carne asada and al pastor.  It also serves quesadillas, mulitas, and has plenty of Mexican coke, Fanta, water..you name it.   I have had both the carne asada and al pastor, and I have to say that al pastor wins my heart, but not by much.  Each taco comes with cabbage, onion, guacamole, and is on the most perfect handmade corn tortilla.  They compliment each other well.  Not to mention plentiful hot sauce; they have green and red.  I prefer the red as it has a kick.   I appreciate the fact that there's a tent, which adds a homey type feel.  There is plenty of seating and tables, as many patrons come and go.  Service here is top notch and workers are very friendly.  I definitely would recommend this gem to anyone looking for their taco fix.   Prices are very decent and the flavors are just perfect.  This establishment also takes cards, which is a plus!  Plenty of parking too."}
{"text":"Was I transported to my childhood taking day trips to Tijuana? Did I have flashbacks of sitting outside during a hot day and enjoying tacos with my dad? Yes Yes Yes. Someone had mentioned to me that we should go to Tacos Tijuana, and I was hesitant, because in California, Tacos Tijuana is an overpriced chain that isn't nearly as nostalgic. I am happy to say that I was clearly wrong. I cannot begin to express the atmosphere, simple menu and ability to sit, enjoy great music and wonderful company."}
{"text":"It was so good, clean and friendly service is a plus. I'm so glad this spot is close by me!!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos. Ordered the Orden del pastor for 8.99 and was able to make 8 tacos between me and the wife. It came out cheaper than ordering 8 al pastor tacos for $2 a pop. Asada fries are pretty good too. I recommend this place to any taco lover. 5 stars because of the Orden del pastor. Tacos El Gordo is still better but dont get me wrong, i still havent tried the tacos cabeza or tacos tripa here yet."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had on the west side. We saw this place on yelp and had to try it since we've been to every taco place. The meat was fresh and so good. The salsa was also very good. This is a must try place if you want good street tacos. Staff was also very friendly and family oriented.  I will definitely come back and would refer this place in a heart beat. They make the tortillas fresh on the spot . What more can you ask for besides selling beer hahahaha"}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I walked in, everyone was so nice and made me feel welcome! That's a big plus!   Not to mention the tacos are to die for. I've been to Tacos el Gordo and Taco y Taco, but I like Taco Tijuana so much better! I had the adobada or al pastor tacos with everything. The avocado creama and pineapple slice on them makes the marinade on the al pastor really come to life! I ordered a burrito to go and can't wait to crack into it for lunch!!  If you're looking for great authentic tacos. Taco Tijuana is the place! I'll be a returning customer from now on!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what the hype is about this place. My husband and I stopped here for a bite to eat. The line was long to order and it took forever to get our food. The food was not good and everything had the same flavor. I'm from San Diego and the tacos I've always enjoyed in Tijuana taste nothing like this. Pricey for what it is.  The garbage cans were so close to the seating area and stank so bad they were attracting tons of flies that would not stay away from our food.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place was totally amazing! I couldn't understand anything on the menu, but the owner was behing the counter and ready to help. We found this place on yelp while in town on vacation. We didn't want Margaritaville to be our Mexican dining exoerience while in town, and I'm so glad we found this place! Only about 10 minutes off the strip and totally worth the drive. The owner is from Tijuana and this is how they do it there! Try the pork in anyway that they serve it. Its amazing! Mexican soda's are really awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I hope nothing changes at this place, high quality meat, loveee the corn tortilla just wish the menu would expand by adding rice and beans! Ive never had a bad taco!  the vampiro tacos are my favorite!  Keep those tacos amazing!!!"}
{"text":"And here we go! I heard about this from a friend, and every time I pass this corner, I would always see a huge line so I knew it was inevitable that I was going to need to stop in and check out this new taco truck/ tent /outside restaurant venue. Let me just say, it did not disappoint! Contrary to the very few negative reviews that are on here, these tacos are amazing! Here is why, the corn tortillas they use are nice and thick and very very tasty. They are definitely of the street Taco variety so make sure you order enough, and my preference is the pork or pastor tacos, but both are very delicious. The meat is very tender, and the toppings are super fresh; you could taste the sweetness of the onion, you can taste the really ripe flavor of the guacamole and the Salsa's are well-balanced both in the medium and also the hot; a perfect mix of Smokey and Spice. Services pretty fast despite the fact that there are a ton of people ordering. If you're even within 10 or 15 miles of this place you have to make this one of your stops or literally the best tacos on the west side! I just finished eating, and I cannot wait for the next time I'm back here!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to try out this spot. I'm so glad I did. The Carne Asada Taco's are bomb.com. I absolutely loved them. This place is a game changer because there are no good street taco spots on the west side. All my favorite Taco spots are in east Phoenix or in Scottsdale. So happy and I'll be back very soon.  *Phoenix Foodies Approved"}
{"text":"Best tacos everrrrr! The tortillas are too good. The al pastor ones are my fav. They got the flavors just right!"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite tacos in town. Al pastor is amazing at tacos Tijuana    carne asada is very good as well. Taco Tuesday is buy one get one. Overall one one of the best taco joints in las vegas !"}
{"text":"A famous dumbass once remarked that if a certain presidential candidate was elected, there would be taco trucks on every corner.  To which I responded (after deadly serious deliberation), how soon can I vote for that candidate?!?!  Living in AZ for almost my entire life, the taco is as ubiquitous as the cactus.  Whether served at a food truck, at a takeout joint, or a full scale restaurant, the taco is perhaps the most democratic dish there is.  An inexpensive delicacy you can hold with your bare hands and devour in droves.  I know a great many who think Taco Bell is the tastiest and most legitimate taco joint in America, and to them I can only say how I sorry I am for you.  For it's the true old school street tacos that win my heart each and every time.  On National Taco Day, it would be unthinkable to not grab a delicious street taco or two and commemorate this day devoted to this gloriously simple, delicious food.  Tacos Tijuana is just a stone's throw from my office, but I'd not yet seen myself in.  At lunchtime on Taco Day, that was about to change.   On the northwest corner of 67th Avenue and Thunderbird, you'll find a Golden Spokes bike shop, a parking lot, and a blue tent.  Next to the blue tent, lies an old unassuming taco truck.  Opened in 2016, Tacos Tijuana is the creation of Adolfo Torres, whose father ran a similar taco truck operation back in Tijuana, Mexico.  I first found out about this truck through a great Phoenix New Times article in spring of 2017 which highlighted Adolfo's family journey to the valley.  Here they're largely sticking to the basics, so much so in fact that they make their own fresh tortillas daily in the truck.  And on the weekends there's apparently a churro cart that parks next to the taco truck and serves fresh churros (noted for future reference).    On Taco Day I was coming for the tacos, but a few menu items were unfamiliar to me.  One of them is a Mulita.  Basically it's a taco but with tortillas on top and bottom like a sandwich.  And there's also something called a Vampiro, which is similar to a tostada except the tortilla largely retains its taco shape, just in crunchy form.  So I got an Al Pastor (pork) Taco, plus a Carne Asada (steak) Vampiro, and an Al Pastor Mulita.  Total cost plus water and tax came to just $10.  Here you order at the entrance to the big blue tent, they give you a number and you grab a seat under the tent (there's maybe 30 seats total).  They brought mine out to my table with stunning speed.  Barely two minutes after I ordered, there it was.    I should note that all of their items come with guacamole, onion, cabbage, and tomatoes.  The Mulitas and Vampiros also have melted cheese.  I'm not sure what they're putting in their pork, but wow this was astonishingly good.  There's some great Al Pastor recipes I've had but this is way up the list.  The seasonings in the Carne Asada were also excellent and the house made corn tortillas were the perfect vehicle.  I particularly liked the Vampiro as the tortilla had a great crunchy texture.  All this goodness for $10 and I was in and out in 15 minutes.   In case you're wondering, the outdoor tent is not climate controlled in anyway so bare that in mind lest you think about sweating it out under the tent during the summer.  I got here at 11:30am and the lunch rush came on around Noon with the line getting about 15 deep.  That said, based on my experience it looks like they know how to crank out a bunch of food at lightning speed so your wait likely won't be long.  And believe me the Al Pastor alone is worth the wait.  The operation is simple, but the food and the prices are fantastic.  If Adolfo had one of his taco trucks on every corner, I think we'd all be that much prouder to live in America."}
{"text":"This place was very good.  Taste is as if you are eating tacos from Tijuana.  Very good, fast, friendly service.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"What!? Another good food place in my old hood. Man. A swear this area is getting a lot foodier ever since I moved from there.  Ok so do you really want me to compare Taco Tijuana and Taco Taco!? Or how about Tacos El Gordo, notice how I still haven't written my review for Tacos El Gordo I'll get to it eventually.  Taco Tijuana setup shop in the former Farm Basket place it is a small place.  I came here one night and well the parking lot was DARK, not well lit at all and hard to see parking lines.  The best lit parking is next to the bus stop.  There's a couple tables and chairs outside to enjoy your tacos on a nice cool night or if you want during those 100+ degree days.  When I came there was another only one other person eating which ended up being an employee.  There were 2 ladies tending the cashier and a handful of guys in the kitchen area.  The guy at the counter was pretty friendly and so was the one cashier that rang me up.  Having already eaten at another taco place earlier I still had room for more and wanted to try something different.  Looked at the menu and asked about 2 items that just looked different to me, I don't speak Spanish so it was pretty easy, just ask for something I've never ordered. I asked about the adobada and he pointed to the layers of pork meat on spit.  My response was \"Oh cool I'll have that.\" I'm so confused now I needed to Google it and I'm still confused, all good as long as it taste good.  For my second taco I just asked if they had a shoulder and how it was.  I ended up ordering it.    So my two orders were Taco De Adobada and Taco De Suadero http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-tijuana-las-vegas?select=2Yf2rbXK2qiaTDXpn4ZjFA#eFPW_eaFgixHKQKHNrkFbA both were very delicious, tender, topped with cilantro, onion, and their own sauce.  No pineapple but I guess you have to ask for it. It also came with some freshly hot of the grill green onions and pepper. After placing my order the cashier rang me up, she asked if I wanted to cup for soda and I said no.  Well she gave me a cup and I paid thinking it was a cup for water.  After looking at the receipt I noticed that I was charged for the soda, I just took the cup proceeded to the drink dispenser.  On my way to the drink dispenser I noticed the condiment area being pretty disappointing so I skipped it.  The drinks varied from your regular soda to Mexican drinks.   Not going to lie I do prefer these tacos by themselves, the way they were served to me, versus the other new taco spot down the road but as a whole I like the other guys more cause like those AT&T commercials MORE IS BETTER.  Both places make good tacos though and I'd eat at both so it's just a matter of what I feel like eating at the time."}
{"text":"Fresh homemade corn tortillas. Good price and decent size street tacos. The new location is nice."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing. I liked the pastor slightly better than the carne asada.  They came with a side of free grilled onions and peppers.   Solid food. We also had molita which was good but the tacos were the best.  Simple menu. Good"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. We drove 30 minutes to try these tacos and it was worth the drive. They definitely taste like the tacos on Tijuana. If you're in the area and you love tacos then you need to try this place."}
{"text":"Started off at the outdoor swapmeet and is now a nice little restaurant. Good quality food and restaurant is in the same style as el gordo. Good if you want to avoid the crowds that's always at el gord"}
{"text":"Well I've never been to Tijuana... yet... but I'm told Tacos Tijuana is close to experiencing the real deal; well, from a taco standpoint, anyways. So let's be honest, I could literally eat tacos every single day for the rest of my life and be happy, although on Taco Tuesday's (btw, whoever came up with \"Taco Tuesday\" is a genius, and I applaud you), I will drive to the ends of the earth for some amazing tacos.   Thanks to all my amazing fellow Yelpers, I came across Tacos Tijuana, and I set off on an adventure with my mom to get tacos... sure, it was 30 minutes away, but to me, everything in Phoenix is \"10 minutes away\" (which is how my mom agreed to come with, lol). We pulled into the parking lot on Thunderbird & 67th Ave, which you literally cannot miss it since it's jam-packed with cars and a huge line of people waiting to eat amazing tacos.   The menu is pretty straight-forward, with the options of tacos, quesadillas, mulita, or vampiro with the choice of beef or pork -- so even if there is a long line, it moves quickly, don't let that scare you away. Once you order, you have to attempt to not steal everyone else's food that comes out; it's agonizing seeing and smelling all the amazing food, only for it to not be yours... your stomach starts growling, your mouth salivates, but you just have to wait your turn. That's the only downfall -- waiting.   But once your food is ready, get ready for some of the most amazing tacos you've had in your life -- yup, in your life; I just went there. Granted I can't speak for the pork anything, but the steak?! My oh my is it tasty, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. My mom and I ordered one quesadilla (which I gave my mom a small bite before I ate the whole thing. Don't judge!), and 10 tacos... yes, ten. Your typical street taco size, kinda small but packed with immense flavor. (I may or may not have eaten 3 tacos after devouring the quesadilla... what can I say? I can eat!)   I will definitely be back to Tacos Tijuana... it is so good; my mouth is watering just writing this review. We also asked why they don't have the option of chicken or shrimp and apparently in Tijuana they only have steak and pork (didn't know this since I've never been to Tijuana), however we were told they were looking into adding to their menu due to everyone's requests, so yay!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good taco place (not from AZ) read good reviews on here so I came. My tacos were delicious! Just wish they had more choices on the meat they only have two, Asada (steak) and Al Pastor (Pork)."}
{"text":"I am From Los Angeles where there are more places to get tacos than there are Starbucks. Any how I ate here hoping I could get some of the same quality tacos that I find back in LA and did I hit the JACKPOT. These were amazing tacos I am looking forward to eating more. Now what elevates this to a five star review was the service and friendliness of the staff working at this place. I received my food quickly and with a smile. I had to leave quickly before I ordered more tacos than I needed to eat."}
{"text":"We came here on 7/19 & then again 7/20.. I'm not sure what \"Tacos el Gordo\" taste like, but these tacos are to die for! The Al Pastor/Adobada are THE BEST! I'm seriously going to have to make a trip to Vegas just for these tacos! SOOO GOOD!! The meat is nice and tender and sliced. i've never met Al Pastor/Adobada tacos like these. Out here in the Modesto/Stockton area there aren't very good places. I hope i see a taqueria out here with this quality of tacos soon. But yes, you must try these tacos. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I must admit,  that the wait was well worth it.  Place is packed.  The food was delicious and the red salsa was extremely  hot.  They have a churro vendor making them fresh they we're also very good.  A must for true asada and pastor tacos.  Will definitely  come back for more."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good  pastor or carne asada this is the spot. Their pastor cheese crisp is so good, also the corn tortillas are made fresh."}
{"text":"Perfect tacos, this is definitely a must try for all you pastor and asada foodies out there. Make note, they open at 5:30pm."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a street taco these are pretty good! Not exactly what I think of when I think of the tacos I have had in Mexico but I'd say its pretty close! There are about 5 items on the menu, 2 meats to chose from, pork or steak, and one way to top your taco off, guacamole, cilantro,   onion and tomato. So they keep things pretty basic. As far as the flavor goes the meat is juicy and tender, tortillas taste homemade, and the salsas are alright. For drinks you have your choice of Mexican Coke, Jarritos orange, apple, and sangria and horchata. This place is close to home and dang cheap so I can see myself coming here pretty often when I get those street taco cravings."}
{"text":"Best carne asada fries, best tacos, best Mexican drinks, amazing customer service. Best tacos in Las Vegas hands down."}
{"text":"Great street taco! Love the food and atmosphere they create here. Come by and enjoy the community. They get very busy in the evening come early."}
{"text":"My mom had ate here a few weeks ago and liked it. But, Omg...the grease on these are Disgusting! Even being cheap, they are not worth the money. Spend more and go to Carolinas.. Too bad they don't offee chicken and flour tortillas. Maybe that would have been better."}
{"text":"I heard reviews on this place so we decided to try it.  Walking in it was clean and they had music playing.  The menu is very simple which I like!  The food was amazing!  Good price.  The only critique I have is the cashier was not friendly.  We had never been there but he didn't really offer to tell us about the place and seemed it just want us to order and be on our way.  It wasn't busy so I felt he could have smiled and been friendly.  I would give a 5 but the cashier lost a star for them."}
{"text":"First time there, I thought this place was the bomb! The last few times, I was spitting out un chewable fat or grissel. Turn me off!"}
{"text":"My first time in. The place is quite small but clean. The food is not over priced. But you do have to wait a while to be served. Once you get your food its quite tasty. I dont think I will eat taco bell after this. I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is my second time at tacos Tijuana, and best believe I will be coming back. Great customer service and the food tops it all. Amazing tacos that are worth the price. This time I brought my boyfriend to try them out and I'm sure he'll love them as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Truly delicious. Among the best Al Pastor tacos in Vegas, without the huge lines of other places. The service is friendly and fast. I would have taken photos of the food, but it was all eaten up so fast that there was nothing left to photograph, except empty plates."}
{"text":"I'm not a taco guy normally but these are really good. The service was fast and the al pastor tacos (pork) were delicious, especially with the hot sauce. As of this writing, checking in on Yelp gets you one free taco.   They work very hard to keep the restaurant clean and you can tell they are just getting things up and running. Despite their best efforts, there is a bad smell in the air like raw sewage. I hope they get that fixed quickly because it detracts from the eating experience. We always eat outside when we visit just to avoid the smell.   Food is great, service is fast, and it is very inexpensive. Tacos Tijuana is excellent for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"2 for the service. Not because food isn't good but this is the 2nd time within 2 weeks.  Last week, November 7th service was not great and where's the beef came to mind when I received my tacos.  Today November 14, I waited 30 mins for my order because the tickets was misplaced. And not a sorry for the delay."}
{"text":"Finally a spot with authentic tasting tacos carne asada and al pastor,made with fresh tortillas  great friendly customer service and all the salsa at your reach."}
{"text":"All I can say is the Carne Asada tacos are so yummy. The set up is cute and clean. I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Homemade corn tortillas.... Do I need to write anything more?! Holy moly these tacos we're just amazing (and dirt cheap). This place is a little light on drink options or sides but it's still great for a quick bite"}
{"text":"When you walk in, you'll first notice the menu right above the kitchen counter. You might be greeted too by the kitchen staff and then directed to order with the cashier to your right. You can either pay first or after your meal if dining in.  The taco de adobada (marinated pork) is full of flavor and a must! Be sure to get some pineapple slices with it. You can also request for grilled chillies and onions.  I also enjoyed the soft and tender legua (beef tongue) tacos and the grilled asada taco. The lengua is the only taco priced at $2.25. All the other tacos are $2. See pic of the menu I posted.   There's plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Albuquerque and looking for a good taco place. After reading the reviews we were really excited to try these place and when we walked in we were extremely disappointed by the customer service from the cashier. The place was empty and the cashier was extremely rude, after taking our order we sat down and waited. Our food took a while to get to us and people who ordered after us were getting their food first (Ordered the same thing). When our finally got to our table it was wrong. The servers were very rude and stated they were going to correct our order, we waited another 15 minutes and nothing. We then got up and told them we were waiting on the corrected order and they said they will put in the order now. The server then came out and practically threw the corrected order on our table. We said thank you and she just walked away. We will never return here. The food was just like any other taco place, nothing special here."}
{"text":"Best taco truck on the west side! They work long hours in the heat to provide delicious tacos for all!"}
{"text":"Great little place to get a quick snack! Nice taco stand with friendly staff. Tacos were small and tasty. This is not the place to fill up on, but it was good. Well priced, $1.50 per taco, and quick service."}
{"text":"Oh my!  What amazing Taco's -- this place gives a new meaning to Taco Tuesday!  Take it to the next level, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously some of my FAVORITE tacos in the valley.  Very Simple menu: tacos, quesadillas, Mexican sodas - but high quality. The al pastor is spinning and shaved off fresh to order - incredible! Fresh toppings and the corn tortillas are soft and amazing! This is a new location and needs so support - go try it!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to this place for Taco Tuesday and I am extremely grateful for this! The food was amazing, probably some of best tacos I have ever had. I got the carne asada tacos with everything on them, I am a bigger guy so I would suggest 3 to 4 tacos to really fill you up. Get yourself a coke in a glass bottle and enjoy. Highly recommend and suggest to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ok, being a carne asada burrito aficionado from San Diego California, I judge Mexican restaurants on this one simple order, well this and the restaurant's salsa.  I always search for the best Mexican restaurant when I move from place to place since I am a military man so I have to tell you, this place isn't too bad.  I stopped here because of the good reviews so I wanted to test the authenticity.  First, let me judge the restaurant experience before the food quality:  - Cleanliness:  8 (it's an outside establishment) - Amenities:  N/A - Timeliness:  7  (it was worth the wait) - Price:  8 (for what you're getting, it's great) - Atmosphere:  N/A (it's outside. 67th Ave. and Thunderbird) - Courtesy of Employees:  8 - Quality of Food:  8  Let's cut to the quality of food.  I expect authentic carne asada to be the deciding factor.  The tacos are quite small, but guess what, when you order Mexican food from authentic San Diego/Tijuana, your street tacos are just like that.  Great job!  The tacos and quesadillas that I ordered were fantastic.  I would recommend this place if you have the extra 15 minutes on the way home.  This food will bring you right back to the authentic Mexican origins.  Yummm!  One more thing, because they operate out of a food truck (please expand), you will only get a dinner service."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!!  There is always a line, so that tells you how good they are!! Several great different tacos to try , never a disappointment always good. This is a food truck in a parking lot but they do offer covered seating  but it fills up fast and in the summer it will get warm out there,  so get them to go !?"}
{"text":"In town from CA. Food was amazing! We went twice on Friday! Lunch & Dinner. Recommend it! Although it is an outside venue, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"asked to refill the sauce and the answer was to wait about 10 minutes because it's busy....in the meantime i will stare at my tacos....otherwise love the food and the simplicity of the menu...if it was not so cold i would eat at the food truck location"}
{"text":"The second best Mexican street taco I've tried here in AZ.(Tacos Calafia hands down the best)   If it weren't for the long wait to order, and even longer wait to receive food, I would have given it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"For those of you who don't like the craziness and the hustle and bustle of Tacos El Gordo on Charleston....this is a great alternative. Excuse me, I wouldn't even call this an alternative....I would compare this as their Siamese twins.  Their Al Pastor (adobada) tacos are made exactly like El Gordo's. Carne Asada with that guac....on point. Yum!!!!!! Definitely come here for your street tacos craving.   If you come during peak hours...be prepared to wait for a table since this place CAN get a bit dirty and messy....I didn't see any workers here trying to clear/clean tables. We were lucky enough to find the last CLEAN table."}
{"text":"I always went here to grab lunch every now and then while I was attending school in the area.  Their carne asada fries are my go to!  It's loaded with a generous amount of beef, cheese, crema and guacamole.  The fries are always crispy and the beef is well seasoned.  Squeeze a bit of lime on top to bring out the flavor of the avocado and you have a little piece of heaven.  ...even if that piece of heaven makes you hit the gym hard the next few days.  Their size small is quite big!  It's a good deal for $5.39 after tax."}
{"text":"For all the reviews, I was disappointed over all. You ordered at a stand, wait for you number to be called and either sit out side or go on your way. The main think lacking was friendliness. Other than that the tacos were rather bland for my tastes. Very thing seemed clean enough in the food trunk and the tacos looked amazingly. Was just disappointed with the expectation I had verses the reality."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. It was clean and lit up to make a \"simple\" food truck become so much more. Everyone smiles and the food is fresh. I have never had tortillas like theirs and is was amazing!! The meat has so much flavor! Perfect!!! Thank you Tacos Tijuana !"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! You cannot order just 1, you need like 4 or 5, I wish they would not have taken away the large tents with the upcoming heat-  however, we will keep going back over and over again :)"}
{"text":"Excellent mexican food! As much as I love their carne asada tacos, the main thing I go there for is the pastor quesadilla. If you have not tried the pastor quesadilla you are missing out. Such a great flavor!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a local place that serves really good street tacos. This place came up in my list many times, but I foolishly passed on it because it's a food truck. I am sorry that I didn't try this earlier. The tacos are legit!! They are delicious and the service is great too! I'll definitely be making more stops here. The downfall is the limited seating. However the food is so good, that people don't care. They'll eat standing up. Luckily, I was able to score a seat for myself. I highly recommend Tacos Tijuana! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Al pastor and carne asada are awesome."}
{"text":"Like others are saying, they are far from organized which will kill a place with good food. 25 min after I ordered I ask d the waitress where my food was. She comes back to ask what I ordered and says they gave me the wrong number. Seems to be a trend"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for lunch on a whim before heading to the airport.  Man was I glad we did.  Super friendly staff and excellent food.  We tried several tacos, to include lengua, carne asada, and tripe, but their adobada was easily the best.  Great little place to try out right off the strip."}
{"text":"Little taco stands like this make life so much better. The people are super friendly, and the food.....it should be classified as a religious experience. Since moving to Pheonix 3 years ago I always make a point to stop by as many random taco spots as possible. Where most are good, Tacos Tijuana is one that I would drive across the state for. The street tacos are just what you need in your life. Juicy, perfect asada and al pastor, with fresh onions and guac. The mulitas (Little quesadilla sandwiches) are something I didn't know I needed until I had them. Same amazing asada or al pastor but with cheese sandwiched between two street taco shells.  Their salsas are incredible with the \"hot\" salsa actually having real heat that makes your nose tickle and your mouth water. Their is a usually a line but with service this fast the waits are minimal. You need this in your life."}
{"text":"I got 3 Taco Pastors and one Asada.  The Pastor was great!  Next time I will get 4 of them.  Get the Orange sauce.  No idea what it was, but it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Best carne asada. I get the quesadilla but with easy onions and cilantro (they don't mess around). Curiosity got me, and I had to figure out why they had ketchup at the tables. Nope, it's not ketchup and don't shake it lol. Both red and green salsas are amazing. The red is actually HOT. Score. They told us it would be a 30 min wait, and it was actually 10 minutes. Yes, we were going to wait 30 mins for tacos and a quesadilla. It's that good."}
{"text":"Don't let the food truck and tent in a parking lot fool you like it almost did us! This place is so good we had it twice ... in one day! (Before you think 'who has Mexican twice in one night' ... my dietitian wife does when it's this good!)"}
{"text":"This is a really good place for authentic TJ style tacos.  Just like I used to buy on the streets of Tijuana and Rosarita.  Al Pastor and Carne Asada with fresh Pico and salsas.  Simple menu, fresh tortillas, decent low prices, this place is tops in Glendale and Phoenix."}
{"text":"These are really good tacos. We came across the place by chance one night and figured out that if it was packed then it must be good.  Was not disappointed.  The carne asada tacos are very tasty.  The pastor tacos are quite good and are prepared the traditional Mexican way, in a trompo.  There is limited seating because it is usually busy.  We enjoyed the tacos and the quesadilla for the kiddo.  These are amongst the best tacos in the Phoenix metro area.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great street size tacos! Very limited options, Carne Asada or Al Pastor (spicy pork) & no rice or beans. Very tasty, usually pretty quick to get your order out."}
{"text":"Taco Tijuana, you have made me a firm believer that not all El Pastor is created equal. On my first visit I tried the El Pastor, Cabeza, and Lengua tacos. Man the tenderness and flavor of all three meats were good down to the last bite! The El Pastor had tons of flavor and it still had the juices to it. A little greasy but isn't that what gives it its juicy flavor? All their tacos are 2 bucks except for one which is 2.25. I think its either the Cabeza or Lengua.   Another plus is that they ask you if you want grilled chiles and green onions to go with your tacos. Hell yeah! Why would you say no to such grilled goodness? Also don't forget about asking for a little slice of pineapple to add to your Pastor Tacos. Gives it that little bit of sweet kick to it.  As for their extra fixins, well all they have are cut up limes and sliced radishes. I was hoping they would have more options like onions, cilantro, and salsa along with pickled jalapenos and carrots. Im sure for the salsa you can ask for some on the side. This is probably the only area where they lose the one star because there are other places where you get all these readily accessible.  Service is something worth mentioning. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with a \"Hola! Buenos Tardes/Noches!\" If you just so happen to eat there, they usually come around asking if everything is ok and grab your empty tray of garbage to put away if you are done. These little things that they do actually go a long way in regards to remembering a pleasant experience.  Some tidbits: From memory I recall them having about 8 booths inside and a couple tables outside, so at really busy times you might not be able to even sit down to eat. Their two bathrooms are singular, meaning you can only have one gal and guy occupying them at one time. For their drinks you have Pepsi products, Tamarindo, Jamaica, Horchata, and Pina. Im wondering why they don't have Orange Bang.  The hours they are open are not quite established yet and its obvious for they don't have anything on their doors to indicate this. For now what they have told me is that they open everyday at 10 am and close at 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights. I recommend that you give them a call before heading out there the other days if you are out and about late so you don't make a wasted trip.  So overall, TT you will win the battle with Arby's next door most days because I do happen to like a roast beef sandwich every now and then. But to most people, El Pastor will beat out roast beef any day and I don't blame them."}
{"text":"I love tacos, and I like to frequent any and all taco stands that I hear of in Arizona; without a doubt these are the BEST tacos I've had! The prices are great too, especially for the quality."}
{"text":"Bomb street tacos. Few options. Store typically has a smell that I am not fond of. I wish they had better salsas"}
{"text":"This place is just hands down the best!!! Always amazing service and the food can fill you up."}
{"text":"This place rocks.... Finally a real Mexican hole in the wall type place with real good food."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place and omg it was so good!!! We ordered the corn in a cup, burrito , and tacos. The pastor was amazing,  the taco de tripas  (extra crunchy) was to die for and the tacos de asada were soft and perfect.  They have all the fixing and are fresh. Cucumbers,  radishes,  and lemons go well with the tacos. I've been to many taco places and this one is one of the best ones. The meats are tasty and well cooked. They know what they are doing here"}
{"text":"Phoenaminal Carney Assad tacos.  I frequent Mexico and this place is legit!  Try any tacos or quesadilla."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place one more time... The last time that we came down here our food was just horrible. Everyone kept saying to give it a second chance so we finally decided to do so...  As soon as we entered, they greeted us with a smile. They made us feel very welcomed. I decided to order two al pastor tacos and two asada tacos. They were pretty quick in making it and they asked me if I wanted it with everything (salsa, cebolla, cilantro). I said yes. I noticed that they raised their prices since the last time that we came in. Once we paid I noticed that they didn't have a salsa bar which is a total bummer. I looove extra salsa on my tacos even if it already comes included. I hate the fact that you have to ask them and when you do they only give you one or two at the most. The asada tacos were pretty good. I was more interested in the al pastor tacos...well they weren't the BEST al pastor but they were better than other places that I've tried out.   This isn't my favorite taco spot but it will do for now..."}
{"text":"Great tacos and vampiros. Closest thing to the tacos that I had in Guadalajara. Absolutely delicious. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb! I came here because Havana Express was closed. GOOD CALL!! Forget all the fancy, chef-y words like \"authentic\" \"on point\" and all that crap. They're just [expletive delered] GOOD! I was there on Taco Tuesday, got two Asada tacos and two adobado. Dad gum excellent! GO!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous off the strip atmosphere, makes you feel like a local. Extremely welcoming it's a must stop for me every time I go to Vegas. It's seriously an authentic taco  from Mexico. Especially the tacos de al pastor with the green sauce... Can't wait to stop by next month"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and grab some tacos quick, excellent service and food. Can't beat the prices either! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gahhhh so good. Just like the street tacos in TJ  they give you grilled onions and roasted peppers also yummm. Now all they need is to make some bacon wrapped hot dogs TJ style"}
{"text":"It's taco's...thick corn tortilla's are used vs. a double or triple taco I've seen at other places that serve a street type of taco. You get steak or pork, I had both and both were good but preferred the flavor of the pork.  They have a few other very limited options (see menu pictures). They have a few drinks options including horchata.   They keep the menu very basic and because of that they serve customers quickly and they know what they are doing. I'll be back.  They do accept credit cards FYI. Lots of seating inside and some on the patio."}
{"text":"The one and only place for your pastor street tacos! I can't find a better tasting fresh made corn tortilla than this corner lot here, and I keep coming back for more. I always order the basic tacos, and 4 fills me up fast, but do try the muleta or vampiro if you're feeling different. The muleta is meat sandwiched between two corn tortillas, and the vampiro is finished on the griddle for a hard shell (like a tostada). Major plus: 20% off on Taco Tuesdays ;)"}
{"text":"AMMMMAZING!!! I will never have tacos anywhere else when I'm in Vegas. Everything is so fresh & they make their own tortillas! I had the lengua, cabeza and carne Asada, all were delicious."}
{"text":"FIRST TIMER HERE!!!   We were invited by are group of friends to celebrate something ...I can't remember what exactly but either way it was a nice take on TACOS!!!  People were friendly and the staff was nice and pleasant!! I had a few different things from the menu and they were all pretty good the only thing I would hope for is a little more spice in the salsa!!! Otherwise great place whenever your feeling the urge for good clean authentic tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Street tacos...carne asada...simple...delish..cheap.  What more to say?  Only a few items on menu.  Take a few things...perfect them... and you don't need a bigger menu! Great place."}
{"text":"Very good I tried both carne asada and pastor both were good but the Pastor was the winner.. I liked the cut limes never had limes with my street tacos it also really hit the mark. I normally don't care for corn tortillas  but these were good also great flavor and very fresh. The hot sauces green mold red hot were both good and had a great flavor with a good spice level to them. I have to be very honest I used to go to a place called taco head but this place is a lot better. I am looking forward to taking my wife Ashley here very soon.. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.."}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious,  the tortillas are so good.  The hot red salsa is awesome,so spicy but can't stop eating it"}
{"text":"Their carne asada burrito is to die for, seriously one of the best burritos I've had in my life! I cant tell what it is, I think it's their sour cream but something makes it a little spicy but way good"}
{"text":"These tacos were amazing. Right next to a great coffee shop it was so amazing. Their salsa was so good too!"}
{"text":"Man it says is open and damn place is closed I was gonna give them a chance and try them out but fuck this place straight wack I went to brush fire tacos instead!!!!"}
{"text":"Deducted a star for portion per price. Been here twice. They are good street tacos. Could be a little more affordable for the portion. They are definitely yummy!!! Hubby and I got chicken and pork. Tasty! Will be returning."}
{"text":"Really good. Really cheap. Really fast. The seating area and everything is a little messy and needs better clean up. But not that bad. If you want a typical TJ street taco, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great little place place with indoor and outdoor seating. Best street taco's I've tasted in a well on Bell Rd. If coming at lunch time arrive before noon rush. I like the steak taco myself. I like the hot salsa as well. Enjoy.."}
{"text":"To start off my wife and I were craving street tacos and we didn't feel like cooking them ourselves we have to do this because we cannot find a taco shop that actually knows how to make a customer a respectable street taco for the price they charge. After reading on yelp it seemed this place was supposedly decent after reading reviews hoping we wouldn't get the crappy food that some reviews suggested and we would be given some at least decent food at worse well I'll be damned if we didn't spend an incredible amount for 12 tacos (6/carne asada, 4/pork, 2/chicken) freaking $31.00 total. Well I am just disgusted companies get away with serving this quality of food and still can keep the lights on this stuff was absolute garbage the beef that they call carne asada has to be the cheapest grade of meat you can get soooo much fat and grizzle by the time I picked all that waste off I didn't hardly have a pile of meat left in my taco I don't purchase carne asada tacos to be given fat, grizzle, mushy vegetables (idk wth that was I guess it's their salsa another disgusting tasting product), and mushy shells (they were disintegrated to nothing so you couldn't even pick the taco up to eat) the chicken was just about the same plain, grizzle, and fat I didn't even want to try the pork at this point but the pork tacos messed up my wife's stomach so folks please save yourself the trouble and go back your normal place at least you know what you'll get. I am also allergic to beans telling them this you think they would've payed attention a little bit to what they were doing and try not to cross contaminate our food but no that didn't happen some where along the line someone got beans on some of the tacos not a lot but heck it doesn't take much for me to have an allergic reaction! my throat swells cutting off my air supply then I die just because someone was to lazy to care what they were doing. pay attention when people say they have allergies it's not always because they don't like your specific product. The pale skinned guy at the front acted as if we were bothering him by entering the place and wanting to order some food from this place that serves food he's probably in the wrong industry if he doesn't like to deal with people last and final deal about this place was how stingy they were with there hot sauces we purchased 12 remind you we asked for some sauce we were asked how many said a couple of each they only have red or green the light skinned guy said one each I was like wth at least 2 a piece please he made some kind of face and noises and his worker gave us what we asked for but really is the extra hot sauces savings gonna save the place from tanking. After my 1 1/2 asada tacos and the couple bites I had of a chicken I trashed my share of this garbage my wonderful wife went in kitchen and made me the tacos that are in the pictures now those were awesome and tasted like something beware beware beware is all that can be said have a good one"}
{"text":"This was our first time . Steak tacos were great, casadilla was outstanding . Close by need to try Vampiros and Mulitas"}
{"text":"I have give them a five star for their Al Pastor, because I'm very impressed with their creation, and this is my favorite Al Pastor in the Las Vegas Valley.      One final thing,  I\"m happy when the manager and/or owners of business takes the time for replying back on what they can do to make things better for their customers.  This is what called customer service, and I'm very happy to say Taco Tijuana cares."}
{"text":"For those going for the first time it's on the North West corner behind some ice cream spot. I went on a Tuesday around 8pm. I ordered 2 asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. It took 30 minutes to get my 4 tacos and the meat was cold/warm..why? Lol The taste of the tortillas stood out to me the most than the meat. My grandma is all about lard in whatever she cooks and these tortillas has that taste. The tacos were around $2 each so $8 total for my 4 tacos."}
{"text":"My family said this place was all the rave. Don't get me wrong, they are good tacos but not sure the price and lack of choices are what I was expecting. I ate at the food truck and the quality seemed better. IMO the restaurant needs more selections or stick to food trucks."}
{"text":"I had one Al Pastor (pork) and two carne asada tacos for my first Tacos Tijuana taco truck experience. Every component of these tacos was fresh and lively with flavor--I especially loved the burst of cilantro as it complimented the carne asada exceptionally well.   These are exceptionally good tacos from their native land, by comparison to that of chain restaurant Filiberto's/Taco Bell standards. It took a little longer to get my tacos as they were freshly made on their corn tortillas, but it was worth it as nothing was pre-made or stale-tasting.  If you like fresh guacamole, cilantro, spicy and full-bodied meat texture and flavors and tacos that are delicious WITHOUT a drowning of salsa...this place is for you! (I cannot wait to go back before I move away from Arizona!)"}
{"text":"OMAGAH! My husband and I pretty much live here! Tacos are so dang good it's dangerous! The Al Pastor... MUST HAVE!! I don't think I will ever get tired of this place. Definite YES PLEASE!! I've tried almost every darn taco place in Vegas and you just can't find tacos like Cali street tacos... unless you come here! They fill your plate just like home and have great prices."}
{"text":"Great street tacos. Loved the homemade corn tortillas.  Good salsa as well. Nice quick meal for a reasonable price. Had driven past here several times and decided to finally stop. wasn't disappointed. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place has a set up similar to Taco y Taco and Tacos El Gordo. Similar tacos as well, where they come with onion and cilantro, salsa and guacamole with a hand made tortilla.   $23 for 4 tacos, side of rice and a burrito. Geeezus, like the thing I dislike most about vegas is all the Mexican food and tacos is hella overpriced here. Like $2.50 for one Asada taco that's freaking stupid. I just want meat and onion cilantro and salsa. Don't give a crap about no guacamole or whatever. But your charging me these stupid prices because y'all don't have it as an option to get a regular taco. And if your going to charge $2.50 for a taco you should be using the thicker ranchero type of meat not the cheap thin meat with a ton of fat in it.   Pinches tacos, la bonita supermarket, Asada up north... have a lot better Asada tacos honestly, wasn't a fan of the Asada tacos here. The rice was amazing but the meat wasn't the best. I've tasted a lot better. This place didn't impress me at all."}
{"text":"Took 50 minutes for 3 street style tacos.  Nuff said.  Doesn't matter what things taste like when my mouth is bitter from impatience.   Maybe warn gringos that their food will take a lot longer?"}
{"text":"Really great food and quick. This is a food truck permanently put in place. I would say that the food is a bit small but very tasty."}
{"text":"Original TJ street tacos and everything is good.  Basic menu with two meat options Al Pastor (pork) or Carne Asada (Steak).  No fountain drinks. They have bottled Mexican Coke, Jarritos orange, apple, and sangria. They also have fresh horchata.   My only complaint is the smell when you walk in and I believe it's from the cleaning solution they use on the tables or what they mop on the floors. They need to air the place out.   Their food though simple and delicious."}
{"text":"This place captures the essence of Tijuana tacos perfectly. Very meaty , flavorful , spicy and cheap.  What a treat , and still not overrun by hipsters .  Give them a try"}
{"text":"Very limited choices. Just carne asada and pastor, however, they do it well. The inside is bare bones just some backyard tables and a trash can that reminds me of Oscar the grouch. I am so grateful this is close to home as I crave street tacos often. I just wish they had chicken as well!"}
{"text":"I love Tacos Tijuana. I come every Monday to see if they might be open that day. I always get 10 tacos and a Horchata, take it home, and flick on some good anime."}
{"text":"The tacos were really good.  However I thought the pastor quesadilla was the best thing! The red salsa was super spicy had my husband sweating the whole meal,  but he kept eating it any way."}
{"text":"New to the area, drove by this place various times of the day, and it had a lot of vehicles.  So we figured it was good, so one night we decided to eat there, we arrived and the good part was they accept credit or debit cards, we thought it was expensive for the quanity we purchased six tacos, a coke and a flat taco, which total approx $16.00 which to me that is a lot for STREET TACOS not regular Tacos.  They were small.  The spicy Salsa people talk about is awful what they did is placed what seems like Chili de Arbor in a blender with seasoning, which did not get strained.  Overall we will not support that establishment."}
{"text":"These tacos give tacos Mexico a run for their money as far as disgusting goes. I ordered two tacos one of el pastor and the other of lengua to go. When I opened the el pastor it was so gross. The meat was pink and not fully cooked. The lengua one felt like the meat was old. I ate this in the afternoon at 4pm. The worst part... was that they were just soaked in grease. I have never even had a burger stain a paper bag as much as two tacos did to the plastic wrapper. To give you an image of how it looks like. Imagine a piece of tracing paper soaked in water. They weren't even good.  It's as if before putting the tacos in the plate they let them swim in grease. The grease took the flavor away. Won't be going here anymore. A completely disgrace as far as tacos go. At least tacos Mexicos were stale and edible with somewhat flavor. Tacos Tijuana at the swat meet taste a little better. Don't come here go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Tacos are $1.75 and are packed with meat and flavor. I always ask for grilled peppers to spice it up! They have a few other items on the menu that are bomb as well!  Definitely stop by this food truck for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I loved it there!! Super delicious food and the atmosphere is wonderful!! Very Clean and Friendly! We had steak tacos and a quesadilla....all was Amazing & Fresh!! We will definitely be back!! And the churro cart nearby for dessert was Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Simple menu. No frills. Straight up street tacos. Delicious! Beware of the hot sauce in the red bottle. It's muy caliente, but oh so good!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Simple menu but they do it right. I've had the tacos and quesadilla al pastor and carne asada and they're delicious. They give you one corn tortilla instead of two which I am not used to and there are no radishes but it's not that big a deal to me."}
{"text":"Being a local, loyal customer for almost 3 years, tonight was the last time I come here. Taco Tijuana was the first thing that came into mind to eat after an incredible Vegas Golden Knights series.   My brother and I took an Uber from the T-Mobile Arena to come across that our adovada/pastor fries that we ordered, were mainly fries and only fries. The adovada/pastor fries had hardly any meat or the other toppings that are normally added the past few years that I've gone. As soon as I noticed the poor fries after taking several bites, nicely, I immediately took them back to the cashier by the name of Ana. Once I took them back to the cashier, I told her about the situation and she instantly took them back to the cooks to fix it.   As the cooks appeared to finish my new order of fries, Ana appeared to grab the order as they were all laughing for what ever reason. She walked up to the table that we were sitting at and gave me the order. She sarcastically made sure that I looked at them and made sure I was satisfied. The fries looked perfectly fine to me since they were covered with the salsa. As soon as I got halfway to the bottom I noticed why the employees were all laughing, they had filled my fries with the old, crunchy, greasy bits of meat that fall on to the grill after cutting it. I got up and left, didn't make a deal out of it.  Never again will I come to this place."}
{"text":"stopped by the other night and I am glad I did.    love the tacos.   keep up the good work.     Will spread the word.      only ten minutes away.    hope you don't get sick of seeing me. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place randomly.. All I have to say they are close or even better than tijuana tacos.  I had a Carne asada, tripas, and buche, meat is flavored and juicy.  two thumbs up on this one.  i soooooo recommend this place."}
{"text":"i cant stop going the food is awesome, and great deal. friendly people and the meat is fresher than other restaurants.  i eat mexican often, and this is the place..."}
{"text":"Y'all need to come stop over and try these tacos!!!! I can finally say Arizona as a good place to eat tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"There 5 things on the menu to eat. Its what they make and tgey ar all fantastic. I think they hand make the yellow corn tortillas. They taste just like the ones grandma used to make. The tacos are traditional, Not american . (monster sized) .. which is fine they are less.than $2 a piece so you can order 6 or 7 for less.than $10. They have all the mexican sodas in the tall glass bottles. Coke sangria orange the horchate is also real. Not the syrup mix in a recirculation tak. They have the giant jars with ladels like the jugo carts use. Besides being in a clean open dining room. If you blind folded me the place sounds and smells like a good taco stand in Culiacan. Oh n they even give key limes, Carmelized onions and seared peppers. I expect limes to squeeze on my tacos but key limes are a high class touch. We ate everything here n it was great. We have a new taco tuesday spot in the north valley."}
{"text":"This is by far the best tacos in a world phx my kids loved it  will be coming her often. The salsa was perfect"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and I was not impressed. salsas not good, one way to spicy the other one too watery. Tacos didn't have guacamole like they said. They said to wait for the guacamole but it never arrived. Personally, I think a good taco must have a delicious salsa. The 2 stars are for the homemade tortillas. It's really not hard to make good salsa."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down, the tacos are not as good, the meat isnt at tender and they dont serve the same I dont go as much anymore"}
{"text":"First time here, but definitely not the last. I hear people come to this place from all over the valley because they're that good! I'm just sad we hadn't tried it sooner, especially since we live a mile and a half away! I got tacos al pastor and Bri got carne asada, and the corn tortillas are amazing! Next time I'm going to try the vampiros."}
{"text":"This is an AWESOME no frills place. Very simple menu, 2 meats, served in 3 different ways. Pastor (pork) or steak. I preferred the pastor. They also have several salsa's on the side if you want a little variety. As far as servings, while they're smaller tacos, they're pretty good for the prices. Now that i've ordered everything, I'd probably get 3 tacos and a mulito or vampiro (depending on your taste). I preferred the toasted one... I can't remember which one it is.   Also, free taco with checkin! Great place, great price, just don't expect atmosphere. If i'm not mistaken, there was no music when we were in there."}
{"text":"The taco here were delicious and truly authentic Mexican style!!!   Honestly, what makes an awesome taco is handmade, fresh tortillas. And Tacos Tijuana nails it! The tortillas are made in house and have that fresh maize taste with the perfect consistency.  To add, they have pretty awesome al pastor. I have yet to try their carne asada, but their al pastor alone  is enough to come back for. So yummy (:     The only slight downside is that I just wish they had more variety of meat. They only serve al pastor and carne asada, but it seems to be working for them. They were generating a small crowd when I stopped by.   Anywho! I definitely recommend stopping by Tacos Tijuana if you're stopping by in the area. It's really worth it-- prices are great!"}
{"text":"(TL; DR) Well if you just want the gist, this is a family own and operated taco stand that sets itself apart from a lot of the Mexican restaurants and trucks in town. Quality ingredients are used throughout and the flavors definitely pack a punch. Highly recommended.   Let's start with the thing that captivates the most from the get go. You can't help but to love the homemade vibe this place has. At glance you would think that this is just another greasy, low quality, post boozing at the club taco stand to appease your late night cravings. However, you'd be wrong all along because the charm and warmth in which you are greeted at this family own and operated Mexican food truck is quite welcoming and inviting. You'd be also happy to know that they take card as opposed to the limiting cash-only joints.   The beverages are limited to some canned sodas and bottled water. The bottles of water are big, however, which is a nice difference from the standard two-sips bottles you get at most places.  The service is fast and I mean jimmy johns record breaking fast. I must've waited no more than 5 minutes when our order was ready.  My wife and I ordered a pastor quesadilla and two mulitas (small quesadillas; one pastor, one carne asada) the pastor is full of flavor and the \"tanginess\" you'd expect from quality pastor meat. It's important to point out that this is NOT (as many lazy Mexican restaurants do) just carne asada doused in some unidentified liquid, chopped up and grilled to con you into thinking it is pastor. Most places that serve pastor, seem to just use a store-bought marinade and pour it onto the meat as it cooks on the grill.  This is the real deal my friends, they carve the meat from an artifact that's known in Mexico as \"trompo\" (commonly known as the vertical broiler used to cook gyro meat) and onto your freshly handmade tortillas. Let me repeat that, handmade tortillas. The meat has been marinated for hours before it's stacked up high and slowly cooked to perfection. The carne asada is also not your run of the mill asada, it is top notch sliced meat cooked just right. It's not chewy and it packs a lot of flavor. If I was to make a guess, I'd say they use rib eye meat.  What's also comforting is that the menu is not littered with 50 different items that make you stare into oblivion and thus rushing you into ordering something you are not too sure about.  It is menus like these that make the dining experience enjoyable. Who cares if other taco shops can make 15 types of quesadillas? Simplicity my friends, is king and I hope they keep the menu like it is for as long as possible. I see this place becoming a neighborhood staple in the near future.  They've definitely made me a loyal customer."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago, I took the wifey to Tacos El Gordo and got her hooked on al pastor. Ever since then, she's wanting to try more and more taco spots with me. Yeah, I know...awesome, right?! Taco Tijuana came up on Talk a while back and we decided to hit it up. It's a small joint located right off Eastern & Trop. I imagine it gets busy in here at times and much like TEG, you might have trouble finding a seat during their peak times.   I ordered a couple adobada tacos and an asada taco. The asada had great flavor and was spicier than most I've tried, but it was slightly dry. I came here mainly for the adobada though and that's where the money's at. It's a bit greasier then I'm used to but I think that only adds to the overall taco goodness. It is extremely moist and tender, a bit spicier than most and like the asada, these guys really pack some meat on for $2! About the only thing I didn't like about it was the pineapple. I dig the pineapple sweetness with the spicy pork but if you look at the picture, they kinda just slap a big square stick of it on the taco. I prefer the smaller chunks but I'm sure that can be requested.   They also have really great customer service. Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was organized and clean. The lack of a salsa bar is a bit disappointing but since the tacos were on point, it's not a huge deal. If you're in the area, Taco Tijuana is definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Food is fresh and has a great taste! Menu is nothing fancy but simple. My new place for tacos!"}
{"text":"Took my son here on saturday, it was outstanding, the al pastor tacos and carne were fantastic will def be going back! the homemade corn tortillas were amazing!! love this place!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos at a great price.  No phone to call in an order and long wait times.  I would recommend you give this place a try if you have time to burn."}
{"text":"The tacos are good, they're pretty fast. But not \"the best\" ... I'm huge on texture and the tortillas were off for me personally. I would eat them again because of their proximity."}
{"text":"Very delicious tacos, for sure top 3 in AZ. We came in on a week day the found out the have Birria on the weekend so we came in again and it was all very good again. The only reason i gave this a 4 and almost a 3 star its because the girl up front had a very shitty attitude and it looked like she didnt want to be there and it really kills the vibe of the place. I wish i could really give this place 5 stars because the food is super good but the service its the total opposite of its food."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place enroute to the strip. Family style Mexican place (my favorite types). I had a few carneasada tacos $2/ea. They were goooooood. I guess I am not that experienced to really criticize tacos, but I know what Iike. Fresh meat, cilantro, onions, taco and guacamole will do it for me. loved this place and loved the fact I was treated sith kindmess from the moment I walked in as a lost Japanese kid with little to no knowledge of mexican foods... they prep your order right in front of you Nd have it ready immediately. .. great stuff I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great tacos, hand made tortillas. Great tease, will be coming back to this place, it was a drive to get here but worth it"}
{"text":"Bomb tacos !!! You will keep coming back. My favorite are the carne asada tacos, they make their own tortillas and they delicious"}
{"text":"I am completely DUMBFOUNDED.  My wife and I pride ourselves on finding the best local Mexican joints when we travel.  We got married in Mexico because even though we are Gringos,  we love MEXICAN FOOD like there is no tomorrow! We read the Yelp reviews and couldn't get to Taco Tijuana fast enough.  When we got there,  it was bright and clean.  I guess that's worth the one star minimum you must give.  The picture menu up on the wall to order from looked like everything was pretty much the same dish with a different Spanish word under it.  After several frustrating minutes of trying to figure out what was actually on the menu,  my wife,  who speaks a marginal amount of Spanish tried to speak to the people who take your order at the counter.  Hearing the confusion,  another customer kindly started translating for her to have some basic questions answered.  Questions such as, \"What comes in the burrito you have pictured?\"  (Um,  shouldn't it be listed?!) and \"Do you have any cups for water?\"  (The answer was No!).  What we did find out was the menu consists of authentic Tijuana tacos.  Now,  I don't know about you,  but now that I think about it,  Tijuana isn't exactly known for being a ritzy destination get-away.  Quite the opposite. Now I understand why they chose to name their restaurant after that specific city.  It is low rent and so are all the meat choices at  Taco Tijuana.  Would you like a tounge taco?  How `bout a pig stomach lining taco?  Would you care for a brain taco or some intestinal  tacos?  They did have a version of Carne Asada,  the flavor was good,  but the meat was clearly the grisly stuff  some other butcher threw away.  There was no pollo/  chicken,  no carnitas  (they had \"pastor\"  but  God only knows why it was dyed a pink/red color. It tasted even worse when they gave a sample. ) Basically,  it was odd parts of a cow on your taco---or bust.  We ended up trying to order the safest bet  (the Asada)  but had to spit most of the cartilage laden meat out.  Needless to say,  we will never return.  (As a side note,  even though the employees didn't really speak much/any English,  they were all extremely nice.  But at the end of the day,  if you have nice employees and terrible quality food,  it just doesn't matter.)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I tried this place. Everything is fresh made and the prices are great. The set up reminds me of Tacos El Gordo. They offer asada, al pastor, lengua, buche and sosa tacos, burritos and sopas. It's worth a stop by if your looking for tacos. This location was a Farm Basket years ago (right behind Arbys).  PROS: Buche taco             Al Pastor taco             Lengua taco  CONS: Not much atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Por el precio de por los tacos es caro y lo peor de todo que ni siquiera tienen salsa  la tienes que pedir y te dan un micro vasito no lo recomiendo la carne muy seca"}
{"text":"Drove in by chance and absolutely DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Very tasty and fresh.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME come check it out great tacos good food awesome. Try the Sangria."}
{"text":"First time their tonight   had the  quesadilla  and the cana asada tacos    i thought the taste was good  but my biggest Complaint is they were VERY VERY greasy all 3 of them the   quesadilla  the most   wish street tacos had more clintro    and more cheese     yes i will be back  but  if still greasy again  im not sure   Please if you read this mangers  of this Place please  figure out a way to  keep them from being so greasey    again i loved  the food just way to greasy  Thank You"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The food is not as greasy as tacos el Gordo. This is my new taco spot. It's awesome."}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing!! The service is also exceptional. I would come here every night if I could! Highly recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Prices are low, which is surprising for the delicious quality of their food! Such a nice little eating area as well. Highly recommend and it's always great to support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"Is it tasty?!? Is it scrumptious!?! Is it CRUNCHABLE!?!   Score another point for the EASTCYDE Precious!   So Mikey Elite tells me of a new taco joint on EASTCYDE Trop. I'll pho'ks with it. Turns out to be a brand new spot. Three weeks old and kill'n it. We are already looking at the marinated pork on the spit. The young lady immediately gives us a sample of the goods. Probably the most flavorful marinated pork I've had in Vegas and the most greaziest. I wish I had the appetite that day to eat a whole bunch, but I had eaten earlier. My great friend buys me three and they were devoured soon after.   The place has a simple, but clean setup. A lot of Mexican street fare taco joints are popping up in the valley which is great for the taco head in you. Haha Mikey C!!! It's getting hot, so that brick and mortar and AC is looking very accommodating. Combo that with dem tacos and you got a happy customer. I think the only thing missing is that Orange Bang to set dem tacos off.  Great food! Great place! Great customer service!  EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my time in San Diego CA. They have some of the best street tacos. And since I spent time in TJ, (San Diego abbreviation) this place takes me back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Best tacos on the West side! Simple menu but the tacos and tostadas are flavor packed and very filling.  There is good reason why their taco truck is always packed!"}
{"text":"Alright,  so ended up coming here for lunch with my coworkers.   Got 3 carne Asada tacos.  It isn't bad and good prices.  $1.79 per +$.20 to add cheese.    Tortillas were good and meat was good.  Overall it was average. Not amazing and not bad.  The prices will likely bring me back."}
{"text":"The menu is super simple but they do it right. We had the carne asada tacos and a vampiro. The carne is on point. I will definitely come back. I only wish I had the option of choosing flour tortillas for the tacos and that they offered chips"}
{"text":"Both the carne asada and the al pastor meats are very flavorful and moist. The tortillas are moist enough to cup the contents of your taco and don't break apart from being too dry. With such delicious meats, I think they should add \"nachos\" to their menu!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Went to Vegas 2x and had to go here both times. Best carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the state. The price is great. Never been disappointed in the quality of the food. In fact I crave these tacos, want to eat them every day but I restrain myself."}
{"text":"Al pastor! Al pastor! Al pastor! Ohhhhhhh soooooo gooooood. This food truck recently opened in our area. The tacos are mainly composed of meat and guac held by a delicious corn tortilla. In terms of sauces, there is a mild tomato based sauce and a spicy hot sauce. The spicy hot sauce is spicyyyyyy, but the perfect heat to elevate the tacos. I highly recommend adding sauce to those tacos. There is not a ton of toppings in order to highlight the meat. Man oh man, the meat is well marinated! They only offer two types of meat: carne asada and al pastor - both out-of-this-world delicious. The meat is made fresh, char on the outside giving it that nice crunchy texture, and juicy in the inside when you bite into it. I would highly recommend the al pastor if you had to pick & choose. Each taco selling for only $1.50 - ya got a deal! If you're not into tacos, they also have quesadillas & mulitas.   The line moves quickly. It took only 10 minutes between the time we ordered and received our food.  Fast service as they have 5 people busily cooking inside the truck, and 2 people manning the front. The service was excellent! I like how all the workers are wearing the same Tacos Tijuana caps. There is the option to dine outside or take the food togo. We brought our canine buddy, and he was able to chill besides us underneath the canopy while we were downing the tacos. This place made my evening, and I shall be back for more!"}
{"text":"Best taco stand I've ever had! The only not \"good\" thing I can think of is the wait but good food isn't fast, so don't expect to get your food in less than 10-15 mins. this place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but service from front clerk was HORRIBLE. Her name was Nancy, and she was so unprofessional. To start she was on her cell phone the whole time. Being it my first time there, I didn't know you have to hand your receipt copy to the cooks so they can cook your order. Normally you hand or show the receipt after your food is presented. The front clerk Nancy failed to specify, or she might have, but I couldn't tell whether she was talking to me or her Cell. When I was trying to make up my mind, she rolled her eyes and clicked her nails on counter. When I asked the cooks about my food, she came up and yelled at ME as if I knew what to do. I thought I was the paying customer! Then when I asked the cook what her name was, she came to my table and literally threw a business card at me and said \"here's the number if you want to call and complain about me\". I got up, and asked what her problem was, she continued to yell at me. I thought I was on an MTV show \"Punk'd\". I left and called manager, he didn't seem too concerned. Never again will I come back to that place."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The tacos were pretty good. I  also ordered the taquitos (rolled tacos). The taquitos I would stay away from, they seemed to be packaged taquitos."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 4 stars even though my order was short 4 tacos!! Don't worry, I'll ask for them tomorrow when I go back for more!  The hand made tortillas are great and the meat is it so well! I hate thick cut tacos; these guys cut their meat fine enough. Tacos are nicely stuffed and guacamole was on point. First time here but I don't know if they have salsa to go. Besides the 4 missing tacos, I forgot to ask for that. This is my new spot from 6-12a."}
{"text":"Their tacos are so delicious and they have the customer service to match. Such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Holy hell...what is that smell!!!!??  Is it raw sewage??? What is that smell??? It is NOT the food being cooked and it's disgusting.  It hits you like a ton of bricks when you walk in. There is no way that I could eat inside of this restaurant. It makes me question the sanitation of this restaurant.  The owner of this place needs to go to the landlord immediately and demand that they fix this. Crazy. It's a cute little fast food taco shop but you would have to wear clothe pins on your nose to stand inside to order or eat your food."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor, Tripas, Lengua, and Carne Asada tacos are phenomenal!!! Basically anything on their menu is to die for! Great friendly service and they are quick to give you your food! There's a lot of taco places out here but this is one of the very few I actually enjoy enough to the point where I am here writing this Yelp review!"}
{"text":"Simple, affordable, and delicious. Not far from the airport, this taco spot is great when you're on your way in and out of town or just craving some solid tacos that are packed to the brim with meat. Most tacos are less than $2.50 and they're stuffed! They also have a variety of horchata and drinks on the soda fountain."}
{"text":"This is pretty darn close to TJ Tacos as your gonna get outside of Baja or Cali. -Handmade Tortillas  -Grilled Asada or Pastor -Guacamole -Mexican Sodas -Mmmmmmmmm  Its a must try!"}
{"text":"Ok guys. I've been there twice in 2 days. That's how fucking good this place is. We heard about the truck on 67th ave and tbird but never tried it. I happen to find this location while getting the car washed across the street and fell in LOVE! So the menu is similar to in n out burger, super simple. They have carne asada and pork, both equally delicious. Also there are a couple sauces you can bring to your table and the light brown one is OUT OF THIS FUCKING WORLD. It's hella cheap and their horchata is homemade from heaven. So go there, tell your friends and you're fucking welcome. Go NOW!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!! Mulitas y Tacos entodo!! Viva la Mexico!! All ingredients are fresh. I woukd suggest bringing your own drink.  Im not used to drinking out of glass coca cola bottles."}
{"text":"DELISH!!! Great tacos. Carne Asada and Al Pastor are delicious!!! They also serve the grilled onions and peppers. Everything is always fresh and the staff are super friendly. It's a perfect little taco joint. Once word of mouth spreads, this place will be BUSY!!! I prefer it to the popular chain Tacos El Gordo. The meat at Tacos Tijuana is tastier."}
{"text":"They are the best!!!!!!!. Love their tacos. Returned yesterday coming all the way from Lake Havasu city with my in laws to eat their tacos, I promised them that they would not be disappointed. They loved it, thank you and your staff for the hospitality,we felt at home!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here but the service is terrible. The tacos are good but sometimes i dont have time to be ignored."}
{"text":"Tacos. Al. Pastor.   Taco Tijuana is one of the best places to purchase Al Pastor tacos in town (located on Tropicana and Topaz), and for about $2 a taco with a friendly staff making them, we are going to be repeat customers whenever we get a taco craving.  Unlike other places, your tacos will be packed with meat and swimming with flavor (I order mine with everything on it). Personally, I squirt a ton of lime juice on mine because I love the taste. The meat in the tacos have great texture variety with some crisp that makes every bite more addicting.   Refreshment options available for purchase: bottled water, canned soda, and there is a horchata fountain with many flavors available.   Procedure: Pay the cashier, drop your order sheet off on the side, choose your seats, pick your order up, and enjoy your delicious tacos. Tacos also come with a plate of grilled pepper and onions that pair together beautifully!"}
{"text":"Excellent is all that needs to be said ..... Very afordable. Great menu will definitely return next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Whoa. This place is fabulous! Bright atmosphere, upgraded menus and paying system.  I wish they had real juices.. A fountain of the juices is not authentic where as their tacos are! SO good! I recommend the Tacos Al Pastor. Mouthwatering flavorful tacos of the taco gods!"}
{"text":"Just came here a few days ago.  I was expecting a lot better.  I wish the rating score would also do 1/2 points because if it did this review would be a 3.5.  I ordered 2 tacos de adobada (spicy pork), 1 tongue, and 1 tripe.  I ordered my tacos with everything which is cilantro, onion and salsa.  The adobada tacos were good.  I was not a huge fan of the tortillas.  They somewhat have a flavor that regular tacos do not have, not even tacos in Mexico.  The tongue taco was ok.  The tongue was just not too flavorful (probably not seasoned enough with salt).  The tripe taco made me disappointed.  The tortilla to this taco was warm because they had just warmed it up but the tripe was kind of cold :( which was sad because these are my favorite tacos.  The color of the lard was white with clearly shows also that the tripe was cold.  My tacos came with grilled onions and peppers.  These were good. Up to now, the best tacos in Las Vegas are still the ones on Lamb and Bonanza.  Las Taquizas.  I am trying different tacos in Vegas to see if I find any better but so far those are the best.  If I am ever in the area, and really wanted tacos, I would give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night with some friends for dinner. I had never been here before but I have heard great things so I was excited to try it. It's located in the corner near planet fitness. Decent size place with a cute lit up patio. You walk up to the counter, order, and then they will call your number when your food is ready. They have a green and red salsa you can add on the side.   The tacos were AMAZING! They had the option of carne Asada and El Pastor. I got two of each. The meat was so flavorful and the home made pressed corn tortillas were so good. The El Pastor had to of been my favorite!!!   They were street taco style loaded with cilantro, lime, raw white onion, and an avocado creama. They are small, so I ordered 4 tacos and it was the perfect amount for me. They also had a small cooler with Mexican sodas. Love me some glass bottle Coca Cola! Mmmmmm   Overall everything was so delicious. Looking forward to coming back, maybe for taco tuesday."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give 5 stars to a taqueria on my first visit? HELLZ YEAH!!!! We drove pass this place on our way to Taco Taco. After our A-OK visit, we back tracked and decided to give Taco Tijuana a go. Immediately as we step inside, The HOSTESS starts explaining the menu items to us...Cool!?  We step up to peruse the menu board, and the other two cooks start offering suggestions!? I'm thinking WOW, what service!? Any time I see an Al pastor/Adobada Carousel, that immediately becomes one taco choice, Don't forget to request it with pineapple! Another favorite of mine is crispity, crunchity tripas, so I request it extra crispy, along with a lengua. Wifey was quite stuffed from our previous stop, so she just got a cheese quesadilla.  The best way I can describe this set up is a condensed set up of El Gordo. They don't have a salsa bar, just limes and radishes but I'm sure they can hook you up with salsa upon request. The grilled chiles and scallions are complimentary which goes well with the tacos, and they're pretty generous with the meats here. The Lengua was topped with a salsa verde which was very soft, tender, and tasty. The Adobada was very flavorful and is way better than Gordo's IMO....The Tripa was served with salsa rojo and so perfectly crispy, that gave me the \"Exorcist Effect\" (You know, where Linda Blair's eyes roll to the back of her head?) that's how great that first bite was, and I was happy to find my new favorite taco de tripa in town! Stellar service until the end-they delivered our order to us, got more napkins for us check on us  periodically and even emptied our trays for us...absolutely some of the best service ever.Cannot wait to return!..... GET  THE TRIPA TACO EXTRA CRISPY....YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!ALOHA!!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(97/100) \"New Taco Sheriff In Town\""}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(304/365) \"Taco Tijuana 2.0\"  If you're a fan of Taco Tijuana, There's another location inside the Broadacres Swap Meet & Events Center up North!  A little smaller than their Tropicana location with outdoor dining accommodations, service is quick and  easy, menu items and prices are the same, and the tacos are pretty good. I got an Al Pastor and a Tripa Taco. I Like my tripa(Beef Intestine, NOT tripe!) extra crispy and luckily there were some crispy ones available!  The tacos were good, but for the Al Pastor one, I wish that they would cook the pineapple with the meat, instead of hacking a piece off and placing it on the taco. Nevertheless, they were both solid.. This is one of the many dining options you have while checking out Broadacres with the family!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"( I think I'm the last customer)  The tacos al pastor are loaded, I think they need a tad bit more seasoning,  tripas between soft and crunchy .... too bad they close at 1am"}
{"text":"I love this place some of the best tacos ever. Definitely recommend to everyone. Authentic and a very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nuestra primera vez aquí. ordenamos tacos de asada, por cierto estaban al 2x1. Sorry pero la carne no tenía nada de sabor, a los tacos le tuvimos que poner mucho limón y tampoco así supieron buenos :/"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos I was so surprised to find authentic Mexican tacos on this side of town. The asada and pastor are fire must try."}
{"text":"Bomb ass food!!! I have been looking for authentic Mexican food for a while and this place hits home. They have tacos, quesadillas, and vampiros. They take cards which is very convenient. This place is a small food truck on the bicycle shop lot."}
{"text":"SO glad we found this place finally! We looked for them one night and gave up. Today, we weren't looking and found them, right on the NW corner of 67 and Thunderbird in the Golden Spoke parking lot.  AMAZING flavor in all the ingredients. The homemade corn tortillas melt in your mouth along with the steak from the carne asada. The salsas are wonderful. The hot is actually hot and the mild is very fresh and flavorful. And, despite this being a food truck, the young men that work out front are extremely helpful in keeping the tacos coming when you want to order more (which you will!) and keeping the area clean."}
{"text":"Como se dice \"awesome\"?  Not fancy, but fabulous.  The sauce in the red bottle will kill most any gringo - I was fortunate to walk away with only a flesh wound.  The clear bottle sauce will light up a Caucasian tongue, but a native won't even blink.  The menu is brief, but the food excellent.  Bring a lot of napkins to your table and be prepared for the real deal!!"}
{"text":"What makes this place so great is definitely their fresh in house made tortillas! The idea of this taco truck is so simple but yet it has so much to offer! The menu is right to the point and pretty much serve what they are known for: there tacos. They are absolutely flavorful and the price is great!!   I had 3 carne asada tacos and they come with fresh guacamole, cilantro, tomato sauce, & onions also served with a lime wedge! You can tell how fresh these tacos are and the family running this truck really takes the time to work together efficiently to get your order in and out to you quickly!   They have seats & tables right outside their truck which makes it so much easier for some people to enjoy their tacos!   I definitely will be coming back especially to try their Al Pastor tacos!"}
{"text":"The best street tacos my family has found so far, good service, good hours of operation, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Okay honesty best taco place around. If you're there get al pastor mulas or carve asada fries, and they also make their tortillas by hand yummy!!"}
{"text":"awesome tacos with great service super authentic I'll drive miles for these tacos. Their Mulas are so freaking good it's the closest thing to having Mulas right in Tijuana"}
{"text":"Great tacos great service , definitely best in Peoria . Todos de adobada are a must here and with the chews !!! Hell yeah"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for tacos! Freshly made corn tortillas. They have great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"You know this place is good when it's 110 out and it's still packed.  I drove by this place a few times before I stopped. I'm glad that I did. Every single time I've gone it's been great"}
{"text":"Amazing flavor! Tortillas seem to be made fresh. They aren't your ordinary corn tortillas. Really good. Adds another great flavor to their tacos."}
{"text":"Really love going to this place, wish there was one by my house but at least it's near UNLV. The food is really good, better than Roberto's in my opinion."}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos on the west side of town. Most definitely will be making this a regular place to get my tacos."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. There's quality food for low prices. I definitely recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the food was delicious.  I had 3 tacos and they had freshly pressed tortillas, perfectly cooked meats (and plenty of it), fantastic flavors.  There wasn't a huge array of sauces like at other Taco joints but hey when it tastes that good....   I'll be back"}
{"text":"Q: What do you do when you see a long line of people every 100 degree + evening waiting to pick up tacos al pastor and carne asada tacos all summer long?  A: Get in line behind them and check out the delicious food from this local family business gem."}
{"text":"I love everything here! Food is delicious for a good price. The only thing I'm disappointed with is that you only get to choose between carne asada and el pastor."}
{"text":"I've been eating these tacos at their location at the swap meet for years and it's soooo good! I've been waiting for them to open up another location! So happy they did! Al pastor is better than TEG ( if you know tacos, you know what I'm referencing) everything I've had is bomb"}
{"text":"Had probably the best tacos El Pastor tonight! I've been excited to visit the new store front after many great experiences from their taco stand up the road.  Tonight was nothing less than exceptional as usual!!"}
{"text":"Eating here did not absolutely destroy my digestive system, which is not something I can say often about eating out. 20% off Tacos on Tuesdays.  The only complaint I have is their lack of ice for free water, but it is free so I really shouldn't be complaining about that."}
{"text":"Not from the area and driving around-I saw this on yelp. The services was very nice and people very friendly. Oh and the tacos are amazing. So good I'm going back for round 2!"}
{"text":"I went here with my dad on our way through Vegas. Soon after we walked in we were greeted by the manager (?) and he walked us through the simple menu in Spanish.  We went with Aldobadas and Lengua. Both were very good, but my favorite was the Aldobadas with the pineapple slice.  The place looks too have opened recently. It's small inside, simply decorated with bright colors.  The food kitchen is open so you could watch everything being made.  Taco prices were mostly 2$ ea. The meat seemed good quality. They are on the small side so expect to order 2 or more."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. But I only gave it 4 stars because of the service.  The lady helping me at this location at (3:45 pm 6/27/18 )got my order wrong twice because she wasn't paying attention, and was not helpful when I asked about the salsas and other questions I had. She wears glasses and didn't catch her name since nobody wears name tags here .  She had a very laid back attitude (not in a good way). Didn't want to order more food just because of the service. Will probably come back but after the night crew comes in. Much more professional and efficient."}
{"text":"The tortilla is definitely what makes the tacos. Maybe I should've ordered the items on their menu that aren't common. They forgot guacamole on one taco and were nice and put it on. They weren't the best I've ever had, but they weren't awful. The price is great though at 1.99 a taco for the tacos I had. I will have to come back and try again."}
{"text":"OMG! Best place to get tacos. Be sure to go on Tuesday for taco Tuesday for 20% off. I go at least once a week sometimes more. The employees are nice as well. There is an area to dine outside as well. Be sure to stop here and get your tacos."}
{"text":"This place has yummy tacos! Pretty close to the real Tijuana street tacos. Reasonable price for the size of the tacos which is not small at all...and lots of guacamole!"}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had. Hands down the best. The service there is very friendly. I've had a lot of other tacos around AZ and this one here is close to my house and it's awesome! Idk what else to say because the yelp won't let me post this unless the review is long enough to their requirements. Okay. It's long enough now. Bomb tacos. Bomb hot sauce. Food is amazing! Eat there. And bring me tacos too. HMU fam. #TacosTijuanaForLife"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this taco place...    DELICIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.   Their service is pleasant, quick and friendly. Their pork & carne is the best I've tasted in a long time.   I find myself here practically every week"}
{"text":"The staff here are super chipper and the food is pretty good, better than a lot of other taco shops I've been to. They don't give you a hard time about the hot sauce and their meat proportions were very generous. All and all not bad!"}
{"text":"Me and my son had mulitas with chorizo. There wore amazing, tacos de pastor, I can't even explain how good they are,my son was very happy ,and satisfy, I recommend for you to give it a try"}
{"text":"Garbage. Whatever they put on the carne asada is interesting. The service sucks. The tortilla was doughy. That was the first visit. This place is always so busy, we couldn't figure out what the hype was about so tried to give them another try.  Service. What service? The lights turned off as we got out of the vehicle. It was 8:21.. Cool time to close and if you were going to close, maybe turn your lights off when you see the vehicles approaching.  Save your money and taste buds and drive down to 91st and Peoria at Waldo's."}
{"text":"Best street tacos out there! Super clean! The al pastor tacos I got were amazing. It has such a unique taste I can eat these every day! The staff is also very amazing very inviting and are so patient to let you know exactly what to expect from the menu. They don't have much variety on the menu but honestly I don't think they need to add or change anything on menu."}
{"text":"Great spot for great tacos. First time here won't be the last time. Only two options to choose from as far as meat goes however that may be a little better because there's less opportunity to mess it up. Guarantee if you come here you will not be unhappy. Great prices great atmosphere."}
{"text":"As a Southern California Mexican, my expectations on Mexican fast food are through the roof. This place didn't just meet my expectations, it exceeded them.   I'll start with the service. The man in charge, I wish I had his name, was so kind and showed a real passion for his business. He didn't just sit there annoyed at my European friends being unaware of what half the menu meant. He explained every choice enthusiastically, and offered up suggestions that they'd be sure to love.   The food was top notch. I was shocked, really. The carne asada muleta exploded with flavor. The beef was incredibly juicy. The al pastor was nuts, slow roasting, and cut right off the bone similar to brazilian style birria. All this for very reasonable prices.   I'd go back again anytime I find myself near the area. If you live nearby, GO!"}
{"text":"Walked in and the staff was so happy they get along and make each other laugh.  Easy taking the order. Very nice easy going  Food was great everything looked fresh   Asada tacos come in hand made tortillas yum are super delicious.    We also had pastor yummy too. I had my tacos to go and before I asked the guy packed me grilled onions and some jalapeños. (How did he know) lol   Everyone was just amazing and nice very welcoming. Keep up the great work everyone you guys were awesome   I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"So my brother in law told me about this place. All I have to say that the tacos were so DELICIOUS! The hand made tortillas are the key to the flavor(well everything is lol). I will definitely  be coming back! I had order 3 tacos de asada but I had to order 2 more (there small ) that's how good they were!"}
{"text":"The taco adobada was amazing. The taco asada was not: fatty chewy meat and watered down tasting guac. I only tried the 2 cause I didn't know what the others were and they weren't able to explain them to me. I will definitely go back for the adobada. I wouldn't try to eat them on the go as they are very messy."}
{"text":"Great tacos. I love both the carne Asada and the pork. Fresh tortilla.  The only thing I would add would be a medium red sauce. The red sauce he great but it is fire. The green is mild. Or the could add a salsa bar.  I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Good meat, Great corn tortillas. Overall I would come back, one of the Better taco joints on the west side. Price is Extremely fair!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Arizona from Illinois I've been looking for a really good taco place and I came across this spot in my search to find something to eat that was close by. I was a little disappointed at first when I found out that the menu had very little options so I ordered two steak and two pork tacos and I have to say they were perfect the meat was so juicy and packed full of flavor, it pared perfectly with the guacamole, cilantro, lime, and hot sauce. The hot sauce was probably one of the hottest things I have ever eaten I could only put like 2 little drops on my tacos and I still wanted to drink a tall glass of milk afterwards. The price of the tacos is $1.75 which is unbeatable, especially given the quality of the food which was really good. All in all this place is a must try for taco lovers"}
{"text":"I stopped here because another reviewer mentioned the tacos were \"authentic.\" I'm from Austin and have traveled down to and eaten in Mexico, and I've never had such a greasy mess of a taco. Mexican food doesn't need to give you a heart attack to be good. The polite, fast service and very clean tables redeem it one star, but I'd certainly look elsewhere for authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Im very picky with when it comes to food, but this place was so good. They only have 2 type of meat but they are both really good. The tortillas are amazing, I could eat them all day. The horchata is good as well, is not overly sweet like most places. The green sauce is spicy and I personally didn't like the red sauce, it had no flavor"}
{"text":"I feel like there was a disgruntled employee over at Tacos El Gordo who decided to leave and start his/her own taco shop modeled exactly after Tacos El Gordo. That new taco shop is what we now know as Taco Tijuana. If you've been to Tacos El Gordo, I SWURR that everything tastes the same... which is actually a great thing! Everything is the same great quality, and now I don't have to drive out of my way to get some bomb tacos.  What does differentiate them from TEG is the fact that they will put their meat into any form of \"Mexican Food\"--burritos, quesadillas, etc., something that does not happen at TEG.  $2 a taco may seem expensive for street tacos, but they pile the meat on there. You won't be disappointed! They have a patio and have recently added on another room. More tacos for everyone! Wooooooo!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! A new find by fellow taquiera connoissuer Nelson Q!   The restaurant is clean and all the workers were friendly and helpful. The setup is pretty simple. A small counter place orders, a smaller seperate area for orders of al pastor tacos, and the cashier. A soda fountain and condiment bar are located near the entrance and a small seating area is in the back. When you order the counter person will ask how you want your tacos dressed, grilled onions and peppers are also ordered from the counter.  On my visit, I tried the al pastor, lengua, cabeza, and tripas. The al pastor was a little disappointing, even though I asked for everything on it, I could not find any pineapple. The lengua and cabeza were both very tender, but the best of the bunch would have to be the tripas! It kind of surprised me to find this out. The tripas is washed very well, so there is no earthy, grassy flavor to it and there is a light smokiness to it. Also, the tripas was not chewy at all.   So between the extremely friendly and helpful service and the excellent tripas tacos, this place easily gets 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Review based on Uber Eats.  The Uber driver was right on and came to the hotel valet to drop it off. This place really needs to revamp their Uber eat packaging especially since this is what could have made this a 4 Star review.  I ordered a plate of al pastor with tortillas and a mulita (two tortillas with cheese and stuffed with meat) I specified corn, got flour. I asked for carne asada and got al pastor. Al doable but why on earth would you wrap it with one piece of foil !? Meat juice dripping all over the bag, all over the foil everywhere! No salsas, no utensils, a few limes but plenty of radishes. Flavor was okay but the having to clean up the drippy mess made everything cold. Get it together and I might be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Good service, clean, yummy food. I tried sudadero for the first time when they told me they didn't have carnitas, really good. The tacos are the best on the menu but the sopes are good too. Skip carne asada fries or burritos, the tacos are the best. Mulas are good too.all the meat tastes good but the buche is amazingly good here."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Arizona! My favorite is the tacos pastor. Staff is attentive and friendly. Very clean and inviting. Taco lovers must visit!"}
{"text":"Located conveniently on the parking lot on the corner of 67th Ave and Thunderbird, this Mexican lonchera has been our latest destination for delicious tacos and outdoor dining. The truck is known for handmade tortilla, and offers a large tent with plenty of seating for people to dine-in on the spot. The limited menu features al pastor and carne asada served in Tacos, Quesadillas, or Mulitas. Each comes with cabbage, onion, mild sauce, and guacamole. On every table there are two types of salsa of varying degrees of intensity to match the blazing sun in the Arizona backdrop.  We managed to try both the Al Pastor and Carne Asada Tacos ($1.50). They make the al pastor with a pineapple on the spit. The hand carved pork was tender, well seasoned, with a nice balance of lean and fatty flavors. Similarly, the Carne Asada Taco had good seasoning, as the beef was lean, tender, and not overly chewy. The guacamole added finesse to the tacos, and the touches of cabbage, onion, and mild sauce were enough to complicate the flavors. The single deck golden corn tortilla came with wow factor underscored by its thick and fluffy qualities and good corn flavor. The sizable tortilla effectively held onto everything until the last bite.  The Carne Asada Mulitas ($2.99) was my favorite item on the menu. It arrived with well-seasoned carne asada, cheese, guacamole, and the whole works stacked in-between two handmade corn tortillas. I loved the melted cheese to accompany the beefy flavors and sweet creamy guacamole.   The item that I do not recommend is the Al Pastor Quesadilla ($5.99). The flavor of the Monterey Jack dominated, so I couldn't taste the seasoning on the Al Pastor and the supporting ingredients. The grilled flour tortilla had a wonderful mix of crisp, flaky, and soft textures, but the profile was missing a sharp ingredient to give some pop to the flavors. Other than these subtleties the value did not translate well. I can get a bigger and better quesadilla for less the price elsewhere.  Initially, I was hoping for these tacos to come with double deck tortillas. But given how thick they were, the striking corn flavor would have overshadowed the key elements that made these tacos great. On the down side, I thought each item could include more meat. I also find cilantro and jalapeno to be missing ingredients that could contribute to the overall experience. The idea of a tip jar on every table seemed a bit much, if not impeding the classic working-class lonchera sensibility.   Despite these shortcomings, I find service to be upbeat, friendly, and gracious. The staff worked with a level of enthusiasm that was unmatched, and the quality of their food reflected how much they cared. The ordering process was swift, knowledgeable, with a sense of order, and they did a great job at keeping the area clean. Additionally, they were very kind to bring us some grilled onions and pepper on the side, as well as a warm tortilla for Santi to sample. It was overall a positive experience. I look forward to returning for these delicious tacos and mulitas."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing. They make the tortillas there. They have cold beverages. I was very impressed with everything! It's a wonderful atmosphere and great service. The staff is very friendly. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop here and grab some carne asada tacos.  I bought 3 and they were delicious!  So I went back and bought 3 more and a vampiro for the he'll of it and it was all great.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and tried many places, feeling having good tacos, this place is a Gem in this town, flavor, original, service, loved this place, if you come to Vegas this is the place for the best tacos."}
{"text":"Bookmarked them a few months ago. I was nearby, & wanted something quick so that determined me stopping here. The place honestly looks abandoned. I drove around the building twice to confirm it was still in business. So we parked and went in & there were other patrons inside so that was a sigh of relief. I reviewed the menu & decided on \"safe\" tacos again. 3 steak tacos, w/cilantro,salsa, & onions. Ordering was quick. Employees were ok.   Tacos were MEH... They seem to be a knock off Taco El Gordo & not meeting the mark completely. They skimped on the meat. The tacos were cold. Or maybe it was cold condiments which made my tacos cold, either way I didn't care for them. I think on a drunk night they'd suffice, but I definitely wouldn't recommend them or go out of my way for them. Been there done that type of thing. Bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS EVER! So fresh and authentic. I'm so glad I found them. My boyfriend compares these to Tacos El Gordo in San Diego (very popular restaurant). The 5 stars are for the food, the only con I can think of is the parking and seating area. It's a food truck that parks outside of a store in the parking lot. Seating is under a tent and there is no bathroom. I don't mind right now as the weather is super nice, but I don't think I'll visit in the summer unless I'm waiting in the car while someone else picks it up. Also, the parking situation is a bit unruly. There are no lines (except for the ones for the store, which are few) in a majority of the lot, so people park like maniacs. Last time I was there I got blocked in, we told the cashier, and when he told someone to move it they took their sweet time. We never even saw them, another guy moved a different car and we just inched until we could squeeze through. I'm hoping that they will eventually find a permanent home in a store front. Again, the food is unbelievably amazing."}
{"text":"James I. said it best.. i am a taco whore!  I am so easy if you want to get into my boxer  -briefs all you have to do is say that magic word..  You have demerits and tacos??  Good, i'll have some tacos then!  I'll drop that shit so fast knowing it will burn right through me like habanero horchata i don't even.  I'll hover, i don't care.  Its going down.  Have f'n mercy..  We came here to check out this new spot, but i really think James l. wanted to show me his new toy he just got.  Who goes to a taco spot and order only 2 tacos?? Seriously??   Before we ordered we were given samples of the al pastor and automatically these pork had tremendous amount of flavor.  A bit oily, but the spices definitely took reign of the taste bud.  Same setup as their competitors with the ordering.  So if you're new to this you pretty much have to stand in line or in front of the station you want to order from.  I took down a lot of tacos in my life, and i would have to say this is the best al pastor i've encounter.  Super satisfy with my tacos and mulas even without the forgotten pineapples.  Like the other reviewers mention they don't skimp on meat.  My meal almost put a fight.. almost.  And James l. had no problem at all knocking down his third.   I'm still on the hunt for the best hot sauce though.  The red and green sauce here is just about the same o same o.  I think seating could be an issue in the near future.. There were only like 8 booth along 3 patio tables outside. Half of the place was the kitchen while the restroom took a chunk of the seating area.  In another word come here off peak hours"}
{"text":"This is another of those places I finally got around to trying after living in Las Vegas for awhile. I passed it often as it's right on E Tropicana close to S Eastern Ave. It's just a few blocks from the Supercenter Walmart that I would shop at often.   =Food= I only came here once as I wasn't all that thrilled with what I had gotten. Not sure if it's just me or the food was off that day. I had gotten a small order of Carna Asada fries and my guest got the Quesadilla with Carna Asada meat. The meat was drier than I'm used to and didn't have much flavor. Fries were crispy, but no salt was added to them. Also, the guacamole didn't taste fresh. This cost me around $7 and it was more than enough for me and my guest to share.  My guest's quesadilla was stuffed full with the Asada meat but didn't have much cheese in it. They weren't thrilled with their food either as it was filled with too much meat and the meat was dry and had no flavor to it. Cost $6.  Another disappointing thing about this place was that they didn't have a salsa bar. I always get extra for my food. If I had been able to have some salsa, it might have been able to add more flavor to my food and made it not seem so plain.   =Customer Service= The people that work here are very friendly. Although they don't speak very clear English, they try their best to communicate with their customers to make sure their orders are correct. Also, the person at the register is also very nice and had a smile on her face when I paid for my food.   =Ending Thoughts= My only complaint here really is the food quality that I got and that they didn't have a salsa bar. Next time if I come again, I'll try the tacos. Many people seem to have good things to say about them."}
{"text":"Very delicious, great service, tacos were well loaded. 5xs better than tacos el gordo. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This spot is one of my Top 5 spots! Pricey but good tasting food that's quality doesn't have a price tag in my book!   This is the way I've eaten tacos in Tijuana BC. Tacos are I bit small so load up on them!!!!  After reading Debbie Downers review (Fred)  I had to respond to it. What does the fact that you've eaten tacos in Miami, NY and LA have to do with Tacos TJ? Different cultures use different ingredients or have different family recipes. That's like saying NY pizza and Chicago pizza are better than pizza from Italy.   Secondly, none of the salsas are hot at all. I'm starting to think you came to this place looking for a reason to put it down.   Please stop posting like you're Guy Fieri of Tacos. If think this place sucks then you're standards for good food aren't all that."}
{"text":"Es un lugar decente no tiene mucho espacio pero la comida es deliciosa, el estacionamiento también es muy pequeño creo que necesitan mudarse a un lugar más grande ya que las personas les dejan saber que es un lugar que les gusta yo en lo particular no iría un fin de semana ya que si entre semana se dificulta el estacionamiento y el servicio puedo imaginar el fin de semana, y sinceramente por muy buenos que estén los tacos para mi no vale la pena la espera y la incomodidad de el lugar."}
{"text":"Omg can I get an amen for these tacos! And their available on Uber eats!!! Tacos heaven here! Worth the try and the extra for delivery :). Try the pork quesadilla it's to die for"}
{"text":"I used to run a Mexican restaurant so although I'm not Mexican, I know my Mexican food. And, this place was great. It was authentic, all handmade in house, with friendly service and great prices. There seems to be a lot of Mexican joints on this stretch of Tropicana, and this one was the busiest as far as we can tell - a very good sign.  We've been in twice and both times were great experiences. We haven't tried everything so we'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos. The tortillas are the best. They're a little on the small side so order a few if you're trying to get full."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and great customer service! For a side-of-the-road taco truck, this place is different.  They have a very efficient and effective order delivery system.  Place your order at the podium, sit down and your food will come quick and hot!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and awesome sauces! The new location is large and clean. I love how their menu is simple. Definitely helps an indecisive person like me choose!"}
{"text":"They had me at home made tortillas.. feels like I am back in San Diego but BETTER! So happy they opened a second location, closer to home. Tacos Tijuana are honestly the best in the west valley!!   Service great Food great  Cleanness"}
{"text":"After passing by and passing over this place dozens of times, I finally was drawn here by a special event. Thank goodness.  Located at Tropicana and Topaz, Taco Tijuana is almost in the shadow of Taco y Taco. Arby's is the only other notable business in the plaza, which is accessible from westbound Tropicana or Topaz. I was surprised that they were already doing brisk business when I stepped in not long after 11am.  The ordering system is more practical than TyT and Tacos El Gordo. You pay for your tacos (or burritos, vampiros, etc.) at the register in the corner and take your slip to the cooks, where you can express your preferences (no jalapeño for me) and ask for semi-grilled onions (some raw parts still) and roasted peppers. Sliced radishes and limes, but no salsa bar, are on the side near the beverage dispensers. Prices are still $2 for most tacos (cheaper than TyT) and $2.25 for lengua, but for their \"Taco Madness\" event, they were just $1 (except for lengua, and they happened to be out of sesos).  I wanted to eat everything, so I tried the lengua anyway. It was a little spicier than everything else, but it was delicious. Suadero was up next, and while the tomato salsa was nice, the beef was a little too tough for my taste. Stick to Tacos El Gordo for suadero. I had to taste the al pastor (aka adobada) at that point, and while I forgot to ask about getting pineapple, it was still delicious with some crispy bites and balanced saltiness. I actually went back and tried it with pineapple, and it didn't change my opinion about it too much.  I finally arrived at the tripas, ordered extra crispy a la Nelson. Great crunch, a little chewy intestinal flavor in the middle. Next, the asada was delicious, with just one tortilla (that's apparently a normal thing for this specific meat), guacamole and a great char from the grill. Buche was in the same tomato salsa as the suadero, and while it wasn't too chewy, the flavor wasn't especially distinctive. Cabeza was last, and it was as delicious as any that I've had even though it didn't have the fatty bits that I'd hoped for. It has the same spicier green salsa as the lengua, but my taste buds were a little numb by this point.  Not only was the ordering system easy and the food delicious, but the employees were really nice. The cashier offered to bring my food to my table, and one of the cooks wrapped my leftovers in foil and even threw in more onions. I could see myself eating everything again except the suadero, and I'll probably return here for my next taco fix."}
{"text":"These tacos are one of the best I've had , BETTER than Charlie's!!!! They tortillas are fresh and made from scratch. The meat is tender and the sauce is hot but not to hot to wear you can't enjoy it! The atmosphere is welcoming! I will definitely be coming back and telling everyone I know about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos are really good! Not too many \"taco\" options on that side of town but I'm glad they chose this location!"}
{"text":"Went there for National Taco Day this past Tuesday. Really enjoyed what I got:  adobado and tripitas. The adobado was flavorful and the tripitas had a good texture. The tacos are a good size, and inexpensive for what you get."}
{"text":"So this all started wondering why the Hell was there so many cars at the bike shop.  When we realized that there was a taco trailer there we had no choice but to stop.   I am so glad we did!  The food was outstanding and the salsa was even better.  However all that said, it was the handmade corn tortillas that were the topper.  Great meal great service.  Another foodie bucket list item!!!!"}
{"text":"Good but really nothing special. I will go back. 6 bucks for 3 tacos is a good deal in my books. I got two asada tacos and 1 pastor. For the 1st time ever I think I liked the pastor more. The asada with everything on it might have had to much on it. Overall both flavors were good but nothing really stood out on this day. I will go again and update if it needs it."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite , after seeing so many great reviews , I was having dinner a little later that evening , so it was just a quick snack to keep me tide over , I walked in and was greeted promptly by the cashier and kitchen staff , I ordered a quesidilla with adobada , and omg !! The meat was a perfect balance of crispy pieces and juicy tender perfectly marinaded chunks of pork bliss !! The quesidilla was made with slices of Mexican cheese and topped with a wonderful salsa that wasn't too spicy or weak ! It was also served with big chunks of grilled onions and a roasted chile !! Flavor wise it needed nothing !! The entire staff was very friendly , which goes a long way , not like taco y taco or la famosa Jose , both which are down the street & which I love their food but their service is spotty at best . There is a small salsa bar area , which looks like it has cut limes and marinated carrots / onions but no salsas that I seen ,but as I said it needed none !! I would frequent this place more if they had carnitas , which I didn't see on menu ?? But maybe they do have ?? The menu is mostly tacos , with many meat varieties , they do have burritos , nachos as well , but that is pretty much it I'm sure their tacos are the stars which I definetly will go back and try !!"}
{"text":"Wish I could have given 6 stars. Great tacos. Had the carne asada, kids had the pork. Everyone loved the food. Friendly staff, great price. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"White Boy approved tasty Mexican treat!   5 Caliente Peppers!   The Al Pastor tacos are oh so delicious. This street taco restaurant is friendly, fun and clean.     Drove through from the Hoover Dam trying to avoid traffic. Worth including in your plans."}
{"text":"Ordered from ubereats and took about 15 mins to get here, don't let the sound of that discourage you i live kinda far.  My point is 15 mins later i get my food delivered and they were still some of the best tacos I've had in north Phoenix !"}
{"text":"Authentic!  The portions are small but amazing!  Great for the price.  This was our first visit and we will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Tacos de Asada con todo are awesome and only $2. Which is cheaper than Los Tacos, Pepes and Tacos El Gordo.  They also give you cooked onion and chile's on the side. Tacos al pastor are really good too. I really wish this place was closer to my house or my job I would definitely be there at least once or twice a week. The staff is super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this little truck by mistake.  We decided to stop by and I am so glad we did.  The tortillas ate home made.  AL Pastor is very good.  Very Clean and very friendly people."}
{"text":"I've been driving past here for weeks and finally stopped by. I'm glad I did. They have a very limited menu and that is why they are so good. I had the Mulitas, two fresh corn tortillas filled with Al pastor, guac, cilantro, onion cheese. Wow! Also so inexpensive. For less then a boring burger you get good street food!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I was confused about how to order. The menu is in Spanish and if you don't know what cabeza, lengua etc. means then Google it. I had taken Spanish in college but I couldn't remember what was what. I had someone with me who saw this place and said it had great reviews so why not try it so that's why we were there.   I ordered the al pastor taco. I had just tried the al pastor at some other place but I felt this one was a little better . If I can remember it was $2 a taco? Overall, this place is a hole in the wall. There were flies flying around inside and it was kind of empty for being the lunch rush. It was good but not memorable enough for me to always want it.   They do take credit card but I think there's a $5 minimum. It's warm in there so dress appropriately."}
{"text":"These tacos are delicious. You can see the staff making fresh corn tortillas through the window. Great flavor, I just wish they offered them with cheese."}
{"text":"I'm really bummed I loved this place and came here a least once a week but the service has gotten so bad I won't be coming back. I stood in line for 15min while the guy taking the orders counted his tip jar. The time before that waited 45min just.to get the wrong order and have to wait another 20min. Bummer"}
{"text":"If you're looking for street tacos, this is the place, nothing fancy! The food is good the service it's good and clean tables."}
{"text":"Delicious! Inexpensive! First time coming and it was a great experience. Glad we have it in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"No pos wow que puedo decir de este lugar?  Lástima que sólo tengan asada y al pastor !!  En el futuro porfaz traigan tripita y pollo asado seria genial!!  Les falta una salsa bar!!! Pepinos , rábanos cual lo menos!!!  Y pues la salsas pueden ser mejores en tomatillos usando serranos o chiles de árbol!  Mis tacos favoritos son los del al pastor !!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos fresh and tasty! Service was good and located on a corner lot also cozy especially now when the weather is great. One off the best street tacos I ate in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times thanks to my good friend and I have not been disappointed. I have been to Tijuana and tried tacos there and I have to say this place is just like if you were in Tijuana. The hand made tortilla are awesome and the flavor of the asada and pastor are just on point. I recommend this place with out a doubt. Just cuz I leave far from this place if not I would be here everyday."}
{"text":"I've only tried there Carne Asada tacos and vampiros. The tacos are pretty well done with onion, cilantro, guacamole and your choice of salsa.  Sometimes the cooks are slow but the waiters are very generous."}
{"text":"Tijuana is a no-nonsense parking lot food stand that offers up some tacos that are not only cheap, but actually taste pretty good!  We ordered a total of four, including two asada and two pastor. Both tacos packed great quality for the price you pay, with their homemade corn tortillas providing very little sogginess that often plague some of these no-frills taco joints. The quesadilla (cheese-only) was priced at $2.99, while tacos were $1.75 a piece. And this was on a Friday night with no specials going on. I definitely can't complain about price.  Comparing them to the tacos I've tasted at more upscale sit-down restaurants would be an unfair judgment. Yes, there are better tacos out there, but definitely not in the immediate area. In terms of convenience and price, I think that Tijuana does a pretty damned good job of delivering!  For my girlfriend and I, I see them as a great option for those evenings where we feel like eating quick and cheap.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Tacos Tijuana truck over on 67th and Thunderbird, so I was glad to see that they're finally able to open up an actual sit-down restaurant that's slightly closer to my house.  After eating here several times, I'm pleased that the tacos are basically the equivalent of those served from the truck. You only have two choices in either pastor or carne asada. Simplicity is fine by me, although you can also opt for mulitas or vampiros if you wish. Tacos are 1.75 each, or a flat two dollars if you want to add cheese.  For cheap tacos, what they offer here is excellent. The homemade corn tortillas work well. I have no gripes about either the asada or pastor, but think the pastor packs a bit more flavor depth overall. Get it in quesadilla form and you really don't need to order anything else. The only flaw I can find is that the tacos often vary between heavily packed to skimpy depending on who is making them.  Yes, there are better tacos out there if you know where to look, but given their price range, I consider these people to be one of the more superior options when it comes to cheap eating.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ive been cruising by this food truck for a while now. Finally stopped in to check them out. I had a couple carne asada tacos and one al pastor. Both were delicious. I even watched the corn tortillas being made. Extra fresh. About $5 out the door.  Check this guy out."}
{"text":"The adobada tacos were pretty good but didn't care too much for the asada ones. It's a pretty chill environment.  I just wished they had authentic horchata and not from the machine"}
{"text":"Meat was tough. Look elsewhere for succulent cuts. I've had many street tacos before and some have been quite tender and buttery soft. This place used low-grade meats.  Spend your money elsewhere. Plus, the men's bathroom had no soap and had water all over the ground: not good!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos and quesedillas. 3 beef and 3 pork tacos will fill you up for sure. Place is clean and friendly. They even let you do half pork and beef quesadilla."}
{"text":"Awesome taco truck spot in glendale.. Tasty tacos, cool lil setting and eating area. I'd eat here again for sure. I wish they had burritos."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Customer service is impeccable, the tacos are delicious. So happy for this hard working family! They are always busy, but never fail to deliver fast and yummy tacos. #livefortacos #tacotuesdaysrule"}
{"text":"Al pastor and carne asada is amazing and at 2 dollars per taco you can't beat it. We use to like to go to taco y taco but not anymore. The value, ease of ordering and friendly staff make the our taco experience all that better. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not the first time we've been here and certainly not the last. Went with the steak and pork to see the best of both worlds! The pork is a little sweet so it was bomb bomb. If I wasn't trying to lose weight I would eat here every day, EVERYDAY!!!!   The employees are super kind and polite. There was a rude customer here that was yelling at them and they still handled things professionally. Seeing that made me respect this business even more."}
{"text":"Perfect street tacos. Al Pastor with guacamole sauce is so good. The price of $1.75 is good value. You can phone in an order ahead of time otherwise be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"They just took to long to get tacos the place it's not even packed and they took almost 30 minutes for my order ."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic tacos! We tried a bunch of their tacos and a burrito to split. Everything was amazing! The girl working the counter was great too, super helpful and such a sweetheart! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The most important thing in a great taco is the tortilla and they got the down. Some of the best tacos in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. No one greets customers when they enter the restaurant. The employees just stare at you as if you're in the wrong place. I mentioned it to the guy who appeared to be the supervisor or manager, he didn't really have much to say in response. Either he was caught off-guard or it wasn't an issue for him."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, I decided this place over another local Mexican restaurant. I ordered 4 tacos, 2 carne Asada and 2 pork. The meat was hard and felt like I was eating bone fragments on my first bite! I had to spit them out. I tried one of each and lost my appetite. Extremely disappointing after reading all the rave about it. There's too many other places like Manuel's or Macayos that are guaranteed to hit the spot. Unfortunately, I will not be back. Maybe it was just my luck. There is a chipotle down the road from this place I'd rather spend my money."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday !!!  I ordered two carne asada tacos no onions and guess what ? I got onions on my tacos , had to give them to my friend didn't order anymore . Disappointed oh yeah COLD a.. tortillas"}
{"text":"Best Tacos! Friendly staff! The restaurant is clean. Menu is simple which good. They also have a food truck and it has the same menu! Over all it is good, affordable and worth the wait if the line is long!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area but they have legit al pastor. I had a taco and a mulita. I ate the taco before taking a picture but it was delicious. Simple menu, excellent food. Plus you get complimentary grilled onion. Yes please!"}
{"text":"The menu is all in Spanish.  I don't speak Spanish even though I'm hispanic.  While that sucks, this place doesn't.  Get the pork taco!! Well, any taco is great.    This review is short, go there...NOW!"}
{"text":"Would not honor my Restaurant.com coupon. Poor customer service.   I came here with a measly $5 restaurant.com coupon, in order to be redeemed one had to purchase $7.50 worth of food, which shouldn't be a problem because each taco here costs $2+.   The girl ringing me up got her (what I assume to be) boss/owner/whatever on the phone and although I can only pick up a few words of Spanish here and there I knew what was going down. After much consternation on her part (and by the cook) they decided they would not honor my coupon. Why? Because, and I quote, \"They've been taking money from us.\". Whom? Restaurant.com? Well yes, I would assume so because they probably get a cut. I pointed out there's no expiry date, but they were not impressed. I've never had this happen to me before with a Restaurant.com coupon, but I've assumed it could happen.  Here's the thing though, I've had Restaurant.com coupons expire before. The website alerts you to the fact the owner has stopped accepting the coupons and allows you to exchange your coupon for another. Obviously Taco Tijuana just decided to stop honoring the coupons without telling Restaurant.com, which, in my mind is very bad form. Especially for those that had already purchased the coupon with intention to buy eventually. If it expires, or you don't want people coming in to use it - than just say so, don't leave people out in the lurch.  Also - here's another issue, if you have a customer that has a coupon from a reliable source, with no expiry date, shouldn't you just honor the coupon in order to keep a customer and save face? I would. In fact, I know a lot of very good establishments that would. Especially when the price you would be eating was only $10.95 (minus $5) which bring us to a whopping $5.95 they would have had to just let go in order to honor my non-expired coupon.   That being said what I ordered and subsequently paid full price for, even though all I really wanted to do was ditch my order and go down the street to Taco y Taco.  2 Adobada Tacos 2 Lengua Tacos 1 \"Especial\" Quesadilla 1 Orange Jarittos  The adobada tacos were good, but definitely could have used more meat. Spices were on point, but way too much freaking cilantro and onions. Lengua was okay. I've never had it before, so I'd be interested to see what it's like somewhere else before I make my final call on if I actually enjoy eating cow tongue tacos.  The especial quesadilla was disappointing. Hardly any cheese at all, and mostly meat. I asked for carne asada in it. The carne asada was really spicy - like everything here. You do not really need any salsas with these tacos because they are pre-seasoned to the spicy side.  There is no salsa bar. They grill up onions/peppers for you and you get that with your order  Customer Service - 1 Star Food - 2 Stars Restaurant/Ambiance - 1 Star  Overall - I'll be taking my taco business back to Taco y Taco from here on out."}
{"text":"Very clean and spacious taqueria with a simple menu (carne or pork - tacos or quesadillas). Fast service, perfect for lunch! Nothing fancy, the food is served on paper plates but the quality is great! The corn tortillas are made fresh! 20% off on Taco Tuesday and a free taco for \"checking in\" on yelp!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, open late, not sure what to think about the tacos. All was freshly made in front of me but there seemed to be a off eggy, taste to the tortilla. It overpowered the taste of the meat and, salsa, and cilantro. I really wanted to like but it fell short."}
{"text":"Soooo the al pastor was decent. Sweet but a lil fatty. The carne asada was great. The guac they put on everything was a little runny. The flavor was good tho. We tried everything on the menu and the carne asada quesadilla was my favorite. The red sauce is hot!"}
{"text":"The food is soooooo good. They have Taco Tuesdays there so it's a great deal. The size of the taco is great. The meat itself is delicious. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"This is once of the best tacos truck in town always busy because their tacos are amazingly delicious. Great service as well."}
{"text":"The food is very good and IMO is worth it on taco tuesdays. I went there but I got sick the next day and not sure if it was this or something else I ate.  The service was good as they were courteous and explained something I found confusing. The soft tacos are pretty tiny though..but you get three of them on one order if I remember correctly. Good place to try!"}
{"text":"D E L I C I O U S. Staff is super friendly and the handmade tortillas elevate these simple street tacos to infinity and beyond."}
{"text":"This was great food; very simple yet flavorful. My only humble suggestion as a consumer and fellow taco eater would be, use real avocado slices. That avocado purée is not tasty at all and takes away from the flavor of the taco.  I get why they use it (more cost effective) but raising the cost of tacos to have great ingredients would be ok."}
{"text":"Just what we have been waiting for. My favorite tacos are TJ street tacos. I've had different varieties of them here in Phx but don't get my fill of them until I go to San Diego. Well I think I finally found something that can hold off my SD Tijuana cravings. Yes Tacos Tijuana serves authentic Tijuana street tacos, and they are great!!! They have Al Pastor or Carne Asada tacos. Both are only $1.50. I also saw on the menu some other items but I concentrated on the tacos.  I couldn't help myself and ordered 8 tacos for my wife and I to share but I think I ate 5 of the,....lucky they are small but they pack a flavorful punch!!  I also loved the ambience of the food truck. It's a stationary more of a food trailer with a nice canopy. We went during sunset but the lights weren't on just yet. I'd like to come back during the night time to sit under the  Lights.   On a side note the employees were very friendly and will bring out your order when it's ready. Overall I have. Ow found my go to place for tacos in the valley and super excited it's not far from me!"}
{"text":"JUST what we needed!!!!! This taco truck is worth the wait. Don't forget to take some hot sauce home!!   What I loved most was seeing everyone in the truck working hard and just pumping out all this delicious food. My favorite is watching the tortillas get rolled and pressed!"}
{"text":"We visited Las Vegas with the family and wanted to eat some good Mexican food. So we found this place on good old yelp! From the moment we walked in our experience was terrific!! From the helpful cashier to the amazing cooks in the back.  Now as for the food... Excellent!! Had the carne asada burrito and I loved it! But the pastor was to die for. Salsa is on point! Their menu is simple, they've got it right! Wish I could get this kind of food in Cali! :( but at least we have a new spot when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Vampiros- great flavors yet pork was a bit tight and too fatty. Space is very new and clean, wishing for more menu items and sweets. Cannot beat the prices though!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight. A taco truck with tables and chairs alfresco. Great customer service. They accept cash or cards. I ordered 3  Carne Asada Tacos and they did not disappoint. They are small but it filled me up. They have bottled beverages.  Stop in and try them!"}
{"text":"OMG i haven't had amazing mexican food since leaving california. THIS place is so amazing. it was my first time- i got carne asada quesadillas. so happy my client told me about this place"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! Their food truck is great on thunderbird also. Tacos are a good price and the tortillas are fresh"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a long time and ended up here last month with my dad. They have a nice little set-up and a small menu...but, don't let that fool you. I've only had the carne aside quesadilla, but it was amazing! Next time I have a hankering for carne asada, I will be returning to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Omg! So good! We will definitely be back. The menu is simple, the frills are non existent here but damn they make great tacos."}
{"text":"I've had some medical problems and have had trouble eating. Stopped at this food truck and ate a bunch of tacos, and I am not a big guy. Amazing tacos!! Great value, friendly staff! Thank you!"}
{"text":"They have the best tacos by far. I live in central Phoenix and it's worth the drive. We came out twice this week already."}
{"text":"Tacos Tijuana never fails. I can come in any day of the week that they are open and consistently receive the same amazing and delicious tacos. Every time. Going to many taco spots, they always fall short because their tortillas don't quite hold up well, but not here. Not only do the homemade tortillas add flavor to the taco, they never compromise the taste of what's inside. And the guacamole, too! Never over-salted, allowing the flavors from the meat, the cilantro, onions, and tortilla to really compliment each other... can you tell I love this place yet?"}
{"text":"Truly authentic delicious tacos! Cute little place just minutes from the strip. Very very fresh! I'll defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch yesterday was a stop at Taco Tijuana.  The service is great.  The chef offered Eric R. a sample of the adobada.  He explained what everything was.  Eric R. ordered a mula with flour tortillas and suadero, and a cabeza taco.  The mula is like a tortilla sandwich with cheese and meat, so a deconstructed quesadilla of sorts, and comes with choice or corn or flour tortillas.  I ordered a lengua taco and a lengua sope.  The sope is like a corn cake that is stuffed with the meat, and here topped with a crispy corn chip.  The chef insisted we take an adobado taco con pina on the house, which was very nice but he did that only after I told him I do not eat pork.  Eric R. ate it.  There are radishes and limes but no salsa bar.  The lengua was delicious.  I have a hard time disliking any lengua taco in general, and this was very tasty.  The sope was great too - for me it was a fork-and-knife situation because it was very thick but too wide to lift up and bite.  Eric R. enjoyed his cabeza (\"tastes like suadero\" he said) and his mula.  He was so full but ate the adobada too.  We were only there for like 15 minutes but we smelled like burnt meat the rest of the day.  It was in my hair and my clothes, and same with my hubs - it was like we went to a local casino and smelled like smoke in a way.  Because of this affliction and the lack of a salsa bar, I knocked off a star.  Good food and great service, so enjoy!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this.  This location offers some of the best mexican food I've had in Las Vegas.  The prices are great, service is good.  Always a reliable experience."}
{"text":"Tacos!! Al pastor was my favorite! You  have to request pineapple if u like it that way. Suadero was really good as well!.: all the toppings onions, cilantro, salsa are added before handed to you. Asada was our least favorite :( not enough seasoning or flavor. The quality of all the tacos was still really good though!   There was no salsa bar.. No sides, and no handmade horchata. Those were our cons.   We also had the asada fries, .. Which was lots of sour cream and something like a guac cream.. Not bad but it came with shredded cheddar cheese.: and not nacho cheese. Which is what I for are reason expect.. :\ but not all places do. Anyways, the small portion was enough for my husband and I! He probably could of had more but he had already had 3 tacos. Lol   Regardless will be back for pastor tacos and pastor fries!! ^___^ ohh and the staff was super friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos are out of control good, crispy and crunchy while still tender and juicy."}
{"text":"The food is good, but lacks seasoning. There was absolutely zero spice to the meat.... tacos are kinda small, so get more then you think you need. Also I didn't expect to spend $30 for just my son and I.... kinda pricey for an outdoor/corner eatery. Very busy so people must really like it. I'll give it a meh.... my tacos I make at home are better, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Food was great, tortillas obviously \"homemade\" options are steak and pastor all you really need honestly, only thing that stopped this from a \"5star\" experience was the extreme heat. I assume this place has been here a while, you would think they'd invest in a couple of fans. Overall good stuff, just know to get it to go, or just wait til winter comes around."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after hearing a lot of good things about it. I was a little bit bummed that they didn't have burritos, but their street tacos are amazing! They offer al pastor and carne Asada meat, and they also have horchata and bottled coke, which is my favorite. Their prices are reasonable service was fast, and overall experience was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after seeing a show and shared an order of (4) adobada street tacos and a soda.  These tacos are consistently good.  The staff has always been very friendly.  I was allowed to use a restaurant.com certificate though the restaurant has dropped out of the program."}
{"text":"Over priced food tacos is my first thought. The place is dumpy looking but hey I thought maybe good food? So i thought I would try it. Menu is hard to read and set up of the place is completely off. We ordered and took food to go. I let the cashier know the menu was hard to read and letters weren't clear, his quick reply was \"oh what your the first one to ever say that, its not hard to read \" -something just like that. He was clearly bothered by what i said then handed my change back and didnt say a word.  Wow...   So I waited to get home and try my food and its mediocre. Not much flavor and dry. Save your money and go somewhere else! Albertos is better, do they have one of those around here?"}
{"text":"After almost 8yrs finally found a spot in PHX that has tacos that can  compete with  TJ/San Diego tacos...... clean, excellent customer service and delicious!!!! My fave extra crispy Al Pastor  taco and mulita!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Central Cali and currently living in Vegas going on 7 years . I haven't found the perfect taco joint ! I've been so disappointed. But may I express BEST TACO IN VEGAS I've tasted !  Bright Guest Service . Clean. Professional .  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"These tacos were ok. The staff was nice and friendly but they aren't from Tijuana and the tacos aren't that style either."}
{"text":"We've been here once and the tacos were good. But make no mistake they're not from Tijuana. The salsa is pretty good and they were friendly which gave a nice ambience. But the funny thing is they have never even been to Tijuana so not authentic."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight. The tacos are AMAZING! Worth the drive. Will definitely be back. :) this family should consider opening a restaurant."}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised... just a little truck sitting up the street from my house... I thought why not give it a try...best tacos around,  particularly the beef...eat there every week now.."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fast. Not open Monday or Sundays. Seems very popular because is always busy when I drive by here"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 starts beacuse i love the TACOS ALPASTOR !  Very friendly staff !!!! And very clean place. Love it my fav tacos shop"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and super nice staff. My husband ordered the tacos pastor with pork and really enjoyed them. The tacos come with a tomato sauce, guacamole, onions and cheese if you want it. Since I am vegetarian I asked for tacos with vegetables instead of meat. The tacos I received had all of the usual toppings as listed above plus an extra helping of onions. I should have been more clear about the vegetables I was expecting to replace the meat. Well we had a good laugh and I ended up ordering the quesadilla instead which were super tasty. They also offer bottled mexican sodas for purchase and complimentary hot sauce.  Overall cute little place, not a lot of atmosphere, but very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their tacos are soooo good!  We fell in love with this place from the the first time we walked inside. We moved from LA area 9 years ago and we could not find a place with original mexican tacos as good as this one. Totally recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"I always try pastor and asada tacos at each new taco spot I find. This place, while quite greasy, is some of the best I've EVER had. Well done"}
{"text":"Great food and very reasonable prices. We had both beef and pork tacos, which were both great (beef was the fav) and a beef quesadilla with everything....soooo good! Casual seating are and a very simple menu. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Tacos Tijuana for the first time this evening. I ordered both the carne asada and al pastor tacos. The food was amazing and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, cheap, quick and delicious.  First time but definitely not our last. Quesadilla with the pork was wonderful."}
{"text":"The al pastor is amazing!! I tried both carne asada and al pastor tacos and loved both of them. But I just haven't had such pork tacos that juicy."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Los Angeles and yelped Mexican cuisine while driving on tropicana. This small hide out is very clean, cordial and overall appetizing. I had the pork tacos, I didn't get crazy with the set plate options. They have a guacamole sauce that seals the $2 deal!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"OMG. These are great tacos. A very simple menu with just carne asada and al pastor beef or pork tacos quesadillas tacos with cheese Etc. The tortillas are very soft fresh and hot and the meats are marinated well and taste great with fresh veggies like onions and guacamole added. You will not be disappointed and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Very nicely seasoned meat and authentic home made tortillas! I'm from Chicago where the Mexican food (food in general) is amazing so Arizona has been extremely disappointing in comparison. I wish I would've known about this place 15 months ago when I moved out here. This place really impressed me and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Omg this place rocks!!! I'm a gringo and this place was delicious.  The people are so damn friendly and well worth it."}
{"text":"I can go on and on how great their tacos are, but I'd just be repeating what everyone else is saying...  If you like tacos, this place should be on your list!"}
{"text":"Great steak tacos. Had to order 2 more. Grilled peppers with quesadillas and the grilled onions also delicious."}
{"text":"Oh.My.God. Bomb ass street tacos! I got the asada (steak) tacos with cheese,  and an asada quesadilla! Everything was topped  with guacamole, diced onion, cilantro, limes and 1/4 grilled onion with the quesadilla.  NOM, Nom, nom. Everything was delicious. They also have Mexican sodas and Coke. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I can see why they got 2017 best Street tacos. Tacos were perfect and quick service as well as friendly staff."}
{"text":"Don't let the Super simple menu fool you ! 3 steak carne  asada Tacos totally hit the spot. The guac was amazing and beef was very tender. Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent gem on the corner, service was excellent and the street tacos were very tasty, definitely try the carne asada tacos, well Wirth the trip for our first time!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb bomb. Homemade tortillas. Can't go wrong with that. Hooked already. Come on down solo or with the fam bam."}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar lengua tacos. Also tried buche and al pastor. Another great Vegas hole in the wall.  Friendly service Would definitely return."}
{"text":"There can't be a better taco than this.  Seriously. As authentic as it gets, fantastic presentation, taste and alll around amazing.   Ordered a taco de Asada and couldn't be happier. The meet was tender and flavorful, cilantro was fresh and the taco shell itself is the tastiest variety I have had!   With the trip out of the main drag for it for sure."}
{"text":"The best tacos around. Get the pastor, an old family recipe, outstanding! Simple, quick and a great vibe."}
{"text":"They started out as a truck, and now have a brick and mortar space to serve some of Arizona's best tacos. You don't make it this far without being good!   Yes, you only get two options. But it's the best carne asada in town! Incredibly taste al pastor as well. If you don't feel like regular tacos, you can order these in a quesadilla, which is amazing, or the tacos vampiros, which are equally amazing. Vampire tacos have cheese melted onto a crispy taco shell before adding all the fixins. It is amazing. You cannot go wrong. Eat here."}
{"text":"The motto is no b.s: \"Not Just Any Taco! Goooooood Taco!\" Grabbed two Asada tacos and my mouth was like what part of heaven did this taco come from? The handmade corn tortillas are thicker than the a regular ass corn tortilla so when you bite into the taco all the flavors get a DASH of this corn essence that makes you just go OoooooOooOoo!! And I have no idea where else there is horchata and agua de piña on fountain drink mode!!! OMG OMG! Long story short, I should have grabbed 3 tacos."}
{"text":"This place is great. A limited menu should not deter you from visiting this joint. It's a food truck with a dining area... prices are quite reasonable, and the carne asada tacos were very tasty.  I just heard that they are opening an actual restaurant in the near future. Can't wait for that!"}
{"text":"Went to Taco Tijuana on a Saturday afternoon.  The staff couldn't have been more friendly, very helpful in deciding which tacos to try.  I had the carne asada, adobada, and suadero.  Oh, and when I had eaten the adobada, I had to order another.  It was the clear winner.  Taco Tijuana doesn't have the usual salsa bar that most taco joints have, but they make the tacos with specific toppings, rather than just the onion/cilantro topping.  I loved this, I was more than happy to trust them with how to dress the tacos.  The carne was a little lacking in flavor for my tastes, but that doesn't mean I didn't care for it.  But, as noted above, the adobada was fantastic.  Tender with some good spice from the sauces.  The tacos are packed full, each bite has an abundance of toppings.  When I return, it will be a challenge not to order a bunch of adobada and nothing else...."}
{"text":"Lisa and I stopped at this little taco stand today homemade corn tortillas carne asada tacos pretty tasty a dollar fifty each not a bad price. They're open from 10 to 10 everyday except for Sunday. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos!!! Excellent set up! The outdoor seating was clean and plentiful. Just happened to be there on Taco Tuesday and got 10% off."}
{"text":"When your craving carne asada tacos and you want simplicity then this is your spot to go to! They also offer 20% off on Taco Tuesday's, and you can order ahead of time! The corn tortillas are homemade even though I believe my grandmother and miners are much tastier. But still what Taco stand have you gone too that makes there own corn tortillas ?!   Definitely makes my list of top places to go to when your craving tacos!"}
{"text":"Whoa!!! This place is spectacular. Pineapple on your street tacos is a brilliant idea. It may not look so great from the outside but the service, food and employees were great!!! I will definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesday special are awesome!!!!! Tacos al pastor are so delicious!!!! Always my favorite"}
{"text":"Hola. Deberían abrir un nuevo Tacos Tijuana en henderson Nv porque en henderson necesitan más variedad de tacos especialmente en boulder highway y lake mead parkway porque hay mucha construcción y negocio nuevos y hay mucho tráfico."}
{"text":"I don't know how it gets much better than Tacos Tijuana in Las Vegas. I have had tacos literally alllll over the American Southwest and throughout MANY trips through Mexico.  I like to think I know tacos. Tacos Tijuana does a variety of Mexican foods well but their tacos and steak fries are truly tough to beat anywhere. I always go for a steak taco, plus either a carnitas or a delicious pastor and then split a steak fries with my wife.  The avocado cream sauce that they put on their steak fries is the best I've ever had anywhere, it's amazing.   I imagine based on how wonderful their steak fries are that they also make a mean California burrito.  The lines are never long, the location feels slightly unsafe- but such is the case with all of Vegas's best fast eats spots. The danger is well rewarded.  Can wait to go back again for the 20th or 30th time lol"}
{"text":"Great, hand made , cheap eats. Best tacos anywhere. You must try this place. Food truck, tent, parking lot. Can't get better than this."}
{"text":"Ok so found out about this place on Facebook, came and ordered two tacos. Came back the very next day and ordered four tacos. The meat is juicy and flavorful, the toppings are fresh and the salsa is spicy and nice. I had a couple of gristley bits, but I didn't even mind it. The tortillas are freshly made. We tried both the carne Asada and al pastor tacos, and also the cheese quesadilla. Everything is a winner. I feel bad, but I might have to jump ship from Waldo's taco truck... Nah, I'll still eat both. BTW don't make the same mistake I did and try to make a lunch out of this, they do not open until 5:30pm."}
{"text":"Very good tacos. I just wish they had more than two varieties. Yes their carne asada and al pastore are some of the best I've had, so imagine what they could do with some carnitas or tripa or even fish tacos. Come on TJ tacos, help a brother out."}
{"text":"Food is great but everything else stinks. The carne has great flavor as do the salsitas. Ordered the grilled onion and pepper and its even better. Simple and fresh but i have been there for lunch and dinner and anymore than 5 or 6 people waiting to order and I leave. It takes forever and sometimes the person taking orders is also clearing tables. Anyone with 1 good community college business class could double the revenues here quick. Good food is great but coupled with poor service and sticky tables and its always a maybe."}
{"text":"As a Mexican I was pretty much raised eating tacos, it took a while before I found a place that got even close to the taste. This place exceeded my expectations! My favorite: Carne Asada Tacos and Al Pastor Tacos.   If you are looking for good real Mexican tacos... and great costumer service, then you have found the right place at Tacos Tijuana."}
{"text":"This place was all we were told it would be. Great Tacos, fries all orbit was delicious. Great service from the front staff to the kitchen!!!"}
{"text":"Aside from the sassy cashier, this place is A+ perfection. You can order an assortment of burritos, soft tacos, fries, etc with any kind of toppings and meat. The chefs are quick and the food is great. I think the price is slightly higher than what they should be charging, but if I'm ever craving a kick ass burrito I might suck it up until i find someplace cheaper and just as good."}
{"text":"Taco Tijuana is one of my favorite taco shops in town! You have to get the tacos de adobada AKA al pastor tacos! You'll know it's the right one if it's the reddish colored pork on the spit! It normally comes without pineapple, so ask if you want some. The other super tasty taco here is the tacos de tripa, which is deep fried pig intestines. The carne asada here is okay, I know a couple places that make it better.  All orders come with a side of peppers and grilled onions. The self serve bar has radishes and limes.  My only complaint was the horchata here is kind of weak.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 45/100"}
{"text":"Straight and to the point excellent tacos and nothing else. Also be sure to try a Mexican Coke if you're wanting to get diabetes at an early age."}
{"text":"Best Street Tacos in Glendale .....Great Service ...Excellent Prices .... Tacos are Amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"I've had better tacos, I give them A for effort. The meat was season very well. I wish they had sour cream, cilantro, beans and flour tortillas. But other than they were okay."}
{"text":"Checked out Taco Tijuana again!  After my review on Yelp, management said that the old chorizo WAS store bought, and that's why it was not as flavorful and dry. So they invited us back to give the new recipe a whirl!  The new chorizo definitely has more flavor...more spices in it, and more taste. The consistency is still a bit on the dry side, but the seasoning makes it taste great :)  The Al Pastor didn't pack the same punch though...but still good! It is still a bit oily/greasy compared to most, but that's a good thing!   Still a great place to get your taco fix!"}
{"text":"Best Street Taco stand in the west valley!!! Fast service GOOD meat and the most wonderful corn tortillas!"}
{"text":"Was decent..not great but not terrible, I will attempt to try it again to give it a fair shot.  The one thing I ABSOLUTELY HATED about the food was the pulverized cabbage & onion mix. It really really grossed me out. I would say if that had not had been on my tacos I would have enjoyed them much more. If they just made the pieces chopped instead of blended until they were almost a paste it would be much better. But it made my food watery. The service was good, the price was fair, they were really nice and I'm happy they are doing well. Just not my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm so turned off from showing up and waiting my turn in line and someone in front holds a spot for a ridiculous amount of family or friends and cut in front of you.  It's a regular line control issue that needs to to be addressed.  It's one thing to all  be walking up. But after waiting for 10 minutes to have one friend, than after your ridiculously long order and paying your friend orders then pays, then just when you think they are done another member and another  and eventually what was a 10 minute wait, becomes a 20 minute wait, all to be told when you arrive there's so many orders in front of you it's 45 minutes wait now.  I walked out and am struggling with my love for this place.  Please address it because you will lose more customers for this kind of poor line management."}
{"text":"I always visit the truck place in Thunderbird but I wanted to try the restaurant. First thing we noticed when we opened the door and walked inside is the strong sewer smell that welcomed us, it was gross so I decided to save a table outside. I noticed the lack of customer service, the lady at the register was kind of rushing us and the place wasn't even that busy. The guy who gave us the drinks never smiled at all. The food came out super fast, I did appreciate that because in the truck place the food take a looong time to come out. The tacos were delicious, the steak and pork were very tender. I'm glad that they have Horchata, I also liked the salsas. I will give them more stars if it wasn't for the customer service and the bad smell."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time Saturday. Staff was super nice. Wish we would have gotten twice as many tacos... they were DELISH!!! we got the carne asada tacos... we will most definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Seriously. Just a food truck on the side of the road. Super yummy and super cheap. The al pastor is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Meat was not very good.  Salsa had no flavor.  Service was ok. Went during the week. It was pretty empty.  2 stars cause bathroom was very clean lol."}
{"text":"Wow....them tripas tacos were yummy.  Crispy goodness.......bought it for a buck each.  Need I say more for their Tues-only deals?"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place other than it's awesome. Both kinds of tacos are AWESOME. Closest you're going to get to tacos from TJ (of which I've had many) without crossing the border. I try every street taco joint I can find and this is the real deal. Muy Bueno. The hot sauces are also on point. Mexican soft drinks. The guac is the \"fluid\" kind, not the chunky style, that's their only downfall. OH yeah - the Pastor is done on the vertical spit like it should be...that tells you what you need to know.  IF you under-order the amount of tacos, no worries...they check on your table regularly and will be glad to bring you some more. Yes, they take cards in addition to cash...  Don't go here because I don't want to wait for these tacos!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of the truck on 67/Tbird. However, we thought we'd give the brick and mortar a shot. It's in that plaza with Harbor Freight and Planet Fitness, which ulitmately brings in a whole different crowd thatn the truck does!  The tacos are just as good, the al pastor maybe better than the truck? The carne asada was a tad on the dry/cool side but still tasty. Maybe they over prepped for taco tuesday and we had just missed lunch? Luckily, we got there when we did because as we left after 9 tacos between 2 of us, the line was heading out the door.   They have nice patio seating and the \"hot\" salsa was hot that day! Being housemade daily, it obviously varies with each pepper batch. The only drawback I see coming their way is it has to be way more expensive in rent for them than the truck, so they'll need to perhaps add beer/wine and maybe offer sides like rice or black beans to kick things up a notch from the truck.   Like I said, the crowd is different...not everyone is willing to pull up their mercedes/volvo/whatevs into a parking lot and eat at a truck, this is more conducive to that. Oddly, it seemed that it also means many peeps run in after a workout or whatever and grab a bunch of tacos to go. That's great form a business standpoint but it's totally illogical from a street taco lover's standpoint. The whole point of grabbing a street taco is cramming it in your mouth right then and there, not 10 minutes later. Of course, I've been known to go to TJ for tacos when I lived in SD and have even ventured to Nogales at midnight from PHX before decent street tacos were a thing here. Luckily, we have options nowadays and this is one of the better ones on the West side. Check it out."}
{"text":"The tacos are pretty good! Only thing I wish it had is some cilantro. Just add that and the tacos will be perfect!"}
{"text":"First time here! I hear it's the new place in town! Ive received a lot of recommendations of Tacos Tijuana."}
{"text":"First time visit and this place did not disappoint! Both Carne Asada & Al Pastor had so much flavor and was tender and juicy. Their thick corn tortillas were a nice surprise as they were durable yet soft. Each bite melts in your mouth. The atmosphere was clean and casual with soft lighting and subtle/upbeat music playing in the background. Overall wait time was about 20 min. but it was well worth it! Excellent and friendly  service from taking my order down to handing me my order after checking each box to make sure it was correct. Fire roasted red salsa and green salsa both had good flavor with enough kick. I'm no longer on the hunt for a good street taco and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"These are truly the best tacos in town. And we've had to suffer in the heat in the cold to go get them at the truck and it was all worth it! But they just opened a sit down style restaurant southwest corner of 51st Ave. and Bell we ate lunch there same delicious tacos at a great price"}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot for my street taco cravings. 20% off taco Tuesday's. Homemade torilla's. They only serve 2 choices of meat. Carne asada & al pastor!   This place gets busy, real fast! So sometimes the wait can be a while. Especially if you come during the lunch and dinner rushes. They also have a limited amount of tables so I usually always end up taking it to go.  The red salsa has mild flavor but pack a pretty good spice punch. The green salsa, I'm not much a fan of. I feel like that one tastes watered down to me, it lacks flavor. These tacos are good and flavorful enough that I don't really need go add the salsa.   My favorite had to be the al pastor. Nice and juicy. Marinated perfectly. You get a little bit of fat on the pork in your bite which really tops it off for me because it's just the perfect amount. Not overwhelming at all.   I just wished they offered a few more meat choices."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Best in the valley. Compares to Tijuana local tacos -- I've been there."}
{"text":"This place is a little food truck off the north west corner of 67th and greenway. They have a very simple menu that consist of 2 meats.. Carne Assad or pork, which is all they really need because both are amazing! Very authentic Mexican food and everything is made by scratch."}
{"text":"I was complaining my Mexican friends that I cant find the tacos i ate in Mexico. They suggested this place. Although, its really far away from where I live, I always find time to drive to taste their tasty food."}
{"text":"Fresh, high quality, authentic, clean, great service... in short, amazing! Just like in México!"}
{"text":"Amazing family run taco place.  Delicious food.  Was recommended by friends.  Reminds me of Los Angeles street tacos.  Very friendly service and very inexpensive.  A great experience."}
{"text":"I travel to Tijuana 3+ times per year and my favorite food of choice is street tacos.  When Tacos el Gordo then Taco Tijuana opened I was ecstatic! But alas, I was so dissaopinted with Taco Tijuana.  I usually ordered the Adobada tacos, you can't go wrong with Adobada, however time after time it was utter dissapointment.  The tacos were dripping with grease, I know, normal in tacos, BUT TO A POINT! When you open the tacos you can see liquid grease pooled in the bottom, about a tablespoon worth.  The meat is a joke, they also have about a tablespoon of meat in each tacos.    If you need to get your Tijuana street taco fix, skip this place and head towards Charleston, if you want tacos and are on a tight budget go for Taco Tijuana for their 2×1 tacos..."}
{"text":"You guys totally rocked my socks. I've been wanting to try these tacos for a while now but I live far away. We were in the neighborhood and I was able to finally stop in. I had Alpastor tacos and a beef vampiro. The homemade corn tortillas are so wonderful. I wolfed all of it down on the car ride home. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I had to change mine to 5 Stars! New flatscreen menu board and their new  tortillas are so good!    The salsa here has one hell of a kick! I'll keep coming back for the carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"Not as busy as el gordo..but just as good.   The taco makers are alot more friendly here. But is the same quality.  the sister properties taste the same."}
{"text":"These tacos are garbage. If you're from Southern California and have eaten actual good tasting tacos, you'll hate this place. The carnitas were more dry than kitty litter, I could have soaked up my drink with them. The al pastor taco was filled with more green sauce than meat. Don't give it a try, it's not worth it. Note to employees... if anyone asks for only onions and cilantro on their taco. That does not mean avocado is okay to put on... On top of the terrible food our cashier had an attitude far worse than the taste of the food"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  DELISH tacos and great service, every time. Not far from Midwestern University either!  Perfect for exhausted graduate students who often need to eat their feelings!!"}
{"text":"As a Tijuana regular I can vouch that these tacos are as legit as its gonna get this side of the border. Five stars for the handmade yellow corn tortillas! This is reason enough to come back. All of it was soo good!"}
{"text":"I have had quite a few different styles and tastes of carne asada tacos.  Yes, they need to serve chicken, but they weren't bad.  I would say the service is pretty fast and price is ok.   Any meat that is used- restaurants need to pick thru and remove the fat.  I hate biting and getting fat or gristle.  Stay on top of that and you'll be a 5 . The pork tacos were delish.   I will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Better than Taco Taco and Tacos El Gordo? I don't think so!  Taco Taco has much better Al Pastor and tortillas. Taco Tijuana is extremely generous with their meat unlike TEG where they are a little stingy. But quality counts more than quantity and I feel that Taco Tijuana is one rung down from the top two places. Probably deserves a solid 3.5 star rating. Taco Taco is still #1.  BTW, MUCHAS GRACIAS to whomever wrote these two magic words here on Yelp; \"bien doradito\" has changed my life so much for the better."}
{"text":"The absolute worst quesadilla I've ever seen in my life. I thought the first time they might have Just miss cooked, no. Second time was even worse, does almost 8 dollars for this???? Wtf, never fucking again. Negative stars"}
{"text":"Excellent!! Simple menu, phenomenal flavor. Perfectly seasoned Carne Asada and Pastor tacos. Quick and attentive service, easy on the wallet. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!   I got off work the other night and was going to get myself some grub.  It was either going to be a Sonoran hot dog, or some tacos.  Tacos won!  I had seen this place pop up on Yelp recently, and it wasn't too far from work.  I drove down, parked in the lot, walked up to the podium and placed my order.  There are only 2 choices here...carne asada and al pastor.  You can get a taco, quesadilla, or mulita.  I went with 3 carne asada tacos, 3 al pastor tacos and a Coke to drink.  Total was right under $12.00.  I took a seat at one of their tables, and about 15 minutes later, my tacos were ready.  Here is how they were...........  Carne Asada-  These come with carne asada, onions, guacamole and cabbage (It's a Phoenix thing...the cabbage.  I got mine without cabbage!).  These tacos are a bit small (2 biters) but they were delicious.  The carne asada had a great smokey flavor, and was tender as could be.  The meat is piled onto a home made corn tortilla.  The tortillas were a bit chewier/wet than some of my favorite taco stands, but they were still good!  Some of the best carne asada I have found so far in Phoenix.  4 stars!  Al Pastor-  Wow!  Topped the same as the carne asada tacos.  They have the spit of pork roasting in the truck, and they slice it right off of there into the tortilla.  First bite in, these tacos tasted IDENTICAL to my favorite spot in San Diego (Tacos El Gordo).  This al pastor was legit as fuck!  Just like the carne asada tacos, they were a bit skimp on the meat, but they also only cost $1.50.  Flavor wise though, damn good and these could hold their own compared to other great al pastor places in San Diego and Tijuana.  5 stars!  Coke- Mexican Coke in a glass bottle.  The best!  Overall, I was very impressed!  The tacos were damn good and were some of the best tacos I have had so far in Phoenix.  Only complaint is that it took awhile to get your food, and the tacos were a tad skimp on the meat.  Other than those 2 small gripes, flavor wise and authenticity were pretty much perfect!  I now know where to get my late night taco fix at!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the tacos I get right across the border in Sonoita. Handmade corn tortillas. Whether you get the carne asada or el pastor, you really can't go wrong. My new to-go place for authentic tacos!"}
{"text":"After getting food poisoning at Tacos El Gordo I paused on eating tacos for a minute which sucks cuz I REALLY LOVE TACOS! Anyways this place is by my bf's house and we decided to try it out...  Words cannot describe how savory and delicious these tacos are! Even the burritos are big and fat and fulfilling! I LOVED EVERY single bite! Even my boyfriend stopped eating at Tacos El Gordo! I love that it's a little hidden treasure lol (I was always got annoyed from how busy Tacos El Gordo got busy) but yes! Do try it!! Plus the staff are so cute & nice!!! Reminds me of my elderly relatives!!! :-) thumbs up!! Fresh tacos!!!"}
{"text":"It's my boyfriend and I's 2nd time here and as always, this taco truck deserves more than 5 stars. I always order the al pastor and carne asada taco. It's authentic and delicious. The place is in the parking lot so don't go there during lunch because u know Az weather. Good service too."}
{"text":"Really great and authentic tacos! I wish on taco Tuesday, they did a bigger discount like half off tacos instead of 20% off each one to make it more enticing against there competitors. The salsa is often warm despite sitting in an ice chest and the tables are pretty sticky to sit at. However, this is the best carne asada you will get in Arizona, tender and delicious. The al pastor is yummy but occasionally it's been a little tough as it's been over cooked my last couple visits. The staff and crew is super awesome, Indrha always makes sure my family and I are taken care of."}
{"text":"First time here today and THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! The tacos carne asada are tasty, and the horchata is amazing. This will be my go to place after work to get tacos!!"}
{"text":"If you want a real Mexican Taco, this is the place to go. Tortillas pressed out in front of you, meat simmering in different pots, and a warm welcome by the staff.   A humble business with authentic flavors, the best of Las Vegas has been found!!!!  I had four tacos, I couldn't stop ordering them.  They have pork belly, pork al pastor, pork shoulder, beef steak, beef head and beef tongue, the accompanying sauces were phenomenal...avocado sauce, salsa verde, chili verde and more.  This is a must visit any time you are in town.  If there were a sixth star they would get it."}
{"text":"Just. Amazing. Tacos. First time coming here and will not be the last. Tacos are priced great. Everything tasted great and fresh. You will not be disappointed with your visit."}
{"text":"Good place. Lots of choices to choose from They have specials if the day Tables are always clean when I visit    It's off a Main Street so please be careful entering and exiting venue."}
{"text":"My family and I randomly decided to take a walk from our apartment to get tacos. We decided to try this place because we always pass this place and wonder.   As we came in, it seemed crowded (4:30pm on a Saturday), but soon noticed that we had to order in the corner immediately to the right. I understood then, that the unfortunate placing of the register, gives for the impression that this place is always packed. When in reality, it's not.   We ordered a few tacos asadas and adobado and my hubby went for the \"fries asada\" or \"asada fries.\" After giving the cooks their copy of the receipt, we took our seats and the food was ready almost immediately.   EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME. I squeezed some lime over everything and dove right in. The guacamole on the fries along with bits for juicy steak pieces, sour cream and a cheese blend sprinkled on top WERE SUPER DELICIOUS AND PERFECTLY TEXTURED, FOR EVERY SINGLE BITE.   Of the two variety of tacos we got, the adobado was the best. So good in fact I'm not even going to bother ordering any other kind of taco.   This is our new fave taco place. We will try others, but the standards have been set by Taco Tijuana."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place!!!  This is my spot to get TJ tacos. Growing up in SoCal driving with family to TJ to get tacos was amazing.  Everytime we go we order. 3 Adobada tacos, 1 Lengua Taco, Quesadilla Especial, and Carne Asada Fries. Everything we get is fresh and made to order which us nice. Pros: Small menu but good food Always clean Fast service  Ochata!! Cons: Yellow walls! Lol  It gets a lil warm"}
{"text":"Great carne asada and al pastor tacos on house made corn tortillas. Stark atmosphere but a great value."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have had in a while. Best bang for your buck. No one item on the menu is bad. Vampiros and mulitas are a must!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, great place to sit outside and get some tacos.  Some of the best tasting tacos in the valley and the cheapest. You can not go wrong here at all.  I highly suggest stopping by."}
{"text":"Super yummy! So happy they opened up at this location! I also love the patio area they have too..."}
{"text":"The cashier and cooks were friendly and my carne asada tacos were good. The place was plain but clean when I went in. The other gals I was with had the breakfast chorizo burrito, and the other a tripas taco. No complaints from them either."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in years!  I moved here from Southern California.  I've tried finding traditional tacos likes these in LA and Tijuana for years, and it wasn't until today that I relived the experience of tasteful tacos I used to get when visiting Tijuana and eating tacos as a child.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Están buenos y baratos los recomiendo gente de Tijuana aquí están sus tacos pero hace falta mas sucursales porque me quedan muy lejos y les faltan los de tripitas"}
{"text":"If u love real mexican style street tacos with flavor this is yur place...their quesadilla de asada and pastor tacos are the real deal...yur mouth will water when savoring these delicious treats with meats...if ever in vegas this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos. Bummed they ran out of Guac but tacos,militias and quesadillas were very good."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best tacos in town. The menu is limited to carne asada and al pastor, you can get the meats in a few different preparations. With the limited menu, it really lets them focus on quality and they prepare both kinds of meat perfectly. The carne asada is flavorful and seasoned perfectly and the al pastor has an immense amount of depth and the perfect amount of fat the melts away as you chew. The tortillas they use for the tacos are super fresh and soft with the right amount of chew. All items come garnished with onions, cilantro, guacamole and tomato sauce. They bring out a bottle of salsa for you and garnish the plate with a lime wedge as well. Nothing is forgotten here in my mind, it's simple, properly prepared tacos and I always look forward to going back. A true gem for the west valley. The location on 67th and Thunderbird is amazing as well."}
{"text":"This place is authentic with the best tacos in the area! Definitely recommend! The ambiance is great and the service is good as well. The horchata is made fresh and they have great salsas."}
{"text":"Omg !!! Estos si son tacos ! No paque ir a Tijuana por los tacos !!!! Thank you !!!!  I will be back soon ! Both tacos de asasda and pastor and the mulitas perfect !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best street tacos close to home this side of the border. I like that it's outside, simple just like street tacos should be. The line can be a little long at times but worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of our favorite taco places! Great tasting, cheap tacos. Tortilla are made in house and so tasty. Salsa is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Times inaccurate because they close whenever they want. Showed up at 1220, well before closing time yet an employee manned at the door was able to tell me They were closed before I could walk in."}
{"text":"Another place I've been driving by for years and never thought to try (and I'm pretty loyal to Taco y Taco).  My friend likes this place so we decided to stop in for a quick dinner.  I would say the tacos here are pretty solid.  I liked that they ask if you want \"everything\" on them because I always do.  The cabeza is oily (like dripping from the taco oily) but eh I kind of expect a lot of fat on that particular one so it didn't bother me too much.  Yeah, the tacos are a bit expensive but they do give a good amount of meat so I can't be too mad.    The service was quick and we got our food pretty fast.  I liked the condiment bar because there was a LOT of ice and the pickles seemed totally house made (they use clove! depth of flavor is on point) and had great flavor (even if the jalapeno was too spicy for me to eat).    The restaurant itself is super clean and there is plenty of seating.  I will say I was intimidated by the menu.  It was slightly confusing and I couldn't be quite clear on what they had.  I grew up without anything closely related to actual Mexican food and even after all these years in Vegas, I get a little anxiety about ordering but again friendly staff so it was fine."}
{"text":"As my buddies Migos would say, little place, paper plates, big taste wooo put it... In yo.. face. Rain drop drop top... If you are looking for a place so tasty it forces you to have an inner conflict every day you drive by it as to whether or not you want to stop there, this is the one. I was going to lose a few pounds this month but I can see that that's not going to happen now that I found Tacos Tijuana."}
{"text":"Great place to grab authentic street tacos! So if you are looking for some good street tacos this is your spot! My family loves it!"}
{"text":"Simple menu but excellent food! The best I've had in the state.  The Mulitas are my fave followed by the tacos. Carne Asada or al pastor, doesn't matter they are great."}
{"text":"tacos are very close to tj quality. hard to find. tortillas are fresh and hand made. not cheap but they are definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos.... best we have had in along time, this side of the border! We were served fast ,great prices. Salsa was very hot !"}
{"text":"This is the place to come for authentic Mexican tacos. Don't sell yourself short. They know what they are doing here. Usually you have to go way south just to get this kind of Mexican treatment but look no further make your way over here.  You won't regret it !!!!!"}
{"text":"Prepare to wait at least 30 minutes or more. Tacos are decent for this side of town.  The salsa for the tacos are good, but limited menu options."}
{"text":"Hands down! Best tacos. Better than the overrated Tacos El Gordo. The burrito is bomb and good size. The tortillas are hand made. The prices are great and the service is great. Always a great experience from food to service every time we come here."}

{"text":"Fantastic tacos! Come everyone!!! Great food and service and tacos and pop and atmosphere!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always just get the tacos. They also have carne asada fries, but just get tacos. They also have pretty good horchata, jamaica and tamarindo. I like to ask for cheese on my taco, but it comes automatically with salsa, onions and cilantro. Also, they don't charge extra for guacamole!"}

{"text":"False advertisement menu quesadillas look like mini tacos such a rip off I pay good money for good food and I expect to get what I'm promised in return very disappointed do not recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had both the Crane Assada and the Al Pastor with everything on it."}
{"text":"Good spot I'm from San Diego and god dame you want a tj taco got to try this spot looks ghetto but the home cook meal is worth it"}
{"text":"The last time I went the tacos were amazing and delicious! I recommend to get the carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  Saw tacos tijuana a couple of weeks ago and being from tijuana I had to try it. 38 miles from my house but worth the drive. Clean, friendly and the tacos are the best I've tried in Arizona so far. Only Carne asada and al pastor. And yes, for a moment I felt I was in Tijuana again. This is the real thing. Will be coming back whenever I go to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Besides hot dogs, what other addicting simple street food is there? T-A-C-O-S, Tacos! Indeedy deed! But these aren't your average run of the mill tacos.    What separates Tacos Tijauna from the pack is the use of handmade corn tortillas, in the literal sense too.  You can see them pressing freshly made dough and flattening them out for the next order.  It does not get any better than that.  On top of that, you can see a hunk of meat rotating on their heating device, which I believe is their Al Pastor.  That is the way I like to see my street food come off of.   Unlike most Taco places and trucks, the menu is very easy to order off of.  You either pick Al Pastor or Carne Asada for your taco choices.  Besides that you can get cheese quesadillas with some meat included.  I would say, I have enjoyed both very much but I have a personal liking for the Al Pastor.  To put the tacos into words, I would say its simple, flavorful, textured and addicting.  I believe the key trait about the tacos that makes them 'Tijuana' is that they always add a little drop of guacamole spread on every tacos unless you specify otherwise.    $1.50 gets you a taco! It can get super busy on any given night but its worth the little wait.  I've seen folks come just to order to go.  The folks who run this little awesome business are super kind and friendly.    I live walking distance to here, so I'm a very happy camper, I get to enjoy street tacos whenever I want."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in the Valley! Awesome prices, delicious, fresh ingredients. I come once a week and am consistently impressed"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place so we decried to give it a try. There is no shortage of places to get street tacos in my area, so the competition is stiff. They only offer a few items on their menu, but what they do offer, they do it well. As with a by street tacos, they are small, but the price is very reasonable. Actually their everyday price is cheaper than most Taco Tuesday prices offered by most other places.   They operate out of a food truck in a parking lot of a bike shop, and they get busy. They are fast about getting the food out to you and have developed a pretty good system to make it go fast.   I suggest you try them for a cheap and easy bite if you are craving some street tacos."}
{"text":"Someone told me this place was a must try.. I love tacos so why not?! Adobada tacos were just good, nothing I would go back for that's for sure. Everything else was a fail. Asada meat was not good in tacos or fries. Service from the staff is not welcoming or helpful. You literally have to ask for everything. My sister ordered a glass bottle coke & the cashier gave it to her without offering to open it or showing her where a bottle opener is located. You know taco spots are supposed to give you cebollas asada, chiles, & pineapple. They didn't offer it to us so we asked & they were quite stingy. I ordered an elote as well. No chile powder & they use Valentina. Bathrooms were not clean. Overall, it's not terrible but there's definitely better tacos spots in town."}
