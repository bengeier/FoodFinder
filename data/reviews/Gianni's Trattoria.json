{"text":"Love Gianni's! Fantastic food every time. Adult waiters and waitresses that know the menu. Awesome cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Just finished our 35th anniversary dinner. Food was good. Not exceptional, just good. The ambiance was terrible. While trying to enjoy our antipasto, we had to listen to the loud chef/owner having a Q & A with a bunch of women that had to do with everything from opening a restaurant to cooking the pasta. I also sat with an empty water glass while eating the antipasto and salad. After our meal, we were offered the choice of looking at the dessert menu. We sat at an empty table for 15 minutes before the dessert menu showed up. Only to find out most of the desserts listed weren't available. 3 stars because food was good. The entire experience was not. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Wow what a gem in downtown concord!! Truly was not expecting much at all!! But man were we shocked by the quality of food.   The Italian cuisine rivals any you would get in Manhattan.  The muscle bound owner is a hoot ! Gives the place a lot of charm !"}
{"text":"Pizza is not great, but pasta is amazing!!!! Fresh, local ingredients. We had our rehearsal dinner catered by them and are still receiving compliments on the food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Gianni's for dinner around 6pm.  We were only the second table to be seated.  Here is the short version.  The place is decent inside.  I read in another review that \"Gianni's is definitely the finest dining in Concord without question\", this is a mistake, it is the ONLY \"fine dining\" or attempt at fine dining in Concord.  The wait staff are dressed correctly but are in no way trained in fine dining.  Our waitress was nice enough but just didn't know.  The owner is an authentic Italian and he most definitely reinforces the stereo type movie \"I-talian\". He stopped by our table to ask how everything was in his best wise guy accent adorned with lots of gold jewelry and the signature Italian horn hanging over his (insert racial remark T-shirt) along with lots of body hair and a cell phone hanging off his side.  I don't know if it's for show or it's the real him, but my wife and I are both of Italian decent and having been brought up around Boston's North End we all know a few of these guys both authentic and wannabes.  Not quite who you want hanging over your dinner plate!  The never ending pizza take out traffic didn't help the dining experience either.  One woman came dressed in her jammies with slippers on (common occurrence here in the south) to pick up pizza.  It is somewhat uncomfortable when you're sitting there dressed up having dinner with suspecting unbathed people passing close by your table to pick up pizza.
Never the less the food is good, well-seasoned and cooked right.  Go for what it is, decent food with somewhat entertaining antics at times, but don't expect much more than that.   We got friends who loves this place and they said the pizza traffic has been recently rerouted as to not pass through the dining room.  I went to check it out on the website but their account has been suspended!!  

We've been back to the tratt for lunch a couple times since our last review titled \"Not Fine Dining\" which it isn't, but we gave the food a very good rating. Lunch is incredible, just for the sole reason the food is creative, seasoned well, tastes good, and is inexpensive. So refreshing to have a place to go that isn't some mindless franchise. If it wasn't for the all the pronoucing of R's and drawn out words, we could have been in the North End of Boston at any one of the authentic italian joints tucked into some nook on a side street with the smell of garlic sauteeing in olive oil. NICE. I'm going to take back my statement that we'll be \"suspending our patronage\" as who cares if its fine dining or not, all I know is that for 6.99 you get your choice of soup or salad and an authentic great tasting italian dish with a couple pieces of garlic bread! But yet, people still pack into the McBag for a number something or some plate lunch with box potatoes covered in jar gravy joint, and pay more for the digestible plastic than they would a tratt lunch. I just don't get it"}
{"text":"My Saturday lunch spot. The very best in town. Great friendly service!!  The food is to die for!  I promise it's all AMAZING!!  All of it!!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid Italian restaurant in downtown Concord. The food is flavorful. The decor is charming; I always love exposed brick. And the owner is very friendly and welcoming. If you find yourself in this small town, stop by. It is a refreshing  change from the plethora of chain restaurants in Concord.  There are also a few art galleries on the same street."}
{"text":"FOOD was awesome! We sat in pizza loft upstairs. Wait staff left much to be desired. Our kids ended up taking their drinks to the bar to get refills. I wanted another beer but know one ever came to ask. Our servers cigarette butt fell out on the floor by our table. My kids said they heard the staff using profane language. FOOD was good though."}
{"text":"Could have been a 4/5!

We had a reservation but it wasn't necessary when we got there but it filled up quickly. It was a 40 minute wait from setting down until we received our food which was very good but wait staff was short and service suffered because of it."}
{"text":"Gianni's was an outstanding, rustic Italian experience! The owner, Gianni, stoppped by basically every table in the place to have a quick chat. I think it is cool when an owner does that.

The food at this place is....incredible.

I had the Petti di Pollo Ripiena: chicken breast stuffed with three cheeses, wrapped in prosciutto - cooked to bacon perfection, covered in a creamy pesto sauce, over garlic mashed potatoes. &^%#! Delicious!

A collared shirt in this place is a must."}
{"text":"I was in town for business  and my hostess recommended this restaurant for dinner. Gianni's had excellent food and personable and efficient service. Five stars."}
{"text":"Eating out with food allergies is never easy. Many of our PAK members have eaten here and they love it. They have stated that the restaurant is nut free, very accommodating with other food concerns and they even have a nut free pesto."}
{"text":"Location, atmosphere and food are great.  The hostess and server were very friendly, but it took over an hour to receive our food after we ordered."}
{"text":"16 Union ST Concord NC.,, I will drive there for a meal any time I am within 100 miles of Gianni's.  The Caesar salad is perfection.  Mark our waiter was excellent, helpful  I have been there 3 times now, each time the food was delicious, I had 
Melanzane Ripeino
Delicate fried eggplant rolls slathered w/ herbed fresh ricotta & stuffed w/ a sundried tomato pesto spaghetti, baked in our home made marinara sauce topped w/ fresh wet mozzarella. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food as always.Large portions at dinner about half portions at lunch,just the right size.A busy place at lunch and dinner but there IS a reason for that."}
{"text":"Good gracious! The mushroom toast points were so delicious--I wanted to jump in that platter and lap up the sauce! I had a red fish dish with jalapeño cilantro sauce--unbelievably delicious. I've eaten in lots of NYC restaurants and this one tops them all. Waitress was spot-on with recommendations. Service fabulous and quite speedy. Atmosphere was perfect. This is a hidden gem in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Myself and Jeffrey tried this cute little place out last week.  Outside, the place looks a bit run down.  Inside, it's a romantic little gem.  However, the staff are less than charming.  The food is distasteful.  I'm not the type to go to an Olive Garden, but to be honest, Olive Garden has it beat.  The staff, manager and owner seem like mafia henchmen."}
{"text":"The pork with Marsala wine sauce (daily special) was a hit with my husband.  I had the gnocchi recommended by our waiter, and it was fabulous.  Definitely worth the extra for the meatball he recommended.  I was surprised that a dinner salad did not accompany the meal given the price of our entrees.  The window seat was sweet, as we were able to watch the world go by as we ate.  Next time we will plan some extra time to have dessert -- ice cream at the creamery across the street."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Gianni's. I absolutely love it! For me the food is orgasmic!"}
{"text":"Finally, I don't have to drive Into south charlotte for a really good restaurant.  Atmosphere is great , the food is better.  This will be one of my new favorite spots for dinner."}
{"text":"I couldn't let this go by without commenting. I don't know why people continue to go here. Dinner Friday night with friends. 7pm reservations. It took us an hour and a half to get our entrees. We got the bread and wine and salads, and then it's like the entire kitchen staff just quit. Not a peep from the waitress, manager, hostess- no one. In fact, we noticed at about 8:30 that out of the 9 tables of customers in the restaurant, nobody had any food. So we sat there and waited and waited. You would think if there was a problem, someone would have said something or comped us a dessert or drinks; nothing. Lousy customer service. Never going back. If I'm going to pay that much money for dinner (table bill was around $300), I expect comparable service."}
{"text":"Food is always outstanding! Great standard Italian fare mixed with unique dishes always cooked perfectly! Wait staff is always friendly and helpful. Hard to beat the spaghetti and lasagna!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here several times a year.  I like to come here for lunch when I am working downtown Concord because they have a large lunch menu at very reasonable prices.  Their dinner menu is a little more pricey with items ranging from $15 - $35 per entrée.    

Every other time I have been here for dinner the food has always been great.  However, last night when we went I was rather disappointed.  I ordered a bowl and my husband a cup of the French onion soup.  The soup was luke warm at best, the cheese barely melted and there were maybe 5 small croutons.  Possibly my expectations were too high, but when I think of French onion soup, I think of bubbling hot soup with melted cheese draping over the side of the bowl covering a large crusty piece of bread .   This in no way resembled what I had envisioned.  We waited for nearly five minutes for \"someone\" to come to our table so we could ask for it to be warmed up.  They graciously took our bowls and brought us two new bowls.  It was definitely warmer than it was previously, but not hot by any means and still not what I was expecting.  My husband ordered the ravioli special, and I ordered the insalata special.  The ravioli was great.  My salad however was drowning in vinaigrette and did not in any way look or taste like what the menu described.  

On a larger side note - when I went to the bathroom, there was an inch of dust on the crevices of the wooden bathroom stalls as well as on the toilet paper holder.  There were paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor, the sink was filthy and there were no clean paper towels to be had.  I know it was a Friday night and they were busy, but after seeing that, it only made me wonder what the kitchen looked like....and for a nearly $80 meal I just tend to expect more!

Very disappointed this go round and will definitely have to reconsider whether we will go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Really yummy! 

Salad- really good & ranch dressing was good

Cheese pizza- x cheese was that indeed - maybe next time I'll order regular cheese

For my next visit..
The waitress said the pasta sauces are made from scratch. If I come again, I really want to try the fettuccini Alfredo."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but not as good as it used to be. The service has definitely gone downhill as well but still a good place. It used to be a 5."}
{"text":"We took a friend here for a farewell lunch.  It was the first time for all of us.  The waitress was very attentive and did not allow my iced tea glass to become empty. The restaurant was able to accommodate our friend's desire for vegetarian. She seemed to enjoy her meal. I had the daily lunch special pasta with chicken. It was tasty, but the presentation was merely okay. My wife had a soup and half-sandwich.  The portions and prices were just right.  I would recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"Ok, we just got done with my daughters last meal before she heads off to college. The meal was out of this world. The atmosphere is spectacular, the only problem we had was the service was extremely slow. On the defense of the staff they did get swamped while we were there, but the food made up for it all. Great job and keep it up!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time today. Tasty lunch of the 'Confused Reuben' which has traditional pastrami, but adds in roasted turkey. Swiss is there, which is also standard; and of course, sauerkraut and Russian dressing. It was pressed in a panini press which crisped the bread up nicely (Jewish rye).

I chose the sweet potato fries as a side, and they came sprinkled with cinnamon. Tasty, even with the ranch!

It was just filling enough that I didn't feel over full; a feeling I get just about anywhere I go. I even had room to try the cannoli, a favorite of mine. Could have used more chocolate chips, but hey that's a personal preference!

Oh, best thing. They were able to accommodate my mobility scooter with no notice. Place seemed like it might have tight corners, and on the way out, the door had a lip on the bottom that meant I had to force the scooter over. It wasn't a problem getting in. If I were to go at night, I'd call ahead to make sure there was room for me!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the portion size was very small. $20 pasta plate that would satisfy my 3 year old."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner. The pan roasted scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly in a delicious cream. The pasta was excellent as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Surprised to find such a well done Italian menu in the middle of Concord, NC. Coming from NJ, this is the best I've had since moving here a year ago. 

Enjoyed the garlic knots to start with olive oil and balsamic while waiting for our Calamari Fritti. Was golden, delicious, crunchy served with a nice Diavolo sauce

For Entrees I enjoyed the Cavatelli with hot sausage, I love spicy food. Which was tossed in a spicy red sauce with onions, grated cheese, served piping hot. 

My girlfriend had the Chicken and Shrimp Picatta, which was perfectly seasoned chicken breast and Shrimp large enough to give Bubba Gump a run for their money. Side of Angel hair and what I believe was sauteed kale. 

Finished off with a 4 layer chocolate cake that should be named death by chocolate. 

They were understaffed tonight but that didn't deter from a great meal at a great location."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!  We went here on a whim and I'm enamored with them already. The owner came by and said hello, but more important, the food was outstanding and well worth the price paid. We tried two pasta dishes and were impressed with both of them. I'm looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times when chosen by others, not me. 
I don't understand why people go crazy over this place.
Overpriced microwaved food that takes forever to get to your table.
That is after you've waited almost forever to have your order taken.
Service has always been bad. Really bad. The girls don't wait on you like most places... You'd be lucky if they come to your table 2-3 times... But they sure will stand there with their hands out wanting that tip!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I waited so long to rate this place.

If you want legitimate italian, this is your place.  The lasagna is fantastic, the pizza from upstairs is great, the Caesar is flavorful, the seafood tagliatele is by far the best I've ever had.  A very well traveled co-worker who is very particular said the fish he had was the best hed ever tasted.

But hands down, the best thing I had here was the Veal Parm.  It's bone-in, butterflied, and as tender as it can be.   I've had it 5 or 6 times, and each time was amazing.

Don't think you can go wrong.  Great date night place, and the lunch specials are very affordable.

The Pasta Fagioli is great by the way."}
{"text":"We went to Gianni's tonight and had the red snapper and the Branzino. Both fish entrees were perfectly cooked.  The Red Snapper was a very large portion that was set on a bed of orzo and sautéed kale. It was topped with a wonderful roasted red pepper relish. The Branzino was a generous portion and set on a bed of saffron couscous and sautéed kale topped with a succotash relish. Although we ordered appetizers the main entree was very generous and was not needed. My only complaint is that there is tad too much salt added to both entrees.  We had the salted Carmel cheesecake recommended by our server Mark and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Yum!
Excellent food ad service!
We had an early supper after attending a play at the Old Courthouse Theater. It mad for a perfect day."}
{"text":"I'm writing this post as I sit inside this restaurant that refused to remake a dish bc it was too salty. When asked why they wouldn't remake it the manager, Val came out and said the dish was $40 and bc my girlfriend (who's African American) sent her soup back (saying she would pay for it) but did not like it the manager Val said \"You might have a salt sensitivity and if you told us we could accommodate you but we aren't remaking it.\" He then he walked away. When I and my other girlfriend asked to speak to the manager again thinking he misunderstood our request. He came back again and did not change his position. My girlfriend had her birthday dinner here on Sunday and when someone at the table had an issue with their dish it was promptly taken care of. Val not only made my friends and I feel horrible but he obliviously thought/assumes errorously that my friend couldn't pay for her meal/bill. The positive experience on Sunday is the reason we came back to try the full menu. Mind you, we are from Charlotte. 

After seeing/experiencing this horrible display of customer service or lack there of we won't be back and I will tell everyone not to either unless they are white."}
{"text":"Been here several times and generally have always been pleased with my food and service (one meal was less memorable). The anti pasta platter is a must for anyone going to Gianni's, a meal in itself with grilled veggies and assorted meats and cheeses.  The gnocchi is always a great option here.

{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever! I love going here I have never had a bad experience or bad food. If I could afford to come weekly I would!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and just ordered pizza. They were understaffed so slow service although they were extremely friendly! Pizza was pretty good but wasn't best I've ever had. Love the atmosphere! Definitely will go back for dinner and try their pasta!"}
{"text":"Delicous.  A tad overpriced.  Authentic, though, and recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Great place for everyone.  The downstairs has a more formal dining atmosphere while the upstairs is a laid back pizza joint.  Nice place for a family with kids.  Mom and dad wine and dine downstairs and the kids eat upstairs.   The owner always seems to be around and treats everyone as if they are a long awaited friend.   He does this tactfully as well.  He can sense if you want to be chatty or would just rather be left alone and acts accordingly with a permanent smile.    I'm more of a pizza joint kind of guy and I highly recommend the Stromboli.  It's the best anywhere."}
{"text":"Pretentious and overpriced. The pasta was over cooked and the bill was close to $100 for two people and one adult beverage - really??  in downtown Concord??  I could have driven to Chima's downtown for that kind of money and would have been able to eat at a normal size table instead of the pizza pan you call a table, and enjoy a meal that was truly memorable. Don't be lazy if you live in Concord.  Actually drive to Charlotte and go to restaurant that really IS five star.  If you must go, get an appetizer and hit the door after that."}
{"text":"Yummy!  This restaurant is super cute!  The waitress was attentive and helpful.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  I especially liked the Buffalo chicken pizza.  We'll be back for certain!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, more casual. Food was just gross (we ordered sandwiches and one pasta dish). Not worth the expense of a full service meal. Service was slow even though they had two servers and the place was empty. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Good food in downtown.  One of the few places to get a sea scallop around here. Wish they would pair them with some pasta in a dish! Only downside is the people walking thru the formal dining room  to get pizza from their informal take out area in the back."}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff. Satisfying food. If you can't find something you want to drink at their bar, you might not be trying hard enough. Good date spot."}
{"text":"Minister's recommendation was dead on.

Several weeks ago, I asked our Senior Minister who lives in Concord for a recommendation for  lunch in Concord. She recommended two, both on Union Street in the Historic Downtown Area.
I had dined at one of the two many times going back to when I worked in Concord but had never tried Gianni's till today.

We drove over and ran some errands on the way and got there about 12:30.  My wife and I walked in and immediately impressed with the decor. Beautiful and very inviting. Particularly striking was the Bar with Dark Wood and Mirrors was a work of art.

We were immediately seated and presented menu's.  From start to finish, service was impeccable.

Very interesting eclectic menu with many innovating takes of both Italian and traditional American Dishes. It proved hard to narrow down our choices since there was so much we wanted to try.

My wife ordered the Open Face Braised Pot Roast but asked them to leave off the bread. Best way to describe would be a Veal Marsala with Beef instead of Veal with a Mushroom reduction with Fontina Cheese and Fried Onion Petals on Top. For her side, she ordered the Fruit.

Did not try it but she proclaimed it to be the best Pot Roast she had ever had. Her description not mine. The fruit was interesting because this time of year, most servings of fruit are little else than melon. This one had a good selection of various other fruits as well.

I had the Don Giovanni which is a breaded Chicken Cutlet on Ciabatta Bread topped with bruschetta.  Great taste and texture. Almost tasted like a Caprese Salad on Chicken. Very good and an interesting combination.

For my side I had a Baked Potato Salad which is a basic Potato Salad but using Baked as opposed to boiled potatoes.  Different taste and texture from the norm and very good.

I'm gong to have to thank Sally tomorrow at Church.  If you can't trust the recommendation of a Minister, who can you trust."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. The servers are rude and incompetent. We waited what felt forever to be sited. Once when we're sited we waited 10 minutes to be helped by this rude women with long black ponytail. We placed an order and when the food finally made it to the table it was cold and not what we ordered. She never came back to check on our table except to bring us our check that was over charged. She was charging for things we didn't get. She never came back to pick up the check so we had to go to the bar to pay. She seem upset when we pointed out that she had over charged us. 
 Overall this was a very poor experience and we are not coming back."}
{"text":"Cooking just like back home in Brooklyn, NY!!! Awesome food in a great atmosphere. Owner Gianni is fantastic. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time on a Monday, had to come back on Wed. It was that good!! The ambiance, the waitstaff.....everything was wonderful. The lunch menu is amazing, the prices are hard to beat, less than $8 for a salad, pasta, and garlic knots. My only complaint is the salad dressing wasnt great, the first time I went I got ranch and it tasted like kraft ewww, the second time I got balsamic and it was just ok. The pasta was the star, perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection, the first time I had the Rocco it has meatballs and italian sausage in the pasta, they didnt skimp on the meat and the sauce was divine! The second time I got the pasta with chicken, broccoli (was supposed to be broccoli rabe but they were out), and sundried tomatoes. The chicken was juicy and tender, again it was well seasoned and just perfect. I may have to go back today, writing this has made me want some more!!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest little restaurant, tucked away in the historic downtown district. The white linen area downstairs was packed, but they have their more casual pizza loft that also serves as a great overflow area.

We made a custom pizza, and it was great. The crust was thin, but not too crunchy. Just right. It was remarkably good, and the service was second to none. The chocolate cake was nothing short of decadent. You've got to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Gianni's Trattoria is a totally underrated restaurant on Union St in downtown Concord. Gianni's dinner menu is rather expensive, and as such, I think it may sometimes be overlooked for lunch. But Gianni's lunch offerings are fabulous and affordable, and the wait staff is very efficient--perfect for a work lunch. 

Every dish I have ordered at Gianni's, from sandwiches, to pasta, to pizza, has been absolutely scrumptious! Even the side salad served with some meals, dressed with a tangy balsamic vinaigrette, is memorable and delicious.

Gianni's pizza is made New York style, with a thin crust dusted with flour, a just sweet enough sauce, and the perfect amount of cheese. The pizza comes in several iterations, including white pizza, or you can create your own. At lunch, pizza is serves by the slice, and for $2.50 you can get a slice and a drink, which is a quick and easy meal. The slices are quite big, so one or two slices is perfect for lunchtime. The pizza place (\"Gianni's Pizza) is actually upstairs, and you can order pizza for take-out.

Besides pizza, the lunch menu includes pasta, soups and sandwiches. The eggplant rollatini is a personal favorite--thinly sliced eggplant, breaded and lightly fried, rolled cylindrically and stuffed with delicate pesto-laced angel hair pasta, drizzled with marinara and fresh mozzarella. The dish is sumptuous, but still light enough for lunch (if you skip the garlic knots they put on the plate!). Their sandwiches are equally brilliant. La Verdura resets the bar for veggie sandwiches, with its incredible rendition made with squash, zucchini, eggplant, fresh mozzarella and pesto aioli. 

If Gianni's is not one of your lunch time stops, make sure to add it to your list! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in on Monday night for a business dinner and it was very quiet. Nice ambiance and very comfortable. We were greeted warmly by our server who told us some of his favorites. He knew the menu and his recommendations turned out to be spot on. All dishes were fantastic. I had a pasta with a cream sauce with shrimp and scallops and it was delicious. The portions are huge and the wine list is priced competitively. Service was fantastic. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm sorta surprised by the lack of reviews for this place.  We looked all over Kannapolis and Concord for a place to eat on Sunday.  According to Yelp, this place was closed but we walked in and they were open.  

We were basically the only people there, which concerned me.  Servers were very welcoming though.  

We got an eggplant pasta that was frickin delicious.  I'm not really a pasta expert, but it tasted like fresh pasta, rather than dried.  And the sauce was fantastic.  I was totally blown away, because I had prepared myself for some pretty average food.  

They were also very accommodating with our two kids.  They brought us a half serving of a pasta with tomato sauce that wasn't on the menu, which was perfect.

Also, very cool ambiance.  Really nice space.

I'm anxious to try this place again at night and also heard they have a pizza loft upstairs that I've heard good things about."}
{"text":"Gianni's was a great pop in for lunch last week! My wife joined me for a rare lunch date at this downtown Concord eatery. It's within walking distance of tons of neat little shops downtown. Also, if you find yourself n the lovely position of serving on jury duty, you can swing by Gianni's to unwind.  

The setup inside was really neat with some unique local art on the walls. Although it was a midday lunch break from work, I felt like I could really relaxing and enjoy myself in this atmosphere. 

I had the Confused Reuben with a side of sweet potato fries. I loved the Reuben because it had a hint of horseradish, which I had never tasted in a Reuben. Very nice touch on a staple sandwich! 

Food came quick and allowed me plenty of time to eat and get back to work. 

Thanks for the great visit!"}
{"text":"OMG.... I have eaten here alot, live the fun. I now have my first complaint. Had family come in this weekend and went there on Sunday night for dinner.. WTF. What a crap menu why would you not offer the menu. Nothen but cici's style crap."}
{"text":"Giannis is just wonderful. The staff are all incredibly nice and attentive. The food is always incredible. I have had many dishes from Giannis and have never been disappointed. I think my favorite has to be the lasagna though, a classic dish that tastes like your Italian grandmother from Italy made it herself! They also have the pizza loft upstairs, definitely very casual and a perfect weeknight dinner or lunch. The pizza is hand made and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, I absolutely love this place. Owner is an awesome guy, held my dads 50th bday upstairs a few years back. Food is always delicious from their chef from CIA!"}
{"text":"I came here as a promise to a waitress that worked here at the time. She came into my work place for help. We started talking and she told me if I was homesick for real authentic NY Pizza come to Gianni's Pizza Kitchen upstairs. 
     After work I  asked the bartender about getting pizza. I was directed thru a entryway and I  climbed the stairs. It was a rustic brick exposed well. At the top was a continuation of the rustic exposed brick charm. There was Emilee the smiling and happy waitress that invited me. She was thrilled I showed up. 
     Emilee introduced me to Gianni, he was such a nice guy. He brought all the best from his native N.Y.  He was friendly, easy to talk to, gracious and funny. Gianni and his staff made me feel like I was back in N.Y. just hanging out.
     I haven't got to the reason for my visit, the pizza. That's because I wanted to relive the experience of every bite. OMGosh, it was \"fantasmagoric (my word for so damn good)\".  I had the chicken pizza, he puts the chicken from his chicken parmesan on the pizza. Yes and yes! A half and half, which is now know as an Arnold Palmer. Was so refreshing good and perfect. I had no complaints. My go to for real pizza.
     Gastronomic experience at it's best."}
{"text":"Great little Italian in Concord. They even deliver!! Their cheese pizza is simple and delicious. Their spaghetti sauce is legit and would make your grandma proud. Im obsessed with their cannolis and as a true Italian I can confirm they are the real deal!"}
{"text":"Gianni's is a surprise to me since it sits in Concord but the Owner is super friendly , food is really good and the blueberry martini is one of the best I've ever had. 
Our waitress Bev is as  cool as they come and the atmosphere is nice , always busy."}
{"text":"The host at the restaurant is a delight she is wonderful, however that's the only good thing I can say about this restaurant. The wait staff  took forever our food came cold and on top of that we didn't get what we ordered. It's sad this place has a lot potential but they need to change their staff. Not coming back again and I don't recommend it! 

(We are at the pizza place on the second floor)"}
{"text":"Italian and European Food at its finest. Chef Heather Stadler knows her stuff."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. There was 4 people in our party. We all ordered something different. Pasta, pizza and sandwiches were all amazing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat in downtown Concord that had good quality food then this is the spot. The portions are large but if you want to share be prepared for a $5 split fee. The bruschetta was delish and the tilapia was amazing. The only disappointment was the onion soup. Service was good and atmosphere was charming. Great date night place."}
{"text":"Love the food but when I tried to make reservations another time was treated very rude and seemed like she didn't care if we came so I thanked her and hung up!!!"}
{"text":"Gianni's is a hidden gem in downtown Concord.  The pizza is delicious with a crust that is thin but not too crispy. The calzones are heavenly, filled with amazingly fluffy clouds of sweet ricotta. The sauce is really tasty too, with just a bit of a kick to it.  The pastas and salads are good too, but the Pizza Loft is where it's at. Finish off your meal across the street at the Cabarrus Creamery for dessert."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold and chewy
Waitress spilled cheese son table and just left it
Finally got s refill on drink as we were walking out the door 
Just not impressed"}
{"text":"Met here with a group of friends after a funeral. A sad occasion, but the friendly staff here was so accommodating it made it pleasant.

I expected an Italian restaurant in Concord to be mediocre at best. I was totally wrong, this place is awesome!

Wonderful fresh food. My friends raved about the meatballs. I had a salad with shrimp it was crisp fresh and delicious. 

Highly recommend this Gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Barely made 4 stars. Nice to have a place that takes reservations n Concord. Loved the calamari but wimped out with plain red sauce rather than fra diavlo. Shells with sausage was great but the broccoli raab just got in the way. Lasagna is traditional and good. Will be back!  Big portions FYI."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with Gianni's. I've been a handful of times and never had an issue with service or food. However, the last time I went for Mother's Day brunch left a sour taste in my mouth. Gianni's Mother's Day brunch is a deal for food but if you purchase alcohol you are in for an expensive surprise. My mother and I took advantage of the Mother's Day brunch package (I believe it was $24.99 per person) which did not include mimosas (unlike most restaurants). Of course my mother and I ordered mimosas expecting they were on special (again, like most restaurants offer on Mother's Day) but were blindsided when we received the bill. For each mimosa, Gianni's charged us $9.99 a pop totaling our bill to $120! 6 SMALL mimosas with cheap champagne completely doubled our Mother's Day brunch bill. Of course I take partial responsibility for not asking the waitress how much mimosas were but come on! Charging $10 a mimosa when you're using cheap champagne and using champagne flute size glasses is highway robbery. We haven't been back since."}
{"text":"This cozy Italian restaurant is conveniently located in downtown Concord. They offer a pizzeria that is separated upstairs from the main restaurant. The menu is very eclectic and offers a nice variety of food items, to include gluten free pasta. This visit was my first and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Was able to split two dishes that were both excellent!  My only complaint is that it took an extremely long time for the meal to be served after it was ordered. Thankfully we were not in a hurry and understood all items were prepared as ordered. Will return to this establishment for certain."}
{"text":"I was traveling to town for business and stumbled upon this Italian gem! We had a party of six so we called for a reservation at 7pm on a Thursday night, highly recommend as the place was pretty busy. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is authentic Italian/vineyard feel. The tables are set close together for a cozy feel with some lovely exposed brick on the walls. While our party didn't visit the bar, it did look well stocked and nicely laid out. 

For dinner our waitress was very helpful to all of us in talking through suggestions if we requested help. Pre dinner the table received these amazing garlic knots instead of plain italian bread... Def get your gluten on with these, they were awesome! For dinner I opted to split a chopped salad with another guest which was a great idea as it was a proper pre dinner salad size. Then for dinner I went with the Saltimbocca di Turchia Marinated tender Turkey Medallions pan seared & topped with sliced Prosciutto and Fontina Cheese, served with Garlic Roasted Mashed Potatoes and smothered in a Sundried Tomato Sage Garlic Butter, I wanted to lick my plate clean it was so good! 

Unfortunately we didn't save room for any dessert... next time I'm in town I will check that menu out!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. They have a great dinner menu. But we also tried it for lunch and it was amazing and very cheap. My husband had the special pizza and if had veggies, eggplant and bacons on it. The crust was crunchy and baked perfectly. I got the pasta that was on special and it was so yummy. The soup and salad both were great. You must try this place. Worths the time and money."}
{"text":"Stayed in Concord for one night to attend a concert and were looking for someplace to eat dinner before that wasn't a chain. From the pictures on line thought this would be a typical mediocre Italian restaurant but were very pleasantly surprised! Driving past all the raceways we weren't expecting a cute little Main Street with an intimate restaurant. We were there at 5 thinking we wouldn't need a reservation even tho it was Fri night but they had to work us in. We consider ourselves foodies and were impressed with the food--antipasto had fresh artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes I'm pretty sure were made from scratch. My husband loved his turkey saltimbocca and I really enjoyed my salad with grilled chicken. Service was very friendly and efficient. Liked the atmosphere! Would definitely go back if we are in the area to try some of the other things on he menu!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch here! I love that they do lunch specials...any pasta & salad for $7.99. Authentic, delicious italian food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on a pleasant street in Downtown Concord near other stores. It has a clean, rustic decor with a mixture of trattoria, country, and industrial design features. Our server was pleasant and willing to chat with us. The owner was on the location and visited another table, but not hours.

Our lunches were tasty and affordable. I had pasta alla vodka and my wife had a Reuben with southern potato salad. We will return for dinner next time we are in town in order to sample a larger menu."}
{"text":"The staff and food are great! It's right on the Main Street downtown and has perfect atmosphere"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place right in downtown Concord - something that is tough to find (both Italian and restaurant), as it seems like on certain days, the whole town shuts up tight. Pleasant surprise that they were both open, and the service and the food were nicely done.

If you're not in the area, I'm not sure if it's worth the drive all the way there, but if you're looking for something and you're in Concord, it's definitely worth a visit, as they have a nice atmosphere. Going to have to check out this pizza loft that I hear about the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best traditional Italian restaurant I know of-authentic is the key word here. The quality of ingredients and chef's creativity are what keep me coming back-and the versatility of the restaurant is something to be applauded. Want fine dining? This is the place. Looking for the best pizza in town and a glass of wine? Go upstairs to the pizza loft. Best of both worlds and nestled right in the heart of downtown Concord."}
{"text":"The food was nothing spectacular when I visited and the portions were very, very small for the price. I ordered shrimp and scallop linguini and it arrived with 3 shrimp and 1 lone scallop; my girlfriend's ravioli was average. Ordered a cannoli to-go for dessert, but it was VERY crunchy and not that enjoyable. The service was friendly, but the food was very slow despite the restaurant not being very busy. Overall I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Man. This was a tasty meal. Great service and ambiance. We had the pizza and it was on point."}
{"text":"WOW, what an experience. My friend and I went here and because we are from out of town we decided to go some place new. This food is amaaazing!!!!!!! The Alfredo sauce , is  Mouthwatering good. The shrimp and scallops that were in my dish were cooked to perfection. This is an absolute must go place if you are looking for authentic Italian food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to The Pizza Loft at Gianni's and was amazed at the lack of professionalism on display. As soon as we walked in there was no greeting due to the hostess not being behind the hostess stand and we waited for 10 minutes. As we made our way upstairs to the Pizza Loft we were instructed to find a seat and then proceeded to wait on a server.

The one server was working both the upstairs pizza loft and busing tables for the downstairs establishment: Gianni's Trattoria, which was packed. This explains the extremely poor service.

After 15 mins of non-service, and being passed over,  we decided to walk out and find another establishment for pizza. Decided to try Johnny Brusco's at 9900 Poplar Tent Rd and it was a night and day experience. At Johnny Brusco's we were immediately approached by the hostess who quickly sat us. T waitress was at the table within a minute despite the restaurant being a full capacity (about 65 patrons). 

Ordered the fried ravioli as an appetizers and as most know: fried anything is awesome. We then ordered the Four Cheese Pizza and it was delivered to our table in about 10 minutes. The pizza was spectacular and the more extensive menu looked impressive compared to that of The Loft at Gianni's.. 

I would not suggest The Pizza Loft as a place to sit down and eat pizza. I'd go with calling in your order and picking up yourself. That way you won't endure the terrible service. I would suggest that the owner(s) hire more experience waiters who know how to serve clients and maybe a few bus boys so the waitresses can concentrate on first time clients that need to be impressed to ensure future visits."}
{"text":"Love the ricotta cavatelli with hot sausage. It is very spicy and amazing. It is an intimate spot, low lighting, great for date night. I would recommend a reservation, the wait can be long at times."}
{"text":"Very delicious food with a menu providing variety. Waited a pretty good while to be noticed and seated once we entered, but service was fantastic, a notch above, once we were at our table."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience here when we stopped in for a quick bite for lunch. We had a gift card and were excited to give this place a try.

I ordered the Insalata Mista salad (organic baby greens with shredded carrots, grape tomatoes and cucumbers, house balsamic vinaigrette) and added a scoop of the chicken salad. The portion size was great for lunch.  The chicken salad was awesome!  I wish I had added an extra scoop.  They do offer a chicken salad sandwich and I'm thinking I'll try that nex time. The house balsamic dressing was also on point.

My husband ordered the Confused Reuben sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. He said the sandwich was delicious.  We shared the sweet potato fries and they were the perfect size and crisp.

Service staff was friendly and worked quickly. We had a great experience and plan on returning!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were strolling through Concord and decided to stop  at a delicious creamery in the downtown area. Knowing we needed to grab some dinner also we inquired about the Italian place across the street from some concord natives. We were advised that the place upstairs is where we need to be called \"The Pizza Loft\". So we finished our cones and made our way across the street. The moment we walked in the door we were hit by the aroma of authentic Italian food! We told the waiter we were looking for the pizza loft, and we were led to a staircase and told to go up. Fortunately for us, it was near closing so we were the only people dinning at that time in the loft, so we received some special attention. We meet the owner Gianni whom was a pleasure to meet. Gianna spoke briefly with us and later returned  when our pies came out! OMG, this was some of best pizza ever. Gianna spoke passionately about his incredible sauce and low moisture crust. The ingredients tasted fresh and the crust had a slight crisp to it!  The experience was outstanding, but the personalization of chatting with Gianna made it that much better. Hubby and I will be returning to dine downstairs for pasta next time! We peeped a few plates on our way out the door! Lol..."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. I have been here twice and thoroughly enjoyed both visits. The sea bass is delicious and beautifully presented. The second time, I got the red snapper and it was equally wonderful. They also have a \"family\" night on Wednesdays with less expensive entrees, but you have to ask the waiter what the specials are."}
{"text":"This place is the best! If you want REAL Italian, you need to go here. We were seated in a timely manner even though it was packed. The hostess and wait stage were polite and upbeat. The owners came out and asked how everything was. We got the calamari and the bruschetta, both were executed to perfection.they serve unlimited  homemade bread knots with seasoned Olive oil and balsamic sauce. Food took a little bit long, but it is a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"We were really satisfied with this place. Absolutely delicious margherita pizza (probably one of the top 5 best I've ever had). My wife and I shared the pizza, and a large Caesar salad which was also really good. As much as I enjoyed the pizza and salad, someone else at our table ordered a pasta dish (some type of stuffed shell pasta) with spicy red sauce, and prosciutto. I took a bite and was immediately jealous. I'll get that next time, whatever it was. I think all around if you stick with anything that has their homemade red sauce, you will be happy. The best part is the service. We really had a wonderful server, that made the entire experience that much better."}
{"text":"I should have walked out when I was asked did I have reservations...no one inside and host was taking forever to determine where to sit us. Then when we sat down and looked at the wine list...I was like wow Olive Garden has a five star list compared to there's. Food was par at best. Diff would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Was skeptical because it was in Concord.  Boy was I surprised!  The salad, eggplant dish, and wine were amazing!  The salad was fresh with crispy romaine and delicious olives.  The eggplant dish was so unique...nothing like I've ever had before.  Wish i could have eaten it all!  And the Cab Sav from Sonoma County was excellent....can't remember the name tho.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Ate here for lunch.  Will definitely be back for dinner!!  We had the confused Reuben and the Italian stallion.  The potato salad was a great side."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to celebrate our birthdays here and it was the PERFECT spot! The decor was rustic, charming, cozy, and romantic.  The servers were friendly and made us feel welcomed and a part of the Gianni family.  Not only was the service and atmosphere perfect, but the food was absolutely AMAZING! The flavor combinations of the dishes danced in your mouth and the portions were just right (I even got to take some home). We also received complementary cannoli for our birthdays, which were delicious and the best cannoli that I've ever had (& I've eaten numerous cannoli in my life being that I'm Italian). To top off an already wonderful evening, Gianni himself came out to wish us a happy birthday and check in on how our food was. He was pleasant, charming, and definitely makes you want to come back! Overall, I would highly recommend Gianni's if you want delicious authentic Italian food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"A wonderful find in Concord, NC, highly recommend a reservation.
We were seated in the bar at a high top, only disappointment was it was loud.
We ordered shrimp francaise and a chicken picatta. The meal started off with garlic knots- not terribly garlicky at all, even tough to find the garlic. They came with balsamic and olive oil.
The shrimp francaise was an interesting dish, the shrimp were very good size and angel hair pasta with fried spinach. The sauce with the shrimp was a citrus beurre blanc, not over powering but not definitive.
The second was chicken picatta, a large portion of chicken, smallish side of angel hair and a green vegetable, possible kale. Sadly the picatta was not real lemony, only slightly.
The wait staff was wonderful, very attentive, the owner even made rounds of all the tables, very hospitable.
Would go back again when in town."}
{"text":"Yesterday a friend and I attempted to have dinner at this restaurant, however we unfortunately were never waited on or even acknowledged. We stood at the front door for almost 10 minutes, and finally when we decided to walk in and seat ourselves after walking past one of the restaurant staff, without even a hello. There was about 8 customers in the place, all sitting within 15 feet from us being waited on, and yet no one asked if we could be helped. We waited at a table for 15 minutes. I felt invisible, as if my presence was unwanted. As men of color it was not a good feeling to watch all the other patrons be waited on while we were ignored. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner at Gianni's on my first visit, definitely will not be my last. four of us went on a Saturday night, every table was full, glad we had a reservation. Started off with the antipasto tray appetizer, an amazing array of Italian meats, cheeses and marinated vegetables, highly recommend.  Had a cup of Pasta Fagioli soup, another keeper! The Culinary Institute trained chef puts her own spin on the soup, had an unexpected but nice taste of sage, looking forward to my next cup. For a main course I had the sliced duck breast with a Fig reduction sauce; again amazing flavor. I sampled the other three meals and all were delicious and varied, veal, sea bass and pasta.  Finished the meal with coffee and a shared cannoli because we were so stuffed, everything was amazing.  The staff was attentive and focused. Plan to take some time as the meals are prepared fresh for each order.

Gianni's Trattoria and the Pizza Loft are located in the same building but are 2 completely different restaurants, the Pizza Loft upstairs is a typical NY style pizza joint, no frills beer and pizza, have not sampled yet but plan to on my next visit."}
{"text":"Great little eatery, stashed right in the heart of downtown Concord.  If you blink you will miss it, but it is worth looking for.  From casual pizza and beer with dining friends to a more romantic setting.  This place is good food and a great atmosphere.  

The pizza could not be better!  You can taste the freshness and quality in every ingredient.  The service is complete and the server will make sure your glass is never empty.  With HD Televisions all around, every seat is a good seat.  

Shout out to the best server in Concord...  Emilee!   Upstairs at the Pizza Nook,  she will take great care of anyone who is fortunate enough to dine during her shift.  The owner, Gianni takes personal pride in his restaurant.  He knows how to make his guest feel welcomed and keep customers happy. He oversees the kitchen for continuity and optimal deliciousness.

Good menu, decadent desserts...  And the prices are more than fair.  
The parking is reasonable, depending on the date and time you arrive there.

I rarely give out five stars, but I can't think of one complaint, only raves.  The folks I went there with loved it too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but there was one glaring problem with the food. The sauce tasted like canned tomatoes, that awful metallic taste they have when they haven't been cooked long enough. The hallmark of good Italian cuisine hinges on their sauce, so this was a serious disappointment. Nice atmosphere and decor though."}
{"text":"Our first trip in February I would not leave a review because I loved my dish lasagne but, my husband was disappointed he had a braised lamb dish with pasta and there was very little lamb and it was just not worth the price ! But , today we discovered a family Sunday dinner with many delicious pasta dishes that are not on the regular menu and it was awesome ! The prices were very affordable and it came with salad ! It was truly like a Sunday dinner ! Our waiter was fantastic and went above and beyond to explain the dishes and even let us sample one of the sauces . We will go again now that we know about this !"}
{"text":"I would really give this a 3.5, but since that's not possible it's getting a 4. The food is delicious and always consistent l. Lunch is great here - there are several lunch combos and smaller servings of pasta that are delicious and you can get a very satisfying lunch for under $10. Make sure to ask about any specials, which are generally delicious and usually not similar to anything else on the menu. Slices of pizza from the pizza loft upstairs are available at lunch as well.

Dinner is a different story. It's almost like dining in a different restaurant. Don't get me wrong - the food is still great, but it really seems overpriced for what you're getting. There isn't much competition in the immediate area, but it still seems weirdly high.  Pizza is not available downstairs for dinner.

The wine list is generally good. There is a nice variety, at various price points, although more than once I've been told that a listed wine is not available, AFTER I have ordered it.

Service at both lunch and dinner is average to below average. It is really slow, and not in a \"we're just leaving you alone to enjoy your dinner and conversation\" way, but rather more of a \"sorry did no one take your drink order yet?\" way. Food generally comes out as requested, and no one is rude, but no one has ever paid particular attention to my party either. All that being said, it's still generally worth eating here, unless you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"For single guys like me who save a lot of time by NOT being ol we can use that opportunity to go out for dinner alone. They have very creative dishes, food taste fresh and very nice service."}
{"text":"I just finished my first meal at Gianni's and it was the most amazing meal ever! I live in NY and I am in town visiting a friend, I told him I didn't want any Italian food being I can get good Italian food anytime in NY. He told me that I absolutely had to try the Brooklyn style Broccoli and Maccaroni, that I would not regret it. I am so glad I agreed to go because everything was delicious, the service was great, despite us walking in 15 minutes before they closed, the pasta was amazing! I can't wait for my next trip to NC just so I can come back to Gianni's for the Brooklyn pasta!!"}
{"text":"Gianni's offers a great, nice meal at a rare local restaurant in downtown Concord. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal. The environment is very unique; it has a wonderful Italian feel! The quality of the food is great."}
{"text":"We ate a late dinner (9pm) Sat 3/13/2010....the restaurant was still fairly busy...we started with arugula salad with prosecco vinegarette for 3 of us and Aranici (beef/sausage, saffron and arborio rice balls in a red sauce)...all good...house white wine was fair (Kris Pinot Grigio)...for dinner, I had Duck Confit...excellent preparation and very generous portions...my older dtr had filet mignon with wild mushroom reduction, veg medley and potatoes, my wife had the scallop special over orchietti  with a cream sauce...very flavorful, my younger dtr had an eggplant dish that was amazing....service was prompt and friendly...we paid the $15 corkage (2004 Clos Rougeard Saumur-Champigny) and the stemware was fair/adequate...dessert was great cannoli .
Both the owner and the cook personally visited our (and others) table....\"real\" people, very friendly...overall very authentic and very classy place, highly recommended.. nice decor as well
Total bill ~$190 for 4"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are just amazing. The staff was friends and knowledgable. The place was packed but we got right in and never had to wait for service or food. You will not regret going here."}
{"text":"I have had treat good food here and 2 or 3 great visits however this last visit wad disappointing.  

 Since there were only two of us the gentleman suggested sitting near the entrance.  Little did we know every time the for opened we got a draft of really cold air.  

Service was really slow. Pour server said a few times she quill be back with bread but it took twenty- five minutes to get bread after we ordered.  

It took well over an hour to get food.  The large group next to us ordered before us and were still waiting when we were finishing our meal.  

I know they had several large groups but service was really slow.  I don't think I'll try it on a busy stray night again.  

God is good but not for the wait."}
{"text":"Best Italian in NC - without a doubt. They use local produce and high quality products straight from Italy. This place is the real deal and you get what you pay for - every single bite is worth it. 

I've eaten here countless times and never had a bad meal."}
