{"text":"Great value. Sushi is always fresh and delivery is prompt. Recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm in between a \"Eek, me thinks not\" and a \"Mehhhh\" on this one.

Service: They always checked up on us. Very nice people

Decor: Nothing I haven't seen before

Food: I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Lunch Gold Box which came with salad (Yummy but typical salad you find at sushi places), cucumber roll, california roll (pretty decent), shrimp and veggie tempura (perfectly made), dumpling (disgusting, i couldn't even finish 1), steamed rice and of course the chicken teriyaki (chicken was cooked well, however the sauce tasted like some cheap store bought sauce). 
It was suppose to come with crab tempura too, but they forgot that

My friend ordered the Pork Cutlet Gold Box. Basically she got everything mines came with except with Pork Cutlet. Her pork was super dry and the sauce it came tasted like a CHEAP store bought sauce. 


Price: Even though the food wasn't the greatest, the portion was huge, esp for $8.99. 


Would I come back here again? I really doubt it. Would I recommend it to anyone? Nope."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and the prices are reasonable. I'm a fan of the take-out option because you get 10% off if you pay with cash. I'd dock half a star because the last few times we were told our order would be ready in 20 minutes but it was closer to 40-45 minutes - might be the fact that it's gaining popularity in the neighbourhood, but I would still prefer a more realistic timeline."}
{"text":"Always take-out. Only purchase sashimi. Always fresh. Never ever any fishy smell or taste.  Attractively presented. If you order lots they throw in a fresh salad, soup...they are always polite & very grateful for your patronage. Pricing is comparable."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.. The food is Amazing..and the price point is also great too.....it looks a bit grungy inside but don't get it twisted the food is great."}
{"text":"Great value for it's pricing.  I used to go all the time for lunch when I worked in the area... I now live in New York and a find myself craving it."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look impressive on the outside, looked a bit dingy and unkept from the outside. We were the only ones in the restaurant so i was slightly skeptical, it was after the lunch hour special (at about 3/4 pm). However, the food was great and the staff was friendly. What i did find slightly unappealing was the sushi rice was a bit too soft (like the rice was cooked in too much water). However the nigiri was super fresh. 

TL;DR:

good service, food was good aside from the mush-ish rice, exterior does not reflect on quality of fish."}
{"text":"Love Miyako! we order from here regularly. They are super nice there and the food is delicious. Great affordable prices and quick delivery"}
{"text":"I was around the neighbourhood and decided to stop by...plenty of parking, okay place very casual.  Service okay but Sushi was superb!  Not only the taste, variety but the size was huge... I love it.  Next time I will just pick it up, not dinning in."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for quite some time and recommended by a few.  Most of the customers are non-Asian. It is the all you can eat Japanese restaurant.  For a week night, it is $18.99.  

The Miso soup tastes good but only warm and not hot enough.  Agedashi tofu is lightly batter but found to be bit sour, so we return it.  Shrimp Tempura also is lightly batter.  It is not oily, the shrimp is long but thin.  Gyoza is deep fried to be crispy.  The Salmon and White tuna sashimi is fresh and good.  The beef roll with sprout is much better than the other restaurants.  Udon is very hot and soup tasty.  You can order chicken, beef or seafood as the tops. Eggplant has too much sauce on it.  Edamame is a bowl portion and steamed hot.  Dragon roll is average.  Sushi is not packed enough and when you pick it up, it can easily split into 2.  The ice cream either Green Tea or Red bean is a large single scoop.  The fried banana is very delicious.

The waitress is attentive and polite.  Service is good.  Food is served in a timely manner.

Don't know whether it is due to the tofu, I got diarrhea at night."}
{"text":"Not a very good sushi experience. The prices are good, but the food is not the best. The shrimps in the dynamite roll are not fresh, and the smell is aweful. They must have used an old-old oil. Yukes.
The california and Jade was so-so, but Jade didn't have asparagus, so it was plain. Spicy tuna was fine.
Not coming again."}
{"text":"I am currently visiting Canada and I just came from this Restaurant a few hours ago. What i have to say is  WOW, I mean WOW this Sushi is some good stuff for the money, in this restaurant you will get the most bang for your buck- it comes with a 10 percent discount.

  I ordered a Japanese pizza roll, raw salmon, fried chicken and a sashimi combo.  And Most if not all tasted better than the sushi restaurants i frequently visit in NYC, I am from NYC. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now i will rate the restaurant on different criteria from 1-5 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleanliness-  The restaurant can be cleaner, but I did not expect much since i was hungry and looking for GOOD cheap Japanese food.  I saw a lot of salt on the floor possibly due to foot traffic from the outside to the inside.   While making the Sushi, I saw the master chef constantly cleaning his hands, that is a good and unexpected surprise.

Cleanliness 3.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customer Service- Much better than expected, The moment i walked in i was immediately greeted like a king and was served a menu and tea.  Again, this is not a 4 star restaurant and I did not expect much to begin with.

4.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bathroom- Clean and large.

4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Menu selection- Large, over 200 items can be ordered and all at a cheap price, much cheaper and tastier then in comparable NYC restaurants.

4.5 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taste- Obviously i did not try all the selections, but i did try one of the pizza Japanese roll ( i think thats what it was called), it is unique and i have never tried it before and the taste was superb.  The raw Salmon, was good with just the right texture and consistency.   The fried chicken wings was crunchy and not too oily.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being a visitor in Canada, my phone did not have a data connection, and to my surprise Miyako had one. It was a life saver as i was slightly lost in going back to the hotel. 

for being a life saver- 4.9




In summary- if your going for something delicious and cheap then this may be a Miyako may be a good place.  The place could be a bit more cleaner but the good and cheap food more than make up for the cleanliness quality.   Also the Free wifi is a definite plus.

Over all rating 4.3"}
{"text":"Amazing food for the price.
I'm a regular customer to this place. In my various time of dining I've come to accept a few things about this place.
1. The service can be slow specially when it's busy.
2. They might take a while to get your order OR sometimes be missed or forgotten.

But even with those things the place is still amazing! Once you get your order you'll forget those things. The stuff you get for the price they ask for is simply bonkers! 

Try the dynamite roll and ask for spicy mayo and dip it in. Delicious! Best bang for buck for sure is the lunch combo that they have from 11-3. 

Great place to try. They also do takeout."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in the area, especially for takeout. It's convenient and has great value for it's quality. I always make sure to stop by at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Owner was super nice, server was really helpful , always happy to help and has a smile on his face and also always around to cater my needs. Sushi was one of the best i ever had and the freshest i ever had. Not too pricey for a la carte sushi but it is worth it for the qualoty you get in return. I really reccomend the black dragon roll for $10.50, never had it before and im glad i had it when i went for the first time. Much better than the chain sushi restaraunts and Rainbow sushi nearby. Hope this helps. This is my first review and is honest."}
{"text":"I went with my brother and we both ordered sushi combo C along with a Miyako special roll.

The service was good. The portions were fantastic with a generous serving of miso soup and salad and large rolls. The sushi and rolls themselves were not that great. I felt like the rice was way too soggy.

The other times we went we ordered their bento boxes and udon. The experience was much better and a lot tastier. 

I wouldn't recommend their sushi and rolls, but I would recommend just about everything else."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for an all-you-can-eat. Service is spotty - sometimes friendly; often slow; better since they got written menus. When it's busy they can be really slow, but if you go during non-peak hours it's not a problem.
It's fine, but not amazing. We are regulars, but only because their prices for kids are really low!"}
{"text":"The first time we went to Miyako, we sat in for the Lover's Special at $31.99 which came with way more food than we could handle, with a good mix of sushi, tempura, rolls and a hearty scoop of ice cream at the end. Service was regular but the food came very fast (which was great because we had a huge appetite after a work out). 

The second time we got the 44-piece sushi and sashimi party tray for the two of us. For $32 and a10% discount for picking up and paying cash, it was a deal. This time the staff was extremely friendly. If you just want to pig out on sushi, sashimi and rolls, this party tray will do the trick. The rolls were pretty big and tasty, but the sashimi didn't seem very fresh. For the price I want expecting anything more really. 

I will return for a take out order because of the affordability. However I wouldn't go out of my way to dine in because the restaurant itself has nothing more to offer and with tips and taxes, it would make the food overpriced for its worth."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Miyako Sushi on a weekly basis for about 5 years and I must say that I have never ONCE had a negative experience here. The food is always top notch, very well priced, quickly made and the manager/staff are very friendly. Maintaining that level of quality is not easy in this industry so where credit is earned credit is due. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"A small neighborhood restaurant with good sushi, good service, owner is extremely friendly and courteous. Highly recommend the red dragon roll and the soft shell crab. I'm glad to have such a good sushi place nearby. It's my go-to take out :)"}
{"text":"Hygiene, hygiene and hygiene. The most import element when it comes to the quality of the food. I'll get to that in a sec. but first. 
Considering the neighbourhood and location, this place is nice. Please are so friendly that, the moment you walk in, they welcome you and good and stuff when you leave. Which is all dandy, but this isn't exactly why we go to a restaurant. I mean, not entirely. I think what matters the most is the food and how my food is treated, before serving me. I wasn't very impressed, when I noticed the sushi master's nails. They were almost the same size as my girlfriend. And i know, my girlfriend has a lot of trouble handling food. But regardless, I don't care you are a man or a woman, when you are handling others food - no matter how clean you are those nails ought to carry the nasty stuff. Please keep in mind that this is what I was noticing, while I was waiting for my take out to get ready. When my food was ready and good to go, I noticed the other chef, who is a heavy set guy with a baseball hat, drop something on the ground (they have cardboard floor). I couldn't careless, because I was too excited that wait is over and my food is ready. However, I couldn't help but notice the weird reaction of the chef with the ball cap. I stepped back and saw - there was a shrimp on the floor. He didn't notice that I seen it. In the meanwhile, server handed me the takeout bag and when I was about to step out, the ball cap check, picked that shrimp from the floor and threw it in the batter for tempura.
As far the food, can't say much cause I don't think am gonna eat that after seeing those nails. 
Peace!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for a long time and I am so glad to have this place! Ever since it turned into Miyako Sushi from Kokoro Sushi, I have been getting take-out at least twice a week. 
Pick up is %10 off! 

Their dragon rolls are fantastic! Giant pieces, hard to eat in one bite! Avacado salad is so worth the 3 or 4 bucks. Well priced sashimi and shrimp tempura. Awesome chicken/shrimp fried rice! Salmon pizza, grilled salmon, fresh fresh fresh!

The few things like grilled pork and lamb are not the best, but you get what you pay for. Still tasty.."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Value for money, delicious food, fresh tasting sushi and for me... around the corner.
Have been getting take aways from here for a couple of years now, have dined in as well. Haven't had an issue yet. Staff is friendly.
Some of the best sushi and sashimi that I've had in Toronto, always tastes fresh. Place offers bento box meals, but I haven't tried them. My goto meals include chicken teriyaki, sushi rolls (tuna, salmon, bbq eel, ebi), tempura platters, fried rice and udon noodles. They are all delicious and fresh. Would definitely recommend the place to anyone looking for a delicious Japanese meal. You wouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came in one night to order a take out order. Menu is extensive like any sushi place, pieces are fair. Place is quite small but opens up bigger in the back. Kitchen can be seen and looked clean. 

I ordered sushi with soup, it was great, as for the miso soup, but sure if It was left over Sunday soup where water was readded but the taste was off. I got the salmon combo, salmon was fresh, sushi was made good and not messy. Order came in quick, was pretty surprised with the place. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"I came here today for a night snack with some friends and was astounded by their great prices, especially for the massive portion size they give you! It's pretty authentic tasting sushi also, which i find important, and theres whole menu of options. From bento boxes to shishami and rolls! I especially loved the shrimp tempura, and classic California roll! They also some great combo deals to check out such as the bento box which comes with a side of rice, a 6pc California roll, a house salad and a miso soup, on top of you're choice of beef or chicken terriyaki for only $12.99 which is a meal that will surely fill you up!"}
{"text":"Pretty great food! Good amount for a good price.  Food is probs same quality as some downtown places but there is more for better prices. Atmosphere is kinda shady so eating in there isn't recommended but for take out and pickup it's great because you get 10% off when you use cash!"}
{"text":"Love Miyako, order from there atleast once a week. The owner does the delivery and he's so sweet! The girl that answers the phone usually can be rude. The prices are good and servings are good sizes."}
{"text":"stumbled upon this random shop recently. the sashimis are really quite fresh, and the maki rolls were massive. 

It was otherwise a good shop: two things didn't work out tho. It was Saturday and the shop was sooo dead, us being the only diners in there. also, the delivery door opens straight into the dining hall: a bit strange having someone heaving boxes into the room while eating. kind of a bad set-up, i think usually diners don't see the behind the scene kinda thing happening. 

Decent sushi, sit near the front"}
{"text":"Amazing service in fast and friendly environment. It was my second time coming in today and they got my takeout love boat tray A finished in less than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Okay this is an odd review; please stay with me.  

Never venture inside this restaurant. The temperature is uncomfortably warm.  The wallpaper and \"decor\" is cheap, faded and dusty.  There is a desk amidst the dining tables littered with pamphlets and plastic bags.

But four stars for sure.  The quality and value of the full menu sushi and sashimi offering is the best in Toronto.  So, given the setting, we order takeout... a lot.  For the same price, we get half the quantity and quality of other sushi places in the Yonge/Eglinton corridor.  Miyako is our go to, and they offer free delivery to a surprisingly large area or 10%off for pick up.

Rolls, tempura, sashimi are all great quality.  There are like 150+ items on the menu.  The miso soup is LOADED with tofu.

My wife won't venture inside (on my recommendation) in case it dispels her belief that this is a top three sushi restaurant in the city.  I am more adventurous and will enjoy a  Sapporo while I wait for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm truly torn on this review - the quality of the sushi they give, for the price, is amazing. I will continue to order takeout from here on a weekly basis because it's convenient and inexpensive. They also offer 10% when you pay cash. HOWEVER, the inside is not at all nice. It needs to be renovated and cleaned. It just seems like they don't have much pride in what their restaurant looks like, likely because most people who support this restaurant order takeout. On top of that, the woman who most frequently answers their phones is mostly uninterested in speaking to anyone and every time I call I feel like I'm imposing."}
{"text":"Slightly hidden on Marlee St. And Glencairn. 

Free parking available right in front of the store which is a perk. 

Reasonable priced for the quantity. 

I love ordering bento boxes. For the most part l, sushi places tend to do a teriyaki w tempura. However, this place has two items that are meat/chicken/fish options in your bento box. 

I choose the salmon and chicken teriyaki bento box. This comes with the rice, salad, miso soup and 6 California rolls. I was tempted on choosing the beef and eel bento box. So I will save that for next time. 

That being said it's pretty filling and definitely worth your money.  
The tea they serve seems to be lighter and more fragrant than most oriental places who provide complimentary tea. 

The decor is slightly dated but your here for the food. 
They are always busy prepping lots of take out food. 
Which is why I also order from this location when I'm craving sushi. 

Will I be back? Of course! :)

The reason for the 4 stars is due to the decor and the service a bit on the slow side. Possibly due to taking care of take out orders.

This place is also open until 11 on the weekends which is great."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for two years and have avoided this place because of it's very shabby appearance. After reading some positive Yelp reviews, I decided to give them a try today. 
Their menu is available on their website, which is very easy to google. They have a large selection of sushi/ sashimi rolls to choose from. 
I called and ordered a Rainbow Roll and a Dynamite Roll. My call went through quickly and the lady on the phone was polite.
In 15 minutes my order was ready as I had been told it would be. 
I received a %10 discount for paying in cash, so my total was about $17 after it had been applied. 
The sushi pieces are enormous! I could have just got one roll instead of two, but I was expecting standard size sushi. All of the ingredients were very fresh, and the sushi was overall enjoyable. 
The presentation was a little crammed as my container was over stuffed. When I lifted the container in my house, the weight cause the plastic to bend and I almost lost a couple pieces. The sushi was so packed that the piece of Rainbow Roll that was nest to the wasabi ended up covered in that bitter green paste. The generous serving of sauce on the Dynamite Rolls had leaked onto some of the Rainbows. 
Despite my minor complaints, I will definitely be back to try out other menu items- I'll just be getting one roll at a time, or asking them to be packaged separately to avoid receiving an overly full container!"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the decor (or the outside).  Decent sushi - at very fair prices.  Would likely use them for take out rather than eat in, but a nice find in an area that doesn't have a lot of sushi options."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and I've gone to this place quite a few times. 

Costumer service is very good, we are always greeted and looked after very well.  The food is quite inconsistent sometimes its really really amazing and other times not.  My guess is that they salvage all the meat they buy.  I don't think that this should be done especially when it's fish that they mostly deal with

Prices are very good especially considering how much food you get for you money

The place isn't a five star restaurant so the interior is adequate and clean. 

In conclusion:
Their food is very good most of the times.  It would definitely be all the time if they didn't use meat that is on the older side.  They should buy less meat and more ofter in order to remedy the inconsistency of the product they put out.

My opinion on sushi:

I try to eat sushi in the restaurant as the taste of the sushi suffers extremely if being delivered.  Sushi is not like pizza it should be eaten right away in order to get the best out of your meal."}
{"text":"I always order delivery or takeout. Reasonable price and good service. Large sushi rolls."}
