{"text":"We stopped here on a whim, and I'm so glad we did! The server was very nice and helpful, and the food was good and inexpensive. I ordered fried squash, and it tasted just like my grandmother's. All of the food looked homemade, including my son's corndog -- nothing appeared to be pre-breaded, pre-packaged, etc. A great place for good Southern cooking. Nice perk: dessert came with our meals. I highly recommend the apple cobbler."}
{"text":"BBQ was excellent. Service was good. I had the tray with fried okra and mac&cheese. Was not a fan of the mac and cheese it was very watery. The okra was great."}
{"text":"Just stopped here because we constantly pass JB's on our way to South Carolina. They have a nice home made taste to all their food, prices are very reasonable, and their BBQ is good! Fries were fresh and the hush puppies are awesome! Server was very friendly and we loved the calm atmosphere. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is probably the best local in the area and they serve a mean breakfast. They go a bit on the bland side on the spices for anything else. A perk, you can get bones for your dogs when they cook the pulled pork, my dogs love them."}
{"text":"To be fair I didn't get to eat here.  Attempted to visit on a Saturday for lunch.  The website stated that they were open from 6am-4pm.  Arrived to one sign stating that they were open and another sign stating that they were closed.  Closing at 12:00noon on a Saturday?  Really?  Sorry folks, you get a one 1 out of 5 for poor management.   Feel free to be open whenever you desire but please do keep your info up to date."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of  entering restaurants in my GPS and judging by name if I want to eat there.  It is something I do even if I am not going to stop.  I was driving on 74 East to the beach and JB's Midway Country Cafe came up on the screen..  I am so there.  I pull up and it is a sad little building, good sign!!!  It looks like their focus is BBQ, I had a veggie plate.  It looks all beige in the photos but I love it and they served hot hushpuppies and good sweet tea!!!!  Sweet tea makes the world go round."}
{"text":"To start the customer service is not that great! The place represents itself as a BBQ restaurant but is no where close to being authentic. The mac and cheese was soupy the pulled pork tasted like tomato paste.... this place needs a major revamp!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard to what you expect from a down home cooking restaurant.  Fast, friendly service.  Chopped pork was moist and flavorful.  Egg custard pie was a great addition.  Great prices and perfect portions."}
{"text":"I love good barbecue, and this is the place to find it in Monroe! Their BBQ sauce is great! I ordered the chopped BBQ plate with 2 sides, and I chose fried squash and mac n' cheese. The squash was so great...just the right amount of breading. The macaroni wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad either. I also got hushpuppies, which comes with the meal. They were great, too! I can't believe I've lived in Monroe for 5 years and have never been here before! I'll definitely be coming back to this place again soon!  Not only was the food good, but we also had great service! Our waitress was very sweet and kept up with us even with the lunch crowd. She apologized for letting our drinks get low, but they weren't even low long enough for me to notice! Good service and great, homemade food... What more could you want? :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you the food is Southern and perfectly prepared.  Went for our first time today and we're very pleased with the value and abundance that was on a plate.  We tried the chopped BBQ and sliced brisket both excellent.  The sides were just like grandma made. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Monday for a late lunch. Ordered the brisket sandwich platter and my friend the ribs platter. Ribs were days old and heated up. Brisket was drowned in sauce and very fatty. Side dishes of beans, fried squash,which was yellow squash, Mac n cheese and mashed were cold and/or greasy and cold.  Do not recommend additionally because the place is not very clean. Old wall unit air conditioner near table with filthy grill. Dirty floors. Tea served out of dirty pitchers. Waitress smoked out front and didn't wash her hands on returning to work.  I had a very disturbing experience while being served. A bumble bee came out of nowhere and stung me on the arm. Waitress killed it with disinfectant spray and then I picked it up and threw it in the trash. Just awful and bizarre. I think this alone might have been scary and painful but a tasty plate of BBQ would have helped me forget. Sadly it was some of the most poorly prepared food I've ever been served in a BBQ place.  I really should have judged the book by the cover at this place and I would have just kept on driving by."}
