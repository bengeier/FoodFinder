{"text":"Excellent thai restaurant. We had dinner for the first time there last night. The food was delicious. The only negative point is \"the bring your wine\", so they don't serve any alcohol. Not convenient for me since I like to have a beer and my husband doesn't drink. Besides that we really enjoyed our experience and might become regulars."}
{"text":"A very nice place indeed. I highly recommend it to anyone in the area. They have an Ã  la carte menu as well as all you can eat menu where you order what you want and it comes to you fresh on your table. 

The food is very good and fresh, some dishes are better than others but in general food is good. 
Generally speaking, our overall experience was very good. The service was good, the waiters were very helpful and nice, and the ambiance is nice and beautiful. It is a nice place to go with the family, kids, coworkers and friends. 

Visit it and you be the judge"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai spots in the city.

This little gem has great Thai Salads, curry, Tom Yum and much much more.

The Papaya salad was just wonderful. Had a perfect amount of spicy and a good vegetable mix.

The green curry was very very good, the pieces of chicken were so so, I found them to be too big and too chewy. Green curry was spicy but was expecting it to be more so. 

Overall a great experience and would recommend it for one of the best Thai spots."}
{"text":"Do you want to eat a lot, but don't want to get up to a buffet counter?

This place does Thai cuisine the right way, very flavorful without being overly spicy. Most people will opt for the AYCE menu, about $30-32 per person.
Their dishes are numbered 1-50, and you order on paper, it's much simpler than a sushi concept since it's very well divided. 

They prepare dishes as you order them so it's always fresh and hot as they bring them.
I liked the shrimp dishes more than the beef and chicken since it was pretty big pieces.

We finished off with a fried ice cream ball, the size of a baseball and coated in an intriguing batter.

The service is pretty quick and courteous and the decor lends itself to a celebratory vibe.

PS, the parking lot is more craters than actual asphalt, so beware."}
{"text":"This my 2nd time at Sawadika. The experience has been better than last time.
Beautiful restaurant, gorgeous decor, perfect and quick service and delicious food. 

We ordered food from tasting menu... believe me it was worth it. It's almost all you eat for 32$. The bring you 8 platters at a time. Every single dish was delicious to the T. Great appetizers, succulent main dishes and heavenly deserts. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The atmosphere was really good. I plan to add the 5th star once they add pat-Thai to the menu. We ordered the \"all you can eat\" sampler, and potions were served big enough for the 3 of us. 16 different dishes and not a single one had left overs at the end. We liked them all. Really, really good."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as always. Went with a group of 16 people for a work party. At first they had given us two separate tables which was a bit upsetting as we all wanted to sit together. However our waitress Kayla was super friendly and everything ended up working out in the end. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My fiance and I chose the all-you-can-eat menu (we got a deal off livingsocial).  

First off, the decor is breathtaking.  You can see pictures on their website.  

But that's where our awe with the restaurant ends.  Having just come back from Thailand, we were not impressed with their water-thin curry nor their lemongrass or basil dishes- which didn't taste like either, respectively.  We ordered several lemongrass and basil dishes and kept hoping... but couldn't taste the flavors!  
Although I found 4-5 leaves in the basil dish that if I chewed, I could verify was basil.

Their Thai food was really Chinese food, with basil and lemongrass added in the names.

That being said, for those who have NEVER been to Thailand to try authentic Thai dishes, the atmosphere of this restaurant will grant you a nice dining experience.

Finally, even with my living social deal ($20 for a $40 voucher to use towards buffet for 2), the final meal price came to about $25/person for the buffet menu.  Pretty pricey."}
{"text":"We've been here before many times and this time was no different than before. Everything was awesome! We chose to order from the tasting menu so we could try everything as usual. The appetizers are all great, but we had the shrimp imperial rolls, chicken skewers, and pan fried dumplings. All three were delicious! Next we had the rainbow shrimp, general tao, crispy garlic shrimp, basil chicken, chicken with pepper sauce and Thai crispy noodles. All of those dishes were superb! The service here is great. The waitstaff are so attentive and friendly. The manager is so caring and thoughtful. We will always come here."}
{"text":"I ordered the salt and pepper calamari, red curry -vegetables with fried bananas. Everything was delicious and good portioned. Beautiful ambiance and great staff."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai restaurant in Montreal. There's an all you can eat menu that is available at night for 30$/person and it's worth it."}
{"text":"It is true the interior design of this restaurant is very well done, impressive use of lights to highlight the bright colours.
The service was good, as we were party of eight we had the attention of more then one person.
The food is delicious, the peanut butter dumplings and the crispy spinach are my favourite. I'm a salad freak: the papaya, mango, house salads are well sized and perfectly dressed. There is a testing menu that is all you can eat and the list of dishes you can pick from is impressive.
Beware of the tasting menu delays. The food comes late and you need to remind about your order. Whoever ordered a la carte received the food on time, but for some of my friends the waiting for their tasting menu choices was too much.
Small things that matter: rest rooms are not clean by the end of the working hours and cigarette smell as soon as the kitchen closed."}
{"text":"Bring your own, great decor and atmosphere. Food is typically better than average Thai restaurants! Definitely worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"Been there recently, and i noticed better service... As for food it's as great as usual"}
