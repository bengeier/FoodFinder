{"text":"A great little cozy pub tucked away in Yorkville. They've got lots of fun shooters and drinks for decent prices, and the food is really good for a pub. There's a pretty big menu with lots of pub classics: fish & chips, burgers, sandwiches, chicken wings, ribs, salads, etc. Both the classic & veggie burgers here are some of the best I've ever had. Service has always been friendly and fast. There are also lots of TVs and they play a variety of sports events, and there's a pool table. Also not full of annoying drunk students, so it's a great place for a nice relaxing drink after work on Friday."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Flat beer. Bad service. Uncomfortable atmosphere. 
Gross."}
{"text":"Normally, I go to this pub during TIFF when I am in the area.
Recently, I had some time to spare and just dropped in for a pint and a snack. Had some \"peel & eat\" shrimps which were just great and hit the spot."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for drinks and no complaints so far. I usually have wings, nacho, burger and pizza to accompany my drinks, which are always delicious. Beer choice is limited and there are no cocktails but they are cheap. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Big playoff night so very busy.  Staff excellent.  Food atrocious. Even the soup of the day .. Chicken noodle.. Slimy macaroni, chicken in a beef broth.  Burger worse than fast food .  Go for sports but not for food.  Everything seemed deep fried & frozen .  Good selection of beer ."}
{"text":"The Foxes Den must be approached with a very clear piece of information in mind: it is one of the closest pubs to Queen's Park, the seat of the Ontario Legislative Assembly (the State Congress for our southern cousins), and its greatest interest is in this particular crowd it attracts.

On any given sessional Monday to Wednesday night, you may find a few Members sipping beer and having dinner with their staff, stakeholders or hosting a pub night. I have seen ministers, Washington envoys and Members of the Legislature of almost every party ordering a drink and socializing outside the partisan, televised legislative bubble. 

Know this: it seems to be more popular with the Progressive Conservative and (occasionally) Liberal caucuses, while the New Democrats hang out at the Fox and Fiddle on Wellesley.

If you do come with the intent of political networking, please be quick, discreet and humble, as politics is the last thing on people's minds at the foxes den.

Now, to the food and beers.

Beer selection is excellent and decently priced. I prefer going for the premium domestic brands, and in Ontario you can get quite a beauty of a microbrew.

Food selection is excellent. I would steer away from the bangers and mash (too little banger in my opinion), but if you become a regular they may have something in store for you off-the-menu. Otherwise, the portions are fantastic and the size of the bar ensures you can have a decent conversation without losing your voice. Moreover, the smokers among us can enjoy the comfort of the patio without the added stigma of smoking on the sidewalk.

Foxes Den is a run-of the-mill, sizeable pub with a very particular crowd. Knowledge is power."}
{"text":"Very basic but fine pub food.  Oddly, their Asian dishes are their strong ones, I believe the owner and kitchen staff are Asian so that would make sense.  Pricey, and the service can be good or bad depending on the mood of the server in charge.  

Major downside is they refuse to do separate bills for large groups.  I get that's it's a pain but many, many places do this.  They won't even let you pay off your part of the tab if you are leaving early from a large group."}
{"text":"So I stumbled upon this place years ago and like to frequent it once in awhile. The servers are friendly (I think there is a Polish woman who mans the bar most days) and the food is good. I usually just get a burger and salad and both are yummy. They tend to overdress the salad so maybe ask for the salad dressing on the side. Lots of TVs, locals and bathrooms on the main floor (always a treat in Toronto). Plenty of beers on tap, too."}
{"text":"Daily beer specials. Friendly staff. Cheap pool ($2). Patio. Eats."}
{"text":"The Hubster and I came here for a quick bite before a movie at the Manulife Centre just north of here. There was a panini special going on, so he had the club panini with salad and fries for $8.99. I had a pound of wings for $10. We both had some drinks.

We sat on the patio, which was nice, but obscured from the street with some really high foliage. In fact, at one point, some guy peered in between the bushes, Friendly Giant giraffe style right beside our table. Very creepy. 

The service was also very good. The server was friendly, and came to check on us at reasonable times.

The food kind of sucked. The Hubster was not at all impressed by his panini (the fries were okay) and I'm pretty sure that my wings were frozen costco wings with Frank's Red Hot sauce on them. I'm not certain that they are the worst wings i've ever had, but they're in the running.

We might return because the service was good and the drinks were great, but we won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"The great thing about The Foxes Den is consistency.  Lots of screens to watch the game.  The quality of the food is always amazing.  The staff are incredible. And Honestly, the people are pretty great too.

This is the bar you throw up when no one can think of something to do, and everyone always goes, ya, it's always a good time. let's do that.

Also, one time, we stepped in to the Twilight Zone here.  Now, I'm not bragging or anything, but I'm not the ugliest dude on the planet.  But that night, I was.  It was like HOT GUY/GAL CENTRAL!  Couldn't believe this little hole in the wall off Bay street was hosting the likes of the cutest of the cute.  Very Outer Limits.

Anyways, if you're looking for somewhere consistent, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times now for after work drinks. The service is super fast and pleasant. As soon as an empty glass touches the table there is usually someone there asking if you want another. I like that. There are daily drink specials as well. Got a long island iced tea for $3.50 for something different between beers. The beer is a dollar more than the other place we go and the patio doesn't have a very good view of anything, but it's a good enough place to unwind after working all day."}
{"text":"Not much of a story here. Friday afternoon , I was walking along bay when one of their drunk customers out front eyed me down and smacked me on the back. Rough place."}
{"text":"Went here with 10 people from work, we didn't get the chance to call and give noticed but they were happy (and very able, not a lot of people in there when we went, a Friday at about 5) to take us in. They put us in the back room and sat us all down, promptly taking our orders. Every single one of my party enjoyed their food, I got the steak sandwich, other people got the burger, pizza, shepherds pie, soup, nachos, chocolate cake.

Every single person loved their meal, service was good and we all had a good time. Great pub, for groups and for individuals. My favorite downtown pub."}
{"text":"We were down in the neighborhood, headed to a Christmas concert nearby. We were both pretty hungry, and this place looked pretty good both on Yelp and from the outside, so we decided to duck in and check it out.

It's pretty dark, but actually quite spacious. There were a number of regulars at the bar, and we were quickly taken to a table and were able to take a look at the beer menu. 

The beer menu was pretty straightforward, mostly macros, and a couple of local micros. It wasn't a totally outstanding beer selection, but it wasn't terrible.

It was pretty quiet in general, and the service was very friendly and attentive. I had fish and chips, which were great but not outstanding, and Lee had the steak and mushroom pie, which he really enjoyed.

I would definitely head back here for dinner in the area. It's nice and cozy!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the best food. 
Why the high rating?

I am notorious for being an elitist, and normally I complain about service in Toronto all the time. Literally, every meal ends with \" This would never do in Manhattan\"...

so when I met a friend here at 10 pm on a Sunday night, my expectations were low.

This literally is a den- as in i stood bewildered on Bay st and he crawled out to meet me. I walked in to find the World cup playing with an electic mix of men at the bar, and groups scattered throughout. We had a few glasses of Pinot  as I chenneled my inner Ramona before realiing I was hungry, and our waitress was so friendly she talked me into getting the chili nachos. I know she said it was a lot, but the plate was MASSIVE..and they were delicious.

The  lighting is dim enough to be seductive yet casual. Love that its steps to  home, will definitely be back to try out the bar for a nightcap"}
{"text":"My neighbourhood bar. 

I love the staff and often drink with them. Til the wee hours.

Great daily food and drink specials.  Cheap pool and darts.  Good atmosphere for sports games on one of them many televisions."}
