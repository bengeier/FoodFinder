{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough. Hands down the most 'authentic' Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area wiith mouth watering dishes that really make you question what you've been eating from all those other places this whole time. 

One bone to pick, where I was staying was just outside their 3 mile delivery area so had to pick up. Also, particularly during the holidays, business is high, and they are short staffed so you might have to wait for front of house to get to you while taking phone orders, seating guests and cashing delivery orders. I highly recommend calling first and then picking it up. 

But, aside from that unpleasantness, their food is exemplary, (orange chicken,  crispy duck and chicken dumplings are divine) and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"For those that live in this neighborhood know, Chengdu has been a long time coming. As I live very close to this establishment, I have walked by this place since the windows were covered in brown paper. Having waited so long for the opening of this place, I initially was worried that I might have built it up too much in my mind, but my dinner this evening assuaged my fears: Chengdu Gourmet has all the talent needed for quality Chinese. 

I'll get one negative out of the way: the service is not the quickest in the world. It is polite, friendly, and courteous, but it is not fast. This does not extend to the food, which comes out hot and fresh.

Both my dish (the Mongolian beef) and my significant other's (General Tso's Tofu) were cooked perfectly, and the sauces on both were very good. 

The food is already top notch, and if the service just overcomes the speed issue, Chengdu will be a five star restaurant in my book. As it stands, it is still the best meal I've had out in a while, and will be recommended to anyone in the neighborhood looking for a great meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Disclaimer -- i had my food delivered -- i did not eat in the restaurant.

The sesame chicken was ok - kind of soggy, but still decent i guess if you are hungry enough.

The pan fried dumplings were also soggy but ok. The dipping sauce tasted watered down.

The bubble milk tea was AWFUL!!!!! The tea was ok but the boba were absolutely terrible - hard, chalky, weird consistency and taste. I was very disappointed because i love bubble tea and was really looking forward to it...... :-/"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I'm a regular for the three pepper chicken/tofu. There's a new chef , Mr. Hua, who made the best one I've ever eaten ."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night. As a Chinese, their food is fair, not authentic but good enough compared to most Chinese restaurants here, will give 3-4 stars.

Service? Not good. Not very friendly, not really responding, seemed angry at everyone in the restaurant, at least this was true last night. May be they were quite busy, but 1 star for our serving there.

There are several fair Chinese restaurants in squirrel hill, I had similar level of food but way much better serving at other places. So why should I bother to come back?"}
{"text":"I ordered the steamed pork potstickers which were doughy and very thick-D. The tofu with vegetables was overcooked and bland tasting.
I'm Chinese- maybe I would get acceptable food if they saw me. Won't patronize again."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food! Went with friends and enjoyed the food! Like the chicken the most !"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via Grubhub on Saturday night. Had a hankering for Chinese food and every place I tried to order from was closed. Chengdu was open and accepted online orders - perfect. 

Food arrived 25 minutes before the estimated delivery time. Portions were enormous, enough food for at least 5 meals. I ordered beef with broccoli and General Tao's chicken. Both were well prepared, very tasty and had enough sauce to top the white rice included with the order. 

Would definitely order again the next time a craving for Chinese hits me!"}
{"text":"Drove 40 miles round trip just to try this place.  Read about it in the Pittsburgh magazine and was excited to give it a try.   So tired of Americanized Chinese food and anxious to have more authentic/traditional style Chinese food.  Very disappointing and the worst Chinese we have ever tasted... and we have lived in other states and overseas for years and have had excellent to very poor Chinese food.  Chengdu Gourmet is by far the worst we have ever had!  VERY VERY SALTY.  Ordered three different dishes and could only eat a couple of bites."}
{"text":"The dumplings were marvelous and the portions of our food were generous. I recommend coming here. It was a good time."}
{"text":"We ordered off of grub hub on their western menu and it was solid! Nothing blew me away, but Western Chinese never does. The meal seemed reasonably healthy for Western Chinese. Will be ordering from them again!

Recommendations off the Western menu:

Honey Walnut Chicken for something sweet.
Braised Tofu for a lighter fare."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Unassuming from the outside, and fairly typical for an independent, authentic, ethnic restaurant.  The walls are decorated with photos of their food.  The tables are covered in a white paper, which is probably smart as the food can get a little messy.

Food: Authentic Szechuan at it's best.  I won't claim to be a Chinese food or Schecuan connoisseur by any means, but it was easy to tell that this food was authentic and it was delicious.  Our group ordered family style the spicy Chengdu noodles, flaming rabbit, flaming fish, Tofu, and a vegetable dish similar to kim-chi.  Overall the food was excellent, albeit on the spicy side.  We ordered everything without asking for any modifications, though if you are not into spicy food they are willing to adjust the order as necessary.  I was a little surprised that the spicy Chengdu noodles were served cold, but the flavor was great and they made for a good appetizer.  The rabbit was very good, but had little chunks of bone mixed in with the meet, making it somewhat difficult to eat.  The fish was also quite tasty but a little on the oily side.  The tofu was on the gelatinous side but also tasted awesome.

Drinks: BYOB!  Always a plus.

Service: Our servers were very attentive at keeping the water glasses re-filled, which we found to be important given the spiciness of the food.

Tips: Probably not a good date spot early on in a relationship unless you are trying to show your date how well you can clear out your sinuses and tear up your eyes while eating, while at the same time getting food all over the table.  Also it was quite warm in side the restaurant, probably 10 degrees warmer than the 70 or so temp outside.  I'm not sure if they have AC, but the front door was open and the ceiling fans were on.  Still, given the high number of heating flames on the tables it got warm.

Overall: Great tasting food for those willing to branch out, and a relaxed BYOB environment."}
{"text":"Cook is veey poor. We should pay 60, and place 100 in the table for charge. We wait for about ten minutes, then a man came there and asked us wether he could keep all of them. He meant to take the 40 dollars for the tips! My god! NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. NEVER TELL MY FRIEND TO GO!"}
{"text":"The food from the traditional menu looked great I had the Chengdu Spicy Beef In a flaming pan. The taste was great the spicy level was perfect for me, \"I like hot food\" the presentation looked good but the flaming pan was missing. They could have add more quantity of rice, for the price I needed more food. The seating is uncomfortable, the booth is to far from the table. Overall is good, they need to change so they could separated further from your typical Chinese restaurant. I will come back."}
{"text":"Below average food, below average service. Very dirty restroom, hair founded in the rice and on the soup. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"The person who delivered my food today (Saturday afternoon) stood at my door and demanded a tip.  I told him that I do not have cash but would gladly pay with the credit card.  A few minutes after he left, he texted me to tell me to not call this restaurant with an order again because of not giving him a tip. He said that I\" have to pay his gas and the cost of labor.\"  The order had omitted several items.  When I told him that, he said that this is not his fault, as he does not pack the orders. This person spoiled my appetite for what is usually an excellent meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite szechuan restaurant, and probably my favorite Chinese restaurant ever. We go there almost once a week since we discovered the place, and they know us on sight.

Like many other chinese restaurants in this area, there is a real menu and an American-Chinese menu (with things like Lo Mein). I can't imagine why you would come here and order off of the American menu, or why on earth you'd come here looking for lo mein like another reviewer. 

We went on the recommendation of a friend who is Chinese and fell in love instantly. The mushroom flaming pan is sublime (comparable to, if not better than the fish version), their szechuan dumplings are the best I've ever had, their spicy beef dish is has wonderfully simultaneously juicy and chewy texture with a perfect balance of szechuan peppercorn zing and straight up hot pepper. I love that they almost always have pea shoots on the menu - it's one of my favorite green vegetables. Last night we tried a pork belly dish with water chestnuts that was just... incredible. 

I always eat until I can barely breathe, and it's become more and more crowded since we started going. You will wait if you come past 7pm. I'd recommend a reservation.

We once ordered a number of dishes including the mushrooms in flaming pan, and we were disappointed, because it wasn't as spicy as usual. We mentioned it to the server and the chef came out and told that since we ordered so many dishes with the same flavor profile, he modified it in a way that he thought would balance better! We were impressed.

It is hard to go wrong here, but a few dishes have been misses: tea smoked duck, the whole fish in bean sauce, and the smoked pork belly."}
{"text":"Chengdu did something to me that no other restaurant has ever done before. We ordered delivery from them via GrubHub and requested that everything in the order be vegetarian. When we opened our order, we found pork in one of our dishes. Not a big deal, right? We called the restaurant, fully expecting them to either refund that dish or replace it with the vegetarian version that we ordered, but they refused to do either. They said they were \"too busy\"--too busy to correct an order that they messed up? It is unacceptable for any restaurant to make a mistake and refuse to correct it.

Here's how we came to our 1 star rating. We started with 5 stars, because the food is pretty tasty. Then we took off 1 star for messing up the order. We took off another star for refusing to replace it. And we took off another star because they didn't refund the dish. We took off one last star for their negative attitude when we called, a phone call that ended with the restaurant hanging up on me. That leaves them with 1 measly star and 1 less customer, because I will never go back there. 

With options like Sichuan Gourmet and How Lee in the neighborhood, there is no reason to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"An unexpected treat! We ordered from the red menu and had an outstanding meal. The exterior of the restaurant is unassuming (understatement). However, the food was excellent and different than what we usually find in the New York area. We will dine here again."}
{"text":"Too expensive to match the taste. Materials are not professional. Not recommend if you are a true Chinese dishes eater."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I'd go five stars normally for Chengdu Gorment, but I don't think 3.5 stars for this place is fair so I guess I'm trying to do my small part to get this where it should be.  Great food, BYOB, affordable and not another stripmall Asian fusion place.  Was that what you 3 and below star folks were looking for anyway?  EDIT: OK, reading back through other reviews, it looks like the nice folks at Chengdu are not impressing people with their delivery skills.  So, I'm sticking with my 5 stars, but do recommend just eating in.  Come on, it's BYOB and you need to get off the couch anyway!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal. We loved the crispy cucumbers, cumin lamb, ginger duck and crispy chicken. The bubble tea is a must as well. The service was superb and the restaurant is impeccable. It doesn't get better than this."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food restaurant! I was telling my uncle how I cannot find any good Chinese places at home and he said he would like to take us to one in town. So we went for an early dinner.

We ordered the general tso chicken with white meat. The green beans. And the pad Thai with shrimp. The pad Thai was good, a little different from what we are used to... didn't see any peanuts nor did it come with fresh lime. Maybe that's what we get for ordering pad Thai at a Chinese place. The white meat general chicken was delicious. I was thankful for an all white meat option. It wasn't spicy at all though. The green beans were good too. Not overcooked and limp, but firm and flavorful. 

Service was good also. Just wish they would give ice water without asking. Seems like the water I received was missing the ice! Ha ha! 

I would still come back to eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet further up the road was my first introduction to legitimate Sichuan Chinese cuisine here in Pittsburgh. While I still love SG, Chengdu takes top prize based on my first two times here. Probably best for take out more often than not, unless you're after one of their flaming pan dishes, which are great. 

I've had their pork dumplings in spicy red chili sauce, quonqing (crispy) chicken, and three cup chicken. Both are perfect dishes. 

They have plenty of unique offerings like rabbit, frog."}
{"text":"Came here after visiting Phipps , it's a James beard nominated chef there ... highly recommend the szchwean pot stickers . Great mix of American and authentic menu items . Doesn't look the greatest from the outside just a warning but Great otherwise"}
{"text":"I ordered GrubHub delivery and so my experience was with take-out only.  
I ordered wonton soup, an egg roll, chicken and broccoli and steamed pork dumplings. The soup was bland and the wontons were mushy - I ate about 1/4 of the soup and threw the rest away. The egg roll was good, but it's a good thing that I'm not allergic to shrimp - there was not mention of shellfish in the egg roll and I assumed that it was pork. The dumplings were okay - appropriately doughy and chewy, but the dumpling sauce was also very, very bland. Finally, the chicken and broccoli was bland and slightly too sweet. Again, I threw most of it away. The portions are large, but what good is a large portion if the food is not edible? I was happy that they do have brown rice. The delivery was fast, but the food wasn't exactly hot when it arrived. The driver was very nice and friendly. Sorry, but there's too much good Asian food in Squirrel Hill to patronize mediocre restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Chengdu Gourmet again last night for dinner. When I placed my order through Yelp, it said it would be ready within 45-60 minutes. It was a Monday, so I'm thinking this place must be good for a pickup order to take that long on a Monday. I ordered the Jingle Bell chicken, and I ordered General Tsos Tofu for my boyfriend. Online, the description for the Jingle Bell chicken indicated that the dish had chicken, wood ear mushrooms, snow peas and baby corn all in a tangy but spicy sauce. It was also served with a side of fried wonton. When I opened my entrée, there were no baby corn (my favorite and a reason why I ordered this dish) and instead there were water chestnuts (I can't stand them). Also, the sauce was a white sauce (I thought it would have been brown, but the description didn't specify). The sauce lacked flavor and was neither tangy nor spicy. 

My boyfriend's tofu looked good, but it lacked any veggies at all. When ordering, the site asked how spicy we would like the tofu. I chose spicy (next to last on the spice scale) and the sauce wasn't spicy at all. 

I've tried this place a few times and I haven't been overly impressed in any of my visits, so I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Already tried so many dishes on their list and almost all taste really good. Chongqing chick was superb! Reasonable price. In terms of menu variety and food taste, I personally think Chengdu Gourmet is much better than Sichuan Gourmet or other chinese restaurant in the area. The only thing they need to improve is the service. The staff should smile more and learn about service excellence."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this restaurant! They were recently added to Foodler so I was able to find them to try something new. The pad thai was delicious with a generous serving. My husband enjoyed the sesame beef very much and had plenty left over for the next day. My daughter picked from our plates and loved it, which is rare because she usually sticks to noodles. The crab rangoon may be the best I've ever had. We will be ordering here again in the future! Yummy!"}
{"text":"My friends told me that's a relatively new restaurant and I thought it worth a try. 

My experience there is just disappointing. Food is not fresh. We order 4 dishes, but the fish and pork are not fresh and smells bad. Don't the fooled by the pics on the menu, the actual dishes will come with nothing like the pics. 

The service is terrible. One of the waitress is nice, though. But others seem to be unhappy with there job. No one asked us about how the food is throughout the dinner. We wait for 10mins to get the change. And the male waiter came and asked us whether they can keep the change. The dinner cost 60 and we put 100 on the table. It's ridiculous that he think his service deserves 70% tips. 

That should be my first but the last visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy pork intestine with silk tofu. I'm from the south and like to think we know what to do with a pig - the whole hog - but this is one treatment for chitlins we should have invented ourselves. It was a perfect mix of contrasting tastes and textures. Soft, mild tofu and tender, chewy intestine were smothered in a bright red sauce of (I think) chili, sichuan pepper, garlic, and chili oil and topped with bright fresh cilantro and bits of peanut. The spice level was just right. Invigorating and addictive, with that numbing sensation in the mouth with the nose starting to run heat in the nose. It was so good I nearly polished off the whole serving which was definitely sized to share. I just managed to put my chopsticks down in time to keep enough for tomorrow's lunch. 

My waitress, Sandy or Shelly I think, was very nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Chinese food I have found in Pittsburgh. My husband and I went right after he got back from a work trip in China and he had actually spent some time in Chengdu. The food there is very spicy and very oily and typically multiple dishes are shared at a table and this is what we did. We ordered crispy pickled cucumber, Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper Chongqing Style - a popcorn chicken type of thing with hot chili flakes (fried to perfection! this dish was our favorite) a tea smoked flavor duck -also very good- and a Dan Dan noodle (I avoid noodles but my friends at the table loved this). I have to say this is truly an expansive menu that is not expensive! I really appreciate different variations on styles of food preparations that I enjoy in Chinese restaurants that are open to focusing on different regional cuisines. We have not used the delivery service so I can't comment on that, but the eat-in experience was great. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, very highly recommended and a unique experience in this area."}
{"text":"I'll just go ahead and start my review our strongly by saying this is hands-down the best Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area. I've never really found Chinese food that I would consider authentic or even actually tasty anywhere in the city. Chengdu Gourmet has both of those qualities. My boyfriend and I order from Chengdu at least twice a month. We use Postmates delivery and it's a great date night in. 

We both prefer them their authentic Chinese menu, however their American menu isn't bad either (their general tso's chicken is definitely the best we've ever had). Their menu is very big, so we try to switch it up every time we order at least a little bit. However like any restaurants some things are definitely better than others. Our favorites include:

*The Chengdu Sliced Pork Belly
 It's not too fatty or overpowering as pork belly can often be. We essentially use it as a side dish because we usually split this dish because we both immensely enjoy it. 

*Spicy Lamb Flaming Pan
Honestly, it's really not that spicy, it has a little kick but nothing that you can't handle. It's cooked with an assortment of vegetables and really flavorful and complex dish. I feel like sometimes run-of-the-mill Chinese food just taste like a muddled mush of flavors. You can taste the different spices and components to the dish and they all work quite nicely together.

*Hunan Lamb
Even though the name of this dish insinuates that lamb should be the star, I was most impressed by the vegetables in this dish. The lamb was cooked perfectly fine, it was tender and flavorful. However the vegetables really shined in this dish. They were not overcooked and have the perfect amount of bite still left in them. The textural contrast between the vegetables and the meat makes his dish work really well. 

*General Tso's Chicken
Now I know, the obvious appeal of this place is the authentic Chinese food. However, I think every American college student has and affinity for a good General Tso's chicken  (or even not so good General Tso's chicken).  Their take on this American Chinese dish has just enough spice to make it interesting. The chicken is cooked well, just crispy enough but not over fried. The sauce is just enough but does not overpower the dish. 

I think my only real complaint about Chengdu Gourmet is that the food is not nearly spicy enough. That being said, I understand that super spicy food is often not what most diners want. With a generous portions and a wide selection of options, that will keep both adventurous and picky eaters content, Chengdu is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"If you're new to authentic Chinese food, this is a great place to dip your toes in. I always order my usual Americanized standards, but I also pick one new item each time to try. My favorite so far has been the beef tendon. Granted, I have no experience with other beef tendon, but I thought this was delicious. 

If you Grub Hub, I've NEVER had a meal from this place show up late or cold."}
{"text":"?????????????????
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I'm really torn about this place. Their food is a bit tastier than Sichuan Gourmet up the road (which was already pretty good), and they give better portions. For a while it was my go-to place for Sichuanese takeout. However, after a few disastrous take-out experiences I think I'm giving up.

A couple of weeks ago I placed my traditional order of Shredded Pork and Dry-fried Green Beans over the phone. They confirmed the price and time. However, when I picked up my order, they had substituted the Chinese menu shredded pork for the more expensive Americanized version. It was not good at all. However, I ordered by phone and can't really blame them for misunderstanding or \"misunderstanding\" an item with a similar name.

I decided to place orders on their website instead to remove any problems. For two orders this went great. It was ready for pickup on my way home from work, and the food was great. However, my most recent order was a disaster. When I got there to pick it up, the employee at the counter looked at me like I was nuts, insisting that they never got the order. I showed her the email, and she searched her desk. Finally she found the order, never sent to the kitchen, buried under some papers. She offered no apology and just said \"Wait 15 minutes.\" Given I had placed the order 45 minutes ago, that wasn't going to happen. I said to cancel the order, and she just nodded and then turned around and started talking to the other employee next to her. That was it, not even a \"sorry.\" Mistakes do happen, especially with printed orders. However, their dismissive way of handling it was really unfortunate.

I might go back to eat inside sometime soon because I love their food, but unfortunately given their level of service I don't think I can suggest ordering take-out."}
{"text":"This place definitely has authentic Sichuan cuisine.  I went with someone who was born in Sichuan province and whose mother always cooked in this style. He said he was definitely very good, but not the best in the city.  He got the spicy pork intestines and tofu and a cold sesame chicken appetizer.  He scarfed them both down.  I was less adventurous and got the diced chicken with dried pepper chongqing-style.  It was very good and spicy.  Maybe a little too spicy.  Don't get it if you don't like spicy.  Over all it is definitely worth checking out, but my Sichuan friend still says that Sichuan Gourmet up the street on Murray is just a little bit better."}
{"text":"Never been here before because a few friends said its a terrible place. But somehow I decided to give a shot today. For delivery, I live just a few blocks away and it takes less than 5 minutes to get here. And actually it took them 2 freaking hours to deliver me the cold, crappy food. Oh and btw, they missed my bubble tea too cuz they said the delivery man gave it to someone else. I didn't complain anything before I got my food cuz someone told me they spit in the food if you \"yell\" to them or tell them they suck. Anyway, they screw up all the time no matter you done there or you want delivery, DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic. A new favorite.

The food was served hot, and every dish exceeded my expectations. The staff was courteous and attentive, without being pushy. We could see employees hand-making dumplings; their effort is worthwhile as these are the best dumplings I've had in Pittsburgh. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery.  An hour and a half later still waiting!  Called in twice.  Each time I was told that \"I'm pretty sure that the driver is on the way.\"  Meaning--I have no idea what is going on in my restaurant.  I will not be ordering from them again.  Delivery is not complicated."}
{"text":"I ordered the meal from Postmates actually and I thought I would give it a shot based of the pictures that were provided. The sesame chicken was amazing l, the sauce was on point. It had a little kick to it which I really liked. The meal was also prepared spot on and I will admit my orders can tend to get a little confusing. 5 stars, looking forward to actually visiting the restaurant"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place made it onto Pittsburgh Magazine's list of \"best restaurants.\" Their recommendation is what made me drive all the way from the other side of the city to try it and I was beyond disappointed.  The one star I gave goes for the food - it was actually pretty good, but the place is FILTHY!! As soon as you walk in you notice the FILTH!! It is cluttered with \"stuff\" sitting everywhere and there is debris all over the floor. I almost turned around and left at that point, and I should have. After dinner, I had to use the restroom and I was hesitant based on how the dining room looked. I was right - more FILTH. The toilets had obviously not been cleaned in some time, nor had the stalls, as they were covered in a variety of what looked like \"drips\" or \"spills.\"  The watered down pink soap covered the sink, which also looked like it hasn't been cleaned recently. JUST ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!! I think the Health Department needs to pay a visit here, but, even if it does, I sure will NOT be returning. Shame on you Pittsburgh Magazine."}
{"text":"I've gotten delivery from here twice.  Both times the estimated delivery was 70-80 minutes (grubhub) but the food arrived in approximately 30 minutes.  

The double cooked pork belly was good, maybe a little dry, but had the right amount of fat/meat ratio.  The Kung Pao Chicken in Chengdu-Style (C1) was absolutely fantastic!  But you REALLY need to like spice and numbing peppers.  

The only \"miss\" so far was an order of P9 - Cold Sesame Noodles.  No spice - just peanut butter and granulated sugar.  baaad."}
{"text":"We like to go here as a group and each order a different dish and share family style. So far I've yet to have a bad dish. By far my favorite chinese place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is located right under the bowling alley!! For you fine here please note that the ambiance is not terrible but that when your thoughts are interrupted by a \"boom\" every few seconds (though not that loud) it may be a deal breaker.

I am comparing this restaurant directly to Sichuan gourmet (SG).
This place isn't bad, the food and menu are very similar if not for a large part identical to SG.

We ordered our usual of cumin beef (more tender than SG) and snow pea shoots (just as good). I had a miss with ordering the holiday special: crispy eggplant which was literally like a general tso or Asian Americanized version of battered eggplant which was very bizarre to me. My fault for ordering something different, it as crispy and well seasoned tho.

Service is off. They still don't have a good system, the 3 female staff were flitting between the 7-8 tables that were full without good communication. We got asked if we wanted drinks twice. We also had to pack our own leftovers (not a big issue) but SG often does this for you.

Overall good food, ambiance is lacking with bowling alley noise and because it just doesn't muster up to SG we will be going there from now on."}
{"text":"The quality of food in this restaurant is falling faster than a rock.  The chicken dish we ordered was all bone with hardly any meat.  All the dishes were too salty.  Last time I will visit this once promising restaurant. Eat at your own peril!"}
{"text":"Listen up all you cool kids, and you know who I mean. Those of you looking for authentic ethnic food at a great price, maybe a BYOB establishment.

I was wowed by everything we ordered, it was all delicious. It wasn't as spicy as what I was expecting, however it was all authentically prepared and very flavorful.

The best way to order is family style, and to share dishes.  

Sichuan is one of the world's greatest cuisines, and you can find out why at Chengdu. There are 2 menus, but I definitely recommend you stay with the authentic menu, not the watered down Americanized menu.

This restaurant has been winning lots of awards, especially from local chefs, and you owe it to yourself to find out why!"}
{"text":"Traditional menu is quite good. The Mapo tofu is my favorite as they add spiced minced beef that is amazing. Casserole dishes are also great. The traditional menu has a fantastic variety to keep you interested for many visits!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food is really great.  Don't expect a fancy place. Go for the food!"}
{"text":"In China, Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province. In Pittsburgh, Chengdu Gourmet is my go-to restaurant for authentic cuisine. I always enjoy the pork belly, duck, green beans, eggplant, and more. Along with GREAT FOOD, Chengdu Gourmet has quick, friendly service and reasonable prices. No-frills decor. BYOB. Street parking. Delivery available. A Pittsburgh gem - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group. Everyone at my table I repeat everyone got sick within 36 hours. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor - get to this place, and DO NOT order off of the \"American\" Chinese menu. Order the authentic stuff from the traditional Chinese menu. Some of it might not be familiar, but it's great. My favorites are the Pork Meatballs with spicy sauce - delicious, tender, juicy, and mild-medium spice. The dry sauteed green beans with minced pork sauce are also delicious.

I'm also a fan of the Chengdu (chinese style) style Kung Pao Chicken. This is loaded with schezuan peppercorns. If you have never tried schezuan peppercorns, be ready for a different experience. For some people, myself included, these peppercorns produce an unusual but oddly pleasing numbing sensation in your mouth. I really like it.  You can, of course, order American style...but what's the fun in that!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Spicy and flavorful! Perfect food for a snowy and cold day like today! Authentic Sichuan cuisine. I'm from China so you can take my word for it. Might be a little greasy and spicy for those of you who have a lighter taste but this is perfect for me! 

My only complaint is that the waitress seemed unfamiliar with the menu. We ordered two dishes to share which turned out to have the same ingredients and similar tastes. The waitress should have offered some advice. 

Other than that, food was great. Service was quick. Portion size was big. Definitely will come back next time I visit Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Chengdu twice since moving to Squirrel Hill.  The first time, I wasn't impressed with anything we ordered.  It was over-sauced and overly sweet.   We eliminated it from contention and kept looking for the best Chinese place in the area.  

Three months later and having sampled several other places in the area, I forget that we had eliminated this one already and ordered from there again.  I thought we'd missed it and decided to give it a try since it was listed as one of Pittsburgh Magazine's best restaurants of 2016.  That list is usually pretty great, but they definitely missed on this one.  Attempt #2 here produced another variation of the same overly sweet, gloppy, soggy mess that we got the first time.  There was no spice at all on the entrée and the rice seemed old and dry.  The wontons were super chewy and did not come with any sauce.  It also took more than an hour to get despite being an easy 1/2 mile straight walk from my house.  Also, it was delivered by a sullen looking guy with a big growling monster face printed on his crotch.  Ick."}
{"text":"Dinner at Chengdu Gourmet was a delight. Cold sesame noodles were very tasty. The pot stickers were also excellent. Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper Chongqing-Style was perfect, each piece perfectly crispy yet moist inside. And the dry fried green beans were also great. 
The service was so-so, and the waitress sat down at another table and was having her own meal. That seems kind of low rent as I hate to ask someone to stop eating to get me something, but hey, that's her job. But she was pleasant."}
{"text":"I have only had delivery, so I can't comment on the restaurant itself, but I have ordered from here several times and always received generous servings of good, fresh food.  They have a lot of variety and serve both Chinese and Chinese-American dishes, so those of you craving real Chinese food can go with friends who are more comfortable with familiar Americanized dishes and everyone will be happy.  This is where I head when I'm craving pork belly (they serve it several ways, all good), but I've never had a main dish from here - meat, seafood, or veggie - that I didn't like.  Four stars because their hot and sour soup was incredibly disappointing - I couldn't even finish it - and hot and sour soup is one of my favorite foods."}
{"text":"New Szechuan restaurant with genuine Chengdu chef. They have a westernized menu, but for the good stuff look to the Chinese one. Dishes are authentic and inexpensive. There is a lot of variety to the dishes but certainly most are at least somewhat spicy."}
{"text":"6 of us went for dinner on a Saturday night and got the last available table. The restaurant has a very casual vibe and seems more like a takeout place when you first walk in. We all ordered off the Chinese menu which I definitely recommend. A few of us got plates to share. The appetizers came out within minutes. The Sichuan dumplings in chili oil were amazing. Pork filling and the oil wasn't overly spicy. We also got the crispy chicken and the beef flaming pan. Both were tasty. Both dishes came with rice, which helped to counter the spice. They don't ask you your preferred spice level, which was fine with us because we love spicy food but many of the dishes were quite spicy. One appetizer and 2 entrees were plenty for the 3 of us to share. Only complaint is the service, which was not great. They placed dishes down in the middle of the table without explaining what they were, we sat without water on multiple occasions and while the food came out very quickly we waited for awhile before our waitress even came close enough to our table to wave to her for the check."}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic Chinese food. Every dish was delicious, had a lot of depth, and very satisfying. The special fish with the \"secret\" sauce was incredible and delicate in flavor. Shared family style, the price per a person is also insanely reasonable for the quality, for a large group."}
{"text":"I was super pumped to finally try this place after having been a loyal worshipper of the Sichuan Gourmet enterprise.  My fiance and I came for dinner on a Sunday night to see if this supposed spin-off measures up.

One of my biggest takeaways was that the service was night and day compared to the Squirrel Hill SG location.  I wish that servers at Chinese restaurants like this were in the habit of introducing themselves, because our waitress was pretty awesome.  The restaurant was fairly empty when we got there, but by the time we left, she was juggling numerous tables but still managed to return our check in like 30 seconds flat.  The 3 dishes we ordered all came out incredibly quickly, before we even expected them.  So yes, major kudos for service, Chengdu.

Onto the food.  I had my favorite order of SPICY MULTI-MUSHROOM IN FLAMING PAN for comparison, and my S.O. tried the BEEF HO FUN NOODLES.  The best thing about the mushrooms is that they weren't drowning in oil like they always are at SG.  Besides that though, I didn't like the dish quite as much as SG's.  It had some nice heat, and the mushroom mix included sliced plain white button mushrooms, enokis, white beech, some oyster shrooms, and some nice big chunks of king oyster shrooms, but I missed the shiitakes and straw mushrooms that SG includes.  The dish just also didn't have as much depth of flavor, and the mushrooms didn't taste, for lack of a better word, as meaty.  I know, I know.  I'm super picky.  It's not your fault, Chengdu Gourmet, your dish was plenty awesome.  But if I had to pick a winner for flavor, Sichuan Gourmet wins out.

My very easy-to-please fiance loved his noodle dish, and the few slivers of onions and been sprouts I picked out of it were pretty decent in flavor, though I can't comment on the rest.  Which leads me to my only major gripe about the food here.  Both of our dishes pretty much lacked any veggies in them (the noodles literally had 8 lonely slivers of onion and maybe a dozen sprouts), which we've pretty much come to expect from the dishes at Sichuan, offering a nice contrast, especially to the very heavy meaty dishes.  Both of our plates turned out very...brown.  We tried to find a dish with a good mix of meat and veggies when we were ordering, but our waitress couldn't offer any strong suggestions, even after discussing it with a counterpart.  They both lamented (in Mandarin) at our request that basically all their dishes are either all meat or all veggie.  This probably isn't a big deal for most, but I grew up with a tradition of having something green on the table, so this just isn't peachy for me.  I ended up ordering a CHINESE BROCCOLI QUICK FRIED IN BLACK PEPPER to compensate, which came out perfectly cooked--nice and crunchy with plenty of Sichuan peppercorn aroma--in under 5 minutes.

Thanks Chengdu for a great meal, and I'm glad I came to check it out, but I anticipate sticking with Sichuan Gourmet in the future, if for no other reason than they often offer sick deals on Restaurant.com and Groupon.  Nothing tastier than a good bargain.

TL;DR: SG wins Most Variegated Dishes, CG wins Most Likely to Help You Avoid Clogged Arteries.  The choice is yours."}
{"text":"I was really looking excited to eat here considering they were nominated for a James Beard award. I had pretty high expectations and was considerably let down. I always get hot and sour soup at every Chinese restaurant I go to. While this was hot and sour, it was less than enjoyable. The flavor was off-putting and way too pungent of mushroom flavor. Next I opted for the Kung Pao Chengdu style. Very flavorful and spicy. After a few bites I tossed it in the fridge where it will probably sit for a few days. Lastly I ordered the Jungle Bell chicken. This was edible at best. Had a sweet and sour taste that was watered down. Some kind of funky mushrooms that resembled a massive booger... Needless to say we weren't satisfied and since we're from out of town, will probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good eats. Not sure about the American Chinese menu, but why would you want that anyway? The Szechuan style food is hot, flavorful, and delicious. Run, don't walk, to have the Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper Chongqing Style. It is so spicy and deliciously addictive. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! We also had the sautéed shredded potatoes with vinegar and chilies and the dumplings in spicy oil. Waitress was super nice and our total including tax was $31. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"This food is top notch! I took my fiancé here about a week ago for his birthday. He had been talking about this place for months because the head chef was nominated for a James Beard Award.

Fancy? Nope. 
To be honest, the entrance and bathrooms are actually kind of scary. The booth I sat in was broken and the person on the other side kept pushing back throughout our whole dinner (how annoying). Most unfortunately, there is no AC in this place which makes eating the extra spicy food even a little more interesting.

Delicious food? Yep!
We had the spicy dumplings and pickled cucumbers as an appetizer. The sauce that the dumplings were in is actually making my mouth water just thinking about it. I suggest keeping some of the picked cucumbers to munch on throughout your meal to cool down your mouth. 
For dinner, we ordered the smoked pork belly and the beef flaming pot. As excited as I was for the pork belly, I should have asked, because it was not as I expected. It is more like a plate of thinly sliced pork belly aka bacon. Even though it wasn't what I expected, it was still tasty. The flaming beef pot is where it's at! The beef is tender. The sauce! SO addicting! Garlicky, oily, spicy, DELICIOUS.

Would I recommend? Absolutely! We will order again, but it will be as take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. All of their dishes have a ton of flavor, nothing boring at all. A breathe of fresh air in typical tasteless oily Pittsburgh Chinese food."}
{"text":"It took me way too long to write this review, but here we go. This restaurant is essentially the same as Sichuan Gourmet up the hill (not even considering the similarity in names--Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province, and the Chinese name of this place is actually \"Old Sichuan\"), as insiders will tell you that the head chef left the latter place to work at Chengdu Gourmet. So if the food at SG no longer feels the same as it did a year ago, come over here and give CG a try, as you might find what you miss.

As for me, I've found that CG has been a bit better on hygiene and service, particularly since it's much newer and not too many people know about it yet. As mentioned, the menu is very similar to SG since the chef used to work there. Having tried a few things here, like the double cooked pork belly (???), we can ascertain that some items are better here than at SG. Some others may be no different, and SG recently upped their game by expanding their menu and starting a VIP card program. Prices are comparable.

All in all, go to CG if you want a more low-key dining experience, while SG has a more lively atmosphere. And if you are feeling adventurous, the two restaurants have very different Specials menus, which are separate from the regular ones. Some things like the pork brain tofu are found at SG, while others like the mutton soup are at CG only."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best, most consistently good traditional places in pgh. Menu has a great variety and they do not shy away from making things spicy!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my end-of-year (now beginning-of-year) lunch there with my friend, Jeanette.  We brought a bottle of zin, which was very helpful in calming the spice.  We were told that the chef is formerly from Sichuan Gourmet.  There are several menus including an American Chinese menu, a traditional Szechuan menu, a listing of hot pots.  We ordered from the Szechuan menu and had fish filet in spicy broth, dumplings in Szechuan sauce, double cooked pork belly and ox tongue and tripe.  The ox tongue and tripe was the most flavorful with complex Szechuan spice, but it packs a wallop of heat.  It was served cold and the meat was very tender;.  I highly recommend.  The dumplings had a mixture of chili oil and soy sauce, which made them less spicy than I had thought.  The soy sauce added a sweetness to them.  The double cooked pork was served with green peppers and leeks.  It was tasty and very mild.  (The same dish from China Star is fiery).  Finally the fish, which was Jeanette's favorite, had lots of tender filets and spice, but not the same complex spice flavor as the tongue and tripe.  There were also chunks of what I think were celery and cabbage.  There are a lot more dishes to try, and soon they will have take out.  So we plan to return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by a Schezuan restaurant officionado, and it still exceeded my expectations.  Their menu is extensive and contains over a dozen rare dishes. #HighlyRecommended"}
{"text":"Good for pick-up. 10 to 15 minutes is always 10 to 15 minutes. The bubble tea seems a little watered down. Also I got a small rice and teryaki chicken on a stick (4 pieces) and a bubble tea for 11.50. Don't know how that price compares with other locations but I hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Delivery Service: 1 star

Ordered delivery from them four times in the past. Food was average - nothing spectacular, especially for the price. Some dishes that I have ordered in the past are Hand Cabbage, Spicy Fish Fillet in Silk Tofu, Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce, Wonton in Red Chili Oil, Hot & Sour Soup. They're nothing special, but they satisfy the palate when Pittsburgh offers no alternatives.

Ordered delivery recently at 11:30am. By 1:10 there were still no updates on the order, so I called. The guy on the phone was aloof and unapologetic, telling me that there was some sort of error on their end and that they're working on it. That was all he told me - no explanation of *when* my order was  going to get to me (it's been almost two hours at this point), or if the order has even been prepared. I had to press him for this information, and he appeared annoyed by my questions. I finally got my order at 2pm, after two phone calls with the driver who \"couldn't find the building\". Mind you, I tipped $3 in addition to the $1 delivery fee they charge, all for 1 app and 1 entree, so don't tell me it's my fault for not paying for service. Total time since ordering: 2.5 hours, or literally 10% of my day.

What a waste of my time. I would've been better off WALKING to Squirrel Hill, bought some food, and walked back to my place and STILL had time to spare.

I've had my share of your mediocre Sichuan food. If I want to throw my money away I'm better off donating it to the panhandlers on my street."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday evening with my wife for dinner.  I had been looking forward to trying out Chengdu Gourmet ever since I first heard about it a couple of years earlier and had bookmarked it on Yelp.  The restaurant itself is located on Forward Ave in Squirrel Hill and the front of it makes it seem somewhat small.  However, once you are inside, it's actually quite a big space as it is rectangular in shape.  It's decorations are somewhat simple and the walls are decorated with pictures of some of the chefs food.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off with a couple of appetizers and went with the Sichuan dumplings in red chile Oil as well as the scallion pancakes.  Our appetizers came out together but our waitress had misheard our scallion pancakes as sweet potato pancakes and so we had to send them back for the right food.  In the meantime I was able to try the dumplings which were good.  The outside wrapper was cooked nicely and the filling was pretty flavorful.  Surprisingly the red chile oil wasn't too spicy and my favorite part of the sauce was the black sauce (Tamari or soy sauce?) underneath the oil which added a slight touch of saltiness and sweetness to the dish.  After I had finished with the dumplings our scallion pancakes made it out to us and they were worth the wait.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside while still being warm made them pretty perfect.  For our dinner entrees I ended up ordering the three pepper diced chicken while my wife went with the happy family.  At Chengdu Gourmet they actually have two menus, a traditional one and a normal one.  The reason that I mention this is that the traditional one has pictures of most of the food giving you a good idea of what you are ordering which is nice.  The three pepper diced chicken probably wouldn't have been my first choice if I hadn't seen the pictures but after I did I realized that it and its sister dish the diced chicken reminded me of one of my favorite dishes Chingqung Chicken.  Whenever it came out to us it looked exactly as it had on the menu.  Loads of three different types of peppers (finger hot, bell and dried red?) on top of a sizable portion of fried chicken.  As for the taste, well it was delicious.  Spicy enough that I could really tell it's presence but not enough to make me down a glass of water while eating it or immediately after.  My wife was also really pleased with her happy family and the amount of food that came with it, especially the shrimp, scallops and lobster tail.

The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in a heartbeat.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our meals here and I loved the fact that we could get both traditional and American Chinese food."}
{"text":"I came here to try traditional Chendu Szechuan cuisine and was happy.  Squirrel Hill is quickly becoming Pittsburgh's Chinatown- I read a review that raved about the silky tofu and pork intestine - I ordered and liked it-  but felt it was too heavy on the Szchuan oil - it pooled in the pot.  I also ordered the fish filet in hot pot ( a Traditional Chendu dish) note it is spicy-be ready with the rice-  it had the same sauce as the silky tofu was good but again had too much oil.  The two home runs were the water spinach with fresh garlic and the shreaded tea smoked duck with ginger.  Was not as cheap as I thought based on the other reviews- Entrees were around $16 they are large enough to share.  Service was fair polite but they forgot to serve rice and were hard to get refills on tea and water- I am not a fan of the utility of plastic chop sticks for picking up silky tofu but like that they are washable - I love the traditional family style food, large round tables and the thunder of the pins crashing on the bowling lanes upstairs."}
{"text":"I want to give Chengdu five stars because I think the potential is there but I just didn't have a five star experience.  
First, appetizers of crab rangoons and dumplings were delicious.  And came very quickly after ordering.
Then, our party of four did a family style order.  We had the broccoli and chicken (fine!), double cooked sliced pork belly (my favorite of the group) the mapo tofu (the tofu was like silk and the spice was on point) and the spicy lamb (wayyyyyy too salty!).  
The food really wasn't bad, it just didn't blow my mind away and the MSG and salt was too much.  I ate with my chopsticks which severely slowed my eating process (a good thing) but my friends who used forks and ate more were all kind of holding their stomachs afterwards from being bloated (and eating too much).  
I want to come back and try again.  My friends that I dined with had eaten here before and each said it wasn't their best experience there.  So maybe it was an off night?"}
{"text":"Hands down a culinary gem! Shredded Duck with baby ginger!!!!"}
{"text":"**Hole in the wall restaurant with tasty authentic Chinese food. Tucked away past Squirrel Hill, hidden gem for sure.

Right when we walked in, I think they knew I wasn't trying to get the American-Chinese menu, so we went straight for the Chinese menu (with the good stuff). Came here on a Saturday night and all I could hear were loud Chinese dads having a conversation. That's not a bad thing though. I mean.. it wasn't just college students but a mixed demographic so you know this place is good.

We ordered the Szechuan boiled fish fillet, stir-fried pea shoots, and sweet and spicy dumplings. I've been to Taiwan and have had dumplings there but I wasn't feeling the ones at Chengdu. Strike one: looked like a ravioli, strike two: weirdly sweet and filling wasn't particularly good, strike three: the skin was way too thick for my tastes.

One thing that I do have to mention was that the service was on the slower side. The restaurant wasn't super busy and the food came out pretty fast, but after they got the food out they were pretty slow at refilling water and getting us the check. 

Chengdu Gourmet is a bit hidden away from the other Squirrel Hill restaurants but it is worth the extra trip."}
{"text":"The best szechuan food I've had in the east coast! Reviews here are mostly revolving around their american/chinese menu, but the real value of the restaurant relies on their authentic szechuan menu. High quality ingredients, consistency in the cooking, mesmerizing Douban paste and the perfect balance of spiciness and numbness in their szechuan peppercorns. I would recommend to anyone willing to try real Szechuan cuisine"}
{"text":"Great food! No fuss, just lots of umami. We ordered three flaming pans (lamb, fish, mushroom) and what surprised me was each of the dishes had a distinct and unique flavour."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of other times in person since my first review and the food has been consistently very good.  I brought a friend with me once who had lived in China for a few years and he found the food to be authentic.  We also met one of the owners or mangers and found out he was from Chengdu, and he spoke to my friend in Chinese and they talked about the Chengdu area for a bit.  I'm also usually the only white person there, or the only one besides my friends I am with, so that's another good sign to me that it must be authentic.  We tried a large number of dishes and enjoyed everything.  The flaming pan dishes are fun to have at the table, as they have a flame underneath the serving dish to keep them hot.  I've only ordered off the traditional Sichuan menu so I can't speak to their more American Chinese offerings that they also have but I would definitely recommend their authentic Sichuan food if you enjoy spicy food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I've been sorely disappointed by every other Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, but this one is different. Really enjoyed the Sichuan spice palette, and the diversity of meat, vegetables, and starch. Spicy multi-mushrooms! Tiger skins! Dry-fried beans! Yum! The only slight bummer was a duck dish where the \"duck\" was 90% duck bone. Not bad, but not great. Everything else however, was definitely worth it. I'll be going there again, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Sorry, Yelpers, I have let you down.  I forgot to take my phone, so I did not take any pictures.  Nor do I remember exactly what we ate.  But this is what I can tell you: Chengdu was excellent!  The quality of the food matched what I'd had in San Francisco many years ago.  Chengdu had been on my list for several reasons.  One, a friend that lives in the neighborhood said it was the best restaurant in Squirrel Hill and that she had gone there with friends who had lived in Chengdu and they said that it was exactly like the food they'd eaten in Chengdu.  So that was reference #1.  Second was a relative who married in to a Taiwanese family suggested it.  Third was we assembled a small group of us who all love spicy, so we could go to Chengdu.  It would be lame to go there with one of the non-spice-eating relatives!  We were advised by said relatives to eat from the red (Sichuan) menu and mostly let them do the ordering, giving just a little input.  Rice is served individually per person.  We got to share:

Clod noodles.  Because I wanted to know what clod noodles were.  This is a lump of noodles served in a soy sauce that is more complex than your average.

Beef in cumin.  This is said relative's go-to dish.  My husband doesn't like meat too much, but this won him over.  The beef was tender and flavorful, and the cumin was so warm and complex.

Cabbage with chestnuts.  This was selected as a non-spicy foil.  It's served in a yellow sauce that looks and tastes a little like butter (relatives insist it's not butter but have no idea what it is).  The chestnuts are somewhere between crunchy and soft/chewy and really interesting.

Eggplant with garlic.  Spicy, melt-in-your mouth delicious.

Spicy fish in a flaming pot.  This is served over a little flaming contraption.  The fish was awesome but my favorite part was the potato-like root vegetable cut in strips in it.

Well, I guess I remembered everything.  It was all awesome!

So, here is my opinion of the spice level:  I think it is very approachable, personally.  I like spice, put hot sauce on some foods, but can't for example, handle something as crazy as habanero.  I did not eat any of the little red peppers in the food, and I found the spice to be enjoyable, papable, noticeable, but never overwhelming.  It wasn't unpleasant at any point to me.  My husband ate one red pepper and had to work to overcome it a little bit, nose running kind thing, but not too big of a deal.  So without eating the red peppers, it wasn't as spice-scary as people had made it out to be.

Like with any authentic Chinese restaurant, Chengdu is best if you go with a couple of people who are willing to share so that you can get a variety of dishes and eat lots of bits of things.  As for the price, it's not cheap, but not expensive.  With tax and tip, our bill for 4 people was about $70.   I would not have had as good of an experience if I had gone by myself or with just one person.  Go in a group!

I hardly every mention service, but I will say this: it was a surprise in an ethnic hole-in-the wall to have our waters refilled promptly.  So if that's important to you, maybe it will happen for you, too."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner tonight the service was good  the dish I had was good but it gave me the shits While i was waiting  for my order.I heard yelling in the back then a guy got up from a back table then the person was quiet before I was finished with my meal they brought me the check I don't like being rushed I WILL NOT GO BACK THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Chengdu and it came very quickly-- half an hour before the estimated arrival time. We ordered pan fried dumplings, pad Thai and honey walnut chicken. The dough on the dumplings was way too thick and dough--- overall super unpleasant, especially for $6.99. My significant other got the pad Thai and it was super weird tasting? It was really peppery and did not taste like standard pad Thai at all. We were really displeased  by it. The only saving grace was the honey walnut chicken which we ended up sharing. It was really good and actually had a lot of walnuts in it. So overall we were pretty unsatisfied with our lunch. Won't be ordering from here again.
P.S. we also asked for fortune cookies and soy sauce and didn't get any."}
{"text":"I accidentally wandered into this building in the late summer when it was still under construction. I was excited for a new place to get Szechuan style cuisine--and supposedly, the owner of this restaurant was the head chef at China Star at some point, so I had high expectations. I came on a Tuesday evening with a couple friends and the restaurant had at least six full tables--all but one group being Chinese. A good sign for those of us who are foreigners and looking for an authentic meal! 

We came with our friend who is Taiwanese, hoping that she would be able to tell us if the food was spot on or not. When we sat down, we were immediately given a plate of edamame to snack on, which was nice. My friend was delighted to see that they had Snow Pea Leaves on the menu, and though they are not in season right now, the dish was still available! So we got that, the Five Spice Beef, which is cold slices of beef shank, Three Pepper Chicken, and Double Cooked Smoky Pork Belly.

The five spice beef was great--the seasoning is Szechuan pepper, salt, and a few other spices I couldn't quite place. It came on the side and you had to sprinkle it on. It also came with a vinegary sauce that was very tasty. The snow pea leaves were insanely delicious--they were buttery, hearty, and possessed a mild brassica flavor. Probably now my favorite asian veggie dish! The pork belly was very tasty too; it came on a bed of sautéed leeks. However, this is the dish I would probably not order again because the pork belly was chewy and tough. Pork belly should not be chewy. The three pepper chicken was small pieces of fried chicken with bell pepper and some very hot red peppers. It was fantastic, though, there were way too many peppers and not as much chicken as we initially thought.

At the end of our meal they brought out a plate of sliced oranges! So great. Since no one even knows wtf fortune cookies are in China, it is super dumb when you get them at places that claim to be authentic. I also ordered a Taro milk tea at the end and that was also pretty good, but their tapioca pearls were kinda bad, all clumped up together and weird tasting.

Overall, I think that this restaurant has a lot of promise and much more variety than the Szechuan menus at How Lee and Sichuan Gourmet. BTW, this place is currently byob, so don't forget to get some good drinks if that's your thing. I wanted to give them five stars, since we had excellent service and the space is nice, but the food probably needs a little more tweaking until it is perfect! Congratulations on opening Chengdu Gourmet!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was as takeout Food from the American menu. I was not at all impressed; the General Tao chicken was very standard and the wonton soup was bland. 

However, on my second return, I ate at the restaurant and ordered from the Chinese menu. I was MUCH happier with my food. The service was very quick. Absolutely loved the sweet and soup tofu soup. Just be careful when ordering if spicy food isn't your thing! Will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place props but my experience there was very average. Having eaten at some other Chinese (though not Sichuan) restaurants in the area, I know there's better.

I confess I was with a group with dietary restrictions so I was not able to order the fundamentals of Sichuan (ok we could have ordered the green beans, fail!), but two of the dishes were so poor we didn't finish them.

The whole Sichuan fish was served in a spectacular dish with elephants and relatively edible but the fish was very low quality, I guess not unexpected given the inland location. I also enjoyed the shredded potatoes, which is indeed a tricky dish.

The \"pickled veggies\" weren't pickled at all and were drenched in worthless chile oil.

If you're ordering here play it safe and avoid anything that looks like it might be drenched in oil--I would stick with the sauteed stuff, maybe the cumin lamb and so on."}
{"text":"Best Szechaun Chinese i've had, hands down. Great service. Great prices. Get the dandan noodles and chili oil dumplings to start, then get the pork spare ribs in flaming pan. Order off the traditional Chinese menu."}
{"text":"This place is a must when you're in Pittsburgh. The traditional Szechuan menu is awesome, I've probably tried about 8 things, my favorites being from the \"flaming pot\" section."}
{"text":"I actually liked the food from here and would order often.  They had some pretty decent traditional dishes to choose from.  

However, last time we ordered delivery, we were informed the delivery person was refusing to come to our house despite being listed within their radius on Grub Hub (we are 2 miles from them).  We always tipped fairly well (15%-20%) and ordered about $200 worth of food a month.  It's a shame we won't be ordering from them any more."}
{"text":"Wow!  That's all I can say.  I fell in love with Sichuan food years ago, and its been one of my favorite cuisines ever since. I can't speak for the restaurants \"American\"  menu but I ordered from the Sichuan menu yesterday, and it was amazing.  We ordered take out. The restaurant was packed at 7pm, all tables full and about a dozen or so people waiting for tables, it was chaotic but organized.  My only disclaimer is that the review is only for the food, I didn't eat in!  Personally, the service would have to be atrocious for me to downgrade them a star because it was really that good.  I was told that the chef is the one who brought Sichuan cuisine to Pittsburgh, formerly working as the executive chef at China Star in the North Hills and later at Sichuan Gourmet in Squirrel Hill.  I like both of those restaurants, but I feel like I know why I thought they had gone down hill. I also think the fact that its his own restaurant has allowed him to explore his own creativity more.  We ordered the cold beef tendon appetizer,  cumin lamb, braised pork belly, tea smoked duck, and lamb chops.  Everything was delicious, spicy, garlicky, and mouth numbing just like Sichuan food is supposed to be.  I've eaten at Sichuan joints all over NYC, as well as the few local ones we have here, and this is hands down the best i've ever had.  Already organizing a group trip to eat there! Also BYOB!!"}
{"text":"Finally came here last night after a recommendation from a friend. You must order off of the Sichuan menu. I can't stop thinking about the unique  flavors from the meal and can't wait to return! We ordered the spicy cold chicken, rice balls in wine soup, wonton in red chili oil, and dan dan noodles with minced pork. Every single dish had a different, awesome flavor. I was weary about trying cold chicken with bones in, but I it's definitely a must try. The flavors were spicy, cilantro-y, and salty. Even my friend that \"hates cilantro\" loved it. The rice balls were filled with bean curd and had a sweet flavor with a wine after taste served in a cold broth. The wontons were in a spicy oil that had a sweet flavor. The dan dan noodles were also fantastic. I would definitely order all of these items again, but I can't wait to try everything else they have! My friend highly recommended the water spinach, but we didn't get a chance to try it. For the price and quality, this is one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. 

We got the chicken and spicy fish fillet (sorry, don't remember exact titles). I noticed that the seasoning was a little sweeter, so it was an interesting taste. The food came out pretty quickly but I feel like for the amount of food, it's overpriced. The fish dish was $16.99! Two dishes ended up being around $30, and I feel like that's a lot for the amount/quality of food. 

Another thing is that the place is kind of run down, some of the booths are broken and there are flies inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious.   Authentic.  Nice service.  Will return.    Really among the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Questionable meat handling practices. Don't risk it. Not the cleanest and disagreements in food presentation have lead me to look elsewhere. I like my batter fried shrimp to not have shells, and legs, and heads. 
Don't be fooled by seemingly exotic ingredients as an indicator or authenticity."}
{"text":"If I can give zero star, I would.
We ordered Chinese spicy pot and the quail eggs in it stank (I've been eating quail egg as I grow up, so I can tell if it was bad). The smell was sooo strong and I had to spit out. Then I had the waitress ask the cook and let them smell it. They said it was just the original tastes of quail egg! What a blunt lie! I really cannot believe it!

After my friends and me got home, we ran to bathroom immediately. Out belly hurt soooo bad.

There are two very good Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. I would definitely recommend people go to Sichuan gourmet and How Lee. I've been to those restaurants for more than 20 times and nothing went wrong. 

WE WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This looked like a good place to have a meal on a rainy day, so we stopped by for lunch today. The menu is extensive; it seems to cater to customers who want an authentic dining experience as well as those who are looking for more Americanized Chinese food (example: the family next to us ordered chicken & broccoli, General Tso's chicken, and dumplings, although there's nothing wrong with that!). It's great that the menu was organized, clean, and colorful with high quality images of menu items to help you choose what you want. We ordered the diced spicy chicken, pork belly, and green beans. They got our first milk tea order wrong so we got an extra one for free (yay). The spicy chicken was at the perfect level of spiciness--we had asked for it to be a little less spicy, but not sure if it actually was--and was very flavorful. The pork belly (basically bacon because it was so thin) was decent. The green beans were a little different from what I'm used to; they were crunchier than usual and I felt that the flavor was off. Portions were good and our server was nice. Chengdu Gourmet offers a lot of variety; there's something for everyone, so don't be afraid to come with a more diverse group.

{"text":"Huge menu and low prices on very good fare. But this is not PF Chang's and the food is not Americanized--sauteed pork kidneys anyone? It is also not death by salt as can be the case at PFC.

Restaurant feels more like something in Chinatown in NYC than in Squirrel Hill and is has a interesting facade and old school decorum.
 
But if you are adventurous and like spicier food this is worth a try."}
{"text":"The food here is good and spicy. It is really spicy, not the fake spicy you might get from an American-chinese restaurant. We ordered a couple different dishes, beef, chongqing chicken,  mapo tofu, green beans and a couple appetizers.  All the food choices were excellent, the service so-so. Restaurants really should limit cell phone use. The waitresses were all deeply involved in their phones. Even when we took the lid off of the tea pot and put it into their view they didn't notice until I stood up with the tea pot in my hand.  Once the place got busy,  the waitresses didn't have time to use their phones and service actually improved."}
{"text":"Loved it!

I've never been to China but this is what I always envisioned authentic Chinese food to taste like. They have two menus but we skipped the American version and went straight to the traditional menu. 

We consider ourselves pretty adventurous but this menu challenged that. Tripe and tongue don't really interest me but beef in hot spicy sauce - sign me up!  The veggies in this dish were awesome but the beef was so-so (hence, only 4 stars). We also had the Chinese broccoli which was very good. That was more than enough for two hungry adults with enough left over to make a lunch for one. 

Kids had soup and rice so they were happy. We will definitely be back. 

Note that this place is next to a bowling alley so don't be surprised at the sounds you may hear."}
{"text":"Went here right after the Chinese New Year performance so we walked here from the Jewish Community Center. It's kind of a hike b/c it's not on Murray Ave or Forbes Ave like the rest of the restaurants in Squirrel Hill. So yeah, location is really out of the way and not too scenic. It's right by a gas station and a busy intersection. Also, if you like hearing thuds and booms and feeling vibrations every 20 seconds, this is the place for you. It shares a wall with the bowling alley next door and made for an awful eating environment. 

Only chose this spot b/c I loved Sichuan Gourmet so much and figured it was going to be very similar. Ambiance and decor did not match up to Sichuan Gourmet. The waitstaff were friendly enough young ladies, but not very attentive. That one waiter at Sichuan Gourmet was super nice and attentive! 
Taste--well, it was still pretty good, but the presentation and portion size were both lacking. The chicken in the clay pot dish was minuscule and had no veggies like its picture. The chicken was not tender enough and the sauce was a bit too sweet. So...better than take out Chinese food but not the greatest for the prices they charge. The cheapest entree was like $13 and they don't include any veggies with their meat dishes."}
{"text":"the best chinese restaurant i have ever been. They are not American chinese food. The are professional."}
{"text":"We came here late Saturday night around 9:30pm and I was surprised they were going to be open until 11! The staff were attentive to fill our waters and take our orders. The bowling alley is right above so you can hear some of that noise in the restaurant. We ordered egg rolls, pan fried dumplings, and general tso's chicken. 

Egg rolls were extremely hot in temperature and had a bit of shrimp in it, which isn't specified on the menu. They were decent 3.5/5. 

The pan fried dumplings were a bit chewy because the ratio of dumpling to meat was off. The dumpling dough was a bit thick for my liking and it came off as chewy. These were also decent 3/5.

General Tso's chicken was the best part. While I personally would want it with a bit more spice, the chicken was covered in sauce and soft to eat. This also comes with a bowl of white rice. 4/5.

Overall I would say this place is a 3.5/5 but went with the 4 stars because of service and how fast we got our food."}
{"text":"I used to get Chinese food all the time. I think back in my college days specifally. Nothing tasted better than a greasy tub of lo mein noodles. Loaded with veggies and shrimp. 

I used to get it all the time from Mandarin Gourmet or Fui Lai downtown. You know the places, very different, but both very good (or good from what I remember). So I was pumped to go back to my fave dish. 

While it wasn't terrible by any means, it lacked flavor. Plus, the shrimp that I did get was minuscule and I'd guess there were maybe 5 pieces. I also love bean sprouts and cabbage in there, and there was hardly any at all. And forget about any sugar snap peas or broccoli. I guess maybe that was always a bonus when there was veggies in lo mein at other restaurants. 

I think this might spur another resurgence of the hunt for the best Chinese in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"My brother and I went to Chengdu Gourment Christmas day during the evening.  It was nice that they were open during Christmas.  Then again, it seems that most Asian restaurants are open.  For our appetizer, we got the Scallion Pancakes.  It was very good because it was very crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  For our main dishes, we got the Spicy Fish Fillet in Flaming Pan and a Pork Belly dish where I can't remember the exact name of it.  They were both excellent.  The Fish Fillet was fried and crispy on the outside, and succulent and juicy on the inside.  The spicy components of dish really put the fillet on another level.  The pork belly dish was great as well and its spiciness also got the pork belly to go to another level.

The service though could be better.  The waiter only went back to our table only once to refill our drinks.  Then even after we were done, we still had to wait 20 minutes to get our check.  We could gave the waiter his attention, but he should have recognized that we were done eating and asked if we wanted our check.  Owners of Chengdu Gourmet, please review with your staff on making sure they give customers the appropriate attention.

That being said, I would definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Fresh, still warm, good quality ingredients, full portions. Very tasty! I'd definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Have you been to Sichuan Gourmet just up the street on Murray Ave? This place was opened by one of their chefs. Endless menu of massive hyper-intense items, and reasonable prices, but with even more flavor and choices. 

I always got the spicy fish, and my wife always got the mapo tofu so we were psyched to see this place had them together as a single dish, score!

Sadly, the ambiance leaves something to be desired. The restaurant is just as scorching as their food.  The old ceiling fans are no match for their hot kitchen and hotter peppers.  Florescent lighting, walls with faded paint, and old carpet, don't do the food justice. 

The wait staff is extraordinarily fast and attentive.  I'd give a well deserved A+ for a menu chock full of spicy chinese goodness and service.  Just get some air conditioners and modernize the interior and this will be the last restaurant I ever need."}
{"text":"Amazing Sichuan food in Squirrel Hill. I mostly get delivery, and they are fast and friendly. My favorite is the chicken dish that is shown in the profile pic. It's very spicy and seasoned with ginger, garlic and red peppers and SO good. There are two versions of their menu: American and Chinese. I'm an adventurous eater, so I usually order off the Chinese, but certain items are on both, such as the Mapo Tofu- yum! I've found my go-to Chinese place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We got delivery from these guys on Xmas Day and while they were so friendly and nice, the food was just OK. But they do have an expansive menu, and we appreciated their service."}
