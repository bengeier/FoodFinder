{"text":"This place made me fall in love with pho all over again. The meat, the noodles, the broth, all were delicious and cooked perfectly. The spring rolls were superb too. And despite their being very busy the service was excellent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is located on the edge of Chinatown in Montreal and has a lot of foot traffic.  We went in based on the Yelp review.  We had their recommend Pho and was below average on taste.  The portion was OK.  The fried meat was better than the Pho.  I do not recommend this place if you want a good bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"One word: Yum.  This place is great... I got the mince pork roll... they were ok but mostly lettuce. However the #12 (grilled beef with imperial rolls) was delicious. It was all very light but still filling. And dirt cheap... good food+great prices= recipe for success"}
{"text":"I am a Pho enthusiast and had really high hopes for the first time stepping in into Pho Bang NY. There was a bit of a line-up but thats expected on a Sat. night. Initially My girl friend and I were seated on a table for 4. Then when a crew of 4 people arrived after us- we were asked to change seats. Then after ordering our food- we were asked once again to move our seats- this time in a corner in the most inconvenient spot. Basically in 15 minutes we had sat on 3 tables. When I tried to tell the waiter that this is not right- he did not seem to care. We didn't wait for our food and told the manager that we are leaving- at which point he had the nerve to ask us to pay for the food as it was being prepared. We simply went across the street to  Pho Bac 97 and got prompt RESPECTFUL service. Even though I've heard good things about food- I will never eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is amazing. I went to Vietnam and I can tell you the food here is just as amazing!  The ambiance is typical vietnamese. I will come back for more food for sure."}
{"text":"...At first glace, the soup at Pho Bang New York was dark and murky that went from transparent clean-cut, all business soup up top, to cloudy, mysterious and all party near the bottom - I present to you, the Soup Mullet..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this restaurant following the reviews on Yelp, but we were both underwhelmed. The pho broth was bland, the portions were small, and there were way too many tables packed into the restaurant than what is comfortable or even manageable. For a comparable price, I would suggest that you try Pho Saigon Vietnam, which is maybe a three minute walk north. Their servings are more generous, the soup is much more flavourful, and there is much more space to sit and actually enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Ate here twice during our stay in Montreal.  Very busy place so I took that as a good sign.  Overall the soup was good but it was a bit confusing with the ordering and what types of meat were in each dish.  What my wife ordered looked very different than the picture on the menu.  I liked it as well as our usual Pho place in Toronto but not as well as our favorites in New York or San Francisco.  I would recommend it, not outstanding but quite good."}
{"text":"Good big bowls of pho at a great price with super friendly staff. One of my favs to go in Montreal."}
{"text":"Well although quite tasty I must admit dirt is a part of the decor. The wait staff were not rude just cold. Probably better places to go!"}
{"text":"Best Pho ever !!! I wish I'm kidding. Reasonable price, perfectly (and generously) portioned and DELICIOUS !!!!! Ten thumbs up - cannot say enough anout this place. We went there 3 times while we're visiting Montreal which was 3 day-plan ! lol  Worth it!  Loved Pho and Chicken and beef barbecue - soooooooooooooo good."}
{"text":"Food: Pho at a very average quality, the broth is salty but lacks beef flavor, very bland... although the meat has been well cooked but it lacks flavor as well, and only few pieces of meat covering mountain of noodles...  Service: The staff are not very friendly for the few occasions I've been, I saw them chasing down customers for tips as they were walking out the door... (I thought tips were optional... O.o)  Price: A little expensive due to its location I guess  Ambiance: Bright, fairly big, mostly long tables that you have to share with other customers. Usually fairly crowded but still manage to look pretty clean~"}
{"text":"Pho was good - I was satisfied but wasn't the best or worse that I ever had.  The soup had a good amount of MSG (it's hat slightly sweet tingly sensation on the tongue followed by bloating).  It wasn't heavily used but be forewarned if you are sensitive.  Broth was flavorful but too clear (you need some cloudiness as it's a sign that they cooked it overnight with all the goodies).  The big positive for the soup is that they used very good quality beef (some people take this for granted).  And the sides were there (yay! Chili peppers! I don't eat them but I miss seeing them as restaurants tend to skip them).  And the rolls (both fried and fresh) were perfect.  The service sort of sucked and make sure to check your bill as several people had mistakes (new cashier maybe?). The place was pretty clean and spacious so maybe geared towards tourists (great Asian food is usually in hole in the walls).  Overall it hit the spot but I would keep looking for good pho.  It's quality is slightly better or equivalent to New York pho but no where near the quality of pho in Minneapolis/DC/San Fran/OC/Dallas.  And here's to clarify a few things: Fried rolls = cha Gio = \"egg rolls\" in Midwest = \"spring rolls\" everywhere else ... and only in New York area do they use rice paper wrappers (not wonton wrappers like they do here which is so much better) to make the roll  Fresh rolls = gui coun = \"spring rolls\" in Midwest = \"summer rolls\" everywhere else"}
{"text":"We went on a really rainy day and so the place was hopping (because pho and rain go hand-in-hand, of course!) and service was super quick. We agreed that the pho was pretty good and portion size excellent but you have to pay extra for those meat balls (what is in them?!) that you sometimes want in your pho so that's a bummer! But I'd say it's pretty tasty! I also tried the rainbow drink (green, red, yellow) with coconut milk, red bean, indiscernible green spaghetti-like jellies and yellow something. It was tasty!!  Would return on another rainy day for sure :)"}
{"text":"In general the Pho is not bad: the vermicelli is standard but the soup is a little too salty for me. Price for all food is cheap and the service is typically Chinatown service."}
{"text":"Based on the typical pho place Pho Bang is well above average. The soup tastes fresh and not as greasy or MSG drenched like other places. The basil they use is different from the typical pho place in being very potent and makes the soup taste so much better. Dining room is your typical vietnamese restaurant, not immaculately clean but not filthy either. This place is really busy but the wait is pretty short and the food comes out almost immediately. Their appetizers and noodle bowls are just mediocre so if you come here definitely order the pho."}
{"text":"Pho (tonkinoise soup) and fried rice are couple of those Asian staples that are not easy to screw up. Any montreal Pho  restaurant will serve up pretty decent Pho even by HCM city standards. What separates a decent Pho from an excellent Pho is the broth and the key meat (or chicken) add-In. Pho bang NY scores high on the consistency, richness and clarity of broth, scores a bit low on saltiness scale (definite MSG presence), but scores super high on the quality of Chicken (didn't try beef or pork variations) add-ins.  At $10 all-in for a large bowl Pho, it's hard not to have a content smile as one steps out of PBNY on a rainy and cold Montreal summer afternoon."}
{"text":"As a \"Pho fan\", I know by heart all the Pho restaurants in Montreal.  And this one, is particurarly a good one :  - the spring rolls are excellent, the best i ever had in MTL  - the Pho Soup is delicious  - the service is ok but the only \"bad\" thing is that you have to pay only in cash"}
{"text":"Best pho I have had, which say a lot for me since I'm from Los Angeles area and eat a lot of pho there. We went during the peak of lunch time and it got packed within 5 minutes. Waiting line out the door! We got the beef noodle soup with added beef ball... Delicious. Also ordered the grilled beef and chicken combo  with rice. It came with fish sauce for dipping. It was quite good.  Meat was tender and tasty. Total paid was 30$ for the 3 of us  cash only! But they accepted US$. This was a good first impression of the food to be found in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Hi!! I just went there today! And it was soo good! Does anyone know about those cold drinks..?"}
{"text":"The best meal in Montreal ever! And it's authentic Vietnamese cuisine. I would go back to Montreal for have this again!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho! A great perk is the free tea. Only complaint is they are cash only & do not have a vegetarian broth. Extremely flavorful & cheap. You can leave satisfied for under 10$... Including tip :) Delicious pho! A great perk is the free tea. Only complaint is they are cash only & do not have a vegetarian broth. Extremely flavorful & cheap. You can leave satisfied for under 10$... Including tip :)"}
{"text":"Pho bang has the most delicious Vietnamese soups I have ever tried. The service is super fast and friendly. The ambiance is great with a decorated ceiling and classical music. The only flaw to this place is that they only take cash. Besides that it's a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Regular pho. Spring rolls were a disappointment. Staff was nice though. Clean washrooms."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the Pho here on our visit to Montreal.  We both agreed it was pretty damn tasty.  I guess we didn't know what to expect, but we've always been disappointed when trying Pho in other cities, especially ones with low vietnamese population.  The broth was flavorful, and full of the great beefy pho flavor.  If I had to nit, I thought they threw in way too much white onions.  Perhaps it's a french thing, but I didn't enjoy that aspect of the Pho as much.  Other than that, go here for pho if you're in Montreal, and looking for something other than French food!"}
{"text":"God above, the craving I get! I love Pho Bang for their no-nonsense approach to food: minimal glitz and maximum grub.   A restaurant with a dish for a name excels at that dish in particular, therefore my fare at Pho Bang is, you guessed it, pho.  Ten bucks a head earns you a large bowl of generously meaty pho, two spring rolls and unlimited green tea. It hardly gets any better.  At busy times there can be quite a wait and you will be crammed against strangers. I like it. I'd trade separate tables and a wine encyclopedia for great prices and portions any day.   Throughput and turnover are fast, and the service is attentive. The few staff they have care about their customers greatly and it shows. The very few times I noticed I was waiting (maximum 15 minutes), catching a rushing waiter's eye was all that was needed to be approached.  Particularly on cold days, a bowl of steaming pho loaded with goodness is all you need. Come to Pho Bang and you will leave a happy person. My tip: sit a little away from the door when it's cold outside, as some people seem unable to grasp the concept of closing one before opening the other."}
{"text":"great vermicelli noodle bowl with grilled & shredded pork, spring rolls were nice, would definitely eat here again, but service was very rushed and inconsistent - we could not get their attention to ask for anything once our dishes were served."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious vermicelli I've ever had.  I like vermicelli bowls (usually dry rice noodles, shredded cucumber, carrot, bean sprouts, peanuts, fish sauce, topped with BBQ meat and spring roll) but this was different.  I couldn't stop eating these noodles.  There was something special about them.  Addictive.  Sounds sinister, but I have a suspicion they add butter to them.  Most rice vermicelli noodles in Toronto are bland until you add fish sauce.  These noodles were very rich tasting!  Service was \"meh\", hurried and not too friendly.  Dining room is mostly communal tables, so be prepared to share the same table with a bunch of strangers.  Prices are higher than Toronto.  Vietnamese food in Toronto tends to go by size (sml, med, lrg, xlrg). The prices in Montreal reflect one size, and it's pretty large.  Still...I would go back for another hit of those buttery rice noodles."}
{"text":"There's really nothing special about the pho. The beef was full of fat and there was very little noodle in my broth. My friend had a beef platter and the meat was so thin, we just were satisfied. The beef wasn't marinated before being cooked. We had to dip everything in the fish sauce they have just to get some flavor in there. The waiter was very friendly and the wait was very short. It's okay for a quick bite but when I left, I was still craving something more."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty and the service was good.  We went for a late lunch after having tried to go there for dinner the previous evening.  The place was packed with a waiting line out the door.  Not worth the wait so go for a late lunch or early dinner.  They only take cash so have your Canadian dollars handy because their ATM machine charges a rather steep fee."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday and I had a good meal.  I think the prices are pretty good.  My friend got a vermicelli bowl (grilled chicken and beef).  I had the Pho (raw meat with flanc) and it was pretty good.  The grilled meat was delicious.  My soup was very good.  The broth could have been a little more tastier.  I think i prefer Pho Lien over Pho Bang, but not by much :)  Service was fast and the place is crowded."}
{"text":"Excellente soupe . Attention le bouillon des tonkinoises est a base de buf et non pas de poulet . Essayer la soupe avec poulet grillé . Une des meilleures a Montréal . L'endroit est très propre et les serveurs sont très courtois . Les toilettes sont spécialement super propres et modernes . J'enlève une étoile parce que c'est particulièrement achalandé et pour la disposition des tables ."}
{"text":"Great place! Usually go here when I am in chinatown. Go give this a try! Pho is always good here and other rich/noodle dishes. mmmm pho. Only thing is this place is usually pretty packed during rush hours.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love Vietnamese Food.  Food and service are good.  The women at the counter, who takes the money is rude and totally not hospitable.  Chicken and Beef with rice, with fish sauce delicious.  Great place is you want to stop in for some quick food and quick service."}
{"text":"Great food great price. Also great service. Try the spring rolls Best Meal and price for a meal in Montreal"}
{"text":"This place was very busy on a Monday night. I would say this is a 3.5. We ordered the pork chop with pho noodle soup( I didn't want the raw beef) and they were able to accommodate. Pork chop with rice and a plain pho noodle soup without any meat. I would say that everything was just perfect and hit the right spot after  a long walk in old Montreal."}
{"text":"Spring rolls? GREAT  Pho? Not the best but acceptable. Broth wasn't as rich as a lot of others like it to be but still was okay in my opinion and will hit the spot for ya.  Dropped by around an hour before closing and although there were a bunch of people still there I was surprised that they were cleaning already.  Service wasn't bad and was like every other asian establishment in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was not bad at all. It wasnt great, but was ok.   Service was horrible. First of all, they made us to share a table with strangers without asking.  The short guy who speaks English was horrible. I've never had a waiter like him in my whole life. His attitude was just HORRIBLE.    When the situation that he need to say Excuse ME because one of my friend was accidently blocking on his way to serve, he said \"chuchuchuchu\" instead. When he asked us if we are ready to order, we pause like 3 second before we replied. He didn't wait 3 second and just walked away. When we had to wait over 20 min for meal, he's never checked our table so we had to ask the other waiter. When we asked him if they have a bubble tea later, he walked away without answering. I guess it means NO???   It was just horrible experience there. They ruind our new years day! We should go the other Vietnamese place next door. We won't go back Pho Band!!!! I wish the waiter read this review. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been in Montreal, Waiter served us was so rude, refused to serve when he didn't think our order were enough for three, When we were there it's almost 9pm, more then half of restaurant were empty, after we explained my husband and I already ate, we just kept our son company who was hungry, but we will pay for tea and we also order spring rolls. But Waiter still insists if we don't order more, he won't serve us, we felt so insulted and left, I will never go back ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Service  This is as good as it gets at an asian restaurant. The restaurant is packed and busy, I would have to say if anything this is on the high end of asian restaurant service. There was a line out the door when I arrived, but we were seated shortly after. It's a big restaurant and it's not a place where people sit and chat after, so turnover is fairly quick. The wait has more to do with the fact that the servers are working at a 100km/hr so it's just finding time for someone to clean the table you're going to sit at and seat you.   Food I order the classic beef pho, which I thought you could not screw up. I ordered a small at $8 worried that I wouldn't have enough food, but thank god I only ordered a small. $8 for a filling meal is not expensive, for Pho it's on the higher end as it is not generally an expensive dish. The pho was not good - they used wrong type of beef and the whole dish was just tasteless despite all the oil on the surface of the broth. Normally, the beef in pho is the thinly cut half raw beef that is similar to hot pot, instead I got thick chunky pieces of meat that were cooked through and through that you would normally find in leftover chinese soups or congee.   I also ordered a side of a spring roll, this was terrible. Honestly, I can't even describe it as I tried to push the memory out of my brain. It wasn't worth the $4 and again it was rather tasteless even with the fish sauce.   If you're looking for a healthy meal, you've probably found it at Pho Bang."}
{"text":"I've only tried the PHO which is delicious but my people say that the other dishes are even better. Gotta go back trying."}
{"text":"Had the Bun Bo Hue here. Tasted like it was heavily adjusted for Western palettes and so I didn't like it very much. Also be prepared to wait in line if you come in a big group on weekends."}
{"text":"The pho is out of this world. Other stuff not quite as good. Service kind of absent-minded. But really it's all about the pho, which is spectacular and absurdly cheap."}
{"text":"Service fast but sometimes not so friendly. The dining room is always busy and you might have to share the long tables with strangers. But the food is good, generous and very comforting. It's close to work and I think it's one of my favorite place in Chinatown for a quick lunch during working days. I also live near Pho Thay Ho which is my ultimate best, but Pho Bang New York is without a doubt my number #2."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho you can find in Chinatown. Their weekend special spicy soup is extremely delicious, although slightly more pricey than other options. The service is somewhat slow, mainly because there are always so many customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I always look forward to the weekend for their special spicy broth noodle bun bo hue and their dessert drink with tapioca. Always busy but clean and well lit. The waiters are really friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Vietnamese I have had anywhere. To be clear, we didn't actually order pho, we had vermicelli bowls with grilled meats. My chicken, steak and shrimp were cooked so perfectly; they were full of that yummy grilled flavor. The vermicelli was good and with the addition of duck sauce and a touch of chili sauce for me, I thought it was one of the best meals I have had in a while and so well-priced.  We also had a vietnamese cafe au lait which my husband reminded me meant that it came with sweetened condensed milk. I was a little nervous that it wouldn't be sweet enough for me (I'm a splenda addict), but it was just perfect. As it was literally 0 degrees F out, I was thrilled to have it.  I thought our server was friendly, it came out in good time, but not so fast that you felt like it had been sitting around. All in all: completely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pho in a clean atmosphere.  I love this place.  I've driven over an hour just to eat lunch here.  Real cold by the door in winter."}
{"text":"This place gives a good name to Vietnamese food. It's clean and satisfying!!! I got the vermicelli bowl with beef&chicken. I am dying to come back here with my mom because I know she's going to love it. It's also a plus that they serve you a soothing tea"}
{"text":"Bang bang and I'm in pho goodness here. If you're hungry, get the extra large serving. However, with any size, you will get a nice, clean broth full of flavor and meats. I only wish they would separate the raw meats on a separate platter as putting it in the same broth all at the same time means as some point, I'm eating cooked meat anyways. However, they do give you a lot of meat and tripe, so I'm just being picky  Finish it off with an iced coffee with condensed milk and you are good to go."}
{"text":"One of my first Montreal pho attempts after Pho Nam Do closed was with Pho Bang New York. I had read some good reviews on Zomato (formerly Urbanspoon) as well as on MTLBlog. Plus, it was only a 15 mins bus ride from where I used to live. I went a few times, but never loved their pho. I always thought the broth was missing some key flavors.   For my full MTL Pho Hunt review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"Cela faisait des années que je n'y étais pas allée.  Et bien, je n'ai pas été déçue de ce délicieux voyage culinaire. J'ai plongé dans la soupe de boeuf. Oh! Quel délice. Petit ajout: les rouleaux impériaux, j'avoue c'est mon péché mignon. C'est tellement bon, accompagné d'un petit thé vert au jasmin. Rien que d'y penser j'en ai l'eau à la bouche. C'est décidé j'y retourne cette semaine. Délicieusement votre."}
{"text":"Came here on a recent visit to Montreal.  I always like to try Vietnamese food in different countries to see the different interpretations.  Our group of four shared the egg rolls which were good - hard to mess up anything deep fried though! We also had bowls of pho and vermicelli.  I think all were solid choices but nothing spectacular.  I highly recommend the che ba mau, which is a sort of dessert/drink dish (hard to describe).  It was delicious and just as my mom makes it!  However, the service here wasn't too great, and it's too bad, because that's what I end up remembering.  The waiter looked pretty glum, and we had to ask for water 3 times before it arrived!"}
{"text":"This place got me hooked on bun, now I want more. Also, the price was right, the service was okay and there was free tea involved."}
{"text":"Although it has an odd name, this place is nestled in the heart of Montreal's tiny Chinatown. There are a few other Vietnamese places along this stretch of on St. Laurent but Pho Bang NY seemed to be the busiest.  They have some of the best Pho soup and crispy spring rolls I've ever had.   The soup broth was on par with my favourite Pho place back home (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-hung-toronto#hrid:wCB8Ps3GDDB3UV_IO9WshA) but the rolls were the best I've ever ordered at a Vietnamese restaurant.  If you're hungry and want some good eats for cheap, come here. BRING CASH. Don't be indecisive with your order because they get impatient and want a quick turn over on the table since they usually have lineups to get in."}
{"text":"Here's a New York perspective (coming from someone who has easy access to Viet food in NYC) of this place.  In Montreal's Chinatown where you easily have 5+ Viet restaurants along 1 street, this place surely stands out based on the crowds it attracts (plus above average Yelp reviews). Because there's multiple Pho Bang in NY itself, I'm not sure if this is linked at all.  PHO BO VIEN (beef balls) - Excellent clear broth, but the  flavor profile isn't as strong, but it can be fixed with sriracha and hoisin sauce. Very mild complaint. I'm not as thirsty afterwards so I'm assuming no MSG was added.  SPRING ROLLS - Not as good to what I'm used to. Smaller/ more skinny, wrapped and fried with an egg roll type wrapper instead of a rice paper. Rare occurrence, but Kudos to them offering a vegetarian version for non-meat eaters though.   Rice Vermicelli with Grilled Pork (thit nuong) - Wifey ordered it and it was probably the most balanced dish I've had in a while in terms of tender and flavor of the meat.   I cant judge this place against the other neighboring restaurants, but this seems to be a solid Montreal standard. Turnover was quick on a crowded Friday evening. Cleanliness is hard to find in traditional Viet restaurants, but this place is relatively clean. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Terrible. And rude service was simply salt in the wound. Take my advice and walk past, plenty of better places closer by."}
{"text":"If I'm eating pho in Montreal, this is where it's going down.   Proper broth, balanced flavors,  tasty grilled chicken on cold noodles also...    Don't ask too many questions or bother with the place next door. This is the one."}
{"text":"I got the number 1 (combo) extra large. Overall, the broth is a bit on the bland side with stronger hints of licorice and peppercorn. The noodles were a bit short of the ideal elastic texture. For a combo, the meat combo was lacking in that there was little tripe, no tendon and no meatball.  The place is cleaner than the average pho restaurant. If you prefer a lighter broth, this place might be for you. If you prefer a stronger, sweeter broth, try some of the other places down the street."}
{"text":"Pho was pretty good and drinks were as well. It was good and fast service, staff was friendly and speedy.   The place is like a cafeteria style where you sit with strangers, smart move to get more people in and out. This is a pretty good pho place and I've been to many in Toronto. Price was standard for Pho. We all had a good time here. Would go back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Il ne faut pas se fier à l'ambiance et au décors. Meilleure soupe vietnamienne à Montréal. Le bouillon est plein de saveurs, beaucoup de légumes et la viande + fruits de mer sont délicieux. Les rouleaux frits sont très bons et le service est super rapido ! C'est le meilleur endroit pour manger rapidement quelque chose de réconfortant et de bon pour la santé."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, we did not dine in, we ordered takeaway to take back to our hotel room. However, the place was packed and service was fast and the pho was under $7. It was fresh and the broth was not salty. The gold thing is they give you all the extras on the side and are nice enough to give more if needed. We ordered the spring rolls and their delicious! I ordered the pho with flank steak and the meat was tender. Pay cash only, they do not take card."}
{"text":"Loyal customer since they were right on the corner of Viger and St-Laurent. The decor is strange, but the food is generous in portions and the food is super tasty."}
{"text":"Best pho we've ever tried...broth is spicy and delicious along with spring rolls. Must check out and will def be back!"}
{"text":"Alright alright... this is one of those places with horrible service but awsome food that I love to go but not sure how to rate it.   Pro: Personaly, I think it's the best pho in Montreal.  Con: Service eg: We were three, the place was half filled it was around 4pm, and the waiter gave us 1 menu. One menu for three people...like why bruh. However, they is one dude who's really nice, if he's not there, expect the other guy who doesn't even try to speak to you, do prepare to use sign language with him.   In the end, I'm giving it 3/5, because althought the food is top notch, you can't receive a full mark for inconsistent services."}
{"text":"It's so obvious where the best pho is on the block... This place is jam packed while others were less than half occupied!    I love the seating arrangement here. You're eating close to and right along with total strangers. It's hard not to make friends when you're all happily slurping up a hot bowl of pho. Don't be scared... Tip the bowl and drink it up!  I've had pho maybe a half a dozen times in different cities. I'm a noob still, but this was the best I've had so far. It will be hard to find better. The broth, the fresh veggies, the very well seasoned shrimp... Eating pho is an experience. Eating it here is almost cosmic.   Cash only!  ATM located inside."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my mom.  My mom loves pho and this place got her seal of approval!  This was our last meal in Montreal during our fun getaway, and was a great ending to a wonderful trip.  My mom had the Special Pho (size small) $8.50.  It had rare beef, cooked beef and tripe.  She was a bit disappointed that it didn't have beef meatballs, but she was very happy that they were generous with the meat and the beef was not sliced razor-thin like at some places.  She said the broth was flavourful and the pho here is comparable to places in Toronto.  I had the grilled beef and spring roll vermicelli ($10.50).  It was fantastic.  The beef was so flavourful.  It had just a hint of sweetness which made it delicious.  They were not stingy with the meat; I got a lot.  I could eat that beef all day long!  The spring rolls were just ok though.  They had ground pork, vermicelli and carrots in them.  They were crispy, but lacked any wow factor.  My dish came with shredded iceberg lettuce on the bottom (I'm not usually a fan of iceberg, but this is the usual lettuce for this dish and the crunchiness of iceberg is needed to contrast the softness of the vermicelli), pickled carrots and pickled daikon.  I was a bit disappointed that there weren't any slivered cucumbers.  Oh, it came with cilantro sprinkled on top, but I picked them out immediately (even before I took the photo).  There were a few green onions and crushed peanuts on top too.  This dish was super tasty overall, and I would order it again (except I might skip the spring rolls and get a second meat, like grilled chicken).  The server was really polite and efficient.  We got our food super fast.  Now the tables are all pushed together in rows.  We ate around 4pm on a weekday so it wasn't packed, so we didn't have anyone else next to us, but when it get busy, you might have to sit next to strangers.  Washrooms are downstairs and were really clean.     I would come back, but probably only at non-peak hours again, because I wouldn't want to sit with strangers, lol."}
{"text":"We have been here several times over the last few years... it's good, in past. Last night my daughter had a 20.00 US bill and asked when entering if she could use it. She was told yes the exchange would 1.20.  Service by a young lady, looked like newer employee was non existent. We asked for water twice, never got.  Food was ok, rushed, looked like someone threw it in the plate. When my daughter paid for her 13.50 plate and gave the 20.00 US bill, she was haven 5.00 in coins and brushed off with a quick 'good bye' by the same server at the cash register.   When she was told that the change should be based on 24.00$, afterall they had said upon entering that the US bill was ok, and would be a 1.20 exchange.  The young woman at the cash counter said she didn't understand and kept the other guests waiting. It was not a pleasant end to dinner!! It took my daughter several minutes to get her correct change!!!  It appeared the server wanted to pocket the change.  Teach your employees to count, and if they can't understand what a customer is saying, don't have them work the cash counter.  When someone chooses to come and spend their money at your Resto., be nice to them and listen when the customer is saying they are being short changed!   We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy pho with acceptable service. Despite the prime location prices are reasonable. Plus, they didn't kick us out when my friend asked if they had general tsos!"}
{"text":"After eating greasy food for days, this was the most delicious, comforting food that we could find near our hotel. I didn't know how crazy packed it was compared to other location after walking around Chinatown.  The restaurant is small so expect to be seated with other people in the same table! Vietnamese style. It's hard to get to your servers once you order because they're always busy running around so make sure to ask for anything while ordering as well!  STUFF I WOULD GET  |#1- Pho Dac Biec| $8 for small $9 for large $10 for x-large Honestly, I'm not much of a pho person myself so even if it was bad, I wouldn't have known. But the food taste delicious to me though. All pho taste the same actually. I guess I just don't eat enough to differentiate or care about it.   |#13 - Rice with grilled pork| $13 OHHH YUMMYLICIOUS!! After not eating rice for a few days, I was mad craving for this! I wish it was broken rice instead of just rice but it was good nonetheless! The grilled pork was so tasty and well marinaded! If you don't want pho, this dish is the next best dish to get for sure.  |Bun Bo Hue| $9.50 They only have this on the weekend, since I guess tourists are not familiar with this dish? It only come in large or x-large only so be prepare to have an appetite! I was a bit worried if I could finish that but luckily I shared so that helped a lot. The broth was very flavorful but not spicy like it should be. It reminds me from the one I had in VN a lot actually."}
{"text":"Have been going there for many years, even back in their smaller old location. Why do I keep going back? Tasty, hearty portions of all the basics of Vietnamese cuisine at a great price! I usually get the 26 (grilled chicken with vermicelli noodles and the usual herbs/peanuts, etc and lots of fish sauce, plus 2 spring rolls included for $8.75) or the 36 if I want more protein (mix of beef and chicken on same bed of vermicelli, but no spring rolls with this one, $9.75 I believe). Tax included so what you see on the menu is what you pay at the cash! Oh and speaking of cash, bring the bills as they don't take any credit or interac. Place is pretty clean by regular resto standards and straight up sparkling if you only consider Chinatown joints in the rating. Bathrooms are nice and modern, and have always been neat and tidy whenever I use them. Servers are the same from years back, and that, I feel, is one good indicator of a strong business. I've tried other Vietnamese in the city (Pho Tay Ho, Y Lan, etc) but feel that this one is the best bang for your buck if you are looking for cheap, tasty food with no (or little) attitude from the servers (can't say the same for Pho Tay Ho!)."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, authentic Vietnamese. We kept it simple with Phó, me with the Phó Ga and my husband with Phò Bo Vien (our usual).  We skipped appetizers, as they didn't have the pork rolls I adore, but the soup was filling enough.  The broth was extremely aromatic, piping hot, and flavorful.  It could've had more noodle - a bit skimpy in that department since I forgo the accoutrements (mung bean, lime, cilantro, etc), but otherwise excellent.  My husband, who has more experience in this area, says the broth was light and the meatballs weren't flavorful (rather, just big balls of meat).  But then again, he was still hung up on the Mongolian we had the night before!  The ambiance is clean and efficient with cafeteria style seating.  The staff is pleasant although a bit brusque."}
{"text":"The best pho I found in Montreal. Decently clean, good flavour. Only issue is that they make you sit beside stranger to fill up their resto as much as they can."}
{"text":"Louise and I got in pretty late to Montreal and needed somewhere to eat - not much was open within walking distance of where we were staying.  So we went to Pho Bang.  It was pretty underwhelming.  We both got Pho.  I got the Pho Bang, and Louise got a basic Pho (I don't remember exactly which).  Neither were very good.  In particular, the broth just isn't up to par.  It's not fatty enough (tasted more like it was made from a store-bought chicken stock than from a good beef/bone stock).  It also wasn't well seasoned.  In other words, fairly bland.    The meats in the Pho were ok, but really, they weren't great either (a bit too thickly cut).    Louise and I are a bit spoiled because we spend a lot of time in San Jose, California, where the Pho is generally very good, and we also have a friend who has made for us what I still consider to be my personal standard for Pho.  But despite all that, I wasn't asking for Pho Bang to be amazing - just a yummy late meal after flying all day.  Unfortunately, I was not particularly impressed."}
{"text":"O.m.g are you serious? Pho broth is so bland! I would think it's decent since there's french influence around here. This pho is worse than the instant pho I get at the Asian supermarket!  Take my word for it - if you're a pho-snob like me and you hail from SoCal esp the OC, this is not the flavor you're looking for!"}
{"text":"sometimes pho restaurants can taste pretty similar and you often don't know the difference. Being Vietnamese myself, even I can't taste the difference sometimes. However! This place hits the spot for me anyways and I enjoy the quick service and the pho broth and pho itself. It's located in Chinatown and it's the only pho restaurant I visit when I'm there. Warning though, at rush lunch period, you will most likely share a table with strangers. If you are okay with that, by all means eat there! They offer many typical Vietnamese dishes like obviously pho, but also appetizers like spring rolls, some specialty soups like bun bo hue, bun, etc. Their menu is pretty vast and covers the general dishes that Viet places usually have. It's not like a super \"omg, so memorable place!\" but I personally really like this spot for my pho when I am in Saint Laurent street area. Decent pho, decent place, decent service."}
{"text":"Est-ce que quelqu'un peut me dire que viennent faire les mots \"bang\" et New-York dans le nom de ce resto vietnamien, situé à Montréal de surcroit ?! Pouvez-vous m'expliquer pourquoi on a flanqué des statues grecques dans ce décor assez kitch qui n'a rien d'Asiatique ? Vous me direz que c'est plutôt secondaire quand on sert des plats aussi succulents à des prix plus qu'abordables. Et vous aurez bien raison. Pho Bang New-York est LE \"fast food\" vietnamien le plus populaire à Montréal. Et pour cause, tout est toujours très très bon."}
{"text":"Good pho, but I didn't find it to be exceptional.  Service was fine and the dining space was clean enough.  I hope you enjoy eating at communal tables."}
{"text":"I want to be fair.  I can see why people give this place a 4-5 stars rating base on its food.  Their pho is actually pretty good.  No question about it.  The reason that I gave it a one star was entirely for our unpleasant experience over there.  This may probably doesn't happen to most people, so just want to state this ahead to keep it in mind.   After we were seated, I asked the waiter if they accepted credit card.  I thought it was opened in Chinatown and they printed their menu and signs in Chinese, and most Vietnamese people speak Chinese as well, so it was natural that I asked him in Chinese.  He paused for 5 seconds and stared at me awkwardly, and that he said he only speak English.  That's fine for me, but the way that he was starring at us for 5 seconds was really awkward and sort of rude manner.   In any case, moving on from this.  While we were eating, this same waiter came from behind and told me to move my chair forward so that it gave more spaces in between two rows of the tables.  I don't think my chair position was occupying that much space, but in any case I don't mind to move either way.  But he never said word like \"sorry\" or \"thank you\", but rather like giving me an order or something.    Had it just end there, I would overlook this and gave a rating of 3 to this place, but what came after was really unpleasant.  After the meal, I went to the counter and paid the bill.  The cashier gave me back the changes, and I put the tips at the bill plate on the counter (which seems to be what others were doing too as I observed).   After we walked out, that same waiter chased from behind and sort of yelling that we forgot to pay the tips.  What?  I told him that I had left the tip amount on the counter's plate already.  He looked mad like I was lying to him and asked,\"Are you sure?\" in a pretty rude manner.  He acted in a way that like I stole money from him or something. I explained to him again and he just turned around and walked away.  Bet that he was cussing on the way back.   Looking back, I think what might have happened was that people leaving tips at the counter's plate instead on the table like we do in California.  This might confuse in some ways that they could mistaken who had paid the tip or not.  In any case, regardless what happened, it is very rude and unprofessional to chase after the customer to ask about the tips, and question you like a suspect additionally.   I mean, come on, we are talking about few dollars of tips here.  This kind of attitude was totally uncalled for."}
{"text":"This pho place is just ordinary. They don't even put the right ingredients in the pho dac biet, which is the most standard pho bowl. They didn't put any tendons or beef balls and they're supposed to use round beef eye. Seems like they used some tough skirt steak, so the meat was dry and chewy. The broth was not bad but I can't say this place is authentic. They didn't even give us lime or peppers on the side!!! If Vietnam is too far, the yelpers need to travel to San Francisco or San Jose to try authentic Vietnamese food. Why would they only serve bun bo hue during the weekends? And no Bun Rieu on the menu??? I'm not coming back unless I'm desperately for Vietnamese food. If this is the best in town, I don't even want to know how bad the others are around the block."}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese but have eaten Vietnamese food most of my life since my ex is Vietnamese. The first thing is the soup isn't good. Lot of MSG and not enough meat to cook the soup. The worst thing is when they ask about the tips at the end. Low end restaurant! We will give according to the service. My wife thought we didn't give them so she give them. Not good!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese fast food fare. I always go there when my folks are in town, and just for creds, mom grew up in Ho Chi Minh city and approves.  Other Viet restos around are decent but this one's been pretty consistent all around. It's usually very busy and sharing tables is something that happens often so if you're the kind that wants a quiet intimate affair, I wouldn't suggest this place. It's more of an eat and go, and forget refills for your tea. Otherwise, take out is a very good alternative."}
{"text":"This place is popular! I always try to do a bit of research before visiting any city to find out what places are worth eating at. Since Yelp Canada had slim offerings, I found Pho Bang thanks to Vice's guide to Montreal. The place is fairly large and on a Wednesday night it was packed wall-to-wall with diners. We didn't have to wait too long for a table for two and the wait is definitely worth it.  I've had some great pho in the States, but Pho Bang definitely topped many of the places I've been to. I had the pho tai and the bf got the pho with flank, brisket and tripe. I was a little disappointed by my beef but the broth was delicious! The bf loved his. The broth was well-flavored and not greasy which is a big plus with me. We also had shrimp spring rolls which were huge! The shrimp was fresh and cooked well. Service was quick and efficient and it was a pretty inexpensive meal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Keep your Friends close, keep your Enemies closer... Close enough to take the rest of her Pho away from her. When it comes to good eats, even Family have no sympathy.  A benefit here is there's plenty of Meat to go around, literally. No, not plenty of Fish just Beef and Chicken and Noodle Soups. I actually left some Chicken behind on my 2nd night. Apologies.  Busy crowd, tight squeeze, quick turnover, dine-with-strangers. People working there are always on their feet, hard to track down. They themselves barely have space to squeeze in and clean tables. Took a long while to get Menus, until I got up to the cashier counter. It is painful especially when there's strangers food inches from you ! [-0.5 star]   Bang'd 3.5'd  It's such a happening place in a convenient location, it should be 24hr. I thought it was until we narrowing squeezed in before they closed. Broth does have depth, aroma, herbs but sweeter than usual, my take. I guess it's better than being over-sodiumed and drinking water all night. Hot Broth, Meaty Meat full-bowlness, average portion Noodles. Eat. Satisfy. Sleep and/or Nap. Repeat."}
{"text":"Pretty good food decent. Service was good and the people were very helpful. I would definitely go back as their selection is enormous. They also exchanged US dollars into Canadian for us."}
{"text":"Cash only, average food, poor service.   Why is it pho comes with shit for service? I had the pho bo vein with a ca phe sua da.  The food is good. I saw several people get up and leave without being served."}
{"text":"Did my friends and I go on a bad day or something?!? It was the weekend and it was quite busy since we filled up the last big table available with a group of 6. We're all from Philly and visited Montreal for the weekend and needed our pho fix after a night out in town.   We all agreed that the pho was not as flavorful as we expect, but maybe we're just spoiled from all the different pho options that we have in Philly! Some of us didn't even have the urge to finish their bowl of pho and they were ambitious enough to order a large! We also tried one of their pork chop rice dishes (com tum thit nuong) and spring rolls (chia gao) and it was mediocre.   The staff was friendly and it was a clean restaurant though. Sadly, this is one of the few times looking on Yelp has failed me :( I guess it was a bad day, but I don't know if I'll have the chance to re-visit and try again."}
{"text":"I cant even count the number of times i've eaten there. It has been years! There are so many other pho restaurants near the area but this one is my \"coup de coeur\". My pho craving is always satisfied. Their three colors drink is good and it is my \"dessert\" after a warm bowl of noodles. Everything on their menu are good as well. It is a popular place, always crowded during lunch time and usually there's always a line up during weekends. Simple yet so tasty!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and cheerful eats. Expect generous portions. This place is constantly full. Don't expect 5 star dining dinner service, this place has more of a café feel. Super casual. But great for lunch or quick evening meal. Crispy vegetarian imperial rolls too! Large soups on a winter freeze - what more could you ask for? A frequent flyer here."}
{"text":"Five years ago, this place was one of the best but having paid a visit back recently, I don't think I will ever be returning back. The portion sizes just keep getting smaller and smaller and the prices just keep going up and up. The service is not the best I've seen either.  The only thing I like about this place is that the meat they put in the pho is on the better side (nicer pieces that are not broken apart and looked like mea snaps)."}
{"text":"Malheureusement, une pâle copie d'une bonne soupe.  Très bien situé, donc aide à sa popularité. Tout est simplement OK...sans plus.   Ça peut dépanner...bien en bas de la liste."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here for pho. We got seated right away and were given a lot of time to decide on what we wanted. We both ordered a small bowl of pho and it came after not too long. The food was good, pretty much what you should expect. There was a lot of meat, but not really that much noodles but probably because it was a small. It took a while for us to get our bill and I had to go up and ask for it. I'm not sure if they even gave us the right one, but okay.   Stop by here if you're craving for pho!"}
{"text":"Pho Bang NY became my favorite vietnamese pho restaurant in the town! you will see a lot of asians in there. I'd rather go to a restaurant where people know the taste go."}
{"text":"Pho was good - presentation was nice and the meat was sufficient. I would recommend getting their shrimp rolls - the peanut sauce goes very well with it!"}
{"text":"my girlfriend found a small pebble (?!) in her vegetable pho, which was very shocking as she almost broke her tooth. when we drew the waiter's attention to the pebble, he was skeptical and did not offer any assistance. in the end, i ended up paying for my meal while my girlfriend's meal was free. we haven't been back since. foreign objects aside, the food is ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"I'm still wondering why my group and I (all New Yorkers) came to Montreal to eat Pho Bang New York.  Decor-wise, it's very clean and bright compared to the pho places in Manhattan's Chinatown.  But food-wise, the pho here is mediocre at best, especially having eaten better pho in NYC but it's still a good and cheap eat.  I had the small bowl ($8 CAD)."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit or miss for me. I say this because sometimes the service is excellent and sometimes is meh ...   On this particular visit the service was better than the last time I went. Greeted and seated within 2 mins of arriving at the restaurant. Majority of the time you will find yourself seated quite closely to your neighbour (a communal type of seating).   I ordered their #5 which is noodle soup with eye of round steak, well done flank and tripe ... which in my opinion is basically the same as their #1 which I usually order (I could not tell the difference). The noodle soup comes with a side of bean sprouts, herbs and lime. The pricing is average, $8 for a small, $9 for a large and $10 for extra large.   Note that tax is already included, you just need to tip. Also, they only take cash. If you forget, there is an ATM right beside the cash register at the back.   I'd come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"I love how this place is so friendly. We only come once a year for the F1 race and the guy already remembers us. We like to come here before heading to the track for a quick, yummy lunch. We've ordered most of the pho and rice platters between the 5 of us in a span of 2 days. The pho broth is rich and flavorful and it doesn't leave that heavy msg taste in your mouth. I like the raw beef, round steak and tripe. however, the tripe is a little chewier. It's not a bad thing if you don't mind it.  The chicken and beef on the rice platters are tender and juicy. The waiters are super friendly and attentive. Best price and meal close to the metro!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here because it was pretty crowded.  Good call.  Quite possibly some of the best pho I've had in recent memory."}
{"text":"Came back for the pho and it is many times better than the vermicelli! Service was also better this time. Both times I've been here there was a line! So that must be a testament to how good the pho is -- which it is! Very flavourful broth and decent portions too. Very fair price, with tax included! I will come here again for the pho :)"}
{"text":"For reasons that yet remain unclear to me, the Montreal Chinatown has a surprising number of Vietnamese places including a ridiculous number of pho restaurants all clustered together.   Pho Bang New York is one among the many. An old and established branch of a New York based restaurant, you can almost always expect a queue outside during lunch and dinner. The New York branch is Zagat rated, but not so sure about the Montreal version.  The whole point though is that they do in fact serve pho.  How is it? Well it's pho, there's certainly no denying that, and it's even pretty decent pho and for a pretty decent price.  The lime, mint, and bean sprouts were very nice. The lime was juicy, the mint leaves were crisp and the bean sprouts were clean and healthy looking. The bowl of pho noodles were cooked nicely and the broth was well flavoured.  Overall I was satisfied with the food.  The service was pretty decent too even though it was crowded.  Was it magical? Was it the best in Montreal? Was it anything to write home about? Not exactly.  It was a nice bowl of pho.  It's definitely a place I wouldn't mind going back to, but I wouldn't stand in a queue for it."}
{"text":"A solid bowl of pho and good Bun Ga."}
{"text":"I grew up in Montreal and had fond memeries of the Pho that i ate then, came to this resto in hopes of reviving the taste buds, but was quite disappointed.   First of all the soup tasted ok, but it just slightly hotter than warm, which is a big no-no for any noodles in soup; the noodles were not cooked well enough and the meat, though in big quantity, was nearly tasteless. And what put me off most was the bad service, we went on a friday afternoon around 3pm, which wasnt even a busy hour, but the waiters did a very poor job, forgot a few things that we asked for, and were just plain unhelpful and impolite. Would not come back again."}
{"text":"My friend Reb and I used to come here at least once a week, if not twice in the winter time!   The service is fast, we don't even have to look at the menu, and sure enough it's definitely tasty and good every single time. It's our comfort food, and it's our go-to spot when we want to chat and eat something that we know is spot on.   Even the server knows my whimsical thing of getting veggie imperial rolls (that's spring rolls on the west coast) instead of pork and no carrots only the white radish. Since Reb moved away, I haven't found any regulars to come with me every week, but like a night like tonight, after attending Under Pressure, it was all I wanted and off we went. Sure enough, my number 26 (Grilled Chicken with Vermicelli aka Bun with Imperial Rolls) was as awesome as the last time!"}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco now but this is the only must eat spot for me when I come home for the holidays. Their spicy weekend pho is soooooo good. They don't use MSG in their broth which is very important when making pho choices. Their spring rolls, rice plates, everything is mmm mmm nom nom."}
{"text":"On a cold day, the day after the big storm, we were in search of Pho.  We yelped Vietnamese and found this spot.  Inside it is very basic and filled with lots of tables.  When we first walked in we were a little concerned because we didn't see that many Vietnamese people, but figured others found it on yelp too.  The broth was really good, actually better than what you would find in New York.  To my dismay, they did not have tendon!  The server told me that they haven't served that in over a year (still on menu).  That was disappointing, but we stayed anyway.  We ordered the spring rolls (fresh, not fried) and they were just alright.  We make better ones ourself at home...it was way too much lettuce and not enough herbs.  I did not like that they put the meat in the shrimp spring roll either - that was a surprise, also, the peanut sauce was gross.  PROS: Excellent broth! Quick service, well priced.  CONS: Spring Rolls, No tendon, beef in pho seemed like it was cooked in advance."}
{"text":"It's a shame because I've been coming here for a super long time and this time it was really bad. I used to recommend people to come here but now I'll never tell anyone to come here anymore . The service was horrible and they usually have a weekend special \"Bun Bo Hue\" that is worth it but this time it just really wasn't . First off the waiter got the order wrong and blamed us for it . 2nd of all , when he finally got it right it clearly was the same soup that he brought us initially with some added flavours. I grew up on this food and I can tell the difference easy between a pho and a bun bo hue , it's not that hard and I'm sure even an unexperienced palate can tell the difference between a pho and a tom yum derivative. That being said , I wasn't gonna leave a bad review because I've been coming here for the past 10 years until the owner said word for word : \"here it's not great service , you don't come here for the service you come here for the food ....\". This mindset is extremely flawed because service is the way you handle your customers. If you don't handle your customers well at the front of the house , I'm really starting to wonder how much you really care about the food. This place always smells horrible and it's as if they never clean the tables with a clean rag. It's a shame because I feel like I just cut ties with a 10 year old family member but hey business is business and if I'm gonna pay for  a meal I hope at least they care a little bit about their customers."}
{"text":"The bún is what I always get and they do it perfectly. Phó is not that special though. They often have lines in the evening and it's cash only (atm inside). All in all if you're looking for a cheap, family-oriented place that's also tasty go here!"}
{"text":"I'm just a really big fan of the grilled beef dish which is the only thing I eat here.  So keep in mind my rating is only for this dish and nothing else :)   The beef is butterflied, marinated and with some lemongrass and grilled (to tasty perfection).  I pretty much eat only the beef and rice.  The rice is covered with fried onion oil and I usually douse it with fish sauce. Served with a bunch of pickled carrots and daikon and fresh sprigs of cilantro on top!"}
{"text":"In Montreal's Chinatown, there are plenty of eateries to choose from. I wasn't aware that Pho Bang New York had been recognized as one of the best places to eat pho in the city, because my decision to eat there wasn't mine to choose.    It was mid-December, around 5pm on a Wednesday evening. It was pitch black and freezing; I'd say it was - 15 C, not including the windchill. Walking up and down Boul. Saint-Laurent between Viger Avenue and Boul. Rene Levesque, I was eager to to find a place to fill my stomach and escape from the cold for a while. There's no shortage of restaurants but which one to choose? When I saw a couple check out Pho Bang's menu posted on the window and go inside, I promptly decided to do the same. I thought that if it was good enough for them, it was good enough for me. I'm very glad that I did.   It's a large and clean restaurant, and the service was quick and prompt. It was before the dinner rush so it wasn't too crowded. I could enjoy my meal at a comfortable pace without feeling the need to eat and leave right away.   I ordered the pork spring rolls ($2.50) and a large pho beef bowl with flank beef and tripe ($7.50). The spring rolls were okay, though a little greasy for my taste, but the pho was delicious. The broth wasn't piping hot which is good. It's annoying to have to wait and watch your meal cool down when all you want to do is eat it. The broth was light and flavourful, and the meat cooked well. I've only had tripe once years ago so I completely forgot how it tasted; I realized that I wasn't missing much so I ate everything else in the bowl.   Admittedly, the large bowl was too large for me to finish it entirely. My swollen belly was fighting for room when the tights underneath my jeans were constricting my body. Needless to say, I felt very full but it was well worth it. There isn't any question that I'll return to Pho Bang New York again."}
{"text":"I have become a regular at that place because it is so damn good. The pho soup = excellent. The plate of beef (#15) = orgasm for my taste buds. This is a no frills place where you eat and go. The quality of the service depends on which waiter is working that day, but in general, it is very quick. You definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Never had pho; didn't know what it was; still not sure how it's different from a good soup.  However, I'll play the pho game and can say that this was one very good meal! Got the beef pho and it was beautifully prepped and presented. Flavorful broth, fresh veg, and a good protein - what more can I say?   To top it off, it was a ridiculously inexpensive meal.  I'd do pho again."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant for the price and the food. The price is great but the portion is small. The food presentation is nicer than the taste which is okay. The service left me a bit frustrated because I asked for tea at the beginning, I didn't get anything when the meal arrived and I asked for water.... The guy next to me got his order in less than a minute and his water in seconds. I'm not sure why I bother to go there when pho cali has better service. Overall, it is a decent place to go because the menu has pictures of the food.   I'm giving this place a three stars. By the way, they take only cash and they have an ATM machine next to the cash register."}
{"text":"Will never go back back. Mediocre Pho. Lousy service. They act like they serve the best Pho, but I would say there are other Pho with similar quality but cheaper."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place. They were fast, cheap and best of all, the Pho was phenomenal. The broth was delicious and the veggies tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Pho Bang New York is the more-or-less the best pho place in the area (and there are a lot of them in Chinatown!). The noodles (pho) have a good texture - soft and chewy. The soup could be more flavourful though, but that's just because I am used to the unreasonably high standard of pho they have in Toronto.   The service is not very good, but that's mostly because they're too busy most of the time. It might take a while to get the waiters' attention. You should also expect a wait if you're visiting at lunchtime or dinnertime.   Their sign has a weird font so it's harder to spot. The words \"Pho Bang New York\" is located on a separate sign on top of the normal rectangular plastic sign. If you're having trouble finding it, it's the shop literally right next to the dental clinic. It's also the second shop to the right as you walk north from the south gate."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the Pho Bang for quite some time.. Vietnamese for me is inexpensive comfort food. It's a great name also Pho Bang so I had to check out the noise to see what's it all about!  Pho Bang is as the name suggests is a busy restaurant. Maybe that's where the New York portion of the name comes in. Entering the place I was lucky to get a table right at the front. The place was packed. Like Grand Central train station at 5pm packed. Tables close together and servers weaving around the place serving food in a very efficient and calculated fashion! If crowded spaces are busy restaurants are not your deal then this is not your restaurant. As in other hellacious busy Vietnamese restaurants it's about efficient service and you don't come here for a server asking \"hello how are you doing honey\"? It's order your food, eat, pay, leave and come again. Don't screw with the system here or come in with inflated expectations.   Perusing the menu they had wonderful pictogram images of their dishes. Most items under $10. I had selected a bun noodle (vermicelli) dish that was grilled chicken and beef. With this I shared a plate of pork based spring rolls with my brother who I ate with. Serving size was a bit smaller for the vermicelli (as mentioned by my bro) but overall quality and flavour was excellent and fresh for the noodle bowl. The spring rolls were crispy and filling inside was a mix of ground pork and veg. Overall a solid meal. Meal with tax and tip for the two of us was just shy of $29 which is awesome and one of the reasons I come for Vietnamese. This is a busy place the food is on the upper end of good and one of the copious Viet places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is best know pho place in Chinatown. It's always packed with people. If you are going with several people, the wait could be long. I usually get number one on the menu, which is very good. I've also tried their rice dishes with meat. I like how the rice is very sticky. Be sure to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats and a nice environment, very clean unlike other pho places in chinatown"}
{"text":"Came in to order take out pho, automatic $10, didn't ask what size we wanted and gave us the extra large, held up till home, plenty of meat, broth was very light.  Pretty quiet around Thursday afternoon.  Decor is bright and clean. Cafeteria style seating with class."}
{"text":"This restaurant displayed great signs of Vietnamese cuisine. I ordered a number 1 extra large, and I was not dissatisfied. The food was filling and the amounts of beef were crazy. My friends who ordered rice dishes, complained however, but aside from that it the noodles were good. For a crowded place I also believe it's best to get more waiters. They only had one working waiter, good luck to them."}
{"text":"Standard pho restaurant - clean, fast, efficient. Solid menu and a small selection of drinks.  However, I was not impressed when I bit into a pork-filled spring roll despite having ordered the vegetarian set. Blech!  3.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get Pho in Chinatown. It's cheap, tea is free and the service is fast, albeit kurt and sometimes unfriendly."}
{"text":"TLDR: Tasty pho in Chinatown  My friend and I arrived at Pho Bang New York and within a few minutes we were seated. The tables are communal, so don't be surprised if you are seated with strangers. The service is quick and efficient.   I ordered the beef ball pho, and it arrived almost immediately. The light delicate but flavorful broth warms you up and it comes with a generous portion of noodles. The beef balls were delicious and very satisfying. If you like it spicy, don't forget to ask for some red chilli peppers on the side!  My friend who in one night tried several of the pho places in Montreal's Chinatown in one night vouched that this is the best pho in Chinatown. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend!"}
{"text":"Was brought in here by a friend yesterday around 3pm. Never really had Pho before or gave it any thought, friend ordered me a shrimp, with tomkin soup I think. It was amazing. Really really good. The bowl was massive and I destroyed the thing.  I'd return, but now wanna check out other Pho places, particularly ones that may have liquor licenses so I can spend some time there. But this place was excellent."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat one night and were just going to randomly choose a place, and then we walked by here and saw that it was jam-packed, line waiting to be seated and so we all looked at one another and walked in thinking: \"Wow, the Pho must be amazing!!\"  and... it was ok, definitely not the worst Pho I've had but it wasn't the best either. I guess I just don' t get it because the Pho back home is so much more rich and flavorful, this just tasted like slightly flavored water to me. The service was ok, and the seating is tight so be prepared to sit next to someone who you don't know.  I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't be a in a hurry to return here."}
{"text":"Pho was good, but service was poor. Sweet rainbow dream drink too.  Looked forward all day to a pho dac biet with extra tendon (I live in a city where pho isn't pho). When I ordered, the waiter sunk my battleship with news that they had no more tendon. When my order arrived, it was accompanied by unexpected spring rolls. I told the waiter that I hadn't ordered them, and he told me to enjoy them on the house. I thought this was a nice gesture for the tendon drought. Every request for service was  met with rude looks or  silence.  Come pay time, they charged me for the spring rolls."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I've been to in Montreal.  Service here is not that great. The waiters are pretty rude. The place is pretty unsanitary. The utensils are really dirty. You can see that there's dried vegetables stuck to some chopsticks and sauce or something stuck to the spoon. The tables are dirty and there's left over bits from the previous customer.   But besides that those are not the only things to worry about. I got my bowl of pho last out of all the people at my table and in my bowl of pho there was a small dead bug floating around........  I told the waiter about it, he didn't argue about it or anything and just agreed to give me a new bowl. He dumped a bowl of vegetables into my pho to show me that they aren't just going to pick the bug back out and return the pho back to me. Which I think it was a really nice gesture.   But I just can't give it anything above a 1 star due to hygiene issues. Cups were chipped, chopsticks and spoons are nasty and tables were sticky.   As for the pho, it was meh.  It seemed really watered down and didn't have much flavour."}
{"text":"Some days you just need the comfort of some amazing Pho and a spring roll to make everything alright. Pho Vang New York is my go to for Pho in the city only second to Pho Lien in my humble opinion. The broth is perfect and the service is great and fast. When you have that kind of week and need a warm hug come eat some Pho. The price is great too"}
{"text":"One of the least memorable bowls of pho I've had, which is a shame because this was the only Vietnamese place I got to try while in Montreal. I had high hopes, but don't remember much at all. I had a vegetarian option, maybe their meat pho is better."}
{"text":"First time I had weekends special spicy pho. The soup is cover with too much oil and  I think it is under the Tomyum seasoning, given the price is a little higher than the regular ones. I also tried regular pho once. I think it is too much of the Chinese medicine taste to me. I like the one across the street call Bac better.  They accept plastic. That is better than Bac."}
{"text":"For the pho that I had in Montreal, this was my favorite. A good mix of people, tasty pho, good broth and tasty meat on the side.  The smoothies here were pretty decent also.  This is a BUSY place though so you might end up having to sit at a table with a couple groups of other people. No biggie though!  The steamed rolls were very tasty as well...I have zero complaints from the food here. Not the best in the world, or the country even, but still very good!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing pho! I got the chicken and vegetables pho and put in some siracha (cant have any asian food without it) and it was to die for! I got the small bowl for $7 which is more than enough! So filling yet light at the same time! When you order the pho you get a bean sprout and lime salad for free as well as tea.    Good stuff and a must try!"}
{"text":"About two weeks ago I went to Montreal with my boyfriend for a mini vacation. Prior to our plans to go to New City Gas I was feeling hungry and decided that I wanted to eat pho. Our hotel that we were staying at was located extremely close to Chinatown so we Yelped \"Pho\" and found Pho Bang New York!   I ordered: Pho Dac Biet, Spring Rolls and Che Ba Mau.  One thing that might not be significant to others is that this place is run by Northern Vietnamese people, which is an amazing change from the many Chinese run pho restaurants located in Toronto.   What I really liked about the pho was that the broth wasn't muddled up with fat and was a clear broth that still had a great taste. Unlike the many places I have been in Toronto, Pho Bang New York was generous on the beef and a good portion of rice noodles. I ordered a small and it was just too much to eat for me. My boyfriend had to help me!   The spring rolls on the other hand wasn't as good as the pho. I felt that it wasn't that special and was a standard vietnamese spring roll. The taste and flavours were really boring. I wouldn't recommend this choice.  Finally the dessert drink was great too! But to be honest the best part of my meal was the pho. :)   Overall I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others that are in Montreal for the first time.   -CL"}
{"text":"More like NHO BANG!??!?!  If you are used to the delicious goodness that is NY's Chinatown's Pho Bang, then do not jump up and down when you see a version in Montreal. How one can ruin good old fashion Cum Ga Nuong beats me, but this meal was awful. Everything is over-fried and over-cooked and just not good. Heartbreaking, really."}
{"text":"EDIT 2: So I come here occasionally (whenever my group wants pho), and I started to notice that the portions of noodles and meat lack heavily compared to other, albeit less popular pho restaurants (like the one across the street). The last few times I've gone, I literally could've pulled out all the noodles they gave me on one chopstick dip.   While the quality of the broth and meat is still good for the price, the amount of food they give takes away from the original 5-star appeal that this place had for me.   I honestly think there are better places to go if you want more food for similar quality and price, not to mention their prices are no longer cheaper than the surrounding pho restaurants. Kind of disappointed that my once favourite pho restaurant no longer holds the same value that it used to!  EDIT:  After coming here on a busier day, I can safely lower my rating down a notch. While the food is fantastic for the price, the service and atmosphere is at best average.   When the restaurant is busy (most days), the tables get really cramped and it's hard to eat your food without knocking elbows with the person next to you, and the service is quite slow / not super attentive.  ORIGINAL:  5 stars because this is to me the best pho place for its price in the city  10$ for an extra large (tax included) which can probably feed two but i down that s*** so fast  very good quality beef, great broth that honestly tastes so different to other pho places  my friend used to convince me that this place was so much better whenever we went to different pho places, I never believed it but damn once I came here it's clear who reigns over the pho kingdom  the decor and atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and the service is fine, no complaints  note: haven't tried the non-pho dishes but why would you, it's pho bang new york, don't come here for non-pho items if you want the best they have to offer also, you must use the sauces (hoisin, sriracha, lime) well in order to achieve the best tasting broth  my pho-avorite place hehehe"}
{"text":"Great spring rolls that had huge chunks of pork in addition to the shrimp in them.  Wonderful authentic peanut sauce served on the side.  Had the pho dac biet.  No jalapenos were provided on the side but the broth was plenty satisfying although nothing to write home about.  Noticed tons of individuals coming in and out on a cold december evening.    Clean bathrooms and hit-or-miss wait staff.  Had to ask three times to get water."}
{"text":"Pho is alright but not good enough to make me come back given the lack of service. I was seated and given tea but was never given the menu for ten minutes or so - I thought maybe I'm suppose to order at the front? Nope. The guy at the cashier just looked at me and gave me a pissed off look. This place also doesn't provide a sauce plate."}
{"text":"Have had the pho and grilled vermicelli plates. The broth for the pho leaves one very thirsty which makes me believe that lots of msg is dumped in there. They give alot of meat and they're all too thick. The ratios of meat with noodle is just off. All in all, not my favorite bowl of PHO. The grilled chicken plate, the chicken again is too much. The pieces are just super thick and I felt the need to make sure they were well cooked. Because they were so thick, they were also not very tasty. I wouldn't go back. There's definitely much better viet food elsewhere."}
{"text":"A good place to have Pho, BUT not the best. Trust me ! I'm a Vietnamese ,so, my standards for Pho are extremely high.   Let's begin with experience. The restaurant is clean. I mean not just for a \" Asian restaurant Level clean\", the kitchen is shiny and also the toilet. BUT my table is sticky like a scotch tapes. Decent customer service. But also a Plus for the aroma of Pho when you just get in the restaurant.  The food itself is 7/10. It is lack of favour. Not \"beefy\" enough. Although it will be good for Chicken Pho. I also order a Spring roll (not that special). But it was really cheap. $8 for a small and $10 for a extra large. I order a small bowl and it filled me up.  It was a pleasant experience, decent food cheap price. It definitely a return."}
{"text":"Pho Bang turned out to be Pho Dud while it was not the worst Pho I have had, it certainly was a big let down when compared to back home. The broth lacked real richness, depth of flavor and no indication that beef bones and been introduced into the cooking process. The Ch giò were okay as was the Gi cun, atleast they were not as disappointing as the Pho. This restaurant was jammed packed that evening with a 10 to 15 minute wait for a table, that alone seem to augur an experience worth the wait, sadly it didn't and my dining partners, who know a thing or two about Pho, all agreed."}
{"text":"I know... why I am I have Pho when I am in Montreal?   And I even there twice during my short stay?!!   Yes, Pho Bang New York is definitely worth a repeat visit.  I suggest just order the Pho... the broth is one of the best I have... or the best I remembered... Great aroma, well seasoned with herbs, rich with beef flavour.....   This restaurant is definitely packed! We ended up sharing a table with others and even have to step over people to get out!  The washroom is so clean... dare I say smell good?! One of the cleanest washrooms in a Vietnamese Pho joint!  Good washroom, excellent food... that really deserves a repeat visit!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pho I've had this year. Friend recommended it saying it was the best pho in the north east. It wasn't even the best meal I ate for lunch that day. I had some dragon beard's candy and maybe a bug flew into my mouth, both were significantly better.  The noodles were stiff, the meat was tough, the broth was unflavorful. Also, I ordered some fried rolls and they were made with imitation crab rather than pork. This wouldn't have been a problem, but it was super salty too. The bug was still better than this."}
{"text":"The pho broth was a little too sweet for me. Probably just me because my mom thought it was alright. Overall the pho was fine.   My dad for the cam tam suon tom. The meat and the shrimp were both seasoned very well.   Overal, the food was very tasty. Might want to watch the prices though."}
{"text":"This was one the best vietnamese restaurant I ever run into. It was a nice to find it during our Montreal trip. Real good value on the price, you can order a variety of beef pho and grill pork and egg rolls and you're still within the budget. Taste better than most places you can find. The service was quick and fast and the waiter sure know his stuffs well. I certainly give it a 5 stars."}
{"text":"First of all, this is a cash only restaurant where even debt card is not allowed. If you don't have cash with you, sorry! But you will need to pay a surge to use the ATM machine in the store. That will add an extra two or three dollar to your 8-10 dollar pho meal. ( not worth it).   Secondly, the host behind the counter does not has a hospitality attitude.   I don't know the exact reason why they are following that cash only payment practice, but that did made my experience with the restaurant unenjoyable.  There's other places similar in the city for more reasonable payment options. Will go for the alternatives for sure."}
{"text":"never being desapointed by pho because no other ethinicie than real vietnamese people will try to open a pho place enough said great soups and taste authentic and fresh"}
{"text":"The place was very busy.  They squeeze you in like sardines in a can.  Every empty chair is basically available for anyone who walks through the door.  Think communal seating.  I tried the #1 pho Dac Biet pho bang. The broth was bland.  The meat selection was okay.  The pho wasn't chewy like fresh pho noodles.  Overall, it wasn't very satisfying.  I supposed I've been spoiled with pho from northern VA and LA.  If this is the best Montreal has to offer, pho lovers here need to check out restaurants in NOVA and LA."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nicely decorated and lit restaurant but it's a little bit small. The thing that I don't like about this place is that once it starts getting busy, they'll start seating you next to people on the same table. I find that this makes me feel cramped and it just feels awkward to sit next to stranger.  FOOD: This is probably one of my favorite spots for pho, and my parents would agree. We used to come here every week on the weekends just to get our fix! Their fish sauce and noodle plates are delicious as well. The grilled beef that it comes with is super flavorful.  PRICE: Prices are decent, you're pretty much gonna find the same prices for every pho restaurant in the area.  SERVICE: Service used to be a lot better than it is now unfortunately. It's still okay but it could be better."}
{"text":"Went back to this place a 2nd time and must say I wasn't impressed at all, the vietnamese style seating and service (as in how they actually do it in Vietnam) may be charming for some, especially if you're used to it, but when you're used to north american standards in restaurants, it's kind of annoying to be crammed up against strangers, listening to them talk or vice versa.  The service is also sketchy at best, one couple left complaining they hadn't been served in an hour.  We had to walk to the cash to ask for menus.  The pho itself is ok, the broth isn't bad, but it's nothing spectacular either.  My wife ordered the shrimp and noodles dish and the shrimp were raw...  nice.  Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is they are ridiculously generous on the meat in the pho."}
{"text":"The soup was lukewarm and bland. The summer rolls tasted like they were sitting already made for a while. The service is rushed and curt. No redeeming qualities whatsoever."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite pho place in Montreal.  Soup and noodles are perfect, as are the fixings.  When this place first opened in its new location it was also kind of funny that they made it somewhat Grecian (in addition to having these marble lions guarding the basement bathrooms...?).    Note: they do not give a lot of bean sprouts compared to other places."}
{"text":"We were in here 2 weeks ago during our trip to Montreal. Food is awesome, the pho is pretty close to 5/5 and super yummy, only problem is that it's not very clean and our one waiter was super rude. He might have been having a bad day or something so at least the food makes up for it. Ignore the service and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"visiting from nyc and looking for a quick place for lunch, we tried pho cali instead of pho bang new york because they have a restaurant in nyc anyway. we didn't regret eating here, service was good, and food was solid. nothing too special to rave about. i think theyre used to seeing tourists here though because they have a system with exchanging US dollars set so they arent babbling some random stuff on the spot."}
{"text":"liked this place ever since it opened in Flushing, NY more than a decade ago. remember having come here last time i was in montreal a long while back (not the same location probably but still in chinatown), and still loved it.  then revisited this place this time; it didn't disappoint.  the place still offers good eats for cheap, food came quick and service is just about what one could expect for everyday asian restaurants: quick and to the point.   there was a scare upon our entrance though: one of the waiters slipped and almost fell onto the wet floor. he got up quickly and mobbed the place thoroughly. later we found out it was due to their plates of fresh bean sprouts and basil leaves. the other waiter brought out dishes of them in one go, and they were all dripping water leaving trails on the floor--it's an invisible safety hazard!! i was worried for my life as we sat right by the passageway, and every time the waiters walked by with bowls of scalping hot soup and noodles i was super paranoid.  other than that, the food was on par and i loved it. had the fresh rolls with shrimps, shredded lettuce, and vermicelli wrapped firmly (it didn't fall apart to the last bite. that's skill!) in a translucent rice wrapper, accompanied by a generous portion of peanut sauce for dipping. you can tell the wrapper was relatively freshly made as it was soft even though it's no longer warm. but it didn't yet harden and become starchy like they will over time, either. so that's points for them.  my vermicelli with grilled pork, deep-fried spring roll, and a thing of pork sausage was flavorful and refreshing at the same time. slight complaint about the vermicelli being too \"wet\" and too warm; it seemed to come fresh out of the pot and didn't have time to drain and cool down. but the texture wasn't mushy, nor do they stick together and couldn't separate. another small complaint is the oil that's added to the bottom of the bed of fresh, shredded veggies. that was probably to prevent sticking or drying, but i didn't find the addition of raw oil necessary at all (nor do i find that a custom in most other pho places i've eaten in). but since i don't normally mix my veggies into the vermicelli anyway, i had no problem leaving them alone at the bottom of the bowl. but if i had liked to scoop them all up from the bottom, i might have an issue w/the oil.  my bf's large pho really came large. i can hardly ever finish my food before he does but this day i did it. by the time i was done he didn't seem like he had touched his bowl of pho at all!  taste-wise, the meat was cooked well and the noodle, while less al dente than i had expected, was still good and not choppy or mushy. i've had broth elsewhere that was slightly stronger and more flavorful, but this one ain't bad either; just different.  this place gets busy during meal time so better arrive early or in small groups, although i've seen families of 6+ being seated in a timely fashion. in all, this is a great place for a quick, cheap eat, and one that fills your stomach."}
{"text":"Great pho right in the Quarter Chinois. There were quite a few places the have Pho but read the other reviews on Yelp and decided to try. The service was fast and efficient. The pho was very good. We also had an order or the shrimp spring rolls.  All in all enjoyed our experience here"}
{"text":"Gave me the shits. And the soup was not all that hot. maybe it was too early in the morning? i dont care. not going back. Done n done"}
{"text":"Pork chops were not well seasoned, noodles are too mooshy, food was too sweet, definitely overrated."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant vietnamiens servant plusieurs repas typique comme les soupe pho, de la viande et des plats à base de poisson.  J'ai bien aimé, j'y suis aller plusieurs fois pour prendre une soupe pho avec boeuf et nouille. Le prix est vraiment bon, plusieurs taille avec même pas 1$mdr différence entre chaque taille. Le bouillon était vraiment bon, en fait tout était bon.  J'ai essayé la soupe épicé du dimanche (il me semble que c'est le dimanche). Elle vient avec des jarets de boeuf nerveux, j'ai pas aimé la viande j'ai tout laissé. J'avais demander si c'était des flanc comme les autres parce que j'aime pas les boeuf avec os, On m'a dit oui mais ce n'était pas le cas. Le bouillon était épicé, assez pour les gens normaux je dirais mais comme je mange ultra épicé, j'ai ajouter énormément d'épice. Le reste était tout de même bon.  J'ai pris un rouleau impérial en entre, très petit mais bon."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 15 years, the Pho with raw steak,the spring rolls, and number 26 ( noodles and grilled chicken), are among the best I have found in Montreal, the service is fast and efficient, the place is always full and there is a huge turnover so you can expect fresh everything. Added bonus it is a cheap meal, and they have always been consistently good."}
