{"text":"This place use to be Bar10der, before that use to be a souvlaki place. Decided to give this place a try as they are open late on weekends.

This place has an open patio outside, and a nice looking simple interior. I can see that their table is of good quality. Now on to the food I have tried today...

Chicken skewer (one order gives 3 wings)
- Nicely cooked wings with a dry rubbed spice that wasn't too spicy.
Tofu skewer (one order gives 3 pieces)
-Its simple cooked tofu with same spice as the wings.

Lavar & Dried Shrimp Egg-Drop Soup
- Came in a really big size bowl that can feed 4-5 ppl
- Taste simple, for the price of $8 for just seaweed and egg drops is quite expensive.

Spinach Vermicelli
- This dish is served cold.
- Like eating Jap Chae but this has a sour taste to it.

Siu Long Bao (Soup filled dumpling)
- Ordered two basket where one had 7 pieces and the other 8 pieces.
- This is not made, instead, its bought from outsource.
- Did not taste fresh and the dough was quite puffy look.

Pan Fried Dumpling
- This came in 6 good size pieces.
- This I am not certain if made but was quite tasty and pan fried nicely.

Price is pretty okay depending on what you get, and I would come back because its open late night and they have quite an extensive menu."}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant frequently and the food tastes awesome. Last time i went there i found a long hair in my \"Spicy Beef\" plate. I called the waiter and showed her the hair, she didn't even say sorry and was telling me that she can't see. Finally she could see and cancelled the dish. I feel gross after that so i don't plan to go there anytime sooner"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was acceptable even tho the servers could hardly speak/understand English.  Really relaxing to eat outdoor in a warm night. 
The restaurant does NOT accept credit cards........debt card or cash only."}
{"text":"When it first opened up, I wasn't very excited cause I heard it was just a dim sum place. But last week my dad found a $5 off $50 coupon so we decided to go check it out. And I quite liked it!

We went for dinner and I'm from North Eastern China so the food suited my taste quite well (they're north west). The lamb kabobs were excellent! The flavors were great.

The tie ban niu liu we got (sizzling beef plate?) wasn't the best. A bit sweet for our taste. And the beef wasn't cut very well so there were a lot of really big pieces throughout the dish which was hard to eat especially since it was so saucy.

My only complaint other than that dish is the slowness of the food. Our fried rice came before our apps...and maybe 15 minutes before our main dishes. That's just weird...the rice was luke warm by the time we got our lamb and beef... and apps came out in the middle after we got the soup. Hmm... I found that a bit strange.

Overall, I enjoyed the place very much. The prices were quite affordable, I expected it to be a bit more expensive since the decor is nice but I was pleasantly surprised. I'll be making a trip back there eventually."}
{"text":"There has been many restaurants at this location over the years and I think they might have a hit now. The restaurant looks nice and very well decorated. It was comfortable and staff wore uniforms.

This is a North Chinese restaurant which means the food is spicy and BBQ'd. This reminds me of Yang's restaurant at Finch and Midland but this place was more professional.

The food was really good as well and prices were lower than what you would expect based on the experience. I would definitely go back especially late at night and I don't want dirty greasy Chinese restaurant food.

They gave us complimentary sugar bean drink which was perfect, not too sweet but still yummy. (Inexpensive freebies at restaurants help a lot)

{"text":"Brand new restaurant, opened by the same people that also own \"Xin Jiang\" restaurant at Steeles and Warden.  

Comfortable and clean-style decor, being brand new, everything is neat and clean and easy on the eyes.    

Extensive menu, ambitiously encompassing well-known dishes from Uyghur / Xin Jiang, Xi'an, Szechuan, and generic Northern Chinese food.  The menu is relatively well organized into categories such as dim sum, rice/noodle dishes, hot pot, and protein choices.  We also found our waitress to be quite helpful when it comes to explaining and recommending dishes.  

Food is tasty, liberal use of spices and layering of flavours.  Presentation isn't a strong point here as most of the dishes we'd ordered looked (and tasted) on the greasy side but we didn't care since it's only once in a while.....

I'd recommend these based on what we'd sampled:
BBQ lamb kabob -- as good as the ones in \"Xin Jiang\" resto
Xinjiang style greenbean noodle salad (A22) -- not really a \"salad\" but a cold noodle dish with a complex savory-spicy-numbing-tart-faintly sweet sauce.  A must-try
Szechuan style spicy bone-in chicken (A18) -- a generous-sized app dish, tender chicken, spicy delicious sauce
Slice beef sesame pancake (J9) -- the \"pancake\" has a fluffy sesame-encrusted pastry-like outer layer, very yummy
Sesame biscuit with Chinese doughnut (J18) -- I like doughnut, I like it even better when it's sandwiched between airy and yummy tasting pastry, and a smear of Hoisin sauce.  

Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Lured here by the promise of lamb and other spicy dishes I must say that I was pretty disappointed by the food at this restaurant. 

I came here on a Saturday night with some friends and walked into a buzzing restaurant. We were seated quickly and decided to order a few dishes and eat family style (which is the best way to go at most Chinese restaurants). We ate the following: 

- Pork belly with steamed buns, this dish was just ok. The pork was cut into good sized slices but was rather dry. The steamed buns helped curtail the fattiness of the pork but unfortunately the number of pork slices outnumbered the amount of buns, EPIC FAIL! 

- Hand pulled noodles were pretty good, they were thick and cut into amazingly long strands making for a comical attempt to get them in my bowl with chopsticks, luckily my Asian friends gave me a hand. The noodles were tasty but slightly undercooked making them tough to chew. 

- Cold noodles in a spicy sauce (may have been chilli oil?) were sub-par, they did have a bit of a kick from the chillies but were too oily and had very little flavour beyond the spiciness. This dish was a $1.99 special so I can't complain too much that it wasn't great.

- Spicy lamb in hot pot was hands down the best dish of the night. The lamb had a good meat to fat ratio and was melt in your mouth tender. It had a big kick from all the red chillies and was also cooked with whole garlic cloves which were tender and a little sweet adding some great flavour to the dish. This dish was a winner. 

- Lastly we had a chicken, radish and pork stomach soup. There are few things in this world that I cannot stomach the taste of and this dish is one of them. I found this dish to be absolutely gross, none of the flavours really worked for me. The soup had a sour taste, the radish being boiled in the soup gave it an odd flavour, the pork stomach was overwhelming and the chicken kind of got lost in it all. I would definitely recommend passing on this dish. 

Aside from the mediocre food the restaurant itself is quite large, bright, and open. The tables are more conducive to big groups and family style dining. The service was good, our food came out quickly and the servers were pretty attentive (it probably had to do with the fact that the owner or manager was watching over them that night). A bonus is that they have cheap beer; a pitcher of beer will set you back about $9 a price that is hard to beat. Parking here is a bit of a nightmare; the lot is very tight and was pretty full (if it's full there is a plaza across the street that you can park in). Overall I do not think I will be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"it's pretty great if you pick the right dishes. some are completely not worth it and are prepared poorly while others are done very well. i thought the beef noodles, the spicy mushrooms & the lamb skewers + lamb on toothpicks were all pretty decent :) 

sometimes we needed to repeat to the waitresses several times to get something we wanted (like water or rice) and sometimes they have attitude which kinda sucks, but there are also a few servers who are pretty pro and attentive...so depends who you ask I guess!"}
{"text":"The Only Cuisine Corp location used to be a Bar10der where a lot of UFC party has been held and of course other sport viewing event include College Basketball.. And now it is a Northern Chinese Restaurant.

The interior has been completely renovated. No more TVs and monitors showing baseball/hockey games. All the patrons have one thing in mind now.. just like me is to eat!

Everything here is just mega sized, for sure bring a friend or two with big appetite as the menu here is extensive!!

I ended up trying:

Beef Noodle Soup (a little blend in taste)
BBQ Lamb Kabob (well flavoured with cumin)
Sliced Beef Bun (a little on the dry side)
Lotus Paste Pancake (for dessert)

Price wise is really reasonable. Though nothing outstanding and exceptional but everything done A-OK.

The patio in front is perfect for smokers to hang out in between dishes, not really set up as space for eating and drinking.

Give The Only Cuisine Corp a try if you are in the area.."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner with some new friends.  Google Maps failed me as well since it was pointing to the plaza west of this.  Looking for parking here was horrendous, took me about 10-15 minutes to give up looking and park at the plaza next door.  The food we ordered were mostly too spicy for my tastes.

Service was actually good.  If this was run by the same people an Xin Jiang, it would be hard to believe as the service in Xin Jiang would be significantly sub-par compared to the service we got here.

The food for four people including beers were $20 per person, but we got 4 dishes and a pitcher of beer.

They had hand pulled noodles, which were a bit of a challenge to get to our bowls.  The strands were quite long and heavy.

My favorite dish was the pork belly buns.  Though they were a bit on the dry side and the number of buns do not equal the number of sliced bellies.  They should give more parsley on the side too since it helps with the flavor.  It was my favorite because it helped buffer the spiciness of the rest of the dishes.

They had a $1.99 special dish which looked like some noodles with spicy sauce.  Unfortunately, it was just too spicy for me, I couldn't even eat more than one try.

They had spicy lamb in hot pot.  Now considering I am not really a fan of lamb or spicy food, I kept on eating this.  Though I needed to buffer the food with the buns and the noodles.  Like Xin Jiang, I did like the lamb skewers they have, so maybe I can tolerate lamb as long as it is in the Northern Chinese style aside from the New Zealand type lamb.

Finally we had chicken with pork stomach soup.  This was sour and spicy.  The spices cover up the general yucky after taste of the pork stomach and the chicken buffered some of the spiciness.  I only had one bowl, but it was still good.  I just gulped the soup and flushed it down with the noodles to get rid of the spiciness.

Overall I am happy with the food and service and I would likely come here again and order food that I can tolerate."}
