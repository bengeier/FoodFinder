{"text":"This place has amazing wings, awesome ranch, fresh salads and great decor. We go weekly for wings and a salad. The mango habe√±ero wing sauce is the tits!"}
{"text":"Third visit with the new owners. While the food is still good I noticed that the meat on the sandwiches isn't piled like it used to be and twice in a row now I've gotten home with food to find my order is wrong. While I realize a new venture can be overwhelming at times there's no organization and a lot of confusion. Hoping you get it together soon as this is a great place."}
{"text":"Heard tons of great things about this place.  Have to admit they are all true.  Haven't had one bad experience there, and am happy to support a family owned/run business.  Sure I could go to a chain and get a \"pizza\"  and it would taste the same every single time, anywhere in the country, but that isn't pizza...this is!  I love that this is made by a person, not a machine spitting out dough balls for the crust.  They take real pride in their craft & I wish more companies were like this!"}
{"text":"Love that they serve slices!  Friendly staff, clean environment and convenient.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"The most amazing food! Can't get enough of the wings! Calzones are fabulous! The people here treat you like family. Thank you Submarinos for making my taste buds smile!"}
{"text":"When I am craving Italian food but don't want to do the cooking,  I come here.   The staff is always friendly and welcoming.  Best of all,  the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Just order some pizza subs and a pizza and omg super. Yummy. 
I been a costumer for year my brothers and I love this place. Our favorite #22 and #10 #17. The lady owner is a wonderful person she has a wall with pic of the customers and he took my brother  last pic. And went my mother went because she wanted to see it the lady owner made a 8x10 pic so my mom could take home...   I love this place thank you for your lovely service . and yummy food."}
{"text":"Great pizza , friendly employees 
Nice size dining area , they have specials and fountain drinks . We always get the pizza and wings special"}
{"text":"We LOVE this pizza, it's delicious! BUT we can never get through the phone line to place an order. The voicemail box is always full. And we won't go in as walk-ins because since the voicemail box is full, we don't know if it is open. So we end going to another pizza place. If you are able to get through to order a pizza, it's really good! Five stars for the pizza, 1 star for contacting them to place an order."}
{"text":"I had never tried this place but live in the area. The cashier at Frys told me they had new owners and the pizza was 100 times better than previous years. Of course I had to try because we were already talking about food and I was hungry. I didn't expect to get the royal treatment when I went in. Cashier so friendly and was happy to tell me about the different pizza specials. Took the two pizza deal home for the kids but couldn't help but to open the box while driving, not just one but two slices before I even pulled in the driveway. It was so delicious and perfect in every way. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"So how is Submarinos?? One word.......FANTASTIC!!! The food is FANTASTIC! The service is FANTASTIC! The atmosphere is FANTASTIC! Since Submarinos has gone under new ownership we have been there 6 times and have not been disappointed and have found our new favorite restaurant in town! Have had the antipasto salad, sub, lasagna, cannoli, and various pizzas and all are FANTASTIC! Submarinos new menu launched today and I would highly recommend the White Pizza Pies....again FANTASTIC!! Also saw a new glass display case with pizzas in it which made it great for deciding what looked especially yummy!! Definitely worth checking out Submarinos! You will not be disappointed!:)"}
{"text":"Me and my hubby went there tonight when I got off of work. I ordered the calazone, and he ordered the philly sub. You guys my calazone was the size of my head!!!!! Not only was the size impressive, but the taste was absolutely spectacular! The philly that my husband ordered was stuffed full of meat and veggies. It tasted fantastic as well. Service was amazing. Employees were very helpful and nice! I was also impressed with the cleanliness. I will be going again and again! Thank you submarine's we will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ordered pizza and wings from this place. Third and last time I eat here. The service is not good the zuccini we ordered as last 2 times was burnt tasted horrible threw more than half away couldnt stand it. Pizza is supposed to be a large but it is more like a small not even 16 inches. The barbque wings drenched in sauce. Then they throw in extra charges with out an explaination. Would not recommend it to anyone or will we go back. 
Maybe even going to talk to Glandale tax auditor the taxes just dont add up. 
Very disappointed in customer service and food."}
{"text":"I'm full. I have half a cannoli left and  1/2 a slice of pizza. For a pretty decent price, $6.50 ( yes I'm cheap) they give you 2 slices and a drink. 

The owner and workers are friendly and fast.  The inside is so cute. It's good."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever eaten! I am in love with their turkey sandwich it is to die for, I'll never eat one from any other sub place! Today was my first time going to the actual store (I have tried a sandwich my parents brought home before) and the staff was nothing but friendly and very helpful  I plan on making a regular stop!"}
{"text":"We got there at 7:54 pm on a Friday night and they close at 8 pm.  One of the owners was outside and said \"go on in\"  even after we told him we planned on sitting down.  Actually we were going to leave when he said he was the owner and to \"go on in!\"  Wow!  Service at it's finest, care about the neighborhood!  They are awesome!  We were fans before...even when they were at 51st and Northern! Now fans for life!!!!  The food was yummy, the staff did not hurry just because we were there past closing, and I felt welcome!  Everyone try them, if you haven't before!  Excellent food, great neighborhood restaurant, great staff, great owners!!!  They made our 31st Anniversary even better!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza lately. I'm from back east and it is hard to find real pizza out here. This is pretty close. I like their sauce. Been almost everywhere out here in Glendale so...
Their sandwiches aren't anything special, but they're good."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family after golf. We were the first people to try their new Buffet. Excellent salad followed up by some great Pizza. Particularly enjoyed the meat lovers. The staff was incredibly friendly and provided first class service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was average at best. I would give a 2.5 star rating if I could. The zeppoli's were like a bread jerky...disgusting and cold and chewy like jerky. Do not waste your $$. After several orders, I want to like this place but there is always something that just falls horribly short."}
{"text":"New to the area. Looking for good neighborhood pizza joint....found it! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!  Everything we ordered was excellent.  Good quality food.  Fast, friendly service.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We just found this awesome new place! New owners. Very friendly. The food is excellent and fresh! Our favorite is the #1 assorted - hot. Their bread has true Italian taste! We now come here weekly. We highly recommend this place!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"i having ordered there 3 times in the last week, and tried several different items, i cant tell you how impressed i  am. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad and ordered the small, it was plenty, the subs are enough to share, and the eggplant is as good as my Grandma's. I am a winter visitor, and the delivery was FAST! and for 1$!!!! (so be sure to tip your driver!!!)"}
{"text":"Great sub sandwiches. Love the number 16 that they have on the hot menu for sub sandwiches. I bring my family here and they love it too even the cold sandwiches."}
{"text":"I used to go here at least every 2 weeks. They were amazing. Unfortunately, I was unable to go for a few months, but finally got in tonight, and was disappointed :( The size of the sandwiches has been reduced significantly, while the price remained the same. The amazing potato and macaroni salads, along with the cole slaw, is no longer available. The sandwich I received was nowhere near the quality I am used to with this place. I absolutely loved Submarinos, but I don't think I'll be returning.

That being said, I am not saying others shouldn't try them. I cannot speak to the quality of the rest of their offerings at this time, but I know it was top notch before."}
{"text":"I brought pizza, wings, and garlic knots to a work meeting today. We ate every last bite. The BBQ Chicken pizza and mango habanero wings were the top picks. The garlic knots are some of the best I have ever had. It was a large order but everything was ready on time. We will definitely be ordering from them again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best mom & pop pizza shop in the area. The owners are friendly and usually come check on you during your meal to ensure you are enjoying their food. The pizza special is a great deal, 2 slices of pepperoni & a drink for $5. I like to come here once a week for lunch. The place is always clean and they have good A/C too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were trying to figure out something to eat and this is in walking distance from our house so he left go grab a few slices of pizza and he got me the ham and provolone sub. I'm simple, so mine is good, his pizza is amazing! Seriously such good food!"}
{"text":"$53.00 large supreme, 20 wings, fries & lasagna. twice this week we wanted to try this place but their debit machine was down. ordered went to bank got cash picked up. pizza had no flavor. fries were sad & droopy. wings smelled & tasted burnt. lasagna was not so famous. the people were nice. will not be going back. too expensive."}
{"text":"Came in tonight for pick up the staff were all outstanding the owner and his wife really made my Daughter's (2) and I feel like we were family and important. Now for the best part the food. We got  calzones they were the best we have ever had from any where . We also got 3 slices of pizza 1 of them being the white Blanco my wife and daughter said it was awesome. This place takes a lot of pride in there food and care about their customers."}
{"text":"Meh... never consistent taste depends on who makes it i think. Staff kinda rude. I asked for an antipasta salad and i think i got half a head of lettuce barely cut up and it was just MEH like i said. Nothing on the salad was good it was basic meats out of a package just not worth ordering at all. Walk to frys buy a bag of lettuce. Wings ok one time not the other and pizza is good if its not but not so much out of their ready to go case."}
{"text":"Very friendly people that own this place. Nice little mom and pop sandwich and pizza place. Wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"Went to Submarino's yesterday after seeing them on the morning news.  What a fabulous family owned gem!  Had the all you can eat pizza, salad and garlic knots special and even though we arrived close to 1pm (which is when this lunch special ends) and there were 4 pizzas for us to choose from, the owner (I assume he was the owner) asked that we choose any pizza on the menu so that he could offer it at the buffet for us to try!  We picked the supreme which was loaded and delicious!  The salad was fresh as well, which is often not the case at a lunch buffet.  Reviewed the menu and there is not one dinner item that reaches the $10.00 mark!  And they offer small entrees for even less money!  Can't wait to go back to try out more goodies!!And I can't post this without saying that everyone there behind the counter was super friendly!  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The pizza, the salads, the wings, the chicken parmigiana. Yes we have had it all!! The spot is clean, staff in friendly! They do not serve beer..... yet. Only slightly bad thing is the pizza is a little greasy. One of our favssss!!!"}
{"text":"Great slices all day. Service is great and the place is always spotless.
Give this Mom & Pop a try."}
{"text":"We have ordered from these guys several times and they have never been perfect, (forgot a salad, wrong pizza slice, closed early because of something or other, out of eggplant, cc machine broke cash only, etc. Took it as new small business growing pains and I want to try and support small folks. Anyway, they had a good selection of slices a few months ago, however now it is down to just 2 or 3, still good slices. Anyway, call today and spoke with Joe who from the beginning has an attitude and tells me cash only because cc machine is broken, it was broken 2 weeks ago? I own 2 small business and it doesn't take 2 weeks to get a new one unless your credit is shot. But, I said no problem ok. This time only 2 types of slices, ahh that's ok. Then we ordered an eggplant dinner. I asked if we could switch from spag to penne and this seemed to upset Joe. So then Joe tells me its a $1.00 extra for penne, now spag or penne is like a buck a box, its like switching from a coke to a root beer. so I decline and decide ya know what, I have tried to support these guys for the past few months and received at most fair service and Joe was being rude. So I tell Joe please forget the order and he then calls me a dick and hangs up. Well this dick will be eating and peeing elsewhere from now on. In addition, I will inform all my tree peeing friends to do the same."}
{"text":"We love their Stromboli and calzone, quality cheeses and meats and they are very generous about it too! Also, don't pass up on getting the zeppole (deep fried Italian donuts!) with chocolate sauce. Again, Very generous with their portions! Oh and the zeppoles are best enjoyed piping hot!!! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Since they have changed owners, they are not as good as they use to be. Their serving sizes have decreased and their customer service is very poor. If you are going to order here, I highly suggest taking it to go"}
{"text":"If I could score lower I would, just called to place an order and they said they were closed, even they close at 9pm...its 8:15pm... First time to try them, last time too...poor service - I guess the staff wants to go home already...???"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here,  and the food is wonderful again!   The new display on the counter with the garlic knots and other items inside definitely works. ...the garlic knots were yummy! ! The new owners were as welcoming and friendly on this visit as our first and the pizza and wings deal can't be beat.  We'll be back many more times to come"}
{"text":"So after much encouragement from fellow Yelpers to give this place another shot as the ownership had changed I have to say I still feel the same as I did the first time. I ordered the sausage supreme sub this time and it was pretty bad. It lacked luster, flavor, a sauce, SOMETHING!!! I could only eat half of my sub, it did nothing for me....  I was hopeful, I really was. :-/

***3rd Update*** So we tried their pizza this time. Opted for their super white pizza. I have to say their pizza surpassed their subs (slightly). When I called in my order the lady on the phone was all orgasmic about how good their super white pizza is and how she eats one slice of it every day. It was okay. WAY too oily from the olive oil they slathered all over it. I couldn't even say it was cheese grease, nope, slathered in oil. Not to mention there was supposed to be sausage on it. We were lucky to have gotten one or two pieces of sausage per slice. Idk. I really want to like this place but it just doesn't seem to be in the cards for me. Oh well!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried submarino's and were pleasantly surprised! We are from New York and have been looking for New York style food.. He got the buffalo chicken sub and fries. The sub was great, very similar to an actual chicken finger sub from buffalo. I ordered the calzone, and couldn't believe how enormous it was when they brought it out. It is definitely enough for 2-3 people. The calzone was delicious and cooked perfectly. Another table got pizza and wings, and that looked incredible also. The staff was friendly, and the place was clean. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time here and it's awesome!! Staff is friendly unlike other most other pizza places! Pizza is yummy!!! And definitely telling everyone about it!! Good pizza in a clean atmosphere friendly service! Great environment for families! Excited because we will be ordering the Gino Monday for a gathering! So much cleaner and better service then Napolies (hope I spelled it right off of 35th Ave and thunderbird) and all you can eat Lunch buffet $7.99 can't beat that! Definitely coming back!!! They will be on the news on Aug 28, 2017!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Wings!! This is one of my FAVORITE spots after smoking a fat joint. Joe is a great employee give him a raise!!"}
{"text":"I didn't start out hating Submarinos.  Quite the opposite i loved it!! The food, the staff and the owners wife wowed me my first few visits. It was my new favorite Italian joint. Then, one Sunday I tried to call an order in. Kept getting a message that the business wasn't accepting calls. So i drive down to go in person to place my order. I tell them about the phone problem and the response ,\" we know, you just have to keep calling.\"
Ok. Next visit, same thing on a sunday, call, message says not accepting phone calls. I drive down, NOW THEY'RE CLOSED ON SUNDAY!
Next visit. I call an order in, go to pick up. They are only taking cash. I have to go to an ATM to get cash and go back. I mention the phone again. Same response,  \"We know\"
Last time I call, 3 weeks later to place another order and it's still cash only.
Sorry Submarinos. You are just to difficult to do business with. We will never attempt to bother you again."}
{"text":"I Love this place! Best Philly, BLT & Meatball sub I've ever had! The pizza is awesome as well! The wings are also great w/ good sauces like Mango Habenero & Honey Siracha. Service is quick & friendly every time."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Glendale. I eat here at least once a week and have for years. Everything on the menu is great although I stick to the same thing most of the time. Service is friendly and the prices are right. If you want a sandwich or a pizza or most Italian dishes in a casual setting you can't go wrong here. We even used Submarinos for our wedding reception and they were GREAT as I expected they would be. I will continue to dine here as long as they are in business."}
{"text":"Am I really seeing five star raves from other reviewers?

Well either I ate at the Submarinos in a parallel universe or I just ordered the wrong item, because nothing about my veggie pizza was deserving of five stars.  I'm only giving two stars because the folks were accommodating, kind, and offer delivery.

The menu says veggie pizza comes with olives, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers, but we paid extra for three more toppings.  This pie should be pretty tasty, right?

Before I get to that, let me regress a little...Have you seen those 1980's Wendy's commercials \"Where's the beef?\"  Well picture the vegetarian version \"where's the veggies?\"  Because THAT was my first reaction when I saw the pizza pie.  

The veggies were chopped so small -
How small were they?

They were so small that I could have snorted all the toppings and still not have gotten the recommended nutritional daily allowance.

They were so small that I mistook them for the sprinkles that you put on cupcakes.

They were so small that I thought maybe I was going senile and actually ordered a cheese pizza.

There were so small -
No, seriously, they were small.  And covered in a thick blanket of cheese.  But that's not the worse part.

As I ate the first slice, with each bite I was like...hmmmm...there's something about this pizza.  What's the word I'm looking for?  It's on the tip of my tongue.  Oh, what's that word?  This is what I was thinking the whole time.  Then I finished the slice and it came to me.  Bland.

The pizza was bland."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Wings, zucchini and subs.  Terrific personal service every time
Another great dinner, service, food....love this place"}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place out, they had great food that was made to order.  Staff was on top of their game.
Restraunt was very clean with a great atmosphere.
If i could give it a 10 I would"}
{"text":"VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!  During my recent visit, I placed an order for one entree to go.  The employee took my order and charged me for the meal.  Twenty minutes later, I asked for a status on my order and was told the employee never submitted the order.  I asked for a refund at which time I was told that my order could be filled in two minutes. Never once did management apologize for the error but rather told me the employee made a mistake because he was new.  I have been a frequent customer at this location even prior to the recent change in ownership and know the employee has worked here for at least 2 or 3 years.  I can overlook a mistake but management had little concern for the error and didn't even offer a discount or a drink.  The manager walked away immediately after refunding my money and couldn't be bothered to courteously listen to my concern.  I can overlook human error but poor management and lack of customer service will keep me from eating here again."}
{"text":"Overall I was impressed with the quality and speed that the food was presented to us. The order was fairly inexpensive and would come back again due to the convenient location"}
{"text":"The new owners are definitely doing something right because the food here is BOMBBB. I'm glad that I gave this place another chance. I totally recommend coming here and trying it out."}
{"text":"Who would have thought a little sandwich shop in a strip mall had the best tuna fish in town....well they USED to. I had not been here in a while (atleast since the new ownership transpired). I went in today and ordered the tuna and the recipe is not the same. 
***Please new owners, make the tuna how the previous owners did... there was a winner in that sandwich!"}
{"text":"A  good  quick  place  for   a  slice.   I  have  been  a   fan  for years and  the  place is   clean and  fast     Beer  people can  get  a  cold one  with their pie      Check it out"}
{"text":"My first time here I always heard good things about this place and finally decided to check this place out I got there meat ball sub let me tell u it's the best sub I have ever had the sauce was perfect everything was seasoned good it was served really nice not sloppy like many places I been to hands down will definitely be back to explore more of the menu I would recommend you to try this place out"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed there meatball sub sandwich. It hit the spot and was worth the price."}
{"text":"When they first opened I ate there all the time and the food and service were great. I still eat there about once or twice a month but quality has dropped a little."}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best subs that you can get in Phoenix. Not to mention they also have very good pizza. Staff are friendly. Anyone within the area should give this place a try."}
{"text":"There's a spot in my heart where Submarino's lives.... I used to go to the old location all the time, but it took me forever to make my way to the new location. Finally made it a couple months ago. I got their lasagna lunch special that comes with a salad (with that super yummy vinegar -y italian dressing), garlic bread, and lasagna for under 10$. The husband got pizza (and even got a teacher discount)...our whole meal was far under 20$... I think under 15. Insanity! You can't beat the prices. The lasagna, as always, was tasty and cheesy. This isn't anything fancy, but it is good. The restaurant reminds me of little Italian food places in Philly that serve casual Americanized Italian food, and I love that! Check it out, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Some co-workers and I decided to stop here to try out their food and help support a local business. 

The dining area is very clean and staff was very friendly. Now to the most important part: the food. We all wanted to try something different, so we got a couple pepperoni pizza slices, a philly, and wings. The food quality is SPECTACULAR and very competitively priced compared to similar restaurants. You can tell they use quality ingredients and put care into developing the food they sell. 

This is definitely going to be my go-to pizza place from now on. Can't wait to try their cannoli next time!"}
{"text":"I have been into this restaurant quite a few times since moving into the area. I have always been treated as family and welcomed with greetings and conversation with the owners. The food is far above any other place I have visited for pizza or subs. I have tried about half the menu and not received a bad or even questionable meal yet. Keep up the fantastic work. You had me at pizza !!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food is fresh. Place is clean. Great customer service. Got the number 1 and my gf got the number 7. We love it. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Glendale this year and I remembered this place being by the Domino's years ago. My boyfriend said he wanted an authentic and greasy pizza so we went to give it a try! And we were so, so, sooooo pleased! The wings were delicious! so saucy and cooked perfectly! And the pizza was just as delicious and satisfied my boyfriend's craving. Definitely New York style. I think this will be our new pizza spot to hit up. :p oh, and the lady working was so nice and it looked pretty cute on the inside! Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from here and it was also our last. For starters, when my wife went to pick up the pizzas she realized that there was a pizza special that the guy on the phone did not make her aware of. She mentioned it to the cashier who kind of shrugged and said \"sorry I didn't take your order\". So rather than doing the right thing and giving us the special she decided to just ring it up as is.

The pizzas themselves were horrible. The crust was very chewy and right now the pizza is sitting at the bottom of my stomach like a rock. There are far too many other pizza restaurants to eat at next time."}
{"text":"Excellent Parmesan sandwich, pizza and their marinara was amazing! Employees very friendly."}
{"text":"While my sub was not fantastic the service was. I want to go back and check out some of the other subs. Maybe my choice was just a dud! Seriously the service here was amazing! So friendly and accommodating. I will review again when I go back."}
