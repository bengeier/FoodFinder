{"text":"Food was good. Also you get to taste beers before you buy them so that is great!!! I would totally recommend stopping in and checking it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Attended there for an office party for my wife's job let me say not impressed. Beer was ok but food and service terrible. They spilled ketchup on one of the guest, another found plastic in the mashed potatoes the manager was made aware and tried to rectify the issues. Salads came out after the entrees people who were supposed to get desserts finally was asked when everyone was ready to leave. As for myself I had the Blue burger sirloin it was luke warm. I have driven by this place many times and will continue to drive by never to enter again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly cheese fries....
  Very bad.  My wife and took three bites and almost got sick."}
{"text":"Good looking bar and big restaurant. It's of the food was ok but my turkey burger came out undercooked my sons cheeseburger was undercooked too when we asked it for it to be well done.  Guess you should ask them to cook your poultry meal past 170 degrees and order your burger extra well done for well done?  Probably just one inexperienced cook this day.  Again, great bar and beer selection."}
{"text":"So I am a out of towner, referred by my coworkers. I had the Belgian Burger and sweet potato fries..all I can say is \"Yummy\""}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, food is only OK most of the time. Can be busy depending on their specials going on or whether there is a game on. Come for the beer...."}
{"text":"Wish I could review the beer and the food separately.  

The beer was outstanding.  If you are looking for a good place to get a beer, this place has a selection second to none.

The food, on the other hand, was extremely underwhelming.  Would not recommend this place for food to anyone.  

Of the four orders we placed, only the pizza my son ordered was good.  Everything else had problems.  The mussels were undercooked.  And my wife and I both ordered from the Oktoberfest specials menu.  Our spatzle was completely not cooked - tasted like hunks of bread dough that they forgot to actually drop into boiling water (who knows, maybe they did forget?).  My sauerkraut was awful, and my wife's pulled pork was also not particularly good."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich's and wide array of beers to choose from. Daily specials and plenty of Belgian beers."}
{"text":"We arrived around 10:30 on Friday.  There was a quiet hum.  Tables were full, but the overall atmosphere was relaxed and low key.  The Belgium beer selection is excellent!  Our server was knowledgeable and offered great recommendations, suggesting drinks there were not on the menu.  Late night food menu offered a few discounted items.  The wings with a variety of sauces did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great beer!  Chicken salad, brew a burger, pizzas, chicken avocado great choices.  Soup not the best."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visit often and have tremendous service every time. The manager, Lyle, is very nice, and Megan and Amanda, two of the bartenders, are extremely friendly. The beer selection is great, and changing the happy hour to include craft beer everyday has been an awesome addition. It's a little pricy, but definitely worth it. We're vegan, so we can't recommend too much food, but the frites are delicious!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review, but her it goes.  I have been a fan of the Sharp Edge since the mid 1980s when my friend Scott and I went almost weekly for about 5 years and enjoyed tasting what was at that time the only wide ranging beer taps in Pittsburgh.

In the past year I have had bad experiences at three different Sharpe Edge locations.  In this review I will only discuss the extremely embarrassing situation at the Brasserie.

I have been a regular at this location since it opened, coming here almost weekly to check out the new taps, being a bit of a beer snob.  I had become familiar with the managers and this day I think it was Chris who was working the bar.  

I had sampled several beers and bought one.  A division director from the company where I worked had stopped by join me ...his first visit to the Brasserie.   I immediately bought him one of the beers I was drinking.    Once we finished those beers my co-worker asked to try several samples.  Upon asking for the second sample the Manager, Chris said \"I just can't keep pouring you samples\".      

Now understand that until this particular day and time this bar had always graciously provided 1/2 to one ounce samples any time anyone would ask....for the over 20 years I have been going to this chain of establishments.  I questioned him about this and he became increasingly rude in his responses.  He stuttered on about the cost of beer and that 'ownership\" has been working to change this policy.   I felt completely embarrassed for myself and my co-worker. I asked for my check and left.  I vowed NEVER to come back another Sharp Edge establishment. I broke that once to meet some fronds and my wife at the Creekhouse location earlier this year.  That is another horrifying tale.     

Let me just say this.  I understand if there was a change in policy.  It would have been appropriate of this MANAGER to politely let me know of the change.  I do think this policy change is foolhardy. I will give my business to their competition who will give me samples(BOCKTOWN BEER in ROBINSON) , and now there are several new beer emporiums that have better food, tap selection and staff that DO provide free samples.

A quick note on their food.  I have never been a fan of their food except for the white pizza.  In recent years they have industrialized their food, pre-making it in a central kitchen.  It is substandard even by basic bar food standards and it is EXTREMELY overpriced. 

Sorry Sharp Edge, no more second (third) chances.   

Check my review out of the Sharp Edge Creekhouse to learn about that debacle.  Horrible service and server, sub par food and another clueless manager."}
{"text":"Sharp Edge is a beer lovers dream! They have literally hundreds of beers to choose from (dozens - yes dozens - of which are on tap). You have to be careful though, as the Belgian beers are tasty, strong, and expensive. You can easily spend a lot of money, as well as need someone to come pick you up.

The food is also very good, although I believe it to be a bit overpriced. I love their Flemish Onion soup. The burgers and grinders are excellent. I also enjoy their pizzas. For appetizers I recommend their buffalo bites (great with their chunky blue cheese!), and the Mediterranean Nachos. Appetizers are half price after 10pm, which is a great deal.

This is a great place to watch any sports games, as they have 3 large HDTVs above the bar. They also run specials during the Steelers games. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and great beers. The food is always fresh, not the fast food garbage or stuff you get from chain restaurants. I've tried the Belgian, bison, shrimp and Turkey burgers here. All to perfection. It's also kid friendly because they have homemade chicken bites. We've had the pizza as well and it's average. Service is always on point. There's also never a wait; not because the food isn't good though but because of the location. If a friend hadn't told me about the mcmurray sharp edge I wouldn't have known it was there. Hopefully they don't close because the food is good and they had a back room to accommodate large parties. When family was in town we came here for dinner. Everyone was happy in our party of 18. I've not tried the desserts yet.... Too full from the meal"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, not so great food!  I wouldn't bother eating here, but if you're interested in trying new beers, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is better than I remember when I first visited October 2008.  Great selection of belgian beer and food.  30 belgian taps change every 2 weeks and bottles rotate monthly.  Customers of all ages, chill, dim-lighting, TVs at the bar, and a beer store.  $10 off a mixed 6-pack!

Every one of their 30 belgian beers on tap has its own labeled goblet/glass it's served in.  Awesome.

Food includes starters, soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, specials, and desserts.  They go international as well.  This time, I had the 3 german potato pancakes (4\" diam) with sour cream and apple sauce ($6.97).  Perfect combination of salt, sweet, sour, fried goodness.   I hope to be back to try the ostrich burger.  

I'm telling you.  Visit Sharp Edge.  Just be careful when you visit the website though.  It is not current.  I mentioned one of my favorite belgians on the site, Duchesse De Bourgogne, and it along with others were not available. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

What follows is my take on a \"few\" belgian darks and bocks I had.  I'm not a fan of IPA's (yet) so if that's what you're looking for, skip the rest of this review.  

It's happy hour time, bar seats completely taken, and booths were filling up.  We don't even take up a third of the place but it is busy.  Still, I felt like I was given personal attention.  Mark and Ravyn, you rock! 

I tell Ravyn my likes, I want a flight of belgian, $14, (imported, $10), and she recommends the following:

-Leffe Brown (lef-feh broon):  caramely, smooth, no filmy after taste.
-Grimbergen Double: I love this more than the Leffe.  Malty, slight citrus.  Mark mentions afterwards that it has lemon zest.  No wonder it's good!  I'm taking some home.
-Wittekerke: light wheat beer, alright for my taste.  I'd still rather have a Franziskaner Weisse.
-Maredsous 8: not sour like Ravyn mentioned.  Just a nice smooth malty beer.

I've only been here for 30 minutes and Mark is droppin' knowledge on Belgian beer and handing me a sample of Petrus..supposedly the \"sour\" one.  It's slightly sour and amazingly clean.  I say slightly because my palate is used to vinegar (Filipino foods).  I could use more Petrus in my diet.

2nd flight after discussions with Mark:

-Chimay white (had before):  clean, a little hoppy in comparison to the 1st flight I had but still my fave Chimay (then blue, then red).
-Delirium Tremens (had before): belgian fruity for sure.  Good stuff.
-Delirium Nocturnum (had before): slightly more sour than the Tremens but dark in color.  Misleading.  I like that surprise factor.  I remember now why I like this one.
-Leute Bok: warm by the time I finished my food.  My bad.  Still good, tastes like the leffe brown but definitely a bock...sweeter.  I'd have again.

Mark says about belgian beer:  \"They knock up the alcohol and then candy it to mask the high percentage\"  Whatever it is, I love it, all of it.

Thanks, Ravyn and Mark, for the schoolage on your beer and making a girl feel welcome.  

*walks away with a mixed 7-pack* Yes, 7.  I took the $10 discount and bought another.  No other choice as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"The servers are very knowledgeable about the beers available. The Flemish onion soup is a fan favorite. This place is much bigger than it appears outside. There is also a really cool beer room at the entrance of the brasserie that makes a great introduction to the wonderful world of beer tasting. Just be careful....if you're a coors light drinker...this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was surprised that this location had fallen below 3 stars. I now see why it has gone so low. I am very impressed by the quantity of delicious beers that are available, but why can't you get someone in here that knows how to; #1.  Cook, #2. Create a menu that would pair well with the show case world class beers. 

The service we experience was very friendly but there where periods that we were wondering what happened to our server. Maybe the layout of the dining room makes for hard work for the servers because it is like a maze if walls to get from one area to the other. 

The mussels we had as an appetizer were sub par and definitely not worth the price. As far as the entrees are concerned there was almost too much \"stuff\" to choose from. All of which I really didn't find too appetizing so I went with the portobello mushroom burger that had some blue cheese on it, it was okay. The special lady had some sort of chicken club sandwich that was also only okay the chicken was cooked a little overdone an the bacon was very undercooked! Yuck that was gross! Should have sent it back on that premise alone but just picked off the bacon and ate the rest of it. 

Way to expensive for what you get. Not sure I will ever come back here again no matter how good their beers are."}
{"text":"Great pub food.  Fairly slow service, and an incredible beer selection.  Octoberfest food selection going on currently.  Need more wait staff!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time was for trivia a few years ago. Last week I went with a friend at about 11:30 AM. Nobody was there so it was easy to get in and out. Beer selection was pretty solid. Some beers were kinda overpriced ($10 for Terrapin Wake N Bake? No thanks) but most were reasonable. I ordered the Edge Chicken which was good but not quite as hot as I had hoped for. Description says it has \"ghost pepper cheese\" on top. Habanero is usually as hot as I go but I just didn't think it was hot at all. Service was fine but again, nobody was really in there so it may vary. Overall I was again satisfied. I will definitely go back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon for a bite for lunch since we were in the area.  First time visitors so we didn't know what to expect.  Glad we did - around 50 beers on tap, Pens game was just coming on, we had a BOGO coupon,...life couldn't get any better.  We each had a burger - she had the Belgian, a super flavorful lamb burger (done medium well), while I had the Piggy Bac - a mix of ground infused bacon.  Both were delish!  We had asked our server who happened to be the bartender as well - [I think her name was Megan (covered in tats)] - if they could cut each burger in half so we could share.  They did so, and served them with a half on each plate - how accommodating! The burgers came \"naked\" with just what was mentioned on the menu on them.  We thought this was a little odd,...then they brought out the fresh condiments on a separate cold plate so they wouldn't get soggy.  Mine came with some fresh cut fries - eat these quick or they'll start to wilt.  My \"date\" swapped out her fires for a cup of the red pepper bisque - that was a really good decision.

For the beer, we decided to go with the $15 taster rack; four 5.5 oz glasses of any draft you want. Not a bad one in the bunch. Once delivered, Megan (who was also super knowledgeable about the beer) recommended going from the light to dark so as to not screw up our palates; the ice water helped cleanse them as well.  They also have a \"mystery brew\" - $4.50 for a mason jar of a mystery beer.  Maybe next time.

All in all, a good day.  After the BOGO and the tip, about $40 considering that $15 was for beer.  Big question - would I go back?  ABSOLUTLEY! More to try on both menus."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in after a basketball game.  There were 9 of us in total.  The place did not seem very busy though they implied it was. There were tables open every where.  The hostess seated our group in an empty dining room which none of us liked. Server took 10 min to visit the table and 25 min to get drinks to the table. As we proceeded to order the server told us about what was not available from the menu, in this case seemed like 1/2 menu.  This is third visit in a row over 3 months were we visited this place to be told mussels were not available even though it is their signature dish. We tried ordering a few other dishes. When told they were not available we paid for drinks and left for Pizzaz down the street. Third horrible experience at Sharpe Edge in a row will not bother again. Shame we eat out 2-3 times per week but the place not managed well."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for dinner, halfway between my daughters and my own home.  The Sharp Edge was recommended, so six of us had dinner there.  We were not disappointed.  Happy Hour prices were fabulous!  The waitress was super efficient and made sure we were aware of Happy hour ending, so we could get in our last drink orders.  The burgers, for the most part, were awesome.  (the only one we had complaints about was the Piggy Bac, which tasted like ground hot dogs)  I would imagine they would have taken it back, had we mentioned that at the time.  Fortunately the burgers were large enough that we had plenty to share, and bring some home too.  Although they were pricey burgers (15.00), we enjoyed our meal, the wait staff and our evening.  Oh, the pudding is HUGE and with 6 spoons, we even left some of that!  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in around 7 on a Wednesday night. Was super excited to try their wings!! The bar section was pretty full and it seemed to be moderately busy on the dining side. My boyfriend and I stood by the host stand/front area for 5-10 minutes waiting for a host or worker to come greet and seat us, but it never happened! Not sure why there wasn't someone up front at that time, but needless to say we weren't going to stand around and wait to be seated for any longer. 

Pretty sad I couldn't have tried their wings!! Customer service needs a major overhaul here."}
{"text":"SUPER EXPENSIVE but otherwise nice selection of Belgian and craft beers. Food is decent, service can be good or meh depending. I honestly prefer the atmosphere in other Sharp Edge locations, but they've done ok with their strip mall spot. Did I mention, expensive?"}
{"text":"Great service with an extensive beer selection and good pub fare.  Pretty good combination, if you ask me.  Plus, they have extra specials during Penguins and Pirates games, which offers some decent promotional discounts. 

This place was crowded when we arrived, yet we were seated quickly and were well-attended to throughout our meal. 

Not sure why this place has such negative reviews, as I'd recommend it if you're looking for pub food and beer and are in the area.  

3.5 Stars...but giving it 3, since there's no half rating and it's not really worthy of 4.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have been an intermittent customer of this place for at least the past 5 years.  The beer selection is good. The service is \"iffy\", and the food is less than what one would expect for the prices. If you are on a liquid diet, this is the place to be!! Hopefully they can get their cooks to prepare the food to taste the way they describe it on the menu. I only visit there because I know at least the beer is good!"}
{"text":"We love the sharp edge in mcmurray! It's never too busy and it's a great selection of beer! We love the burgers."}
{"text":"Was at this location tonight. Horrible!!!! Sat at the bar from 7:35-7:50 and not one person was working behind it. Got up and left after the bartender came out and chatted up the people next to me. Bar had maybe 7 people out of the 20 stools. Crazy! 

Wish I could say this is unusual but it's very frequent here. Generally good bartenders and beer but horrible management!!!"}
{"text":"We had some time before we needed to work an event, so we wanted to grab a quick drink and bite to eat. My friend had been to other Sharp Edge locations and said it was great and it was close to our work location. So we sat at the bar for faster service. That was our first mistake. The service was incredibly slow. 

We only ordered provolone wedges and onion soup and it took forever to come out. I would have been fine with that if my provolone wedges were handmade to order. However, they were disgusting and came right out of a box in the freezer AND WERE $7.50. Give me a break! Unfortunately I did eat these and did not ask to speak to a manager or get anything else because we were already pushing it with the time we had to be at work. 

I may recommend this place to anyone that likes beer, but would advise not to order food."}
{"text":"We live in Peters and were hoping to find a local spot that we could count on for a late bite to eat. We liked the atmosphere and the fact that we could be casual and watch sports. However after trying the McMurray Sharp Edge we will never go back. The service is so horrible it is beyond description. We were brought flat pop twice even after we sent it back. My fried fish came burnt....can't even believe a waiter would serve something looking like that. My husband ordered a salad that was supposed to have many different types of lettuces in it and it came with only Romaine and a few bits of veggies thrown in. The food took so long to come that on our last trip we left.........such a shame.....we would love to have a local pub to call our own."}
{"text":"My parents just moved to a house very close to here so we stopped in for a quick lunch.  I was excited to see what options they had since I assumed it would be my go to place when visiting my parents.  

Beer
I did not get anything to drink, but looked through their tap list and bottle list.  Very impressive.  I'm shocked that a place like this exists in the burbs.  The prices can have some sticker shock, but that is the way it goes with Belgian Beers.  The happy hour 1/2 off special is a really great deal and I definitely plan on taking advantage of that.

Food
I got a cup of the spicy black bean soup and a turkey rueben.  both were good and I wouldnt hesitate to order again.  everyone at the table enjoyed their food.  my mom got a portabella mushroom salad, and while it was good, it was lacking some of the extra 'stuff' that makes a salad a real entree.  other than that no one really had any complaints on the food. 

Service:
Good although we were about the only people there for a 2:30pm lunch on a Wed.  

Ambiance:
Clean and nice.  Doesn't really feel like a belgian beer bar, feels more like a \"Joe's Sports Bar\" that was turned into a belgian beer bar.  Not a real knock on the place, since its still nice and clean."}
{"text":"Last experience was vastly improved.  Back on my list of places to go.  Service was better, which was the main issues they had in the past.  Buffalo blue bites are the go to."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to come and hang with friends and have a few drinks. The whole place is centered around beer. The moment you wake in there is a wall of beer to the right. At the bar there are two additional cooler also filled with beer, both import and domestic. Need less to say the also have a good number of beer on draft.
Bottom line if your that into beer there is not a huge reason for you to come here. Not to discourage their food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  The past couple times,  the service had a lot to be desired.  This time they have totally redeemed themselves!  I'm a long time diner here because I love their food and beer selection.  The wing bites are amazing as well as the sweet potato fries.  Service this time was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ok My Second Visit here was the BEST !!! GREAT Food & Beer Selection. Fun Place .
I'm a fan. I would recommend trying this place.
Nice Pittsburgh Local Business. The Staff was very friendly and helpfull too.
East to find and park too."}
{"text":"Friendly service for sure, but there was one issue: I ordered two bottles of Stone Ruination at $8 each, and the \"enjoy by\" date was 10 months ago!"}
{"text":"What a great Place! On my wife and I's go to places. There are so many craft beers, it's fantastic. 
The service was really good. We didn't have to wait and they checked up on us often. 
The Food, was so good. My wife got the Mussels. Some of the best I have had. We actually ended up ordering g2 order of mussels for take out two nights later. 
I got the bleu burger. It was an actual bleu burger, not just some bleu cheese sprinkled on it. And the fried pickles were fries up perfect. What a great experience. Like I said, it is now on our Go To Places. We will be going often. 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I think the main two reasons I like this place are because 1) It took a strip-mall location and made it feel like it's own building and 2) The wide selection is pretty unique for this vicinity. Not *amazing* compared to bigger city selection maybe, but pretty good for an area that generally seems satisfied with Miller and Coors (don't hate me for that pretentious comment--I'm actually from the area originally).

Atmosphere isn't astounding overall maybe, but doesn't feel like a strip mall, so that's a plus.

Service is generally very friendly. Especially the females (and I almost never single out a gender in a comment like that). :)

Hope this place stays open."}
{"text":"To call this place a \"restaurant\" would be very generous.  Both times I have taken my family here I have walked out thinking to myself \"that food would not have been worth it at HALF the price.\"  That's too bad, because the selection of beer on tap is pretty broad and interesting, despite the fact that the prices are way too high except during happy hour.  When it first opened, I liked the atmosphere in the place, but it seems a bit on the dirty side now, kind of beat up looking as if nobody really cares.  And every meal that we've had there has been awful.  In the future, I might stop in for a beer during happy hour, but I would never order anything from the menu again."}
{"text":"We were going to come here regardless of the reviews.  I saw a lot of poor reviews and a poor approval rating on urban spoon as well, but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised.  The server was pretty busy, but still attentive, and had a little help, so an \"A\" for service. 

We ordered the Mediterranean Nachos, and they were delicious to start.  The beer selection is great there and we knew that.  The server was knowledgeable of the beer and was able to help with selection.  We split the Hot Turkey Burger (H.T.B.), and it was outstanding.  My wife and I would definitely suggest it.

The only small criticism I had was that they need to update their draft list more often.  My wife had selected three beers and two were no longer on tap, but still a great experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my boyfriend's favorite places to go to catch a steeler's or pens game. Typically we sit at the bar-always decent service. I can now say I've tried every variety of mussels they have (mussels from Brussels, over the edge,basil and wine with garlic, and spicy sriracha). My favorite is the first one I tried there, the mussels from Brussels. The Sriracha is a little spicy for my taste but this last time the server offered bread for dipping and I'll say that was the best sauce for dipping with bread. I've also had the buffalo bites in the jerk BBQ sauce and it was perfect-not too spicy, just enough flavor...these were nice boneless wings. I've also had the same variety of sauce with bone-in wings and I personally prefer the boneless-less messy obviously. I still want to try some of the sandwiches and maybe the french onion soup so I'll have to update again once I do that."}
{"text":"If I'm being honest I had to go somewhere else, I don't think I can patronize a place who uses a font like that in a sign like that. Also, why is it all caps?

I gave four stars because it was highly recommended, so I assume it's good, but I took a * off for the font."}
{"text":"Nope, I will never dine here again.  Maybe sit at the bar for the Tripel Karmeliet and other great beer on tap, but the rest of this place is weird."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, great happy hour specials, delicious burgers and other menu items.  Great for happy hour or to watch whatever sporting event is on TV.  Service could be better, but it's not awful.  This is my go-to place if I'm craving a beer and a burger."}
{"text":"Tons of beers. Typical bar type food served. Not a beer drinker, and they don't offer great beer for us folk."}
{"text":"It is a real shame what they have done to the Peters Township location.  This place has a lot of potential, but the management and staff are just plain awful at what they do.

Service is slow and they just don't seem to care that there are actually people in the place trying to spend money.  The food used to be decent, but now is rushed and cold.  Rush hour lunch and they have one waitress!"}
{"text":"How have I missed this place for happy hour? Great service, good food in an upbeat,  friendly atmosphere. Happy hour was fun and the bar was hoppin'! I had a Fishhead punkin beer, (what even is that?), and Belgium onion soup. It came out hot and savory! I'll definitely be back, maybe even next Friday. Chicken avocado burger looks pretty tasty. Wonder what beer would go with that?"}
{"text":"If you are old enough to remember \"WHERE'S THE BEEF?\" - you'll know what I'm talking about.  

A $10 roast beef and brie panini - where's the beef?  It was pathetic and really lacked flavor and substance.  Let's call it what it really was:  toast with a thin layer of cheese and a thin strip of red meat.  Went home still famished.

Beer selection is amazing and the waitress was polite.  However, I can find good beer and much, MUCH better food elsewhere - especially in light of overly inflated prices."}
{"text":"I do have love for the Sharp Edge restaurants & my friend had never been, so I suggested we meet there. If you like/love beer - definitely a place to check out! 

Kudos to our waitress for bringing over a taster of the Deschutes Chainbreaker IPA when I told her I loved Sam Adams Cold Snap (ugh, why does that have to be seasonal?!). Chainbreaker was pretty damn good & I went with a pint. 

Foodwise I was seriously horrified that they took their beer cheese off their appetizer menu \"about a year ago\" according to our server - seriously one of THE best things from their menu, hence the lowering of stars - don't change things that work!

We both went with Buffalo Bites & the fresh cut fries, which paired well with the IPA. Yum. We shared the raspberry cheesecake for dessert, which was also very tasty. Overall, a great lunch, but the menu redo? Very disappointing."}
{"text":"If you enjoy beer and (more specifically) trying new beer, this is the place for you.  I believe they have around 80 beers on tap, and something along the lines of 400 bottled.  Food isn't too bad either... it's bar type food... but the selection beer is hard to beat.  Prices aren't too steep considering you're buying imports. I always enjoy a trip to Sharp Edge!"}
{"text":"Great beer at double to triple normal prices and revolting expensive food."}
{"text":"Excellent Belgian beer selections.  The happy hour (M-F 4:30 - 6:30) is tremendous.  Food is average but the service has always been pleasant.  I would recommend the burger as a safe option.  Taps rotate with good seasonal offerings and great overall selection of local, micro, and especially Belgian beers.  It is pricey but probably deservedly so for the beer, not so much for the food.

Kid friendly and doesn't make you feel like you are in a strip mall or the generally food-lacking south hills.  We are happy to live in the S Hills but not a ton of dining options.  This is a pleasant non-chain place to go now and then...  especially for the great beer."}
{"text":"We visited twice over a 6 month span, allowing the place a \"pass\" for the first trip. Everyone deserves a second chance, right?

Visit #1-I was served about 2\" of white wine in a glass with an apology that it was the last of what they had & that they were giving it to me. Could have dressed a salad with it. Awful, but that's what I get, I suppose. It's a BEER place! Don't recall the exact food we ate and hated, but it did involve meatloaf. 

Visit #2-we had \"Belgian Hand-cut Frites\" as an app. These were maybe hand cut by Mr. Ore Ida. Absolutely anything but hand cut fries served with 3 mystery dipping sauces: one horseradishy, one mustardish, one without any flavor whatsoever. My entree this trip was pork & sauerkraut. The last time I had my meat cut up for me was when I was 5! It was similar to a shredded pork (but bigger) on top of some kraut. Weird. Ordered BEER this time--Carlsburg bottle. It was warm. Service was very mid- to low-grade. 

God, the food is terrible! Simple as that. But they have all that BEER! The selection is absolutely mind-blowing. So, go for the beer, maybe watch the Pens game--but eat at home!"}
{"text":"I used to go here. Sadly it went down hill. Was there today for lunch and it took an hour and a half for a sandwich and a salad. Food was bad and service was  very bad. Manager said it was because they where busy as an excuse. They had four tables full. For their sake hope they really don't think that, is busy or they will tank very soon. I give them -- stars. Don't go if you want to eat or do anything with the rest of your day."}
{"text":"Decent food, but who comes here for the food??

THE BEER ROCKS!!!

Prices are a bit high but the selection is spectacular and they really know what they are talking about. Enjoy a pint or 7 with some good bar food."}
{"text":"I live relatively close to the Creekhouse and knew these were under the same ownership, but I didn't expect (or want) the menu to be the same. I should've checked before we went, I do realize this. Waitress was the only wait staff there it seemed other than the bartender. She was absolutely the host and waitress and only one I saw in the 2h we were there. Not her fault, but because of this service took what felt like forever. Earth burger was outstanding and Mediterranean nachos are always a go-to for us and didn't disappoint. Our check total was $68 though (before tip) and for what we got (really no different than other nights out) that was around $18-20 more than we would normally pay."}
{"text":"We were a party of four and found ourselves squeezed into a back booth that could easily accommodate four anorexic girls but was quite tight for adults. This place has about 50 draft beers on hand: Belgian, nitro, imported, and micro. With such a selection we decided to query our waitperson but she was rather blasé or not knowledgeable. Considering her service throughout the meal I am leaning toward blase. What ever we eventually ended up drinking wasn't memorable. To continue our unimaginative evening we all ordered the Belgian burger, a mix of lamb and sirloin, but to different degrees of doneness. I thought the taste interesting but afterward two of us did have upset stomachs. My wife wanted to try the Belgian fries while the rest of us settled for regular fries. The Belgian fries looked and tasted exactly like the regular fries but came with a different sauce. For desert we tried the Kreik Cherry Crisp. Lots of cherries but very little crisp or ice cream. A perfect end to a ho hum experience."}
{"text":"Not a bad stop at all. Nice extensive beer list, but I would have appreciated a more extensive menu as well. Sandwiches are the menu at this establishment. I will say, I ordered the mussels and they were delicious, so well done there, but otherwise just okay. Not a must the next time in the area, but certainly not a disappointment."}
