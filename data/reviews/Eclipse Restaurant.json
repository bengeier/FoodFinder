{"text":"Staying at the Aloft next door. Tried this place for the first time. Waited at the host counter for about 10 minutes. This should have been a warning, but I stuck it out. I got seated and waited about 15 minutes before the waiter came. He took my full order, and I received a beer very quickly.  After 20 minutes I received my onion soup. Sort of lukewarm. Not good, not bad.  About another 25 minutes later, the pizza arrived.  All-dressed pizza was hot and mediocre flavor. The waiter was really moving around, so maybe the kitchen was short-staffed. I won't go back.  Too many other options."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous bar service. We sat for half an hour before we were asked what we wanted and then when I asked her what was on tap she rudely said \"you actually want me to read off what we have\" Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"This place is just fine. I was there late on a Tuesday night, there were tons of servers, several of them asked me if I had been helped (I had) and people at the bar were buying drinks for people at the tables, and the bartender was pretending to uncork Chandon. It has a fun atmosphere, even if the decor is a little \"Anytown, USA.\"

The food: I had French Onion Soup. It was also fine! Served with bread and butter. They were out of my first three wine choices but I had a nice Pinot Noir.

Service was quick and attentive. Maybe I had low expectations from reading reviews here, but I was pleasantly surprised. Decent food at a decent price for an airport restaurant. Don't make a special trip out if you're at the Aloft or Sheraton and aren't super fussy."}
{"text":"Arjun was FABULOUS and so was our food. His recommendations were perfect...mushroom raviolis, arugula salad with apples and pecans and French onion soup= a great meal
I have never had better service
Thank you Arjun for making our stay/dinner enjoyable
My only recommendations would be for Arjun to spend time with Claudette at the front desk. I think he could change her service level."}

Here for Late Dinner & glass of beer - Bill was $23.77 (CA$) w/ tip

Got to the hotel about 10pm and was feeling the need for some grub.  The hotel restaurant offeres crew a generous discount and although I usually know better to eat hotel food....

I remember being here about 3 yrs ago and it being pretty darn good for a hotel restaurant.  The 3 of us (total crew) phillied up to the bar for quicker service. The kitchen is open till 11pm - which is great when your coming in late.

I ordered a Rickard's Red and I spied the baked macaroni with chorizo and Quebec cheddar.  The bar service was a little slow but the food came out pretty quick for 10:45'ish at night.

The presentation left me pretty excited, especially for being so late at night, and I was hungry.  (see pics) 

I dived into the heaping mound of cheese melted macaroni and slurped into a never ending string of cheddar.  I was awestruck with how such a wonderful looking plate could be completely devoid of any flavor what so ever.

I salted and peppered the daylights out of that dish just to get any flavor.  There was something bigger though - no amounted of flavor magnification was going to undue the elbowed shaped extruded semolina from being mush!

The chorizo was pretty decent but too few pieces were available for sampling.  The BÃ©chamel sauce was weak and flavorless.  It did add some of the obligatory creaminess to the over all dish and the overdone proteins in the wheat of the pasta added the rest.

The dinner was accompanied with small ciabatta rolls and butter.  OMG!!! the butter here is DIVINE yes I said it in all caps - that roll with butter was better than my dinner.

I saw the guy next to me had ordered the French Onion Soup - damnit I thought.  That looks great.

I'm back here tomorrow night and I know what I'm ordering all ready."}
{"text":"Not great.  Service was slow, food was disappointing; prices inflated. 
If you don't eat meat and are looking for a vegetarian-friendly option, stay away from the vegetarian pizza.  It will only make you sad.
Only redeeming feature: the bar was still open when I arrived after a LONG day of travel."}
{"text":"It's was ok. Onion soup was pretty bland, I could have made it myself. But sliders were good. 

Enjoyed atmosphere. 

Don't think I would go out of my way but a decent hotel bar/restaurant. 

May visit next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Horrendous service.  The wait staff greeted me when I walked in, but after I placed my order they totally ignored me.  After 45 mins, food finally arrived and they got my order wrong.  I asked for a soup and a salmon Ceasars med rare, and they gave me a salmon entre dinner well done.  No apologies either."}
{"text":"Good service and not bad food. I got the veggie burger which the server said took awhile because it's frozen and it was surprisingly flavorful-it tasted like Indian spices. My partner got the veggie penne which was so-so. The meals came with a free appetizer each so I got the arugula salad which was pretty good and he got the cream of broccoli soup was really good."}
{"text":"Waited 1.5 hours for our food and when it finally arrived it was cold... wasn't any point sending it back as we didn't have more time to waste. Poor server was running to help everyone.  Poor management in this part"}
{"text":"If I could go into the negatives I would. Everything tasted like it was frozen 4 minutes prior to being thrown in the microwave"}
{"text":"Service is just not good, neither is the breakfast buffet.  We stood at the front desk waiting for more than 5 minutes as several people looked at us and went about their business without even an acknowledgment. The snot rocket eggs were not just cold but actually chilled, yes like on ice cold.  Coffee was poured for us as we were finishing.  About 5 minutes after we sat we were asked if we wanted coffee, 10 minutes later we got a saucer and cup, 10 minutes after that we were about to leave and we were poured the dregs of a pot.  Would never consider again."}
{"text":"Arjun (I believe his name was) was the most accommodating and pleasant server I have ever had at a restaurant. I cannot speak on behalf of the the breakfast/lunch food and service here, but as far as the quality of food and service for dinner goes, it was nothing short of amazing. The mushroom ravioli and french onion soup are highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Eclipse restaurant is in the Sheraton at Montreal airport. For lunch they offer a buffet,  the choice is very limited 4 choices of hot meals and 4 salads,  the food dried in the heaters and was not vary tasty. For a Sheraton you would expect a better buffet. The place was clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant inside of the Sheraton airport hotel. The staff is friendly and the food is good. I had the mushroom ravioli  for lunch and it was creamy and aromatic. The pasta was cooked perfectly, but the filling needed a bit more salt. Overall it was great."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for more than 30 minutes, however all we had are simple food (sandwiches etc) The onion soup was so salty, it's hard to swallow the bread inside. When we tell the waiter we have been waited for a long time, he said \"it's very busy now other people have been waiting longer than you guys.\" Not sure this is a good way to reply customers...... However burgers and sandwiches are ok."}
{"text":"The restaurant-bar in the lobby of the Sheraton was just perfect for a late night dinner after arriving at the hotel. The food and drinks were good and the bartender was excellent!"}
