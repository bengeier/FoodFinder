{"text":"Tried to go here twice over the Christmas holiday and both times they were closed even though the website said they'd be open. When we arrived there were no signs on the door indicating they were closed. One would think they would be open the day before and the day after Christmas, but apparently this business doesn't understand demand. Very frustrated about the misinformation and the lack of signage. I do not recommend trying to go here over the holidays."}
{"text":"It is chaotic. There are separate sections for the different ages of children, but no one enforces anything. So, in the area for babies/crawlers, there are a bunch of school-aged children running around.  Same as in the toddler area.  It makes it really hard for the parents of the small children because they have to make sure that their kids aren't being knocked over by the bigger kids (whose parents aren't paying attention).  So, what you hope will be a relaxing time where you can have a cup of coffee and let your toddler play, is actually sort of stressful and exhausting. For older kids, it seems great because there are no limitations for them. It just doesn't work as well for the younger kids."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to take the kids and play. The equipment always seems clean. The layout is very open and comfortable. They have couches and areas that are even comfortable for the adults. Their food and drinks served in the cafe area are always good. Everything is offered at a great price too. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great for the younger ones. A wonderful way to expend some energy! Make sure to bring socks, or they charge $2 to buy a pair ($1 to rent)."}
{"text":"Great place for kids to play they offer a $2 military discount for each child as well. The play areas are kept clean and even when they are extremely busy there is no mess evident. What I was most amazed by however, was the ability for so many kids to get along I rarely witnessed any tantrums or fighting among children. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place, where my daughter and nephew could play for hours! The staff is nice and it's overall a fun place.  Reasons for the lower rating:  - There are way too many kids running around. They are running over the littler kids and being crazy. Their parents are too busy on their phones to care. There is no supervision at all there.   - I gets way too crowded. There needs to be a max capacity. The place isn't that big, and there are way too many kids that are running around because no one is watching them.   - Price. When we first started going there, the price was way lower and has gone up quite a bit. It is a fun place, but I have to be desperate for my kid to need something to do to pay $10 for her to play for an hour or two."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is delicious and the people are so kind. Don't forget your socks though ;)"}
{"text":"I am really torn by this place because my son loved it, he is 11 months but it kinda freaked me out.  Since he is so young we had to play in the toddler area, which is perfect.  I also understand that it says they are not responsible for the kids, I get it but it's not fair when there is clearly a sign saying kids a certain height aren't allowed in with the babies and that's where they keep going.  I watched the big kids, hit each other in the toddler area, trap a kid in a tube and make him cry, throw things at each other in a mean aggressive way probably because the other kid was smacking everyone in the face and then being aggressive towards my little guy.  The employees could at least come over and say, \"Hey, you're too big to be in this area.\"  We ended up going in the big kid's area at the end because all the big kids came over to the toddler area and were getting mad when my son wanted to play with the toys available to him.  That being said, it was a clean place and I will try it one more time because my son liked it so much.  But management doesn't  have to be responsible for the kids but they could at least be responsible for making sure that the kids are in the correct play areas for their size."}
{"text":"Great food. Very busy. You must watch your toddler carefully. There are mom's on their phone, laptops and tablets drinking their latte not watching their kids. My children had a great time. They sell thrifty ice cream, yum. The place is mostly clean. Some dust under the structure. I'm more sure how often they clean my child socks had stains. But it was fun and affordable. The bathroom was clean. I didn't eat the food but was talking to a grandparent who frequent this establishment and said it was good. We were there for 3 hours and my child fell asleep as soon as we got into the car. I say win win situation. We'll be back maybe I'll go in the evening next time. I overheard someone saying they not so busy after 1 - 4pm."}
{"text":"This play area has a lot going for it. The facilities are clean and the kids seem quite happy. Initially there was confusion when I arrived as no one was Manning the entry booth but that was worked out in short order.   Entry is $11 which I think is steep. Fortunately, there is a first time visitor coupon on the website that made our entry $6. They also seem to have deals throughout the week to make the cost more reasonable. Tuesday is Toddler Tuesday and anyone under 3 gets $2 off admission. They also have grandparents day and a few others.   My son wanted lunch from the cafe and the prices were reasonable. $4.50 for Kraft Mac and Cheese, a delicious cookie (seriously tasty), some fruit, and milk.   He was so happy we stayed over two hours. Plenty of toys and the kids playing there all seemed nice.   Overall, worth the $6."}
{"text":"My 2 year old and I love this place! Play Grounds helped us make it through the summer when we couldn't go outside to play. The food is great, the owners are sweet,  it's always clean, and it's just a fun place for kids of all ages!"}
{"text":"My daughter loved this place. It was our first visit today and I plan to revisit soon if not regularly. She's almost 2 and had zero problems with playing on the entire playground. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"A nice, inexpensive place to let your child run around and expend some energy. We went after 2pm where they have a special discounted price. Can't comment on the cafe because I get anything"}
{"text":"Most friendly staff ever, they make you feel like family.  It's the perfect place to take the kids and your laptop so you can work while they play.  Bonus, they have super comfortable sofas for sitting in. But the icing on the cake for me is the food from the cafe, it's all made from fresh ingredients daily and tastes amazing.  I would go here just to eat the food, seriously it puts many restaurants to shame. The smoothies are especially delicious.  I highly recommend this place to parents with young children."}
{"text":"Loved this place. My son had a great time. It was clean. The food and coffee was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great place to take young kids.  My son loves it! They also have a decent menu selection.   Staff is friendly and helpful.  It can get really crowded mid morning -  lunch, so be prepared for that, and socks are a must."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it's cool inside and a cafe in side as well what more can you ask for. You are at a play ground there are bound to be knock downs. The best part is that it's a clean place so I don't have to stress."}
{"text":"What a great place. A large open play area with a large climbing frame for the kids to have a romparama until their energy levels drop. I think this place could wear out the Energizer Bunny. The tables face the play area so you can do your duty as a dad without getting up!!  The food and coffee really hit the spot. Portions not too large so you don't end up feeling like a beached whale, and the kids don't get too distracted from the real task at hand, running off all that endless energy.  I love this place and wish I'd found it earlier and so do the boys. We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"PlayGrounds is awesome!  I took three kids there, all five and under, and they had a great time.  Everything is very clean. Service is great and the meals are tasty and affordable - on par with Paradise Bakery or Wildflower Bread Company. The kid meals are healthy, which is a refreshing change for me. Not a chicken nugget or a french fry in sight! :) If you have kids in lower elementary school or younger you should check this place out! It also has a great toddler play area.  The sound quality is significantly better than the typical indoor playgrounds. I never thought it could be relaxing to go to a place like this, but it ended up being a very relaxing experience - mostly because of the set up of the restaurant/cafe area and the great decor.  I can't wait until my Mom comes to visit for the winter. We are sure to be at Playgrounds on a regular basis. The kids can play and we will be able to hear each other speak over coffee. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Great place indoors to occupy kids. They have a menu and free wifi and coffee. Menu looks good but limited. The pastries are good. A little pricey when you have lots of kids but it's bright and clean (most important) and comfortable.  The staff is very nice!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Idk how I didn't find it sooner. Me and the kids played for hours. Amazing food, which is also cheaply priced. The white chocolate frapp is to die for. Also, the staff is super friendly. I can't remember their names, but one was blonde and one had a new York accent. Definitely would recommend this place. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My kiddos and I love this place! Having 4 kids it can be quite $$ so we don't always go as often as I'd like.   The cafe is amazing!  Moms/dads can order a coffee/latte and watch the little ones play. The food is great, we always have lunch.  I like to order my coffee and  watch the kids make new little friends for the day.  The couch area is great for talking with other moms/dads and just watching the kids do their thing in a safe and clean environment!  The staff has always been super friendly and the facility is ALWAYS clean.  I just returned from a 6 month deployment and the first thing my kids ask to do as a \"mom and me\" day was go to PGFZ, so it's a memorable experience, for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place!  Nice to let your kid(s) run around  & play with other kids etc. Price is fair overall!   We held our daughter's birthday here. The staff was nice & professional!  I would recommend this place to other parents! Our friends did!"}
{"text":"Awesome and affordable adults can play too. Low prices, friendly service and great for tiny tots on up. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place! My daughter loves it here and will play for hours. Food is awesome!! Staff is super friendly!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for kids AND parents. Latte and a sandwich while the kids play! Enjoy meeting up with Mom friends and their kids."}
{"text":"My 2.5 yr old had a great time. Our first visit and we will be back. However, I had my baby with me and I needed another adult to help supervise as there are lots of bigger kids that run around unsupervised and one of them pushed my daughter down. I thought it was clean most of the time. Someone did leave a chocolate milk on the ground and it did get knocked over. I would've picked it up had I not been wearing my baby and also my backpack. I had hoped to get a coffee and sit and relax while watching my daughter but I couldn't because I had to stay with her the entire time because big kids were running around terrorizing other children while their parents sat and played on their phones. If the supervision was a bit better or the rules enforced more I would give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to take your child to release energy! My daughter loves this place because they have enough space for running, little cars to hop into and pedal, and the slides, tubes, and actual playground obstacle courses are really fun too! they also have a great little menu of coffee and drink beverages to choose from, however, I am not too fond of their food menu (lot's of unhealthy foods to choose from). But other than that, a great place for your toddlers to socialize and have fun!"}
{"text":"Neat concept but over priced for what it's worth. Coffee and food were pricey and nothing to brag about. My 1 year old didn't care for it much. It's definitely geared toward toddlers to about 7 years old."}
{"text":"We've got multiple punch cards to this place. It's a fun place to go burn a couple hours, especially if you have very hyper kids. I'm a neat freak, am always inspecting base boards, counter-tops etc everywhere I go, giving each place a mental \"cleanliness grade\" (yeah I should probably be medicated). This place is always clean considering the chaos it contains on a daily bases. There breakfast sandwiches aren't anything to write home on, a little greasy (buttered bread when there is bacon and cheese involved as is). I'd buy the kids food but either not eat or buy food else where. Drinks are okay. OWNER IS ALWAYS PRESENT WHICH IS AWESOME!  The downfall (Otherwise-non 5 star): This place gets crowded, I've seen some parents not keeping track of their sometimes multiple kids, and they nearly always end up in the \"toddler area\", especially if they are still toddlers and it's a bit of a gray area. I am guilty of this, my 2 year old looks like he is 3.5, and is crazy when let loose in a brightly lit establishment made just for rolling, running, climbing and screaming mad. Especially since mom calls it the \"play area\". Well, I was getting the stink eye from one particular mom of a crawling infant. I tried controlling my wild child, but only a little since I also had his 4 year old brother to keep track of, who was on the other side of the place. He wasn't mauling her child, but rolling around in the tube close by, nearly mauling him a few times. I couldn't help but think, why is there a crawling infant within the general population of crazy running, jumping kids? No negativity towards stink eye, but something needs to be done about the management of ages. I think they need a \"infant room\". Something off to the side, gated and (loosely) managed by an employee. Possibly with a infant changing area, a bottle warmer, nursing area etc. This is why I love Ikea, but it's so far."}
{"text":"This place was a joke. Don't say Sat mornings are open play if you are gonna make people with 1 child wait to play so you can make room for parties. You should close for parties if that is who you are letting play and giving priority to. Thanks for saving me $10 on a slightly bigger McDonald's play land. Found it online, drove 35 mins one way for nothing!"}
{"text":"My son enjoys going there and I like that's the area is clean for my son. The staff were nice and made a great smoothie!"}
{"text":"Employees here is friendly. Very clean place. Reasonable pricing and the kids always have a blast :)"}
{"text":"Great place, nice and very clean with healthy food to purchase. For the parents that complain their kid got hurt by another kid or they are in the baby space, the rules are you are to watch your children. The staff is not your kids babysitters. With that said, I love the place and my granddaughter does too. She has fun playing with other children. She climbs, jumps, runs and by the end has a good night sleep, which grandma loves. I can't say enough great things about Fun Zone. Love the place."}
{"text":"I have a 3 and 1 year old and took them here recently and they had a blast! Super safe and clean. The owner runs the show and does a great job. The food is great and coffee is delicious. Great price for everything and it's awesome that it's open and you can hang back and watch your kids from the dining area or couches that surround the place and not have to constantly worry or follow them around. Will be coming back here often! They have half price Monday's until the end of the year according to the calendar on their website."}
{"text":"I love this place for the kids. I took my little ones on a Saturday. They close at 2 pm. I would give them a 5 star rating if they closed a bit later...like 5 or 6 pm. It was a bit crowded with adults. Maybe if they closed later people wouldn't all go at the same time. Something management should consider. I like that they have coffee and food. The caramel machiato was pretty good. Im glad you could bring your own water because if your kids are anything like mine, sweaty, then you know how important that is. I \"snuck\" my water bottle in, then realized it was perfectly legal . Buy your tickets on their website to save money, especially if you're a first time customer."}
{"text":"Pretty fun place for kids and they are friendly but not sure it is worth the money. If your kids didn't nap and you were content sitting there for a few hours, it's worth it but after about an hour or so, it gets crazy busy and my kids get kind of bored. We go about once a month."}
{"text":"Excellent place for any kid under 10. The staff is always cleaning and serving and really easy to order from. The place is clean, well-configured, and comfortable for parents to sit and watch. I want to emphasize CLEAN. Any kid place always smells and is inevitably dirty in at least some areas but this place is so clean and doesn't stink! It's rare for a kid place! In addition, the food is honestly amazing. It is always fresh and there are so many options. Everything we've ever ordered was DELICIOUS!! They also offer many coffee options which are really good; mocha, latte, reg coffee...i've had them all! Seriously good! We love this place. We drive 40 minutes to come here. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to the place and I thought it was wonderful! I took my 10 month old daughter and she really enjoyed it. That being said, this business isn't catered toward infants so you will have to keep them out of the way for the intended target market of toddler - 8 year olds.    I will agree with other reviewers in that the play zone is smaller than I expected. However, I think this makes it easier to keep an eye on your children, so I don't find it to be a negative. The place was clean and the staff was cognizant of improper play (a girl was sitting on the roof of one of the Playskool foot propelled cars and told to get down). Some reviewers mentioned that bigger kids were in the toddler area and the staff should enforce the restrictions. During my visit, there were some bigger kids in the toddler zone but their parents were nearby reminding them to be mindful of the babies. So, I think the onus is on the parents and not on the staff because this isn't a daycare.    Lastly, I only got a mocha frappaccino at the cafe and thought it was as good as one from Starbucks only cheaper!  All in all, this is a good place to spend some time with your kids when it's too hot to go to the park!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. The layout, the cafe, the playground, everything. I wish there were more places like it! Moms & dad's are able to enjoy some coffee while their littles run around. It's also VERY clean. My son is 18 months old & had a great time. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids when it's hot outside. Food is a bit expensive for the quality. Love being able to play with the kids and roam around through the tunnels. Bathrooms could be cleaner but they have tons of use! Love that they expanded!"}
{"text":"I come here often to do my homework while my kids play. I love that there are different play areas for kids all ages."}
{"text":"Such a great place to bring the kids. They have an area for the big kids and a toddler area. While here I ordered a turkey sandwich on a croissant and an Italian soda. The sandwich portion was just right.  My only complaint is they need to keep the toddler zone a toddler zone. My 15 month old was playing in the area and some kids way to big for that area kept pushing and kicking her. They really need to make sure the parents are watching their kids. I had to tell these kids to play nicely because the parents wouldn't. Some parents bring their kids here and pay no attention to them so beware. The entire time I was here I heard 5 kids crying because another child had hurt them. Make sure you avoid lunch time it can get super crowded and limited seating. They only have a few couches surrounding the play zone."}
{"text":"This place is really clean- really. I love that! Probably the cleanest play area I've ever been to. The playground is kept  up very nice. It is expensive and the coffee is terrible. Order from the espresso bar, it is tolerable, but you'll wait a while for your drink to come out ( I think we waited about 15 minutes for 2 Lattes). However, the food is good and the kids meals come with  plenty of food. The kids loved it. I will bring them again for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best indoor places I've found for kids (and parents). I haven't found any other place where I can bring my computer, have free wifi, and know my daughter (3 years old) is safe and having a great time. And a cafe with good coffee in the same place? Are you kidding me?  Free coffee refills. The owner is very friendly, staff is nice. Best of all the playground area is clean and very well made (padded surfaces, everything looks well maintained.)  I wish there was one of these in Denver, where we are from, but we plan on visiting Playgrounds every time we visit Phoenix in the future."}
{"text":"This place is alright for the most part except me getting food poisoning was the best part."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time last weekend, and we loved it! My daughter is 20 months and had a blast! Yes, there were older kids in the toddler area, but it is not the staff's responsibilty, it's the PARENTS! My daughter was even picked on, but as a PARENT I stayed close to  my kid and even told the little girl who was picking on her to be nice (since her own mother wasn't paying attention of course).   The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because of the weekend hours. I bet this place is great for stay at home moms to take the kids during the week, but as a working mom it sucks that it's only open till 2pm on the weekends."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  My kid is is almost 3 and he had a total blast.  I see some of the reviews about the older and youngs kids being in the same area and management should do something.  Personally..I disagree because it's not their kid.  If someone had a problem with my child (even though I keep an eagle eye on him) I would expect them to say something to me and not scare my kid, I just think that's the parent's responsibility.  I think this place is much easier and less expensive then the pizza places and he has just as much fun...and it totally wares him out.  The food was yummy, the place was clean, and I think the setup was awesome too.  Kudos to the owner...what a great idea!!!"}
{"text":"Brought my 2 granddaughters here when they were visiting from the east coast. They were 1 1/2 and 3 1/2. What a great hit!   The equipment is built so that the parents can go inside as well - a bonus when your little one is trying it for the first time. In addition to the climbing equipment, there are also ride on cars which the toddler loved.  The equipment is so creative that the kids were entertained for multiple trips during their visit here, and they still talk about wanting to go back on their next visit.  The staff is amazing at remembering your drink orders - they got mine right on the 2nd visit! And they bring your food and drink to you, so no need to do the \"starbucks dance\" while you wait (and wait) on the barista.  Their food is simple but creative and very fresh. My favorite is the breakfast panini. Haven't tried the muffins, as I'm  not a big muffin fan, but the cookies are awesome.  Did I mention super clean? Since it's brand new, everything is sparkling, but you can always see the staff cleaning and cleaning. The owner is very friendly and seems to always be on site, but his crew is very friendly and helpful as well. Just a nice place to hang out and let the kids enjoy."}
{"text":"My daughter is 2 and loves this place. It's clean. Yes it looks a little beat up (the vinyl on the stairs, some of the cars are missing steering wheels) but it gets the job done. My only wish was that some of the parents did a better job. I've had kids hurl giant foam blocks at my small daughter, shove her down and climb over her to get to a slide and kids run the little tyke cars full force into the emergency exit door. Yes it's a place for the kids to vent their energy but JESUS PEOPLE parent your kids. It would be nice if there was an attendant or someone maybe keeping an eye on these kids to enforce some standard of behavior. I don't really enjoy parenting other people's kids to ensure my kid isn't injured while playing. We can't eat at the cafe, my kiddo has a wheat allergy and there isn't a ton for her but the menu is large and I've been told it's good. I think it needs to be a little cheaper to get in as well."}
{"text":"My little guy loves this place. It's great, especially for the hot summer days here in Phoenix. They wipe it all down every night and have it steam cleaned every so often too. Just make sure you keep a close eye on your little because some parents just let their kids run wild. I know that the idea is for parents to relax and let their kids play...but there are little toddlers that will get pushed around by the older kids. I've often had to say something to other kids, nicely of course, \"be careful\" or \"hold on, let him/her get out of the way\".  Otherwise a great indoor play area for kids 5 and under. Plus their little pizzas and salads are good and they have lattes & fraps.   FYI I also would like to advise there is an uncovered outlet in the middle of the play area. Which I did advise two employees about it and didn't see it was covered the next time I went."}
{"text":"Great place for the kids to play. Very clean. Food is decent. Lots of seating for adults. We will definitely becoming back."}
{"text":"I just want to say that I love this place.  I don't have children but I attended a birthday party for my niece here and I was impress with this place.  It's a giant indoor playground.  There's an area for the children to take off their shoes and little cubbies to put them in.  I was very surprised that kids could entertain themselves for so long in the space of the playground.  There is a seating area for adults and there are magazines available to keep a parent's mind occupied.  There is also an adorable cafe that serve coffee, espresso drinks, sandwiches, and salads.  There are two little party rooms for private parties to eat and gather.  I was so impressed with this place that I turned to my brother and said, \"If this place had wifi, it would be the perfect place to bring your kids.  You could let them loose and just sit down and surf the web for a while.\"  It turns out that they do have wifi.  It has to be said that the employees of this establishment were very friendly and accommodating.  One of the kids at the party had a gluten allergy and they made him a gluten fee plate.  They were very cheerful and really helpful with any requests that my brother and his wife had.  They also were cleaning the disinfecting the play area throughout the time we were there but they did so in a non intrusive way.  They never closed down an area of the playground for the cleaning, they would just sneak in and wipe it down methodically while the kids played.    I really recommend this place if you have kids.  The entire facility is small enough for you to never lose sight of your child or the play area but it's also big enough to keep your kid entertained for hours.  It is also parent friendly.  I believe this is a new business.  Give it a try.  I think you'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"Really really great place for kids to play off their energy in a safe environment and parents,  grandparents or care takers can sip yummy coffee drinks, eat amazing bakery goods (pumpkin chocolate chip muffins our favorite) and/or have an amazing salad or sandwich..paninis too!  I am a grandmother and have one eye on the children,  the other on my newspaper or tablet...yes they have free Wi-Fi!  My grandchildren have alot of fun here...not happy when time to go.    The facility is really clean, great staff and most importantly,  the kids are actively playing."}
{"text":"My 21 month old loved it!  Didn't have their food.  I did see someone with a frappe of some time and it looked delicious.  I should've asked him how it was.  I would definitely bring my baby girl here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It is really clean and the food is really good with reasonable price. The two employees that I always see in the morning definitely know what they are doing and food always comes out fast. The best time to come is before 10 because it does get a little busy after that and unfortunately some parents don't watch their kids. Some kids don't behave and hit or push other kids and those parents do not care! The only reason I give them 4 stars is because I have been coming here for a while and I just noticed that the lady gave a punch card to someone. I was never given one not even for my coffee. I could have had one for free already. If you come here make sure to ask for one ."}
{"text":"Great customer service and place for young children to play. They were so accommodating and really appreciated there service."}
{"text":"Cute place, not too big but there is a nice sitting area for parents.  Also, the staff is really nice!  I would recommend it for anyone in the area with small (under 8 y.o.) kids looking for a few hours of peace.  The cafe is right there and there's just enough for the little ones to do that you can enjoy your coffee in peace, but not worry about where they are & what they're up to.  Very nice!"}
{"text":"Went here today! The food was great and the service was great! My kids had a awesome time as well! I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Great place to chill and play in AC and have ur kids play all day long. Food, fun and drinks for all plus room to study or work."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times so far and it's our new fav spot. I have a 2 year old and she has so much fun every time we go. Options for toddler activities are limited in Phoenix when temperatures reach and exceed 110 degrees. This place is clean, comfortable, safe & best of all indoors! I haven't tried their food yet but the menu has a good selection."}
{"text":"Our first time here. What a fun clean place to take the kiddos. We will definitely be back! One thing I wish they had was sturdy step stools for kids to use to better reach the sink for hand washing. Was very surprised to see a child centered business lacking these in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Owner is awesome and super nice, good food for a good price and the best part of all...... SO CLEAN. you would think after 7 days a week of kid using the equipment constantly you would think it would be dirty or worn out, they are good at replacing worn down toys and keeping it sanatized.  My son loves it here!!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place! The cookies and muffins are so good!! Fresh and taste wonderful. I wish I could say the same for the coffee. It's just nasty. I've had it on two different occasions, two different flavors and didn't care for it. The owner got a little offended when my friend told him the coffee wasn't great- but hey, he asked for her honest opinion. We will definitely be back because my daughter loves playing there and it's a great price to drain some of her energy. I'd get your coffee after at the Starbucks across the street though."}
{"text":"Toddler fist fights, pushing, shoving, yelling and parents just sitting doing nothing. What good are the rules if no one is enforcing them? This was my first visit and it was a stressful experience. I could not take my eyes off my kids for a second for fear of them getting hurt. I felt a lot of those kids/parents should have been asked to leave, instead I was forced to take my children out of there to just not deal with the chaos anymore. There was another women with her child leaving for the same reason. I also had to stop an unsupervised toddler trying to leave the play area. It's a shame because it is a really cute place and it is kept very clean. I hope the staff figures out a way to get control and make it a safer, less stressful situation for parents and children.  Response: I was there on Thursday October 15th in the am. Your staff did make some rounds and asked some kids to stop rough housing but the kids just continued when they walked away. The only thing your staff approached parents about and enforced was the sock rule."}
{"text":"Clean, fun and coffee! Kids play in all the fun zones and socks are required. Good snack food, like pretzels and corn dogs, latte was good and the kids have been playing for over an hour."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place.  They have a awesome atmosphere and friendly staff. My daughter had her 4th birthday party here and its was a amazing time for her and all her friends. Their food and coffee is a added ++."}
{"text":"We had tons of fun with our 19 month old! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I wanted to find a way to beat the heat with my two boys, ages 6 and 1. I decided to take them on a Saturday when they first opened so I could beat the crowd. The man at the counter was very kind and gave us the Sibling Discount ($2 off of the admission for my 1 year old). The facility was very clean and nicely decorated. I loved the set up! Comfy couches facing the play area, making it super easy to keep an eye on my kids while they played. The café food is very well priced and there is a very good selection to chose from. I ordered a very tasty croissant breakfast sandwich for only $4 and my 6-year-old had the French toast kids plate which came with fruit and milk (which my 1-year-old snacked on). Their coffee menu was super impressive and reasonably priced. The girl at the counter was very helpful in helping me choose a coffee that had a good a mount of caffeine but still tasted yummy. She suggested the Carmel Macchiato and I was not disappointed.    Both of my boys had a blast. I didn't leave feeling like I needed a beer due to the chaos and unpleasantness I usually experience at other outdated, crummy indoor play areas found throughout the valley. Awesome staff, great prices, yummy food and drinks, and no tantrums or boo-boos from my boys. It was a pleasant experience and this establishment will definitely have my business again."}
{"text":"Great for a hot day, a cold day, or a rainy day to keep kids entertained (in a safe environment) and get their energy out. The coffee shop is actually great too for moms, dads, grandparents, babysitters, etc. Took our nephews and they loved it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a business associate - the best Croissant chicken salad sandwich I've had in a long time...and I do make my own...sweet tasting and excellent!  Also had an iced latte  -  double ristretto shot of PRESS espresso (local roaster) ...great job. Loved it and my business associate was pleased as well...he had the Turkey sandwich...\"what was that ...\"  it was cranberry relish(?) with whipped cream on turkey...You need to try this...All in all a great meal, cafe was quiet enough to have a good conversation and the owner / host James Bernau has the energy and enthusiasm of a 11 year old boy and loves his job!  Great coffee & espresso Great lunch.  If your in the neighborhood, you need to get into Play Grounds Fun-zone Cafe."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 2 year old here after looking for somewhere for her to get some energy out that wasn't on the east side. The place was pretty busy which for a younger kid like our daughter can be intimidating. Parents were hanging out by the tables and couches. Our daughter really wanted to play with the little tikes cars but bigger kids were using them and were being pretty rough. Parents do not seem to watch their kids which is frustrating. The place was overall clean but I do not think we would go back until our daughter was a couple years older."}
{"text":"My daughter and I really enjoy this establishment! What made me choose this place over the others was the fact that they offer a discount for your first time. It gets emailed to you and you can print it out or just show it to them. They offer sibling discounts and, of course, parents are free. If you don't have socks or forget to bring some, you can borrow some from them so your kids can play. They have a nice, healthy selection of food for both adults and kids and absolutely amazing, homemade, chocolate chip cookies. The place is very clean and you can always catch an employee picking up or cleaning/sanitizing every 15-30 minutes. My daughter enjoys making new friends every time we go and never wants to leave.  All the staff are friendly and very accommodating and definitely want to make sure you and your kids are having a good time!"}
{"text":"Had fun at grand nephew's 1st birthday party"}
{"text":"We had my daughters 3rd birthday party here today and it was fantastic. The staff was great, on top of everything and made it completely stress free for me. They provided pizza from barro's and we had a huge salad with feta and cranberry in it, a little more upscale for the adults and everyone raved about it. Most importantly, my daughter had a blast and so did the other kids. Also, my own personal fave, I didn't have to clean up a thing. Priceless"}
{"text":"GREAT place to take the kids when it's too hot out to play.  Also, they have a decent \"bistro style\" menu.  It would be nice if they had more TV's showing sports, not everyone is a single mom...sometimes, dads take their  kids out too."}
{"text":"Finally we found an indoor play area! My 9 month old son enjoyed the \"toddler area\". He crawled around and climbed on the large soft blocks. I thought he might get bored quick because there wasn't actual toys but he didn't mind at all. Once I thought about it, I was glad there wasn't toys. More toys = more germs.   The only thing I had to be careful with was the bigger kids storming into the crawlers area. I know it's all fun and they don't mean any harm but I had to extra careful they didn't whack my kid.   I didn't have a chance to try the cafe but kudos for the option.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our 2.5 year old loves this place. It's an awesome place to get his energy out. Kids over 5-6 are probably too old for this place as they might get bored but it is an awesome option for the little ones. They also have a cafe where to can have breakfast or lunch with great options. Parents can enjoy a mocha and kids can have a fruit smoothie on a break. We love to come here and burn a few hours.   PS- check in on Yelp and get $2 off admission for kids 3 & under!"}
{"text":"It's a fun place but for my 18 month old to get in its 11 dollars! Seems pricey to me because he gets bored there after an hour! An attention span for an 18 month is short, 11 dollars is a lot to me! I also bought a medium latte and that was over 4 dollars. I will compare it to the children's museum it is the same price and its 3 floors! Probably better for older kids, because you could stay a few hours!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!! We are from CA and come to this area to visit family a few times a year. We always make sure to save time for this place. It is SO clean and my toddler loves it! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. They also make sure the bigger kids don't play too rough with the littles. Another plus is the adult lounge area with a yummy cafe!!! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent indoor playground for kids. Have been with my 2 year old numerous times since moving to Glendale and will continue to come frequently. Very clean, very friendly staff. Also have staff on floor during busier times to help corral the little ones. Speaking of which...it gets MOBBED during the summer obviously. Separate play area for infants only but they still have access to entire playground. Adventurous parents are allowed to play on equipment with the kids! Food is simple but tasty for a snack or a meal. Felt at first it was a bit pricey, but you can stay as long as you want and add a kid's meal for only $2 more. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Great place for little kids (infant - 5yrs).  Older kids seemed to get bored quickly.  The cafe is good too - the cobb salad is fresh and very good, milkshakes are delicious, and the coffee drinks are great.  Remember - socks, no shoes."}
{"text":"We love this place! The baby/toddler area and big kid area are perfect for my one and five year olds.  The food is surprisingly delicious, I love their breakfast wrap super healthy and delicious. My daughter loves the French toast sticks, and they are very reasonably priced. The staff is always very nice and they do a great job of keeping an eye on the kids area for safety. You can't beat sitting on couches drinking coffee while your kids play. What a fantastic idea, I only wish they had more of these!"}
{"text":"This place an awful, Lord of the Flies inspired nightmare!  To start off our experience right, they wouldn't honor the coupons we'd received from their email advertisement the night before, which was not a good sign.  We would have left at that point if we weren't meeting friends there.  They have special areas to keep the infants and toddlers safe, but the staff and absentee parents do nothing to enforce these rules, so you've got 8 year old children body slamming each other from piled up couch cushions and blindly hopping over walls where babies are crawling around.  Most of the parents are sitting far away from the action snaking on the bland, overpriced food/drinks they serve, letting their kids run wild and barefoot, climbing backwards up slides, climbing up and jumping off the sides of the equipment, kicking each other on the slides, tripping and knocking down random kids in their way, and yanking the push cars away from smaller children just so they can run the cars into other smaller children playing nearby.  If you're not into parenting your kids, then this is a great place to let them run around and terrorize others ... but if you love your kids, and you've tried to raise them right, and want to bring them home uninjured, then stay clear of the PlayGrounds \"Thunderdome\" Fun Zone in Glendale."}
{"text":"Went to Playgrounds again today. Had a great time. We had our sons 2nd birthday here and it was good.  When there today the staff were hard at work cleaning. Some of the fellow parents were telling me they fresh bake the pastries daily and the coffee is amazing. Humm will have to see."}
{"text":"indoor fun for the little ones,soft clean foam creatures to claim and slide down. Your normal mall playzone filled with kids to be kids,seating on the inside and around the outside has plugs to be able to charge mobile devices."}
{"text":"Great food made fresh (try cinnamon roll!), great coffee, fresh fruit fresh ingredients.  Kids play while you relax and eat and chat.  Staff is awesome and friendly, very informative.  Will come again.  Such a cool place."}
{"text":"Great place to let the kids run around while you sit and relax.  The play area is big enough to keep them entertained, yet small enough that they won't get lost in the crowd.  We were there for a 4th birthday party - perfect for this age.  I would love to see more locations because I'm sure this will get very crowded during the hot summer months."}
{"text":"I love this place. My only complaint is that in the 'little crawlers' area people don't regulate their children: it's meant for LITTLE crawlers and people let their older kids in there and they collect all the props and tower then up and throw them around like rabid raccoons. My 10 month old has been wacked a few times.. I put this on the parents of the children more though. Clean it up ppl!! Otherwise, it's a fun place to meet a friend and let the kids learn and play while sipping lattes!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! So many times I've had to travel with my toddler son who is three years old and have had to work and this was a great distraction for him while mommy sat working studiously on the side. Also very secure and the seating area makes it rather comforting watching your kids and knowing no one can walk off with them. Great coffee too!!"}
{"text":"The food selection is really good here and the portions are a lot larger than you would think. My daughter enjoys playing here, she is 15 months. We started coming when she was a crawler and she really enjoyed the large plush toys in that section. The only complaint I have is the older children always in the smaller aged areas. Makes it hard for my kid to play in the toddler section when a 5 year old is shoving her through the tunnel. I just wish they were more strict on that issue other than that I am still a fan."}
{"text":"Came here looking for something to do for my rambunctious 17 month old! Not from around here and just visiting, so found this place on Yelp! So happy we did. It provided just the entertainment we needed for the morning part of our day. Very spacious, lots of sitting space for parents and bystanders. Toddler section was big enough to accommodate our little one's flighty interests for over an hour. We got breakfast as well and the food was delicious. I would recommend to others and would return again!"}
{"text":"I have been bringing my girls here for a while. They love it. The employees are amazing. Everyone is so nice. One of the employees (Lisa) there stands out like crazy. I think she is a manager or something. She is full of energy and always interacts with my girls.  You can just tell she is fit for the job :) Just a true bundle of joy hahaha one of the reasons I keep going back :)  We had taken some time off as one of my girls was in the hospital for a little bit and then recovery at home. So I figured I would take the girls back here as they needed to get out of the house. When I went back there was a lot of new employees. Which is cool,I understand they may needed to hire more people as the business grows. But there is something just different about the place now. Doesn't feel as \"hype\" as it did. The energy is down. I did notice one of the new, managers I think, was told her name is Jenny. Not sure how she got a job here. she just very blah for the environment. Idk if that's why the energy is down there or what but she kinda just has that face of \"I'm better than you\" look on. As a whole the place is awesome though. Just needs more energy. I need more Lisa vibe!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved it ... my son is only 8 mos and he loves older kids ... and I am try to break him in so when he go to daycare he will be okay... a little small but nice place. Food takes to long when ordering...and it was over priced."}
{"text":"PlayGrounds was our \"go-to\" place to be on a hot Phoenix day (or a random day off school!). They have a variety of areas for kids, including an area for the smaller kids. I love that I can climb and interact with my kids as well while they play. Then, I can sit back with their excellent selection of coffee and use their free wi-fi while I do catch up on some work. They also have child-friendly food options (could maybe use more on the allergy-frinedly list but we don't have that issue), as well as clean bathrooms and an overall fun experience for kids."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place... So much cleaner than outdoor parks, good food and a fraction of the low-class inattentive parents I usually encounter at the mall playground. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing! Love this little hidden gem on the west side. I will be returning quite a bit, we loved it here. Place was clean, safe and food was great. The people who are complaining about bullies here by other kids, let me suggest the parents get off their phones and actually watch their kids. That is not the businesses issue, ppl should not be leaving negative reviews because parents don't care to actually parent their kids by keeping an eye on them. Visit this place, especially during the summer, you will be so happy to burn a few hours and have some tired out, happy kids."}
{"text":"My daughter could spend all day here. She was in heaven! This is an amazing play place. It allows young children the freedom to explore and play without parents having to climb the structures with them. But that's not to say you don't have to watch your child.   They have a toddler zone for the smaller ones and then a huge enclosed jungle gym with slides galore. My daughter had the biggest smile on her face he entire time.   And the best part? They have a cafe attached to the play zone that has really good food and coffee! You never get both a fun play place for kids and good food for the adults but this is it!   I came from North Scottsdale and it wasn't a far drive. Just about 15 minutes on the freeway.   If you have a child, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Nice indoor play place for kids 10 and under. Their coffees are pretty good - wish they had more options for food. Other than that, great place"}
{"text":"I like this place, but there's a very small area for many children to play in. There are plenty of benches which is good, but it provides limited space for children to play. I have a 4 and 3 year old and they get trampled over. Many parents do not watch their kids and it ends in many kids getting bullied or hurt. The hours are very constricting as well. By the time I get off work, they're closed."}
{"text":"Too pricy!! I took my 2 year old and it surprised  me that they charge 11 dollars for her to play, despite the fact that we ate there. Food was overpriced and did not taste good, staff was not friendly. Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Run down. Tears and cracks in the vinyl coverings.  Two bathrooms but one is out of order. The operating bathroom had an overflowing diaper trash can and the stench was overpowering. Kids are wearing socks and floor was soaking wet.  Employees who do nothing but stand behind the coffee shop counter out of sight of the playground.   The website states that the playground is sanitized every day. It is evident that cleaning is not included in their efforts. Food, funk and dust bunnies abound under and around the play equipment.  The experience on the whole would improve if electronic devices were banned. 90% of the parents paid little if no attention to their child(ren). When your 10 year old is riding on top of a Cozy Coup you really need to look up from IPhone."}
{"text":"Needless to say, it didn't matter, as she never offered us the chance to order anything before rushing back to her ongoing conversation. Even worse than being essentially refused service & being forced to navigate through the screaming chaos on our own, the horribly rude woman that I wanted to punch in the face because she couldn't be bothered with us nor give us the quickest of explanations of the operation in order for us to fully enjoy ourselves, like, say, how does one order food if she wasn't going to help us, which, BTW, is exactly why I bring our own yummy stuff everywhere, but the absolute worse part was that she ended up being the most polite person there in comparison to the overly judging parents & their monstrous bully brats that I had to keep protecting princess from. Of course, with such a classless operator \"running\" things, what did I expect?   Needless to say, I'll be going to the far cleaner, better organized & by far, more welcoming McDonald's playground from now on, for at least another year or so. Maybe I'll check back in down the road, when Cassie can truly fend for herself & hopefully this place will be under new management by then..."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's definitely the perfect play area for my son who just turned 2. It's my second time coming and both times has been a great experience. I love that they have couches to relax on. It is very comfortable, clean and the staff are very nice.  It's a bit small but it works for me and my toddler because sometimes big places are to much and I was able to enjoy myself while keeping my eyes on him.    The cafe is also a plus for me. But You are able to bring your own food/snacks as well. They also have free wifi!!!!!!!  I will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Wow! My niece and I had a wonderful time here today. We were welcome and even told about the meal and play combo that cost for her about $11.00.  I jumped, crawled, and slid right along side her. We had a healthy lunch of ham and cheese with fruit  with apple juice and I got the Beef and pepper Panini with chips not only were the meals awesome they came with a cookie. Who could ask for more? But it doesn't stop there... No... There was couches for me to relax on after hour two of playtime and it gave me to a chance to energy refuel with a nice mocha latte.   Keep in mind not all of those are there to play with their kid and unfortunately some are a little bit rough when playing. Advice don't go unless your going to play along or be close to their side. It was great fun and we spent a good 4 hours there. DON'T FORGET YOUR SOCKS! :P"}
{"text":"My 20 month old son goes wild for this place. The menu is pretty good for adults and kids. The play area is perfect for our son's age group."}
{"text":"My 19 month old daughter and I went there with a friend and her 2 year old son today. We went pretty early in the morning.  The kids had good fun at first but as it started getting busier they kept being run over and knocked down by some of the bigger kids.  2 kids in particular.  We both noticed that said kid's mom/grandma/guardian were too busy on their computers to pay any attention to what their kids were doing and how they were behaving.    My friend's little boy was knocked down so hard that she could hear his head hit the floor bounce and hit again. She rushed out of there to take him to the emergency room to see if he had a concussion.  My daughter and I left then too.    I feel like a few of those mothers just use this place as extremely cheap daycare so they can do their work or school work on the computer and just let their kids run amok.  I think laptops should not be allowed unless there are 2 adults present with the child so that someone is there to supervise.   We all pay to be there and are not getting paid to babysit someone else's kid."}
{"text":"Always a fun place to take the kids! Indoor playground for small children with a cafe attached to grab a quick smoothie or a full lunch."}
{"text":"First visit- I LOVE the concept!!!! My daughter and her friend both 2 years old had a ton of fun here!!! I honestly dont think this is a place for children ages 6+. Observing the place, I do think there should be better security measures to ensure that the right kids are going home with the right adult. I didn't feel it a threat while I was there but it would just make me feel better overall, obviously it hasn't been an issue though. And I can't really say I saw many employees ensuring that kids weren't being too rough or parents weren't too preoccupied. I'd definitely like to see more employee involvement.  On another note, the place is hidden. I frequent the area and had nooooo idea it was there!!! I only went because my daughter got a gift card to the place for her birthday!   We went on a Friday morning, it was comfortable there are plenty of tables and couches and it wasn't too crowded.  Lastly, I think when you have kids there on a daily basis toys and everything should be updated & extremely clean! The little cars they have looked old and used way too many times along with some little chairs/couches they had for kids.  I would definitely recommend and I'd definitely be back. Probably not on a weekend, I don't want to know how crazy it could be."}
{"text":"A lot of these lower reviews are for parents not watching their children. Keep in mind you are reviewing the facility not the people who come here.  My son and I come here whenever we are visiting with my parents. It continues to be an absolutely fun day. We have tried the food and drinks and they are all good and reasonably priced. Everything is clean and well maintained. We can't wait to come back this summer when it's 120 degrees outside!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place. The kids love it, but wind up sick every time after a visit. Food is pretty good. Today I was not allowed to eat or drink while I sat on the right side of the couch; however the lady on left side of the couch had milks, food, coffee etc. When I asked why she was allowed, but not me, I was told she had been served by someone else. ??? Seems a bit discriminatory to me."}
{"text":"Great space. Really clean in a good area. Great food. Very friendly staff. It's a gem. Definitely recommend it. Fresh tasty sandwiches. Great for kids and adults."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! I love that there is a place I can take my 2 and 4 year old to play that is indoors, cool and CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN!!!  The fact that there is free water or food and drink to purchase just makes it that much better.  I have been to several indoor playgrounds and they're usually filthy, chaotic, nightmares with bad food and pre-teens knocking my kids down.  Playgrounds Fun Zone & Cafe is the opposite of that.  It's more like a cozy home that your kids can run free in.  We think it is amazing!  We have been here 4-5 times and each time the coffee and food is consistently great and my children have a blast.  There are play areas for different age groups, which we love.  Our experience has been that there are kids of all ages (crawling baby to 9-10ish years old) running all over the place having fun.  We have had so many positive experiences here, that any negatives are pretty much irrelevant to us (i.e. kids bumping into each other, kids taking cars away from others, etc.).  The older kids we have encountered have always been sweet and helpful to our kids.  Their peers are usually just stumbling their way through learning public social skills like the rest of us.  Since we are helicopter parents, we are right there noticing these interactions, which usually cracks us up more than upsets us.  For the most part, all of the kids are just trying to have fun and don't mean any harm.  I won't give a full review of the foods we have tried, the drinks, the bathrooms, the staff, etc. as I believe the majority of reviews on here are right on as far as pros and cons.  Generally, we love the food, the coffees and the staff have always been nice and helpful to us.  Only suggestion I would make is to have some sort of child checking system (stamps or stickers) to keep the right kids with the right adults upon leaving.  Other complaints I saw were about prices and the fact that parents have their faces in their phones/books/computers.  As far as pricing goes, I'm glad to pay a higher price to have a quality place to take my kids...the owners clearly use the money to benefit their customers.  As for the parents who are on their phones...give them a break....seriously....the energy of children is never ending....going to Playgrounds may be the only \"break\" they get all day. Let's try to be supportive of our fellow parents instead of always judging each other. :)  But back to the review, we tell all of our friends about Playgrounds and we go about twice a month since finding it. We will continue to go as long as it consistently stays a safe, fun, clean place for both us and our children....and I believe it will!  Keep up the great work! :)"}
{"text":"My 22 month old and I really enjoyed our time at Playgrounds.  I felt like I got a good value for the cost.  My only criticism would be that the play area seems a little small compared to the full size of the location.  Nonetheless, this is a great place to get out of the heat with a toddler."}
{"text":"We had my daughter's 2 year old birthday party at Playground FunZone. They provided pizza as part of the cost as well as colored table clothes and balloons. You can pick the color of balloons and table cloth but I highly recommend bringing your own plates/napkins to add to your theme because they only do one color plates, utensil, and napkins (cups are clear, plates white or black, and plain napkins). They do allow you to bring in your own napkins/plates/cups and were very accommodating in allowing us to set up different banners and even a sign-in up front even though we had a \"public\" party. They also allowed us to bring in our own dessert. They provide a couple employees to help \"host\" the party and they will serve food and help clean up making it easy to enjoy the time with your guests.   My daughter loves Playgrounds. On other days when we come to just play she enjoys ordering lunch there as well. While their food is pretty good, it often takes a while to get to you so I HIGHLY suggest ordering before your kiddo is hungry if you don't want a hangry toddler on your hands.  Last tip! Don't forget your socks, they require socks for both children and adults!"}
{"text":"Took my 10-month-old to this place today paid eight dollars and went to the crawler area only to find 10 toddlers running around throwing things. My daughter got hit several times and we left after about 10 minutes I don't understand why there's a crawler area if you're going to allow toddlers to be in that area also there was really nothing engaging for my daughter to play with she kind of just sat there. It was probably because she was overwhelmed with all the toddlers running around her. We won't be back I'm going to find another place that is better with managing multiple aged kids."}
{"text":"We have been here about five times. We travel from the east valley and make about a 50 minute drive but it is worth every mile. My kids are 3 and 6 and prefer this place over any other indoor playground or play place we have been to. We had two small birthday gatherings for our kids a week a part and James went out of his way to make it special even on short notice. I even had reservations at another place but my 6 year old begged for us to come to PlayGrounds instead. James once again helped us out.   The owner is more than accommodating and very generous with prices. The food is delicious and when my kids finish their plate I call it a job well done. you can tell they use quality food.  My in-laws and I all purchased the granola that they make themselves and it is SO good! I don't often write reviews but I feel like this place warrants one right away.  Bottom line: Customer service is great, facility is clean, food is worth ordering, and we could be there for hours and the kids don't get bored. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place before, but a friends child needed to let off some energy. If you check in on Yelp, they offer a discount for kids under 3. Parents are no charge.   I tried the food, I had a cranberry turkey wrap, it took a while to receive, and it's a little pricey, but I thought it tasted good.   I ate and watched kids, mostly under the age of 5, run around and play. I think you could do a whole psychological study on the kids here. Some kids have no sense of sharing or consideration for people around them. Some kids seemed to be on the path to bullying, making you wonder about nature versus nurture.   Anyway, the indoor playground concept is a great idea for hot climates. I do think there should be a check system to ensure the right kid goes home with the right person though.   The play structure was large, but throw in a few more older kids or more kids in general - there were about 15 kids running around and overall it seemed like a lazy afternoon - and I'm sure things get crazy fast. The place was very clean, be sure to remember socks if you want to play.   Workers were present, but not really felt or noticed. I say this is a good place in the dead of summer with bored kids, just be sure to watch them."}
{"text":"I have come back several times since my original review and I give this establishment kudos. My last review recommended outlet covers in their toddler/crawler area and not only did they do that, they added padding on the walls. I'm impressed.  My daughter still has a blast and is now getting brave climbing in the the other areas. I've also ordered food and coffee here and it definitely isn't bad and reasonably priced. I highly recommend coming to beat the heat and have fun with the little ones."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take my daughter over here for a try out last Sunday. It usually costs $11 (adults don't pay, which is great because many of these other places make the adults pay a fee to enter and basically watch their kids and it ends up being very expensive for a family to afford something like that) but we got a deal for $6 because it was the first time we were taking her there.  The place itself is clean and nice. When you first open the door you can see the little cafe area where they have coffee and some pastries. They have a nice menu which includes sandwiches, salads and kids meals, too.   There are two bathrooms and they were both well maintained and clean. Kids must wear socks at all times and adults also (if you're gonna be interacting with your kid in the play area). If you don't have socks, you can also rent a pair for $1.   There are some sofas in front of the play area and some tables and chairs for the adults to sit and watch their kids or eat their food. They don't allow food or drinks from outside though.  Overall it's a nice place and we'll be bringing our daughter back. There were lots of kids this past Sunday and apparently they also celebrate birthday parties because there was one Spiderman themed party while we were there too. The staff decorated the tables for the little guests and they brought Barro's pizza. I don't know if the pizza's included on the birthday celebration package or what the deal is but the kids seemed to be having a good time.  Check it out! Your kids can climb and run around for a few hours while you just sit and relax. Not a bad deal at all!!"}
{"text":"I like this place for my kids, but it gets crowded pretty fast, especially during the summer. The place is kept clean and the cafe is a bonus. My only complaint would be other parents who sit at the cafe and don't watch their children. Their children are climbing up the slides causing disruption."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience for us. It was clean and spacious. WiFi was good and not slow. The snacks we ordered we good and decently priced. The employees were accommodating every time we interacted. There is a few areas that are not roped off properly but they were not unsafe. The kids had a blast! In all minus some of the other families we shared the space with we enjoyed our visit!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place serving coffee and a light menu offering inside an indoor play area for kids. Sounds great right? It was!  Came in on a Friday morning and this place was packed! First thing we noticed was that it was clean. Sometimes these play places have a certain \"lingering aroma\" to them, but nothing of the sort here. All of the play surfaces were clean and in good working order. A good amount of little tikes vehicles and enough climbing surfaces, slides and play areas to keep even the most energetic little one busy for a few hours.  Their coffee bar offers a full assortment of the usual drinks. My wife loved her iced vanilla latte and they also also have a small pastry case and a selection of breakfast and lunch sandwiches.   The only drawback is to be aware if you have little ones. There were some much older kids (our daughter is 22 months) and they can be a little overwhelming for the smaller children. There is an off shoot section for toddlers only, but there's not as much to it.   All in all after our first visit, we plan on getting one of their punch cards to come back soon, hopefully when it's not as busy!"}
{"text":"I love this place and my kids do too!! The pricing is very reasonable and they just implemented a reward program for regulars. It is always clean. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. The staff is super friendly and helpful.  The play area is quite large. There are also smaller sections for infants and toddlers. Around and under the play area is a carpeted space with little push cars for the kids to ride in. There is usually a monitor keeping an eye on the kids. Socks are required.   There are multiple tables, chairs, and comfy couches around for parents to sit at all offering clear views of the kiddos playing. Wifi is free. The coffee drinks are great and well priced. This is a great place to catch up on paperwork while the kids get some energy out! Good times had by all!!"}
{"text":"I took my 15mth old son for the first time a couple weeks ago. What a great place to be able to let your kids play and not be out in the heat, very clean, lots to do to keep the kids entertained. The only gripe I have is with some of the kids parents not watching their kids especially the older ones running around knocking down the toddlers but apart from that very clean, good food and friendly staff excited to have somewhere to take my little guys to burn off some energy..."}
{"text":"This place has great concept, but very poorly executed.   I took my 16 month old around noon on Wednesday. I had to wait about 5 minutes to be checked in. I saw that there are 3 areas designated for 3 age groups, but was not enforced by staff or parents, so bigger kids are running all over the place. Couple of the boys were throwing the cushions around for good 10 minutes before a male staff came to stop them. Unfortunately kids weren't listening to him because the staff that came over seemed to be autistic and couldn't tell kids to stop. There were 2 other staff but they never left the cafe area. Most of the time they were in the back area.   I went up to order some food for my son, one female staff was helping other guest, so I waited. When it was my turn, she said \"I'll be right back. I just need to check them in real quick\" Well, the people kept coming in, so she never came back to take my order. I didn't want to leave my son alone for too long, so I gave up on getting food.   There were LOTS of parents sitting around either on their phone or talking to their friends and not paying attention. I tried my best to stop any bigger kids from pushing my son over. I think my son had fun, but it was pretty stressful for me. I saw one kid bite other kid in the crawler area. Like draw blood, bite.   The faculty itself is in good shape for what it is. Little beat up, but that's the nature of business.   Overall,    4 star for facility 2 star for service 1 star for other patents and kids Can't rate the food, since I couldn't order.   It would be much better if there were more staff to cover each station."}
{"text":"Awesome place to bring my son. He's two and had a blast. We'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"James, the owner, has hit a home run with this place.  Great food and coffee. The chicken salad is amazing!   A place where kids can play inside and parents can play or watch from the cozy couches.  Staff is friendly.  One suggestion...if you do come here always keep an eye on your kiddos, don't zone out and ignore them. I have been here many times where my little peeps have fallen victim to others kids naughty behavior and mom is chatting away and doesn't notice.  Now if only James had a clone to open ore locations!"}
{"text":"Always a great time to be had here. The place is always super clean. The owner is super nice and great to work with. I am sadly thinking my daughter who is almost 5 is almost done with visiting this place but it was fun while it lasted!"}
{"text":"Great for young kids under 5 yrs old. Took my two littles (3 & 1.5) and they enjoyed. Can get busy and not enough tables to really seat everyone. Understaffed between 10am-12pm as it  was very busy and people were waiting for food and to be checked in. They keep the place very clean though. Prices are decent , cost us $19 with tax for two kids"}
{"text":"Today was the first time my 2 1/2 year old son and I visited the indoor playground/cafe , and were happy we did!  We normally venture over to the east side of town on the weekend when my little guy needs to do what 2 year olds do best, be WILD!  This place was a few dollars more $10, but much closer to home.  Overall the place was very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, but most important of all...Collin had ton of fun!  If he had to vote for one thing specifically, he would pick the slides.  My only lacking is that I noticed a few kids a bit older and rougher then the average.  If you keep an eye on your tot this shouldn't be an issue.  We certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"Playgrounds Fun Zone & Cafe is like a super-sized McDonald's Play Place, but with a cleaner play area, better food and a cover charge for the kids.  I hate to admit it now, but my first impression when I walked through the door was not very enthusiastic. The space is a pretty good size but the play area looked small, other than a few Cozy Coupes and some things for babies, there were no toys or non-climbing activities, and there weren't too may kids at 9:30 in the morning. I figured my 3-year-old would go through once or twice and get sick of it. That would be a great waste of the time it took to drive here and money. More than 3 hours later, she proved me wrong. My daughter enjoyed climbing through the tunnels and going down the slides. Plenty of families soon filled up the place. My daughter made some friends and had an incredible time. I even went through with her a couple of times. It was fun, but a little tough on this grownup's knees. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to find a seat, relax, and watch the kids play.  Playgrounds is right off the 101 and Union Hills Dr. that makes it a pretty easy drive for people who don't live that close. And when you go, don't forget socks for yourself and the little ones."}
{"text":"2 yr old loves it but gets trampled on by the big kids.. $11 for one kid and the place is small like McDonald's playground small so we don't go often especially how packed it gets. Overall nice and clean."}
{"text":"Love how we can order healthy foods and watch our kids play.  Very well kept and the owner is very nice and considerate.  Will definitely be a regular for a family outing."}
{"text":"Super cute place. My one year old LOVES coming here. They have three sections, one for babies, toddlers and bigger kids. My daughter loves the toddler area but will venture into the big kid area with my help. My advice for visiting wear gym clothes and WATCH YOUR KIDS. I have never had a bad experience here but that is because i'm with my daughter the entire time. I often observe parents of little kids talking or working on their computer while their minis cause chaos (hitting, shoving, screaming, stealing food or shoes) The staff is not responsible and they do not attempt to intervene in bad behavior. Its a really fun place with great food just be prepared."}
{"text":"I love having a place that I can take my son during these hot summer days! This place is so clean and love that it doesn't smell like smelly socks like some other indoor places. The cafe has LOTS of yummy treats! Definitely becoming part of our weekly rotation!"}
{"text":"I like this place but the area is not great. I mean parents have like 10 kids so they can only watch so many of them at one time and there's always a couple of bad seeds. So my kid got hit a couple times and this is probably the reason I won't be back. Watch your kids stop looking at your phones. This isnt necessarily The company's fault."}
{"text":"This wonderful place has only been open for about 3 months, but the word has gotten out. It can get pretty crowded during the early day, but even when it's almost full it's not terrible! The play area is wonderful. Set up with a toddler area and an older kid area. It's always clean and I see the staff cleaning all the time. The food is good and reasonable, kids meals are only $4.00 for a sandwich, milk, fruit, and cookie.  They have free wi-fi and it's fast. The owner is always here and cares about his business, all the employees are nice and friendly. The only thing is its a bit slow for the food, but that's fine, you can sit back and the kids can play while you wait."}
{"text":"My 21 month old had a blast! There is a toddler only area as well as other areas for bigger kids that toddlers can also go to. There are also little cars that all the kids loved to get in. I like that it's not super expensive to bring your kid in as well. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect as pictures are not always the best to go off. I took my toddler and though she had fun she only lasted an hour playing.  I really thought this place was going to be larger as the prices were a pinch high. 11$ for a toddler to play. Most won't even last that long playing.  I got in for happy hour and it was $6 plus tax. Not bad price but I would think that would be a everyday price for this age group as the playing area for a baby isn't large at all not with much to access and there are only 3-4 ride on cars that's kids were using.  Nice to have a meal and watch the kiddos so yeah I will come back only on happy hour and when she can play a bit longer. Yes true larger kids were playing and kind of being wild in the baby portion so you wouldn't wanna have your baby in there at all times. Kids will be kids and everyone was enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"We visited Playgrounds for the first time today, one thing I can say IMPRESSED! It was great. My son had a blast while mom and dad had a (tasty) bite to eat. Clean, friendly atmosphere. Several times I saw various staff cleaning.  We were kind of looking for a place to have my sons birthday...I think we have found it!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful alternative to McDonald's. My child has a TON of energy and in the AZ heat this is a great way for him to play. They have sugar free choices for coffee which made my day. The food was good...no complaints here. My only comment is I hope they stay and eventually expand."}
{"text":"Love taking my 1 year old here! Its reasonable and clean and good food! The owner is always friendly and so is rest of he staff! No complaints really other than I wish they had a changing table in both bathrooms. But not that big of deal. Sometimes annoying when other parents let big kids take over baby area but most parents are pretty good about watching their kids. We will continue to come here every week and sometimes twice a week!"}
{"text":"This is not worth the money. This place was TINY. I could have gone to mcdonalds or chick fil a playground for free! I didn't feel like my child was safe if I took my eyes off her. Anyone could just take my child and leave. There is no wrist bands or anyway knowing that person is leaving with their child. I definitely will not be back. I'd rathe pay the extra couple bucks and go to luv 2 play."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Playgrounds my kids and I loved it. Great place for the little ones to run out their energy and beat the hot AZ heat. We ate breakfast at their cafe and it was good too. The facility was very clean and well maintained. The also had a staff member monitoring the play area which I really liked. Comfy couches for parents to relax on or tables to sit at and eat or catch up on work. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"My first time in and the customer service was terrible.The Southwest breakfast sandwich on the digital menu on the wall said it was $4. When I was paying, I was charged $5. I informed the cashier it said $4 on the board and the cashier said \"well it might say that but it is $5.\" She would not change the price. Then my son wanted to play the claw machine in there. It took my money but the claw didn't even drop down and just ended the turn. I again told the cashier and she said \"well I don't know what to tell you, we have had someone out several times to fix it since it keeps having problems and had the claw replaced 5 times but it just doesn't work.\" I said they shouldn't have it on if that's the case knowing that it doesn't work but still taking people's money. She did not seem to care and just went on doing something else. These were my first experiences at this place and left me not even wanting to eat the food that I ordered. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"In Arizona we experience some extremely HOTT summers. This is a great place for children to run and play in a comfortable cool environment. The coffee and snack bar is great! Love the muffins and FREE Wifi. There is no one supervising the children only parents. The down fall is they close early on the weekends. I don't see why you would close early on the weekends or offer later times for birthday parties. Took my son here and my nephews and nieces they all love it. I love it! Imagination is great and keeps them from being on electronics. Also, I would recommend maybe some theme days and events? Maybe offer once a month FREE admission for all kids dressed as super hero's or something? Tea parties for the kids?"}
{"text":"We come here a LOT in summer. Too hot for the little ones at the park and need a place for them to have fun, burn energy and ensure I...I mean THEY take a good nap in the afternoon.   I love that there are couches, a cafe for much needed caffeine and it's clean.  I get the 5 visits for $35 deal since we're here a lot.  Breakfast is decent too!"}
{"text":"In Arizona there should more places that offer indoor playing options. It's nice to have a local place to take the kids on a hot day to play. I have been here several times and never purchased a drink because I'm weary of coffee from places that don't strictly sell coffee. The last time we were here I decided to give it a go and try the white mocha. It was surprisingly really good! Overall this place is great. It's only downfall is how busy it gets. There should really be a limit to how many children they allow in there at one time, and if they do already it's too high. A few times it's been so packed that my daughter couldn't really play. So now to avoid over crowding we only come here right when they open."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best indoor play area that I've found for my kids! The entire concept was well thought out and incorporated. The first thing I love about this place is that adults are free. Most places charge for adults and I end up feeling jipped since I'm not the one playing.   The second thing I love is the cafe. It's directly in front of the jungle gym, so you can easily enjoy your lunch and still keep an eye on your kids. They even keep a package of baby wipes at the counter for any sticky fingers! And the food was good and very reasonably priced.  The bathrooms are super clean and they have an actual wooden changing table, not one of those plastic ones that comes from the wall.   The entire staff was wonderful but I especially want to shout out Jessica for being extremely friendly and attentive to not only me, but everyone there. And also the older gentleman at the front counter (I didn't get his name unfortunately).   Amazing place! I wish they had one of these in the east valley because I would go very often."}
{"text":"We just had my daughters birthday party here and it was fantastic. The staff was great and the kids had more fun than I could have imagined. I can see us coming more often and for future birthday parties."}
{"text":"Great place for kids 2-7, very clean, friendly staff, and very comfortable for parents. A great place to sit back and have something to eat or drink and watch the kids play."}
{"text":"Great place for under 7. They advertise older but older kids would be bored with the climbing nets and set. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food at the café is enough to keep parents budgets and kids tummies happy. I am very glad I take my kids here for their fun activities."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its the only one in the west valley that we've found that actually has a play ground area and not just a bunch of tikes slides from BabiesRUs. Staff is friendly and the cafe is a huge plus and it's always been clean when we visit! It does get busy so get there early."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area. This is a good place for kids and good for parents too. Comfortable seating. Only tried the food once, it was okay -- a bit on the plain side and my suggestion for the kids' meals is to make the fruit portion larger, at least double.  Good architecture on the playground -- places to hide and enough variation to keep kids interested for an hour or two. Call ahead to check on the crowd, particularly to avoid a large group/birthday party which can make the joint hectic."}
{"text":"Cool place, but really for kids ages 3-5 I would say. Younger than that is kind of a waste of money. I wish people would control some of their ADD-ish kids though. So many loud ridiculous kids who should know how to act if they heard the word no sometimes."}
{"text":"I had a small birthday get-together for my son's 5th birthday and this place was a big hit with the children and adults.  The actual play area was smaller than expected but it was still loads of fun.  You had your little area for babies, another little area for small toddlers, and a bigger area for the older children.  There were also several little cars that children can get into and run around in.  We all ordered food at the cafe and we enjoyed it.  The menu consisted of mostly sandwiches and salads along with a variety of beverage and I felt it was all reasonably priced.  There is an area off to the sides where there are tables and couches where the adults can chill out in.  The staff we encountered were very friendly and I never felt like there was any issues.  Reading the negative reviews that complain about the other children being monsters and bullies I can't help but laugh.  Like, how is it this place's fault that the little monster children are so rough?  This is where responsible adults need to step in to diffuse the situation and it will sometimes be the PARENTS that need to do this.  Being a helicopter parent won't do your prince or princess any favors (there are many studies that prove this to have a negative effect on children).  Anyhoo, I love this place and am so happy with our time there.  I would love to come back again with my kids!  Tips: Check out their website for discounts on admission.  I did this and was able to save a significant amount of money.  Wear socks or bring socks to wear when you get here (both children and adults).  This is for sanitary reasons while playing in the play area.  You can purchase socks for a nominal fee when you check in if you would like."}
{"text":"Nice place! Small for the price but comfy for parents and decent to watch/monitor kiddos..  they have happy hour after 2pm so I'll definitely utilize that time every time because I don't think it's worth $11 per child. (Especially since I have 3 lol)"}
{"text":"Cute and clean, I think it's a little pricey just to play but my daughter enjoys her time when we go. All of the employees are very nice as well."}
{"text":"My son love this place! It's very well kept and always clean. The employees are always kind. A little expensive for the amount of equipment there is but its worth it for the cleanliness alone! We recommend it!"}
{"text":"My 2-year-old really enjoys it here. When it's busy it can get a little chaotic and there's no one really monitoring the kids on the floor, but if we go during slower times it's a lot of fun. I also appreciate that they have nice seating available for the adults."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place with my 1 year old daughter. I thought the price was fair, nice and clean play area, food looked really good. The biggest issues was there were older kids running wild, throwing mats in the \"crawler\" area. It's uncomfortable parenting other people's kids when staff should take on that responsibility or better yet the parents. I left because I was a little concerned for my daughters safety. I'm not sure if I'll be back unless the areas are monitored better."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! It is always very clean! Most of the time the kids are well behaved and parents are responsible! It is usually a good mix of kids having a good time!!   They have a HUGE variety of drinks, breakfast and lunch choices, many are very healthy choices!! They have a mini pizza for about $5.00 that is actually quite tasty! It is NOT a frozen crap pizza!   There is a lot of comfortable seating, whether you pick a picnic table, a couch, a loveseat, or  table and chairs at the cafe. We hung out for over three hours today. My kid had a blast and I was nice and relaxed!!   The owner is on site almost daily and is very proud of his business! I think he should be proud!! Thanks for bringing this venue to our neighborhood!! See you soon!!  TIPS:    Don't forget to take socks!!   If you have an older kid PLEASE keep them OUT of the toddler area!!"}
{"text":"My 2 toddlers LOVE this place. They always have a great time on the PreSchool sized playground. I love it because it is always clean and the owner and staff are extremely friendly and courteous. We recently had my son's 3rd birthday party there. The food was fresh and tasty, the service was great and every child there had a great time!  I recommend this place to anyone with toddlers and preschoolers."}
{"text":"Really great place for parents and kids. Can study or do work and keep half an eye on your little one. Lots of rooms and different level areas, my son loves the cars. Staff are really friendly. They have a breakfast and lunch menu, so if you're up for a sandwich, wrap or salad go for it! Also have a kids menu section with some basic kid loving foods. We had their lattes and they were excellent and a decent price."}
{"text":"So sad because this is an awesome, clean facility.  We had to leave when some other kids weren't asked to leave after biting my 2 year old daughter.   I'm surprised they don't have a zero tolerance for violence.  It's a kids playland for heavens sake!!!  The manager said that if she got bit a second time, THEN they'd ask the offender to leave.  Yeah, not gonna happen!   Apparently a little bit of violence is ok here... As long as it's a little bit.  Jaws was allowed to stay and play so we left  (no refund offered)."}
{"text":"Really great concept. Food is good and the coffee is super tasty. My little one loved it. We will definitely be back. Nice job."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Clean, fun and the food is good and the staff is nice! So great!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! My son has had many play dates here. It is so nice to sit back and relax while he plays. The Cafe has very tasty food. Not to mention my son has an absolute blast when we go there. The employees are very nice and helpful. The owner is great. This is a great place to play, especially in the hot summer heat!"}
{"text":"I am so happy we found this place. PlayGrounds loves both kids and their parents! My son loves playing with the little cars and as he has been getting taller has been able to explore more of the playground. I like how they have different areas for the crawlers, toddlers, and for the kids that are a little bit older.  I like that they have plenty of seating areas and comfy sofas. It is very convenient to be able to have food to order from the café and can I tell you how much I love that they have coffee? This is such a great idea. The staff there is always friendly. I have had great experiences with the other parents there. It's a great opportunity to model manners and appropriate play.  I'm excited to bring my son here a lot more during the summer. Make sure you remember your socks!"}
{"text":"Very chill casual open play place for kids of all ages and stages!   We took our 15 month old daughter here and were pleasantly surprised at the variety of little play areas available. She liked the toddler area to warm up, then it was on to the bigger kid side with all types of slides and tunnels up in the sky :) since she's younger and smaller my husband climbed in with her. The place was clean and offered a good amount of seating for parents to watch.   We enjoyed everything except for the fact that we forgot to take socks, so we had to buy some, and my yelp coupon was not accepted. I was told it was because my daughter is so young that it's already discounted enough. I thought that was kind of misleading, but not the biggest deal.   We will go again!"}
{"text":"Everything about it...is great. Food, coffee, and a place for your kids to run without heat exhaustion. Fantastic."}
{"text":"My son who's going to be 2 loved it! They have specialty areas for little ones and bigger kids. Lots of slides and climbing areas for kids to be kids. They also have a nice cafe and can do parties. Definitely a fun place to take the kids on those hot summer days."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place. There are just a few things I wish were different:  1. That the price wasn't 11 bucks for one kid. I would come here more if it was maybe 6-8 bucks  2. The food in general isn't good. I ordered a Cesar salad and it was tiny even for the half size and it was 5 bucks. Their pizza looked like they just threw it on a plate.  3. The employees that I dealt with didn't seem to enjoy their job it was super hard to get a smile out of them.   I do have to give them props though the place is super clean! I didn't feel like I was letting my kid play in something full of filth so thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with this place.  Our son enjoyed it very much.  The only problem was the kids really liked provoking each other on the little cars and running into each other.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Way over priced for a simple indoor playground! Seems that parents come to let their kids act like wild animals and not watch them!! Staff is rude and not friendly at all. Never again...waste of $$."}
{"text":"We went here with our 10 month old son and our 3.5 year old neice. We had a wonderful time, there was plenty of space to run around and it was also divided into younger/ old kid play areas. It was exactly what we needed,  my wife and I could enjoy an iced coffee in the A/C while the kids ran around and spent most of their energy. The other parents were all very nice and the kids played together well. When we were done we enjoyed a quiet drive home because the kids were passed out! We will be returning on those hot summer days when we dont want to deal with our local public pool."}
