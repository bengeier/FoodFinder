{"text":"Great BBQ and fast/casual family restaurant. I had the smoked turkey sandwich with fried green tomatoes and kale salad. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and Mac n cheese. Both sandwiches came with the two sides and a drink for roughly $10 each. Great portions, taste and value. Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! Friendly staff and clean place. We had the pork sandwich, two sides and a drink for 9 bucks. That's pretty cheap. This still is no Texas BBQ but some of the better I've had around here.  I would come back! The Mac and cheese was good and the sweet potato JoJo side was a neat twist!"}
{"text":"We're very glad this BBQ place popped up since Smoke closed down! Please keep in mind the 4 star rating is rating the actual meat. The brisket is delicious!! The pulled pork is super juicy and delicious as well! So since the meats are so good, it deserves more stars. Here's the review for the rest of the food items we have tried... The baked beans are good, if you like spice. I don't particularly like spicy beans, I'm more of the original Busches baked beans type of girl. The Mac n cheese is really good! The green bean casserole is a little too salty. I hate their bbq sauce. It's thin and vinegar based, not thick and sweet. I wish they had more sauce options instead of just that vinegar based one. If you can't tell, I don't like spice. We always get our order to go, and I use my own bbq sauce at home. The corn bread has jalapeños in it, which you guessed it, I also really dislike that. Give this place a shot! The meats are super delicious."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Live in Ballantyne and this location is much more convenient. The wings here are the best in Charlotte!! The amount of meat you get on these wings is amazing! I love that the specials change to add variety to the menu. I haven't tried anything that hasn't blown my mind! If your lucky enough to go on a night they have pork egg roll, fried corn, squash casserole, Mississippi mud slide or the fried green tomatoes you should give them a try! The corn bread has pieces of jalapeños in it!!!!!! FABULOUS!   I am not sure about this review below but having a business that is a week old and hiring a brand new staff these days isn't the easiest thing. Please don't base your choice of giving this place a try off someone that didn't even have patience to let them work through the kinks of opening week!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight and thought everything was very good. He had the brisket and I had the smoked wings. We both were very happy with what we ordered. We added 2 ribs to see how they were and they were cooked perfectly. For the sides we had greens, Mac and cheese, and Brunswick stew. The sides could have been a little warmer. Looking forward to trying the pulled pork. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Great food! The Thanksgiving sandwich is amazing! Staff is friendly and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Best barbeque in the world. Best service also. 2 ND visit and again was wonderful food and manager remembered us and again with a big smile!!! Love this place. It is our new favorite place. You must try everything. Great grit cakes. This will definitely be everyone's favorite place.  Thanks Moe's for treating us like VIPs!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this bbq a try for dinner tonight. Not what I was expecting. We ordered the ribs since ribs are my favorite bbq item. I must say, disappointed! Picking up my first rib, I could tell they were not going to be good. They were watery, not juicy but watery. I'm sure it's not the cooking method l, but I think it might be there reheating process. Needless to say, back to 521 or Jim and Nicks. Sorry, I wanted to like."}
{"text":"Just as great as their Matthews location! Love their sides and the ribs were amazing! Wife had the smoked chicken. Said it was some of the best she ever had. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"We have been multiple times already and everything has been awesome!  I love that the sides change everyday.  Glad they opened this location closer to home. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! Was looking forward to a good local bbq joint. Unfortunately, this one leaves lots to be desired. The mac n cheese is drowning in salt, the bbq sauce is bland, and the portions are a bit on the small side. The kids menu is decent, but when I asked for a kid-friendly drink, they told me the only option available is fountain lemonade (loaded with sugar). No milk or juice. Hope they make some changes soon, as the potential is there!"}
{"text":"First of all Service was awesome. We had to wait for ribs due to a technical error with the smoker. Which was ok. Was offered a comp for our wait. Second food was ok not the best bbq I have ever had but good. Not sure I would try again honestly."}
{"text":"You NEVER get a second chance to make a first impression......  After seeing PLENTY of marketing for the newest BBQ place in town.... and seeing that while the website \"specials\" were not terribly informative (ie \"Tuesday : beef brisket\" - no price no info about what makes it \"special\") I loaded up the family to give it a try...   Turns out there is no need for the specials to be very informative - because the girl at the counter said, \"oh we don't honor the specials because we are new....\". Aside from obvious customer service issues seems like they need to hire a 12 year old to make there web page a little more clear.....  I have no idea if the BBQ is decent or not - my rating (and the fact I will likely never try their BBQ is based solely on service and interaction with their employees who I assume are meant to be the face of the business)...  In the interest of being completely objective - I will say that I have heard a few folks say they liked the food.... but again in the interest of full disclosure - my kid thinks McDonald's burgers are good.... so I guess we all have different levels of expectations and different thresholds of acceptable service or taste for that matter....  My wife keeps insisting the girl probably was wrong and didn't know - if so that open a whole other reason for 1 star ratings.....  Maybe mgt will see this and make some obviously needed changes..... but my guess is that since I had to add the business to yelp - that they either expected this kind of feedback and were trying to avoid it OR they were not interested in feedback.....  ***update - this site does work!!! Apparently someone at moe's saw this and fixed the website - instead of one \"menu\" & list of \"specials\" - they have created two headings (one for each location) and the Waxhaw location says \"coming soon\".... maybe they will notify us al when they are officially 100% open with an accurate website and fully functioning restaurant.    ****yelp claims they removed my review because they were not sure it was a \"firsthand account of a personal experience\" - so let me state plainly - this was my firsthand experience - I am not a bot - hope that is clear enough!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that these guys were opening their second location in Waxhaw. The location is awesome and the food is just as good as it's always been at their Matthews location. My favorites are the brisket, pulled pork egg rolls, catfish and the jalapeño cheese grits! Yum! Perfect summer BBQ spot!"}
{"text":"Moe's has some of the best bbq around, and a great beer selection to boot. I was a big fan of their Matthews location so I thought u would try the waxhaw one as well, I was not disappointed. They are consistently some of the best bbq in the greater Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great new place! Their BBQ is just as good as the Matthews location! Favorite side is still the Mac and Cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is not too terrible, but it's not that great either. The cornbread and Mac n cheese were pretty dry. The pulled pork was good but there's definitely other places that have better. The decor of the place is cute and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"I tried Moe's for the first time this evening. The woman taking my order lacked tolerance and patience. Although there wasn't anyone behind me, she was rushed and seemed annoyed that I asked if there were additional sides other than the ones listed on the board as \"today's special sides\". I ordered the Cuban pork sandwich special since I'm not the biggest BBQ fan. The special came with 2 sides. I ordered the sweet potato casserole and the  Mac and cheese. I was pleasantly surprised on the first bite!!! The sweet potato casserole was off the chain good! The Mac and cheese was on point and the sandwich truly exceeded my expectations. It came on a bun with pickles, Cole slaw and a white sauce that tied the flavors together nicely.    It's too bad my first impression was with the disgruntled employee. Bottom line though, the food was amazing and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! We looked like first timers and the waitress helped us to navigate the menu. Choose between a sandwich and a platter then pick sides can be thought of as the general rule. Not too hungry today, so we opted for just a sandwich to get a feel for the flavor.   The sandwiches arrived quickly and were adequately proportioned with a decent amount of Smokey barbecue! We are vinegar-based lovers but added a touch of their table-side red sauce. A tad sweet for my palate but it was ok. The 'cue was very tender and the toasted bun was a nice touch.   Prices are very reasonable. We will go back to try the smoked wings and smoked shrimp!"}
{"text":"I hate to give a business a negative review, especially a new business in the neighborhood. I just left the place a few minutes ago and my only word of advice to a fairly new business is the following:  There are many patrons that will support local business and try something new in the area.  All patrons love great customer service and like to feel welcome to any business and first impressions are extremely important!  If you see a family walking in and even if your doing something have the common curtesy to greet them, second if your employees are having a bad day don't let them interact with customers.  I don't know if your food is so great that you feel customer service isn't needed, but the reason I walked right out with my family is because we walk in the place has maybe 5 tables occupied, a gentleman is sweeping as we enter the place and maybe we chose the wrong door but at least a hello you can place your order at the counter and take a seat should have been conveyed.  There is no one at the counter when the young lady comes out I asked how it works, do I order take a number and sit she looks at me like I'm stupid and replies like if I'm one of her peers with a snarky remark.  Never got a chance to taste their food and probably won't.  It's unfortunate as they are straight up the street and I'm a huge supporter of local business in our area.   I truly recommend that you reconsider your approach with people not sure if your business is self managed or you use hired employees.  In either case, you should either consider hiring better staff or someone that can run your business.  Best of luck, hope you can turn it around before it's too late."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for some good food here. I would have loved to grocery shop at HT and then pick up dinner but unfortunately I will not be taking my family here again. The food was so so. The Mac and cheese was tasteless and the chicken portions were very small. I am sad to say that the taste was not up to my standards."}
{"text":"Food is great, sides are awesome, chicken was phenomenal, decent selection of local beers as well!"}
{"text":"So good! I loved the blackened salmon sandwich and the Mac and cheese was amazing. They are working out the kinks that all new restaurants go through, but the food is so worth it! Can't wait to go back and try everything."}
