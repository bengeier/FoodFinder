{"text":"The food here is incredible.  Every part of the meal was perfectly cooked.  It's a hidden little place on Queen st and definitely worth checking out.  Probably one the best meals in Toronto without the pretentious over pricing"}
{"text":"The venue was great, and the food was a little salty. Overall the atmosphere was good until we got the bill. Gratuity was added onto our party, which is fine, but having the waitress give my wife attitude when she didn't give more tips is appalling. Would not recommend large parties to come here, unless you like being eyerolled."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was hella dry! Yarg!  Good service became non existent as soon as I paid the bill."}
{"text":"First, the place is so pretty! Love the neon sign always, and the decor is sooo nice. It's a small place but super chic.   Second, the food was amazinggg! We split two cocktails ($14 each) and 6 pieces K. F. C. the chicken bites are huge and flavourful. The Elena drink is super nice and floral.   What really topped it off and made it so special was how nice everyone working there is! They were super welcoming and chill, definitely made our visit there so much better. Would come back again just because of that!   Came at around 10:30 pm on Saturday before Christmas, no wait. Would come again anytime!"}
{"text":"I really debated between giving this place a three or a four. I gave it a four because I have such great affection for the Good Son (same chef or owner I believe). The service was really great and the music and ambiance were good. We started with cocktails on the rooftop patio. Be ware that the elevator is glacial (in pace and in temperature) so just take the stairs if you're physically able.   The food was all quite good, but not quite as good as the Good Son. I was a bit disappointed in the menu. It's quite small and a number of the dishes seem to be reworked items from the Good Son. I'm a bit unclear about how this place is different from the Good Son. It feels like a slightly lesser copy.   Anyhow, we ordered the fish tacos, pork belly, oysters, kale salad, broccoli, fried chicken and a few other dishes I can't recall. All were very good and worth trying.   If for some reason you don't want to venture to the Good Son, this is a good second choice! Quite good food, good service and better than many other restaurants is the best praise I can give it."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE is more like the name it should be.  Slow service. The restaurant was sooo slow literally no one was there on a Saturday night. But food came out slow and service was bad. Doesn't feel like managers run this place. Ordered the fried chicken and it was so dry, and black. This menu has no soul or creativity. Nothing is original on the menu, burgers look like Shake shack, Korean fried chicken like all places, chicken and waffles yawn, fish tacos, avocado toast, fried Brussels sprouts, lettuce wrap whatever. Everything that is instagram popular but the kitchen doesn't do it as good as other places. Never again. Do not try this place."}
{"text":"Love the cocktails, the service is amazing and their food is delicious. I've been here a few times now and the menu hasn't disappointed so far. Highly recommend the DND burger and their fries are to die for! Also can't say enough good things about their salted chocolate chip cookies and milk! I'm not even a sweets person."}
{"text":"So glad I came across this place on Queen. Brunch done right. The avocado toast was amazing and the side of Latkas was a perfect pairing. Found out the Chef of the same as The Good Son which is awesome. Will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for Valentine's and I would definitely come back again for special occasions! The staff were all friendly and the environment was cozy and romantic.  We ordered the Valentine's prixe fixe menu and had the charcuterie board which was very nice to begin with. Next we each selected a starter; I had the salmon tartare and she had the Nona's meatball.  Both were delicious, especially the polenta that came with the meatballs.  Now the main!  We opted for the Bo Ssam and were we delighted by the presentation. But what stole the show was the Spicy Brussels! Crispy, sweet, tender and a hint of spiciness.... A must get!  Dessert was a nice finish to the meal. The lava cake was very chocolatey without being overly sweet... Just the way I like my dessert!  Our server Ryan was a delight. A charming fellow with an English accent who reminded me of James McAvoy. He regularly checked on us and made sure we were taken care of.  No brainer to come back if we're in the general area again!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best dinning experiences my husband and I have ever had. We were celebrating an anniversary. Our server, Ryan, was so fantastic. He was into his job, the food, and loved the place. The food - was absolutely outstanding. Not a single thing we had needed improvement. The milk and cookies are adorable. The cocktails are great. And the space! The space is stunning. Go here. It's hard in Toronto to know where to go - so many places. But this place deserves some attention. We shall be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a business meeting and was absolutely delighted with the place.  The decor was really cute, and the music wasn't too loud so we could have a conversation.  Service was very friendly and attentive as well.  But let's get to the important part...the food.  YUM!    The menu is eclectic and good for sharing, or having your own meals.  I was able to try a few different things.    Fish taco - good flavour, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spice, and this was too much for me.  In the grand scheme of things I don't think it was actually THAT spicy if you're able to handle a bit of spice.  To be honest though, it's not the best fish taco I've had.  Toronto has loads of great Mexican restaurants so I would skip this one and have fish tacos another night.  Fried chicken - YUM!  The chicken on it's own was good, but you HAVE to try it with the buttermilk dill sauce.  The sauce alone made it one of the best fried chicken's I've tasted.  Cornbread - Interesting take on the cornbread with the sauce on top.  It was unique, moist and had layers of flavour with the cheese, jalapenos (not very spicy though), and the sauce (I can't remember what it was).    Fried rice - This was also really tasty.  I like the different textures with some of the rice being a bit crunchy and the poached egg on top.    Grilled romaine salad - Grilled romaines can so easily be over done but this one was perfect.  It had a good mix of crunch and softer grilled pieces.    It looks like they change their menu up every now and then, so I look forward to coming back and trying some new things.    They have a cute little shop in front too with Toronto inspired home and gift items."}
{"text":"Brunch at the Beverly is amazing! The menu items are varied and so comforting. We tried a bunch of stuff including the avocado toast, cornbread, los rancheros, fries, latkes and last but not least the fried chicken!  Everything was so good, and we shared so I could try a bit of everything. The cornbread is really special and it comes with a delicious sauce on top. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy and boneless so it was really easy to eat."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has the best find!  The drinks are over the top amazing, try the cocktail tasting they randomly offer....such a great place. The fried chicken, oysters, eggs Benedict, Brussels sprouts were all to die for! We will be back next visit"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday with a party of 3. Had amazing service, a great server and delicious food. Loved the decor, it's a smaller place but a nice ambiance. Shared a few dishes among the table. Beef lettuce wraps, fried chicken, kale, Brussels, pho, fish tacos. The kale salad and the fried chicken were my faves. The Brussels were out of this world. Will definitely be coming back. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a few friends  Place is small with a cozy ambiance. Good for small gatherings with close friends to have a good conversations or a chill date.   The food is distributed between small and large plates. The small plates can be used for sharing or can be eaten by an individual. The larger plates are there for a person with a larger appetite  Main: Korean Chicken: comes in 3 or 6 pieces (6 pieces you can share with a group). The chicken is a breast that is moist on the inside and although saucy, is crunchy as well. The sauce is a spicy Asian sauce that is really tasty. If only they could sell it as a bucket of 9 or 12 pieces lol  The other dishes eaten by my friends were also delicious and are posted as pics. My friend who recommended this place says they regularly change their menu. It will be good to see what other new dishes will come to the menu."}
