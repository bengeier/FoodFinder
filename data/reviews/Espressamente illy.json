{"text":"I've been to Italy and while this gelato isn't exactly authentic, it's good. Prices are a little high (it is after all yet another \"Shoppes\" area of a high-end casino), at $5.50 for a single scoop, you have to expect better. The service wasn't great either. I went twice and, each time, not ONE of the five staff behind the counter greets or even acknowledges you. There is a sign stating where the line begins, but it's next to a column that, when the store gets busy, really does nothing to help the line form. On my second visit 12/28/12 at 11:00pm, we ordered a crepe but were rudely told by the girl behind the counter, \"we don't make crepes no more tonight\"...ciao honey"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while walking by one morning because we saw signs for crepes and smoothies.  When I tried to order my crepe and smoothie they got my smoothie order wrong.  That alone would have been fine, but when I pointed out to them that that was not what I ordered they called me a liar.  Another staff had to step in to tell the girl behind the register to back down and make me what I asked for.

The crepe wasn't bad, the fruit on top was good.  The smoothie actually wasn't great, I asked for some kind of mango smoothie, the wrong one they made me was strawberry and after drinking the mango one I wished I'd have taken the first one they made me.

Don't recall exactly what I paid but it felt steep for what it was, pretty meh food, and unprofessional service get 2 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I work at the Palazzo/Venetian Casino in one of the shoppes here. So this is my everyday cafe. I eat here everyday even on my days off. It's always super clean, and I'm never disappointed when  I leave this place. This food is delicious, I've had they're wraps, sandwiches, and pizzas. They're coffee is just impeccable!!

    I notice people are complaining about the prices...Seriously? It's in Las Vegas, NV, one of the top tourist locations in the WORLD. It's also located in a Hotel/Casino, its like buy something at an airport. Also, the Casino is located ON THE STRIP. But, I'm just saying. I've only lived here all my life....

    And that guy who mentioned that illy is cheaper in Italy, well no crap Sherlock. Of course it will be more expensive some where else because it is imported. It's like whole sale, you buy a bulk of something then you sale it at a price where you can make profit, enough profit where you can buy some more product and to keep for your company; to pay your employees and the bills etc... Come on you're running a business, that location at the Palazzo was just not given to them with free rent...

    And of course its called Espressamente illy, its an illy company, concentrating on illy coffee. All the pastries they order from a restaurant at the Palazzo, and as well as the gelato. You can't blame the cafe for it not being good that day. 
    For the people complaining about it being to busy, you have to notice that the cafe is right by a convention center...Of course it will be busy.

    As for the coffee.. It will depend on the Barista who makes it for you. All of the employees might be briefly trained about the machines, but you can't expect them to make it all the same. For the original Baristas, it not only depends on how they make the coffee but the way the calibrated the machines as well. 

The Barista's I recommend: Guillermo, Jennifer, and Samuel..

    And if you just think that illy coffee just does not taste good, read they're mission statement..  (illy.com)

    And please don't think that because I work at the shoppes that I'm just making it up, I've actually started coming to this cafe way before I started working at the Palazzo/Venetian shoppes.."}
{"text":"When I first came here this place was really nice, clean and inviting. Now it's not clean, hand prints everywhere, unfriendly service. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"If you enjoy real coffee, and not those ridiculous concoctions they make at places like starbucks that happen to have a shot of espresso mixed in, then this place is coffee heaven on earth for you.  Order a double machiato caldo. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Unless you like your crepes really plain - don't bother with this place. The price is just not worth it. $9 for a mixed berry crepe with three SMALL pieces of berries. There were a few crepes laid out for examples, and I thought the fruit on some of them were just for decoration because there was just so little. Hahaha, no. 

If you want gelato, I reccommend that little gelato stand in the Canals instead. I've stayed at the Venetian and Palazzo around 5 times combined in the past year and I ALWAYS get the mango sorbet from that stand. It's so light and fluffy, and so sweet, and omg I WANT IT NOW."}
{"text":"I think this place was so confusing! There was a big crowd here and we wanted gelato, but the hec if we knew where the line was. Apparently you have to pay first and get a receipt and then go to the gelato counter and hand them your receipt and order your gelato. First off, there are no signs that say line forms here and there is no place that says pay first. So everyone is trying to order and they are told nope, go back and pay first, then come back. That's just a waste of their time and my time. Don't you think? My lemon gelato wasn't even worth the crowd. The plus is that they have other food to order and espresso."}
{"text":"This place gives Illy a bad name... poor service, the barista lack knowledge and skill... and it makes me want to buy them a cup of cappuccino and ask them if this is really what they want to serve to their customers, and then leave before I hear their response. 

I love Illy coffee beans (I brew it everyday at home) but this experience was a sad disappointment. 

If you're going to try it despite my warning, good luck! I hope the odds are in your favor. Also, they charge for Dine-In \"service\"..."}
{"text":"yum yum. I wish they would open more of these in the US. Warning: its expensive, even by vegas standards, but if you love coffee, The americanos here will make you realize how bad the US chains are (starbucks and peets). Gelato do die for, and lots and lots of sugar free options (you would never ever guess they are in fact sugar free). Its just about the best gelato ive had outside of Milan -- didnt have the crepes, and seems on here, many not to thrilled with them but for insane good coffee and frozen treats, this is the BOMB. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of gelatos!

You know the expression \"your eyes are bigger than your stomach\"? Well, everytime I go into an ice cream parlor and see a looonnngg stretch of various flavors, I get excited and start imagining getting a multiscoop behemoth to eat. All by myself, too!

The gelato counter is the first thing you see from the entrance, and all the bright colors are just dazzling. Once you get over the hypnotic display, you take a closer look and realize just how many different flavors there are.

I was torn between the amaretto or the tiramisu flavors, but ended going with the tiramisu because it had a certain \"bite\" to it. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it was laced with a bit of marsala or some other alcohol =).  I only got one scoop because I was full from dinner, and I was a bit startled by the sticker shock. Almost $6 for one scoop??

Then, I got the scoop and it was pretty big. In fact, my single scoop almost looked like the size of my friend's double scoop! 

The gelato itself was definitely rich and creamy; everything you look for in a good gelato. It had tons of flavor (along with the \"kick\" mentioned earlier). I would definitely recommend that you try out the tiramisu flavor if you stop by.  Also, a single scoop is definitely enough for one person, because I couldn't even finish mine completely (and I can eat a whole Ghirardelli's Square sundae by myself).  However, I think that is due to the richness of the gelato itself."}
{"text":"Crispy flakey lovely croissant!! Decent coffee, but compared to the rest around  its the the really nice!"}
{"text":"OH MY, HAVE MERCY, THIS PLACE IS HEAVEN!!

My husband and I stayed at the Palazzo just this past weekend and I was totally craving gelato. And what do I see on the corner next to the shoppes.. THIS HEAVENLY GELATO SHOPPE.

Let me just tell you- FLAVORS GALORE!! I couldnt pick! I must have tried almost every sample and they were all so heavenly. And because of the many flavors, for a quick second I was truly disappointed that on their pricing menu they only priced 1 or 2 flavors (thinkin to myself, but what if I wanted 3 flavors?). So that disappointment quickly ended when I saw the person in front of me order two scoops- their scoops were HUGE! Of all the gelato places I've been here in SD, theyve typically given us miniature scoops in a cute little bowl. Ooh haayL not here buddy, they were super generous!!

Since we just had italian food, I didnt wanna go too crazy with all the different flavors they had so I chose Pistachio and Hazelnut and oh my goodness, it definitely hit the spot.

From now on, this will be a MUST STOP for me everytime I head out that way. I HIGHLY recommend you try this place- Im tellin you, its truly worth your time.

But then again, its just my opinion."}
{"text":"Ordered an iced latte here... it tasted like an iced coffee? Slightly disappointed in the taste."}
{"text":"Their panini was surprisingly delightful! Ordered the prosuitto with mozzarella and tomato. Bread was nicely toasted, crispy on outside and warm and delectable on the inside. Comes with side of potato chips.

This Italian Gelato Panini Express cafe was better than expected."}
{"text":"Unfriendly place. Chicken Caesar salad is terrible. Dry chicken breast. Spoil lettuces. Couldn't finish the shit at all."}
{"text":"While the entire casino waits in long line for dinner at restaurants, this place is empty (!) and has all the causal meals you need like salads and sandwiches. And you get delicious Italian ice for dessert"}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Yummy desserts and amazing coffee. Staff also very nice. Been there both on weekday and weekend, can get extremely busy/crowed on the weekends."}
{"text":"If you're an Aussie looking for a decent coffee in Vegas go here to Espressamente Illy. Owned & Made by an Italian, they added an extra shot or two until I was satisfied with my Latte. Hubby happy with his \"wet\"Cappuccino, as they are called in USA. Staff were all extremely nice, friendly & only too happy to cater to your needs. Pastries were good too. Thanks again for making our Vegas stay happy with your coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee making as a craft. Perfectly made latte and excellent pastries. The Yorkdale location brings a lot of craziness and commotion but still worth a visit."}
{"text":"The service is pretty subpar and the prices are pretty expensive but the pineapple tropical smoothie is amazing! It taste like a dole whip from Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Illy always has the best coffee...I mean, it's the best I've ever had. Who wouldn't love Italian coffee? The cappuccino was pretty expensive though. 

My rating is based strictly on my experience with the coffee. I haven't had the opportunity to try the pastries or gelato. Of all coffee places on the strip, I would say this is THE place I'd go for a cappuccino."}
{"text":"Coffee is delicious staff is rude. I felt like I was irritating the worker.  Sad because this is the main reason I stay at the Venetian."}
{"text":"Ham Omelette was fantastic and could feed two people. The coffees were interesting -different than what expected. Would return for the omelette"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a quick coffee or a gelato. Lines are usually short and there are always seats. Prices are a bit high. Service is okay."}
{"text":"The staff would benefit from customer service training. They can start with the basics - please and thank you, oh and a smile would be great!  Particularly since I'm paying double CA prices! I asked for a double espresso and while I have the quantity, it lacks the quality. Despite as a general rule that a double shot has more room for error than a single, not in my case.
@ $12.71 for two double shots, you decide."}
{"text":"Amazing big coffee shop in Yorkdale mall, they serve a lot of unique coffee specialty drinks and nice desserts as well. The cafe has wonderful seating including a big balcony where you can oversee the mall. Give their 5 grain muffins a try as well as their ice cream coffees. The traffic flow could use some work at illy as even with a small amount of people it got a little slow and confusing. This place is comparable to somewhere like Aroma or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Cozy and convenient. Awesome frozen treats come in a tantalizing variety. However, the sandwiches and salads are premade and a bit stale, dry and/or wilted by early evening. 

Coffee is excellent--robust, hot, smooth."}
{"text":"My bf and I are HUGE fans of their tiramisu here and since I had major cravings for it last night, the guy decided to take me here. They had a decent amount of people standing in line for the gelato, but none waiting to get coffee or the other desserts. I was greeted by a cashier that looked, spoke, and acted like she had a horrible day..which I totally understood. But then she decided it was okay to take it out on us. We ordered two tiramisus and a bottle of water, and I was suppose to order a cappuccino but before I finished my sentence, she walked away. That turned me off so I decided not to order it anymore. I gave her the cash, she gave me the change back, I smiled and said thank you. And she still looked at me like I owe her money! 

I've been here several times and have been dealt by the same cashier before, but I never minded her attitude because the food made up for it. I thought one time, eh..ok she deserves another chance. But another time is  another story. Anyway, the food and coffee here are still good so I only reduced it down from 5 to 4 stars. I love love love that tiramisu!!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is really good! I had a Hot Vanilla Latte which beat Starbucks by far. I had it 2 days in a row and both times it was good and not burnt. With other coffee shops, it can be a hit or miss with burnt coffee which is not good."}
{"text":"Illy is up there for me as one of my favorite espresso brands of all times, so I was really looking forward to coming here for Affogato. So, I had the affogato last week with vanilla gelato and it was super disappointing with bland gelato and a measly portion as well. My friend got the heath cookie gelato and it was also super bland and unfortunate. The illy espresso was tasty, but that was a given. This place was overpriced, which is to be expected in Vegas,  and I wouldn't have minded if it actually tasted good! I felt like I had wasted money and calories and it totally wasn't worth it. I should have just gotten the straight up espresso and would have walked away happy."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, a bit pricey but understandable since its located inside the hotel , service was bad, rude lady in the cashier.. should be trained for hospitality!! Isnt it a hospitality bussiness?"}
{"text":"I only vouch for their coffee... Love the sourly taste of the illy coffee and if u like special espresso drink, go for \"amore\" :)"}
{"text":"THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE  REASONS THAT I LOVE TO STAY AT PALLAZZO. They have a drink called amore with an espresso shot at the bottom with some non alcoholic liquor and heavy cream at the top so essentially the drink looks black and white. Also I had an affigato here which was to die for."}
{"text":"Horrific service. Paid $9 for a bagel sandwich and was offered no choice of bagel. The cashier decided I was having sesame. When my order came up, along with my husbands (he was only allowed a plain bagel) and some other dude's, I tried to ask which one was mine. She just screamed \"ARE YOU TOGETHER OR NOT??\". I had to open some strangers coffee to try and figure out if it was my latte or not. $19 for a latte and a bagel sandwich, neither of which was very good.  I'm telling you, never again."}
{"text":"Rude service by one of the staff was unnecessary for an early Saturday morning. Croissants made up for it."}
{"text":"The cashier lady was very nice and sweet but horrible attitude from the almost bald gentleman who calls the names and hand over the orders. Please learn that you are here to serve your customers so leave the attitude at home."}
{"text":"The staff looks miserable working there, but the gelatos are yummy so I keep going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the crepes after reading some other good reviews. I wasn't impressed. I had the banana, strawberry, chocolate crepe. It wasn't bad, I mean put those three together and anything will taste good. But it wasn't spectacular. The crepes were too thick for me and didn't taste fresh. Honestly, I like the crepes at ihop better and they are half the cost. I wouldn't come again for the crepes. The coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Good espresso but $4 for a single seems a little pricey even for Vegas. Service wasn't great either, the employees got through the line quickly enough but they weren't too friendly while doing so!"}
{"text":"We always stop here for some gelato and crepe whenever we are staying at the Palazzo.  We just love everything about this plac and had been a loyal customer for more than 5 years.  Price is a little pricey being in a classy hotel but well worth it."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as it was highly recommended by a friend.  It's located on the first floor of the Venetian in a great location.

Unfortunately, I came away a little disappointed.  The specialty coffees are served European style in small cups.  I tried one of the specialty coffee and thought is was ok.  

I also had the hazelnut gellato:  too grainy and a little powdery.  The mango gellato that our son tried was better but the consistency was akin to sorbet.

For the price, even for Vegas, I expected better."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick expresso. I waited behind the counter for a few minutes while two employees carried out a conversation in Spanish. They glanced at me a few times before one of them finally acknowledged me and said \"go down there bud\" as he motioned with his head. I found this to be extremely rude. A normal response would have been something like \"Hello, how are you? Sorry, this register is closed, we can take care of you down there.\" 

I go to the next counter and they don't follow me down to offer service (like ten feet). The other two employees behind the counter are also chatting and joking about something very loudly and completely ignoring the five of us waiting. One of them had a mohawk. Being in a hurry it this should have been a quick stop. But no, I wait. Then wait some more. There are other guests were waiting too and I don't want to cut in from of them. 

Finally a fifth guy walks out and says \"what can I get you?\". How warm. 

He sells me the expresso which was good but way over priced. 

One star because the only thing you have to do at an expresso bar is make the drinks quickly and be friendly. That's it. When you do neither, you're one star."}
{"text":"I was walking around early in the morning trying to find a decent cup of coffee. My friend recommended this place and I happened to wander around and run into this place. They have well lit glass cases filled with delectable treats. I was tempted to get something buttery but I decided that I just wanted coffee. I ordered a caramel machiato large and spent $7.57; which is outrageous! This was the most expensive cup of coffee I ever had. But the flavor was good and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. But I'm in Vegas and stuck so I paid the high price. It was good to try once but probably will try a different place next time. They have the cutest display of espresso cups lined up one of the posts. Check it out, very neat."}
{"text":"One of the best services, very friendly staff, great food at a great price, our company is very satisfied with their catering, thank you Vladimir for all what you did for us"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, the selection of desserts and drinks.
Staff are always friendly too.

One knock... a couple of times the dining ware (plates, mugs or glasses) were not 100% clean.

UPDATE : just went again today, Torta al Cioccolato was under done, cashier was unpleasant - taking away one star."}
{"text":"I love this place, but some of them are a bit pricey. The gluten free muffins were a bit sweet. The blueberry cheese danish is good. Sometimes too much sugar in the cream cheese. The latte is excellent. It's what keeps me coming back for more. I like the sandwiches on ciabatta bread as well. Some of them good. Some of them soggy. I like the washrooms too. They are nice and clean. There used to be vegan truffles, but they don't don't carry them anymore. It's called Dolce. The people behind the counter are very friendly and service always comes with a smile."}
{"text":"Good cappuccini, but: 1. Charging $6 is excessive; 2. And more upsetting, charging a dine-in fee for the cup is ridiculous... You try to reduce trash and in effect get less coffee and are charged more? C'mon."}
{"text":"This cafe is inside Yorkdale Shopping Centre, located on the second level where you take the escalator up to the food court. 

Small but very cozy place. Excellent espresso and espresso drinks, illy is what they use as the name says it. Don't miss out their pastries, fresh, flaky, buttery......in a lot of varieties."}
{"text":"We all ordered gelato here last week and the stuff was excellent!  The only reason I did not rate this place a 5 is due to the astronomical pricing of the gelato.......come on ILLY......30 bucks for 4 single scoop gelatos:-("}
{"text":"The best dessert cafe in all of Toronto (thus far). Their desserts are obviously better than and much more superior to Starbucks,  second cup and aroma and many other desert cafes I've tried. 

My favorite is the Tiramisu..I drive to yorkdale just for this! *mouth waters* my husband comes here for the cannot I'm which I must admit are also very delicious. 

As for their coffee, comparable to second cup (I'm a huge second cup fan). Very good but nothing out of this world. Their service was fast and friendly. They lose a star for the coffee, they messed up my husband's dopio long espresso machiatto twice. If you're a reputable coffee place that does coffee right, a machiatto should be a no brained! 

Decor is lovely, great atmosphere, very clean store overall.

I'll definitely keep coming back for my Tiramisu!!!"}
{"text":"At first I was excited that a gourmet coffee shop had opened up in Yorkdale where I do most of my sopping, but was disappointed once I tasted some of their goodies. The orange almond muffin I tried was stale and the goodies seemed like they were sitting there for at least over 24 hours. I'm a baker so I notice these things, instead of using orange juice or zest like you should in a gourmet baked good, they had used concentrated orange flavour which gave left a bitter chemical after taste in my mouth, and no real butter. 

However the coffee was god and it wasn't too busy. It was a great place to sit down and take a break while shopping."}
{"text":"I go back when I am in Vegas because the coffee is good but this last time over Thanksgiving, the customer service soured me on this place. We waited for someone to help us where we thought was the right \"line\", we waited and waited. Finally, the counter lady said the line was some where else, a few steps away. She saw us there waiting and let us wait and made us go to some other lady to order. Then after ordering, waiting some more for our coffee, we notice the other lady helping customers after she made us go somewhere else! Basically, service sucks. Please refresh on your customer service skills or get new employees so I can return and enjoy your coffee."}
{"text":"On my way walking back to the Palazzo at 11:30pm, I wanted gelato. First, we went to Cocolini which is located in the St. Mark's square but it was closed. We were instructed to go to IIIy. The price here definitely gone up! It is now  $5.50 one scope and $7.5 for two! Cone is $1.5 more. They also changed their serving cup which looks the same as Cocolini when I saw it in yelp just now.

I wanted the pina calada gelato but they didn't carry the favor. I had the passion fruit gelato but didn't like it... too sour... My friend had the watermelon but it tastes a bit watery... maybe because my passion fruit tasted stronger. I wanted gelato again the next day and went to Tintoretto which is located at the far entrance of canal shoppers and had much better gelato. Their gelato is also less pricey which is a little under $5 including tax and sugar cone!"}
{"text":"Pros: It's in Vegas. The interior is open and bright. The cappucino was strong yet delightful. (1 star for location, 2 stars fo espresso).

Cons: The service was less than desirable. Even that was better than napoleon- stale, rubbery and lacking goo flavor. Avoid the pastries! (0 stars for bake goods). 

Want fabulous chocolates? Head to Vosges @ Caesars."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

I have had some good gelato, but this gelato was pretty sweet! I had blood orange flavor and it was smooth and silky almost. It tasted so go. I liked how they put a little wafer cookie in the gelato. Oh and it wasnt like $16 like it was in a different casino. It was about 5 bucks and all the more delicious! I would love to go back! 

The guy was very patient with me, trying all the flavors I did. I just could not decide because there were flavors I have never even heard of and I was like a kid in  a candy store! It was a good night to have ended it there! :)"}
{"text":"Great espresso and pastries as well as amazing presentation. The only downside to this place is a lack of organization - 3 people helped me with a shot of espresso and a pastry. Customers and employees were extremely confused what to do where to order and pay - it can get frustrating."}
{"text":"I came by around 11:30pm and had never tried this coffee place before and figured I'd give it a shot. So just keep in mind that they close the kitchen around 11pm. If you want food show up earlier than that.

My experience is based only on my interaction with an employee named Jose and simply the coffee he made for me.

I asked what they were known for and he said the caramel macchiato, I agreed. I wanted food but I had shown up too late, that's okay no problems there. But simply the way he talks to customers and the coffee he makes... Makes this review a 5 star. By far the best drink I've had in long time. He didn't make me feel bad for coming in late, or asking plenty of questions. Exactly what I look for in customer service, being that I work in that field.

If management sees this, give this man a promotion or something! He deserves it by his display of exceptional customer service. Thank you Jose, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Oh man, gelato, you are veryyy pricey here (~$6 for one scoop). I was tempted but convinced myself to get a berry crepe instead for ~$12. It was quite good. Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, whipped cream on top of a chocolate/nutella and strawberry sauce filled crepe. The strawberry sauce was a little too much for me. A little too sweet. But everything else was good. Of course it's not as cheap as crepes back at home around $5-6 but it will have to do for Vegas. 

As for service, the man who served us was very friendly, took our plate out of the way when we were done eating, and reminded us we could stay and keep talking."}
{"text":"I love Illy cafe, is the beast italian coffee in the world. Every time I'm at the Palazo Venetian hotel I stop at this place, and drink the beast cappuccino.
Make me fill in Italy."}
{"text":"I like this place. The staff is decently cordial, and the gelato is amazing. Unfortunately, there are only a couple vegetarian options for lunch including a caprese and a mozzarella and tomato pizza, but otherwise, the atmosphere is nice. Plus, they have a great chai tea latte."}
{"text":"I have a lot of idiot moments. Like when I ordered the \"tart with the pear on it\" and the woman behind the counter said \"Oh, the pear tart?\" Yeah, that. 

Well, luckily the pear tart was amazing. I'd been craving some kind of pear tart for months. Not really sure why. I had a frozen coffee drink which was also fabulous and for a cappuccino, it wasn't too bitter and just the right amount of sweet.

We got a little turned around trying to find it (don't spend much time at palazzo) and when asking for it, most of the staff just refer to it as \"the Italian coffee place\". Probably safe to just ask for that. 

The atmosphere was nice and a little less Vegas-y than the usual coffee shops. Felt almost like I could be in a train station somewhere other than the middle of the desert."}
{"text":"The gelato was just ok. I expected much more but it was just ok. Service was very good. I asked for a cup of water and they gave me a free bottle so that was a plus. Even though I am giving 3 stars I will give this place another try next time I am in area."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I wanted gelato and they had many flavors so I wanted to try them. After two I was still undecided and was asking for third and the guy was 3 samples only are you sure you want to try this one? We had 3 people in our group and we all were going to purchase. It left a sour mood. I never been to an ice cream place that doesn't give samples. The gelato is mediocre and expensive. Never ever coming back"}
{"text":"Terrible staff the morning we visited. Cashier did not pay attention to me as I ordered. Missed items, asked me if my items were to go or eat in, really didn't matter what my answer was as she did the opposite. The tall male manager on duty was also no help. Apologizing to me as he rung up my missed item. An overpriced joke."}
{"text":"The latte here is great.  And the pastry and cheesecake are delicious.  I had the pistachio cheesecake.  It is smooth and has the right amount of flavour.  But the real reason they can charge so high a price (7.95 for a tiny piece of cake) is the patio, overlooking the mall floor filled with shoppers below.  Instead of lining up for 15 min. inside the hot sweaty Starbucks, I will gladly pay up for a table here."}
{"text":"Starting your day with a White Mocha Latte, Caramel Ice Latte, or Half and Half (Chocolate & Coffee) is really the best way to go! MmMmMm, I love Illy Coffee!!  Along with eye opening delicious beverages, Bacon, Cheese, Egg Panini Croissant or Sausage, Cheese, Egg Panini Croissant is also very tasty!  Then finishing off with an Apple Cinnamon Caramel Crepe .... mMmMm, what a wonderful way to begin your day in Vegas (without alcohol...yet)!?  White Mocha Latte for the win!"}
{"text":"Food: 
I ordered a bacon and egg croissant which was decent but not worth $10.

Service:
Decent service. Quick but not friendly. 

Atmosphere: 
Great seating area. It can accommodate a large group of friends. Cool place to have a morning coffee and converse with friends."}
{"text":"Espressamente illy initially captured my attention more than any other food offerings at Yorkdale for its unique location on a dedicated floor right below the food court. I finally decided to pay a visit with a friend for a cup of joe. The drinks are definitely on the pricier side but it is quite nice if you want a quiet spot to relax and enjoy a conversation. The staff are quite friendly and approachable. I would definitely recommend this spot for people who need an escape the crowds of the mall."}
{"text":"Half and half  = Hot coco + espresso... SO GOOD~~~ and I don't usually drink coffee...."}
{"text":"Good strong espresso drinks inside the Venetian right next to the LOVE sculpture. Prices weren't crazy either. They have a large gelato selection as well."}
{"text":"It's an upscale ice cream stand- get over it.  Gelato was good, selection and service was good. Service for the time of eve and length of the line was also good. But hey, when your in a hotel like the Venetian it's expected isn't it?"}
{"text":"Espressos good, gelato isn't. 

When you need a little pick me up, like a legal one - in Vegas, this is definitely a solid choice! Who wants disgusting hotel drip coffee? Not me - hopefully not you!

Here, at least you know they're using decent espresso beans.

The gelato - like most hotel gelato out here, is a total fail. I'd say try whatever flavor you have in mind because most that I thought would be guaranteed delish were not and I settled on birthday cake, which was just ok after trying three others. My boyfriend ordered butter pecan and did not like it. I think he said, not only is it not good - it's bad. Never a good thing!

Open until 1A which is a plus. We stopped in after a late night dinner."}
{"text":"During my recent Vegas trip, I was desperately in need of good coffee. My husband and I have looked everywhere and  tried coffee offered in many different shops and hotels (there was a Coffee Bean right at the entrance to our hotel rooms); however, our search for a good decent edible cup of coffee as a pick me up was met only with much disappointment.  

Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we stumbled upon Expressamente in the passage way between Palazzo and Venetian... We didn't have much expectation when we first found this place b/c of the disappointments in our prior days of search... But man when I had a sip of their latte, I had a sigh of relief ... We finally found a cup of coffee that is at least edible and enjoyable - with nice coffee bean taste instead of just pure sugar/cream taste or burnt coffee taste... Finally, a piece of heaven :)

My husband is much pickier of his coffee... he's a third-wave coffee hipster or what you may call a coffee connoisseur...tho the coffee here still didn't meet his standard... At least it filled my craving and need for a cup of edible and enjoyable coffee. So I'd say if you can't find anything (coffee wise) you like in LV, try this place ;)

In addition, I'd add that their crepe is pretty good too. We ordered the very berry and chocolate crepe. It was pleasing to the eyes. Taste was average to me.  I'll try to add a photo for you."}
{"text":"Their service sucks! All the workers were chit chatting. They didn't ask customers what they need- impolite interaction. 2 thumbs down"}
{"text":"A nice little treat after eating at any of the restaurants nearby.  Its pricy, but the gelato is very good.

I have have not tried the beverages, and that may be where its at. I wouldn't make a special trip here."}
{"text":"i luv the coffee here....but it is pricey! it was ever so smooth and thinking about it makes me want more! hubby had a yummy caramel macchiato and i had an iced froth coffee and they were both good....way better than starbucks! if im here again i will go back!"}
{"text":"We tried the cannoli today and both me and my friend didn't like it.  He said it was not good in texture and very heavy.  My sentiments were the same.  And the biscuit outer shell was stale.  I had asked the server if the cannoli was fresh and he said it was made same day.

The cafe was clean and had nice decor.  I would like to try their coffee one day.  I thought prices were on the high side."}
{"text":"When you need some caffeine versus retail therapy, this cafe is the perfect place!

I like how there is a bright private self-seating area to relax for a little bit.
All the desserts looked amazing!
And they do have soy and almond milk options available instead of milk (+$0.75).

The drinks are expensive here.
The cakes are too, but they are worth it and delicious!
I was impressed by the selection of sweets.

However, if I were here on a date, I might feel a bit awkward having to wait in a long line up cafeteria style.  And if there isn't a table available, you could be standing around waiting for a bit!

Anyways, I'm sure I will stop by here again. :D"}
{"text":"Coffee here is great, as you should expect. However, the service falls flat on its face. The point of coffee at an espresso bar is hot and fresh. Things need to be served to you right off the machine. However, here your order fits in with all of the rest of the food orders and such, and your cup will most likely languish in the pass, waiting for someone to finish doing whatever they are doing and then they will call the numbers out. Coffee is not the accent here, it's less than a third of all the \"stuff\" they sell - the coffee should be split from the food service, which takes them much more time. In my case, the guy who should have been running the pass disappears into the back room, and the cashier happened to notice I was standing there and came down to call out the numbers of the stuff he left. Pathetic (she got the tip though). There are too many Starbucks spots around to worry about coming here for your espresso fix. If they treated espresso as it is done in Italy, this would be top notch, but it's a Vegas Blvd experience."}
{"text":"While exploring the new Palazzo, we found ourselves in front of this brightly lit up shee-shee fancy coffee shop/dessert place/whathaveyou. What caught our eye was the gelato and although they offered much more, I wasn't paying attention. 

Like the other Yelpers, it was pricey and when I saw the prices, I told my mom that I didn't want anything, but she insisted (gotta love moms!) since she wanted some gelato bad. I chose one scoop of the canteloupe gelato and my mom got one scoop of the lychee gelato. Both were very refreshing and full of yummy fruit flavor!

Not sure if it'll be a \"must stop at spot\" for future Vegas visits, but I would like to try their raved coffee in the future."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not a friendly place to spend any downtown in Las Vegas. A vanilla latte and double espresso ran us $14! I rather pay for the expensive coffee at coffee bean or Starbucks. Also, the vanilla latte they charged me extra for, was a normal latte. Will not return again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go in here because of their huge selection of gelatos. However, I felt really unwelcomed the second I stepped into the shop. The guy behind the counter seemed annoyed every time I asked to sample their flavors. I'm sorry that I don't know 3/4 of the flavors are and don't wanna waste $6 for one scoop of gelato that I might regret. I ended up getting the guava and pineapple gelato. I wouldn't even call it gelato because it wasn't the slightest creamy and tasted more like stop and shop sorbet. I've definitely had better gelato for a way better price. There are many other places on the strip, so I suggest going to other gelato shops."}
{"text":"So many gelato flavors and so little time!

To cool off from the outside scorching dry heat, we decided on sweet gelatos in the Palazzo. Yes, Expressamente Lily offer more selection such as coffee drinks, crepes, breakfast sammies but we went straight for the kill on the gelatos.

I can't remember what my friend got in turns of favor but I know she like it a lot. I got my favorite flavor of Pistachios and love tonguing it like a lizzard or french kissing. IT was that GOOD!  The prices was fair for a couple of scoops.

We brave back outside and didn't mind the sun melting our gelato into our hands because we were too busy in our conversation and making out with our gelatos. 

Recommended for a sweet & cool treat.  This place will make you a fan, too!"}
{"text":"Super yummy (as always) Illy coffee! 

If you are staying in The Venetian or here it's a convenient location and they also have fresh made desserts. The gelato looks sooo good and next time I go here I will def try a bite! 

My soy iced Mocha was a perfect blend. Not too sweet and not bitter. 

If you are familiar with Illy coffee then this location is perfect for you. 

As always...it's priced about a dollar higher due to it being located inside a casino."}
{"text":"A lot of people here were talking about the affogatos, so I decided to get one here with two scoops of stracciatella gelato. Everything tasted good, and the price for it wasn't too bad.

The employee however, was a little cold, therefore I'm taking one star away."}
{"text":"Incredible 54 flavors of artisan made gelato & sorbeto. Highly recommend their Blood Orange and Grapefruit combo for citrus lovers. Their flavors pack a punch of flavor, and those citrus flavors were oh so refreshing! They're open late - close at 1AM - so for those roaming near the strip with gelato cravings... this should be your go to spot! It is quite pricey though, ended up costing $20 for a two scoop cone and Affogato! Located inside Palazzo Hotel."}
{"text":"Good tasting crepe. My girlfriend and I got the mixed berry crepe as a morning treat and the jam & berry combo was delicious. Not overly too sweet. Great tasting Illy coffee. Not worth the $3.50 small sized \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice. There's plenty of gelato choices, but we didn't get to try any."}
{"text":"Review is for gelato only. 

$8 (after tip) for two scoops. Gelato was marginal: poor texture, ice crystals, and passable flavor. Would be fine for a $2 scoop, but for this price I should be getting something better than a grocery store freezer case, not something worse."}
{"text":"The food is ok nor more then that,and the coffee is good , but the SERVICE IS SO BAD that ill never repeat that mistake!
After you talk with the manager here you understand why all the employees don't give a SH.. About your requests.
 Bad name for illy brand."}
{"text":"I love the set up of this location. 2nd floor of Yorkdale's new food court.   The indoor patio area is very inviting.  The seating arrangement and display of all the sweets are tempting.  a very friendly serving staff.  Maybe it was because the manager and owner were casually glancing over its staff.  It's definitely a place to put your feet up and relax from a day of shopping.  I could only imagine how busy it was during this past holiday season."}
{"text":"Are you serious? $5.50 for ONE scoop of gelato? And then $7.50 for TWO scoops? Holy!!! This has GOT to be expensive. I guess they get a free pass since it is located inside the Palazzo but still! They have tons of flavors ranging from lychee to guava to passionfruit, to tiramisu, etcetc. 

Come here if you absolutely NEED a gelato fix but if you can wait it out, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"LOVE at first site. I was walking toward the blackjack tables inside the Palazzo when  the beautiful, vibrant colored gelato caught my attention. There were sooooo many different flavors. I was so excited because I have a huge obsession with anything creamy and frozen. 

The guy serving me was really nice and patient with my indecisiveness. But after sampling about 7 different flavors, I settled on mango. Mmmm so refreshing. A tad bit tangy and just enough sweetness. It was $5 something for the 1 scoop and was worth every penny. I walked away with the cup of gelato in my hands, smiling like a lunatic. At that point, nothing else mattered. Blackjack tables? whatevs."}
{"text":"Always great food and service when I go there. I love their lattes and treat myself to a dessert once in a while. Haven't had their sandwiches so I can't say. It's a bit pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Viva espresso macchiato.  I read a few reviews.  EVERYONE!  This is a coffee place first and a very good one.  Sure they have other stuff, and I bet it is fine but there are a ton of places to get ice cream.  Get an espresso I liked the espresso macchiato.  The flavors are amazing.  If you like Coffee you will be happy.  Oh and hurry up We are waiting for more!"}
{"text":"It's quite overpriced, even for gelato and vegas, 5.50 for one scoop? I'd suggest you make it a cone, they give you more. The flavors were okay, nothing too spectacular. The pistachio gelato wasn't very good. I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Unfortunatelly i didn't get a coffee... wasn't feeling up to the caffine... but my coffee loving friend who likes Illy was happy to be there with a cup of chilled latte in hand... I had a crossiant sandwich was was not bad (but nothing fancy)... The gelato was good. The line was long."}
{"text":"I walked by once.  I walked by twice.  But on that fateful third pass, my feet turned in as if of their own volition to this location located between the Venetian and Palazzo hotels.

Rainbow colors of gelato greeted me.  My ice cream parched system, cried \"Yes, Yes!\"  And suddenly I found myself with 2 scoops of savory, coconut gelato in a small cup in my hand and the soft creamy coolness sliding down my throat.

Expensive?  Sure . . .everything at the Venetian is.  But for this one moment . . . . .ice cream in hand, that I took to savor on the deck of the pool, it was worth it.  Even if it meant more time on the treadmill in the morning!"}
{"text":"delicious gelato, but pricey! They offer several sugar free options!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot to enjoy an ice cream or a coffee while u wait for the gondola ride!
Ask for Omar he is the best making caffe latte!"}
{"text":"We got the espresso and mint chocolate gelato, they both are tasty and sweet, service is fast and place is very cute, they have over 30 different selections."}
{"text":"Second time here and happy
I came back. Their double espresso is to die for. They sure know what they are doing here. And their gelato rocks too!"}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to stay in this hotel or be at a conference, this is the best spot to jump in and grab a coffee and quick grub.  Meaning personal pizza or wrap/sandwich to do.  They do have these incredible deserts and nibbles that are delicious.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is due to their prices.  Ouch!

I've had their gelato as well, and their plus is they have every possible flavor imaginable. 

So take a break from gambling, but down your phone and have a sip and a bite!"}
{"text":"This is a refreshing change from your small quick dining options while in Vegas. You're usually either stuck with the run of the mill 24 hour hotel lobby diner, a subpar casual dining experience, mall food or gift shop snacks. Also, if you don't want Starbucks, or maybe you can't stomach another vodka redbull amidst all the casino funk, wander over here and have an affogato or any of the other espresso treats. You can keep going, and the precious caffeine will subdue your eventual onset of a hangover just a few additional hours.

It's Vegas, everything is marked up, so get over it. 2 scoops of gelato will run you $8.08 (tons of flavors and very hard to pick just one), and lunch specials (paninis, salads, etc.) start around $15, I believe."}
{"text":"Pricey but good espresso and gelato.

Espressamente Illy is my go to place when I walk through Venetian and Palazzo and crave some caffeinated boost."}
{"text":"I have make a big downgrade. After trying it for the second time, I realized it just didn't taste as good as the first time. Maybe I was too drunk the first time to realize. haha

But yes, the gelato is just very sweet. TOO SWEET! And the price was absurb! One scoop was $4.50. That's just too expensive! And not worth the price."}
{"text":"So I am not big on coffee, but I got the two scoops of gelato with espresso poured over it.  Dangerously delicious."}
{"text":"Ice cream is so good...pretty close to really Italian one. But ... 8.50 dollars for two scoops...well..."}
{"text":"Very rude staff, while I ordered the lady barked at me: \"for here right!?!?\" I said no to go. They never asked what kind of bagel I wanted, and when my order was up they called out the wrong number, when I asked about it I got more attitude. $14 for coffee and a breakfast sandwich and the worst staff I've experienced  on my trip. I don't think I've ever given a bad review on Yelp but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Gelato reviews? No no no no no! ILLY MAKES COFFEE people! Take a look around, *this* is coffee heaven. They may also sell gelato, sandwiches, crepes, etc, but they are a coffee company. A damn good one. Savor the coffee, people.

I was just lured inside. It's so authentically Italian - the stainless, the shiny glass, the real panini, the gorgeous coffee equipment. It was like Italy. Why aren't these stores everywhere?! Please build one in Boston, please. I loved it here. If it were near my hotel I would have been there every day, twice a day. 

Illy coffee is sublime in it's subtle, strong, earthy, ie, Italian way. We ordered two coffee drinks, an affogato and a half and half something or other. Ok, one has gelato. I admit it. But, when is the last time you saw affogato on a cafe menu? I HAD to order it. It's a favorite and I'm in Vegas - it's all about excess for just four days. The other drink was great too. SO great, it was hard to drink them slowly, and savor them the way you are supposed to in a European cafe. Then again, Barney's is just around the corner, and that was calling."}
{"text":"I ordered their cafe late and it was delicious! I like that they have so many different authentic coffee drinks. Wish I was in the mood for gelato, because a lot of people seemed like they were really enjoying it. Great location. Very close to the Venetian, where I stayed. 

I like the decor, it has authentic feel to it. I definitely had to add some sugar to the late though, but I suppose a lot of people actually like the taste of the coffee. It's definitely pricey for a coffee place. It was about $14 total for 2 lates and 1 hot chocolate. 

Service was fast and they accommodated a ton of people eagerly waiting for Illy!"}
{"text":"This place really disappoints me now...they no longer have this great manager that seemed to keep the place going. The last few times I've been there my order was wrong, the staff isn't very friendly and then the man behind the counter just walked away after helping the people in front of me saying oh she will help you...waited another few minutes and finally someone acknowledged me. I almost felt I was give crappy service because I am Caucasian???? I really hope that is not the case! 
Suggestion: Get a good manager!!!"}
{"text":"Good Gelato... felt authentic.  The Affagato was only OK.  My wife enjoyed here crepe.  Prices were a bit high, but that's gelato for you."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee brand has it's own shop?  Sign me up!  After reading the descriptions of the beautifully crafted espresso drinks on the light board, I decided on the 'Half and Half'.  

Delicious!  It was like 2 drinks in one.  Bottom chocolatey half, then lift the straw a bit and get a rich espresso flavor.  Wife didn't care for it but I loved the contrast.    If I ever get lost or turned around in this area again, I'll definitely be coming back for my caffeine fix."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up b/c the affogato was simply luscious. Tried the stracciatella and hazelnut, both were excellent with illy espresso poured over.

As Janet P. noted (5/18), Espressamente offers an impressive selection of gelatos - two full counters worth."}
{"text":"Espressamente Illy is located in the mall area of The Palazzo Hotel. As you would expect the store is really nice looking. Nice decor. There aren't many seats though. I had a hazelnut gelato and my BF had one that tasted like eggnog. Both were pretty good. The hazelnut one was really good. The prices may be high but I am willing to pay extra for a good hazelnut gelato. It is so hard to find even a decent one. Be warned - the portions are very small here. Minus one star for not having a chocolate hazelnut/Nutella/Ferrero gelato. If you talk the talk you should walk the walk. This place charges enough so it should have all the best flavors. Minus another star for bad service. Usually, if you walk into a place, you get back what you give. My BF and I rarely get bad service but the drone behind the counter here was not taught to smile and/or be welcoming when he meets people when he was a child I guess haha! Plus, he motioned us over to the register with a rude hand gesture and some sort of grunt."}
{"text":"Friendly, great service and the drinks are awesome.

The service is very friendly and the boss is the friendliest. They serve you with a smile and are thorough with the order.

You can't go wrong with any of the food or drinks there, so experimenting is less frightening.

Although everything is great it's also very pricey. A fruit bowl(more of a cup) is $5 which is really steep for a few cuts of fresh fruits. Other than that it's a very professional establishment."}
{"text":"Expensive Gelato, but HUGE selection & very creamy & delicious. Excellent cappuccino's . Quick service. Excellent location . In-between the Palazzo & Venetian by the waterfall.HeathBar Crunch!!!! WOW!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife were staying at palazzo and wanted to get a coffee after lunch.  Went there and it wasn't very busy but the staff was not very friendly. Service was fast but we ordered a frappe and it was very bitter and not what we were expecting. The gelato looked good though."}
{"text":"stupid as I was - plan to try restaurants IN THE MORNING! IN LAS VEGAS!

of course none of my target restaurants is open and I was starving when I saw this spot.

Love the way they decorate this lovely place. The food are surprisingly good - maybe cos I was too hungry?

Didn't try the Gelato. 

Nice spot to enjoy a lovely breakfast before catch a flight."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in for a coffee today, after walking by a million times gazing...and drooling. It was a bit early for gelato or any candied apples, but I definitely like the selection they had. Service at the counter was friendly and fast.

Next time, I'll make sure I have time to lounge and drink my coffee, which many customers were doing that day. If you're down there by the Palazzo or Venetian, and you're looking for a change-up from the everyday coffee shops, and want to drool at some desserts (better yet, just eat one), then I'd recommend Espressament Illy :)"}
{"text":"I'm fairly one to rate a place like this low, and when I began this review I sincerely wanted to toss them a 2 star based on price alone, but after some consideration I upped the extra star and here is why.

This place gets full marks on being unique, sheik, and trendy. The also produce a quality cup of premium coffee that I would say is second to none. However, as I mentioned before the major deterrent for me here is price. You wanna talk pretentious prices? This place makes Starbucks look like a Coffee time! Two coffees and a small piece of cake came out to $20! 

I don't care how perfect my Americano was, how crisp and clean finishing it was and how it didn't need a pinch of sugar or milk in it. AND I don't care how unbelievable the chocolate cake sliver (not slice... sliver) was, $20 for 3 items without getting properly fed is redic!

I will say that if you're looking for a key date spot fella's this is a great one. It's classy, sophisticated and polished. Staff are nice and the location is great! But still, my god the price!!!

And just to try and sweeten the deal, the staff handed us a full box of canoli's as we were leaving stating that they would just go to waste any way... stop trying to buy my vote ha ha"}
{"text":"It was amazing expresso!!!  This place is located on the ground floor of the Canal Shoppes near the Palazzo.  The owner is super friendly and was so kind to customize my expresso the way I liked it, even though it isn't the \"traditional way\".  I read great reviews about it and it did not disappoint.  If you love coffee and are in Vegas, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"A little ritual I have is to stop by here for a coffee whenever I am at Yorkdale. No real complaints, but the price is a tad bit high for the quality of coffee and pastries served. Given the location, I guess this is to be expected."}
{"text":"I'm supposed to be cutting back on coffee this year, but:
#1: I'm not trying very hard
#2: it's no help when the bf asks if I want coffee every single time we pass by a coffee shop

We were strolling through the Palazzo in the early morning. He was in search of food and I had no idea why I got dragged along. He asked me if I wanted coffee, but I didn't go into the shop the first time around. I couldn't resist and came back later in the afternoon while he was STILL in his poker tournament (seriously, those things last FOREVER. I came back 5 hours later after eating at the Stratosphere and he STILL hadn't lost... UGH! But I digress.)

I wandered back to the shop while waiting for the bf to lose. The cappuccino gelato was pretty good, but the guava gelato was a little too sweet. It was something like $8.11 for both scoops. I'd probably come back to try the espresso and mocha gelato flavors the next time I'm at the Venetian :) Hopefully he asks again if I want coffee, and I'll be sure to say YES."}
{"text":"The ice-cream was ok! I got a caramel macaron and it was sooo bad!! I think it was in their fridge for years :("}
{"text":"I spent a lot of time at Espressamente Illy while at a conference for my company.  It is a great place to relax, catch your breath and escape the masses with a nice cup of coffee, crepes or a refreshing gelato!  I personally have always loved the Illy brand coffee and was thrilled to see this nice cafe here.  The espresso is rich and dark with a perfect layer of crema on top...yum.  The staff is pleasant and attentive.  Thank you Espressamente Illy for the wonderful reprieve during a busy week."}
{"text":"I usually go to Espressamente illy to get my capsule for my illy machine. As they have more variety at a reasonable price compare to Amazon.  I did try their cake here once or twice, the thing I remember is it is pricey but they were pretty good. You get what you pay for.  It is pretty much in line of other good Patisserie shops like Amadeus (which is my fave place to hit up haha) So I guess it is okay to treat yourself to some expensive cake once in a while.  I like this place because it remains me of Europe especially Italy where illy cafe is in most corners and not the junk we have here aka Nespresso.  illy is far superior and worth every penny more, I can't understand how people can drink Nespresso at all.  I will be back soon as I am running out of coffee capsules and might be tempted to try another of their cakes."}
{"text":"They have really good ice cream and coffee and crepes but there service is slow they act like they don't see you other then that nice quick place to get a quick snack or ice cream."}
{"text":"I think all the gelato served at Venetian and Palazzo are Cocolina because we went to four different places and they all served cocolina.  I got the lemon ice gelato here which started off really refreshing and ended up extremely sour but still good...  just couldn't finish it.  The gelato is really pricey but the same price at all the places.  They also serve crepes here and other desserts.... and obviously specialize in Illy coffees."}
{"text":"Loved the gelato

Seemed a bit overpriced but... it is Vegas and what isn't overpriced here."}
{"text":"I don't understand why so many people are saying this place is expensive, think about it we're in Vegas not only that you're at the Palazzo. The Palazzo is far from cheap so keep that in mind when you want to buy some gelato or anything else here. I came pretty late around 12 and they were still open so that's a plus. The employees probably could have been a little more friendly but at least they weren't rude. 

So I wanted some fruit and I had just came from Walgreens on the corner and they had some fruit cups that were about the same price as Illy. So I'm a sucker for gelato so I got that instead (grapefruit) and it was so refreshing. Illy also had some sandwiches and some other little snacks. I would probably come here again because it's open late and my gelato was very good."}
{"text":"I think this place is really sub par for the pricing.  If all you crave is a shot of espresso, then great, good stop.

They have a million and one gelato options including many sugar free and fruit options, but none of it is that good.  On a gelato scale it is maybe a 5/10.  

The crepes are not that great except for the nutella, and um how can nutella be bad on anything?  The crepes are cold, berries aren't fresh, etc.

Two single scoop cones that don't taste that great= even in vegas = RIP OFF"}
{"text":"Worst espresso ever!   Too hot, and flat taste.  Trap-type drink is sweet with no coffee flavor, like a milky sweet icee.    Starbucks tastes better than here.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"The perezident and i stopped by here because we were starving and hungover. Cool cafe that has fancy gelato and tiny little cups for your espresso. I think  We had the $13 ciabatta sandwich and 2 bottled waters , which was ok. Sitting is limited, so cut in line if you have to. other then that nothing really special going on over here, i guess will give it another try on our next visit.
-ciao bella -ciao pasta!"}
{"text":"After stuffing myself at Delmonico's at Venetian, we decided to walk it off at Palazzo. I have heard my friends rave about Illy's coffee, so while my party was lining up for gelatos, I asked about their coffees. 
\"What kind of coffee do you have? Ground or beans?\"
\"Errr.... hold on.\"
This guy went to another for help.
\"What was your question?\"
\"Do  you sell those coffee on display behind you? Are they instant or are they whole beans?\"
\"Well, it depends on what kind of coffee maker you have.\"
\"So they are whole coffee beans for brewing?\"
\"...........\"
\"Or are they instant?\"
\"It depends on what coffee maker you have.\"
I decided to change my question since I am not getting any answer.
\"What flavors do you have? \"
\"We have regular. What do you want?\"
I gave up after that. I want French roast, Italian roast, Sumatra, Ethiopia, Peabody, Kona, Blue Mountain, But why bother asking me when all you have is regular???? Do I have other choices? And why do I need a coffee maker if I am using instant granules? That is , if they even carry it. It was so frustrating. It's like asking this guy if I look good in my new dress, I canNOT get a straight answer out of him.
The gelatos were ok, For the same price, I'd rather go to the stand in Venetian or Jean Phillippe Patisserie at Bellagio."}
{"text":"I have a beautiful time at this coffee bar, the services, coffee, gelato and the atmosphere is amazing. 
See you next time at palazzo."}
{"text":"illy coffee has got to be, one of the best coffee out there. This location is conveniently located between the Palazzo and the Venetian   and open quite late.  I stayed at the Venetian and after having dinner at Tao, this illy was a fantastic place to end our evening.

They have a good amount of seating area so you can catch up with friends and family, or simply chill and savor and sip a cup of their excellent espresso. Best of all, they even sell Gelato ice cream and scrumptious desserts.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"When you see a cafe inside a high-end hotel and casino (Palazzo), you think, snobby customer service, and little portions.  not Espressamente illy.

The employees are always friendly when i walk in there and the service is super fast.  and thats why i always put some money in their tip jar or should I say tip vase.  I usually get the caesar salad because its the best i've tasted, not too much dressing, just enough croutons, and enough chicken breast to last me til the last bite.  i just wish it was a bit cheaper.  other than that the other items for lunch are good too. Like their pizzas, wraps, and sandwiches.

they also have an extensive selection of gelato, which i will try one of these days."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here today to grab a cup of coffee because we are staying at the palazzo. For being in such a nice hotel I am appalled at how terrible the customer service was and how horrible the coffee is. Illy is supposed to be the best Italian coffee but the barista had not the slightest clue what he was doing. I work in specialty coffee and know what a good shot of espresso is supposed to look like. Let me tell you it's not what I saw here. The shot was pulled in about 8 seconds and tasted like water: I paid 6$ for a small latte that was terrible and the cashier was completely rude. 

I suggest going to coffee bean around the corner. and palazzo should really re consider having this establishment in their hotel as it does not reflect the quality the palazzo is know for."}
{"text":"Good coffee, but it wasn't friendly. The place is poorly laid out, chaotic, understaffed, slow, dirty, with very limited seating."}
{"text":"When I saw this place while walking between Palazzo and Venetian, it looked good. So I decided to try it on the day we leave on Sat 5/25. I bought two denishes and a slice of carrot cake. They were aweful. Basically they were not made the day. I don't know how long they have been on display, but the denises are hard and the carrot cake has a taste of fat which has been few days after they were made. I don't this this place belongs to Palazzo."}
{"text":"This place is like a mad house on the weekend. There was a steady flow of customers and one had to fight for a spot to get seat. 
I used to buy Illy espresso before I upgraded to a proper espresso machine and a grinder. For a standardized product their espresso was decent though pricey but in remote locations it was next best thing to buying fresh roasted products. 
First off the prices for desserts are ridiculous for a cafe. All this would have been OK had the desserts been decent, nope not here. I didn't try a cappuccino though might come back for one later. I went for an affigato and my friend ordered coconut cake of sorts. 
Affigato was OK but the cake was just horrendous. Think some of the worse cake one can buy in a grocery store. No real fat just gelatinous ugliness, devoid of taste and texture. My friend's espresso drink didn't prompt a response so not sure it was anything to special.
2 stars."}
{"text":"Good location. Great espresso and lemonades. Haven't tried the pasties here yet, but they look great too! This is a go to for my boyfriend and I when we need caffeine and are at Yorkdale mall."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because my sister raved so much about it. But if I could give them 0 stars I would. Service was absolutely horrible and the workers were extremely RUDE! One worker did the charging and the other one kept trying to get us to pay extra for things without telling us. They obviously do not communicate with one another so why were they trying to play tag team? Either teach your employees how to communicate and have better attitudes or have each employee take care of their own customers to make sure things are done right. After screwing up our orders by trying to overcharge us ends up not putting our crepes to go when we specifically asked them to. All employees need to fix their attitude and find out what customer service is about. Although coffee was good, I will NOT be coming back nor recommending this place to anyone until they fix this. Cannot believe how rude they are. Smh"}
{"text":"Coffee was really rich and flavorful, although it comes in european size cups but hey its good it worth it.  Price is high for cup of good coffee but they have to pay the rent to the Palazzo. I recommend the Latte Vienne, a little sweet but so good.  We also order the salmon lox bagel which was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"They make quality specialty coffee and coffee related products. Nice seating area around cafe. As well as lovely treats to pair w the drinks. It is more expensive than most coffee shops but it is a nice spot to grab a nice coffee while shopping at yorkdale or for a quick, delicious, healthy snack during a shopping break."}
{"text":"So when my number was called one item was missing, a bagel. My lady friend asks \"what about the bagel, is it coming up?\" Rude lil man behind counter loudly says \"There is no bagel on your order!\" #2 rude guy says \"just give it to her,\" with some dumb smirk... Lady friend looks at receipt that's at our table and sees there is a bagel on the receipt. My lady friend with receipt in hand walks back to counter to advise the lil rude men that we are owed a bagel. She is ignored for minutes as this guy looks down not attending to my friend and calling out several order numbers. I basically had to yell at lil rude man and #2 rude man and ask them \"IS THE BAGEL READY FOR THIS ORDER YET????!!!!!\" And what do you know The bagel was done a minute later. 
These guys don't deserve jobs, they should be dropped in the middle of Death Valley with jacket, a straw and empty cup so they won't bother anyone else."}
{"text":"Geez, this place is expensive. $9 for two scoops of gelato. To be honest, you'll probably be better off with a pint of Talenti from the grocery store. 

The one pro is the variety of flavors. Good luck if you're indecisive. Pistachio was my favorite. 

Customer service was seriously lacking. No verbal interaction or smile besides \"$9.03.\" My friend didn't realize it was her turn to be helped until we noticed the employee cup-stacking with one hand for the longest time. Perhaps a \"may I help you?\" or even \"hi\" could have worked? Felt bad for the customer behind us because she was trying to make small talk but the employees weren't having it. 

Overall experience was pretty uncomfortable, weird, over-priced and average. No thanks."}
{"text":"It's got the perfect location between the Venetian and the Palazzo by the waterfall. It serves the best coffees and expressos and offers free Wifi if you need to sit and take a break from gambling or shopping. 
There offer a wide selection of pastries, gelato, and sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Really cute place!  Its a bit overpriced, but its nice to treat yourself to  scoop of gelato after losing some money at the Palazzo.. or win..whatever.  

The worker recommended the mango or grape fruit gelato.  Its expensive, but the single scoop goes a long way.  The chocolate croissant was yummy too!"}
{"text":"This cute little cafe looks very appealing, but is really meh. I've gotten the tea here, not the coffee, although if they do coffee right, Illy coffee is really good. The tea is fine. What is most disappointing is the desserts. They have always been mediocre at best, and I've always felt like I wasted money here. If you have good taste, you will likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wide variety, I had no idea where to begin. I wanted to sample almost every one of them and not get something that was of traditional flavors. They have so many flavors, with names that I have already forgotten. I sampled one and because I wanted to get out of there, I just got it. It reminded me a lot like cookies n cream. 

I know I love gelato but I guess at 7 bucks for single scoop, I'm just not that down with it. I like the wafer they top it off with, though. 

Honestly, I most likely will not waste my money here. There are other great places to get your gelato fix, ones that are topped on delish warm crepes for just a couple dollars more."}
{"text":"I love Illy coffee but I didn't care for the service or the outrageous prices at this joint. $4 for espresso and only filled up 1/4 of the cup... Basically a tablespoon of coffee. 
I've been here a few times now and seems it's worse each time. 
The gelato is also not anything special so I wouldn't recommend that either."}
{"text":"This place has every other gelato on the strip beat with it's selection and I dare anyone to try find a better place. I  had spent 4 days in Vegas doing nothing but eating, drinking and people watching and I had passed by the espresso place with the massive line many many times thinking, \"I'll come back to you.\" I finally did during my last day and decided on the crepes and espresso side of the counter instead of the gelato line. 

The 20+ flavors did a great job impressing me and obviously the 15 people in line in front of me so with a heavy heart, I decided on a strawberry/chocolate crepe and an aranciata. I'm not a huge crepe person because they tend to be slathered in chocolate and drowning in sugar which these were not thank goodness. They were crispy on the edges, warm and each bite had an even strawberry/chocolate/crepe ratio which made for a great dessert. I'd never had Illy desserts before but after today, they proved their handiwork with crepes are as good as their espressos."}
{"text":"After a very late Vegas night, this was the perfect spot to stop in for a drink the next morning. I am not even a coffee drinker but I love illy's taste and quality. I ordered a caffe latte and it was perfect. We also had the apple crepe and it was tasty but I am really dreaming about the coffee. The setup was bright and clean and the service was great. Makes me want to stay at the Palazzo again the next time I come just so I can walk down for a drink."}
{"text":"SHUT UP !!!! If you know great coffee, pastries, and the like this is the place for you. If you don't then stop griping about price, and lines and all the other BS. Shut Up , eat drink, and pay the price for quality. There now go and enjoy perfection on these items !!!!! Everything is of the highest quality served in a European way...either you get it or you dont. starbucks which should not exist anywhere withing 1500 miles of a place like this is down the street...go there for cheap and crappy. The others ( like us) thank you for the shorter line !!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing coffee bar!!!

 I don't think I've ever seen one so exquisite and traditional outside of Italy. Illy is great coffee to begin with but I love the sleek, modern look of it's interior and how they use a variety of traditional cups to serve their coffee in depending on what you order. 

Just like cocktails, coffee is supposed to come in the glass/cup/ mug that it's pertains to.

I will for sure come back every time I'm in Vegas. I absolutely loved it. 

Get the cappuccino Viennese, so tasty and creamy!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee but also very pricey 

We went at night and there was no line but I assume that it is probably busy in the morning.  They also have gelato!"}
{"text":"Illy coffee is by far the most incredible coffee to get your morning started. Especially after a late night out in Vegas. Highly recommend the frappe latte. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"There's nothing quite satisfying like a good gelato ice cream, especially if it's summer and 115 degrees outside. I recently came to Vegas during the July 4th weekend and our first order of business upon arrival was to drive to Palazzo for Illy ice cream at Espressamente. 

For Friday mid afternoon, the place was already packed and we waited 10 minutes in line. It's located inside the 1st level of Palazzo's shops, near the casino entrance. Specializing in European style coffee, pastries, made to order dessert crepes and Panini sandwiches, their delicious and beautiful window display of artisan crafted gelato is what attracted me to this charming eatery. 

With so many unique and luscious flavors to choose from (50+ flavors), it was difficult to decide. There friendly and helpful staff allowed us to sample some of their favorite and popular gelatos. We ended up getting a double scoop on chocolate waffle cone of pistachio, tiramisu and mango gelato. The gelatos were amazingly delicious and silky smooth. Although they were a bit pricey ($8 double scoop with chocolate waffle cone), it was definitely worth it. 

Recommend to anyone with a sweet tooth and love desserts. Remember you're in Vegas so splurge a little. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ok coffee due to the Illy beans and machines. Poor service. I asked for some seltzer water with my espresso, with an attitude. They didn't understand and gave regular water. For $4 espresso (single shot), hey should at least know how to serve espresso."}
{"text":"Their chai lattes are the bomb dot com but expensive. I mean, it's expected coming from Las Vegas and inside a luxurious hotel with a mall attached to it but shit, $7 a cup can buy me a box combo from raising cane's. The service was okay, it took them like 5 mins for them to acknowledge me while the line was growing behind me. 

Well whatever, it kept me warm while walking the strip and it was so good I came back a second time so it must be worth it somehow."}
{"text":"Espresso is just average, not sure if it's their maching or whether the beans were old but it had a burnt flavor that I didn't care for and I went on 3 different occasions.  Because it's right next to the main floor, it gets very crowded and feels more like a cattle car at times.  Still on the lookout for a great place to get my espresso fix in the morning at The Venetian."}
{"text":"Pretty decent cup of coffee or Latte or Espresso to be had.  Not the best I've had but decent enough to beat the alternatives."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place based on my one experience so I'll try to not be wordy.

-2 scoops of gelato ($7.50... $8.08 with tax)
-Flavor: stratiatella=so good, tiramisu=aite
-gelato is kinda melty... don't blame the heat, it was November and we were indoors.
-right near our elevators at the palazzo so we were able to run back up to enjoy our ice cream in our comfy beds, like it ought to be.

My 2 cents: I expect utter gelato perfection if I'm spending $8 and my gelato was all melty once I was done paying. Hrm... I'll probably be back if 1) I'm at the palazzo, or 2) craving gelato in that vicinity."}
{"text":"I enjoy Espressemente Illy thoroughly.....  IMHO it doesnt get better than this... I have had their espresso (on multiple occassions), normal roast coffee, pizza, panini's and gelato....   I have been impressed by the quality of their food and coffee.  My wife LOVES their Vanilla Latte's too.  if you are near The Palazzo, hit it up...."}
{"text":"What horrible service. I asked if they had dairy free ice cream and they said only the fruit flavored ones were. The vegan ice cream was apparently not dairy free so either they were false labeling the ice cream as vegan or the waitress did not understand what she was serving. I asked for a glass of water and she was resistant to give me one. Finally she told me the water was just tap water. I told her that was okay I still just wanted a glass of water. I was than told the water is not going to be any good. I said can I please just have the water. The gelato my girl friend had was icy not the usually creamy consistency of a good gelato shop. Over priced for the quality selection and service."}
{"text":"Love illy coffee. This café located between Palazzo & Venetian. Perfect location for shoppers who walked all day. You just want to sit down and have cappuccino. Excellent quality of illy coffee and other sweet stuffs. Beautiful interior. Friendly service."}
{"text":"If you want good coffee, then this is probably one of the best places for one on the Strip. They really know how to make a latte here, especially when you compare them to generic coffee shops like Starbucks. Their affogato (gelato + espresso) was also great, and although I have never heard of such a thing prior to my visit, I was glad i tried it. The gelato also tastes rich in flavor and creamy, but definitely not as good as Cafe Gelato at the Bellagio. The prices may be high, but it should be expected in an upscale Vegas hotel."}
{"text":"Way overpriced gelato, but it is so delicious! Make sure you try a couple before you choose one, but I fell head over heels with the Hazelnut! The taste was on point and I would certainly go back despite the one scoop for approximately $7.  I also got a chai tea latte that was overpriced and again simply delightful and certainly would be something that I would order again because it was made so well.  The prices are way more than I would normally spend, but the quality is A+.  The service was alright.
1-5 Scale - (5 being A+)
Quantity - 4
Quality - 5
Price - 3"}
{"text":"Girl shopping day with my buddy this afternoon. We passed by this cafe while taking the escalator to Yorkdale eatery court. A poster got our attention. 
Pls refer to my picture. :) 3 to 6 pm afternoon happy hour special $5.5 only includes a nice cappuccino or cafe latte with a signature pastries.  What a great deal to enjoy a nice environment !

Front staffs are helpful and cheerful. The staff is able to suggest what I wanted and my buddy asked for. We enjoyed the Italian cafe stop during shopping dun at Yorkdale Mall. 

We tried two different type of pastries : regular vs chocolate. Love it creamy and light . Chocolate is too sweet for us. Must try their coffee, with foam or not that's your choice.  The staff is attentive to our orders, accurately taken and made sure we got what we told and asked.  

Nice and enjoyable and affordable stop during happy hours in a busy stressed shopping from the crowd.  The magazine on the table make you feeling like living or having coffee in italy.  What a nice refreshment stop. The place is clean. However one star lost... because we got a dirty knife and we had to go back to the counter and got it replaced a new one for cutting pastries.  It is a shame the cutlery didn't get check before handing to the customers.... 

Overall, it is a comfortable coffee break in a busy shopping mall."}
{"text":"I went here twice in the same day.  First time I got an iced vanilla latte which was strong and very good. Plus I liked the cup it came in. For four bucks I think it was worth it.  The second time I got pistachio gelato. It was ok. Didn't really taste like pistachio. I would probably just stick to coffee if I ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Illy coffee is infamous and Espressamente serves it. The flavor of their coffee was really rich and tasted delightful. I definitely felt the caffeine kick in after a few minutes, as the drink was kind of strong, which isn't a bad thing at all!"}
{"text":"I ordered a strawberry banana crepe and a caramel macchiato for over $20. I received the wrong order of crepes. When I took it back, they said they were out of banana. Why they didn't tell me when I ordered, I don't know. I would've ordered something else. My drink tasted more like a watered down latte that was 1/2 foam for $8. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously, is this gelato made of gold? Because I can't remember the last time I paid $5.50 for a scoop of gelato. And it is good, but it ain't THAT good. 

Well....OKAY...I confess. Actually, it must be that good, because I have gone there EVERY DAY during meeting breaks for the last 3 days. So I take that last comment back. It's awesome. Mint chocolate chip in a cone. 

They have a TON of flavors, serving up Cocolini gelato like the Venetian but in the Illy environment with yummy coffee. Way more selection than the other locations though minimal on the seating.

So yeah. $5.50 a scoop. It's only $7.50 for 2 scoops. How bad is it that I succumbed a few days and got the biggie version along with a cone? Ahhh blessed 30 minute afternoon meeting break, feeding my gelato habit.

Espresso is fab too. Try the 'Espresso Shakerado'...it sounds odd, but it tastes oh, so good. The gym?? Yeah, I'll be reviewing that next."}
{"text":"Espresso was good. My moms drink didn't turn out that great tho and wanted them to remake it and the guy gave me some attitude and said something in Spanish that I take as being pretty rude. Uh ok won't come back."}
{"text":"In the words of Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler from Weekend Update, $6.75 for a small vanilla latte....really?  Really? 


(and please don't say \"This is Vegas\" or \"You must have never been to Italy.\"  I know it is Vegas and I've been to Italy and throughout Europe, but to pay that much for water, a coffee bean, and flavored syrup just seems wrong when you can get it better elsewhere, cheaper)"}
{"text":"This place is as AWFUL as ever. I have got to stop coming here! The people who work here are the lowest, most classless people on the planet. They are clearly prejudiced against anyone who isn't Hispanic like them. It was very evident when they went out of their way to take the order of the person in back of me even though I was next in line. I'm so sick of the reverse discrimination that has been going on here for years. Spare yourself the bad energy and hygiene that resides here and look for coffee elsewhere. Suggestion to management: Fire your lame staff and get some decent employees."}
{"text":"Excellent espresso, quick service, and an excellent assortment of gelato (although I did not take a taste).  The line gets ridiculous after eight a.m. but around 6 I was able to get in line and be waited on within a few minutes.  You can have your drinks for there or to go.  I ordered a double esprsso and it was piping hot with lots of crema.  It was perfect.  Anxiously awaiting the chance to go back and sample some gelato."}
{"text":"Great display and good service. Staff is friendly and patient when ur trying to decide. Ice cream was good as well."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try something from this place. My friend and I were craving something sweet after our dinner and came across this place. To be honest, I wish we didn't come here.

The staff were not welcoming at all. No smiles, no hellos. They didn't look too happy giving us samples of some flavors either. I ordered 2 scoops of gelato, which was $9. Jesus. Let me just rewind to what happened before I received my gelato. The associate that was supposed to take my order stood there shuffling some gelato cups on the counter, while waiting for me to order. No eye contact with me was made, so it would've been nice to let me know that you were supposed to take my order. He took the order of the lady behind me as well. Poor nice woman tried to make small talk joking about the price and how in Italy, gelato is so cheap. No laugh, smile, or acknowledgement from the associate whatsoever."}
{"text":"$5.50 for a bagel- that too stale! The smallest sized cappuccino with no size options- what a waste and bad name for illy."}
{"text":"The MOST original place in Vegas in my mind. Here's a list of everything I love about Espressamente:
Illy coffee - as good as it gets!
Fresh gelato in a zillion flavors - highly recommend the Mango gelato
The BEST chocolate croissant outside of France (and maybe a certain boulangerie in Seattle)..warmed to perfection!
The warm caprese panini, with a side of orange twist, olive and a cup of chips
The impressive array of espresso cups that merit looking at as you ponder over breakfast, lunch or dessert options at this delightful little pastisserie in the Palazzo"}
{"text":"Coffee is good (Bouchon's is better) but the crepes are horrible - cold and not very fresh. Save your calories and go to Bouchon!"}
{"text":"it's a bit overpriced. 
overpriced gelato ($6 for a single scoop). coffees ($6 for a cup of joe's).  drinks.

my friend got the hazelnut and i got the pistachio
the hazelnut was creamy and delicious, but the pistachio on the other hand wasn't AS good. :-("}
{"text":"Every time when we are in town we like to try something new. This time our kids made a choice for us.It is very family friendly place, with a great choice of ice cream! The ice cream was soooooo delicious and there was such a big choice of it, I was kind of lost which one I should get so!!!
We actually came here a few times during our stay because we wanted to try breakfast and lunch menu. And we were kind of on a rush each time. And you now how it is, you come with little kids you order and you try to get out as fast as possible because kids get bored really fast.
I want to mention and highlight that the service was excellent and very fast. The employees were very nice and helpful, they saw that we were with kids and tried to do everything that they could to serve the food right away. The food, I ordered crepes were delicious and both of my kids end up helping me finish my food even though they asked for omelets)))
This place serves omelets, salads, sandwiches, wraps, ice cream, some cakes)))mmm and great coffee) Which was so tasty that I was coming back to get some more)
Definitely we will back to Espressamente next time when we are in town!"}
{"text":"This is is Illy so coffee is great. The Moarocchino is really good. However, the sandwiches are overpriced. Still need to try the coffee floats."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving this 5 stars is because of the chocolate shake! Get it! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't this place is that confusing.  The way they fill orders (pay and then give your receipt to the person making your order) actually makes sense and is very authentically Italian (all Italian gelaterie do it this way).  

In any case, I didn't actually try the gelato but I did have the Illy coffee and that is enough for a four star rating.  It is good and strong and tasty.  I will continue to return here simply for the Illy caffe and, if I want something sweet, I would also definitely try the gelato."}
{"text":"Lots & lots of choices! So many to choose from! I love their huge selection of Ice Cream. I got the mango & lemon sorbet and loved every scoop.  Came with a little wafer which is very nice.  Of course it was over priced but what do you expect for Vegas?  It was also so conveniently in our hotel (Palazzo).  Wish I had known sooner that they also had crepes!"}
{"text":"The gelato tasted it old and the hispanic lady helping me had a sour face the whole time not very friendly"}
{"text":"I'm a VERY picky coffee drinker....I dislike Starbucks coffee now and it's just too bad that they have so many Starbucks on the stripe just like they do on every corner of San Francisco.  Which sucks!!  They should replace those Starbucks with Peet's.

Anyhow on with my review with Illy...I absoutly LOVE Illy coffee.  My all time favorite is the Affagato with Espresso gelato....YUMMY!!!  This is the spot to hit when in need for some caffeine :-)"}
{"text":"The gelato is excellent! There's a plethora of flavors to choose from with some sugar free choices as well. We shared coconut and mango and were delighted with how they tasted so rich and fruity. Even though their prices are a bit on the expensive side, their gelato is definitely the perfect treat to have while strolling through the Palazzo and the Venetian hotels."}
{"text":"Came in here for some ice cream. It wasn't bad but some were just too SWEET for my palette and pricey. But cant expect less from a location on the strip. Service was okay... pretty clean. Probably wont be coming here too often unless I happen to be nearby."}
{"text":"Came here to try the coffee and it was served it cute little illy cups. You have to ask them to serve it in the cups even if you say for here otherwise they put it in to go cups. Also got a crepe that was way too much. It was with Nutella filling, scoop of ice cream on top, and whip cream. Friend got a peanut butter cake which was delicious and moist, not dry!"}
{"text":"Came here both times since it's always in my path going back and forth from casino to hotel.  Both times, the workers were rude and trying to rush you.  

Had the crepe the first time, which was good.  But the real star here is the gelato, delicious!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon the Expressamente Illy between the Palazzo and the Venetian.  Illy coffee is always a win, but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the apple cinnamon crepe, strawberry/banana/nutella crape and the ham/bacon/avocado crepe.  The butterfinger and butter pecan gelatos were also good.  Pleasant and professional staff. They were experimenting with a new drink, and gave us a full size to sample.  We were fat and happy when we left.  Trip salvaged."}
{"text":"I ordered a cappuccino but received a latte. The only reason I gave the 4 stars is because it was actually well prepared. Good microfoam and a tasty shot. I also ordered a single shot of espresso which was full of flavor from Mr. Illy the Master. I recommend this place as the best place to get coffee in the Venetian. The pastries are very good."}
{"text":"I wanted it to be so good so bad. We had two lattes and they weren't great. Pretty pricey, almost $16, especially since we added soy milk for one. They tastes watered down, not very strong. What I like was that it wasn't sweet at all, since I never add sugar to coffee."}
{"text":"Very poor service, over charged on items, tip added to bill after I left 20% tip, coffee was $8, pastry was dry, waffle order took 15 mins with no line and was wrong, however they did refund.

The fruit cup was delightful- fresh."}
{"text":"A good place to take a break in busy Yorkdale. However, prices as expected are insane. Bought a small palm sized cake and specialty drink, and it came up to $13 ish.

Tried their flourless chocolatey cake (don't really care about the flourless part, more like they ran out of everything else that was chocolate flavoured). It was good! But very small. Drink was yummy.

It is a good place to take a breather and drink some coffee since the tables are often empty (compared to Dine on 3 foodcourt one level up)."}
{"text":"Great selection of gelato and you can also get a meal here if you choose to. Staff are nice and friendly. It is very conveniently located between the Palazzo and the Venetian."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for coffee after dinner at Cut.  This place is a modernized, Italian style cafe and there was an overwhelming amount of drinks, a beautiful display of pastries and gelato, and lots of seating areas.  I ordered a vanilla latte and my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino, so my review is solely for the coffee.  The barista was extremely friendly and accomodating to us as well.  Although it was a little pricey for coffee, Illy is a well-known coffee brand, and we definitely weren't disappointed with our drinks so it was well worth it."}
{"text":"After hours of hanging out at The Palazzo's Azure pool, i needed something cold and sweet so we stopped by Espressamente... Delicious! They also have crepes, paninis, coffee of course...but I will try these on my next trip to Vegs.

Must try flavors of gelato (I mean I guess everything right? hehe)

*Guava -- delishhhhhh
*Cappucino flavor - very very delishh
*Tiramisu
*Mint choc chip"}
{"text":"SERVICE: I wish I could have gotten the name of the man who helped me choose but he was so nice! He suggested the strawberry cheesecake and it was the best flavor out of them all! I wanted to get two flavors in a small but it wasn't allowed. He let me have both flavors anyways so of course I tipped! 

GELATO: like I said, it was pretty good! Not as smooth as other gelato I have had but still a nice little dessert to treat yourself with while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have a long history with the illy brand, before decent local roast became popular.
The unmistakable steel canister easily stands out from the rest in the coffee aisle.
Through illy, I made my first significant expenditure in kitchen machinery asset.
I call him \"baby blue\".

A global brand, international chain and it fits quite well in it's new Yorkdale home.
It's as good as I remember if not better than the other Airport illy's I've visited.
I happen to be at Espressamente illy through their opening period and could not resist.
Baristers wait at doorway to offer samplings of food/snacks but that was not for me.

I walk in and skip the line to look upon their backwall of gadgets and espresso cups.
It seems most customers are there for consumption and less on merchandise.
I browse for good 5 minutes without any interruption and slowly carefully examine.
Y1 machine is not my style and direction is getting too tassimo-like.   3.5'd

Anywho, I'm not there to rate merchandise nor food but the main attraction, COFFEE!
$4.00+ for my cup of cappuccino as much as it hit the spot, I thought slightly $$$.
Made perfectly and enjoyed relaxingly in such a trendy chic modern environment.
Wait-a-minute. I didn't get to enjoy that until I got my order, which they forgot.
I stood there waiting awhile, at least I got to see how confusing they were at the line.

I have out-grown illy canisters as a home brewer many many cups ago.
However I am more than happy to see this old aquaintence once again.
Brings back so many memories, however hyperactive it may be."}
{"text":"This cafe is okay, everything is pricey. A coffee can easily cost 3-4 bucks, a regular crepe is about 10 bucks. Everything taste alright, nothing special at all. It's another self-serve cafe on the strip. The tables and seats are usually pretty dirty with crumbs like nobody ever clean them. The only nice thing is its location with all the nice stores around."}
{"text":"I love illy coffee and affagato is always good ... But not too much to rave about here"}
{"text":"I LOVE their AFFOGATO!!!

A scoop of vanilla gelato and a shot of hot espresso.. YUMMY! It just goodness that melts in my mouth. I'd love to come here everyday if I could, but I make sure whenever im on the strip or at the Venetian that I stop by and get me one of these.. 

Their selection of gelato is also pretty good, I've had the most amazing pistachio gelato there.. yum!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Espressamente for some Gelato over the weekend. They have 54 flavors, ridiculous! That's almost like Baskin Robbins TIMES TWO! It was so hard to choose which one I wanted. I thought I'd have a lot of time to pick since the line was out the door, but it went by super fast. I ended up getting Pistachio. My parents got guava and Donald got hazelnut in a waffle cone. I enjoyed the Pistachio very much. The flavor was spot on; It was almost like eating a giant pistachio nut. The hazelnut was very rich, creamy, and flavorful. After taking turns eating the pistachio and hazelnut, I tried the guava and it was a little too tart for me, but it tasted exactly like guava should. Having gelato here was definitely a nice refreshment after only eating frozen yogurt for so long. The solid flavors really make my mouth tingle with delight. They also have lots of other goodies like pastries, crepes, sandwiches, and lots of coffee drinks if you don't want gelato."}
{"text":"I thought this was going to be bomb bc I enjoy the canned Illy, but it was Illright.

Look to spend about $5.50 on a small espresso drink.

Long lines but it goes fast."}
{"text":"Extensive gelato and coffee selection. They also have some breakfast and lunch options, as well as crapes that looked amazing from the display case. 
 
I got the Affogato (hot espresso lungo over two scoops of gelato). My gelato choices were chocolate and pistachio. I really enjoyed this treat, but how can you go wrong with combining coffee and gelato. 

This place is located at the connecting point of the Palazzo & Venetian, but part of the Palazzo side. 

Picture of the treat has been attached for your visual pleasures. 

Will be back again when in the Begas."}
{"text":"Good for a quick coffee run.  Service is awesome for the second floor coffee shop in the Palazzo.  Pastry selection is okay.  Better as an apothecary."}
{"text":"Had two espresso drinks and a crepe with Gelato (chocolate crepe with peanut butter gelato, awesome).  Everything was off the charts good. Great taste and great environment to just relax for a bit."}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee but their menu looked good. So my coffee stop turned into a lunch spot! Conveniently located inside the Venetian, clean and friendly. I had the Turkey avocado sandwich, chicken pesto crepe, and an ice latte. The turkey avocado is a classic, the side salad was super fresh, but the chips were way too salty. The crepe was surprisingly tasty too! But the iced latte was okay."}

I don't know how judge this place.  I've clicked back and forth between 3-stars then 4-stars then 3-stars then 4-stars over and over again.

SO WHAT?  HOW WAS IT?
There's no secret to this place. It's a high-priced, semi-exotic coffee, gelato, crepe, and panini shop.  It's just a branch of the Illy shops in Italy and the rest of Europe.  The difference of course is that even with the exchange rate, coffee in frickin' Milan doesn't cost as much as in the Palazzo location.

The sandwiches do sort of remind me of salami sandwiches that I'd get while travelling from Milan to Torino or Cervinia in Italy.  But none of them are really very good.  The gelato is the same.  All melt too quickly and there's less of a selection compared to Cocolini's.   And none of them really stand out.

THE CRUX IS THEIR COFFEE:
Speaking as someone that travels to Italy often, going to Espressamente Illy for coffee at the Palazzo is kinda like going to a McDonalds in Japan.  You start thinkin',  \"Who in got's name pays $8.99 for a gotdamned Royale with Cheese?\"  Then when you taste your burger, you find yourself goin', \"WTF?  This ain't no McDonald's Royale with Cheese.\"  And then you eat it anyway.  Because you spent $8.99 on it.

Coffee at Illy IN ITALY is really good pretty much across the board:  Smooth & lip-smacking tasty.  Italian coffee in general puts Starbucks' liquid burnt umber to shame.  Nothing beats having a cup of hot Italian coffee off the ridge of an untouched mountain of frost in the Italian Alps before you snowboard down it and cause an avalanche subsequently burying the rural village below and creating mass hysteria and mayhem.  Just like the Green Goblin.  Yeah.

But I digress.  This Palazzo shop doesn't represent Illy coffee well, I'm afraid.  I get the feeling that they don't change the coffee as frequently as they should because cups of coffee here frequently taste a little bitter and have a bit of an acidic aftertaste.  Very un-Illy like, IMO.

But on the other hand... it's the best coffee available.  I mean, you don't wanna go to Starbucks and their hideous Crappuccino, do you?  You'll be hard pressed to find a better cup elsewhere on the strip.  And every time I cross over from the Palazzo to the Venetian to play Blackjack, I get a cup to go.

CONCLUSION:
Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father.  That's the only secret insight I've got to share with you because Espressamente Illy has no secrets and is pretty much a \"what you see is what you get\" kind of place.  It's just a plain, ol' ordinary late night snack shop - not really at the same level of quality as its Italian brethren.   I come because it's on the way to my blackjack tables.  You'll probably come for some reasonably good coffee if you dread Starbucks... but that's it.

3-stars."}
{"text":"After our dinner at LAVO, we decided to go get some dessert at Espressamente Illy because of some of the reviews I saw from my fellow yelpers.  We were tempted with LAVO's dessert selections, but i kept insisting on trying this place out to my friend because of yelp... I have officially become a real yelper where my world revolves around reviews I have read and my bookmarks that I try to follow!!!

The place is definitely cute and bright.. nice decor.. very modern.. it is right in front of the Palazzo fountain where the mini shows are held at certain times.  We just in time beat the long line.. As for the gelato, I've had better.. We sample tasted few of the fruit flavors such as mango, lime, pineapple but it wasn't as sour as i wanted those flavors to be.

It was expensive though.. about $10 for the strawberry and nutella crepe with additional strawberry gelato ice cream on top.. It's okay it was good. A bit too strawberry jammey for me though inside of the crepe.  My friend had some pastry which was very light.  It balanced out the super sweet crepe i got.  I expected more out of this place and more variety in desserts/pastries so I was a bit disappointed.  We would of preferred staying at LAVO to eat desserts.

There was a little boy roaming around the venue though.. He was all by himself. We felt bad because he sat at the table next to us all alone.  He seemed very mature for his age, drinking his tea and eating his gelato.  The workers there were very hospitable to him.  I think his parents leave him alone too much to go off gambling... :( bad parents... all i wanted to do was to tell him to join us.. haha but if he was mature as he seemed.. he wouldn't of talked to strangers!!!!"}
{"text":"Um this is a five star yelp.  You might as well get it here since it's the same price it is everywhere in the casino.  They actually had espresso drinks I'd never seen before.  They should make more of these in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles & New York."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place. We would fly in from LA just to have their amazing sugar-free gelato! But guess what, they stopped serving sugar free gelato now!  Wtf Illy? What gives? No sugar free options at all... Not even one??? I recommended this place to so many people over the years, but never again.  So disappointed in you Illy..."}
{"text":"Their Gelato was airy and not really that great, most flavors were too sweet AND creamy while lacking in bold flavor

$6 plus for a single scoop?! they have tons of flavors but I wasn't impressed 
---mint chocolate chip: ehh just okay
---cappuccino: I usually like a good espresso flavor but this along with the Nutella coffee flavor were too sweet!

Meh just here for convenience when you're stuck in the hotel"}
{"text":"Well for those that know me, they would tell you that I never pass up the opportunity to have a cup of coffee. I have really come to love the selection here, they have a coffee for all occasions. Like for lunch I prefer a specially coffee with a fancy name, but for breakfast I like just a plain coffee. The lunch menu is a great one, the sandwiches are tasty and filling, plus there is a vast selection of drink to suit all tastes. 

The location is fantastic for lunch as there is a nice view overlooking the mall hallways, the renovations to the mall are great! I do recommend this place as will be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Located in the Shops at the Palazzo

Hands down the best gelato (or ice cream for that matter) that I have EVER had.  I don't care where I am staying on the strip I will make my way to this place to have sugar-free almond gelato.  While I am in line, I envy the crepe's that are being made and all of the coffee drinks.

This past weekend we went with some friends and I brought one of them here.  I bragged about it - and you know how when you brag about something then it has high expectations to meet and the person isn't impressed?  Well that DID NOT happen in this case, she was blown away!!!

She said, and I quote, \"Why did we have crepe's this morning, we could have come here.  Why did we eat dinner we could have just come here and got gelato\".  And I agree.  That one small cup of gelato is so intense with flavor that I don't need to eat anything else!!!  And Sugar Free too?!  This is what heaven is made of (I hope!)

One cup of gelato runs about $6 out the door but it's so rich and flavorful that it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome chai latte! Blows Starbucks's out of the water. White peach gelato and the pecan pie was very tasty too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but drinks suck. I got a $7 cappuccino that had about 1/4\" or less of foam on top. Thats clearly not a cappuccino. Nice atmosphere but the baristas have no clue or care of what they are doing. With that being said I still haven't had a good espresso drink in Vegas yet.."}
{"text":"Finally a place that can make a good espresso without the sourness and bitterness. The gelato was excellent also!"}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe with fresh crepes, gelato, sandwiches, pastries and delicious Illy coffee drinks. The \"Amore\" which is their version of an Irish Coffee (non-alcoholic) sent me into a sugar coma. Imagine amaretto at the bottom of the glass, then a shot of espresso and fresh whipped cream on top. Sip the espresso through the cream and you'll be so full that you won't want anything else.

But save room for some gelato too... or have an Affagato to satisfy your craving for both. It's 2 scoops of gelato with espresso poured over. Yummm...

It's a beautifully bright and cheery place. Do a little shopping at Barney's and then walk across the way to this place. You'll love it."}
{"text":"The place feels very Italian in its set up.  I enjoyed what I had here, but found a bit of frustration in the ordering process.

Went for breakfast and wanted to order a crepe. Crepes weren't available for another hour, although it didn't say that anywhere.  We also ordered a double espresso and a \"make it large\" macchiato.  I was told the macchiato would have to turn into a latte.  Fine. Just make it!  We also shared a bacon and egg bagel sandwich. Total bill was close to 16 bucks!

Our number is called and we have our drinks in paper cups!  I bristled at that; for 16 bucks, give me an effing glass, especially since I ordered it for here.  The girl says, \"I didn't charge you the 'here' fee.\"  What?!?! There's an extra fee! Where is that on the menu? And, frankly, I ordered it for here, give it to me for here. They did finally put our drinks into glasses. But damn, what a hassle!

On another day, we shared a nutella-banana crepe. It was yummy!

The set up of the place is good, as is the quality.  The service, however, needs to be augmented."}
{"text":"I like Illy coffee a lot and the quality of the coffee itself is ok. But $6 for a 12 oz beverage is just insanely overpriced. An \"Upgrade\" to 16 oz costs $1.85. Plus the staff is indifferent at best. Still, if you're staying at The Palazzo, this is your best option for a take-out coffee."}
{"text":"Most disorganized coffee shop I've been to. In line to order a cappuccino employee finished with person in front of me then says just a second then proceeds to go take ice cream orders from people who had gotten in line after me. Don't mind waiting if there is a system but not cool with waiting and then having employees cherry pick who to serve from random spots in line."}
{"text":"Horribly, nasty vile and those words are just for the bitch behind the counter. The gelato here is just disgusting.. after 2 bites it hit the trash. Also, VERY over priced.. over 8 bucks for 2 tastes.. chocolate looked awesome though tasted like it come from a powder.. sort of like frozen Ovaltine. Also tried the lemon.. it had that weird fake lemon taste.. pretty shop in a pretty hotel. Unforgettably its all window dressing."}
{"text":"Affogato! Yes. I needed that little kick and a seat by the waterfall fountain in the Palazzo. And the gelato was delicious - I chose stratciatella and chocolate. $8

They also make smoothies. Honey, you're getting PINEAPPLE right? I raised an eyebrow and smiled. It wasn't long before we went back to our hotel - and I had the energy after strolling the strip."}
{"text":"Their crepes here is unforgettable although they don't top it off with ice-cream and is worth 12$ I feel like you could get a better deal somewhere else. But it's a convenient location since it's right inside the plazzo"}
{"text":"Really fantastic gelato with lots of flavor options here. I got the bascio which was chocolate and hazelnut, sort of a frozen version of Nutella. This place is small with not a lot of options for seating, so it's more of a grab and go. Which is fine, since there is plenty to walk around and look at outside!"}
{"text":"You're in the Palazzo and you need that caffeine hit?

Nice space, crowded but you could do worse. Hopefully you can camped out a seat amongst the Euro tourists. Wifi is helpful."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan. And I absolutely love Illy coffee. I loved it when I visited Greece... It reminds me of my wonderful trip!

Service at this spot was pretty crappy. People in there didn't care that you came in and didn't even bother to acknowledge you... They pretty much ignored me until I walked all the way up to the counter and stood there looking at them. 

It's nice that it's located right by the \"Love\" sign so you can kind of sit around and people watch. My fiancee got the cappuccino and I got something called the \"amour\" that made me feel a little ill. It was some kind of Irish style coffee - but for some reason it was served lukewarm. I was expecting a hot coffee. And then it was piled to the brim with not whipped cream, but some kind of whipped... clotted cream? It was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Went here @10am on a Sunday.  Had waffles, omelettes, and sandwiches on the menu.  Tried to order an omelette and a waffle, \"sorry we don't sell those anymore, we stopped over a month ago\".  What the hell!  Why is it still on the menu?  Ordered out of convenience a breakfast sandwich and a muffin.  Muffin was about 3 days old and the sandwich had lunch meat on it.  Save your time and go around the corner to Starbucks."}
{"text":"I adore this place.
Such wonderful service, and such yummy foods! and ohmygoodness the sundae I had was to die for. MUST VISIT THIS PLACE, when you stay at The Palazzo. It is expensive, but damn it it's worth it. VERY WORTH IT."}
{"text":"The customer service isn't good, I asked about the snack  menu and the guy told me food court !! Really ! You don't want me to eat at the cafe !? 

I ordered a tuna salad which was really yummy ! 

Nice cafe, but it would be amazing if they hire people with good customer service."}
{"text":"Sooooo so delicious, crape with Nutella banana and strawberry and a delicious illy cappuccino. 
The extra scoop of ice cream was way too much and ask for only half the Normal amount of Nutella to reduce the overly sweetness of it."}
{"text":"Dear Palazzo's Illy,

       I do appreciate your variety of flavors of gelato and free sampling and lovely cashier personnel, but the old lettuce in your sandwiches must go. I can't believe how wilted and brown the lettuce in my turkey wrap was. It wasn't really edible because the bitterness from the lettuce overpowered everything else. Please keep up with quality control, I'll be back shortly to check up on your progress.

Thanks."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place looking for some coffee. I must say that I don't have complaints about the coffee. It is what you will find at most coffee places (average). The prices, however, are a lot higher ($7 for a latte). What is not average, however, is the service. It was horrible. There were two people behind the counter, both of them needing to pretend they liked being there. A lot of the prices are missing or they will display the price of the smallest portion and then ask you if you wanted a large. The girl behind the counter had a bad attitude. She got really bothered when I asked the price of something as if I was just supposed to get it and pay whatever."}
{"text":"I give it three stars, because while the gelato I had was delicious, it was really expensive (too expensive for what it was) Alas, it's Vegas, but still."}
{"text":"OH MY WORD! I paid a little more than $8 bucks for 2 scoops of ice cream. The ice cream was not that good. it was fine, but I've had much better from BEN AND JERRY'S. People. Come on. When I can buy better ice cream from a grocery store, please up your game. 

The only thing that made this trip worth it that the guys working the ice cream were super surly and I could almost pretend that I was in France. Oh wait, except I was supposed to be pretending I was in Italy. Yep, fail again. 

When you walk past this place, just keep right on walking unless you are dying to pay a lot of money for ice cream that isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Good, but not great.  I tried the mocha before hitting the car to the airport.  When in need of caffeine, Illy will do."}
{"text":"The coffee was delicious.  Small, but exactly the same size as every illy espresso I've ever had in Europe.

The crepe was under-cooked.  It tasted like batter.  It was chewy and yellow.  Even the chocolate and banana did little to make up for the under-done crepe.

The ice cream looked lovely, but I didn't have any.

I was quite displeased with the service.  The person at the counter put out the lunch paninis and salads, but would not sell one to my sister as it was 11:50 a.m. and they would not be selling them until Noon.  Um, but they were already prepared.  It was an odd experience.  The girl serving us didn't appear to know their menu at all.  

Customer service, when I'm spending $11 for a crappy crepe and a good cup of espresso, should be good.  And it wasn't."}
{"text":"A 4 of 5 ... but close to a 3 because of price. But then again, remember it is within a high-end resort. 

Espressamente Illy is the perfect light fare, coffee and crepe shop (and Itlalian ice cream - gelato) in the Venetian to Palazzo corridor. 

The lattes and cappuchinos are made very well. But for us, it was the crepes, specifically, it was the Strawberry with Banana crepe, and the Apple Cinnmon crepe ... mmm!

It's always nice to encounter a good tasting item that is new or original or different in taste.

We have yet to try the gelatos as an ordered item but we did have a sample spoon or two - good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I am craving ice cream before work (its located right downstairs from my place of employment). They have delicious heath bar and caramel gelato...plus their waffle cones are darn tasty. They are on the expensive side (what do you expect...its located in one of the nicer hotels on the Strip) but if you happen to work in the Venetian/Palazzo and show your ID card you get 50% off....even then its still pricey. So...if you see a tall red head in all black noshing on a double scoop in a waffle cone headed up the escalator you know its me :)"}
{"text":"Small cafe but great products. Clean and modern set up. Friendly staff. Little expensive but that's Vegas. A great quick stop for a caffeine fix!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Perhaps my taste buds changed over the years.  The half and half drink I always order just seemed WAY too sweet and the service is rude.  We came here on a Saturday night during the New years weekend and the place was crowded with at least 20 people in line.  There were about 5 people working that night and I can sense the tension amongst the workers.  Then again, who wouldn't be stressed out during a major holiday weekend?

After I got my drink, it was overly sweet and wanted more ice in it.  I asked the first guy behind the counter for more ice and he pointed towards the other female barista.  I walked over to her and she gave me this angry look.  She said she was busy and had to serve the other customers first.  I asked again after she was done serving that other customer and she argued why I need more ice in my cup.  I told her it's because the drink was too sweet and she argued back saying that's the how it should taste.   I asked her to just give me extra ice and she finally hands me a cup of ice.  

Yes I understand people working during the holidays are stressed out but why argue about a simple request such as extra ice?  It's not like I asked her to make my drink all over again.  All she had to do was hand me a cup of ice.  Done.  Simple.  

If a family of 4 orders drinks/gelato here, be prepared to spend close to $30.  It's not cheap but you get pretty good quality for what you pay.  However, I was quite disappointed with the service and how I can't have my drink the way I want it.  Less sweet."}
{"text":"Aside from Bouchon's brew, Illy's the spot for caffeine. At Illy, you'll find your lattes, mochas, and regular coffee. The prices are above average of what you'll find at a chain, but the drinks are good. I'd suggest sticking to the beverages and skipping the foods -- not the cafe's forte. 

Another weakness to note about this cafe is its service, and it's one thing that I dread whenever I come here. I get this feeling like I'm about to order my Caffe Latte from a Soup Nazi-esque barista. Exaggerations aside, don't expect warmth from the service here, but do expect decent beverages."}
{"text":"This IS the cafe at the Venetian/Palazzo for espresso and delicious treats.  True Italian coffee prepared in the Italian tradition.  Super friendly and fun staff.  The pasteries are oh so good.  Also, a huge, yummy selection of gelato.  Espressamente illy is a must visit!"}
{"text":"The person I was with just won some money from the casinos, so we decided to indulge in a little gelato. I got a scoop of chocolate hazelnut gelato. It was so rich and delicious! It tasted just like a Ferrero Rocher! I could eat this everyday! it's expensive though..."}
{"text":"I came here to get some dessert with friends. After sampling a few different flavors of gelato, I got the matcha flavored gelato which tasted so good! The only downside is the price. I don't think I can justify paying $7 for one scoop of ice cream again. 

They have a seating area which is nice so you can sit down and chat with friends over coffee/dessert. 

I probably wouldn't come back again just because of how pricy it is, but the gelato did taste very good though."}
{"text":"I love the European feel, their great espresso machines, and tasty espresso. The only con is their ridiculous prices, but while on vacation in Vegas espresso is a necessity!"}
{"text":"Very good to excellent espresso, excellent crepes (mixed berry please), meh prices ~$5.25 for a large Americano, and a little hard to get the crew away from the TV (okay, Mexico has a match in the World Cup...how much can I fault them?).  I would never make them a daily experience because of the premium prices, but as a treat?  I recommend them."}
{"text":"Was on the mood for something sweat and luckily came across this cafe. Service was fast and friendly. I ordered a passion fruit Gelato. It was delicious and reminded me of my favorite Gelato vendor on Corso in Rome. Delicious to the last bite."}
{"text":"Blah.

I expected better... much better.  After all, this \"Gourmet\" place is inside the Palazzo.  They charge WAY too much for their gelato, and extremely too much ($~5) for ONE chocolate dipped strawberry!  Sorry, ain't worth it.

Plus, my gelato had little pieces of ice in it... it's almost like the ice cream that you leave in your freezer for months, and when you finally get around to it, it got freezer burn with little ice crystals.

Sorry, love the atmosphere and all, but I expected much, much better from this place!"}
{"text":"Great cafe above the hustle and bustle of Yorkdale. Excellent coffee and fantastic deserts. Not sure what the reserved signs on the tables are doing in a mall coffee shop, but just move them and get on with life."}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas and were ready to shop, but we needed a little sustenance first.  We were looking at the Venetian/Palazzo map when an employee asked if we needed help.  We told her we were looking for something quick to eat and she directed us to Espressamente.

There was a good selection of food to choose from....crêpes, sandwiches, wraps, desserts and gelato.  I ended up getting the Italian club wrap( http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/rmfDHoAyYCOlM0ELJmur_g/l ) and a bottle of water.  The wrap was pretty big and very filling.  No desserts for any of us.  We had dinner a few hours later, so we didn't want to overdo it.  The gelato seemed to be a hit, though.  

My lunch came out to $12.92.  Not too bad considering it was Vegas.  It was definitely a good spot for a quick snack.  Next time I'll try the coffee and gelato."}
{"text":"I had the Vanilla Latte both days I was here and it is so much better than Starbucks.  It is more bold, flavorful and aromatic.  The flavor is richer and more intense.  I am in love.

They also have a nice selection of food and pastry items and they start serving gelato at 11:00 AM."}
{"text":"The biggest gelato bar I have ever seen. The shop has been revamped since the last time I visited. Looks very modern and stylish.

Love the board of coffee combination they have up. Intrigued by their Afagato (2 scoop of gelato w/ a shot of espresso) we ventured here after dinner for a treat. 

The cold and warm along with the sweet and bitter contrast is really something to experience. Coffee and gelato -- all my favorite in a cup. Perfect treat for me."}
{"text":"I went here today for something sweet for my co workers and I. The gelato here is amazing! I suggest trying it, however it will be pricey. $7 for a small cup. It was worth it. I tried the Spumoni, and the Mango flavor.  Ended up getting the Tiramisu, and my co worker got the Mango. A must try if you are going to the Palazzo. The staff is also super friendly and encourage you to try as many flavors as you want."}
{"text":"Only had the coffee... loved it. Better shots than Starbucks."}
{"text":"For years I had always thought the best gelato/ sorbet was found in the Bellagio Gelato near their swimming pool. Now I can say that this place has now won number one in my book for Strip sorbet. Located near the casinos in the Paulazzo, you usually have to wait in long lines but let me tell you it is worth it. The Prince of Taiwan is lactose intolerant so I only tried their sorbet. Got the mango and pineapple, and dear Buddha , it was as if I was eating the fruit, just softer and more cold. It was heaven on earth for me that day, and even all the big breasted cougars roaming the casinos looking for cubs could not detract me from having a love affair with my sorbet at this wonderful little gem."}
{"text":"So I came to this place because the Starbucks downstairs didn't have available seats for me to sit with my laptop and get some work done. So I wandered the mall and found this place. 

I ordered a pumpkin spice latte which was served in a tall glass rather than a mug. Therefore it was pretty hot to hold and drink. And then chose to sit in the corner so I could finish my work, and while getting cozy in my corner I noticed a tray of mugs and dishes lying flat on the table next to me. I thought a server would eventually pick it up and take it away but after sitting here for 30 mins, the mugs were still there. I really did not get a good impression from this place. They played some funky music though, so that was nice."}
{"text":"Caramel Macchiato  - AMAZING! I like getting stuff that is strong but doesn't taste too much like coffee ... and this was the perfect drink! I didn't have to add sugar or anything.. it was ready to drink... just how I like it!"}
{"text":"$6.75 for an one scoop ice cream cone.  It tastes ok.  It's a bit pricey but it's Vegas..."}
{"text":"I went here a couple times while staying at Palazzo. The first time was for breakfast. I got a berry crepe ($12/$13) and it was hot and fresh but had way too much chocolate inside. Next time I'll tell them to go easy. Recently, we went for dessert and got a double scoop of cheesecake gelato. It was good and I like how they put graham cracker crumbs in the ice cream, but it was also really rich. I only go here because it's convenient but it's also very overpriced."}
{"text":"Pricey coffee, but if you've read my past coffee shop reviews, anything else on the Strip is better than Starbucks.  They do have a good selection of gelato and desserts to go with your coffee and it's got a great location at the Palazzo right where the Living Garden is located.  So after you pick up your drink you can just sit down and enjoy it right in front of the waterfall.  It's a nice pit stop when you need some sugar to keep your motor running."}
{"text":"The perfect place to grab a light lunch or relax with a coffee and pastry after doing some shopping. I make sure to stop by whenever I'm at Yorkdale! 

I've tried a couple of the pastries here but my favourite is definitely the cannolis - crisp, buttery shells filled to the brim with deliciously creamy ricotta filling, yum. Most of their drinks are pretty good as well but if you can't decide what to get, go for the iced white mocha. You won't regret it!! Sandwiches are cute and yummy but relatively pricey and not particularly filling. 

Prices in general are fairly high here but not unexpectedly so for Yorkdale; I'd say most of the drinks and pastries (except maybe the macarons) are worth the premium pricing though."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the crepes from this place and visit this place often because of that, but within the last year it seems that care for their service and quality of their menu has declined.  

Mainly the people behind the counter make it a horrible experience.  There are a couple employees that provide great service, but the majority are rude."}
{"text":"This was a nice little surprise while waiting for the Blue Man Group.  The store is very clean, and showcases the gelato for easier selection.  There are quite a few choices available. They have some of the fruit ices as well, so there is something for everyone.

I got a scoop of pistachio which was flavorful and creamy. It's not a cold as regular ice cream, but that helped me avoid the dreaded brain freezes I usually get from cold things. I definitely enjoyed my scoop. 

Hint, if you're with a friend that you don't mind sharing with,  you can get two scoops in one cup for a lot cheaper versus each getting a scoop. 

For some tasty gelato goodness, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Nice little eastern Italian style coffee shop.  They arent quick and the pastries are just ok, but a fun little stand up bar to meet up with friends or read your phone."}
{"text":"Well, well, well... ILLY! This place is overrated for its gelato and under-rated for it's coffee! Afterall, it is ESPRESSAmente, meaning ESPRESSO, hello?! haha

Time and time again, I come and get a nice coffee here, sit down, people-watch, and I notice a ton of people who just come to get gelato! Boy they are missing out. 

Prices are a bit high, though.  They don't come in sizes, they are standard small 6-8 ounce drinks that range from $6-9. 

This espresso is so rich and delcious! Regular Cafe Au Late is simple and soothing. Have not tried the Affogato (Espresso with Gelato), simply because of the calories, but I'm sure it's great!

I always order the Cafe Amore which is infused with Irish Cream and gives it such an amazing flavor! The top half of the cup is the irish cream cold foam and the hot coffee is at the bottom, and when you take a sip and both mix: *ANGELS CHANTING*

Absolutely a great place for coffee"}

This is the 
Only way to experience real expresso,
You have to have a Giant 
$10,000 Car sized machine like they do here.

Starbucks & 99% of other places in 
America do not have these machines.

Highest ever Reccomendation.

{"text":"Gelato. Pastries, lite lunch fare and of course coffee. I had a chocolate pastry, my wife the gelato. It was good, not great I have to ding them for the hidden charge for enjoying my cappuccino in the store. They don't charge this if you get it in a to-go cup."}
{"text":"This place surely has gone down hill compared to the last time I've visited. Before, there used to be a line. 

While its located in one of the \"better\" hotels and it looks the part, the service is wack and quality is not there.

I really shouldn't be paying close to $10 for 2 scoop of icy, crystallized, gelato."}
{"text":"Having gone to a buffet earlier in the evening, I didn't want another meal after watching Jersey Boys, but I wanted something.  Gelato seemed perfect!

It's pricey (of course, this place is in The Palazzo) and the service is as unfriendly as it can be.  My goodness, how can they let cranky people serve something as magical as gelato?!

So, for $7.50 I had a scoop of GUAVA and a scoop of MANGO.  YUMMERS ALL AROUND!!!"}
{"text":"A very inviting dessert place inside the palazzo. They have ALOT of  
flavors. Many fruity flavors like papaya, green apple, raspberry...and
many milky flavors like caramel, hazelnut, chocolate, etc. The gelatos are the first thing that caught my attention but they also have crepes, sandwiches, cakes, teas and of course espresso!

But I only ended up getting gelato because it is my fave and weakness.
  
So..seriously the gelato there is really good all pretty sweet and  
tastes fresh.  I got a double scoop of stracciatella and spumoni. It is
one of  the best gelatos I've tasted (until the day I go to Italy).  The pistachio flavor tastes like a pistachio nut, it's the same exact flavor as if I were eating a bowl of cold pistachios..  Has real crushed pieces of pistachio. The chocolate chip is one of my all time favorite gelato flavors and espressamente's straciatella did not  disappoint! The spumoni is also something to rave about.

I am thinking of going back soon to try the crepes, they look delissh."}
{"text":"Goood caffeine kick for the morning. Organized cafe. No fuss and simple ordering. Perfect morning fix."}
{"text":"Pricey, but one of the best cappucinos I've had. The chocolate cake is great as well."}
{"text":"Overpriced coffee; I can get better coffee in Little Saigon for 1/3 of the price =)

Tourist trap so beware."}
{"text":"Great smoothie!! Great Espresso! Horrible horrible service!! The staff is rude and seems lost with what's going on!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Palazzo and walked by here multiple times, making my way to the strip through Venetian. This place kept catching my eye and once I found out they serve affogato, I knew I wanted one! This place is overpriced and expensive.. $10 for an affogato (espresso + vanilla gelato). They have a wide variety of flavors to choose from. I probably should've tried a few to get my money worth! 

The espresso was nothing special. Decent, but not worth the $10 spent. gelato was nothing special, but it was good in the espresso. Nicely balanced and shareable. I just don't think I would be coming back here based on their prices.."}
{"text":"whoohoohoo! i thought this place was great! I haven't had gelato like this since a trip to italy (and i have tried lots since)! pistachio, raspberry, hazelnut and lemon over the course of 2days and they all tasted great-very light and refreshing.
and for those of you who can't or don't eat sugar: they have a nice selection of sugar-free gelato, all without that weird sweetener taste!"}
{"text":"Loved my experience at Illy's. I sat here for a few hours to do some work after shopping on a weekday afternoon. There's plenty of seating, so it never got too busy contrary to the rest of the mall.

I originally ordered a medium salted caramel latte, but was informed that the happy hour combo could only come with a small and a choice of cannoli (I got chocolate chip). I think the worker forgot to mention that the flavour shot wouldn't be included either (or the salted caramel was very weak). Nevertheless, both my items were delicious, and I can't wait to come back to try more of their items."}
{"text":"When you're in Vegas during the Summer you have to find ways to cool off. One of our solutions was to enjoy gelato. Espressamente Illy is located in the Palazzo and after a walk on the strip we decided to make a stop before heading back to our room. 

What caught my attention was all of the flavors you can choose from. I definitely took advantage of the samples since I didn't know which one to choose. I ended up choosing the Spumoni gelato and sugar-free Mango sorbet. Weird combination, yes. I just couldn't decide between the two so I decided to get one scoop of each. I can't ever recall seeing Spumoni available at any other gelato locations. The Spumoni was true to taste and there was an even portion of flavors, there wasn't too much or too little of one flavor (flavors included pistachio, chocolate, and strawberry). The sugar-free Mango sorbet was refreshing. The Mango fruit was already sweet so having it sugar-free didn't make much of a difference in taste. The flavor I was looking for was Green tea and unfortunately Espressamente Illy did not have it. 

The good tasting gelato and sorbet does come with a price. Two small cups with two scoops of gelato/sorbet each came to about $16. 

The gelato/sorbet tasted like any others, nothing too specia. If I'm in the Palazzo again looking for something to cool me down I would consider coming back, but I won't be actively seeking to come back."}
{"text":"It's going to cost you more than you ever thought you would be willing to pay for ice cream/gelato, but this just may be the best you've ever tasted!

Yeah, it's like $12 bucks for a scoop of gelato.  You'll get over the price pretty quick when you bite into it....it's amazing!!  I always opt for the cappuccino flavor.

There are about a billion places on the strip to get your fix of cool treats, but Espressamente is definitely the best.  Great selection, fast service, and the tastiest gelato you will find!"}
{"text":"The only star I'm leaving is because the crepe was so good.... But the service.... HORRIBLE, came here twice, and they were twice arrogant and unfriendly, they should hire customer service people, businesses depends on customers but these baristas are the rudest I've ever met."}
{"text":"My review is based on the coffee only. I wandered into the Venetian and found this place one morning after hubby didn't really like his coffee from bouchon bakery. I had two coffees the one that's most memorable to me is a shot of espresso inside of a small glass of hot chocolate. It was so good. The hot chocolate was so creamy and chocolately, it gave the drink a great chocolate flavor while delivering a caffeine jolt I'm always happy with! I am impressed with their coffee creations at this little dessert, coffee & breakfast place."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in and wanted a coffee and a sweet on a Sunday afternoon and the service was very poor. The baristas were talking to each other in another language (not Spanish?) and were really cranky and didn't smile. The gelato was boring, though there were many choices. I chose stracciatella and it was the worst I've ever had. The lobby was dirty and not kept up and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Their Sugar-Free Gelato tasted as good as any sugar included ice cream that I was able to eat before I became diabetic.
The chocolate was very rich, creamy and I couldn't have eaten any more than their serving, (which doesn't look large, but considering the density and richness of their product is perfect). 

The coffee drinks were the same price as Starbucks and tasted much better."}
{"text":"holy smokes? 

yes i know it's vegas and it's in a nice hotel, but damn, do you need to charge 3.5 for an americano shot? that's like more than a 1 dollar minimum poker table. i'm not a high roller, can't really afford the price for a shot if i'm there for a week. 

the price definitely killed it for me.

good prime location, lots of business, but lack of service and killer price (lightened the load of my pocket)."}
{"text":"Saw 'affogato' on their menu, which was described as 2 scoops of gelato drowned in a shot of espresso. That sounded interesting so i decided to try it. Got 2 scoops of coffee gelato with it. Hehe

It was delicious. Sweet cold gelato with bitter warm espresso. Mmm. By the end of the cup, wat was left was a bitter sweet coffee smoothie. The coffee flavor was intense throughout. 

Also had their cappucino, which was nice and smooth. However, it tasted bland sincw the esspresso i was having was so intense. 

The only problem was their prices were quite expensive."}
{"text":"Gelato outstanding Latte was great 
Pastry was stale maybe it was the little woman serving it on Aug 8 2012 8:30am
Awful attitude"}
{"text":"Looking no further than Illy for coffee stepped in here for a caffeine break done Italian style. 
 
Having frequented Illy many times while shopping and looking for a pick me up in the Grand Canal shops I have never eaten here.

Today this changed I decided to try their crepes. I ordered the Au Chocolat style from the crepes menu, plus a cappuccino Viennese. It so fancy for added whip on the Cappuccino. I decided to dine in since I was in no rush today. The crepes were good, but not the greatest. The Cappuccino as always Illy delivers in the coffee department with shining stars. 

The crepes they put way too much chocolate in the crepes. Plus it is canned chocolate and not real. The crepes themselves were cooked very well. By themselves the crepes would of been much more enjoyable without the chocolate. Either way the whip cream did leave a nice presentation for the crepes when served.

The staff was very friendly and pleasant. They are up on all the coffee lingo and will aid in questions of what is in this coffee and such. They provide very fast service for the food too delivery to the customer.

The dining area is very comfortable and all the tables were clean. They have outlets for charging out mobile devices by the front door. The music that plays is very soothing and relaxing. 

Such a great place to enjoy a good espresso, but shame on the staff for putting mine in paper cup. As many reviews state it's a hit or miss if one gets glass for that fabulous coffee in. You might have to ask."}
{"text":"They really don't know how to do latte.  They run milk foaming for more than 2 mins.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of illy coffee. Their Americano ranks up there as one of my favorites.  Their Americano is strong, smooth, and doesn't have that bitter taste.  Bottom line...illy coffee is really good.  What I'm not a fan of is the high ticket price you're going to have to pay at Espressamente illy. A large Americano and a regular sized café latte w/soy milk cost us about $15 after tax.  I can get illy a lot cheaper anywhere else.  But I get it.  The prices are jacked up because it's on the strip.  Vegas Baby!!!

TIP:  I got my Ballers Yelp Badge checking into this place.  

2017 Yelp Review #67"}
{"text":"We dropped by here for an after dinner cafe.  I have been to Espressamente in Italy as well as here, and at the V.

I like the selection of cafes, sandwiches, crepes, macarons, desserts and gelato.  In addition, the Vegas locations are open until 1 am.  What I don't like are the prices.  A large cafe is $5, and it isn't that large.  Sandwiches are $10, crepes are $12, and the portions are not that large.

Nonetheless, you have to give Espressamente credit for its offerings which are quite extensive.  If there were one by my house, I would be a regular.  Plus, I love the color of the rainbow offerings w/ their gelato which I found to be very good on previous occasions."}
{"text":"It was almost $7 for their fruit cake gelato! I thought this was a super unique flavor. It had fruit chunks in it the way fruit cake does. I'm a sucker for unique flavors. Their gelato presentation isn't as great as some of their gelato competitors in the Venetian. There is some indoor tables but they are limited. They sell coffee and candied and caramel apples here as well. I tried their nutella flavor as well and thought it was way too sweet. Their tiramisu flavor was much better."}
{"text":"Eh, I guess if you have to, is how I feel about this place. We woke up late on our last day in Vegas and had a full day of activities planned (it was a family trip). We needed to grab something quick to eat so we could meet up with everyone. We got the sandwiches here and they were okay, nothing terrible, nothing great. I do appreciate that they are made to order instead of the ones that are displayed in the window case. They have a wide selection of coffee drinks which looked yummy and might be the best thing to get here. They also have a ton of different gelato flavors. Not the best gelato on the strip by any means, but tasty enough. A little too artificial tasting for me. Overall, not the best place to eat, but decent when you need something quick."}
{"text":"LOVED THE GELATO! I didn't have any coffee here, but I did have the gelato and let me tell you it - IT IS PRETTY DARN GOOD. 

I tried the Mixed Berries ( very sweet with lots of berry flavors, mostly raspberry), Mango ( it really tasted like mango!) and the white peach ( a little too bitter for my taste). 

The service was quick and efficient. There wasn't a whole lot of seating and it was dimly lit on the inside. 

I'd for sure come back to this place on my next adventure in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Yes, it's expensive and the prices are jacked up to take advantage of the tourists, but yes, the coffee is killer! As a Las Vegas local, I frequently make the trip down to the Strip just to get my macchiato fix. There's no other coffee quite as authentic as Illy. Since I can't afford to travel to Italy that often, shelling out $4 for an espresso doesn't seem so bad. They serve their coffee in REAL china cups which is important to me; I don't think coffee tastes as good in paper cups. And yes, you do have to pay an extra .50 cents for a \"real\" cup if you stay and drink in the restaurant. But that's okay, that's how it's done in Europe after all. The seating is very limited but there are several counters if you don't mind standing to slam your espresso. The gelato is decent too with several sugar-free flavors."}
{"text":"I have a love affair with good quality coffee and Illy is definitely my mistress.  

My husband and stayed at the Venetian, so every morning we had the privilege to walk to Expressamente Illy to grab a coffee.  It's a small Cafe located between the Venetian and Palazzo, right in front of the waterfall.  (Great people watching area). They have pastries and Gelato as well, but the star is the coffee!  Everything is freshly brewed to order.  The regular coffee is always a must.  Bold in flavor, but never leaves an aftertaste.  My other favorite is their hot mocha.  Espresso and milk mixed with rich chocolate.  So delicious.  My husband always gets a Cafe latte.  After trying almost everything on the menu, this was his winner.   

We've never had a problem with any of the staff being rude.  I'm not saying they were all smiles and would strike up a conversation with us.  But they patiently waited for our order and quickly got us in and out. 

Price wise, the coffee can be a little expensive.  With every place in Vegas though, it's going to be expensive!Suck it up and pay the money.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Walking by on my way to The Blue Man Group, we spotted this place.  \"Oh my, ice cream, I know what we're having for dinner.\"  After the show we walk over and it's not ice cream, but gelato.  Which is what exactly?  Watered-down, less-filling, not-as-good-as-ice-cream, frozen treat for twice the price.  They get three stars because my husband was happy-as-a-school-girl to have something cold and sweet to shove in his face.  I was not as impressed.  I had the mint chocolate chip and didn't even bother to finish it there was no flavor to it."}
{"text":"Mecca for espresso lovers, Vegas style. Located near the giant waterfall at the Palazzo, this place offers a wide array of gelato flavors, as well as creative espresso drinks that Illy is known for. I had the Affogato, which had espresso poured onto two scoops of your choice of gelato (I had cappuccino-flavor). My husband had the mint chip and spumoni gelato, which he really enjoyed.  The service was just fine. 

In short, our experience at Espressamente was molto bravo!"}
{"text":"Cafe is good but the food is terrible.  Don't get a pizza it's crap.  On par with digiorno.  25$ for a pizza and coffee is outrageous.  Pass this place by."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by to quickly grab a crepe and coffee. This place doesn't operate efficiently- they had 2 employees on the cash register of which only 1 accepted orders- not sure why the other one was there. The third employee was proving samples for gelato and also making crepes. The last employee was making the coffee orders. 

The coffee employee was so focused on making sure the orders were being picked up instead of calling out the order number and then proceeding with other orders. 

Our crepes took 20 minutes to make not to mention the long line that was waiting to put in their orders. 

The crepes really weren't all that however the affogato was good. 


This place was good, clean and cute BUT they need to improve their speed- very slow!!"}
{"text":"Well we stopped here for a quick breakfast bite. I ordered smoked salmon and cream cheese crepe and my husband got breakfast croissant. My crepe was absolutely delicious! My husbands croissant was cold and cheese wasn't even melted... So it's really I guess more of a crepe place and dessert"}
{"text":"Waiting for friends by the waterfall so that we could go to Tao... we kept seeing people leaving Espressament Illy with yummy looking gelato. My girlfriend and I decided to go back the next day and get some gelato goodness for ourselves! There's SO many to choose from it's kinda overwhelming lol! They serve other items as well, caramel and candied apples, smoothies, drinks, etc...

I got the chocolate and vanilla gelato (one scoop of each). The vanilla was good... the chocolate had a funky aftertaste! I dunno... maybe I'm just picky... BUT it came with a cute little cookie on top that said \"Ciao\"... super adorable! You know I had a picture of that on Facebook lol! PRICEY though... I paid $9 for my little 2 scoop gelato (plus I tipped $2)... I think I said this in all my reviews tho... it's VEGAS!"}
{"text":"\"Ciao Bella!!!\"  That's what me and my homegirls get every time we go to Espressamente Illy from the hot blonde guy.  Jeremy is my favorite Illy employee though bc he is so darned nice!  He always takes time to talk to me and has even introduced me to his wife.  I just love coming here and tipping the sh-t out of them.  The espresso and coffee drinks are out of this world- I mean seriously you'd think a unicorn spit in the drinks to make them so magical.  I frequent Illy at least once a week and it is the only place on the strip you should get coffee from if you are on the strip.  If you are staying at the Palazzo and Venetian and you are hung over this is your spot.  It is fairly pricey for coffee, pizzas, sandwiches, wraps and gelato or crepes, but this is Vegas and if you don't have money you shouldn't be in the Palazzo or Venetian anyways.  Just keeping it real for you.  I will never drink espresso or coffee from anywhere else when I am on the strip."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to express my joy that this place has opened. If you appreciate good coffee, then I strongly believe you will share this sentiment. For the coffee alone, this place is worth a visit, even if you try nothing else. 
I, however, DID happen to try both their caprese sandwich (buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes & genovese pesto on ciabatta, pressed) & their canneloni. Although I've had better elsewhere (not to mention the fact that you'd be hard pressed to screw up such a simple sandwich) I really enjoyed the freshness of the caprese sandwich. I've also had better cannelonis; the filling was great, the shell was not so much. 
That being said, the coffee is enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"It looks alot better than it tastes...

When I first saw this place.. I was in heaven..  It's great how they present everything..

They have alot of stuff there..  We tried a crepe with gelato.

The crepe was just OK.. for the price.. and my expectations based on the look of this place was...it was a letdown.  The gelato was OK as well.
This place isn't cheap. You're in the palazzo, and expected to pay top dollar.

The chocolate syrup used was mediocre.  I would go back to try something else though.. something HAS to be good.. right??"}
{"text":"Love Illy coffee!  Smoooooooooth!

Had the Strawberry Banana Smoothie - it was so good on a hot day!

Free WiFi available in the little restaurant."}
{"text":"3 stars for the gelato itself. (there were ice spots in the gelato)

2 stars for customer service

Went here looking for some gelato to cool down and didn't want to walk all over the strip looking for a place since we were already nearby. There are a good amount of flavors to choose from and based off the samples, they are all pretty good. However, I was thoroughly upset with the service. The first guy who greeted us said hello then disappeared, only for another man to help us with minimal energy. He barely spoke to us and never smiled. Then after ordering, he basically yelled the total to me and threw my change at me when I paid. Incredibly rude."}
{"text":"After a horrible meal at Pickle Barrel I had to get something sweet to cheer me up. 

Grabbed a caramel latte, gingerbread cappuccino and a slice of chocolate cake.

I gotta agree with Kris U. - The prices are high and the cake slice was almost like a sliver BUT I was very pleased with the outcome.

The drinks were $5.50 each and both had great flavour.

The chocolate cake was silky smooth and rich in flavour. Very comparable to a Godiva cheese cake or Lindt chocolate. Pricey at $6.50 a slice but worth it if you want a good slice of cake."}
{"text":"Pleasant spot to grab a coffee and a sweet treat. Great quality baked goods and ample seating"}
{"text":"not open until 1am.  
no crepes at 11:50 huge disappoontment
Lazy workers open but no service
dont go there NO service"}
{"text":"For the price, I expected better food and drinks. Coffees just alright, I make better espressos at home.."}
{"text":"AFFOGATO. Ohhhh man. Vanilla gelato + espresso. It doesn't get much better than that. It will surely make you smile inside and out. The perfect pick me up to get me ready for the drive home after two long nights in Vegas.

On a different note, their cappuccino cups are adorable beyond belief! This is as close as I can get to a real Italian cafe until I can actually travel there so I will probably return on my next Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee, tasty breakfast and lunch items, beautiful pastry, terrific gelato...customer service could be friendlier...I'm sure the staff is burnt out on tourists but they should reboot and try to get smiles on those faces and be friendly."}
{"text":"The affogato lived up to the hype. I got mine with hazelnut and caramel gelato, and it worked nicely against the bitterness of the espresso. It was around $6 for the affogato, so not bad when considering the place was inside the Palazzo. There are a ton of different gelato flavors, especially fruit-based ones, if you aren't into coffee."}
{"text":"I have extremely mixed feelings about this place.

Food: fanstatic selection of gelato and other cafe goodies!  I could spend countless trips tasting everything - the pear gelato was refreshing and super yummy.  5 Star

Prices: One two-scoop little cup set me back about $8 USD but I was on vacation so who cares, won't be doing this for a while.  3 Stars (especially in consideration that this was in the Palazzo)

Service:  I very seldom get offended but why would the cashier frown at me for trying to pay with cash (I am saving the establishment credit card fees), then roll her eyes at me when I asked for cup of water.  I had to approach a different cashier to get a spoon to eat my gelato!  Which garnered another eye rolling from the first cashier!  And not a single thank you from either - there were no other customers at that time.  0 Stars"}
{"text":"Hmm not my favorite place on the Strip. Service was pretty bad... Most of the workers had attitudes. The crepes were just alright, and coffee was decent. Not worth the price for sure but then again it is located inside the Venetian."}
{"text":"Stopped by for coffee after shoe shopping with my mum. It's relatively new and serves both drinks and treats. Pricing is okay - not expensive, but not cheap. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm at Yorkdale, I'll stop by should I need a pick me up.

Good for: espresso, desserts, sandwiches"}
{"text":"Gentlemen - if your girlfriend likes gelato and coffee, I would pretend like you knew about this place all along and take her here as you stroll through the Palazzo shops. Tell her to get the affogato - two scoops of gelato and coffee. She will love you for life once she tastes it.

I'm not saying that I knew about this drink/dessert. In fact, far from it - I don't even drink coffee. But, consider thanking me when you heed this advice on your indulgent foray in Las Vegas with your significant other."}
{"text":"This is a very conveniently located coffee shop in the shopping area between The Venetian and The Palazzo. You'll stumble upon it if you are walking by the area. My husband and I stopped in here for some coffee before going to a Cirque show. We're old so we were worried that we'd fall asleep at a 9:30 show. 

The shop is large and has a nice amount of seating. If the seating in the shop is full you could easily find a spot in the hall. They offer hot and cold coffee options, but also desserts, salads, and sandwiches. Everything is nicely displayed in the case so you can see what you are getting.

The employees didn't greet us when we came in or act friendly in any way. They did prepare our coffee without much of a wait though.

I went for a Vanilla Latte which was delicious. I really liked the taste of the coffee and the slight sweetness of the vanilla. My husband had an Iced Chocolate Mocha. He loved the flavor once he mixed up the puddle of chocolate at the bottom of the cup."}
{"text":"If you are an espresso snob, aficionado, lover, whatever then this is probably one of the best espressos i have had in America. It was perfect and I was sober. Thick, creamy, hot cup, sugar become one with the crema and not once could we see the black coffee underneath. Liquid gold."}
{"text":"We just stayed in Palazzo for 3 nights and this became our little go to spot for small treats and drinks.  I loved their gelato, especially the stracciatella.  Soooooo good in the chocolate dipped waffle cone.  My girls got crepes (berry and banana), frapes and other various coffee drinks that they seemed to enjoy.

Their breakfast menu was limited, so we went elsewhere for that, but overall a safe find for treats!"}
{"text":"This seems to be the creme de la creme of all cafe chains and this particular location differs from the one in downtown LA in that it serves gelato - which, to me, is equivalent to sex.

They promise to offer the most authentic Italian cafe experience outside of Italy: they charge extra if you're going to use their cups, just how it is in Italy (shit, if my mom and grandma was with me, they'd stuff those cup and saucers in their fake Louis V bags.........go to mama's house and you'll see a slew of plates from various restaurants).

I only had the affogato (amazing!) which is typically a scoop of vanilla gelato topped over an espresso. It blends perfectly together and it pumped me up  for a baby-making project, especially when I saw that dee-luscious guy perusing through reports and sipping on his latte, mmm! Caffeine takes over where Cialis fails (not that I need it anytime soon; for all my third-legged bunch who are uber caffeine-sensitive like myself, you know it hits that area well). The espresso was rich and had the right notes to complement the gelato; it's coffee-flavoured ice cream, basically, for all you Starbucks folk. In addition, they have crepes and even more lattes, more gelato flavours, and espressos which I'm sure are phenomenal.

As for the gelato, it tasted like any other I've had: soft with little to no air and is creamier than the creamiest creams, haha. I was so drained that day after attending a convention nearby and this was a perfect spot to unwind and recharge. 

Service could use a little fine-tuning but I don't really care as long as they scoop it up and it leaves a good impression in my mouth, mmm! The affogato, you guys need to try.

This is a new must-stop for my frequent Vegas travels. Come here!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly service?  I'm in complete agreement.  Gelato and crepes are two of the most delicious desserts around.  Why is the cashier so annoyed and only half-alive?  Bananas and chocolate with fluffy crepes.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Such a large selection of cute sweets! Cannoli and macarons!! A bit on the pricey side, but the staff were all really nice. Sometimes, you really just need a sugar fix and some coffee."}
{"text":"Once again I was trapped inside the Sands Convention Center working a convention. On the last day of the convention I decided to give myself a little gift of an affogato. This time I got the vanilla bean (heavenly by itself by the way) and the cappuccino flavored gelatos. 

It is pricey, but it is worth it. The gelatos are just amazing. They are not mediocre and believe me, even though you are paying jacked-up fancy strip property prices it is worth it!

The only thing is that service this go-round was once again lacking. The employees just don't seem that happy. Perhaps it is because the place gets super packed during conferences and the employees get over-worked... but still, wish they were a bit more happy, they are serving delicious treats after all!"}
{"text":"I heart Illy coffee already and now Espressamente Illy Cafe! Geez! Does life get any better than crepes, gelato, great espresso, and sandwiches?? 

I would pay their higher prices any day over stupid Starbucks! This place was so uber-cute and chic and everything was fresh and yummy! But, beware, your $20 can go fast here!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre coffee . Staff is unpleasant and not helpful . You can tell they don't know anything about coffee nor care . Got my order wrong twice and wanted me to pay extra for their mix up."}
{"text":"I was able to split a small into two flavors, the caramel was flavorless but the stracciatella was good, crunchy in each bite from the chocolate churned in the ice cream.  5 bucks is pricey but expected.  I returned the next day to get a cup of coffee, stood in front of three employees having a non work related conversation.  I waited five minutes then gave up and walked away.  As I went up the escalator I could see they were still talking at the counter.  Gelato was ok, service was not, can't speak to the coffee as I couldn't get any."}
{"text":"DROOL...I stayed in the Palazzo which means that everyday I walked by this place and had to get something.  The lemon ice thing is really good as well as their chocolate and vanilla.  For ice cream though, they are pricy."}
{"text":"Creamy and bursting with flavor!  The pistachio and mint chocolate chip flavors were my fave!  Cherry, not so good, but the lyche, watermelon, and pineapples tasted like the fruits itself!

Expensive, yes, but so is everything in Vegas."}
{"text":"My eyes could not stay away from this place everytime I passed it. Hence, I came here twice in one weekend. So many gelato flavors and drink options. If you're an espresso fan, I think you'll like this place just fine. 

The service here is a bit of an issue - they are slow and a bit aloof. But that's forgiveable considering it's just an order then sit place, not a big deal. It's also very warm in here, uncomfortably so. Don't know if it was just an off weekend....

It's a cute place to have a chat and eat some tasty desserts. I enjoyed their gelato and strawberry shake. Yummm. I am not sure how their savory foods or pastries are but they at least LOOKED nice. The espresso drinks are strong (duh), and tasted better than Starbucks (yeah I said it!).

You can buy Illy merchandise here too - limited edition espresso cups, coffee, gift sets, etc."}
{"text":"Very nice dessert shop inside the palazzo. Mainly gelato and crepes and other pastries. I had the peanut butter gelato and it was delicious. Very expensive though... About 6.25 for 1 scoop."}
{"text":"First off, the gelato was what really caught my eye from outside. I also captured the illy sign next to the main title. I love illy which is why I wanted to come try this place out.

As I walked in, the cafe was filled with coffee aroma with gelato into it. The variety of coffee was unique too! They had specialty espresso drinks. The espresso was not too strong because it had hot choco syrup at the very end which made my drink soo good! My gf had the spumoni gelato on a waffle cone which was soo delish! The workers didn't seem too happy. They looked like it they were ready to leave the place in a hurry. The lady was irritated and they didn't even stare you in the eye.

I would definitely come back for another drink...if I carry more money LOL"}
{"text":"The gelato was delish! I had straciatella one night as a treat and went back again for a treat and got double scoops of tiramisu and cappuccino all of which were amazing!! Such a yum treat after a long work day! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The best coffee on the strip! I will actually go out of my way to have a delicious Latte from Illy. I wish there was one in LA."}
{"text":"Great coffee and espresso like you get at the cafe on the bridge on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy (I have been there).

Good service and nice surroundings.
I wish all the Starbucks in the US would be taken over by Illy."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a caffeinated beverage and I saw the sign outside for the \"Afternoon Snack\" and when I asked the girl about it, she told me that it had ended...an hour ago.  :(

(Pet Peeve:  If deal is over, PLEASE REMOVE THE SIGN.  There is nothing worse than knowing that you missed a \"deal\".  Not to mention that it's somewhat misleading.)

Anyway, I prodded some more as to what I missed, how much it was, hint, hint, nudge, nudge.  Girl who took my order wasn't so sure about the price (~$6.50), but she told me that it included either a Cap/Latté + a cannoli.  JUST. SHOOT. ME. NOW.

It was around 7pm and there were a whack loada cannolis left.  How difficult would it have been to ask the manager if they could extend the deal for me to make some more money before closing time??!!

To me, it's a no-brainer, win-win situation.  Illy makes more money and I walk away a happy, fatter customer."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh and always taste good !
The manager and his team here doing a great job! And of course the coffee is super good here. Can eat here breakfast lunch and dinner !!"}
{"text":"This review is based on their gelato which was only A-OK.

So I was craving dessert like crazy in Vegas and especially something cold and creamy with it being triple digit weather there at the time. I initially wanted to check out Serendipity 3 and their frozen hot chocolate after I had been reminded of it by my friend Sally. But that never happened as Camellia C. said she preferred to go to New York for the original Serendipity.

Anyway, walking around the Palazzo to kill time after a big brunch at Bouchon had me fiending for gelato to cool down.  

At Espressamente Illy, two scoops of gelato will cost you around $7 and with that you'd think you'd get some pretty good gelato. It wasn't the bad but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Maybe it was because the Spumoni scoop was mixing with the Mango scoop to create an not so flavorful mixture of tastes. I still cleaned those bad boys out as the scoops are definitely on the small side. Which totally sucks when you just overloaded on the Rio Carnival Buffet's gelato bar the previous night. 

I wasn't going to leave Vegas without checking out at least one dessert place but I ultimately left unfulfilled and will have to come back to scour out different places for gelato/ice cream next time."}
{"text":"Espressente seriously TRUMPS Starbucks!! My favorite girl there, Jennifer, hands down make THE BEST latte I've ever had. As soon as she sees me, she starts making my coffee! I rave about her to all of my coworkers and clients who come into my store & I will continue to come back daily as long as the same excellent service she and Guillermo is carried on! These two & Jennifer's lattes are by far the best way to start & finish every one of my work days!!"}
{"text":"The ice cream sucks. I ordered two scoops: strawberry cream and tiramisu. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Food service is slow and limited siting space.  Cream of brocc soup was very good, but the \"pizza\" was barely ok.  I would give this place @ best 3 stars, but then on my way back from shopping; stopped and had the \"affogato\".  I went with hazelnut (my fav flavor) and it was topped off with espresso. Holy XXXX! What a great combo.  They have a ton of great espresso drinks so stop by and enjoy. A word of caution though, this is NOT Starbucks.  They do not have Frappacionos,etc.  Saw a couple not happy with their drinks (they complained @ the counter) as they confused Starbucks' \"style\" and \"prep\" with authentic espresso drinks."}
{"text":"Friendly staff cannot save this place for f'n up illy coffee.  Sure they use the same illy beans my local cafe uses, but the way it's brewed here makes it taste totally weak in comparison.  I think it was like $7 for my latte that wasn't strong and didn't have the rich flavor i associate with illy coffee.  i'll stick with Coffee Bean when i'm staying at Palazzo."}
{"text":"I've never had a crepe.  This was a shock and had to be remedied quickly.  The Palazzo/Venetian Shops were one of many stops during our Vegas adventure and a run through the rain made us hungry again.

This is dessert heaven.  Crepes, gelato, and espresso.  Yum!  We ordered the mixed berry and stood by to watch as it was made. The crepe is a thin delicious pancake drizzled with hot chocolate and topped with raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries.  It was a lot of chocolate even though I love chocolate but overall a yummy delicious treat."}
{"text":"Ordered a strawberries and chocolate crepe.  Crepe was not the best tasting.  Had strawberry \"puree\" in it as well as nutella.  The nutella was a nice hazelnut flavor, but that \"puree\" was effen disgusting.  Tasted like the filling for a Pillsbury Toaster Strudel...that mixed with the nutella was AWFUL.

Will never go back for that.  I might return to try some gelato or one of the many coffee drinks."}
{"text":"The crepe was pretty good. We ordered the strawberry -banana crepe it was $13.95 instead of the $12.50 posted on the sign. The cashier failed to mention that it was more money. I also order a cup of coffee and asked her if there was free refills if we ate there and she said, \"yes\" but when I went back up to ask for my refill they said it would cost $1.00. No big deal but it's not cool to tell the customer one thing and then charge them."}
{"text":"It's a cute modern coffee/dessert shop located inside of the Palazzo on the way to the Venetian. I'm not a fan of the gelato. I ordered pistachio and tasted a little artificial. Almost plastic. I heard the passion fruit gelato was great though. So my 4 stars is definitely not for the gelato. I had a small cup of cafe treistino (triestano?) and it was awesome. I opted to drop a packet of brown sugar in after the first couple of sips, but it was good without the hint of the sweetness. I could drink a cup everyday and it smelled so good. The love the decor. It's bright, hip, modern, chic, but not intimidating all rolled into one. I wished there was a place like this near work. I would venture over everyday for my espresso fixed even though I don't have a need to consume caffeine every morning."}
{"text":"Love that they have a huge selection of flavors.  Their gelato and sorbetto is pretty tasty as well but can be icy sometimes.  Really depends on your luck of the draw.  I think I would appreciate this place more if things were a little cheaper.  Overall, okay place for gelato considering you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Here for a convention just eating my yummy turkey wrap ;) it did take a bit of time to get it but worth the wait ;) nice little deli atmosphere great portion sizes!"}
{"text":"You can't get better than this place if you want real Italian cafe food and coffee. This shop is run by a wonderful Italian family who lives, breathes, and eats coffee. The reason why prices here and elsewhere on the strip are high is because rents are extremely high. I mean insanely high. It isn't because the shop owners are greedy. Bottom line, if you want a delicious coffee and dessert, go here."}
{"text":"Star is for the coffee only. Staff was rude and impatient. They all need customer service training. The strawberry and cheese croissant tasted like 5 day old bread. No joke. Very hard to eat and the croissant was heated up. I don't mind paying high resort prices but this was not worth it."}
{"text":"Very crowded. They have fancy coffee drinks that tasted ok. The crepe was ok but not worth the price. There was barely any nutella on it. I gave it high stars because the gelato was just terrific. I had hazelnut chocolate and i believe oreo. Overall i would go there just for the hazelnut chocolate gelato"}
{"text":"Came by for coffee the other day and it was mediocre at best. For $6, coffee was overpriced...

The latte came out at a decent temperature, espresso was smooth and they tried to make it extra foamy.

Service was lackluster...maybe because they are inside a hotel on the strip?"}
{"text":"With my feet killing me from my uber fabulous shoes, we stopped at Espressamente Illy.  The Marocchino Caldo made everything in my world great again ;) !!!"}
{"text":"I went during a very busy time during Memorial weekend so I understand that it was crazy but I was happy with my experience because I didn't wait too long for my Affogato. I chose the Vanilla flavor scoop of gelato which was topped with their strong coffee (which I actually couldn't finish! Very rich!) and delicious whipped cream and espresso powder.

PERKS:

There are many outlets and USB ports available if you need to recharge during your vacation. Also was a fan of the decor."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee! There is definitely a Vegas/Italy mark up on their coffee though, it's quite expensive! 

Service was great and everyone was extremely friendly. I asked for half vanilla in my latte and it still was extremely sweet but they were very kind and remade it for me. Unless you like your drinks sweet I would definitely recommend going with half the flavor! 

We made this our go to coffee shop while staying at the Palazzo."}
{"text":"\"illy\". I love love you?
I don't love you back, ice cream. 

$5.50 for ONE scoop and another $2 for one more scoop. Served in a small cup that you can easily wrap your hand around. What has our world come to?

I got the pineapple ice cream, thinking it would be some Dole-pineapple taste. Wrong! There's barely any pineapple flavor! It's more creamy-flavored or some kind of coconut flavor. It's hard to even tell that it's pineapple without knowing you bought it. Not great.

The service was really rushed. The guy behind the counter asked us if we were ready while still skimming through each flavor. Everything looked good on the outside, but for $5.50/scoop, I think I'd rather go to Sbarro's or some Italian gelato/ice cream shop. Ciao, ciao!"}
{"text":"Espresso at its best. Great location in the Palazzo, it is the perfect place for a pick me up!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee so hot, you won't taste it (or anything else).

Don't get me wrong, it's a fine product, illy coffee is one of my favorites; but here at the illy espressamente shop, they make it just a little hotter than they should. (Ten minutes later and I'm still burning my tongue trying to get a sip). I'm sure once it cools down a little (a lot) it will be delicious. I'm just not sure I have the patience."}
{"text":"strongest latte i've had in US ;-) not cheap, for sure, but that's vegas for you. my husband loved his macchiatos too :-) just like in italy...

we walked out cos it looked so fast-foodie but we went back in after recommendations from the Cut receptionist. so glad we decided to try it. we had coffee here twice and we'll try to have all future coffees in vegas here :-)"}
{"text":"This cute little shop serves tons of gelato, desserts, and even espresso (I think they do the cream hearts here!). Like their little stand in the grand canal area, it's very pricey but it's refreshing and you just can't resist when in Vegas (when in rome - well, \"venice\")."}
{"text":"Gelato is good, not the greatest - but they have tons of flavors to choose from, I'll have to keep trying.

They have tons of tasty looking desserts, sandwiches and coffee."}
{"text":"Good espressos, crepe was a little over cooked (more brown than tan)
Anyways, regardless of the higher prices here (being in the casino), the service could stand to improve a GREAT deal.  The folks behind the counter appear to hate life and treat customers the same way. If im paying $15 for a drink and crepe, i expect top level service, especially in the palazzo"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas, I stop in here for some treats.  

This place is a gleaming marriage between an Italian style cafe and Las Vegas pretension.  The inside is stylish and a bit on the cold side.  I wouldn't call it cozy, but it's a fine place to stop in and get some gelato or one of the many coffee drinks.  

The gelato, is, as some have said, not the best in Vegas, but they offer many flavors and the location is convenient.  The coffee drinks are served with such variety that I've been here about 4 or 5 times, always getting something different, and I still haven't made my way through them all.  From espressos flavored with chocolate to frozen coffee granita style, there's something for every coffee lover.

They also serve light lunch fare like crepes and finger sandwiches.

Illy is a great coffee brand, so it's no surprise that everything I've had here is of a decent quality, but you also pay dearly for that.  This place is far from cheap.

If you're a fan of Illy, or of coffee in general, I'd say this is a no-brainer.  If you're looking for gelato, there is better on offer elsewhere."}
{"text":"`BF and I have come a few times before for gelato but this recent visit I tried out the crepes. 

I had a nutella filled crepe with a scoop of hazelnut gelato on top. The crepe consistency was just right and Nutella with the gelato was just comfort at it's finest. 

The surprise was the BFs shake. He's been here enough to know the shakes so he cuts the fruit gelatos with some yogurt....he ordered this time half cherry and half yogurt. What came out was a drink delight that reminds me of those Asian yogurt drinks like Yakult...and I love that yogurty tangy flavor!

I tried to steal a few sips since dinner plus a crepe put me way over to even attempt to get my own."}
{"text":"yummy vanilla latte only downfall is its $7 for a small"}
{"text":"Stale and tasteless macarons. Can't believe I paid that much just to get home and eat cardboard like cookies. I tasted a few and all they're all the same so I threw them out:( Such a waste, save your money and go elsewhere!!!! Disappointing since I was really craving them.."}
{"text":"Cappucino's are consistently good but I was more than perplexed by what they call a 'dine-in' fee (check out a photo of my receipt). This basically means that it's cheaper to buy your coffee in a disposable cup, which they ironically fill with more milk (thereby ruining their otherwise great cappucino's). Yet another example for the price you pay for trying to be more Eco-concious and saving the Earth from an extra paper cup. Love the coffee but must say 'no!' to this ridiculous and harmful policy."}
{"text":"The lychee gelato was dilizioso! I let each scoop melt on my tongue so I could enjoy every ounce of it. 1 scoop for $5.50 better be worth it!

Nicole loved the iced mocha drink so much that she shelled out $7.50 for it. On two occasions. They must have shipped that coffee in directly from Italy.

It's Vegas. INDULGE!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space with comfy leather banquette if you're eating in. I had an outstanding cappuccino and a ham and mozzarella panini.  It had fresh basil which I liked. It was pretty good but I wouldn't say 5 stars, esp considering these items totaled $20. 

No question I would come back for the cappuccino."}
{"text":"The watermelon gelato was heavenly and very refreshing but it also cost an arm and a leg....$4 for ONE scoop!! what a rip off. So go if you're willing to splurge on gelato."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I ordered a latte and didn't like the taste and asked the server what type of milk he used and he was very rude. And didn't want to answer my question.  I will not go back since the service was very bad."}
{"text":"I heart good espresso as much as I heart good cocktails - and this place does not disappoint.  Illy has an extensive menu of every different type of espresso based drink you could imagine.  On my recent trip I sampled a latte and \"espresso macchiato\" - both were perfectly pulled and tasted incredible (the espresso almost tastes like there is cocoa in it because it is so rich and the texture is like velvet on your tongue - wow, that is a bit porno, but it is true, totally orgasmic).

As a tip, we tried to order the latte with skim milk and were (sweetly) told that they recommend whole or 2% milk with their espresso...so we added the fat and enjoyed every second of it.

Since we were adding fat anyway, we also tried two gelatos and both were fantastic.  Order smalls because they are seriously packed with flavor!

The prices are high, but I would hit this place again in a minute!"}
{"text":"I love me gelato even thought I don't get it often. This location has plenty of selection to choose from and I mean plenty! You will spend way too much time trying to decide which flavor to get. No joke. You might even ruin your vacation wasting time. 

The gelato is top notch. Has the mixed berry and mango and every single bite was pure bliss. I was already full from dinner, but I kept going. 

Only downside is the price as I paid almost $9 bucks for two scoops. No joke. Still a great location with great food."}
{"text":"I love this coffee!!!!!!  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable...The location is great...The food was Fab....Wish I found it on my first day of my LV trip instead of my last........Go here or don't drink coffee...That is all....."}
{"text":"$7 for a mocha?! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"A go-to spot for pre or post shopping refreshment. There are limited choices for non-alcoholic drinks near the Palazzo shops. They have a good selection of beverages and snacks. The coffee drinks are executed well, but I always find myself slurping on my straw too soon. In other words, the drinks are small. If you're getting refreshment on the rocks, ask for light ice to counter this sad fact."}
{"text":"Like Cafe Presse, it's a good spot for some joe or espresso drinks.  Those with a sweet tooth will enjoy the selection of gelato here too."}
{"text":"@ the Palazzo

After finding out the \"overpriced Valentine's weekend\" price 
and the line for the gondola rides
we walked around taking pictures
and came across this nicely set up place.
And of course the ladies wanted some gelato~

one scoop of gelato/sorbet = $5.50
holy crap!

I had pistachio
and my bf had cappuccino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HnbkGxUs7oWKYDeB-Pk82Q?select=JQ7yChi5Vs9JTMZBhnn1Gg..
both were extra creamy that 
after a couple licks and bites here and there
I got sick of it and didn't finish eating it. :P
(good thing we only got 1 scoop each x])
and they give you this tiny red \"spoon\"
the same one they give you for tasting.. o.O

They also have crepes, sammiches, and other desserts
we didn't bother getting 'cause we had a BIG lunch..
maybe next time? :P"}
{"text":"The new holiday latte, Chestnut latte and Sweet and Spiced, are so much better than the sugary mint ones at Starbucks.  This cafe serves more than great coffee! It includes lucious sweets and light lunches as well.  My visit here did not disappoint and is definitely my go to place for coffee in Yorkdale now.

The store is located on the second level in the new food court area and it has a great open space that allows you to look down onto the 'courtyard' lobby.  Seating is not so plentiful but it's secluded from the large food court so it's quieter in addition to being cleaner.  When we went, it was 90% filled around 1 pm.  There isn't a traditional waitstaff but they do take away your dishes and clean the tables quite thoroughly when you're ready to leave.

I ordered a Chestnut latte, a chocolate croissant, cannoli (small), americano, and a hot chocolate for our small group.  I should have order more food as someone devoured the cannoli in under a minute. She normally doesn't like cannoli's as they're filled with cream (instead of ricotta) and just overloaded with sugar with a soggy crust.  The textures and overheightened sweetness puts her off.  This cannoli is possibly the best cannoli I've had out of a mall.  The cannoli had that great shatter of a freshly made shell.  It wasn't too hard from being over fried but had that perfect balance of crispiness without being too thick and crunchy.  The filling was REAL ricotta cheese!  What a pleasant surprise.  It had that nice light tangy taste but was lightly sweetened.  I grabbed a mini bite before my toddler took everything of it.  The chocolate croissant was also very nice.  Buttery, crispy and shattered lightly under a small bite, and good amount of dark chocolate inside.  The hot chocolate was more chocolate than sugar (yay!) and the latte I had was wonderful.  A warm nuttiness was the perfect compliment to the low acidity but bold coffee flavour.  It played wonderfully with my usual caffiene requirement and makes me wish they kept it the entire year.  The americano was fantastic as well.  It wasn't overly water, wasn't bitter or heavily acidic, and had a great bold flavour that you'd expect.

This place is more expensive than Tim Horton's but I feel the flavours and quality is significantly higher than your average mall fare.  I will come back over and over to try their seasonal flavours since they're unique (no usual pumpkin spice or candy cane flavours) and have lots of nice little treats to savour.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little coffee shop at the intersection of The Venetian and Palazzo.  If your in the Canal shops at the end of Palazzo just go down the escalator and it's on your right.  

They have a ton of different espresso, cappuccino and coffee drinks as well as breakfast items, sandwiches and gelato's.   

The service was quick and the coffee items are all excellent.  I'm a happy camper that this is just a short walk from our room. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love illy coffee, but here it takes a year to get an $8 latte, and you line up regardless of how many customers they have. 

Why? 

Slowest fucking coffee makers in the world.

Good news is, there are only 3 customers. I may get out of here with a latte in under 20 min."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for liquid crack.. and by liquid crack I mean their delicious, perfectly made, espresso macchiatos. The balance of steamed milk and freshly ground illy espresso bean is the ideal fix to wake me up, keep me going, or make me sober again. I felt that the staff put great effort into crafting the cup the way it should be crafted: with ease, patience, and style. Great experience indeed!"}
{"text":"Delicious, but terribly expensive gelato. I'd make comparisons to gelato in Berkeley but that's not fair since everything costs a limb in Vegas.

For $5.50 you can have one scoop of gelato. Their flavors are great, however, with an abundant variety. Take advantage of the samples to narrow down your choice unless you want to pay nearly $8 for two scoops.

The staff here could use some cheering up, however, lest  I feel like I'm making their day shitty by ordering a gelato on a hot summer day.

Great cappuccino: milk frothed perfectly and velvety smooth. such a pretty latte art too!

The cannoli is decent, I had better but the filling here is smooth and the crust has just the right crunch!

{"text":"This tantalizing cafe is filled with delicious coffee and dessert options! It's hard to select what to order, but since I wanted some coffee for our long drive back to LA, I got the iced \"Cappucino Fredo Shakerato\" ($5.85). I was initially shell-shocked by the prices, but then I realized I really shouldn't be. Considering that it's on prime real estate in Vegas, as well as one of the few actual \"coffee shops\" on the strip, the Sin City inflation should've been accounted for.

The cappuccino itself was delicious! Sweet, but not offensively so, and very strong! I was running on 10.5 hours of sleep throughout 3 nights in Vegas, and this cup of coffee (it only comes in one size - 16oz) managed to keep me awake during the brutal car ride. 

I really wished I got a chance to try their desserts, but at least I know where to go the next time I'm in town!"}

The gelato was pretty good with a wide selection of choices; I had their pistachio (the best I've had) and lychee (which was mediocre, as it had flavor initially but lost it towards the end). If I was just rating the gelato, I would probably give this place 4 stars..."}

First of all, the staff was incredibly rude. They acted like we were bothering them by placing an order. Seriously? And don't you dare ask a question - you'll get some eye rolls. Dude, this is Vegas and you work in the restaurant industry, you should probably learn to deal with people.

We shared a chocolate croissant and my husband got a coffee. Our total was 12$ - not even kidding. The croissant was dry and tiny. For the price we paid, I expected something at least decent.

If the staff was friendlier, I wouldn't have been moved to write a review on this place (despite the high prices and lousy food) because it was just a quick breakfast, but you have far better options nearby. Don't waste your time, money, and calories on this place."}
{"text":"The affagato was sweet and creamy! Two scoops of your choice gelato and two shots of espresso :)"}
{"text":"My review is only for the coffee - I did not try the gelatos (there were none out yet at 8am), or any of the pastries. We were staying at the Palazzo, so I had to try this place out. They open at 6am, so if you're awake that early (or haven't slept yet), this is the place to go. I had the cappuccino (my tummy can't handle the lactose in the lattes anymore), and it was delicious. No bitterness to it - it didn't need sugar or anything. The caffeine buzz from it was perfect as well, no jitters or heart palpitations. It also helps to be drinking it within the beauty that is the Shoppes of the Palazzo... Give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"Gelato galore! Crunchy Rum was my favorite, I tasted the Guava and although it was good (it's an acquired taste) it was too sweet. If you're in a group and don't mind taste testing what each had, that's an ideal situation. The service was slow, it could be better. They really should have more people scooping ice cream, 1 doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Be careful. The cashier upgrades your beverage to large without asking. I paid $7.00 for a chai latte!!!!!! I love tea but that's a bit overboard."}
{"text":"charged my friend for food when they run out of basically everything in the menu, they dont even apologize for any of their mistake? not to mention their menu doesnt even stay up to date on the time for food availability.. worst experience ever"}
{"text":"crepes, gelato and coffee is really good here!!!!!!!

i love this place and everytime im at palazzo i stop here!"}
{"text":"great location. sweet staff, fast service, great gelato and espresso. my only comment is 2 scoops of ice cream and an espresso cost me $19 but i'm in vegas lol!"}
{"text":"Yes it's sleek and beautiful, but the staff was totally bored and unexciting for a new espresso/gelato shop like this.  The quality of the gelato, although presented beautifully, was only average, and the prices are a bit much, even by Vegas standards.  Instead, I'll burn a few calories taking a hike over to Caesar's and pig out at Payard Patisserie!"}
{"text":"The line to place your order is poorly organized. I jumped in and being new to the place I missed the whole right side of the shop: display cases with yummy looking pastries and the menu.  So not knowing all my options I just got a sundae- which was good, 3 scoops. I just wish I could have seen it all before I ordered."}
{"text":"freaking expensive but sooo freaking good! never had a better pistacio gelato! yes,yes, 6 bucks for 1 scoop but its really awesome! the hazelnut comes in second.  can't wait to try the sorbet next! oh and free wifi for customers!"}
{"text":"Food: We saw the huge selection of gelato from upstairs and we couldn't wait to get down there to try some! The straciatella was great and all the other gelato flavors looked just as delicious.

Price: A bit pricey, I believe I paid around $11 for each of us to get 1 scoop.

Service: Definitely was crowded in here but we got in and out of here pretty fast.

Atmosphere: There are a few places to sit and eat but we decided to head out since there were alot of people in here.

Location: Located in the Palazzo downstairs at the shops. Near the waterfall."}
{"text":"Rather than wait in a line that was 20 people deep at The Coffee Bean inside The Palazzo, I decided to venture a few steps further and grabbed my morning jolt from Espressamente.  

Although my pastry seemed a bit dry, it was still good and my Americana stole the show.  It was strong, but not too strong and the perfect way to start my day.  

They had a beautiful (and very colorful) display of gelato, but I never made it back to try any.  

Next time!"}
{"text":"Very tasty coffee.  Fabulous coffee concoction menu.  Delightful service... so friendly and willing to make tweaks as necessary.  Perfect stop for a quick pick-me-up before a 10:30 pm show!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the set-up to this place is a bit bananas. A long display case of gelato greets you, there is a center counter where they ring you up and occasionally take your order, and then more display case. Seeing as how everyone visiting Vegas is always a little confused, the lack of direction here seems to be a bit of an issue. Alas, I like this place a lot, even though it's full of confused patrons.

My order was taken for a double espresso. The counter staff was energetic and efficient. The very handsome Italian man who was making my drink even took the time to ask if I wanted to enjoy my double shot in a cup *for here* because, let's be serious, nobody likes espresso in a paper cup.

The espresso was creamy and smooth. A perfect sippable snack that is just in need of a gelato sidekick."}
{"text":"Not up to illy's standards! Worst service we've experienced in years.  If you mess up on an order twice, and don't offer a refund, that's horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mocha coffee, just right. Their chocolate mousse bomb was light and not sweet like the Europeans like it. Great modern decor, really helpful staff, a delightful place."}
{"text":"I always stop in for a quick pick-me-up when I'm walking between the Venetian and Palazzo.  I'll get either an espresso or affogato.  They have a great selection  of gelato from which to choose.  Those are great tasting and offer you opportunities to any any of these flavors in your affogato."}
{"text":"Located in the Yorkdale mall on the first landing going to their food court stands this coffee place - right on top of Coach.

I've been here off and on for a good cup of coffee and some dessert when I feel that I deserve a sugar rush - oh yeah!

Chic, modern, and terribly busy.  Seating inside the place and out on their pseudo-patio is at a premium most of the time.

Price is high but the coffee is nice and their lattes are better than most places in the mall.  Their desserts are really good - the new wave of colourful macaroons are very popular.  I don't understand when the chewy baked coconut morsels lost it's name to the cookie like dessert.  Go figure.

After running around the mall battling insane shoppers and tourists.  It's a nice haven to get into la dolce vita!

Cheers."}
{"text":"Love illy coffee. Fresh delicious tasting gelato and a friendly staff. I stop here before work inside the casino often and find it a perfect start to my mornings"}
{"text":"This place needs some work in regards to their operations. It literally took more than 20 minutes to get my crepe. Other customers had the same issue. They should have someone dedicated to that station or at least a backup as they did have employees standing around while we all waited. Also, they needed to make more crepe mix - why would they not be making more while they served crepes in the middle of a day during a busy holiday weekend? The coffee was served quickly but everything else took forever. The crepe really wasn't very good either, I didn't even eat half. My friend's affogato was good though - although she did say the coffee was very strong. I would not recommend this spot if you plan to get anything other than coffee."}
{"text":"As an Aussie and a new local I'm still finding my way around Las Vegas. I'm particularly picky when it comes to coffee and to be quite honest I haven't had a decent coffee in Las Vegas since I've been here until a few days ago,my husband and I drove into the strip to see a show and we stopped here for a quick pre show snack. The coffee was made perfectly as a proper cappuccino should be, so good in fact I had two. We also purchased two crêpes which were amazing. I just wish it was closer and I'd be here daily for my caffeine hit."}
{"text":"Perfect pick me up spot after a long day of shopping or gambling. I went for the Amore, which was a bit pricey ($5+) but was very refreshing and unique: an Italian take on an Irish Coffee (sans alcohol). It was refreshing while also sweet. 

I've also never seen such an array of gelato flavor options. Gotta try them all."}
