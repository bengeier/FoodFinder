{"text":"Really homey feel and food was delicious. I went here for lunch and had kefta on a pan. Hidden new gem"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, Marcel and Diala are so friendly and welcoming and the food is delightful!"}
{"text":"Seriously best Middle Eastern cuisine in midtown. Everything we tried from their menu was delicious and made with tons of love and care. Will be back many times...so happy I found this place. If you're looking for authentic Syrian cuisine, this is the place"}
{"text":"Came here while we were visiting Toronto, being an Arab (Palestinian) to be specific I was looking forward to try this place since Syrian food and Palestinian are very much a like.. food is very authentic and reminds me of being home ! I loved the idea that the mother is cooking inside and her daughters serve the food .. you can feel the love and passion in what they do !!  We ordered the fatteh which a hummus dish with bread it was very good and rich in flavor .. we also had a hawader sampler which basically what we usually eat for breakfast or dinner back home.. every thing was very authentic and closest thing to the culture !  Deseret was awesome .. everything you see in the stand is stunning !  Loved the atmosphere and fairouz playing in the background :)"}
{"text":"I was searching for middle eastern restaurant and came across this new place. The menu was simple and good. i stepped in today it was so busy, and it gave me feel sort of like \"at home\".  I ordered chicken wrap, kebbeh(vegan) and baklava. Chicken wrap was so yummy and you can actually have the taste of home cooked in every bite. The kebbeh is flavourful and cooked to perfection.The baklava is the best one that i have ever tasted. People over there are very friendly and answers to all your questions. On whole its an awesome experience and would like to go again. Tip- to taste the dish of the day make sure to reach there early."}
{"text":"Really pretty cafe. Family run and they seem to be making an effort to get to know the locals, and charms to everyone in. We've only had the chicken kebab ( amazing) and one of their dishes of the day ( a chicken and spinach stew with rice) but both excellent."}
{"text":"Really the most charming restaurant I've visited in a long time. It's in a fairly posh area of town, a couple short blocks south of Yonge and Eglinton. The vibe is very friendly and welcoming, with an bright and airy look that brings to mind the French countryside.   The food is purely, genuinely Syrian. The two Syrian friends who were with me said it was the real deal, which makes sense since it's a family restaurant, with the sisters in the front and their mom as the main chef.   How good is the food? They get walk-in customers by leaving the door open and releasing the scent of the main dish of the day - chicken shawarma, when I was there. There was also a steady stream of Uber drivers picking up bags for take-out, people coming to play boardgames, intellectual types from places as far as Egypt... and Oakville.   The customers and energy changes over the course of the day, making it three or four restaurants in one. Worth a repeat visit for that reason, and for the food and hospitality of the hosts.  The Syrian takeover of Toronto cuisine has begun. Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern restaurant I have visited in a long time. Incredible food. Amazing service and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place. Small, family run, and from what I gather relatively new. unfortunately it shows. I had the Shakriya which was underwhelming and the portions small. Service was slow/ I was never offered a menu + I was never even offered any water. The price point was ok. I wish them luck and hope they can take it up a Notch."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the amazing food here - we ate too much and everything tasted great. My only beef was paying $1.50 for Toronto tap water. Uncool!"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern- Syrian specifically- restaurant in town. Delicious food, friendly staff, reasonable price! I would always go back for more!"}
{"text":"I'd like to keep this place all to myself, but the women running it are so darn lovely, and the food is just so good, we all want them to keep cooking and to have every success they clearly deserve.   I went here twice in four days and shared a bunch of dishes with a friend. The food is freshly prepared and delish! Roasted cauliflower with tahini that was heavenly, a chicken and spinach with lemon stew - yum, roasted red pepper dip with some serious heat, yes please. The second visit was a ground beef dish with a sauce full of interesting spices, fatteh was a new combo to me and was so satisfying and fattoush salad, nice and fresh.   Don't skip dessert! I love the sesame biscuits, and the honey cake. Mint tea comes in a big pot for two. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great prices, yummy food and warm service. Definitely worth checking out. It can get quite busy at peak hours and they sometimes run out of the daily specials, so you're better off coming a bit early."}
{"text":"Very kind people and they have the yummiest shawarma ever"}
{"text":"Moderate quality food and expensive for what it offers small portions economizing on essential ingredients  like meat etc. Once there never again. For the amount that I paid I could have gotten a much nicer meal in other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I am from the Middle East so I know what good authentic middleeastern food taste like and this was pretty awesome! We ordered the fateh and the meze plate and both were awesome."}
{"text":"Zezafoun opened recently. It's a cozy mom and pops kinda restaurant which is run by all women staff .The food was fresh and definitely felt  like I was eating at home! We tried the Dolma(wrapped grape leaf) which was ok, fatteh (best seller), falafel and chicken shawarma! Everything tasted very good and fresh. Give this place a try and you will be surprised.  There is parking available as well as street parking.  The staff are very nice and learning how to run a restaurant so the service may be slow and needs improvement!  I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you heard about Syrian food, YES! this's the place. The beautiful? family who runs? the restaurant???, trying? their best to inspire customers with traditional? Syrian cuisines? cooked with their passion."}
{"text":"Very cozy, small restaurant around Yonge and Eglinton. I've tried 3 of their specials of the day and were all very tasty and authentic homemade food. They also have a small patio which is great for summer days!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Zezafoun. The food was really good. I wanted to try things that I never had before. Had the muhamara, fatteh and a dish of the day, which was chicken mansaf. All of it was fantastic. Also had this apricot drink, the name of it escapes me though, was also good. The service was great. We were made to feel at home and not afraid to ask any \"dumb\" questions. Very homey place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and got a falafel wrap.  All the components were fresh and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the pickled vegetables.  Price was very reasonable. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was out and about on a recent Saturday running a few errands when I noticed Zezafoun out of the corner of my eye. I was surprised to see it there because the last time I was in the area, there was an entirely different restaurant sitting in that location.  I walked in and the joint was empty, but the proprietor was very friendly and welcoming. I wasn't interested in getting a meal in house, but I did want to grab a few things to try at home. I got:  Vegan Vine Leaves (\"Stuffed vine leaves with rice, tomatoes, lemon juice mixed with Syrian spices cooked with pieces of potatoes and fresh tomatoes\"): My first thought after taking a bite out of one of the three included Vine Leaves was: \"this tastes a lot like the vine leaves my grandmother used to make.\" It's really, really good. The various flavors really worked well together and it tasted super fresh, too.  I initially also ordered the hummus but then I noticed something called Aleppo Muhamara (\"A delicious dip of roasted minced red pepper, walnut, hot pepper, bread crumbs and pomegranate molasses served with olives oil on top\") on the menu and decided to get that instead. I'm so glad I did because this dip pretty much knocked my socks off. The flavor in this thing was, to quote Guy Fieri, out of bounds and completely on point. I happily ate the entire thing with the accompanying pita bread within minutes.  I'm excited that the Yonge/Eglinton area finally appears to have a quality Middle Eastern joint, and there's little doubt that Zezafoun puts the nearby Paramount to shame."}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish.  We came with another couple none of us had tried Syrian food before.  We ordered the kebbeh, fatteh, Aleppo muhamara, hawader platter, mujadara and two dishes of the day.  All were very delicious with really interesting flavour combinations.  The server explained that her mother is the chef and she is clearly a very talented lady.  The first dish of the day was beef cooked in yogurt.  The beef was so tender and the sauce was delicious and very unique.  The server explained it is a difficult dish to master as it is very easy to curdle the yogurt. The second was a vegetarian dish of bugler and a delicious sweet and spicy tomato topping.  This was probably my favourite.  I loved to spice and sweetness and big chunks of stewed tomatoes.  The Syrian coffee was also fantastic - nice and thick with a hint of cardamon. Tip: add a bit of sugar even if you don't normally take it as it makes the flavours really pop.  We also tried several different cookies which were so addictive I took some home.  I highly recommend Zezafoun and we will definitely be back for more delicious Syrian cuisine."}
{"text":"As a Lebanese who enjoys homemade food, I get quite picky about the quality of the Mediterranean food/Levantine cuisine I eat at restaurants, but I felt right at home at Zezafoun. They prepare dishes that you grow up eating. We ordered fatouch, the eggplant dish, the bulgur and tomato dish, labneh, and an assortment of desserts.    I also love the intimacy of the space -- and the fact that its family-run is a plus. I'll be back on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Really - there aren't enough Syrian restaurants in Toronto.   That's one of Zezafoun's virtues, honestly. Outside of the excellent food, remember that you are supporting a family business.  I ordered the Fatteh - a common Arabic dish, done perfectly here. It was so good that for my next visit, I would consider ignoring the other dishes and ordering it again.   Of course, that would only be a slight consideration, as it would be of utmost importance to sample more parts of the menu!  While salty, ingredients such as the chickpeas and almonds were well-represented, and accented the dish perfectly.   Zezafoun is a gem, owned by a family, which, by all accounts, is an absolute pleasure."}
{"text":"Omg where shall i start. I was searching on Yelp for a place and wanted to try something new and stumbled upon this place. Words cant describe how amazing is the food. I was speechless and actually took 3 plates for friends so they can experience what i have. I had dish of the day. Made fresh daily!! Got to meet the founders and they are beyond sweet and hospitable. Def a must try"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place. The food is super delicious, and the Syrian coffee is on point. They have daily meals, and had plenty of meat and veggie options. The owner is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place with wonderful owners and very tasty authentic Syrian cuisine. Don't pay attention to the negative review. The account was created specifically for that one bad review and obviously just a hit job by some local competition."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The fatteh was out of this world. Went for Sunday brunch, we were a big group and pretty excited about trying the place out, so we wanted many things! The food didn't disappoint, the wait was worth it. The owners are super sweet AND funny."}
{"text":"4.5 Star - writing this as I just finished my meal here.  Service: a spot run by a family with 2 sisters, food cooked by their mother. Very friendly and helpful service.  Food: I ordered one of the dishes of the day (they had 4 options) called Molukhia (spinach-like greens and chicken stew) that comes with white rice.  The dish is light, not greasy, with a hint of sourness from the lemon,m which reminds me a lot Persian dishes because of the sourness, and the chicken was very easy to cut with the spoon, the meat just falls apart easily.  Overall: great spot in the neighbourhood for lunch/brunch! Would come back again to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and felt really cozy in this is a family own restaurant. I took my bf there for bday and they gave us free desserts which were very yummy.  Some items run out very early during the day. Might have to call ahead to reserve.  Some items are not on the menu. It really depends on the mood of the owner. :)  Overall I liked the experience."}
{"text":"You can tell by the customer service here that these ladies are perfect at multitasking..but the touting tail swinging foxes of this area are really rattling their nerves...my advice to everyone is please review the authentic food in advance because it's indeed something out of the world and you will need patience to savour it (-;  I ordered lentil soup @ $6.99 which was done very middle eastern style, lentils were finely grinded, very earthy, peppery taste, delicious perfect for a cold afternoon, best lentil soup I have tasted in town...  Also,  Falafel bites with Tahini-- three yummy pieces...perfectly flavoured..authentic!  Will be definitely back here to try more!"}
{"text":"Only place in Toronto where I get told off whenever I leave a tip  but the food is so good and the servers so friendly and charming that I have no choice. If you haven't tried out this place yet you are truly missing out"}
{"text":"I stopped in today and really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and the lovely hospitality.  They care about their food and your dining experience. Fresh, healthy and made with love, what else can you ask for!"}
{"text":"This place is authentic! Very delicious food and friendly staff. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Arabic Syrian food."}
{"text":"I got the daily dish which I enjoyed quite a bit. I liked the homely feel of the restaurant. I am definitely going to come back to check out different daily dishes!"}
{"text":"The most important thing about this restaurant is hot food made fresh. This makes flavors really good. Portions are reasonably sized. This also covers for the bit slow service as u will wait for a bit but your wait will be rewarded by a fresh and good tasting food."}
{"text":"I'm Lebanese and this was the best, delicious and authentic Middle Eastern food. The brunch was amazing. Highly recommend"}
