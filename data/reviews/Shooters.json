{"text":"We used to love shooters and eat there all the time. We hadn't been in a while so we had lunch there today. I don't know if the restaurant has changed owners or management but we were very dissatisfied with our service. I usually get the black bean burger but that's no longer on the menu so that was a bummer. We waited 30 minutes before a server even acknowledged us. Then it took another 10 minutes to get a glass of water. It took 45 minutes to get our food, and when it came the server said, \"I need to go find some silverware.\" And she didn't come back for 20 minutes. By then the food was cold. My meal was supposed to come with chips and a pickle but I didn't get either of those. The server only stopped by our table two more times after that, once to refill water and once to give us the check. We kept trying to get her attention but she never looked our way. Even when she brought our water refills she set it down while talking to the guests at the table behind us. Overall we were there for over two hours and spent about 10 minutes eating. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"On Friday, I decided to order carryout since I was having a yard sale.  Since Shooters is so close and I'd been pleased with food and service while dining there several years ago. I thought why not?  I went online to view the menu and chose the Spinach Salad.  My friend chose the Steakburger.  I called the restaurant to order.  I was told upon ordering the Spinach Salad that they didn't have it and she named the salads she did have.  The website had a menu that was updated in 2012.  So I ordered the chicken sandwich.  I asked if they had honey mustard dressing.  She asked if I wanted it dressed.  I said yes with honey mustard.  She told me I could pick it up in ten minutes.  I walked up to the restaurant to pick it up.  I paid for the order and included 10% tip.  Several minutes passed and she let me know the order would be out shortly.  She came out of the kitchen and handed me the order.  My friend's order was fine.  Mine was not.  The chicken sandwich was neither dressed nor had honey mustard on it.  So..I ate it anyway...no one cared enough to make sure the order was right?  The sandwich was edible but you could've made my day by getting it right!"}
{"text":"Hand down the best place in madison to get a good craft beer. THEY HAD THREE FLOYDS ZOMBIE DUST ON TAP! How does that even happen? Amazing... 

The food is good, 50 cent wings on Sundays...their black and blue burger is fantastic as well...and their crab dip (when available) is fantastic. But we go here for the beer. 

Amazing selection...rotate their taps pretty regularly...awesome bottle selection as well. Bartender is pretty great, always super friendly and willing to suggest a good beer. 

Service is sub-par at best. Unless the owner/bartender is waiting on you, then you get pretty good service. Not a knowledgeable staff about their beer (which drives me up the wall...) The beer makes up for that though in my personal opinion...."}
{"text":"Excellent, nice staff, good service. The fish sandwich is stupid big but awesome, been in town for a week and ordered it twice. 
A lot of beer on tap and bottled"}
{"text":"The salads here are the only reason this place doesn't get a lower rating.  Great bar food too but the room is just a little loud and awkward.  Going with big groups means you're stuck next to the restrooms and the speakers and a 2nd entrance.  

We try to go here and like it but the food is the only good thing here.  The deep fried banana peppers are unique, and subtle if you like something with a kick."}
{"text":"Food is alright it's nothing special. Service is good. The food is a bit pricy. The burgers tend to be overcooked and there's a lack of flavor. Burgers come with chips which are usually over cooked and bland. The loaded potato skins were very dry and over cooked. Nit bad but not anything special"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our anniversary while visiting Madison, Indiana for some wings and a beer.  The wings were mediocre.  We wanted to check our fantasy football teams and watch some football.  The waitress gave us two wrong passwords for wifi.  No big deal as we have plenty of data.  We ordered two Bud Light bottles at $2.75 each.  We noticed a sign behind the bar advertising 16 ounce draft Bud Lights for $2.00.  When I asked our waitress about it, she said, \"I asked you if you wanted draft or bottles.\". We won't be back."}
{"text":"We're here for the day enjoying the Madison Chautauqua Festival with 50,000 others. Lunch time has escaped us when suddenly we decided lunch is a must ASAP. Checking my Yelp bookmarks Shooters is our second choice but are we ever happy we couldn't get in the first restaurant on my list.  

As we entered there was a small wait but several people were close to leaving. We only waited 5 minutes before the sweat drenched man hussling his butt off had cleaned 5 tables. The restaurant was full of patrons laughing, enjoying beers, cocktails and entrees that caught our attention as the servers went past. 

The bar area was full of regulars and tourists having a great time some watching the 2 big screen, flat panel TVs over the bar. Sports bar this is with a total of 13 TVs in the restaurant for your viewing pleasure. There are two bar tops, back to back, with 8 seats per bar area. They carry 15 craft beers on tap with 10 craft bottle beers and a full bar. 

Everyone was extremely friendly, the menu was affordable, and the atmosphere was exactly what we needed. Due to the Chautauqua Festival, Shooters was using their limited menu to save the kitchen from a slow death. Fortunately we received the regular menu which both of us were excited about. Yes, we had to give the regular menu back and order from the limited menu but we've decided we have to dine here on our next trip. 

Shooters is what you'd expect when you hear Sports Bar. Lots of tables filled with families, food, laughter, beers, and cocktails. The decor is brick walls and hardwood floors, and a large, wooden double bar very reminiscent of a Man Cave but with lots of natural lighting.

We started with Boneless Wings (10 - $6.99) and split 5 and 5 with the Hot Buffalo and Tropical Habanero sauce. The Chicken was all white meat and the Tropical Habanero was our favorite sauce. The hot buffalo sauce brought tears to our eyes when delivered and yummy.

My husband had the tender Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8.49) on a hoagie bun and it was delicious. You can tell the meat has been slow roasted then topped off with a sweet bbq sauce and served with house-made chips. Chips were to crunchy for our taste.  The only problem we encountered was the menu didn't mention the parmesan cheese topping on of the hoagie. He's allergic so he just pulled off the top bun and turned it into a fork sandwich.

I ordered the Ghost Burger ($9.99) simply because of the special blends of seasonings and ghost peppers in the burger then topped with grilled purple onions, Applewood smoked bacon, and a ghost pepper cheese. The burger was a nice size, cooked perfectly  and the spices and flavors worked well together. The sandwich is served with Excellent seasoned fries and I upcharged for scrumptious Cheese fries. The first layer of cheese was similar to hot, poured Cheese Whiz then smothered with melted Monterrey Jack cheese over the well seasoned fries. Cheesy, fattening and heavenly.

Everything was wonderful from all of the friendly servers,  ice cold beer (Octoberfest), tasty appetizers and delicious sandwiches. We only wish they were closer to Indy. We'll be back to sample the rather large, regular menu when there isn't a festival."}
{"text":"Last week, my husband and I met up with a group of friends for dinner and drinks before heading to a local music venue a few doors down from Shooters. The place was packed--it was a Saturday night--but we sat down pretty quickly. The wait staff was pretty quick and attentive, but the waiter's knowledge of their beer was less than good. She mispronounced and \"misexplained\" the beers on tap. So when I ordered a beer she explained as a hoppy brown beer, I was surprised to have a bourbon barrel stout arrive. The food is classic bar fair, with interesting specials. I was a bit disappointed by their beer special of $3 pints my husband ordered showing up as $5 a pint on our ticket, but she fixed the mistake after we showed her. 

Overall, I give this local bar/grill a 3 star review due to the lack of knowledge of beer in a location that touts a wide array of beers as a drawing point, as well as the slightly above average bar food that is offered. I will go back, because options are limited in Madison, IN, but would love to see some tweaks here and there to make it stellar."}
{"text":"Food was alright, decently priced, free fried pickles for hanover students so that was awesome!! But..we waited an hour for boneless wings......server was very apologetic and gave us a discount!"}
{"text":"Just had an incredible meal of sushi at shooters from new sushi chef Toy.   We had several of their specialty rolls and finished them all.  Very fresh and extremely tasty.  The place was very busy, but staff had great attitude and running their tails off to take orders and serve food.  One suggestion would be to add one or two more wait staff."}
{"text":"Sun King's Grapefruit Jungle on tap in Madison, IN?  Yeah they got it!  I was very surprised.  I got a bacon and bleu burger and fries.  I was very satisfied.  I liked the look and feel of this place.  Yeah it might not fit right in with what downtown Madison is trying to do but they got good food and grog so I was happy.  Everyone I was with was pleased.  I will plan another trip there soon."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for wings a burger  a quesadilla At the half way mark told that they were out of tenderloins.  Terrible service and won't be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a terribly good visit to Shooters for my husband and me.  We stopped by on July 4th for a quick lunch during the annual Madison Regatta and found that they were serving a limited menu due to the races in town that weekend.  While we understood the need for them to do so, the offerings remaining on the menu were not terribly appetizing.  We opted for the pulled pork and buffalo chicken sliders, both of which arrived on buns that appeared to have been bathed in grease, as had the meat therein.  The accompanying tater tots were also little cholesterol bombs, though I suppose one would expect them to be.  Shooters did have a nice selection of draft and bottled beer, and the oatmeal stout i ordered was quite good.  Hard to say if our experience was a result of the increased clientele, and more limited menu, associated with the regatta, but we will likely be avoiding Shooters for anything other than a cold drink next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"Madison IN is a cool town with many interesting shops etc...check it out.

This \"Sports bar\" was in a good location but I would say my visit was just ok based on the number / variety of interesting restaurant \"fronts\" that line Main street.

Lots of tvs (14) and several games were available for viewing.
Their beer selection included several Local beers and a good national mix.
I had the fried Fish tail sandwich which was just ok (fried, lacking the \"yum\") the Parmesan bun was the star of the meal.
Fries and Cole slaw meet expectations.
Total was $11 for the meal and a cool Lite beer from Miller.
Service was good. 
Not much unique or of interest here."}
{"text":"Great taco salad! Love their cheese curds. Love the atmosphere-sports bar but not rowdy unless UK is playing IU."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant and left with mixed reviews. After waiting for 22 minutes and complaining to the bartender, the waitress finally made contact with our table. First, she approached the people next to us, and they complained about how our table had been waiting longer than them! The waitress never introduced herself, seemed bothered by us, and was highly rude. She continually forgot to bring things to the table (straws, silverware, etc.). They also forgot to bring plates for our appetizers, so we ate off napkins. We were never asked how our food was or if we needed anything. This is my first review on Yelp, and I felt compelled to make it based on the lowest quality service I have ever received at a restaurant. Based on this experience, I would never visit again."}
{"text":"Just reopened with new owners.  Great place, clean and modern.  Food and service great. Nice to see an alternative in Madison."}
{"text":"99 different brands of beer.  Yes, you read that right, Shooter's has 99 different types of beer and I only had time to try one brand.  At least I'm sure that is the number of beers as I lost count due to a delirious giddiness with the selection in front of me. 

So, on to the food.  I ordered their pulled pork bbq sandwich and upgraded the combo with fries and coleslaw.  The sandwich by itself comes with chips and a pickle. To start my lunch I had their yummy, cheesy and slightly crunchy mozzarella sticks.  

My lunch arrived and instead of being served on a hamburger bun which is what I am used to, the pulled pork arrived on a long hoagie type of bun.  Bonus points to Shooters for being different from other restaurants.  The pork was juicy and tender and was covered with a sweet bbq sauce.  It was very, very good. 

The fries were crisp and very tasty and the coleslaw was fresh and also tasty.  Yeah, this was a damn good lunch and I'm looking forward to a return visit.  Trying more of the beer is on my mind as well as eating something else on their very expansive menu."}
{"text":"Poor service and my wife found a hair in her sandwich. Yuck! Another person next to us had the same experience."}
{"text":"I hope the managers of this cozy, 1980s style bar/restaurant look at their reviews; they really need to work on their scheduling. Every time I come by, I see one of the same couple of girls running around like mad, with no bartender or extra serving staff. The staff do their best, and the food is fantastic Hoosier style bar food with fresh-tasting meat and veg, but I get anxiety just watching how stressed the employees are. The stress level of the staff always rubs off on the experience of the guest- treat your employees well and the guests will be much happier too!

By the way, the beer selection is great (they have a lot of craft options). If you're into sports, this is a great spot to catch a basketball game. Their double bar ensures there are plenty of spots."}
{"text":"Family of four stopped in at 3:20p on Sunday. Sat at a dirty table as we found zero clean. Watched another family come in after us, table immediately cleaned and they were ordering as we had not even been acknowledged.  We sat for 20 minutes and never had one person acknowledge us. Server was a table over from us multiple times and ignored us. We are taking our business elsewhere."}
